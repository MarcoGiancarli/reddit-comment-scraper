Xenoblade_Chronicles,3e69ch,Nezikchened,2,Wed Jul 22 07:29:47 2015 UTC,"When you target enemies, the border will be colored according to the difference between your level and its level.    Black means it is more than five levels below you. Blue means it is 3-5 levels below you. White means it is between 2 levels below and 2 levels above you. Yellow means it is 3-5 levels above you. Orange means it is more than five levels above you.   Don't fight enemies with the orange borders. They have a large speed and accuracy advantage over you, meaning you can't usually hit them or dodge them. You'll have a hard time with yellow, but it is doable. I'd suggest fighting those with white borders for now.  As for the other points, gems can make a world of difference, and you will be able to complete the skill trees. The level caps at 99, and the best way to level up quickly would be to fight Unique Monsters, find Landmarks and do side quests."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3e69ch,Shulks_Lower_Monado,2,Wed Jul 22 08:03:52 2015 UTC,"Positioning wise you can tell whether an enemy is going to ""lock"" to you directionally by a red ring around you, and a yellow marker pointing to the aggro'd enemy. Reyn is a pretty good aggro magnet so if you hang back with auto attacks for a while Reyn should start attracting the enemies.  Skill Trees make some difference, but only in the abilities you want to activate, yes you can fill them all out eventually but it takes a very long time, just take a look at the skills in the tree and decide what you think should take precedence.  From what I've experienced Gear isn't super important at lower levels, really it's just your level that counts at this point. But if you're buying the best gear you can get from the merchants then you should be fine anyway. But the best gear does drop from enemies.  Gems apply small buffs, they're helpful but I'd ignore them while you wrap your head around the other mechanics of the game.  Attempting to fight enemies of +2 levels above you is always risky business, Blue border enemies and White border enemies are what you should be fighting, making sure the white border enemies are around your level, not higher. My tip for combat is learning all your parties moves, and how they can chain together in useful ways, listen to what your party say, as they shout what arts they're doing, and act accordingly. With Shulk I usually start with Back Slash, then Stream Edge, then auto attack waiting for Reyn to Topple the enemy, then Shaker Edge. With other melee attacks between.  I'm not at the point to know whether there's a level cap (I'm level 58 atm) but really I doubt that's something you need to worry about as it's very hard to level above what an area requires.  Levelling quickly really rests on three things, Monster Hunting, Exploration and Side Quests.  Hunt Monsters until their level borders are Blue, then Explore the area around you, filling in the map, then do all the side quests around you, they usually offer a load of XP that you may be missing out on.  Items have spawn points, meaning items will spawn in the same place, but what you get is put to chance, the Xenoblade Wiki has a pretty extensive list of locations and probabilities for each item, but running around and picking up orbs usually works fine for the Collectopaedia. But yes some are rarer than others.  Hope this helps you enjoy the game more, and don't worry the combat gets a lot less confusing once you get to know your team a lot better. Just look up their arts they have assigned, and make sure you know what they're doing during battle."

You've got: the amazing combat, Seven's reveal, the affinity system, Zanza's revival, a few or so plot twists and an AMAZING world to see. Xenoblade is not JUST Gaur Plains, y'know.  Also, since you watched the ending, you must already know of the other party members from Shulk's costumes, Xenoblade trophies and the aformentioned ending. I'll just go through the costumes quickly:   Costume 1: Default Shulk  Costume 2: Fiora , post Mechon transformation. Shulk's love interest  Costume 3: Dunban, Shulk's fatherly figure (seen in Shulk's Chain Attack and appears as a Mii Costume)  Costume 4: Reyn, Shulk's bestest of friends  Costume 5: Sharla, the Sniper/Medic combo /r/tf2 wishes they had  Costume 6: Melia, the High Entia ether mage.  Costume 7: Riki, the lovable Heropon (Also seen in Shulk's Chain Attack and appears as an assist trophy)  Costume 8: Still Shulk, just without any equipment on. Makes sense with Dunban's 'Inner Peace' trait"

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3e3jn0,segonyosoftendo,9,Tue Jul 21 18:04:58 2015 UTC,I'd say start again on the 3ds. MAIN REASON: portability with such an amazing RPG is just incredible
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3e3jn0,Spectur,6,Tue Jul 21 18:51:26 2015 UTC,"I usually prefer playing on handhelds because of convenience but the controls felt slightly weird. Will I get used to them?   Most likely, you will get used to them.   Also how much extra content is in this one? I have a Shulk amiibo so I will be able to use that as well.   The Shulk amiibo will let you unlock tokens that you can spend on extra content - mainly models of characters or places, and the soundtrack.  This is also the major difference in extras between the 3DS version and the Wii version."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3e3jn0,clicky_pen,3,Tue Jul 21 18:58:18 2015 UTC,"If you're able to play it more easily on portable, do that. The Wii is better graphically, of course, and XBC isn't a very graphically intensive game to begin with, but it all really depends on what you feel comfortable with.  You'll most likely get used to the 3DS controls. I personally actually like the 3DS controls better, since there are more buttons and the N3DS thumb-nub makes camera movement so much easier. If you can't get used to it, though, and the benefits of it being mobile aren't enough, you can always just stick with the Wii version."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3e3jn0,Gratefulhost,2,Tue Jul 21 19:23:24 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree, if you can get used to the 3ds controls, the portability makes it worth it. I do think playing it through on the Wii is worth it though, even if its just a bare bones run, since I found many of the later areas gorgeous and that quite doesn't carry over to the small screen"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3e3jn0,DrDreadnought,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:59:32 2015 UTC,I feel like many would argue the wii version is the most definitive. So I'd say start over on that one if you REALLY can't get into the 3ds controls.

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dx4ja,amiibro_swerp,5,Mon Jul 20 06:57:41 2015 UTC,"Xenogears isn't hard, it is just aged, particularly its battle mechanics. You definitely want to get a lot of practice and reading in to understand how it works, particularly unlocking and using both character and gear deathblows. That being said, I would avoid emulating it - there is a bug during a boss fight late in the game that will cause the game to freeze on emulators, and even on legit copies on console occasionally (depending on the console - the only console I know that doesn't freeze is the original PS1). However, Xenogears is also quite rare, so best of luck finding a copy.  Xenosaga is another fantastic series, but response is also a lot more divided than Xenogears or Xenoblade. I for one love the trilogy, but others might not. Xenosaga I and II are fairly common, but Xenosaga III is another very rare game. It's definitely worth checking out, though, if you have a PS2.  Personally, I recommend the Xenosaga trilogy more. I like it more than Xenogears (although Xenogears is also an amazing game), and it's a bit easier to get copies of at least the first two games."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dx4ja,OniLinkMinus,5,Mon Jul 20 08:08:27 2015 UTC,"there is a bug during a boss fight late in the game that will cause the game to freeze on emulators   I don't remember this, and the only way I've played and beaten Xenogears is on ePSXe. It's possible it happened, I looked up how to get around it, and did with minimal fuss.   Valkyrie Profile, on the other hand, is a bitch and a half to emulate when you get to the Disc 1>2 transition. That and GBA game save-type issues come to mind when I think of games that suck to emulate, not Xenogears."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dx4ja,_SnakeDoctor,3,Mon Jul 20 11:26:20 2015 UTC,"Seriously? I've had the bug happen on ePSXe, PCSXR, and a physical PS2. It's the first fight against Deus in disc 2 when Merkavah first appears - if Deus uses an ability to heal itself, the game softlocks"

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dx4ja,AnthonyGriffion,2,Mon Jul 20 12:55:03 2015 UTC,Thank you for the response. I actually don't like emulating and prefer to have a physical copy of the game. I'm going to go to my local retro game store and see if they have Xenogears or Xenosaga :)
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dx4ja,luemasify,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:52:02 2015 UTC,"I would recommend Xenogears because it's still my favourite game of all time a cut above Xenoblade. Pound for pound Xenoblade is a better game (and it should be too since it's a more recent Takahashi game) but Xenogears has a story so deep and detailed it destroys the plot in any other game. Xenoblade had an excellent plot as well, but Xenogears remains the greatest narrative in any videogame to date (imo). However, the gameplay mechanics will eventually get boring (this can be expected of any 80's-90's JRPG anyways) but it's not fair to knock it for that because every single Final Fantasy game during and before Xenogears' time suffered from the same issue. Xenogears does however have a fun and unique battle system that utilizes combos which is still more interesting than FF's turn by turn system and hey if FF7 gets infinite praise, we should all be spreading our buttcheeks apart for Xenogears . I wouldn't say Xenogears is very hard save for 2 or 3 maybe 4 boss battles but there are guides online that can help you out for those particular boss battles and /r/xenogears should be happy to help with how to beat those bosses as well (I'm subscribed there as well). Personally, I found the difficulty in Xenogears to stem from the story; it's very hard to follow at first due to it's complexity and ambiguity but later you see how all these seemingly unrelated story elements cross paths and become this grand narrative. Also it's difficult to really get into the game at first because of course the graphics are quite dated - PS1 hardware was only capable of rendering character models or the environment in 3D, not both at the same time. FF7 decided to render characters in 3D and the environment in 2D and Xenogears went the other way around with 3D environments and 2D character models. Imo this has dated better and if you don't mind playing an older game that isn't necessarily easy on the eyes, Xenogears should be good to go. Also the music is amazing in this game just listen to the Opening theme, and the Airship theme. Finding a used copy at a reasonable price will be difficult I think (this is a cult classic) so emulating is the way to go (OpenEmu for Mac is impeccable and Mednafen appears to be the best for Windows). If you're interested shoot me a PM I can provide both the Rom and the Bios files"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dx4ja,luemasify,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all the information. I prefer having physical copies of games so I will most likely not emulate it.

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dvf3a,linxdev,7,Sun Jul 19 21:14:45 2015 UTC,"You basically have a ""bank"" of affinity tokens that you can use to freely turn linked skills on and off. Say you want to boost Shulk's HP, and Reyn has a skill that boosts HP by 5%, with a circle background, that costs 6 Affinity coins. You have Green affinity between the two of them, so Shulk can equip two of Reyn's skills- one with a circle background, and one with a square background. It takes 6 of your affinty coins, but Reyn's skill is now linked to Shulk, boostin his HP. You can freely turn it off to get the 6 affinity coins back.  As you know, you get a coin every time you level up and every time you beat a Unique Monster, so your team will always have roughly the same number of coins throughout the game. You can never link diamond skills, and certain characters miss out on valuable skills from others since they lack empty skill links in that shape with them. You unlock more empty skill links as your affinity increases, and SP let you get more skills to share with others."

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dus2g,ijustlikecellos,3,Sun Jul 19 17:59:37 2015 UTC,by dodge tank I suppose you mean Dunban  make sure Dunban is using Serene heart  (it helps to hit high level enemies)  I always had the same problem with the rest of the party they kept missing (except Dunban while on Serene heart)so I equipped Dunban with agility down gems for his sword and I remember it helping a lot  if you can't make your whole party hit him may as well bring him down to your level :P (It seemed to work)
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dus2g,Silveratwriting,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:43:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm talking about Dunban. I thought his name would be a spoiler but I guess that was a bit silly haha.  I'll look into the Agility Down gems, thanks.   EDIT: On a side note, is Night Vision unnecessary on Dunban?"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dus2g,kenniky,4,Sun Jul 19 18:49:15 2015 UTC,Generally the first six party members are okay to say the names of. It's just Seven that is kind of a spoiler.
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dus2g,Silveratwriting,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:51:28 2015 UTC,"Late game yeah, it's unnecessary since by the time Serene heart runs out he can activate it again (I don't know if the AI is smart enough to realise though, I played as Dunban most of the time)"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dus2g,Silveratwriting,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:33 2015 UTC,"Serene Heart is maxed out. I think the AI only activates it when it gets the aggro ring. Though, that's probably good enough.  What arts does your Dunban use? Mine uses Serene Heart, Blinding Blossom, Steel Strike, Gale Slash, Worldly Slash, Electric Gutbuster, Soaring Tempest and Battle Eye. Maybe Battle Eye is a bit unnecessary? Especially since you can have only 1 aura active at a time... (please don't recommend Demon Slayer or Thunder... the former is useless as far as I'm concerned and the AI never uses Thunder) maybe less is more in this case?"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dus2g,RQK1996,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:37:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I suggest you yo drop battle eye and put jaws of death (or anything you like really)  also I think one of the requirements for losing aggro is taking damage.... is your Dunban using Agility up gems? mine is using 2 (enough for 50 agility) so if he doesn't take damage while on Serene heart you'll never lose aggro  anyways my Dunban uses:  -Spirit breath (I don't think that boss has any Debuffs but I'm always using it just in case)  -Serene heart (so I can Debuff him with the gem)   -Jaws of death (for when I fuck it up or an ether attack comes in)  -Gale slash (you know it!)  -Electric gutbuster (Party gauge)  -wordly slash (Party gauge)  -steel strike (Topple)  -Blinding blossom (if I need to get his atenttion again after dying maybe?)  Take in mind I'm the one controlling Dunban though but give it a try!
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dus2g,Tables61,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:50:37 2015 UTC,Are you fighting at night with the night vision?
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dus2g,Tables61,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:08:31 2015 UTC,"Of course. Also, they're all mega-heated Night Vision VI gems.   What should Shulk's agility stat be at this point? He has the megaheated Agility Up VI gem, links with the agility boosting skills from Melia and Sharla, weight reducing links from Dundun and is wearing the Lancelot (+Glory Gauntlets) set. What the heck am I doing wrong? :("
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dus2g,Tables61,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:31:56 2015 UTC,"Despotic Arsene has effectively 320 agility, which means even with some boosts to agility, you're likely to struggle to hit with lower agility characters. Like, say your Shulk has about... 110 base agility (not exactly sure, but at low 90's it'll be around there). Add on 50 for gems, about 50 for skill links, I'll assume his equipment weight is reduced to 0, 50 for Night Vision, and you're up to an effective 260. That's still only a 40% hit rate for auto attacks and 65% for arts.  What I'm saying is you generally want every boost you can get. All the agility skills, as well as skills such as those giving temporary boosts against high level foes. Arts like Dive Sobat + Bone Upper on Reyn to drop enemy agility, or Agility Down gems. Skill branches that boost agility. You might not need every single possible boost, but you do effectively need to make up 200 points of agility, so for Reyn and Shulk who have slightly less agility it's a good idea to grab as much as possible.  Weight is simple. 1 Weight = -1 agility. You can see this change as you switch between equipment. Note that if your weight is reduced below 0 then there's no bonus to agility, it just has 0 penalty. So generally that means weight reducing skills are more valuable than other agility skills, as they're more coin efficient, but honestly you should probably use both, at least until your equipment weight is very close to zero (should be easy since most physical fighters are best off with light/medium armour anyway).  AI Reyn Dodge Tank? Yeah, sure. Maxing Reyn's avoid is pretty standard for veterans, but note that he's not going to dodge much against superbosses due to the hit rate thing. A pretty standard arts set would be: Wild Down, Sword Drive, Berserker, Bone Upper, Dive Sobat, Aura Burst, War Swing, Lariat. If you aren't fighting superbosses, replace one of the last two with Shield Bash for daze (superbosses are immune). War Swing is mostly there to combo with either high critical rates or arts heal, since it hits multiple times and lategame, has a pretty short cooldown period. It's damage is pretty mediocre."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dus2g,newbioform,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"Ah by dodge tank I meant Dunban, I wasn't sure what counted as a spoiler. Thanks though, I was still curious about Reyn's best arts anyway haha"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dus2g,newbioform,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:12:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, right. Yeah unless people explicitly request no spoilers, generally the first 6 character names are okay. It's very unsurprising that Dunban joins you, Shulk and Reyn are obvious party members, Sharla, Melia and Riki are first seen very shortly before they join, and that really only leaves Seven as a major spoiler for characters.  Anyway Dunban has a few options. For Auras, Heat Haze and Peerless are his best. Peerless gives crazy good damage to the whole party, while Heat Haze fills the party gauge at stupid speed while healing himself rapidly thanks to Critical Drain. You can replace one with Serene Heart if you want for the avoid and hit rate, but I tend to find it's nowhere near as good as his other two auras. Similar for Spirit Breath - strong aura but he has better (and the AI isn't great with Spirit Breath). Then you usually run Gale Slash, Worldly Slash, Steel Strike and Soaring Tempest - four pretty standard arts for him. The last two slots are where you have some choice. When player controlled, Tempest Kick + Thunder is a very potent combination, but not against superbosses (again, daze immunity) and the AI doesn't know how to Thunder. Electric Gutbuster can be nice, depending on teammates - if you have few or no other break users (usually meaning no Shulk) it can be worthwhile, otherwise there's usually better options. Blinding Blossom is great for grabbing aggro - it also counteracts the aggro lost from Heat Haze, if that ever concerns you. Tempest Kick can still be nice without Thunder as a followup for Gale Slash, most enemies have some annoying buffs."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dtx5n,Honeyguy712,3,Sun Jul 19 12:47:30 2015 UTC,"I found it best to go with the story until you reach a quest hub, then grab as many as you can and go have fun exploring the area while monster kills actually count. Note that the next few areas after Eryth don't have quest hubs. The next one is when you find yourself on a beach.  Don't force yourself to do all the quests, but try to get as many as you can done while exploring (helped by having them at that point). Quests are absolutely great for keeping your level high enough. There are more unique quests as the game goes on, too. For example, you're at the point where you can start a nice quest chain that deals with the pollen orb storehouse (although there are a couple prerequisites)."

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dsxm9,MrExperience,4,Sun Jul 19 03:44:12 2015 UTC,"The main similarity I found between the two games, and one of my favorite things about both, is this theme:  They both have the idea of, given that there is definitely a creator god, maybe even with complete omnipotence. Does a truly deistic being have a right to there creations lives? Both have characters who were created by an ""artificial"" god, and then rebel when that god tries to exercise his/its right to there creations bodies.

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dsxm9,alvinchimp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:09:02 2015 UTC,Thanks! I will have to check this out.
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dsxm9,luemasify,4,Tue Jul 21 13:25:47 2015 UTC,"All the Xeno games have parallels! Also I'm glad you enjoyed Xenogears - it's the single greatest game from my childhood and it remains my personal benchmark for what a great RPG can be. Without spoiling Xenosaga, here's what I noticed between Xenogears and Xenoblade: both have a betrayal from someone close to the MC Dickson and Citan, both have badass swordsmen Dunban and Citan, both have a high tech city in the sky (Alcamoth and Solaris), you already covered how there's an inner being inside the MC, both have a cute and naive yet oddly powerful creature as a party member (Riki and Chu-chu), mechs ofc but that's obvious, both have the use of Ether, the resurrection of a god, a mystic/otherworldly artifact (the Monado and the Zohar modifier), and the last one I can think of off the top of my head is that Egil is basically Krelian because they appear to be the main villian for most of the story but towards the end they no longer are and once you learn about their story, you pity them and feel sorry for their loss. Also they redeem themselves towards the end of their life - Egil more so than Krelian. Also I do HIGHLY recommend playing Xenosaga before X comes out later this year outside if Japan. Xenosaga is no way better than XBC or XG but there are strong connections between X and Xenosaga. I'm not even going to begin talking about them because it's spoilery for both games, but if you want to appreciate X on a even deeper level, having played Xenosaga will give you that satisfaction"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dsxm9,ricobanderas,3,Sun Jul 19 04:38:59 2015 UTC,"Citan never truly betrays you. Dickson does. Citan's intentions are always in Fei's best interest. Also while Krelian and Egil are both sympathetic villains, Egil turns and is humanized while Krelian is not. Just sayin'."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dsxm9,luemasify,3,Sun Jul 19 09:11:55 2015 UTC,"Except at first Citan's intentions were to follow the orders of Cain but he even said himself he had a change of heart. Also he's still responsible for putting Fei into the hands of Cain during the mission on Solaris which warranted an escape, and lead to the death of Elly's mother and father. Also I disagree that Citan operates as per Fei's best interests. He put him into that stasis on Solaris just so he could talk to Id. Was anything accomplished by him doing that? Fei didn't reign in permenant control his subconscious at that point and Id would have awakened soon after and destroyed Solaris regardless so what was Citan's angle? Let me rephrase what I said: the similarities aren't that Dickson and Citan betray the MC, the similarities are that every xeno game has one massive asshole. Dickson and Citan are said assholes. Dickson shoots shulk when he's vulnerable and is responsible for meyneth's death. He also tries to hit on Sharla right in front of Reyn - what a jerk! Citan allows Fei and Elly to get that deep into Solaris because he wanted to put Fei into stasis all so he could talk to Id in safety. If nothing was accomplished by this then the only other explanation is he did it out of curiosity (I wouldn't put that past him considering his track record). He fully cockblocks Fei and Elly in the black forest when he tells Elly to take a hike. He had a freakin sword in his possession this whole time but he didn't even bother to take it out until late in the game because of his ""morals"". How many lives could he and Fei had saved if he was fighting at full capacity and not just using his fists? This dude just lets Fei and Elly eat food in Solaris that he knows is made from human flesh and doesn't bother to stop them even when the production facility is minutes away and they're on their way there. He knows Fei's entire past and that he's basically a weapon of mass destruction yet he keeps that to himself the entire game. He was stationed in Lahan by Cain as a spy to keep an eye on Fei and even though he knew his past, he still shows him Emeralda's music box right before the invasion full well knowing the negative emotions it'll bring up from Kim's lifetime thus serving as a catalyst to awaken Id. This dude wanted to see Id in action and as a result, Lahan was destroyed and many people died including Fei's best friends Timothy and Alice. Did he take Fei's best interests into account there? Nah. He barely ever did until later in the game  Also the reason I said Egil is basically Krelian is because they both lost someone close to them (Egil lost his friend Arglas and Krelian lost mother Sophia) and this led them down a road of hate and anger to defy/manipulate a god. In Egil's case, he defied Zanza and tried to kill him and in Krelian's case he tried to create a god and later on settled with enhancing an existing Deus. Believe me, I like Egil wayy more than Krelian (I still hate Krelian for sure) but what Krelian said at the end of the game was something along the lines of ""I'm too far gone"" made me sympathize for him a little bit. Also I don't personally feel this way, but I can see how after all that's happened, some players would forgive Krelian for all the wrong he's done (testing on humans, obsessing over Elly and wanting to keep her for himself, etc.) because he lost his humanity and. This draws parallels with Egil because I forgave him for what he did after he sacrificed himself to save the party despite what he did to Seven and Gadolt and what not. Egil definitely redeemed himself far more than Krelian, but neither were the bad guy at the end of their games which is where the parallel comes from"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dsxm9,ricobanderas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"For the record I didn't downvote you, dunno who did... but halfway through your first paragraph the response came across as parody, kind of nitpicking Citan's choices and labeling them as treacherous (cockblock notwithstanding, how DARE he.) I will admit 'best interests' was perhaps a bit strong.  Yes Citan and Dickson are both all knowing observers, and are both double (in Citan's case, triple) agents, but barring a philosophical debate about morality, Citan's interests are basically 'good,' his interference is not the direct cause of plight or destruction. Dickson, on the other hand, is directly guiding Zanza's plan to fruition, and reveals himself to be directly aligned against the protagonist. I can't draw any parallels between these characters.  Also I don't mean to cop out (I also don't feel like writing a ton on Krelian), but Egil and Krelian for me are far too different to merit any kind of comparison. And it can't really be simplified into whether they are sympathetic or not, or how they both desire to manifest as a new god. Their stories and motives are extremely different."

Mira is as miraclous a planet as you can get, so much that it border lines on actually being Eden if you read the back story of the game. The game focuses significantly more on world building of the survival stories of the humans and aliens than the mysteries of Mira.

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dsxm9,luemasify,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:46:50 2015 UTC,"It's not so strong of a tie that it'll warrant Xenosaga as a must play before playing XBX, but I imagine it's there to thank fans who've stuck with the series since Xenogears (plus the perfect works universe is Takahashi's brainchild so it makes sense if he wants to keep that lore going however he can). I got a lot of the story elements in XBX spoiled so I don't want to get into details, but from the looks of it XBX takes place right after the end of Xenosaga ep3. There's another connection that I don't even want to begin to talk about because it'll take the fun out of the surprise, but I will say that you don't need to play through all 3 Xenosaga games to appreciate this particular reference/story element/connection in XBX. Also there's a large number of screengrabs floating around the internet that spoils this particular thing I'm talking about so you're better off not googling any of the characters from XBX on google images - please just trust me .   So basically to the best of my current knowledge, XBX appears to have a stronger connection with Xenosaga than it does with Xenogears and Xenoblade (save for the small references we've already seen such as Lyn's Monado hairclip)"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dsxm9,OniLinkMinus,-1,Sun Jul 19 06:55:19 2015 UTC,"Except it's literally impossible for Xenoblade X to take place post-Xenosaga III.  Xenosaga spoilers:  The main reason why is a major plot point in Xenosaga is that humans are the ONLY intelligent life in the universe, which is clearly contradicted by Xenoblade X having so many alien species. Humans set out to the stars, expecting to find other life, but they were the only ones. So they created life - the Realians. By the time of the Miltian Conflict, humans did come to find another form of life - the Gnosis. However, it comes to light in Xenosaga III that the Gnosis ARE humans. They are human consciousness which have refused to join the collective in death. Humans really are all there is in the universe of Xenosaga, which is precisely why it cannot be the same universe as Xenoblade X.  Xenoblade X spoilers:  Furthermore, Xenoblade X is clearly established to take place starting 2 years 2 months after July 2054 - i.e. approximately September 2056, give or take a few months. The destruction of Earth occurred in July 2054, the White Whale crashed to Mira two years later in 2056, and the game begins two months after the crash. Xenosaga, on the other hand, take place ~4000 years after Earth is destroyed in the 21st century. While humans were lied to quite a lot in Xenoblade X, there is no reason to lie to them about that, especially as several crew members such as Nagi, Lynlee, Elma, and pretty much all of the core BLADE members, were all conscious during the 2 year voyage.  EDIT: What's with the downvotes being thrown around? Me, luemasify, and ricobanderas all got wrongfully downvoted."

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dscq2,CrimsonEnigma,5,Sun Jul 19 00:07:05 2015 UTC,"Before Colony 6 was destroyed, it had a fleet of pods (similar to the ones the High Entia use) that they used to travel to Sword Valley. As for why the High Entia act like they never have seen Homs before when so many are half Homs, it's because the royal family takes one Homs per generation to serve as the second consort. I suspect many of the part-Homs High Entia are distantly related to the royal family. As for how the Homs feel about one of their own being taken by the royal family, I suspect that the Homs that go to the High Entia are just labelled as missing. Not to mention, there are Homs travellers who may have encountered the High Entia before. Tales from these travellers are taken as myth by many of the rest of the Homs, and they reach the Bionis Head so rarely that the High Entia have met many Homs before, but it's still highly uncommon."

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dscq2,PrimalPower,2,Sun Jul 19 14:45:50 2015 UTC,"We know that early on, the High Entia had pods going throughout Bionis.   I imagine that during those ancient times, the Homs and High-Entia interacted with each other. And perhaps a small group of Homs even lived near Alcamoth.   As the contact between the High Entia and the Lower-Levels of Bionis petered out. I imagine that the Homs living with the High Entia eventually bred into the population.   Kind of how Neathredrals bred into the homo sapiens, but significantly less amounts of generations (not to mention that high entia generations are probably much longer than homs generations). So the high entia still have significant percentage of homs blood."

I was thinking of a Homs colony that actually live on the shoulder and interact with the High Entia. They only interact between the shoulder and head, and it wouldn't be common for Homs to enter Alcamoth until a second consort is needed."

My strategy is to go all out on one at a time and kill it, then even if I die, it's still gonna be dead, so I have less to deal with.  You're almost at a perfect level. Ideally I'd say you want to be level 55. Sword Valley has four quests you can try to get some extra experience, but DO NOT expect to beat them, especially the one with the mechon behind gate 3. They're surprise quests, so you have to go to the right places to find them. Typically you get them at outposts, and one is received at a tower north of where you fought Metal Face."

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dpgbk,duvangrgataonea,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:29:32 2015 UTC,"I play as Reyn in order to pull aggro better, I can usually get all aggro off the ai Shulk and Sharla completely so they can focus on doing their damage. If you have it unlocked at that point, berserk is the aura I primarily use to initially draw aggro since it makes his aggro skills aoe then switch to rage and guard shift their attacks. I do think playing as Shulk generates more party gauge in the long run since he has a lot of skills with position crits, but then you have to worry about aggro. If you find yourself wiping because some of the enemies are aggroing your Shulk, try Reyn."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dpgbk,duvangrgataonea,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:40:01 2015 UTC,"Leave it to reyn! I'll give him a go right now, see how it turns out. Do i keep shulk and sharla too? i hear Melia's AI is rubbish (Gamexplain review on xenoblade), is shulk's AI good?  Also, I hear this term come up a lot, but i don't really understand it. What exactly is burst affinity? i understand affinity, as in the relationship of each character and that you get affinity by encouraging them in battle, but i don't know what burst affinity is. Thank you!  Woops! i just read the tutorial now on affinity in battle, seems like a stupid question now lol. I only just read about ""tension"" in that tutorial. is that aggro?"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dpgbk,Draikmage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:53:45 2015 UTC,"Shulk's ai is eh, like you can position yourself as Reyn so Shulk is at their side or back. He'll backslash their sides or slit edge their back, but as long as you go with one he'll at least contribute. The only ai that does its job as well as a human would is Sharla I think, so there's really no need to play her. Burst affinity is the little prompt to press the button sometimes when a character misses, dodges, or crits. Land the prompt and you build up tension and party gauge, so it's real important. Tension is basically a characters morale, the higher it is the more crits and dodges you'll get. You want to break visions to build tension and make everyone's portraits on fire, and when they're sad stand near them and encourage.  Edit: also from your other post, Dunban can indeed work as a tank if you have agility gems on hand. Agility is basically Dunban's strength as it allows him to tank hits by dodging everything and deal tons of crits. Riki can work as a tank too, but you will have to play as him as the ai doesn't hold aggro too well."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dpgbk,Draikmage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:51:49 2015 UTC,"So all I have to do is to position Shulk in the right place for his back slash slit edge and air slash! Reyn's art (it's name I can't remember) where he holds his striker up as a shield and then counters, should I be using that? I replaced it ages ago for War Swing.   Ah, so the character portraits do matter! I'm playing on the 3ds, so I haven't really taken notice to it before, thought it was just there for fun lol. I suppose it'd be easier on the Wii. With breaking visions, do I need at least one of the bars in the party gauge to be filled? I noticed I can warn my allies sometimes, and then other times I can't.  Agility increases dodging? Wow I haven't equiped anyone with agility gems cos I thought it increases your speed in battle! Fail haha! Dunban is centred mainly around his sword art (forget this name too) that all of his other arts get bonus debuts and what not from. I played him as a reyn clone! I play Riki when I'm not in boss battles like metal face etc. I like to stick to shulk/reyn/sharla in those situations, but Riki does play well. I prefer him to shulk in some cases"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dpgbk,Muffinmurdurer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:13:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, guard shift is veeeery useful in junction with rage because of the spike on rage. I think it blocks topples from the enemy too. War swing is useful mainly for building up aoe aggro and talent guage for mad taunt, but if you have berserk you can taunt in an aoe and rage builds up the gauge slowly.   As for visions, yeah it costs one third of the party bar to warn but it resets all cooldowns so it's pretty useful. Mainly warning Shulk for speed or shield is good or Sharla if Reyn is low.  And yeah, some of that stuff really isnt specified too well in the tutorials lol. Tension is really important and agility is too, dodging 75% of enemy attacks as Dunban is no joke. Also, if you haven't upgraded Colony 6 to level 1 and obtained the mini gem crafter, you won't be able to return there for a while after the boss battle you're heading to. It might be too late to say, but the gem crafter is useful and I reccomend doing the repair quests when it becomes available again."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dn3si,Sir_Teatei_Moonlight,2,Fri Jul 17 16:47:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's based on a specific formula, or at least, not a function of your level. From what I've heard, people who have hacked character stats up don't get reset to the correct level upon their next level up and instead just stay extremely high (going up slightly) suggesting that there's simply an addition to your stats each level, or that it's something based on your previous stats I suppose. That said, I've never hacked it myself, so maybe there is a formula to it.  Either way I don't think anyone has done any research into it. I've been curious about it, because as you say, you can generally only find stats at level 99 or joining level and that isn't all that helpful (since you never even reach level 99 in a typical playthrough). Maybe on my next playthrough I'll try and collect character stats at each level. Might be able to spot a pattern to it all."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dn3si,Tables61,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:17:36 2015 UTC,"Well I do have stats for Shulk and Reyn for level 1 through 6. For strength, ether, and agility, they all get a fixed increase every level, but for HP the increase steadily decreases. So something funny's going on (maybe the fixed increases are actually decreasing, but are getting rounded?)."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dn3si,Tables61,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:55:29 2015 UTC,"Hm, HP definitely increases less as your level increases, that's certainly normal. I wouldn't be too surprised if the other stats had a linear increase or if they decreased slightly over time. Maybe post the numbers you have and also extrapolate to level 99, see if it seems reasonably accurate? If so, they it's probably a fixed increase. If not, then it probably decreases but at a lesser rate."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dn3si,Tables61,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:45:38 2015 UTC,"Okay so I did some minor hacking, and apparently whoever's in slot 1 when you finish the prologue gets force-downgraded to level 1 when the next area loads. By doing this I got a level 1 Fiora. Normally, her min level is 2 with 222 HP, but at level 1 she has 65 HP, and going up to level 2 leads to 129 HP. Other stats show similar incorrectness. So I think that's confirmation that the game is adding values to stats, based on a formula, as opposed to setting stats to values.  So I guess this means that while Fiora technically has 65 HP at level 1 and 129 at lv2, since she actually has 222 at lv2 and the difference is 64, ""in-universe"" it should actually be 158.  I think I might be doing further research before outing any more findings. My current plan is to use EXP multipliers to start gathering a bunch of raw numbers.  I wonder if the game will cough up a ""level-down"" if negatives are involved."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dn3si,Tables61,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:56:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I would be more interested in seeing what happens when you take your underlevelled Fiora to level 3, 4, 5 and compare her HP to what happens normally when you reach level 3, 4, 5 etc."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dn3si,Tables61,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:33:14 2015 UTC,"Good idea. I went and did some poking there and found very weird things indeed: for example, lv1-hacked Fiora gets +3 to agility every level (up to lv7) instead of proper-game Fiora's +2. Her HP also goes up very slightly faster: for example, normal Fiora gets +61 from 2 to 3, while hacked Fiora gets +63. Even weirder, she has slightly less EXP than Shulk and Reyn, yet levels up very slightly earlier. Strange all around."

The pacing is pretty bad throughout the game, but it's the most intricate and detailed narratives I've seen from any form of media.

Not as good as XB or XG, but still really good."

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3db43p,systemchronos,2,Thu Jul 16 02:49:15 2015 UTC,"I also played The Last Story a few years ago right before I started playing Xenoblade and I really enjoyed that game. However, there are a few things to consider. First off, it's a very short game by JRPG standards so don't be surprised if you finish the game in 20-30 hours. The combat is very fun and I enjoyed it a lot and also the music is really good (Hero Theme is my favourite and it's up there with some of Xenoblade's greatest tracks). I guess you could say the experience might be a little dampened after playing XBC, but it's still a very good game and I recommend it for sure. Lastly, for those who've enjoyed XBC, I can't talk about games I would recommend without mentioning Takahashi's first original creation: Xenogears. This game changed the way I looked at videogames when I first played it and it's still as amazing as I remember (played it last month). It's gonna be a difficult game to get your hands on because of course you'd need to own a PS1 and find a used copy soooooooo just know that PS1 emulators and roms can be found ._. and shoot me a PM if you're really interested. Also the music is phenomenal and imo it's an overall better soundtrack than XBCdon'tkillme"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3db43p,Albafika,2,Wed Jul 15 04:23:32 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, thanks for the recommendation! I started playing The Last Story two days ago, and although I knew it might not be on par with XBC, I still enjoyed its different game elements. Fortunately I'm enjoying it so far. And for what it is, it's a really beautiful game.   :)  Edit: oh yeah,  also thanks for the heads up on The Last Story's game length. At least now I can expect it.  And on a side note, I'm interested to see this game with ""better"" music."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3db43p,Albafika,2,Thu Jul 16 02:20:34 2015 UTC,"Glad you're enjoy The Last Story! It really is a nice game and the character development is very well thought out. When you're doing really well in battle and during some points in the story the Hero Theme plays and it's definitely my favourite piece from the game. This is also for sure (well imo) Nobuo Uematsu's best work since the early days of Final Fantasy (I still enjoy the title screen music in Final Fantasy 1 and 2 and I leave it playing every time I play it).      The thing about music is it's very subjective but I have no issue voicing my praise for Xenogears' soundtrack because it's JUST SO DAMN GOOD and (also imo) Yasunori Mitsuda's best work trumping Chrono Trigger - which is a very well loved game. When I first booted up Xenogears and I saw the opening cutscene as well as the accompanying music I knew I was in for a very different, darker, and grander story than your average Final Fantasy game. 90's RPGs just HAVE to have an airship theme and Wings is without a doubt my favourite one. It feels exactly like the kind of music you'd want to be listening to if you were actually on one of those airships. Flight plays during one of the most pivotal, emotionally stirring moments in gaming from my younger years and it holds up flawlessly among tracks from today's games. I would keep going but I don't want to spoil the rest of the great tracks in this game - there's a lot of variety too and I highly recommend you check out those 3 songs ;).

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dcg5x,WillingfordXIV,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:19:15 2015 UTC,"Good luck completing all the Affinity Links. As a completionist, I see myself going for 999 Affinity Coins long before trying to get all the Affinity Links - mainly because I'll never truly know if I've done all the sidequests optimally and talked to everybody I need to at every time I need to.  Getting 999 Affinity Coins sounds absolutely terrible, but one the other hand, I've played all the way to Satorl Marsh in my New Game+ playthrough in under an hour. Rushing through the game enough times to get 999 coins will take a lot less time than it took me to complete my entire first playthrough, if I can continue this pace."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3dcg5x,Tables61,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:22:26 2015 UTC,Honestly getting all of the affinity links isn't terribly difficult. There aren't any that disappear afaik. besides the ones in Alcamoth obviously. Just talk to the NPCs during different hours of the day and while they're not involved in a quest.

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3d5ga8,Rayquaza3010,7,Tue Jul 14 10:58:57 2015 UTC,On my latest playthrough I discovered that you can actually see it from Sword Valley if you are near the entrance to Galahad Fortress.

Makna Forest is basically I giant part that jets out the back of Bionis with another part right above it being Eryth Sea. Then Eryth see is held together in a cup looking part.

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3d5ga8,robotortoise,2,Mon Jul 13 21:08:41 2015 UTC,I've heard. Perhaps I shall check out TCRF if there are people of the same interest; if you haven't seen this already. Why would you want to swap the cutscenes? xD  Edit: OH! So that is TCRF. I've used that page a couple time... never really remembered the source though. Are you saying there is a whole community at TCRF willing to learn the game's binary?
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3d5ga8,AnthonyGriffion,2,Mon Jul 13 21:16:12 2015 UTC,You know it. You and robotortoise have helped me with opening maps and finding weird and hidden stuff.

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3d34hq,planetarial,2,Mon Jul 13 04:53:08 2015 UTC,"The story really is the best part of the game, but your situation need not detract your experience. You can try and just not think about things too hard and immerse yourself in the game. Try to re experience the story from the character's perspectives as you are now playing it. Combat and exploration are also still big parts of the game, I can't tell you how amazing it is entering Gaur Plains for the first time in a playthrough or climbing up a tall cliff to discover a secret area with a view of the whole place. It's also fun trying out different specialisations for each character and devising strategies for different compositions then testing them out on a high level monster. A lot of my time was spent optimizing equipment and arts for each character and practicing chain attacks. There is more than enough content in Xenoblade to be enjoyed even for a second playthrough, you should be fine."

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3d1zd7,AnthonyGriffion,4,Sun Jul 12 21:43:25 2015 UTC,"This seems like it could take a very long time, just to get shut down by Nintendo.   That being said, this would be amazing if fully realised. Give it support with the HD texture pack, and itll be all good."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3d1zd7,PhoenixBurning,5,Sun Jul 12 22:53:25 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of the HD texture pack work. That seems to be the only thing people have done with this game, hence why my ideas are so ambitious. I'm also aware off Nintendo possibly shutting this down. However, those who have worked on things such as Project M were successful and seems to be worth it. Back to the HD texture pack, if you've used cheats to visit the Left Shoulder, or viewed the model, there are already some textures that are incomplete. That teams help would be appreciated, but that is if they are willing to help."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3d1zd7,OniLinkMinus,3,Sun Jul 12 22:57:54 2015 UTC,"Well, if we wanted to do this, first we'd need to figure out the ROM without breaking any laws. That would probably take years by itself, and Nintendo of Japan would probably love to jump on sending a C&D."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3d1zd7,BlockBuilder57,4,Sun Jul 12 22:58:09 2015 UTC,"I've already cracked the game open... but only to what has already been possible. I have no prior experience with modding. That being said, I'm willing to get started. But this is just the idea phase. I'm aware it would take a long time. Possibly longer than the time I would want it out, the 10th anniversary of Xenoblade Chronicles. Whether Nintendo sends a C&D is 50-50 by me. The success of projects like Project M intrigues me. But I'm aware it is risky."

If you mean, that I have access and can view the map model, then yes. P.S. I have no prior modding experience, but I'm ready to get started.

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3czy21,Salmontaxi,15,Sun Jul 12 08:41:43 2015 UTC,"Well the boring real world logical explanation is that as a JRPG Xenoblade needed a cute character race like how Final Fantasy has moogles and how Xenogears had chu-chu. In terms of in-game continuity I'd guess it has something to do with how Zanza longed for friendship so he created a sentient race that was innocent at heart and ""childlike"" because children are naive and are more likely to form an innocent friendship than adults. For example even adult Nopon act childish (Riki's 40 years old and even he sometimes says he wants to play with the monado during chain attacks lol).  Also the Japanese VA for Riki has a very childlike voice so I think Zanza's logic was that children are pure and don't really have much evil in their hearts like adults do. Also since Zanza was once human, it makes sense that these presumptions about the nature of children were instilled in him during his past prior to the events of the game     Edit: Tldr; Monolith Soft and Zanza were both feeling kawaii"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3czy21,luemasify,12,Sun Jul 12 09:36:22 2015 UTC,"So in other words, yes. Zanza was feeling kawaii."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3czy21,Shulks_Lower_Monado,3,Sun Jul 12 13:28:13 2015 UTC,basically lol
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3czy21,luemasify,4,Sun Jul 12 18:10:20 2015 UTC,Nopon use wood and stuff for bridges and made their house out of a tree. They won't leave. Ever. And Zanza Doesn't want them to.

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3czui7,Shulks_Lower_Monado,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:57:19 2015 UTC,I'm personally curious as to what the results would be if everyone was asked their top 3 or asked to order each character from most to least favorite and award points based on that.

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,0nirayju,7,Sat Jul 11 01:23:29 2015 UTC,"I'll disagree with /u/ButterHotDog  None of those games he mentioned are like Xenoblade.   From what we hear, Xenoblade X won't have a story as focused as Xenoblade, and there won't be a tight-knit cast of characters with whom the plot revolves around like Shulk, Reyn, Riki, Sharla, Dunban, Dickson...etc. Then Xenoblade X won't give you that. Plus, it comes out in six months and you're probably looking for something to play now.   Xenogears and Xenosaga kind of will due to similar writers and developers, (Honestly Xenogears has so many irrelevant characters that its cast comes nothing close to Xenoblade Chronicles). But those games are more or less old school for different reasons, and won't give you the same overworld nor gameplay experience as Xenoblade Chronicles. As Xenogears, and Xenosaga follow a somewhat turn-based system. Plus those two games won't give you the sense of openness like Xenoblade did. Keep in mind that Xenoblade Chronicles was created to be the perfect game as a response to the critical failures of Xenosaga  And personally, I found Xenogear's plot to be less refined/edited compared to Xenoblade's. Xenogears gets praised for its plot, but Xenogear's plot felt like a rough draft that had bitten more than it could chew. In comparison, Xenoblade's plot felt like it had gone through multiple revisions to the point where everything flowed well and fit nicely.   Honestly, the only game that felt even slightly similar (but was still very different) to Xenoblade Chronicles that I found was Final Fantasy 12. Due to its vast overworld, and flexible gameplay system. The plot is very different however, as the story is more political rather than emotional. But it's done well."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,PrimalPower,6,Sat Jul 11 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"This is probably the most accurate post here.   I'll point out here: Xenoblade X will use the same gameplay system as Chronicles, just improved and more complex, in addition to basically playing as the Face Armor found in Chronicles as an endgame feature.  If you want more of an epic plot ""Xenoblade"" and a focus on story, look for the previous ""Xeno"" entries, in addition to any JRPG developed by MonolithSoft (see: Baten Kaitos).  However, for straight up similar gameplay, XII and Chronicles X will be your best bet.  SW:TOR was mentioned above, but if you're going to list that one, you might as well mention almost every western MMORPG in the post-WoW era. World of Warcraft is, in gameplay and questing aspects, objectively similar to Xenoblade."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,iamwall,2,Sat Jul 11 03:25:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't mention SWTOR. I mentioned KOTOR, which is much more similar to Xenoblade in terms of gameplay, story, and characters (and much better, too, but I won't get into that here)"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,Gratefulhost,5,Sat Jul 11 15:00:16 2015 UTC,"I aksed this question awhile ago on the jrpg subreddit, I'll just give ya a link to it instead of copy pasting things everyone said.   https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/2d7eno/games_with_similar_gameplay_to_xenoblade/"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,XxXGodXxX,9,Fri Jul 10 21:27:58 2015 UTC,"Xenoblade Chronicles X (coming out on 12/4 in US) has similar gameplay but is a completely new and fresh experience. Remember that it is a spiritual successor to XBC and does not have the original characters (Shulk, Reyn, Dunban, ect.)  Games from the Xeno series:   (all games have different characters, gameplay, and story)  Xenogears (HIGHLY recommend)  Xenosaga I,II,II (Haven't played)"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,ButterHotDog,5,Fri Jul 10 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"/r/user/lax4 Xenogears gets +1 from me as well. Still one of (if not the top) greatest RPG I've ever played and no game comes even close to the level of depth and complexity of its story. If you loved Xenoblade's story, Xenogears will blow you out of the water and possibly ruin the plot of every other game you play (it did for me) because none will come close to topping it. Also Xenoblade borrows a lot of story and character elements from Xenogears (go figure they're both Takahashi games) so if you're okay with playing an older game and the graphics don't bother you, you owe it to yourself to check it out. The music in the game is amazing as well which comes as no surprise considering it was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger)"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,luemasify,2,Sat Jul 11 01:36:42 2015 UTC,"xenogears +1, best game story ever EDIT : next to suikoden 2"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,forgestone,3,Sun Jul 12 20:55:51 2015 UTC,Story wise? The other Xeno games  Gameplay wise? Final Fantasy XII
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,planetarial,3,Sat Jul 11 03:25:05 2015 UTC,Final Fantasy XII has a similat combat system.
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,PityUpvote,5,Sat Jul 11 05:39:56 2015 UTC,"It's not a JRPG, but I actually think Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a game Xenoblade fans would enjoy. It has a somewhat similar battle system (with auto-attacks, ""arts,"" and character class roles), tons of side content, beautiful aesthetics despite tech limitations (I mean, it's a Star Wars game, of course it's going to be beautiful), and an absolutely classic story. KotOR 2 even has a party affinity system. It seems like XCX is borrowing a lot from KotOR and early Bioware games in general, with the branching story, semi-silent protagonist, and more hard-RPG mechanics."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,Gratefulhost,3,Fri Jul 10 21:56:05 2015 UTC,Huh. Never thought of that comparison but I can certainly see it now.
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,kimpy7,2,Fri Jul 10 23:03:57 2015 UTC,"A while after finishing Xenoblade, I picked up The Last Story. It has a lot of similarities, but is still quite different - and I love it. The story moves along much more quickly and its a lot shorter. It's definitely worth playing through."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,NeverEndingRadDude,2,Sat Jul 11 03:07:45 2015 UTC,"Final fantasy xii. It looks, plays, and feels a bit like Xenoblade https://youtu.be/xu0UfllazNc?t=7m38s  You'll like it. It is a great game."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cuc6i,BioOrpheus,2,Sat Jul 11 21:14:12 2015 UTC,"Apart from the suggestions above, the Tales series (Abyss, Vesperia, Symphonia) are worth giving a whirl if you liked Xenoblade. Similarly expansive plot, better character development, large maps, some exploration and sidequests. The fighting style is more ARPG or fighting game styled, with artes, combos, skills, etc., so it is faster paced."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cps37,OniLinkMinus,5,Thu Jul 9 20:13:09 2015 UTC,"I greatly want to thank you for this. As you said, after falling in love with Xenoblade on Wii, I've grown interested in Takahashi's and Monolith's past works. I've recently starting playing Gear because people say it is the best story in a game ever! Saga on the other hand, I've only heard good things about Episode one, with it getting worse from there. But I'd still like to check it out. I don't even know what the gameplay looks like. I'll have to take my time watching this however. I'm rewatching Chugga's playthrough on Chronicles to make notes on something I want to share soon."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cps37,AnthonyGriffion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:47:41 2015 UTC,"With Xenosaga, the general consensus is Xenosaga I is a decent JRPG, Xenosaga II is pretty bad, and Xenosaga III is objectively the best. Hell, I'd personally say that on its own, even without the other two Xenosagas, Xenosaga III is probably the best JRPG ever made (in my opinion). As an added bonus, Xenosaga III includes an optional plot summary of Xenosaga I and II on the title screen, so you don't even need to play the other two (although I do recommend it)."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cps37,Acetylsalicylin,2,Thu Jul 9 21:52:11 2015 UTC,"While I agree that, as a whole, XS2 is probably my least favorite Xenosaga game, I attribute that to the horrendously slow pacing at the start of the game.  It takes so long to get into actual dungeon areas, and the first ones are kinda repetitive and shitty (referring to Subconscious Domain Summer and Winter).  Disc 2 is much better about this, and some of the many sidequests are pretty good (while some really suffer from annoying run-back-and-forth-through-10-different-areas shit).  Its most redeeming factor was that it actually reintroduced mechs as an important element - they felt so tacked-on and completely unnecessary as AGWS in XS1"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cps37,AnthonyGriffion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:42:02 2015 UTC,"I for one really do enjoy Xenosaga II. Whenever I play through, the changes always catch me off guard every time, especially the changed VAs and KOS-MOS's new look, but by the time we get to the car chase I've warmed up to it, and by the time I do the sliding block puzzles I'm hooked fully. I was just trying to speak in terms of what the general consensus was."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cps37,PrimalPower,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:48:57 2015 UTC,"I just hope they remake the series, or have a separate team work on it. I don't think I can afford the collection. Plus my resources would be going to the project I hope to share."

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3co52b,PhoenixBurning,4,Thu Jul 9 12:39:48 2015 UTC,Pics of inside art book and your collection? Im intrigued.

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3co52b,OniLinkMinus,2,Thu Jul 9 17:14:12 2015 UTC,I'm surprised that the Complete Guide you have there has Mechon Fiora on the cover. Seeing that on the internet or in a store when you haven't beaten the game would be pretty spoileriffic!
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3co52b,Mokron,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:10:25 2015 UTC,How is The Last Story related to Xenoblade?
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3co52b,JoseHerrias,3,Thu Jul 9 17:16:14 2015 UTC,"Xenoblade Chronicles, The Last Story and Pandora's were promoted as ""the three Wii-RPGs"" in Europe but they don't share anything else. Different developers, different gameplay, different story."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3co52b,JoseHerrias,2,Thu Jul 9 17:56:23 2015 UTC,"They were referred to as Operation Rainfall in the U.S. Fans had a massive petition to get them ported, and eventually they all made it over."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3co52b,CitrusChrome,6,Thu Jul 9 20:20:55 2015 UTC,I didn't even know that this existed until just now.
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3co52b,Fan-of-Simon-Pegg,6,Thu Jul 9 13:28:15 2015 UTC,"I managed to get one of these. They were handed out for those who bought Pandora's Tower Special Edition on day of release. None of the employees seemed to know about it and neither did I, but one of them stopped me as I was leaving to give me mine. Apparently there were posters for those who pre-ordered Xenoblade from Gamestation, never got mine, makes me wonder if they even existed.   Not just an art book either, there was also a slipcase with it that houses all three games. Really awesome. I'll find a pic of mine later.  I don't think I've ever even seen these on eBay since. Makes me wonder what my collection is worth considering I have the coins as well.

Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cp9kf,charizard6377,11,Thu Jul 9 17:55:03 2015 UTC,"Not for me. I haven't watched anything regarding Xenoblade X since E3 2014's trailer. I ignored the 2014 Treehouse stuff, avoided the Japanese launch trailers, and the only thing I'm spoiling myself on is the music.   I'm so excited to play X."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cp9kf,rockincellist,2,Thu Jul 9 17:57:29 2015 UTC,I too still want to play it and I have avoided what's out as much as possible but I don't know to me something feels different I'm just not as excited as I was before.
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cp9kf,Gratefulhost,4,Thu Jul 9 18:08:00 2015 UTC,"That might actually be a result of you avoiding the promotional material. What Nintendo puts out is supposed to get you excited for the game, and if you avoid it, then of course your excitement is going to die down."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cp9kf,Nakkio,2,Thu Jul 9 18:28:41 2015 UTC,That did work but then it was released and the wait started and I got less and less excited.
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cp9kf,PrimalPower,3,Thu Jul 9 18:37:06 2015 UTC,That's kinda normal. It's the hype phase. You start excited then cool down then near the game release you get hyped again :p or.. at least it works that way for me.
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cp9kf,PrimalPower,3,Fri Jul 10 19:13:42 2015 UTC,"No, because I don't know shit about the game except 5 contintents, Skells, Elma, Lyn, and Doug. And the bad guys are aliens.    I don't know any of the lore nor do i know anything about the world."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cp9kf,jddaepicboss,2,Thu Jul 9 18:34:28 2015 UTC,"I know very little as well but I just don't feel excited anymore, maybe its just me."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,3cp9kf,garion333,3,Thu Jul 9 18:42:10 2015 UTC,"Perhaps its just the concept.   Personally I feel like Xenoblade's opening cutscene and concept is much more intriguing than Xenoblade X's. Not to mention the title screen.   So even now, I remember being more excited for Xenoblade than I am for Xenoblade X.   Two titans, this mysterious Monado sword, what are the mechon and why are they attacking, the dynamic between dunban, dickson and mumkhar. HOLY SHIT DUNBAN's charging THAT's SO EPIC....did he survive?   Always felt like a better hook than Xenoblade X's alien attack and crash landing.   Maybe that's why?   Xenoblade Chronicles takes place on a completely different universe, with god-like titans and a mysterious sword that is the only thing that can cut through mechon.   Maybe that's why you feel like X has lost it's mystery? Relative to Xenoblade, it's doesn't feel that magical. Xenoblade X feels more like a science fictional extension of our world."
