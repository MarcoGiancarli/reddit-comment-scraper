China,3e2qi9,Thelog0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:43:52 2015 UTC,You sew the nerve sheaths together and allow them to regrow naturally. It's very similar to an anastomoses.  Ideally the nerve endings are bathed in a calcium free saline solution to prevent early healing. This will accelerate the rate at which the nerves reattach. It can take up to a year though which means physical and occupational therapy are crucial to maintain flexibility and muscle mass as able.  Microsurgery and hand surgery are fun.

Here's a website from the UCLA about surface temperatures on the moon.  http://diviner.ucla.edu/science.html  Note that they also talk about ""cold traps"" which are areas of the moon that are perpetually cold due to being in constant shadow.  These areas are associated with crater floors at lunar poles, NOT specifically with the far-side of the moon."

China,3e2hz3,MreddicalS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:28 2015 UTC,"ok, since you arent a dick and curious this makes my dick hard talking about numbers.  the surface of the moon fuck it. just wiki'ing this shit so i dont waste time but i can go into greater detail if you aren't jerking me and i know this shit.  he Moon's axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is only 1.5424°,[107] much less than the 23.44° of Earth. Because of this, the Moon's solar illumination varies much less with season, and topographical details play a crucial role in seasonal effects.[108] From images taken by Clementine in 1994, it appears that four mountainous regions on the rim of Peary Crater at the Moon's north pole may remain illuminated for the entire lunar day, creating peaks of eternal light. No such regions exist at the south pole. Similarly, there are places that remain in permanent shadow at the bottoms of many polar craters,[81] and these dark craters are extremely cold: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter measured the lowest summer temperatures in craters at the southern pole at 35 K (−238 °C; −397 °F)[109] and just 26 K (−247 °C; −413 °F) close to the winter solstice in north polar Hermite Crater. This is the coldest temperature in the Solar System ever measured by a spacecraft, colder even than the surface of Pluto.[108] Average temperatures of the Moon's surface are reported, but temperatures of different areas will vary greatly depending upon whether a spot is in sunlight or in shadow.[110]  it's some of the coldest places colder than pluto in the solar system. why this is true is not really something wiki covers but more due to solar wind blowing heat away (i know that makes no sense but that's true and not in wiki). basically solar wind or gamma radiation mostly blowing shit away causing a vacuum and a vacuum is the coldest thing in the universe but there isn't an acutal vacuum to reach zero kelvin, but solar winds push that shit away since the moon rotates like an autist, hence the shit rotation.   if you aren't trolling me i can go further but if you don't know retarded deep math it won't make any sense"
China,3e2hz3,caucasianchinastrug,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:01 2015 UTC,"All that passage talked about was the extremes of temperature caused by differential illumination experienced.  It also pointed out that these areas are concentrated at the lunar poles, which is exactly what I cited before.   It doesn't talk anywhere about the far side of the moon being colder than the near side.  Even if the south pole is entirely on the far side of the moon, that would still be a small proportion of the far side that is ""cold trapped"".  It's pretty obvious that regardless of sides, any manned lunar surface missions must take place during lunar day - that much we can agree on.  However, a lunar base needn't be manned 24/7 and isn't necessarily a stupid idea (even if on the far side, for the reasons I've written above).  Also, what is this ""retarded deep math"" you're privy to?  I'm no math genius, but I'm no slouch and I've got friends with degrees in pure mathematics, astrophysics, etc. and if you're willing to outline more of your point here, I'll gladly follow it up with them."

China,3e2hnr,zerohalo,3,Tue Jul 21 18:00:03 2015 UTC,"I said this before and I will say this again. ""Rule of Law in China"" means 法家 Legalism.   Shi (Chinese: 勢; pinyin: shì; literally ""legitimacy, power or charisma""): Reflecting the preceding Zhou Dynasty's stability and means, this masculine character represents force or military strength, the appearances or influence of the ruler (""virtue"", or fame), and the state's situation or trend.[5] In the philosophy of Shen Dao and other realist philosophers, the Sovereign's forceful establishment of order and restraining hold on the state generates the stability necessary for any rule at all. The ruler exists to monopolize authority in-order to prevent its abuse by feudal magnates.[6] In the Book of Lord Shang, a strong inherited position supports even an ineffectual ruler, while a competent ruler without position effects nothing.[7] Shu (Chinese: 術; pinyin: shù; literally ""method, tactic or art""): Withdrawing from affairs except to survey the course of ministers, the ruler following the philosophy of Shen Buhai uses ""technique"", or special tactics or ""secrets"" to ensure that others do not gain control of the state, and obscures their motivations. Shen Buhai's technique did not use threatening or force, law, reward or penalty, all of which may be unsuitable for the exercise of one man.[8] Under the later Han Fei, obscuration of motivations translates into law enacted as the proposed policies of the ministers, then observed for outcome. By such means no can subvert the state through sycophancy toward the ruler, but may only try to advance by heeding orders and performing meritoriously. Fa (Chinese: 法; pinyin: fǎ; literally ""law or principle""): Fa Originally has a broader meaning of standards.[6] As far back as the Zhou, these would be the standards of the ruler,[9] though considering custom. The Book of Lord Shang emphasizes the use of laws to reward those who obey them and penalize accordingly those who do not, institutionalizing the standards set by the ruler and acting as a guarantor for actions taken. The ruler is advised to generally use, if not hide behind the legal system to control the state; if the law is applied effectively, even a weak ruler will be strong, effectively regenerating the preceding principles. In the development of administrative methodology, Han Fei credits Yang with Ding Fa(定法), or fixing the standards, which were to be written clearly, made public and applied throughout the state. All persons under the jurisdiction of the ruler were equal before the law, referred to as Yi Min(一民), or treating the people as one."

Although it seems like the easy solution, if you do get caught (and Chinese visa authorities are getting stricter and better at checking), the result is most likely that you will be kicked out of the country and barred from entering again for some good years.  Also on that note, please do not overstay your visa. My former roommate did and when he was trying to leave China, they detained him in the airport, took his passport and wouldn't give it back until he payed a huge fine.

But yes, if push comes to shove you can get a 30 day 0 entry L visa to allow you to exit the country, unless you fucked up in which case the police will give you their own deadline to get out.  This begins with the company canceling your paperwork, at which point YOU MUST GET A FUCKING RELEASE LETTER, YES THEY NEED TO PRODUCE ONE AND YES YOU CAN GET A COPY OF IT AND NO IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE STAMPED BY SAFEA - THEY CANNOT WITHHOLD THIS DOCUMENT BUT THEY CAN WRITE WHATEVER THEY LIKE ABOUT YOU ON IT.  You can, if your employer is super nice, get a ""Confirmation of Cancellation"" letter stamped by the local provincial or Municipal SAFEA office.  These documents will allow your employer, or rather you, to apply for the cancellation of your Residence Permit and the issue of a 30 day 0 entry L visa - the latter being conditional.    Details are going to complicate some of this advice so if you could oblige us with anything useful (being American is frankly neither here nor there - it's not like China cares what nationality you are when it issues your RP) it would be good."
China,3e28hn,lordnikkon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:06 2015 UTC,Your residence permit in your passport should never be cancelled. Any employer tells you to cancel it tell them to go fuck themselves. Your work permit belongs to them and gets cancelled. You residence permit is yours and is valid for 30 days after you leave your job and still valid if you get new employer. After 30 days if you have not found new employer your permit becomes invalid and you must leave but that is between you and the psb. It has nothing to do with your employer. The 30 day 0 entry L visa is for people voluntarily giving up their residence permit and planning to leave the country

But it is also a human right having a sustainable planet that is not overpopulated or lacking resources. It is also a human obligation to not overuse such resources.  China's one-child policy has served both China and the world well, and it should be implemented in India and most of Africa. Africa will see its population quadruple before the end of the century, while other areas of the world will stabilize and see a decline in population.  That said, China's one-child policy was never meant to be permanent, and it will in fact be replaced by a two-child policy within a year or two. China keeps the population control but adapts it to the ideal reproduction rate, the reason being an ageing demographic (much like Japan)."

How much make depends on how much you can charge a class and how many students you can get, or if you can find a flexible part-time job that pays well (probably not if you don't have ideas already).  Just pick a university you want to go to and can afford, or follow a good part-time evening job if you find one. My friends who work on the student visa pay 7000RMB to sign up for class and get the visa, just to give you an idea of what to expect.  How much Chinese can you speak already? Hustling for jobs is a lot easier if you speak some Chinese and are white. The other big consideration of having a group of people who know you teach and refer students to you, so if you already have that where you are now, you should consider staying put."

China,3e116u,TheDark1,3,Tue Jul 21 06:21:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of the condemnation you've been receiving, but I'm going to answer you helpfully anyway. Go to BLCU. It's a language university with students from 150 different countries so it's one of your better options anyway, but they also have an office in the main building that knowingly liaises between English speaking students and schools seeking teachers. If your English is unaccented enough to be passably native, you won't have any issues. They'll lie and say you're American. That said, they won't go in to bat for you legally. If you're caught, that's it.  When I was studying there, I knew of students who were self-funding their study this way while living better than I was on my scholarship money (I had the option to work as well, I guess, but didn't)."
China,3e116u,caucasianchinastrug,4,Tue Jul 21 08:19:56 2015 UTC,"Here's a better suggestion. Find a university gig, and once you've started, contact the Chinese department and arrange for one of the teachers to tutor you for a bit of pocket money, and all them to inquire about helping you take the hsk or other tests.   Basically nail down a visa that allows you to work first, that should be priority number one.  Edit: didn't see the part about you not being a native speaker. This plan might still be possible but you'll have to consider jobs in the sticks. Any province with 西 in the name will be your starting point."

I have a proper visa, i pay my taxes on everything i earn (fucking lots of taxes), a proper rental agreement for my apartment, a proper bank account, credit card etc etc etc.  I talk stupid in CCJ for fun, but actually I do everything by the book.    I give a shit if foreigners want to come here and do things illegally.  I had friend, who was living here for ten years illegally, running an illegal business, and in the end he blamed China for all his problems.   Actually more than half his issues stemmed from the fact that he was on the wrong visa, didn't have a proper business license and therefore he was constantly getting harassed or having to play nice with the people on the other end of his flimsy contracts.  But from his point of view it was China to blame.  Actually I think this country cut him a lot of slack, but he saw breaking the law as his right, and any issues that stemmed from it as unfair harassment.  Many people will get all shitty if they have illegal immigrants breaking laws in their own country but seem perfectly fine if they go and make a fake degree in order to teach of get a few thousand kuai to pretend to be an operations manager to help a Chinese company fool investors.  I think some of the rules are dumb, but I also think foreigners should hold themselves to the same standard they would at home."
China,3e116u,caucasianchinastrug,3,Tue Jul 21 08:33:07 2015 UTC,You have never done any side jobs outside of the job your residence permit is tied to? Clearly some people go overboard. If OP wants to come to China primarily to study Chinese and work on the side I think that's fine. Most of the people I've met here studying Chinese do a few hours of teaching on the side.

If OP speaks native English can probably pick up a bunch of cash jobs doing private lessons.    But I hope people who are evading taxes are not also criticizing China too much.

China,3e116u,ting_bu_dong,2,Tue Jul 21 12:14:13 2015 UTC,Your job pays very well and you have something big to lose. So it makes sense that you don't do anything illegal. This guy has 2000 USD and seems to be from a shittier country than China. I don't understand why it's a problem for him/her to teach a little on the side while primarily studying Chinese. He won't pay a few hundred RMB in taxes and it's illegal? Some laws are morally okay to break. And if you get caught tough luck. Hell I wouldn't be a Canadian citizen if my parents didn't break some laws in the shithole that their home country was at the time.  My shitty university job pays just over 6000 rmb a month. IMO I'd be extremely stupid to not do extra work and to follow the law to the letter as would OP in his/her case. I'd pay my taxes on the additional income but I'd get deported. And my university doesnt even deduct taxes off my salary. I asked for the tax forms a while back when I tried to wire money home.

How is it moral not to pay taxes?  What pays for roads, police, subways, bridges etc?  You are in a better position to pay taxes than most Chinese people, you use their infrastructure but you think it's OK not to pay for it?  That's not moral at all.  Also, please don't complain when it all unravels, or if the services and infrastructure are not good enough for you one day -- because you are contributing to China's problems by operating outside the law.

China,3dz7r5,Chapmeisterfunk,72,Mon Jul 20 18:54:23 2015 UTC,"The animosity you see on here is often projection by self-loathing foreigners in China who don't have any other qualifications, and who don't even like living in China. They feel bad about themselves and they want to drag everyone down to their level. They feel like pathetic victims, and so they pretend that all foreign teachers in China are a bunch of hopeless vagrants and migrant workers who have no other possible career paths.  As for foreign English teachers in China, the reaction is mixed. You won't get any great respect (if you do, they are just being polite), but people won't turn up their nose at you either. They're too busy living their own ordinary lives to care about your own ordinary life. Mostly they are curious to ask what your salary is, and then either say, ""Pffft... that's not so much,"" or, ""Not bad"" -- but those reactions will have no relationship whatsoever to how much money they actually make. Even if they make 2000 RMB per month, they may say, ""Oh, not so much,"" to someone making 6000 RMB.  There are some negative stereotypes of foreign teachers that are commonly known, like them being unprofessional, lazy, or not real teachers. They are not universally known, though, and there is no standard reaction to foreign teachers in China. If you're worried about negative stereotypes, you will just have to show people that you actually do care and that you have prepared your lessons well.  Personally, I gave up a middle class career job in the USA to come to China and work for a fraction of the salary. I did it because I found my previous job boring and I wanted to explore this crazy place. I don't regret it and I'm mostly happy with a quiet and simple life living in another culture, learning about the in's and out's of society. I also do it to buy myself free time to pursue projects and studies as I please.  Whatever choice you make, don't bother coming if you have thin skin. ;-)"
China,3dz7r5,jp599,23,Mon Jul 20 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"I want to add to this that especially in less developed parts of China, you will get tons of attention from curious Chinese people just for being a foreigner. People will ask you to take a picture with them. If you're a man who doesn't look hideous, girls may giggle and whisper about you, and say you're handsome. Even construction workers on scaffolding may stop what they're doing just to yell ""Hello!"" and wave to you. My friend even caused a bicyclist to crash into a car because he was so distracted by the rare foreigner. These people can be extraordinarily curious about you.  If you're in Shanghai or Beijing, though, few people will even notice you because foreigners are so common there. I have Chinese friends who have told me that these two cities especially are ""Not the real China."" They insist that their part of central China is a true example of Chinese culture. Although it seems a little absurd, I know what they mean.  If you want to experience traditional mainstream US culture, you should go to small town America (not NYC or LA). If you want to experience the quaint traditional culture in England, you should visit some little hamlets and relax in the local pubs. If you want to experience the real China, you have to go to the places where the culture is still overwhelmingly Chinese.  Of course, these less developed places are those that the self-loathing foreign teachers make fun of the most. The salaries there are low, the education levels are low, and they don't have the comforts of home. In villages where people make silk, they still give offerings to the Silk God and make folk art as they have for hundreds of years. If they can't explain some strange illness, they may bring in a shaman 巫 to drive out the evil spirit.  Some people on here say that China destroyed its old culture and that nothing is left. Nonsense. I went to a local museum with a girl from the countryside. In this museum there were old mock-ups of a house as it would have existed 100 years ago, including all the equipment for making silk. She explained every bit of it as if it were in her local village, and knew every designated seat for every family member.  A lot of culture does die out slowly, though. I met a young man around 20 who said that his grandfather was a Taoist who practiced meditation. His grandfather wanted to teach him some old methods of meditation, but his grandson always rejected the offers, instead insisting that he only believed in science. He wouldn't even respect his grandfather enough to pass on his old knowledge. That's how culture slowly dies. :-("

More so in Shanghai (where you can speak toneless Chinese or say ""take me to the Hyatt"" and actually get there).  Somewhat in Beijing, as you can go to Sanlitun and just use English most of the time.  But in both cities if you get out of the foreigner areas, it's pretty much the real China.   It's just that you have the choice to hang out in places where you can get tapas and french cheese and English speaking enclaves - and many people never leave that bubble."

They are not universally known, though, and there is no standard reaction to foreign teachers in China. If you're worried about negative stereotypes, you will just have to show people that you actually do care and that you have prepared your lessons well.  Personally, I gave up a middle class career job in the USA to come to China and work for a fraction of the salary. I did it because I found my previous job boring and I wanted to explore this crazy place. I don't regret it and I'm mostly happy with a quiet and simple life living in another culture, learning about the in's and out's of society. I also do it to buy myself free time to pursue projects and studies as I please.   God I'm so happy to hear that. I'm an English teacher in the States (a damn good one, according to my evals) and I want to teach in China some day. I won't be able to teach there until I'm almost 30 but it's a goal and the attitude I see is so often that people look down on the experience, like they're settling. I'm a good teacher and can do just fine in the States but I want to go there and enjoy China and be a good teacher there. It's refreshing to see someone with a positive experience because /r/China and /r/TEFL are pretty negative. Some day I hope to live in rural Yunnan or maybe a farming community with a small school where I part time farm.

For instance there is this hobo on TSR who openly boasts he does a bad job and will constantly undermine the local English teacher and even teaches children that racist slurs like the N word to describe black people is OK. He's also a sex pat.  You don't want to be that guy.  Also as with teaching anywhere else once you lose the spark and cease caring then it's time to maybe find something else to do."

Apartments, cars, and fancy dinners don't make for a truly meaningful or fulfilling life.  China can't run on materialism indefinitely into the future.

China,3dz7r5,zerohalo,4,Tue Jul 21 12:35:44 2015 UTC,"Crazy maybe depends on your reasons and your expectations. Teaching just about anything has its virtues because it puts your focus on helping other people understand what you want to communicate to them, which is a rewarding learning process for the teacher. But teaching in PRC (mainland China) is very difficult, IMO, because of the education system here, and its priorities. The money and opportunities are easy, but the frustration and confusion level are very high, along with other challenges."

Most institutions are carried by the chinese teachers, while the foreigners are just there for essentially a white face.    I heard the most complaints from my first teaching gig at a university.  I took chinese lessons from one of the Chinese teachers in the english department that I taught in, and he'd mentioned that some of my foreign co-workers didn't know anything about teaching (one of them didn't even know how to do basic tasks like accurately grade assignments, and it was always this Chinese Teacher's job to fix the foreigner's mistakes).  The foreigners do a fraction of the work and either get paid the same or more than their fellow Chinese staff who work full-time along with other duties, and the only qualification for most of the jobs is just to have a 4-year degree from a college.  Also most leave the job after or a year or so, so there isn't any real long term camaraderie or investment.  However it is how the system is, and since they can't really do much about it, they accept it and don't try to focus too much on the resentment.   After all the next year, there will be a new batch of foreign teachers."

The Chinese people I know have a positive attitude to their English teacher and actually want to learn as much as possible from them.    I think we just get a lot of shitty questions from people who don't have proper visas, qualifications, attitude, etc here... because the good people are just doing their thing and not asking questions.  Or we are discussing politics which is always a thorny issue, but really nothing to do with on the ground English classes.  Go and have a good time - if you are in your twenties it's a great experience.  If you are in your thirties or forties it could still be great.... but you need to be very clear on why you are here."

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with someone with proper degree in education, coming here to practice their profession. But it seem to me a large majority of english teachers here in china :       don't have the qualification to teach arent expert in english language either are looking for an exotic experience dont get a proper visa (often tourist or business visa, instead of a work visa) and they work illegally. dont take it too seriously, are or arent proffessional in their work, drink a lot, etc. Again, i dont want to generalize and say all teachers are like that, because i know some that are very proffessional. But the fact that getting a job teaching english in china is as easy as getting a toy in a cereal box, makes it that you get a lot of this type of people.    Hell, even the top post in /r/china this week recommend wannabe english teachers to get a fake degree to come work illegally, teaching english in china.   Its a cheap job that everyone can do. A lot of these people don't take seriously, move from one place to another, surfing on the money they get.

Foreign English teachers sometimes have a negative impression of foreign English teachers.  Teaching English abroad is a great way to experience more of the world.  It can even become a career if you love it and are good at it.  Usually, though, it's more of a ""gap year"" type thing."

Also a lot of the douchier expats I've met are american english teachers.  I'm american but not a huge fan of us on a global scale.  I find other people more friendly I guess.  Not trying to be too much of an asshole in saying that I just think being american maybe gives me some rights to criticize us.  Someone who has a plan for when they get home I won't judge so much.  So like gap year students, etc.  Or even if you're someone who always wanted to teach, this can be a great way to get experience.  Its just the international business majors and intl studies majors and things who are more here because they don't want to work at starbucks back home.

No one likes to see outsiders coming in and taking the best jobs, fucking the best girls. Most Chinese are actually really cool with foreign teachers, because they are often most approachable than professional expats, and many Chinese crave to know more about the outside world despite the efforts from their leadership to prevent so. The more educated folks understand that China isn't the center of the world and that it can't remain closed off from foreign influence indefinitely. They understand the benefits of being ""international"" a global citizen. Because the Confucian mind favors harmony, Chinese don't have many opportunities to see things from a different perspective, you can make a difference by being nice with the locals and expressing your opinions on various topics. Don't let some migrant workers or waiter at McDonald's give you a bad feel about every Chinese.

This is despite the teachers only having an online TEFL (mostly worthless), an unrelated degree, and no teaching experience. I myself, have an unrelated degree, but a CELTA and teaching experience. Battling against those who get bored of learning grammar, learning business English etc, is the hardest part of my job. Sometimes I simply have to talk enthusiastically about me, dating, family etc. This would be hard if I was worked to the bone. Performing tasks in a micro-managed, work-8-hours-a-day, desk jockey job does not require the same mental state as that of a teacher. You can argue that teachers in developed countries are worked to the bone, but I, and many (most) of them would say that it is wrong and counter-productive to the effectiveness of their teaching. Often at school I witnessed teachers setting tasks to students, then marking homework when they could have been monitoring students, for example."

I never said China doesn't fake their growth, but anyone who has lived in Asian countries aside from the tigers and China know that China is still relatively stable, violence free, and a hell of a lot more positive than Russia. This didn't happen because of some universal law that says if A do B, resulting in C. If it were so easy to replicate on the ground results, other countries like India, Pakistan, even Russia which lost decades worth of progress after democratization would have done it as well.

The benefits you're talking about arise because all the cheap labour, factories and infrastructure for those products exist in the same place - it makes things incredibly efficient (and so maybe cheaper, faster) but not particularly innovative in a classical sense.   On the other hand, it's nonsense to say Chinese people aren't or can't be creative/innovative. They're just so hugely focussed now on being cheap/high volume that the creative energy is spent trying to make things cheaper/faster rather than better and newer.

China's biggest obstacle towards innovation, and the strength of these other areas, is education. Chinese students are not encouraged to be creative and most never foster the skill. In turn, they aren't creative businessmen, they are simply willing and able to cut costs more than competitors. China focuses on output volume, not exceptional quality or innovative features.   This is not necessarily bad - someone needs to do this, and China is certainly good at doing things cheaply at acceptable quality, but they are currently punching well below their weight on innovation and are likely to continue to do so.   One last thing - the students and businessmen in China who do display exceptional creativity are often the first to emigrate to countries whose value systems more closely match their own - particularly the USA and Canada."

China,3e03tq,DarkSkyKnight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:30 2015 UTC,"As a note, you still haven't addressed the vast majority of my original post and have instead focused on one very minute semantic point.   You've also hand waved the first quote from my last comment saying you agree but failing to address the importance of that point. Instead, you complain that you have to defend yourself to other people in a way which isn't really relevant here.     Ranked by patent filings the Chinese are not only beneath the world leaders, they are also under performing most countries which they would be expected to match based on education levels, general literacy, per capita income and access to resources such as loans. China is no longer an impoverished Third World nation and comparison with those countries is simply masking China's inability to bring it's creativity up along with the wider economy. You bring up the last point yourself but again fail to acknowledge its importance.     People generally refer either to all types of innovation as a whole, or to radical innovation on its own - that is the unmarked form of the word. To say that China excels only in one type of innovation, and one which is further from the original use and form of the word, is not to say that China is an ""innovation powerhouse"". China is not even the best at doing things cheaply or efficiently (Vietnam for example has it beat here), which is what you are apparently saying makes it a ""powerhouse"". China does have a variety of factors which make it desirable to do business in at the moment but is becoming less friendly to western businesses and substantially less competitive compared to nearby countries as time moves on.   Plenty of industry professionals use ""innovation"" to speak categorically rather than specifying each and every time, and again to say something is a ""power"" is generally to say they are at least competitive in all aspects of a category like innovation. China at the moment and for the foreseeable future is a specialist.   For what it's worth (very little) my own experience in higher ed, management and business in China also totals more than a decade but a call to authority based on personal experience is of little use to either of us on reddit."

The non-racist corollary is that the lack of creativity is due to it's modern culture, which is defined by the collection of traditions, norms, values, and artifacts which make up modern Chinese culture.    This hypothesis is very difficult to objectively prove or disprove in part because ""creativity"" is difficult to define.  The best we can do is define this by measuring creative ""output"".  Such as:    number of fine artists (per capita) number of art gallery exhibits (per capita) number of movies X average critical review of movies number of novels published per year (per capita) number of patents based on original works (not patents of derivative technologies and technology transfers)   I would argue that creativity in problem solving is also part of creative thinking, and this should be exemplified by productivity (output/cost) of management-level employees  I will say that subjectively, after living in China for 10 years, Chinese managers seem to lack creative problem solving skills other than to cut corners.  I will say that a great deal of the artists I met make a living off of copying the works of others.

China,3dz5h1,jiangsen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:38:37 2015 UTC,"Monster Hunt (捉妖记), China's first homegrown live-action/CGI hybrid, took first place at both the Chinese box office and the international box office this weekend with $79.7 million and has grossed $107.4 million since opening on Thursday. That's the highest 3-day and 4-day opening ever for a local film.  In a close second at both the overseas and Chinese box office, superhero spoof Jianbing Man (煎饼侠) directed by online personality Da Peng (大鹏) grossed $68.7 million including midnight and preview screenings.  Homegrown 3D animation Monkey King: Hero Is Back (西游记之大圣归来) had an incredible second weekend, jumping 84% behind amazing word of mouth to $25.5 million and a 10-day total of $75 million. Monkey already became the Mainland's highest-grossing local animation on Thursday, surpassing this year's Bonnie Bears 2 ($47 million), and will pass Kung Fu Panda 2 ($99.3 million) sometime next weekend to become #1 on the all-time animation list.   Could somebody who watched any of these three give a review on if they are actually watchable.  Also: Here is Forever Young  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snBYFwc0UBY"

Thus most people took the habit to put it in a garbage bin next to the toilets instead, because no one wants to have to unclog a toilet. It's not a problem back home, my girlfriend's mind was blown when I told her that we can flush toilet paper without any risk of ever clogging the toilet in Europe."

I'm so glad you are going there.  I can't actually help you because I live in the U.S. now, but seriously Shenyang's got some of the sweetest, most sincere people. We might seem ghetto and ratchet sometimes but really we are down to earth and fun. I hope you like the city!  Also it's really dirty and I'm sorry.  Also also, Shenyang has amazing street food and also some of the finest North Korean cuisine to be found in the non-North Korean world, so take advantage of that.  You have to go to that part of that botanical garden that's a giant obstacle course. It is so much fun!   Middle street has amazing kebabs. Ask locals which ones though.  Laobian dumplings are super overrated.  Go to Wuai market in the morning one day so that you can be completely confused, overwhelmed and also amazed. You have to research which building to go to because otherwise you might end up in just floors after floors of toilets or something.   I know that the Sichuan kids think they have the best hot pot, but there is nothing better than hot pot with the Dongbei climate and personality so fuck them. Have hot pot in Shenyang.  Mt Qipan isn't actually good for skiing but the sledding is tons of fun. And it's a good hike away from the city if you need to forget about the pollution for just one day.  I'm getting too excited!

I haven't been to Shenyang but I know it's a bigger city, it's supposed to be way nicer than Changchun, more developed, and there's probably more foreigners. You can use WeChat to meet new people. To access Facebook, Twitter, etc. I recommend you use Astrill (www.getastrill.com). If you're young and have the chance, try meeting people at the University, even if you're not a student. Chinese are very eager to meet foreigners and will probably be delighted to have a conversation with you and add you on WeChat. Don't worry, you'll meet people who can speak English.

China,3dxe2j,caucasianchinastrug,7,Mon Jul 20 11:47:53 2015 UTC,"Excuse me, fellow China hand. I think you have made two small, but terrible errors.  Reshui (hot water) can be used to clean chopsticks AND bowls or cups. You would only have seen this if you went to a restaurant with NO foreigners. The trick is to poor the hot water from cup to bowl and then stare at it awkwardly until the waiter removes it from your sight. This will COMPLETELY remove everything harmful that was ever on, near, or even looked at the thing you are about to eat off/out of. In fact, if you are appropriately skilled in Gongfu (kungfu) you can even clean a plate this way, but that requires years minutes of training.  Of course, the most terrible error is suggesting tea is an acceptable replacement rather than the BEST option. After THOUSANDS of years of tea growing and harnessing a deep tea culture that round eyes could only dream of, Zhongguo (China), the home of tea, has given rise to not only the best drink imaginable, but also the best fluid for cleaning dish ware. It is good for healthy AND good for cleaning less than enthusiastically washed things you find in restaurants. Including, but not limited to: cups, bowls, kuaizi (chopsticks), plates, glasses, and your ego after the waiter goes, “Ooooh!” and then repeats exactly what you said because you’re tones are perfect, but he is secretly racist agains Caucasian Chinese."

China,3dx58n,justinchina,9,Mon Jul 20 07:07:03 2015 UTC,No other industry actually believes their own hype as much as tech nowadays. It says right on the FAQ they don't use measurable criteria. So of course hype comes into it as a big factor in these rankings.
China,3dx58n,txQuartz,5,Mon Jul 20 07:14:07 2015 UTC,"well, I think at least two of these top three Chinese guys are innovating, and are playing the game at a bigger scale, and more boldly than others...and I do think they have the opportunity to disrupt lots and lots of stuff in China...but Baidu is a complete mystery to me in this context..."
China,3dx58n,txQuartz,3,Mon Jul 20 07:17:08 2015 UTC,"These are supposed to be the ones making advances that benefit people, not just disrupting a market that is already unusually fragmented. For example, Xiaomi- even though their smart home ideas are a good start, they certainly don't deserve to be in the top half of the list for introducing scarcity as a demand generation point over the internet. As much as they like to trumpet their tech being unique, cellphones are commoditized and not really advancing much beyond the general forward march of computing as a whole.  Alibaba and Tencent are much more interesting for their ecosystem building activities, but I'm not sure about the placement so high for them either.  To be a cynic here, I figure since it's MIT the tech writers are probably at least somewhat composed of Mainland students hyping themselves up."
China,3dx58n,laolaoer,4,Mon Jul 20 07:23:19 2015 UTC,"I think you are grossly overestimating scarcity as a driver of demand for Xiaomi in China and abroad. It is rather a smart way to manage supply chain and keep costs down. In my eyes Xiaomi is a software company. They combine userfriendly software with mature hw from other suppliers and take advantage of the fact that gopro, samsung, apple and others have left huge margins in many segments. If you want to stay ahead you better be where the industry clock speed is faster, and that is not in hw. Its in apps and the internet of things. The fact that they dont care about profitting much on hw benefits the people who otherwise couldnt afford the tech.   Or at least that is another way to look at it."
China,3dx58n,zakazaw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:50:32 2015 UTC,"Another advantage Xiaomi exploit is to copy and steal marketing techniques, product design, and technology from other companies to use in their products.

This $50-80 is saved by Xiaomi by not operating this shopfronts, so what might have caused $370 to retail would now allow them to sell at $300 online."

China,3dx58n,zerohalo,3,Tue Jul 21 19:11:06 2015 UTC,"I previously worked in a Chinese Tech company, and have quite a few good friends in a couple companies in China, one being Tencent. I know it is anecdotal, but I would say that the majority of Chinese tech companies are not innovative, especially the big ones. They function within a protectionistic economic system, and are afforded the opportunity to implement already internationally vetted ideas. Sure, all of these companies will do well, but only because the Chinese government wants them to do well. They will continue to hack foreign companies, steal information through police organized raids, copy international brands, have exclusive rights to the largest national market in the world, and succeed.  I think Peter Thiel's explanation of Chinese innovation (vertical vs. horizontal innovation) is spot on."

Big companies are big companies. I agree, Baidu only exists because of protectionist policies, but at the end of the day, tencent is the BEST at what they do (we chat is a proper phenomenon), and Ali moves aggressively into adjacent spaces just like fb or Amazon. There is innovation there. If not for 10cent and Ali, everyone in china would still be paying for everything in cash online, and we would all still be using msn for chat..."

China,3dx58n,MOOC0WMOO,3,Mon Jul 20 21:19:59 2015 UTC,What's wrong with acknowledging that the Chinese can create innovative products and are doing so right now?
China,3dx58n,DarkSkyKnight,0,Mon Jul 20 12:14:24 2015 UTC,"Are you serious?  https://hbr.org/2014/03/why-china-cant-innovate  The top tech companies in China all innovate insofar as copying others are considered ""innovation"".   Consider the B2B portal Alibaba, which in 2001 was so shaky that we feared it would go bankrupt. But by creatively adapting foreign technologies to the needs of developing markets, Alibaba now serves 80 million customers in nearly 250 countries. The success of its auction website, Taobao, eventually forced eBay out of China. Or take Baidu, the Chinese search engine leader, which has grown massively in its home market with an offering that breaks no technological ground and does not challenge political orthodoxy. Having tailored its product, organization, and processes to the needs of China’s patchwork of regional markets, Baidu now has an 80% share of what has become the world’s largest search market.   Adapting Valley tech to Chinese standards is not what I call innovation."
China,3dx58n,DarkSkyKnight,5,Mon Jul 20 12:38:28 2015 UTC,"Almost all SV innovation is driven by adapting and improving upon existing ideas and placing it in a context that makes it relevant to the market it tries to address.  You make it sound as if Google's job is to ""challenge"" political orthodoxy, or that facebook for some reason wasn't built using existing concepts of social networks - I mean what has facebook brought to the marketplace in terms of innovation?   Look for example at sharing apps (e.g. Uber and Airbnb) - this apps are not created in vacuum, it requires a highly connected buyer and market of sellers that are tech savvy. Naturally US would be the first places this would develop due to the pre-existing infrastructure built in place and the existing technology that has been part of that society for a decade. Does this mean that for example Kuaidi Dache and Mayi cannot exist? Sharing Apps are actually one of the strongest examples of apps that need local presence - When in China, I would rather use Mayi.com than Airbnb because Airbnb is way more expensive for the same quality of housing. I prefer using Kuaidi than Uber because of the sheer number of taxis that actually use Kuaidi than Uber - then of course there is the entire concept that Visa and Mastercard are not strong in China!  At the end of the day, there are 2 forms of innovation that we can look at - evolutionary and disruptive. Almost all good innovation and things that we use today are not the disruptive sort.  Google is not the first search engine - it just does it better. Dropbox is not the first shared folder system - heck it's just a user friendly FTP client-server system. Facebook is like the no. 20th Social networking service.   If we laud these companies for their services, why do we not laud Alibaba which combines the better expects of Amazon and eBay and actually makes a net income (vs Amazon and eBay which are making net losses)?   We say Whatsapp is great and all - but it also never generated revenue and had to exit via Facebook. it's all based upon using the customer (you and me) as products for their end customers which are advertisers and businesses. This is like an Ouroborus - it's not sustainable.  Wechat at least is treating a customer as a customer - and it's strongest play which it is fighting with Alipay over is in Mobile Payment and the Mobile Wallet, which players outside of China have yet to perfect.  China is uniquely suited to solve the mobile payment problem due to inefficiencies in both their small unit of currency, as well as the backwardness of their credit system and the non-existance of POS devices in small merchants."

China,3dunv4,RH-MUP,26,Sun Jul 19 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the insider story! I'm not surprised, but I also agree with you that if you're going to be scammed, it feels good to be scammed so well for a relatively small amount of money. At least you can't blame yourself for falling for it!  Contrast that to a teacher I knew who fell for the Tea Ceremony scam in Shanghai, which every guidebook, website and travel site warns you about. I was shocked; I thought only uneducated, dumb young tourists fell for that."

But that's the thing that's bugging me the most! I didn't recognize the con immediately.  And somehow I'm impressed with their style.   The monetary loss isn't that big. But we are a small, family owned business and the overall costs and the lost time does still hurt.   That's the reason why I searched for a platform to warn others. Because these guys only target smaller companies, without a legal department, which probably would have spotted it earlier..."

Then later I met another couple who were also going to the tea ceremony, also with good English, also from Beijing. Were they just getting paid to go around telling their story and inviting laowai to some tea ceremony scam??? Or maybe there actually was a tea performance and I'm just too suspicious. :-P  I talked to some old Shanghainese guy, and he said all the scams for fake watches, bags, and currency exchange are run by the mafia."

But I don't think this will happen.   Therefore I'll probably add the name and all details shortly. I even think about creating an international black list.   What I've learned so far is, that many national organizations (like our chamber of commerce) have such a list. But it's either only accessible in the native language or not public. Which makes it difficult to find.   An English database, which combines the national lists, would have helped us avoid the scam altogether.   A better preparation would have done the same - I know. But as I stated earlier, we are a very small company with very limited resources and a lot of work to do. This sounds like an excuse and it is one. But it doesn't change the fact that it happened and it will again.   For the moment, I could give you the details via PM, ok?  Could you please tell me, where to find that info on the web?

You will still pay the maintenance fee but it will not be used for what it should, instead someone, probably the manager, will put the whole sum in their pocket.

China,3dunv4,TheDark1,3,Sun Jul 19 23:00:34 2015 UTC,This is a reminder.  Now tell us a story.
China,3dunv4,Jgj7861,8,Mon Jul 20 07:31:01 2015 UTC,"Okay.  So we were working on adding a new product (a mason jar) to our drinkware line.  We are a small shitty unorganized company owned by a fat jew but it works, and we make good money doing it.  You can checkout our drinkware brand website here, may or may not be up to date: http://www.greencanteen.us.com  Anyways, we were preparing a mason jar line for Customer W - Mexico.  We do a good amount of business with Them in mexico, because its less competitive but also lower volumes obviously.  The goal is to move the Customer W Mexico/Canada business and sell the same lines to Customer W - USA.  We currently only sell Customer W USA rope from our rope brand (BTW we were just awarded their entire rope line so if anyone knows any competent chinese people in Taian (shandong) please let me know!  We need QC people there.  So yea, we had a factory already lined up that quoted us a great price (about 5 cents cheaper than anyone else) so of course my boss wanted to go with that company.  They had also provided us about 80 pieces of samples and told me that they had previously passed a customer W social compliance audit.  This audit is a huge pain in the ass because the factories that can legit pass them are generally too expensive to meet Customer W's target prices.  Basically Customer W is the best and the worst customer in the world.  When I went to the suppliers SZ satellite office she confirmed that they had passed the customer W audit in 2010.  So, logically they should be able to pass it again if they reapply, right?  Nope.  Apparently they are doing construction on one plant so it cannot pass.  I say wtf, you told me this wasn't a problem and now we are 2 days away from confirming a 200,000 piece order from customer W.  She says don't worry we can produce and ship form our second plant which can pass no problem.  Fast forward one month.  Customer F USA is also interested in mason jars. This was in the works earlier which is how we were able to get such a low price on the jars for the first 200,000 pieces (because we were quoted at MOQ 1million).  They wanted to see a bunch of physical samples before confirming the order, but the order was basically ours.  So I contact the factory, tell them we need 16oz samples and 24oz samples, as in fluid ounces which is what the USA uses to measure a glass/bottles capacity.    I tell her this is urgent, we will pay the express shipping, sample fee if necessary, etc.  I call her everyday for 3 weeks to push her, I always just get, ""Very soon"" as a response.  Customer gets anxious cause they take so damn long but the samples finally arrive in the USA.    The 24oz mason jar was only 21 ounces.  My boss flips shit, the customer is pissed and we end up losing the order because A it took forever to get samples and B the dumb bitch sent the wrong size.    we cunt her out for it and she still claims that they are 24oz jars.  This is the best part, her explanation of how they were in fact 24oz jars:   Carol,  Thank you fo sending the samples. There is a MAJOR problem. The Large Mason Jars you sent are 20oz. Not 24oz. as the customer requested and was requested from your company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why????????????????? We waited Three week and send the wrong samples. This is a Major Pain in the ASS!!!!  Dear xxxxxxx,  Kindly check attached photos.  When the mason jar is empty, the weight is 460g and when fill up with water, weight is 1106g So the capacity of the big mason jar is around 23oz. We only have two size mason jars, so when you mention 24oz, we thought it's one because the capacity is very similar.  Pls check with customer whether this the mason jar is ok.  Carol   I am not sure what you are saying. 24 ounces is a Capacity, Not Weight. The large Mason  jars samples you sent hold 20 ounces of Liquid. Not 24.  ounces. I measured the capacity myself. We need to increase the capacity . Make it 24 ounces. I need you to confirm with an Engineer that the Cost will be the same for a 24 oz. size as you quoted to us. This customer has 10,000 stores, there cannot be any mistakes. Otherwise you have waisted everyones time. I need an answer today,  Dear xxxxxxx,  I also measure the capacity myself.  When empty,  weight is 460g, when fill up with water, weight is 1106g. So capacity is (1106-460)/28.5=22.67 ounces Pls make sure when you measure the capacity, the mason jar is fill up.  Is your customer very strict on the capacity and can not accept 1oz difference?  If so, we can make the mason jar a little bigger but need to open new mold and the cost will add around 0.03    Anyways, you get the idea.  Now I would like to think she's not dumb enough to confuse the fluid capacity of a drinking glass (she does work for a glass jar factory as a sales person) with the weight of a drinking glass, but hey you never know how stupid people are.  So now we lost the 2million piece order, but already confirmed the 200,000 piece order with Customer W Mexico.  Also this factory kindly informed us ""oh by the way theres no way we can pass that audit at either factory"".  WTF.  So now we are scrambling to find another factory, which isn't a huge deal except we have to either swallow the profit we would have made or somehow get the same price on a significantly lower quantity of jars, since we had already sent an official new item sheet and IRF sheet to Customer W, so were were committed to the price we offered them.  Miraculously I was able to talk another factory down almost 10 cents a piece and save the Customer W deal.  Its still a huge disappointment however because its such a small quantity, mostly just doing it for karma points.  So now I have to fly to qingdao and take a train to some shithole tier 88 city called zibo to check out the factory and get drunk with some rockies.    TLDR; Factory lied about audits, sent the wrong samples super late and lost us hundreds of thousands in potential profits.    EDIT: Removed details that apparently will get me hunted down and harmonized."

The complete behavior and procedure didn't deviate much from what we are used from other international companies.   But no - we'd never start producing anything for a new client without receiving a down payment. This, we've made clear very early in the first mails we exchanged. That was the reason why we didn't fear going further with the deal. We also wouldn't have paid any obscure fees (which is the most common scam).   We simply didn't thought, that someone would have gone to the lengths they did ONLY for the gifts they had us buy.   I'm still waiting on what still might come.

High speed rail was invented and perfected in Japan.    America went to the moon four decades ago -- with technology nowhere near what we have today.  Holding either of these things up as proof China has done anything remarkable is hilarious.  China did what Chinese did back in the 1860s... built thousands of miles worth of railroad tracks.  All the hard work, the real work, was done decades ago in Japan.

No, this is not the reason. People question the data because freight shipments, electricity production, trade data, housing data, investment data are ALL relatively weak compared the 7% GDP figure.   ""It is disappointing to learn that the Western media's displeasure with the GDP figures reveals the wish for slow growth in China.""  I don't think anyone really wants China to fail, us ""Westerners"" will lose a lot of money if China's economy tanks as well.  ""It is alluring to have economic statistics made on the government's will, which perhaps exists widely, but the Chinese government can resist this temptation.""  Is this the same way that it resists the temptation to censor information that it doesn't like? After all, the Chinese constitution provides for freedom of speech, and this doesn't stop them. Did they resist the temptation to cover up the magnitude of SARS? Sanlu milk scandal?   ""As faking a 7 percent figure takes more risk than releasing a lower but real one, China has no motives to forge the data""  There is little risk because the NBS doesn't publish its data or methodology.   ""Since the third and fourth quarter's growth will probably beat it, the yearly data will likely be higher than 7 percent.""  This makes their case worse."

China,3dwmmi,skullblasta,2,Mon Jul 20 04:56:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP, but here you go.  China Home Price Gains Spread as Large Cities Lead Recovery  Declines in China’s new-home prices were restricted to fewer than half of the cities monitored for the first time in 15 months as sales extended a rebound after authorities cut interest rates and eased property curbs.  Prices declined in 33 of the 70 cities in June from a month earlier, compared with 41 in May, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday. Twenty-seven recorded increases, seven more than in the previous month, as first-tier centers including Shenzhen and Shanghai led a rebound. Prices were unchanged in 10.  The recovery has been driven by four interest-rate cuts since November and increased incomes as Chinese equities surged about 150 percent in the year to mid-June. While about $3 trillion of that wealth evaporated in less than a month as stocks subsequently plunged 20 percent, demand from owner-occupiers is forecast to sustain sales and prices in the longer term.  The stock market rout won’t shake the fundamentals of the property market, Alan Jin, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Mizuho Securities Co., said ahead of the data. “Housing prices and volume are firmly on a recovery trajectory,” Jin said.  Bigger Increases  New-home prices in the southern business hub of Shenzhen, which is leading the residential rebound, rose 7.1 percent from May and 15.7 percent from a year earlier. Prices gained 1.3 percent in Beijing and 1.5 percent in Guangzhou, both the most in almost two years, and 2 percent in Shanghai.  The increases overshot May’s numbers in 20 cites, the statistics authority said in a statement released with the data. Less affluent cities including Shenyang and Guiyang reversed declines.  The strength of the real-estate recovery will depend largely on the stability of the stock market in the second half, Du Jinsong, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, said before the data release.  China eased mortgage policies and down-payment requirements for some homebuyers at the end of March, adding to easing measures since September to aid an industry that has been weighing on economic growth. While home sales jumped 13 percent in the first half of 2015, compared with a 9 percent decrease a year earlier, investment in property development slowed to 4.6 percent from 14.1 percent.  The trend of polarization is still evident among different cities,” the statistics bureau said in Saturday’s statement, adding that demand was robust in first-tier cities while smaller centers struggled.  Existing-home prices rose in 42 cities last month, compared with 37 in May, Saturday’s data showed. On a year-on-year basis, new-home prices still fell in 68 cities in June, compared with 69 in May.  Average new-home prices in 100 cities tracked by SouFun Holdings Ltd., which owns China’s biggest property website, rose 0.56 percent in June from the previous month.  Bloomberg, July 18, 2015.

It does not exist, either in the form of recruiters, or in people in general as you expect it, although it does exist in its native, inscrutable format, lol. Really, it does, but not just for the asking. You have to prove worthiness. Seriously, but it's not wax on, wax off, Master Po, it's something you don't know now, but might learn after years of living here, although the value of knowing is not often worth the effort, blah, blah   I don't want to just accept a job online and then move to China not knowing exactly what I am getting into   Contact schools directly and investigate each one by contacting current and past teachers. That is the only way I know of to get a good idea of how that particular job will be. Listen closely for any negative or vague comments and I would usually disqualify any jobs described as such.

China,3dxh8z,karmish_mafia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:03:17 2015 UTC,"With his collection of handcuffs and the siren on his car, inspector Lei looked every bit the Chinese policeman.  His wardrobe was filled with the black blazers of a crime-busting bobby and his office contained an armory of stun guns for subduing the outlaws he claimed to hunt.  But inspector Lei was not all he seemed.  When police raided his home in the city of Wuhan last week – acting on a tip-off from his disgruntled girlfriend – they found a fake police station that had been meticulously crafted by the fraudster cop.  Photographs published in a local newspaper showed a bust of Mao Zedong and a Chinese flag adorning the conman’s imitation interrogation room.  “With his disguise he was very deceptive,” Tang Hui, the real-life cop tasked with investigating the impersonator, was quoted as saying.   Lei reportedly used his alter ego as a moneymaking ruse. For at least two years, he sold falsified Public Security Bureau documents and warrants from his phony precinct.  Smelling a rat, friends of the fake officer’s girlfriend tried to warn her that her partner was bad news.  “Your boyfriend is not reliable,” one friend told her, according to the Chutian Metropolis Daily newspaper. “He always flirts with us online and is a total scoundrel.”  But Lei’s acting skills were apparently so convincing that those words of caution fell on deaf ears until last week when the woman – named only as Tingting – threatened to leave him.  Enraged, the counterfeit inspector vowed to post online a video of the couple having sex. Her response was to seek out a genuine officer of the law. Lei’s cover was blown.  During a search of his home-cum-interrogation centre, security officials uncovered a cache of forged documents, a GPS tracking device and a miniature surveillance camera, according to the newspaper report.  They also found a copy of The Story of the Stone, a classic work of 18th century Chinese literature that opens in a place known as the Land of Illusion.  “Truth becomes fiction when the fiction’s true,” the book’s opening line reads. “Real becomes not-real where the unreal’s real.”   Additional reporting by Luna Lin"
China,3dxeup,Australosaurus,2,Mon Jul 20 09:28:23 2015 UTC,"Chinese bullying in the South China Sea is simple ridiculous.  America and Japan have been transiting these waters and this airspace for over centuries.  Does China really expect anyone to take them seriously when they suddenly announce that these waters are inland lakes of China?  They are acting like an immature bully on a children's playground, stomping his foot, and demanding that all the kids get off his merry go round..."
China,3dxeup,corathus59,0,Mon Jul 20 15:04:34 2015 UTC,The South China Sea was also claimed by the Republic of China from 1912-1949 and is still claimed by the remnants of the ROC in Taiwan.   It seems people only have a problem with territorial claims if the one claiming it is the enemy.
China,3dxeup,jimmywutangclan,0,Mon Jul 20 22:52:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, Mao directly stated that he had no such claim, and the official maps of Mao, the Republic, and the Qing all show the area as international waters.  As late as 1979 the official maps of the CCP government show the waters as international.  This power grab isn't even about the resources under those waters.  It is a power grab by China to try and seize control of 60% of the world's shipping.  The rest of the world can only hope the CCP is having a bit of fun, because the US and Japan will never back down in the face of such aggression."
China,3dxra9,burtzev,4,Mon Jul 20 12:12:10 2015 UTC,"It all started going downhill after Mao retired and started running retirement homes in the Bahamas. Nixon told him it was a great place to settle down.  The great leap forwards/modernizations all failed and China needed to try something new.  Deng came along post purge and tried to build/innovate a market economy through speculative cat parables. It was controversial at the time as it went against Mao's tenets. He allowed people to own part of what they produced.  It worked well enough however to spark the then failed agrarian based economy into a controlled grass roots capitalistic market in the 80s.  People stopped producing token farm yields for local CCP bragging rights and began producing cheap products for US and European consumption.  This ""trinket"" economy slowly improved enough that Chinese banks started loaning money in larger and larger amounts to private industry in the 90s and Chinese people began exporting more and more products onto the global market. Jobs were being created and the stock market began to build a head of ""Running Dog Capitalist"" momentum.  Shanghai and Guangzhou see amazing growth. Cheap labor as always is in demand.  Party members, their families and anyone else with enough money to make a bribe start to do well. Billions are made but the CCP protects its currency and inflates its economic numbers to levels even Mao would have thought were bullshit.  A growing real estate bubble is rumored but the party scoffs at this as apartments in Beijing and Shanghai now cost as much as in NYC and London.  Banks are lending even more money as ghost towns are being built but are virtually empty. The economy keeps growing.  A new ""Chinese middle class"" is emerging in the big cities of people who are now buying the products that they used to export. The standard of living is improving in the cities. Not so much out in the countryside.    More money, more money, more money is being funneled out of China and into protected accounts. The ""prince-lings"" are being educated in western institutions and are buying homes at break neck speed.   Today - The real estate bubble looks like it is bursting. The stock market isn't doing so hot. The CCP moves to protect the market by placing restrictions on anyone who tries to sell stocks and by adding billions of RMB into the market.  What happens next? In all likelihood a real estate/stock market crash as people rush to prevent losing fortunes."

China,3du68d,pomegranate2012,4,Mon Jul 20 00:57:01 2015 UTC,"Right. The inner conflict of their persecution complex colours their understanding of the world around them.

An individual's cultural background can either increase or decrease the degree to which that individual is prone to this error. For instance, the enhanced sense of individualism in Western cultures leads people from those cultures to tend to emphasize the individual over situational factors, leading them to be (generally speaking) more prone to fundamental attribution error, compared to people from non-Western cultures, who tend to emphasize context and situational factors over the individual."

Han Xiao, a lawyer at the Beijing Jingrun law firm, says Uniqlo will face charges from 200,000 to 1 million yuan, and its license could be revoked for spreading pornography if it is indeed found to be a publicity stunt by the firm.

That's not too hard and I reckon most people who would have the self-discipline and intelligence to get a 'real' job in the western world and make comparable money would also be able to do this.  It really depends though; I some people aren't cut out for life in China and are total fuckups, but then in their own country they are successful and responsible.  The opposite is probably true too.  If you can take it to the next level, and you have the management skills to open your own school, and hire other teachers, then they are making 8k while you are keeping the other 20~k they bring into the school.  This is pretty hard and probably not too many people can pull it off because dealing with both the local government and with new Tims every year is obviously 2 major fucking headaches on top of dealing with students and parents.  If I wasn't going back to Canada this year, I'd probably at least have a try at going this route, but luckily my wife's online business already makes more than I'd make doing this anyway so going back to a first world country is really a no-brainer at this point."

China,3dtnwh,laowailaoshistyle,6,Sun Jul 19 21:23:12 2015 UTC,"Very cool post, OP! I'll add a couple of tips to newbies about the bank account.   Banks in China are different than where you're from, for example if you need to do anything but insert your ATM, you can sometimes only do it from the branch where you created the account. If you're in a larger city, I suggest some chats with other foreigners about the best branch that is within 30 minutes of where you live or work, perhaps one where they normally have English-speaking tellers and often do international wire transfers, and open your account there in preparation for future needs. I found the Bank of China branch in my city where they do this and it's a totally different experience from the small branch next to the uni where I unfortunately opened this account.  Another banking tip is that you show your passport to create the account and this passport number will change later when you renew the passport, which will require you to get a document from your embassy certifying the older and new passport numbers are the same person, then get it translated. Keep this in mind and retain your old passports. The USA embassy/consulate in China seems to do this by default now, they punch holes through the ID page of the old passport, but let you keep it.  Additionally, in China the ATM card and the bank acct. # are sometimes the same, which can create paperwork problems in certain banks, depending upon how clueless is the person you're speaking with. This is also a good reason to find the absolute best and most internationally-inclined branch for opening your account so that you don't continually receive random, contradictory answers to basic questions, like how to get a credit card or a statement. As per usual, the default answer in China is ""No,"" or whatever answer gets you out of their face.  One more thing to know is that it can take 10 days to 2 weeks to get an ATM card replaced, and some of the scams in China take advantage of your having your card on you when scammed. Personally, I don't usually carry my ATM card for fear of losing it or getting scammed, but is this safer than carrying around 1000-2000 RMB? Objectively, I think not. In fact, I changed this behavior to prefer carrying cash after my wallet was stolen on a bus and I was finally confident I knew enough to avoid it happening again. For most people, it makes perfect sense to carry the ATM card and use it for purchases in China like they do a debit card back home, just don't carry it with you if you are going to high risk areas or services, like KTV, special massahgee, etc.  Finally, the Chinese govt. does monitor direct payments from registered companies to foreigner bank accounts and if you don't have a work visa, they are likely to freeze your account. If you do have a work visa, they also know when you are paid by part-time work if they're a registered company and you may get stuck with a tax bill later you were unaware of, including a 50% late fee. For these reasons, if you are on a proper work visa and you take part-time work, learn how to pay the taxes or arrange non-standard payment. If not on a work visa, there is actually less, or perhaps no risk of this if the company is not registered. It is easy to be totally legit and on time with paying your Chinese income taxes, but in my experience, your employer will not help you learn how. Just some bank related things to keep in mind."

Something to add to your post...if and when you go to send money back home (wherever that may be), you need to have the tax document that shows you've paid taxes on your earnings.  And even with that, it will still probably take about 4 hours to send your money back...which will get quicker and quicker as time goes on.  No tax document?  Have a Chinese friend send the money back for you...they can change up to $50,000USD a year (I do this anyway, even though I have the tax documents simply because it's faster/easier)."

China,3dtnwh,caucasianchinastrug,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:28:00 2015 UTC,"A mentality I often see on r/China is ""See what I can do with this tiny amount of money"". It's a little strange.  OP mentioned sending home at least 5000 out of an 8k to 9k paycheck. You'll be able to do this on a 9k paycheck if you don't go out and do much. But putting together the gym and anything else to enjoy per month and it doesn't really happen.  If you cook all your own food, or eat at the cheapest places, rent a bedroom or rent a very small apartment and do little else but rest each month, you'll do fine with 2-3.5k.  In reality it's often a far nicer goal to just save 50% of what you're making. You'll burnout from work sometime down the line if you restrict yourself to a strict minimum whilst doing enough home tutoring to bank 5K (that is a lot more work than it looks)."
China,3dtnwh,mrminutehand,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:55:51 2015 UTC,"my fucking god. what shit life do you have to live on 4k a month? i know why most teachers don't stay because they come to a third world country and live a third world lifestyle. don't be poor, don't have the mindset to be the same as a streetsweeper and no offense to them but to all you fucking retards that live like morons"
China,3dtnwh,caucasianchinastrug,4,Mon Jul 20 04:02:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's pretty much the point I was making, without the insults.  OP says send home 60% of your salary, that leaves you with 3k to 4k. You either moonlight for your recreation money or you live according to those means, and both choices are okay if that's what you want.  But you don't save 5k from 8k and go to the gym, enrol in yoga classes or go drinking every other day. The numbers don't add up.  You moonlight, work 6-7 days per week and have OP's lifestyle, which will be extremely stressful. Or you moonlight a little for entertainment money, move to a normal paying job (10k to 13k) in your second year and live very comfortably."

China,3dtnwh,Hautamaki,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:03:25 2015 UTC,"3/4k a month is around about 100rmb a day. Fuck if you need to spend that much everyday i don't know what you do. yeah if you are going to bars everyday you would blow that and a shit ton more. You can easily live on that with no rent to pay, water and gas are pretty cheap and elec is decent. Home cook 1 slow pot which for 30-100rmb will get you six or seven dinners. Eat lunch out 15-20rmb for noodles ect. Oats for breakfast french press coffee. Big nights out with we chat contacts you can get free entry and free drinks at most venues. The gym is a one off payment, and yoga is generally included. Pick up games of ball happen everywhere. As do conservation classes."
China,3dtnwh,newbatthis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:26:56 2015 UTC,"That's not how calculating expenses works.  Firstly, you don't get gifted an apartment. You either get an apartment arranged for you or you get a housing allowance. Getting an apartment arranged for you means that you are still paying for that apartment out of the allowance that is automatically deducted. If you get Y8000 in the bank and your allowance is worth Y2000, your salary is Y10,000, not Y8000.  You don't calculate monthly expenses per day. A breakdown of what Y4000 may get you:  Y1200 rent (shared room. Y1800 to Y3000+ for your own place). Y500 total bills and fees (electricity, water, phone, bus transport, apartment management). Y1000 give or take on food. Easily gets higher when eating out. Y1000 (or more) on toiletries, taxis, nights out, monthly essential purchases, etc.  Lastly, tax will take a chunk out of your pay. Take away another Y300 to Y600+ for paychecks over Y9000.  For newbies coming to China, this is how your expenses will actually be. It's not a question of calculating how much you spend each day on food or alcohol."

China,3dtnwh,Hautamaki,3,Sun Jul 19 22:05:37 2015 UTC,"Depends entirely upon what you do with it.  If you take teaching seriously, you can open your own school within a couple of years and start making some very serious money.  If you just do the bare minimum, you'll have so much free time and energy that you can do virtually anything else you want to prepare for the next stage of your life.  It's only bad if you waste all that free time and energy doing nothing but drinking or shangwang or whatever."
China,3dtnwh,caucasianchinastrug,0,Mon Jul 20 01:33:08 2015 UTC,isn't teaching english mostly a gig for college students to do their first year out of college before going to grad school or something?
China,3dtnwh,Hautamaki,2,Mon Jul 20 02:06:13 2015 UTC,"Not really; to get a proper working visa you're supposed to have a bachelors plus 2 years full time working experience, so if you're fresh out of college the timing doesn't work out even if you wanted to lie about the experience.  Of course plenty of kids do it anyway but they mostly end up getting screwed around because the kind of place that will knowingly hire teachers illegally and forge documents to get them in the country isn't exactly the kind of the place where you can expect to be treated honestly and fairly.  Of course plenty of people also figure they know perfectly well what they are getting into and they can just be careful; basically they think they're going to outsmart the Chinese at their own game in their own homeland.  That very rarely actually happens.  These are of course the kind of teacher that get fucked over, work at shitty schools and do a shitty job because they never had the right skills and experience anyway and their motivation to learn and improve themselves goes out the window once they see that they are in a shitty school and being treated shitty and they have absolutely no recourse in any event; so they just do the very bare minimum to avoid being fined and thrown out of the country and spend most of the rest of the time just getting drunk, moaning about China, making dumb cliche jokes about 'Rainy', and so on.  These kinds of fuckups exist everywhere of course, but it's true that they make up a not insignificant proportion of English teachers in third world countries like China and that kind of reflects poorly on the actual professional teachers that have their lives together, are contributing to society, and making serious money to boot.  The thing is, the whiny, depressed, bored, etc 'teachers' also tend to be the most vocal and active in bars and online because they really have not much else going on in their lives and nothing else to do or to talk about, so people from the outside looking in get the impression that these losers represent the average, which is sort of unfortunate.  I tend not to let it bother me too much personally though; what do I care about what someone else thinks of my career?  I know how much I make; I know how much I enjoy it; I know how much I contribute to the world.  If someone else doesn't, that's their problem really.  I just don't want people who are thinking about getting into the career to have the wrong impression that it's just for jerkoffs; or that there's no future in it if you take it seriously."

You know, ones like you.  Too much time on their hands?"
China,3dtnwh,Jgj7861,2,Mon Jul 20 10:16:58 2015 UTC,"In my case it's true that I have more time on my hands in the summer when most students are on vacation.  Today I worked only 6 hours; during regular term time I work 10 hours most days; 6 on weekends.    But in any case you won't find me whining about unqualified teachers.  I don't recommend anyone come here without the correct qualifications because if you do then what you are really doing is bending over, spreading your buttcheeks, and saying 'open for business; low low prices!' to every asshole agent and recruiter and little shithole training center 'school' that just wants to make a quick buck off your dumb white face.

China,3dtnwh,PlasticbagPlasticBag,2,Mon Jul 20 10:37:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I debated going down this path in the past.  It's easier said than done though.  As I said in another post, if you go that route you're dealing with 3 sources of headaches instead of just one.  As a teacher, you only have to worry about your students/clients (aka students' parents).  If you own your own school you also have to worry about the local government, and you have to worry about all the other teachers.  So now instead of around 100-200 students that you're teaching yourself, if your school becomes moderately successful to make all your investment pay off, it's more like 500-2000 students/parents (depending where you are and what kind of school you are) that you  need to keep happy, plus at least 5 teachers and related support staff, plus the local cops, plus the foreign expert bureau and the public security bureau.  All those guys will want a taste too; unless you want to cough up enough scratch in advance to do everything 100% above-board, which is probably smartest but that's going to be a couple million rmb at least, which is a pretty serious commitment for a foreign country whose economy is built largely on sham numbers and whose government is not representative or accountable in any way.  People have done it and done well, but for me, when my wife's online business has started taking off, it's a much easier choice for us to head back to Canada and do that instead."

By Jonah M. Kessel on Publish Date July 19, 2015. Watch in Times Video » YANJIAO, China — Every morning at 5:30, Liu Desheng joins a dozen retirees waiting for the express bus to central Beijing from this small city in Hebei Province. They stand at the front of the line but never board, instead waiting as bus after bus pulls up, each picking up 50 people from the ever-lengthening line behind the retirees.  Around 6:30, their adult children arrive. The line, now snaking down the street, has become an hourlong wait. People cut in, and a shoving match breaks out. But the retirees have saved their children this ordeal. When the next bus pulls up, the young adults take their parents’ places at the head of the line and board first, settling into coveted seats for a 25-mile ride that can take up to three hours.  “There’s not much I can contribute to the family anymore,” Mr. Liu, 62, said as his son waved goodbye from a bus window. “He is exhausted every day, so if I can help him get a bit more rest, I’ll do it.”  Continue reading the main story  Outside the Forbidden City in Beijing. Officials are finalizing plans to move the municipal government to a site outside the city. The Liu family’s commuting habit is a small but telling part of a megacity in the making.  For decades,China’s government has tried to limit the size of Beijing, the capital, through draconian residency permits. Now, the government has embarked on an ambitious plan to make Beijing the center of a new supercity of 130 million people.  The planned megalopolis, a metropolitan area that would be about six times the size of New York’s, is meant to revamp northern China’s economy and become a laboratory for modern urban growth.  “The supercity is the vanguard of economic reform,” said Liu Gang, a professor at Nankai University in Tianjin who advises local governments on regional development. “It reflects the senior leadership’s views on the need for integration, innovation and environmental protection.”  The new region will link the research facilities and creative culture of Beijing with the economic muscle of the port city of Tianjin and the hinterlands of Hebei Province, forcing areas that have never cooperated to work together.  This month, the Beijing city government announced its part of the plan, vowing to move much of its bureaucracy, as well as factories and hospitals, to the hinterlands in an effort to offset the city’s strict residency limits, easing congestion, and to spread good-paying jobs into less-developed areas.  Jing-Jin-Ji, as the region is called (“Jing” for Beijing, “Jin” for Tianjin and “Ji,” the traditional name for Hebei Province), is meant to help the area catch up to China’s more prosperous economic belts: the Yangtze River Delta around Shanghai and Nanjing in central China, and the Pearl River Delta around Guangzhou and Shenzhen in southern China.  But the new supercity is intended to be different in scope and conception. It would be spread over 82,000 square miles, about the size of Kansas, and hold a population larger than a third of the United States. And unlike metro areas that have grown up organically, Jing-Jin-Ji would be a very deliberate creation. Its centerpiece: a huge expansion of high-speed rail to bring the major cities within an hour’s commute of each other.  But some of the new roads and rails are years from completion. For many people, the creation of the supercity so far has meant ever-longer commutes on gridlocked highways to the capital.  Encouraged by Hebei Province’s relatively open residency policies and inexpensive housing, people are flocking to suburbs like this one. Yanjiao has grown tenfold, to as many as 700,000 inhabitants, in a decade. But it remains a bedroom community for Beijing — a swath of apartment towers and restaurants with few services.  Many believe that the transportation woes will sort themselves out, given enough time and money. A subway and better light rail are planned to open in three to five years, and a new bridge over the Chaobai River to Beijing is under construction.  More worrying for many Yanjiao residents is the dearth of hospitals and schools.  “The services are bad,” said Zheng Linyun, who works in a sales company in Beijing and commutes about five hours a day. His 6-year-old son just started elementary school and has more than 65 children in his class. “All we see are more and more people coming here.”  On a bright summer morning, it is easy to see Yanjiao’s better side. Even though the cookie-cutter, 25-story housing blocks stretch dully into the horizon, shopping is plentiful, some streets are tree-lined, and the air is much cleaner than in Beijing.  But the city has no bus terminal, no cinemas and only two very small parks.  Photo  On a Sunday in March at one of the two parks in Yanjiao, China, residents found limited space. Credit Sim Chi Yin for The New York Times “The streets flood in the rain because there is no good drainage,” said Xia Zhiyan, a 42-year-old employee of a printing company. “They just built more and more apartments without the most basic facilities.”  Even by the cheek-by-jowl standards of Chinese public spaces, Yanjiao’s main park is hopelessly crowded. On a recent Sunday afternoon, in-line skaters bumped into each other at a strolling speed, kite lines crossed in the air, and older men politely jostled each other as they practiced calligraphy with water brushes on the sidewalk.  The lack of services reflects deeper challenges. With no property taxes, Chinese cities rely on public land sales for tax revenues. Municipalities are not allowed to keep other locally raised taxes, for fear that local leaders will misuse the proceeds.  So a bedroom community like Yanjiao has no way to pay for new schools, roads or enough bus service so that retirees do not have to stand in line on behalf of their children. Changing this would require restructuring how taxes are collected and distributed, an overhaul that is not on the table. Even though the supercity will consolidate affluent Beijing with tax-starved towns like Yanjiao, they will not share revenue.  Infrastructure has also lagged. Until recently, high-speed rail failed to connect many vital cities around Beijing, while many roads did not link up. Planning reports say the area has 18 “beheaded” highways — major arteries built in one of the three districts but not linked to others. One highway ends at a bridge over the mostly dried-out river dividing Yanjiao from Beijing, and has remained unfinished for years.  But several factors are making Jing-Jin-Ji a reality. The most immediate is President Xi Jinping, who laid out an ambitious plan for economic reform in 2013 and has endorsed the region’s integration.  The plan calls for eliminating the “beheaded highways” by 2020 and constructing a new subway line. In addition, the plan assigns specific economic roles to the cities: Beijing is to focus on culture and technology. Tianjin will become a research base for manufacturing. Hebei’s role is largely undefined, although the government recently released a catalog of minor industries, such as wholesale textile markets, to be transferred from Beijing to smaller cities.  Beijing is shifting much of its city administration to the Tongzhou suburb, ending the longstanding practice of putting government offices in the old imperial district.  The plan has started to drive up property prices in the suburbs, according to local news reports.  Improving the infrastructure, especially high-speed rail, will be critical. According to Zhang Gui, a professor at the Hebei University of Technology, Chinese planners used to follow a rule of thumb they learned from the West: All parts of an urban area should be within 60 miles of each other, or the average amount of highway that can be covered in an hour of driving. Beyond that, people cannot effectively commute.  High-speed rail, Professor Zhang said, has changed that equation. Chinese trains now easily hit 150 to 185 miles an hour, allowing the urban area to expand. A new line between Beijing and Tianjin cut travel times from three hours to 37 minutes. That train has become so crowded that a second track is being laid.  Now, high-speed rail is moving toward smaller cities. One line is opening this year between Beijing and Tangshan. Another is linking Beijing with Zhangjiakou, turning the mountain city into a recreational center for the new urban area, as well as a candidate to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.  “Speed replaces distance,” Professor Zhang said. “It has radically expanded the scope of what an economic area can be.”  Wang Jun, a historian of Beijing’s development, said creating the new supercity would require a complete overhaul of how governments operated, including instituting property taxes and allowing local governments to keep them. Only then can these towns become more than feeders to the capital.  “This is a huge project and is more complicated than roads and rail,” he said. “But if it can succeed, it will change the face of northern China.”"

China,3dvzrg,zakazaw,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:48:34 2015 UTC,"It sounds good but I'm sceptical about how'll it'll turn out. The emphasis is mostly about integrating powers and high-speed trains but there's little about actual resource-sharing and especially for Hebei. I have a feeling that more centralization might make things worse especially for the poorer areas because everything will have to be approved through a central body.  The writer points out there's nothing so far about revenue sharing so towns like Yanjiao won't be able to get funds for parks and other social services. Amusingly, a Yanjiao resident slams the lack of drains on town roads which leads to flooding during rain, which is also something I've seen in Beijing. Seriously, 5 minutes of rain causes massive puddles to form and curbs to be flooded.  As an aside, it seems flawed to call it a mega-city. It's basically forming a mega-province with two metropolises."

My buddy needed to transfer money from his (Chinese) wife's account to their joint account, so he went to the local branch with her bank card, ID card, certificate of marriage, his passport and a handwritten letter from her authorizing him to do so. The bank wanted to know nothing and even after calling her they wouldn't allow him to do the transfer. When he asked why, ""Foreigners can't do that."" When his wife needs to do an operation on his personal bank account (because he is not available), she just walks into the bank, says ""he is my husband"" and gains full access to transfer or withdraw money, close the account of do whatever she wants, no documents needed, only the account number. They entrust her because she is a fellow Zhongguoren. Now they are happy together, nice couple and stuff, but he was telling me how this infuriates him. China you suck."

A more realistic word that somewhat applies to the situation between communist china and communist russia is ""détente"".  For background purposes, it is worth considering that Sino-US relations between the Republic of China and the US have always been relatively good, as opposed to 中共美國 relations. It may be more complex than this, but in my understanding 中華民國（現在只在台灣）always has had good relations with the US, and the US never had particularly good relations with the communists - whether the Soviets or their allies, the Chinese Communists."

Their situation can't be changed by me, and there is no use complaining about every little issue.  As to whether the two countries can cooperate on some things, of course they can. But sometimes they will also compete and come into conflict with each other. That's just the way foreign policy goes.

I'm used to Chinese Americans who, generally speaking, have absolutely no sense of humour about their ethnic background whatsoever. To be be blunt, I find Chinese Americans have very little sense of humour about anything.  So, is this typical of CBAs? Is it because Australians are so laid back, while in America the fashion is to to belong to the most persecuted social group you can?"
China,3dtfid,candh,2,Sun Jul 19 12:57:35 2015 UTC,A lot of American humor is based on popular culture references.

It seems to depend on how much of a consumer of American film/television/music people are.  It gives people a common reference point.   When I am in China, I find it more effective to base efforts at humor on common interest in drinking, food, or sex.  Things that have universal understanding.  I find myself equally lost when it comes to Chinese humor based on Chinese cultural references.  That's just how humor is, you need a common ground."
China,3dtfid,sharp_scalpel,2,Sun Jul 19 14:41:20 2015 UTC,"This basically depends on whether or not they assimilate. In my experience, whether or not someone intends to stay, how good their English is, and how they are in a conversation all go hand in hand.

She may have a bad yeast infection, or some other issue.  I recommend an anonymous note. There is no way that you can possibly mention someone's unhealthy lady parts to them in a way that won't totally humiliate them and open you up to accusations of inappropriate behavior. At the same time, for her own long-term professional, social and physical well-being, she should know to fix this.  So a polite anonymous note suggesting she see a doctor, or at least try an OTC yeast infection treatment, seems the way to go."

I hope you are the highest ranking person in your office since you are white.  Unless you're a laowai loser english teacher like every other westerner here.  Honestly though you have very low chances of doing anything about this.  Mainlanders have a fucked up sense of smell.  Its like evolution or something so they don't throw up everytime they use a public restroom or walk past a stinky tofu stand on the street.  They don't know about basic hygiene.  The older generation literally went 40+ years without ever brushing their teeth.  I think they still don't brush there teeth enough.  Also deodorant is nearly impossible to find.  And 99% of chicks unless they are shanghainese don't shave their bush at all so I'm sure that doesn't help.  Also its like a million degrees here and IF they turn on the aircon it will be set at 29C  My advice, switch to a different english school or start your own illegal one out of your shittty apartment.

China,3dswn8,xigua22,2,Sun Jul 19 05:24:17 2015 UTC,A part of my job is full on translating between Mandarin only speakers and English only speakers. The ideal method I find is to translate as much relevant shit as you can but summarizing the needless banter. A lot of times there's a lot of side conversation that happens that's just fluff and really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things so summarize in that scenario. another key thing is to be sure the Mandarin speakers are equally informed as the English speakers. If both parties are comfortable as a result then that lessens your load because people try to communicate on their own once trust is established.
China,3dswn8,robomonkeyscat,4,Sun Jul 19 06:20:02 2015 UTC,"The real trick is not to translate, but to teach the other foreigners the words and how to use them they need to know as you encounter them.

China,3dswn8,Gravys,2,Sun Jul 19 03:49:31 2015 UTC,"3 years ago I landed in China and my friend (who'd been there six) met me at the airport. When he was sober, he was pretty good at helping me get accustomed. He didn't translate slavishly, rather he just asked necessary questions then he'd provide the occasional summary. ""I've just ordered beer and hotpot. She wanted to know if we can eat chili.""  The only awkward times came when we were semi-separated, notably in the KTV room where he had his KTV girl and I had mine. He was doing his best to convince his girl to go home with him so didn't want to spend his time playing translator for me. As a result I was left there looking stupid.  On the upside, many Chinese speak a few words of English and they're keen to try them out. That broke the ice and the my own desire to improve my communication skills had me studying and asking questions (e.g. How do I say ""You're very pretty."" and how do I ask ""Do you want a mixed baby?"")"

It's much faster if the Chinese side at least understands some English (they probably studied it for many years) and then they can hear the answers and just speak in Chinese, you translate to English, your friends answer in English, they answer in Chinese, etc.  If it's two groups of friends, good to do some stuff like toasts at dinner where you translate some toasts to both sides.  This can help break the ice a bit especially if drinking.  To some degree you'll end up doing all the ordering and stuff in Chinese in restaurants (and you'll have to read everything if there's no English or pictures) but they might be able to handle buying drinks and water bottles and stuff if you teach them a little, and teach them to point and order from picture menus, then your load is more trying to make sure there are no misunderstandings (it shocks me how many waiters cannot see where your finger is pointing).

Some of my friends were going on and on about how he was going to ""save China,"" but I told them that one man can't change the situation he's inherited and he isn't this liberal figure that fights for the little man like he portrays himself. Plus, his ""corruption campaign"" is a thinly veiled party purge, which my friends didn't buy at first (but do now).

China,3dq3sx,AgentCC,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:08:29 2015 UTC,"this is a tough case for ""the greater good"". i can't imagine being a leader of a billion fucking people and a country that changes so much on a yearly basis.   he has to have a strong stance and civil rights could easily cause unrest and that's his main job to keep 1.4 billion people content with their current lifestyle.   i am pro censorship, pro arresting people that cause a stir even if its for morally good reasons that they are fighting for, a billion people is not an easy task to manage. fuck that. mr hu and mr. 11 don't have an easy job but they do a pretty damn good job keeping ""peace"" for so many people"
China,3dq3sx,caucasianchinastrug,8,Sat Jul 18 16:58:17 2015 UTC,"No doubt that Xi has a difficult job but I'm of the opinion that he's fighting a losing battle by fighting against civil rights and will actually cause more harm to his country than good.  What you see as stability, I see as rigidity and resistance to progress.   You cannot arrest ideas, and by arresting the lawyers you're actually taking away peaceful methods for change that leaves disgruntled Chinese with only extralegal methods of inducing change in the form of riots and such."

The list goes on. The bigger and the more numerous the tasks are in managing a state, the fewer moral and legal resources can be used.  Can China be a better nation than it is now? Absolutely.

China,3dq3sx,CheeriosRDonutSeeds,12,Sat Jul 18 19:01:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know running a country is hard. But don't take me for an idealist, I am very much a pragmatist. The ""stability"" China apologists rabidly defend is a false and empty notion.   The Kim family of North Korea is as secure as it ever has been. North Korea is as ""peaceful"" as it ever was in its history. But they have long since lost the hope of keeping up with South Korea in development and prosperity. And North Korea was winning that race up until the early 70s. Yes, South Korea has seemed less peaceful at times, with coups, student protests, contentious politics and democracy. But that was South Korea adapting and improving. North Korea never adapted, stubbornly pursuing a policy of stability.  Consider that there is no rich country -- no high income nation -- in the world that hasn't embraced liberal economic and political institutions. Zero. Sure there are countries that are democracies that are poor... democracy, rule of law and a liberalized economy are not sufficient conditions. But there is not one country that has become rich without embracing those features. That should tell you something.  Indeed, China's growth miracle was only possible by moving in the liberal direction. Maoist policies would have resulted in more of the Soviet economy, and China would have become like Russia. Deng moved the country (ever so slightly) in the direction of free markets and less retribution against the population for straying from ideological purity. And that made all the difference.   You may be saying, these are all economic reforms, not political. But they are related. Political liberalization is just a free market for ideas. People need to be able to analyze and criticize as they see fit in order for the country to have the information it needs to make the right decisions. If China were less sensitive to criticism of their massive 2009 stimulus, if people felt more comfortable discussing the systematic risk of overcapacity, maybe we wouldn't be in the mess we are in today. The government induces a very pervasive fragility when it clamps down on the people. A fragility of economy and society.  The path of progress is difficult and rocky. But let's not kid ourselves, stubbornly staying put is a death sentence for China or any country. The Communist Party is living on borrowed time, it must change or doom China to a very harsh future."
China,3dq3sx,zhongdama,2,Sun Jul 19 00:16:23 2015 UTC,"Excellent post. Not a single rich country hasn't embraced liberal economic and political institutions.  I'd also like to add that ""stability,"" which is often used by the party and pro-China apologists to justify CCP rule, is actually just code for keeping power. The unfortunate thing is that some Chinese people actually believe that stability is something only the CCP can grant, which means perpetual CCP rule."
China,3dq3sx,zakazaw,6,Sun Jul 19 10:01:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think the North Korean comparison holds up. Kim Jong Un is currently writing off military advisors in order to quell the possibility of a coup d'etat. There is a false dichotomy of development and stability presented here which I disagree with. Development follows stability, and an unstable country simply cannot develop.  I'm hearing your idea as the ideological continuation of Deng Xiaopeng's policies: In addition to economic growth via liberalization, there should also be political growth via intellectual liberalization. As a Hong Konger, I wholeheartedly agree, and I think China is slowly getting there. Your view of China's political institution as a conservative, unmovable bulwark is incorrect in the fact that the Chinese autocratic policy making process is one of the swiftest political processes that the modern world has to offer. Contrast that to India, where population and corruption is also rampant, but the so-called democratic government simply are too bogged down in their various interests to enact reform.   For example, looking at Xi's political reforms against corruption is a small but vital step. It allows for a shift of cultural paradigm in the Chinese ruling class, one that will manifest itself in the coming decades. It is by all means a strong-armed tactic, even in the eyes of those within the government. But as I've said before, development follows stability, and laying the foundations for stability via autocracy is the most efficient way to cultivate development."
China,3dq3sx,CheeriosRDonutSeeds,5,Sun Jul 19 00:47:02 2015 UTC,"India and China are way too far apart for a fair comparison. That's why I compared North Korea to South Korea, not to China. Compare NK and SK, East and West Germany, Panama and Colombia, India to Pakistan or Bangladesh, etc. Apples to apples. In every case you see the more liberal-democratic, the more successful.   Development indeed follows stability at some very basic level, that's why Iraq is not going to develop despite democratic reforms. However, once there is a sufficient stability, liberalization is key. China is not unstable. People who claim that are paranoid apologists of the current government. Indeed, the elements making China slightly unstable are due to the Communist Party and its history: gender imbalance, environmental degradation, grievances with low accountability, no rule of law, etc. The solution to the problem is not more of the same bullshit."

Maybe something north of $30K per capita PPP? Obviously one way to get rich is to have a lot of cheap oil and a relatively small population, so I would exclude nations like the Gulf States, Brunei and Norway... If you don't want to, that's fine. It doesn't matter for my argument, China can't make it to the big leagues on oil wealth anyways.   What are you trying to say? Russia isnt communist anymore.   I am trying to say that without reforms in the direction of a freer economy and less authoritarianism, China would not have grown as it did. USSR growth rates in the late 40s through mid 60s were double those of the US. But by 1980, even Deng could see the Soviet system had plateaued and started making reforms. The former USSR made no such transition and then collapsed. After the dissolution, Russia liberalized (somewhat) and prospered in the 2000s, though seems to be backsliding this decade."

After the dissolution, Russia liberalized (somewhat) and prospered in the 2000s   It actually did try to make such a transition and it failed. Deng was smart enough not to move so quickly.

But no one feels their liberties threatened when they go there.   It actually did try to make such a transition and it failed.   Whatever, the country was bankrupt. It's hard to make a case that the reforms had much to do with it. The USSR needed Western creditors to bail them out, and the West (for vindictive reasons probably) said no, and it was finished.

I have many female Chinese friends, so its not like I totally hate them or anything.

Others had their offices raided, or were summoned to “take tea” at the local police station—a euphemism for being interrogated. According to Amnesty International, around 120 lawyers, as well as more than 50 support staff, family members and activists, have been rounded up across the country since the pre-dawn hours of July 9th. Many have been released, but as The Economist went to press at least 31 were still missing or were believed to remain in custody.  The round-up has been remarkable for its speed, geographic extent and the number of people targeted. Teng Biao, a Chinese lawyer and activist currently in America, says it includes nearly all of China’s civil-rights lawyers. They are a harassed lot at the best of times, but this is the most concerted police action against them since such lawyers began to emerge in the early 2000s as defenders of the legal rights of ordinary people in cases against the state. In the past few days state media have vilified them, describing them as rabble-rousers seeking “celebrity and money”.  The police have focused particular attention on Fengrui, a law firm in Beijing. It was set up in 2007 and is known for defending dissidents as well as suing on behalf of people forcibly evicted from their homes and victims of miscarried justice. The police have accused some Fengrui staff of being part of a “major criminal gang” whose members stirred up discontent about the government in more than 40 incidents of “public disorder” in the past three years. They cite the case of a “lawful” police shooting in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang in May, which they accuse Fengrui’s lawyers of “hyping up” through social media and by organising a demonstration against it. Wang Yu, the first lawyer to disappear (her husband and 16-year-old son were taken too), worked on this case.  Civil-rights lawyers in China often publicise disputes because they do not trust the legal system. The judiciary is not independent, judges are often beholden to local interests and the law is not applied even-handedly. Popular sentiment can help to sway court decisions. Since taking office in 2012 Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has stressed the need for the “rule of law”, but has made it clear that he means something different: shoring up the party’s control, not holding it to account. Several years ago the party tolerated civil-rights lawyers. Now it treats them as seditious. Some of those detained recently were warned not to get involved in “sensitive” cases. Veiled threats were made to their families.  The sweep follows a particularly dispiriting few months for civil rights in China. Earlier this year five feminists were held for five weeks for campaigning against sexual harassment on public transport (several of their lawyers, who include Ms Wang, are among those interrogated in recent days).

When the nazis started to persecute the Jews, they didn't just round them all up and send them to the ghettoes and camps one day. They started by making it illegal for Jews to work in the media and the law.    Once they removed their public and civic voices, they removed the Jews from government bureaucracy. Subsequent steps outlawed Jews from owning businesses, teaching, and any other positions that allowed them to possess wealth and/or influence.   Once that was complete, they were confined to the ghettoes and eventually the camps.

Other than that, who knows why it didn't make the cut. It's not a transparent process.  Usually in the month before a movie's worldwide release, you either check IMDB or a Chinese website like Mtime to find out if it'll come out on the Mainland. But it's not ironclad, and there have been times the movie is delayed release or just cut altogether by the Film Board.   At Mtime, if it'll come out in Chinese theaters, it'll say the [Chinese date]中国上映. Sadly, the Ant Man Mtime page says 美国上映, which implies no release in China. The IMDB page confirms this: Hong Kong has it, but not the mainland.  Sometimes movies come out in China months after the entire world has seen it. It's quite bizarre but the Hollywood studios are desperate to get some of the Chinese upper middle class market. The vast majority of Chinese still watch pirated films, but they don't matter since they can't afford to go cinema anyway."

China,3dq3m6,ogami_ito_sugoi_jiba,9,Sun Jul 19 00:31:28 2015 UTC,"by Josh Chin  China is in denial about its alienation of Taiwan and needs to rethink its approach to the island, the top official in charge of managing Taipei’s relationship with Beijing said on Friday.  “Somehow they need to think of how to do some soul-searching,” said Andrew Hsia, the head of Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council. He said that his counterparts in Beijing seemed “puzzled” by growing antipathy among Taiwanese people toward China.  The comments from Mr. Hsia, delivered in a conversation with The Wall Street Journal in New York, show how mainland China’s declining image in Taiwan has complicated relations ahead of the island’s presidential elections, whose outcome could frustrate Beijing’s desire for closer ties.  Relations between Taiwan and China have long been fraught; the two sides split in 1949 following a civil war. The past seven years, Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou and his ruling Nationalist Party have worked to reduce tensions in a bid to boost the island’s economy. But stagnating wages and growing income inequality have become front-burner issues for many in Taiwan, and some see trade and commercial dealings the mainland as contributing to those problems. They question the concessions Taipei is making to Beijing, which has refused to disavow force in bringing about eventual reunification.  Student protesters opposed to a trade pact with Beijing took over Taiwan’s main legislative chamber last year. The Nationalist Party–also known as the Kuomintang–took a beating in local elections in December, in part because of disillusionment with its China policy.  A poll conducted by National Chengchi University shortly after the elections showed 23% of Taiwanese people supported independence for the island, the highest level since polling began in 1992. The number of people identifying themselves solely as Taiwanese, as opposed to Chinese, also set at new high at 60.6%.  Despite that, Mr. Hsia said, Beijing has continued to act in ways that irritate people and officials in Taiwan. He cited provisions in China’s new National Security Law requiring Taiwanese people to protect the country’s sovereignty, which he described as “not acceptable,” and entry permit cards Beijing began issuing to Taiwan residents without consulting or notifying the Taiwanese government.  He also mentioned Taiwanese violinist Tseng Yu-chien, who was identified by organizers as being from “Taipei, China” rather than Taiwan after he won the silver medal at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Russia earlier this month.  “We were told this was because of pressure coming from the [Chinese] embassy,” Mr. Hsia said.  ”I can give you example after example.”  The Chinese Embassy in Washington D.C. and the Chinese consulate in New York City didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.  Mr. Hsia said Chinese officials were confused when he mentioned the increasingly negative perceptions of China in Taiwan to his counterpart, Chinese Minister of Taiwan Affairs Zhang Zhijun, during a meeting in May.  “Since then, we got word that they were not happy with the description, but this is the truth, this is the reality,” he said.  The KMT is expected on Sunday to confirm Hung Hsiu-chu, an outspoken former teacher, as its candidate to take on Tsai Ying-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party in presidential elections next fall. Ms. Tsai, who is widely favored to win in polls, has said she favors maintaining the “status quo” with China. It’s a position shared by most Taiwanese, according to government polls.  The Taiwan-China relationship is better than it has been throughout most of its history, Mr. Hsia said. But, borrowing a page from Beijing’s own diplomatic phrase book, he said it needs to be “much more sensitive to the feelings of the Taiwanese people.”  Political strife in Hong Kong had made matters worse, he said. Last month, legislators there voted down a Beijing-backed proposal that would have allowed residents in the Chinese territory to directly elect the city’s top official but only from a list of preapproved candidates. The proposal had earlier sparked massive street protests that were closely followed in Taiwan.  “If you truly wanted to win the hearts and minds of the Taiwanese people, make a good example in Hong Kong. Obviously it’s not helping,” he said."

China,3dpiqp,upads,10,Sat Jul 18 13:16:20 2015 UTC,"Those photos really illustrate how tough it was for normal people living through the war. The KMT had to make some hard decisions about how to fight the Japanese, and those decisions often went against the welfare of Chinese people caught in the middle. Henan basically turned on KMT (which complicates the whole glorious, united war against Japan story).  A report from a KMT general that appears in Rana Mitter's Forgotten Ally: Chinas World War II, 1937-1945   ""During this campaign, the unexpected phenomenon was that the people of the mountains in western Henan attacked our troops, taking guns, bullets, and explosives, and even high-powered mortars and radio equipment . .  . They surrounded our troops and killed our officers. We heard this pretty often. The heads of the villages and baojia (village mutual-responsibility groups) just ran away. At the same time, they took away our stored grain, leaving their houses and fields empty, which meant that our officers and soldiers had no food for many days."""
China,3dpiqp,MoonshineGraham,4,Sat Jul 18 06:12:21 2015 UTC,Also wasn't uncommon for troops to show up in a village and do whatever the hell they pleased.
China,3dpiqp,iwazaruu,3,Sat Jul 18 07:08:48 2015 UTC,Exactly. The (understandable) animosity between Chinese soldiers and Chinese citizenry is probably an underreported aspect of the war.

Under the Japanese rule, the literacy rate of Taiwan went somewhere from 5% to 80%, along with many other efforts put out by the Japanese like the construction of innumerable infrastructures.   The Taiwan of 1943 was THE most prosperous economic entity of the entire Asia. KMT messed that record up good well within 10 years.

The Big Mac index only considers the cost of materials that goes into food. One should also consider the price of rents, utilities, and wages paid to workers. Also a McDonald franchise can set its own prices that is best suited for it's market environment... the environment is not as competitive as say in the rice market.  As a (failed) economist, I think the Big Mac index is an light-hearted measure on purchasing power parity. It has some interesting results, but a result that I won't take it too seriously."

China,3dp5ix,okuulover,42,Sat Jul 18 02:49:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on the ""quality"" of the barbershop.  The place I frequent is run by two guys who cut hair from 9am-10/11pm, along with an apprentice (who washes customer's hair) that gets training from the shop's owner during down-time.   Obviously pretty crowded during the weekend or right after work, so be prepared to wait for a half an hour or so. Normal haircuts for men usually range from 20-30rmb, whereas the whole sha-bang for women range from 100-500, depending on what sort of treatment they ask for.  This is a pretty typical, small barbershop   Now I'm sure you've seen the huge, Toni & Guy sort of places, which I would classify as a salon. These places are obviously more expensive since they have 20+ kids on staff and their rent is usually much higher than smaller places.  If you like thumping club music blaring during your haircut experience, then try hitting up one of these places I guess.  EDIT: WELL FUCK THAT WENT WAY OVER MY HEAD."

Find barber shop, very easy because outside and inside you will see many metrosexual dudes with gay haircuts Walk in, DO NOT get scared as multiple people yell HUANGLINGGUANLIAAAA at you, as this will only show weakness. Tell them you need to jian the tofa. Your hair will get washed by a Rainy for an unnecessarily long time while she asks you stupud questions. Blurt out random answers, maybe one of them might be right (没有女朋友，二十八岁，当然中国的，四年，外教老师，听不懂）. After this she will lead you to a chair. Make sure to pic the gayest looking dude and not Rocky. Repeat number 5 when he asks you questions. Try not to kill yourself from the shitty music playing inside, again dont show weakness. ”你很帅” from mulitple Rockies When done go pay.

In fact it's so unusual here that I hate it when I go and it's some anorexic looking Rocky that's going to wash my hair.  Though, the last time it was a Rainy, but she kept bashing my head into the sink...dumbass."
China,3dp5ix,Sasselhoff,25,Sun Jul 19 05:39:36 2015 UTC,"Ah.  Finally.  Look no further... I am an expert in this topic.  Listen closely and learn how to China like a boss.  First of all, go to Japan and get a massage girl there... one with big, big boobs.  Because that is what life is about... smothering your worries and troubles between heaving boobies.  Then go back to China because you are an idiot.  The following is about China.  There are some as u/Louis-R-Backhome described below which are just low-end brothels.  I would stay away from those unless the girl happens to be at least 30 years old, not ugly, and has big boobies.  I've done that type of place, but it's really sketchy.  Girls often look sad and the whole thing is dirty.  Probably most massage parlors offer happy-ending massages.  Typically they will give you a massage, then they will play with parts of your body, then they will give you a new type of massage.  If you like the regular massage and just want a release (with a fully clothed girl) then go to these.   ""Barbershops"" used to be all over the place.  Now many are disguised as legit massage parlors with girls who wear uniforms... look for sexier uniforms though.  The now not-as-prevalent small, red (or blue) light barber shops are often dirty, with really un-interested girls.  But some are good... you don't know until you survey them.  In many places, a girl starts taking off your pants and warming you up, then another girl comes in and they try to upsell you to have two girls.  I don't like spending the extra money, unless the other girl has huge boobs.  As this is China and they never have huge boobs, I always decline.  If they push this, I have to threaten to leave and not pay.  If the girls seem to give you a higher price because you are a foreigner, despite the fact that you can speak Chinese and you listen to what they say, then I leave right away... you want to get service from an honest sex worker, of course.  For massage parlor type place (ie. no vaginal sex) ideally, you find a place with the following minimum criteria:   Girls smile at you, hold conversation with you, and are nice At least one girl is  not completely flat. Girls do not smell like horrible shit. Girl take off at least their tops, OR give you a good massage (some places where girls actually give you a massage they will not take off clothes) Girl kisses parts of your body, like your nipples (but does not necessarily go down on you) Will not badger you for more money and will not try to get more girls into the room with you unless you ask.   When I was in Beijing, I would go to a massage place on the corner of Dongzhimen Rd. and Chunxiu Rd.  There are about 6 massage parlors on that street on either side of Chunxiu Rd.  I got along with one of the girls.  She would get naked and have me touch and kiss her until she came (or pretended to come).  Then she would do the same to me.  Then I shower and leave.  Most places in Beijing though are ""wam bam thank you mam"" experience.  In Shanghai there is a lot of variety.  There are some places that caters to Japanese; they are cleaner, more expensive, and likely to offer the ""toss your salad"" service, which I'm not into.  One regular looking place in Shanghai was a BJ parlor.  I went in... there were 10 girls sitting there.  I picked a cute older women wearing librarian glasses.  She took my hand and said ""we don't have sex here, only blow job.""  I said great.  She said ""no sex, just blow job. Understand?  I only do blow job"".  Man that was a great place.  200 RMB.  She took her time.  We made out.  She told me my penis was the biggest she ever saw.  I told her we Japanese men all are like that."

China,3dp5ix,zakazaw,3,Sun Jul 19 16:52:54 2015 UTC,"No, although I mean that one surely has something going on.    Exhibit A: It's above an Irish bar.  It was not until I started to visit China that I learned of the idea of getting a massage instead of a kebab after a night of drinking.  In both cases it's a soggy mess by the end.  Exhibit B: It's opposite the Australian embassy.  Sir Les Patterson probably founded this place.  I'm surprised there isn't a zip line over the road.  Anyway I was talking about the place that's on chunxiu liu that has massive Grecian style columns out the front like a row of penises.  It's a massive 6 story 24/7 spa.  It can't be any more obvious.  And who is down voting me?  Is my information not pertinent to the topic of OP?   If you don't think there are brothels in China you have a lot of growing up to do."

China,3dp5ix,zakazaw,19,Mon Jul 20 07:09:41 2015 UTC,"Walk in. Deal with the moment of surprise as the workers realize you're not Chinese (unless you're a regular). Point out the one you want to do whatever with.  Wait while her coworkers whisper to her how much more than normal to charge you because you're a foreigner (again, unless you're a regular).  Follow her through the door to the back of the shop.  Listen to her gasp when she's rubbing your penis with wet wipes and putting on the condom, then listen to her complain about size when you mount her (again, unless you're a regular).  Finish up what you came to do.  Lay back, let her remove the condom and clean you up.  Zip your pants, pay the woman, walk back out into the sunlight and drown your shame with a lukewarm beer from the market next door."

The number of ""China days"" you experience is inversely related to the amount of time you put into learning the language. No matter how nonsensical something seems here, there is ALWAYS a reason it's being done that way...you just don't know what it is. It's just a pet peeve of mine hearing people complain all the time.  TL;DR: You are totally right. Chinese people are just like everyone else...they just speak Chinese."

China,3dmgou,komnenos,10,Sun Jul 19 03:40:52 2015 UTC,"The best one I was privy to happened at Christmas. A bunch of us had ordered a fully cooked turkey and trimmings for a big Xmas dinner. 1200 rambos for the whole deal, paid up front. It was dinner time, and they had still not delivered. The host of the dinner calls up the place and is told, ""Whoops, we forgot. Give us 2 hours and we will have it delivered to you. So sorry.""   Mildly annoyed, everyone makes the best of it, keeps drinking, we do the gift exchange, snack on some stuff...2 hours later still no bird and trimmings. He calls back and is told the guy is on the way. 3 hours later, still no bird. Everyone is hungry, half the party has left by now. Host is steaming..he is a huge guy, and the veins are popping out of his neck while he tries to keep it together for the guests. I know him well, if he doesn't eat soon, there will be hell to pay.  Finally, almost 4 hours later, the bird arrives. It's in a huge box. The delivery nong just hands it and leaves post haste.   The host opens the box. The ""whole turkey"" as promised was sliced up, no whole bird. It was still bleeding and red in the middle. The sides meant for a whole party where not enough for 2 people and the containers were full of turkey blood. Host had had enough...time to go to the source and complain. He called ahead and was hung up on.  He calls a private car, and another guest and I decide to go with him, because we know his temper. The whole car ride to the restaurant that cooks for this butcher shop was a rant of profanity that would have been funny had we not been so damn hungry.   We get there, he storms into the kitchen with the box. Everyone is Chinese, the place is a pig sty, looking back, so glad we didn't eat that turkey. The manager, an ABC that seems to have forgotten the customer service concept of his place of birth, pulls a full on ""Nothing wrong with this, it is fine, not my problem....super dick standard mainland move.""  Host loses his shit. Grabs a mound of turkey with his hands and starts shoving and rubbing it all in the managers face, screaming things like, ""You cheating ch**k, 1200 kuai! 1200 kuai! For this, for this! You eat it! You eat it! It's good eh! You piece of shit motherfucker, if I don't get my money back I'm going to destroy your kitchen."" For emphasis, he dumped some mashed potatoes on his head. We managed to pull him off, and really wanted to get out of there, considering pulling this kind of shit in a room full of Chinese cooks with very sharp knives didn't seem too wise.  Not one of them budged. Not one. Eyes big as saucers the whole time...a few of them laughing at the manager.  The refund was given in full. We found out through others that they had fucked up many orders. China'd. Lucky the cops didn't come.  From this day, whenever the host tells the story (which he loves to) He dubs it, ""The Ch*nk That Stole Christmas.""  I've seen many other rage outs here, but nothing quite like this.  Edit: typos"
China,3dmgou,MaosADong,10,Fri Jul 17 20:01:37 2015 UTC,"That type of shit is the very reason why I never pay upfront for anything in China.

Cash on delivery, after you double checked the items even if that means the kuadi dude must wait 5 minutes. And so on. As for those ABCs in China, some I have met are the biggest fuckers hypocrites pieces of scum ever. Zhongguo Uber Alles! Chinese pride.

China,3dmgou,MaosADong,0,Sat Jul 18 16:30:23 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain, once when I was in Fuzhou meeting my then girlfriend's family her parents recommended we go to a steak restaurant.  Several of her cousins who are international businessmen and have had steak in America said that the restaurant was really good and I should like it.    So she and I go to the restaurant, the whole bus ride over I'm telling her about how for many in the US (including my family) find steak almost sacred as a food.  We get to the restaurant and it looks beautiful (it was almost an exact replica of the high end steak place my family sometimes goes to for special occasions back home), the waiter seated us and we sat down.  I order a filet mignon medium, fries and ice cream for dessert.  First thing that went wrong was they brought the ice cream out first.  No biggy I thought its a different culture after all and I can't expect them to know that dessert comes last.  Joke to my girl that I dreamed of having dessert first as a kid.  Notice that when other steaks were coming out they were ""sizzling"" and thought that was pretty weird but just chalked it up to some gimmick that the restaurant did, they had children's menus that showed all the different cuts and I described the tastes and textures of each to pass the time.  Then the steak came out, I'm about to ask my girlfriend how to say 'A1 sauce' when the waiter interrupts me and says ""red sauce or black sauce?""  I think black sauce may be A1 sauce so I go with that.  He then drenches the whole steak in a thick almost syrupy black liquid and gives me the dish.  I could barely even taste the steak because of that liquid and what little I could taste of the steak was shit.  Hell when I looked at the meat there wasn't a bit of pink to be found in there.  medium my ass.  And the real kicker?  The meal cost as much as the high end place I go to with my family back home.  I guess thats what I get for trusting a 2nd tier city to make western food."

We worked at a school that was pretty careful to take care of it's foreigners (there were enough of us that there was a foreigner that was in charge of the foreigners) and you'd still get meltdowns. Lot of it is just culture shock. Some of it is people that are running away from their lives. Mostly though, it's just recent grads and retirees looking for an adventure. China has been pushing most of the real failures out for awhile though. They tend to end up in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam now."

I think to myself 'these nongren' when I'm in a situation where they spit/smoke/shout on airplanes, throw buckets of garbage out the window, let their kids shit next to where I'm eating, etc. City slickers frown on that stuff, and whether it's stereotype or truth, we blame the migrant population for lack of civility.

But if they start considering I'm Xinjiangnese then the conversation gets comical. Depending on how irritated I woke up.   Is he dangerous? Is he really Xinjiang? If he is maybe he understands us. Maybe he can sell drugs or weapons.   And so on.

China,3dmgou,komnenos,6,Fri Jul 17 15:52:20 2015 UTC,That's an accurate comparison. We had the police stop by our factory 5 years or so ago and specifically tell us not to hire any xinjiang people.

China,3dmgou,kenmorethompson,2,Fri Jul 17 20:03:31 2015 UTC,Whats it like?  I only really know two guys (a professor who I took lots of classes with and my Uighur/Kazakh friend) and everything they have said reminded me of the Jim Crow South.  The way my friend was treated there was astounding and my professor reported that 98% or so of the cops were Han and he interviewed many of the Han cops who worked in Uighur majority/near majority areas and they thought of them as lesser people!
China,3dmgou,komnenos,3,Sat Jul 18 05:25:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly I haven't had much chance to associate too closely with that many Uyghurs, but 90% of the Han people I've beached the topic with have nothing good to say about Uyghurs. An American coworker of mine tried to challenge a racist comment one day in the office and essentially got ""Where the hell were you when I watched my pregnant neighbour rolling on the street, getting the shit kicked out of her by four Uyghur guys?"" So ... it's really difficult to say the racist Han are wrong, too. And I know it goes the other way; I've been at parties thrown by foreigners where, as soon as the last Han leaves, the Uyghurs start to bitch and complain about this and that, and fire back racism just as bad as you get from the Han.   Basically everyone local I know here has some story or another from the race riots in 2009. Few of them acknowledge that the attacks and killings went both ways.   I pass probably 25-40 soldiers every day here now (less in winter), just standing around being visible. There are full-on dragon's teeth vehicle barriers in front of every school in the city, and when parents come to pick up their kids there are at least 12-20 police officers with guns and body armour standing around. Every bus stop has someone guarding it; high risk ones have soldiers, lower risk have police, my neighbourhood has one of the red-armband-volunteers. And this is Urumqi; down south I've heard it's worse.   Paranoia rules the day, and despite all of these things (or, I would suggest, because of them), none of the Han people I've asked feel any safer for all of the 'security measures.'   When I've asked ""But are the soldiers there to make you feel safe, or to make the Uyghurs feel scared."" a few Han have gone ""Huh ... well that's a thought ...""   Anyways, it's actually a nice place. The Han are just Han, largely the same as anywhere, I'd imagine, except 80% of them will complain about how backwards Xinjiang is, and they can't wait to move to Beijing. The Uyghurs are friendly, have great food, and--it must be said--are at least ten times more fun than Han people. But the men are pretty possessive over Uyghur women.  Honestly, I'm sure there's a lot of social bits and pieces to get a handle on anywhere in China, and I'm not saying Urumqi is worse because I genuinely don't know. But goddammit is there a lot going on here.  EDIT: tl;dr: Every local is racist against every other local, but foreigners get a pretty good gig. I'll probably never completely understand it, but goddammit am I trying. It's a nice place though--come visit if you can."

A group of Chinese students between 15-18ish years old were definitely watching us, and getting a good laugh out of our group's  frustration with Chinese culture.   One kid pointed to the line and said a little ""kanqilai"" to his boys, and started walking over.

When I was in Fuzhou where I got to speak with a lot of the younger generation and most of them only spoke a few phrases of Min Dong to talk to their grandparents and several didn't know any besides hello, thank you and other very very basic words that even I had picked up on.  It seemed like everyone who was under 30 was talking in Mandarin to each other.  I remember that the apartment complex I was staying in had shit tons of kids running around and everyone of them was speaking in Mandarin.

They usually charge a few hundred RMB for fees and your bank in europe may charge you a fee to receiving it.   If you don't care for the best deal, look at services similar KVB Kunlun.

Chinese doctors love IVs you can sit outside the hospital and smoke zhongnanhais with your IV attached (probably not flammable).
China,3dq1s6,upads,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:49:21 2015 UTC,Why don't you go to an international hospital or private doctor? Health insurance of your employer or the abroad insurance from your own country should cover it without any problems.  They speak English/German/French etc. and are usually clean as in Europe.

My parents would eat at Chinese restaurants however such restaurants would always have two menus one for the local people and one for the Chinese. Hell you go to Wing Yip in Manchester their restaurant and it's no different from a Cha Chan teng you'd find in Hong Kong... In London and Manchester China town they'll give you a menu depending on your skin colour or not even give you a menu at all as the Chinese folks tend to order stuff which isn't listed.  In fact it is more Hong Kong that Hong Kong. As in Hong Kong and GZ tea houses and restaurants used to have grizzled old women pushing self heating (gas bottle) carts around the dining area filled with cages of dim sum.   Sometimes with vermicelli they'd even stir fry it for you in front of you. But usually carts with steamed goodies in bamboo cages. You'd get a face full of spit when they spoke and would usually be old Hakka ladies who would be extremely vulgar and plentiful in the use of swear words. You'd ask for something and they'd stamp your bill what you took off their cart.  Kinda like this:  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Dim-sum-HK.JPG https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0JBn3SAWc  HK got rid of those mostly 10-15 years ago replacing them with fast waiters or a preparation area where you have to go and walk up to it rather than them go up to you.   It's not quite the same though as the women pushing the steam carts in UK restaurants are younger don't swear and don't cover you in gobs of spit when they speak. Nor do they stamp they have PoS type things and push a button on a screen. It is also cleaner... 2 decades ago I always remember my parents washing the cups, bowls and chopsticks with tea even at the Golden Dragon in Sheffield (UK). Today there is no need for this but my dad still does it out of habit."

The Chinese people I've interacted with tend to joke about American Chinese food such as General Tso chicken, fortune cookies, etc. I've heard that it's largely based on what would typically only be eaten in China during holidays. According to Wikipedia, "" If separate Chinese-language menus are available, they typically feature delicacies like liver, chicken feet, or other meat dishes that might deter American customers.

As much as possible they eat Chinese food that is as similar to China as possible (and often as similar to their region if at all possible, there are many different Chinese cuisines).    When my colleagues are on a business trip in the US, the local Chinese restaurants slip advertisements under the doors (they know when the big conferences are and find out where the Chinese are staying).  They are OK to eat western for a while but eventually they crave Chinese food, and as a group they ditch whatever conference activity has been organized, hire cars and drive to the best Chinese restaurant in town.  But then again, this is what they do in China too.    The Koreans are worse, a lot of them pack a week of kimchi so they do not die without it.  Anywhere Chinese tourists typically go they will know how to find the nearest Chinese style food.  There are of course smartphone apps that have detailed reviews and ratings of every place that they might want to go, all in Chinese, contributed by other tourists.  When touring in Asia I often consult these guides because the western ones often steer you towards places that serve western food (it's amazing how much the lonely planet will hype up the one shitty awful tourist-trap in town that can make a hamburger).    If they are in groups the guide will take them to a Chinese restaurant that gives them a kickback"

China,3dly25,reshuiforever,18,Fri Jul 17 09:58:11 2015 UTC,"China’s biggest state-owned banks have lent a combined Rmb1.3tn ($209bn) to the country’s margin finance agency in recent weeks to staunch a freefall in the stock market, casting doubt on whether the recent equities rebound is sustainable without government support.  China Securities Finance Corp was established in 2011 to lend to securities brokerages to support their margin lending to stock investors. Amid the tumble in equities beginning in late June, however, the government has deployed CSF as a conduit for injecting rescue funds into the stock market.   CSF has lent to brokerages to finance their investment in shares and has also purchased mutual funds directly. But the latest revelations indicate that state support for the stock market is much larger than previously disclosed.  The Shanghai Composite index has recovered about 15 per cent since its low point on July 10, but the magnitude of state support suggests the rally is largely a government-driven phenomenon.  Caijing, a well-known Chinese financial magazine, reported on Friday that the country's sixth-largest lender by assets, China Merchants Bank, provided the largest single loan, at Rmb186bn.  The country’s five largest banks — Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China and Bank of Communications — each provided more than Rmb100bn. In total, 17 banks provided interbank loans worth about Rmb1.3tn through July 13, the magazine reported.  The People’s Bank of China had previously said it was “actively assisting” CSF to obtain liquidity through interbank lending, bond issuance and other methods. The central bank later confirmed it had provided loans directly to CSF, without specifying an amount.  CSF also recently issued bonds worth Rmb800bn in the interbank market, where commercial banks are the biggest investors. Combined with the loans, that brings CSF's total war chest to over Rmb2tn even without including direct loans from the central bank.  The Caijing report suggests the PBoC is seeking to minimise its direct role in lending to CSF, preferring to rely on commercial banks to provide funds for the stock market rescue.  “I think what the PBoC wants to achieve is like ‘do whatever it takes’, as said by [European Central Bank president Mario] Draghi to boost confidence [in the euro], but no need to really print money to buy stocks. They want to do easing, but not this way,” said Larry Hu, China economist at Macquarie Securities.  Still, the central bank regularly lends to commercial banks through various mechanisms, so the PBoC could have provided extra funds to support commercial banks’ loans to CSF.  For the commercial banks, the burden of national service is not too onerous. Their loans to CSF carry little risk, given its status as a state-owned financial institution, and the return on their loans was “pretty good”, according to Caijing.  The Shanghai Composite closed up 3.5 on Friday, capping its second straight week of gains."

China,3dly25,Syptryn,2,Fri Jul 17 15:09:14 2015 UTC,The individual middle class investors invested in smaller companies which aren't being bailed out. The government stock purchases are in large cap (large company) stocks which are mostly bought by institutional investors and other banks.
China,3dly25,foolfromhell,6,Fri Jul 17 15:35:55 2015 UTC,Not to mention the fact that all the billionaires of the ruling families of the CCP have the bulk of their fortune in those stocks.  The CCP is bailing out their own private portfolio with the people's money.  They are not bailing out the stock market.
China,3dly25,corathus59,3,Fri Jul 17 18:07:37 2015 UTC,The proof of this is that the CSRC demanded that the SOE stocks be bailed out only.

China,3dly25,Catpiss_Everdeen,5,Sat Jul 18 03:40:16 2015 UTC,"Ready to go down the rabbit hole? Chinese SOEs would be extinct today without the technical expertise and capital injection of western companies and experts. Mostly Goldman and Morgan Stanley. In the early 90's they worked out these shady deals whereby they could list part of the company on USA exchanges without giving any actual ownership or voting rights or transparency. So say they sold 20% for 20 billion, they would then argue that they hold 80billion in assets ( their own stock) and borrow against it. But they frequently fail to repay their loans ( and the Chinese govt never forces them to). Instead the people of China are left footing the bill while the SOE upper management get fabulously rich on stolen money. Basically it's a big carousel that funnels money from the government to the party.  Fun and games in the world's biggest kleptocracy!"

China,3dly25,NotWantedForAnything,3,Fri Jul 17 16:47:54 2015 UTC,"The SOEs are probably also involved in a kind of margin lending, whereas they use their stock ( all SOEs are still majority owned by the govt.

So if their stock market collapses, their assets collapse, their loans become untenable etc. The whole system in China is a nightmare of these kind of shady accounting practices."

Companies in China can, with the right paperwork, legally pay foreign companies for goods and services. But if they don't have that worked out, it's not really your problem.  Send what I told you, and if they respond that they need a Chinese fapiao, tell them that you simply can't provide it, as you are an Australian company.

Company 2 can just pay you dividends (which you can also pay taxes on, depending on your residency status, and a lot of other factors:  ""talk to your tax advisor"").  But the real answer, especially presuming that the new company you are going to set up with your friends is almost certainly going to be a WFOE, is to own your shares in the WFOE through a separate Hong Kong parent company.  The WFOE sends profit or service fees or whatever to its Hong Kong parent, and the Hong Kong company pays you salary, or dividends, or ""benefits"" or whatever.  No payments your receive from the Hong Kong company are reportable or taxable in the PRC*, and nobody is ever going to come looking anyway.  *Under current rules, technically speaking you ideally want to be out of China for ninety days total, or thirty days consecutively, once every five years so that you don't become taxable on global income."

I've seen Chinese names that mean anything from strong country, to girls with names that basically were their parents saying: ""We wanted a dude instead"". Pick out characters based on what your English name sounds like. The former Australian Prime Minister's name is Kevin, and his Chinese teacher gave him the name Ke Wen, 壳文, which happens to be, according to him, conqueror of literature. Pick whatever fuck you want, look up two characters that looks/sounds/have kick ass meaning to them, and stick them together. Make sure they don't mean something vulgar and you're set to go. Consult the I Ching    Good luck"

Most Chinese have English names because so many foreigners find it difficult to pronounce Chinese words/characters (whatever).  If you really want a Chinese name, it would be best just to ask a Chinese friend to help come up with one as they are more complex than other names (their names tend to actually mean something), so usually they might give you a name based on how they feel about your personality of characteristics."

And those objectives were not scientific or economic to begin with.    Moon might not have much resources (it actually does quite a bit) for practical purposes but that is besides the point.    Humans need a base of operations and testing stage. We can't just drop base on Mars without practice. Moon is like 2-3 days from Earth, if anything goes wrong with the Mars operations its half a year before anything could be done from Earth.    Moon is far yet close enough to prepare us to explore further. Plus its even harsher in many regards to Mars since it has no atmosphere and weak magnetosphere and lesser gravity."

China,3dlalo,woodwedge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:02:20 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think it is an interesting experiment and during peak periods 4G might still get a better experience than VPNs, especially on the usual crappy servers provided in Hong Kong by popular companies like Astrill.   When I lived in Shanghai I used to often get around 100-150ms to Hong Kong at peak times.  If you watch the 2nd youtube video I linked they are conducting a speedtest with 75ms ping / 20mbps from a rooftop supposedly 30km away from the tower."

Long-term success and profitability is a total non-factor when it comes to getting your nice government payday.  A bit of guanxi and pai ma pi-ing, some choice key words (""big data""... groan), and some headline figures (office space, employees, gigabytes of big data thingies!) that will make the leader look good in the short-term.... Then you can get your tasty check (""investment"") from the government, which will never get followed-up on. Which is fortunate because you spend it all on Apple laptops and T-shirts and team dinners etc. etc. anyway  Pretty much the same thing goes for private equity investing it seems, too. Which is even harder to fathom."
China,3djwii,nimbleal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:00:40 2015 UTC,"I had my dissertation focus on innovation in China. Whilst I was expecting to find out something new from this article out of interest. Innovation falls under a general form of product/service experimentation, user-led innovation (improving through feedback) and mostly innovating processes more so than end result goods and services (such as implementing simultaneous engineering to complete projects at a rapid pace).  If you're interested, the best article I remember going through that discusses China's innovation system would be from MIT.    http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/accelerated-innovation-the-new-challenge-from-china/  There a number of improvements that need to be made though, such as retention of talented staff, usually consisting those who studied abroad which leads on to the fact that they need to really develop the quality of their education system (whilst not terrible, it is extremely linear and lacks in an ability for students to develop creative skills). R&D has been heavily spent on government projects in which some cases funding has been given to two separate projects that are aiming to achieve the same goal (question of corruption or purely a lack of R&D fund management). Private companies in China on the other hand don't receive enough funding and feel less encouraged to innovate, but to produce cheaply (thus innovation in processes to save money). The same problem comes with patents, where China is one of the top countries for patent submissions but there is more quality than quantity in these patents."

China,3dlpkq,ASunDr,7,Fri Jul 17 07:51:59 2015 UTC,"Standard official requirement for work visa is 2 years post grad experience and TEFL cert preferred. If you keep looking you'll find a job at a company willing to wrangle you a work visa with some behind the scenes fraud eventually, especially if you cast your net in less desirable third tier locations. You may find however that less legit schools also treat their teachers (and everyone else) poorly."
China,3dlpkq,downvotesyndromekid,5,Fri Jul 17 08:17:21 2015 UTC,Am I really not qualified to teach English in China?   Yes. Wait two years and get your TESOL. You MAY get a school to hire you in some boring backwards village where the boss will treat you lIke shit but your visa would just end up getting rejected anyways (you're too young).
China,3dlpkq,kanada_kid,5,Fri Jul 17 08:40:31 2015 UTC,"Unless they're changed it recently, the law states that you need a Bachelor's and minimum of 2 years relevant experience. Your age prevents you from claiming that. Go get whatever work you can. In two years time, fudge your CV to say that you worked in a training company teaching English to new migrants. They're not going to check that. The TEFL/TESOL requirement is not required but some schools ask for it. teflonline.com have a 40 hr course that costs a couple of hundred dollars. Do it online sometime in the next two years and you've got that rubber stamp sorted. There are agencies and schools that will tell you you don't need a work visa, come on over, it's fine, really. They are lying. If anything goes wrong, you'll lose out big time, get fined or deported. Don't leave your jome country until you have a Z visa in your wallet.    General tips:   It's very common to hear about recruiters making threats about blacklisting etc. Don't accept any bullshit about things being urgent. They're scum of the earth. Generally speaking you should be talking directly to the schools, be they regular or commercial chains.  Save your cash for the next two years. The exchange rate for China is very favourable to the foreigner. The more cash you have in your account, the easier life will be when you're there. Chain schools hire all year round. Regular schools and unis start their academic year in September so in June 2017, start looking. Ask in here and in /r/TEFL when the time comes. Folks are likely to give you some shit but you'll also get a handful of people who will be able to put you in touch with someone who knows someone who actually works in a school.   Also it wouldn't hurt to study Mandarin at night school. You don't need it to teach ESL and indeed you shouldn't be using it in the classroom but it WILL make general life a whole lot easier."
China,3dlpkq,ratsta,2,Fri Jul 17 09:13:32 2015 UTC,"I honestly think location is your key point. I have plenty of friends who have neither a degree or a tesol (though I'm sure some of them fudged a fake one via photoshop)and are working excellent jobs making well over 10k a month. Southern China is getting more strict on where you are from, so only America, UK, Canada, Austrlia and New Zealand are ""native speakers"" (eye roll...) and I'm not so sure about the north. Like someone else mentioned, a smaller city will most likely be a good place to start, and after a year of experience you will be qualified for much bigger and better places if you choose to stay. And I don't know about everyone else, but my TESOL course was a complete waste of money ad a joke...so you're not missing out any important info there. Just make sure you read the contracts REALLY thouroughly, because yes, employers will definitely sneak a tiny little thing here or there which will eventually lead ot conflict between you and them."

This opened the world to fifty years of US popular culture. If Russia thinks it somehow deserves an equal playing field, it's right, but it's also deluding itself. The global cultural hegemony ship has sailed, and England/America won, a long time ago. Changing that fact is functionally impossible. Russia and China can form pacts, learn each others language, etc, and over time things might certainly change. But until China and Russia manage to convince the rest of the world they are politically resilient, have attractive social and economic values, and set up movie and music industries with the same level of expertise as the US, they will face a very, very steep climb."

China,3dhgj4,jeanlugson,3,Thu Jul 16 12:50:47 2015 UTC,"Well, although I guess conservative or not depends on your point of perspective. I still think they're not conservative, but secretive.   Like my friend there he was trying to impress me about how hip him and his roommate is. And I used to hang a lot with Chinese classmates and its a common secret in China after you become a couple gf/bf sex is mandatory.  I also found countless couple having sex in the park at night, behind bushes when I come back from my evening class (when I did master I got a class from 8:30 to 10:30 pm). I found condoms in the toilet, in the park, classroom, etc.  Oh yeah, once I sneak to a female dorm once to eat like new year hot pot and my friend's roommate is doing it on the next room beside us.

There's no sexual content in advertising, people rarely hold hands in public and no kissing either.  You seem to think I'm suggesting no one is fucking, I'm not.

I know there are strip clubs and whores and you can get hand jobs and get laid but publicly it's conservative.  There's no nudity or sexual content allowed in the media.  They even banned car girls at the shanghai auto show.  Counter this to a western country where every billboard hoarding uses sex to sell, young children are sexualised at a young age, there is endless swearing and nudity on tv shows.  There are bars like hooters all over the place.  Porn is widely prevalent and strip clubs are out in the open.  In some countries and states of the US prostitution is legal.  Of course there is a seedy side to China but it's really under wraps.  I don't know where you are in China -Dongguan? - but there are fuck all brothels near where I live."

China,3dhgj4,cursedapple,8,Thu Jul 16 12:32:39 2015 UTC,"OK, I will help break this down for you.  Part of the reason the video is a big deal because normally Chinese people see very sexy Japanese people having sex, but not Chinese people.  And this would have been a lot better if the video had a Japanese girl, because then we would get to see a girl with really big boobs.  And we would get to see the boobs boobing around.  Which is what I like and what all manly, heterosexual handsome men like me should like.    That being said, the girl has servisable boobs.  Not big... but almost a handful.  She also plays with her boobs and nipples a lot.   So plus points for that.    She has a really pretty face... a face that would look good in different types of sex acts.  A face I , and many other strapping heterosexual men, could fantasize about.    At the beginning of the video she just looks like she is checking herself out while getting fucked; the same look you see on your girl-date's face as she takes selfies for weixin while you try to strike up a conversation.  But later, you can see she is getting into it.  She flushes and pouts.  Then she takes her lover's hand and moves that to her love-delta, suggesting he stroke her while he also takes his pleasure.    Overall, pretty good.  Except the whole video is missing a cum-shot and no bukkake.  ... so not sure how long this will stay in my porn collection."
China,3dhgj4,ogami_ito_sugoi_jiba,6,Thu Jul 16 13:17:29 2015 UTC,"You have a good point, even though I don't watch the Japanese porn or the Chinese home made porn but I bet professional made porn always beat the home made shitty plus average looking? porn.

Ford aren't considered 'cool' like BMW, Land Rover, Mercedes, Audi etc.. (you'll pretty much only see these foreign brands mostly on the roads in China). Like Tesla is a great car, but they are flopping in China because nobody things they are cool (as well as a lack of charging stations to boot).

Middle class cars are far more common, like vw, Ford, Honda, Nissan etc.   Let's find some stats, brb.  Here we go:   The best-selling passenger cars by brand in China are:[31] 1. Volkswagen (including FAW Volkswagen and Shanghai Volkswagen) 2. Shanghai Wuling 3. Beijing Hyundai 4. Changan 5. Toyota (FAW Toyota and GAC Toyota) 6. Shanghai Buick 7. Nissan (Dongfeng Nissan and Zhengzhou Nissan) 8. Changan Ford 9. Honda (GAC Honda, Dongfeng Honda and Honda China) 10. Shanghai Chevrolet 11. Dongfeng Yueda Kia 12. Dongfeng 13. Audi (FAW Volkswagen) 14. Chery 15. BYD 16. Haval (Great Wall) 17. Geely   The best-selling locally produced cars on the Chinese mainland in 2013 are:[32] 1. Chang'an Ford Focus 2. Shanghai GM Volkswagen Lavida 3. Shanghai GM Buick Excelle 4. Shanghai GM Chevrolet Sail 5. FAW Volkswagen Sagitar 6. FAW Volkswagen Jetta 7. Dongfeng Nissan Sylphy 8. Shanghai GM Chevrolet Cruze 9.

China,3dkwne,BribedUncle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:10:31 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I would say don't write a comment if you're going to be a dick about your response. Courtesy goes a long way.  Unfortunately, having not appreciate the attitude displayed in your response and being slightly annoyed by this, my response might also come across as being pretty rude, so don't take it to heart. No need to be flustered over strangers on the internet.    Source for those stats? Also, speaking my opinion from my experiences in China (having lived in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai over the past three years - which may not seem like much, but whatever) I've rarely - not never - come across a Ford, unless it's popular in poorer regions. The point of my statement was that ""you'll pretty much only see these foreign brands mostly on the roads in China"" as opposed to Chinese brand vehicles. Not specifically the European brands which I stated beforehand as examples, but foreign brands in general - I a few EU examples because I can't be fucked to ream off a list of foreign brands.  Just to note: The 'Europe Autonews' site you linked doesn't give much credibility as it seems to be a bit sloppy and dated, which makes me feel that the owners can't be bothered with their web design and most likely their content either.  Additionally, whilst the Focus as an individual product maybe the most popular car from your mysterious source, it isn't the most popular brand, that doesn't really say much to me.  (being eighth in your other mysterious source). Like say the Fiat 500 or maybe the BMW Mini sold shit tonnes in the UK, but still I didn't see them very frequently compared to other brand cars as a whole during their height of sales.  In the end however (and this is the main fundamental point of my comment), none of this justifies anything. It just demonstrates that one company is losing sales in China. We could simply assess the factor that consumers are just simply not as interested in vehicles made by Ford as much as they used to be and as a result the company's growth has also slowed, whether or not it is 'catastrophic' depend on the context, which brings me on to....   One fundamental criticism I can make on my own comment, which is that I had interpreted OP's post in thought that he was assessing the slowdown of the Chinese economy as a whole based on declining sales growth by Ford. However he could just simply talking about a catastrophic slowdown of Ford in general, which to me is unclear and as a result may not clearly justify what I was originally trying to explain in my first comment.  I still stand by my original statement though, that this slower growth is because the cars being produced by Ford lately just simply aren't appealing, and therefore most likely becoming less popular. It's a common sense statement to make in business.. ""If people don't like your shit, they aren't gonna buy it"".  TL;DR: Gave some examples of popular vehicles I have frequently seen in China more than others, based on places I live lived during my short few years there. Couldn't be fucked to list every single brand, so missed non-EU brands which are also popular. A car company producing lower growth rates than expected probably means that people don't find their cars interesting/value for money. Mysterious sources are mysterious - thus lack credibility. I probably misinterpreted OP's post in that he was talking about Chinese economy as a whole being 'catastrophic' based on Ford car sales data, rather than just the company in general."

China,3dihzp,DetachedObserver,5,Thu Jul 16 15:24:47 2015 UTC,"A brilliant expose, but there are simpler and more mundane realities that have been the prime drivers of the last thirty years.  Primarily the simple fact that the baby boom of the West came into it's decades of primary consumption right as Deng came to power.  The largest demographic bulge in history, and they were at the peak of Western prosperity, and buying, buying, buying.  Coupled to that trend was the simple reality of an absolute police state willing to auction off it's own people as slave labor to feed that consumption wavelength.  They were also willing to completely despoil their own country environmentally to make a quick buck.  We have never seen so many billionaires come into existence so quickly, and almost all of them are members of the ruling families of the communist party.  The Central Committee is the single greatest concentration of billionaires on earth.  The crack up of this system that we are all watching at this time is equally mundane in it's causes.  The Baby Boom demographic is being followed by the smallest demographic generation in the history of the West, and this collapsing demographic is being amplified off the economic chart by the financial crisis of 08.  Western consumption has collapsed.    The rulers of China pocketed all the profits of the last thirty years and used and abused their own people for the whole ride.  Now it is too late for them to create a domestic economy, and the world has fantastic industrial overcapacity.  China is going to have to close more than half their factories right as half their country goes into elderly retirement without savings, and without safety net.  All happening in an environmental disaster that is only beginning to come into focus.  A bubble a thousand times bigger than America's bubble of 29 is about to pop.  This pop is issuing from very mundane and greedy causes.  Not contradictions in ideologies, nor mandates of heaven.  The only remaining question is how long a police state can defer the inevitable reckoning."
China,3dkohe,Ayoulayoua88,5,Fri Jul 17 01:22:00 2015 UTC,"That's not even including the bad debt that the big banks use a collateral to issue loans.   I'm really bad at these things, but from what I've been reading, basically the big banks and the Chinese authorities have been pulling the mother of all pyramid schemes. Here's how it works:  The banks are drowning in bad debt (has happened once or twice a decade ever since the opening up). The debt gets shifted to a third party AMC. No write downs occur (the loans are treated as if they are still ""good""). The AMC issues bonds to the value of the debt. Banks assume the bonds with money from the central govt. Now the banks have assets they can use as collateral to issue more loans to the same fucks that didn't repay their last loans!  Wow, finance is easy! Now that 1trillion in debt is actually 1 trillion in assets! When will the assets be realized? Who is the guarantor? Who gives a shit? The party big wigs and their cronies can keep funneling public money into their private graft networks and everyone is either happy or too stupid and cowed to care. Rinse and repeat every five years as necessary!  The only problem is, it only works when china's economy is hermetically sealed. As China tries to expand their influence they are more vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of global capital, and more open to scrutiny.  The time for the correction is coming soon. All those who've invested in China are going to feel like idiots. Meanwhile the moneyed class of China are living happily in Vancouver, Sydney, San Diego, London. The beaten and broken of China will continue as they have these last five thousand years. Penniless and powerless, chattel to the whims of the ones with the whips."

Nominal GDP growth can be easily achieved through debt - you simply keep borrowing to buy/build/invest/etc.  Real GDP growth needs to go over and above debt levels. If GDP is growing at 7% but debt is increasing at 10%, you're probably going backwards (there are exceptions, of course, for things like large infrastructure investments, which provide a pay-off in the long run).  So the real question - is all this borrowing actually going towards productive investment? Or is it simply papering over the underlying unprofitability of certain sectors?  My money's on the latter."

According to the report on July 16, on this day at around 3 PM, the Rolls-Royce that Psy was riding was making a right turn when it collided with a bus.  It was revealed that the accident resulted in no casualties, which comes as a relief.   The Hangzhou traffic police stated, ""The bus driver had made the report and relayed that he had reached an agreement with the owner of the Rolls-Royce regarding problems like compensation.""  A media outlet in China reported, ""Although it was a simple car accident, it was revealed belatedly that Psy was in the car during the accident, so it's becoming a hot topic.""  It appears he was planning to do a congratulatory performance at a party celebrating the opening of a bar in Hangzhou on July 17.   It was reported that after the accident, Psy moved to another vehicle, a Porsche, that had been traveling with the Rolls-Royce and left.  He had been provided four cars since his arrival in Hangzhou by the party host, so the Rolls-Royce had been just one of the four.  His rep responded on July 17 to the reports with, ""It is true there had been a car accident. He is not hurt anywhere at all.  He plans to go up on stage in perfect condition."" Hopefully everybody involved is doing okay!    I am a bot that transcribes allkpop articles."

China,3dgwm5,BornIntoConfusion,6,Fri Jul 17 03:13:57 2015 UTC,"Foxconn's defining characteristic is not that workers live in dorms... that is a Dongguan thing.    The reason why there are so many workers from other areas is because Dongguan / Shenzhen (and to a much lesser extent other areas) use a corrupt system of ""work-heads"" who get labor from polytechnic schools in interior cities."
China,3dgwm5,jiaxingseng,4,Thu Jul 16 07:04:31 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate? Why is this a corrupt system and how is it different from just companies recruiting people?
China,3dgwm5,brownianhacker,13,Thu Jul 16 07:17:08 2015 UTC,"The workheads (工头）contract out to others in cheaper cities. They in turn go to polytechnic schools and pay off school-master and professors, who then tell their class to travel to the coastal city to work in an ""internship"".  Low level assemblers are often these interns.  Sometimes the students are not interns, but are given actual jobs... but paid a low salary (slightly higher than their home-local average, but far below average salary of coastal-city locals).  Sometimes the students are essentially forced onto these internships... the professor will not let them graduate otherwise.  Most of the time, the students will just go to the factory because the professor/headmaster just told them to do this.    Dongguan itself does not have that many people, so most workers come from elsewhere.  Factories in Jiangsu (Suzhou, Wuxi, etc) and Zhejiang (Hangzhou, Ningbo) often are required by local political elite to hire at least 50% of their workers locally.    Foxconn does pay above average for it's workforce, and does provide OK (at least China-average) benefits.  But there are many other ways in which Foxconn is corrupt and dirty as sin, from top to bottom.  And the company fails to provide meaningful advancement opportunity to most of it's workers.  One obvious clue to corruption in the labor supply chain however... those Foxconn factories in Dongguan house over 100K employees on their campuses.  Ever think about how they keep 100K+ young, bored workers...who know they will never reach economic success by working at that company... from getting together to... unionize?"
China,3dgwm5,jiaxingseng,8,Thu Jul 16 07:43:30 2015 UTC,"Also you should mention that Foxconn not only pays above average, but they also keep their words. If they say you'll get 3K salary, you'll get your 3K rambos, on time, not in some kind of company voucher. As sad as it is, this is actually a thing to worry about in China."
China,3dgwm5,JillyPolla,3,Thu Jul 16 08:58:25 2015 UTC,"Most companies pay what is owed... not doing so will mean a strike, anywhere.  Foxconn may pay OK.  There conditions are no worse than others.  But they are corrupt from top to bottom and hence all their vendors are corrupt as well. They are more internally corrupt than average Chinese companies.   This corruption most definitely affects worker pay.  Common corruption there includes assignment of overtime work to workers who have good relationships with production planning / shift supervisors, or those who pay kickbacks to said supervisors."
China,3dgwm5,jiaxingseng,2,Thu Jul 16 14:14:40 2015 UTC,"Most companies pay what is owed... not doing so will mean a strike, anywhere.   Plenty of managers have skipped town while owing their workers for 3+ months worth of backpay.  As the economies get worse, these cases can only increase.  Also, striking is a form of collective bargaining which is typically handled rather harshly with government approval."
China,3dgwm5,suddenlyshills,2,Thu Jul 16 17:52:24 2015 UTC,"Plenty of managers have skipped town while owing their workers for 3+ months worth of backpay.   Yes.  Happens alot.  But not most companies do this. I think you are right that this will start to happen more often.   Also, striking is a form of collective bargaining which is typically handled rather harshly with government approval.   It generally is not ""handled rather harshly"" at all... as long as the strike is local (does not spread), the factory is not particularly government connected, and the strikers do not carry signs or symbols which would suggest organization.  In other words, if the strike is about workers angry at a company and not something that smells like the beginning of a labor movement, the strike is usually not prevented.    Note that far far more common than actually striking is work slow-downs.  If workers all show up for work but do not actually work, there is little that the company can do to stop this."
China,3dgwm5,jiaxingseng,2,Thu Jul 16 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Good factories pay on time and are honest about salary levels, however shit.  That's worth something to these workers who have 9/10 times been cheated before out of wages.

However, unlike Chinese provinces, states in India have a huge degree of power, and are often run by parties opposed to the ruling party in the Centre.   There are plenty of workers willing to move for a decent wage - which can easily be a third of what you'd have to pay Chinese workers - but they are generally poorly educated. For all the problems with Chinese education, they've done a good job with basic literacy.   There have been plans before for massive industrial parks before that have been shut down because of political infighting. You think red tape, chaos and corruption are bad in China? India is an entirely different level.   That being said, if India can get the ball rolling with massive international investment in manufacturing, it will be great for the country, and could hopefully spur China into making more meaningful social and economic reforms."

You can use bullish/bearish in many contexts, but with a single sentence topic title (where you're talking about business activity in entering a new market, no less) I'm going to default to the most commonplace meaning. Uber - got fucked up by lack of government and business relationships. They invested heavily for obvious reasons, but that doesn't mean they haven't faced significant (more than anticipated) challenges. Youtube/facebook/google - evidence of the reach of government regulations in protecting domestic companies. Netflix will face the same challenge. Xiaomi - domestic player who is coming into the same space. How is a direct competitor not relevant?   But most importantly, do you always talk like that, or just when you get into e-arguments?"

You'll make friends from all over the world, you'll learn a new language (the basics, at least), and get to really see a and experience a foreign culture. Visiting is one thing but living there is another. If you're going to go there as part of some company's expat program it's going to be sweet beans. It depends on her job ofc but at least for me and most of my friends in that high school had drivers, housemaids, and great apartments with a relocation office to help with moving, visas and stuff life that.

Driving, prom, etc. that being said, all your friends now, will be going their separate ways in a few years to college, so you are just doing it a little earlier.  Assuming you are headed towards an international high school, you will have tons of fun, tons more freedom, and will expand your horizons in unimaginable ways.  that's not to say that it's an easy decision or position for a teenager to make, but it's a cool, unique opportunity.  The people I've met who grew up here, and went to US college and came back, are all very mature, distinguished young adults.  but I know it sucks...trying to put myself in your position, I'm not sure if I would have been able to be objective enough to pull the trigger and make the plunge, but as an older person, I hope you are able to make the jump, and do it with enthusiasm and get the most out of it that you can.

China,3dfjpl,justinchina,11,Thu Jul 16 04:26:59 2015 UTC,"Excuse me for this long ass comment:  My dad got a job in china when i was 9.   Initially i was pissed, depressed, and hormonal but it got better. The original plan was to stay one year, then one more, then screw it lets finish elementary school in china before moving back, this time its a promise they said. A year later, nope we're staying for middle school too. And then high school. Thank god my mom dragged my sister and I back to the states. I missed home. Currently in high school here and there really is no place like home.  But at the same time, I miss china too. It grows on you and if you actually integrate yourself successfully into chinese society, its a great place (i obviously failed). Transportation if you live in a big city is just amazing. Food is amazing. All the interesting shops, people, and places. The big cities are extremely diverse and modern. Smaller cities let you experience a more authentic china.   Where you live and what school you go to really matters too. As an expat, most people live in kushy white neighborhoods with white neighbors or at least english speaking wealthy neighbors. Most companies pay for international schools for the kids too which is great. Personally i love international schools. Theyre basically preppy rich kid schools exclusive to foreigners which sounds terrible but isnt really that bad. Sure there are stuck up snobby kids who treat chinese natives like shit but most kids grew up normal in suburbs and just happened to get relocated. The extracurriculars activities, facilities, teachers, staff, and just school in general are usually top notch (youre paying quite a lot too). Compared to an american public school? Theres no comparison. At the same time i have also gone to a completely local school and lived in poorer neighborhoods. My neighborhood convinience stores ripped me off money, children pissed right on the ground, people smoked and littered everywhere. It wasnt violently dangerous, but it was filthy... and the rich/poor gap was appalling.   All in all china was an amazing experience and while i wouldnt say it was the best place on earth, it was certainly memorable. Sometimes i wish i hadnt gone and other times im glad i did. It really opens your eyes to how big and different the world is versus this american dream illusion that we all live in.   Tl;dr i ranted on my experiences in china. Wow this was off topic. And its a waste of effort not to post."
China,3dfjpl,yyhtorod,7,Thu Jul 16 04:46:28 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a great opportunity. One thing to keep in mind is that preparation for college might become a bit more difficult, as you'll have to chase down transcripts and other stuff remotely. Hopefully if you get into a good international school in China, they will have experienced counselors to help out with that.  Speaking of which, I want to second what a lot of other people have said: your mother needs to figure out now what her company is offering in regards to your schooling. International schools can be very expensive (several tens of thousands a year), and if her company isn't covering that, it could wipe out any other financial incentives they are offering.  Chinese schools basically aren't an option for you, unless you are already a native-level speaker of Chinese."

China,3dfjpl,ArcboundChampion,2,Wed Jul 15 22:33:58 2015 UTC,If for some reason you'd get enrolled in a Chinese school it might not be as great of a time.   It's unlikely that a child on an international package would be enrolled in a Chinese school.
China,3dfjpl,lumloon,11,Thu Jul 16 02:10:20 2015 UTC,"If your mum gets sent out to China, she will most likely be on a good salary and live in an apartment which will shelter you from the shittier aspects of Chinese life. I assume the company will also help with relocation etc so she won't have the hassle of looking for a place to live. As timlars said, living in China on an expat package is on a completely different level to that of living in China as an English teacher, student, or someone working at a Chinese company.  As for the language, I wouldn't worry about it. It is a lot easier to learn to a decent level than people would have you believe. The hardest part of trying to learn Chinese will be stirring up the courage to speak to the locals, no matter if your Chinese is shit or not. Don't let people always use you to practice English. I assume the top international schools are similar to schools in the US/Europe so you probably won't be studying night and day like the locals do.  Of course, the living conditions in China will be worse than those in a decent part of the US or a wealthy European country. There is not much care for hygiene and cleanliness so be prepared for a few bouts of explosive diarrhea. The rest you probably know about (pollution, food problems etc). As i said above, if your mum is on an expat package you will avoid most of the shit a lot of us here have to face on a daily basis and so it should be an enjoyable experience.  I would tell your mum to go for it if she has the opportunity. After you have graduated from high school with good grades you can go wherever you want (if you don't want to stay in China)."

The good news is that the younger generations mostly couldn't give a fuck, the older generations only really care if it's one of their kids who's gay (gotta have that grandchild! That's literally all that matters) and as a foreigner you'd be regarded as a bit weird anyway, so being gay is just gravy.

You will start up in the international bubble, with English-speaking friends from various countries, and can then choose whether you want to study Chinese and get local friends. For my daughter (now 18) school was a bit more demanding than at home, but nothing she couldn't catch up with.   If you have any input in the decision to move, I'd say you should argue for it. You will get exposed to and learn about people from wildly different cultures, but you will also learn how similar people are regardless of their background. It is an experience that cannot hurt you, but which could give you a lot."

I think this is your best  bet and believe me, studying Chinese is going to be one of the most amazing things you'v ever done (it depends on where you do it). If you do it in Beijing (wudaokou) like me, in Beijing Language and Culture University you're going to have a fucking blast. The best time of my life I spent there. Do that for a few years and then go do your degree abroad or something. But start studying Chinese now, and put it very high on your list of priorities.  If this happens you're going to have a very adventurous life so look forward to that, I would love to be in your shoes.

I'm going to do a year there and Tsinghua's summer quarter next year and I've found everything online related to the schools lacking.  The only laowai I know who studied there was one of my professors in my undergrad who recommended it to me but he's twice my age and I know things would have been incredibly different back when he was there.  Hope its not too personal to ask, I'm really looking forward to going over to Beijing but I want to hear from others who have gone there in the past."
China,3dfjpl,2akurate,2,Thu Jul 16 06:57:06 2015 UTC,"I lived with a Chinese family when I was in Tsinghua so I can't really say anything about campus life, but from my experience the Tsinghua crowd (even though its just international language students) is different from BLCU. Because Tsinghua has such a big name it attracts a certain kind of person (I guess) and I personally had more difficulty making a lot of friends there. I did have friends mind you but in BLCU EVERYBODY is your friend almost, people are way more chilled out. And the fact that I lived in the legendary Building 17 only made it even better (socially speaking). The classes are also better setup in BLCU, they are new and have everything built in. For instance in Tsinghua the listening teacher will have to bring in her own audio material, this means big ass radio and sometimes separate speakers which work to a varying degree. In BLCU everything is already built into the classroom, I don't even know where the speakers are but they're there somewhere and everything is being controlled by a control panel at the teachers desk. The classrooms in BLCU are way more modern and in general newer than those in Tsinghua, ESPECIALLY when doing the year program in BLCU. BLCU classrooms for year students are all equipped with computers and headsets, very techy.   We should however be reasonable when taking into account the classroom and the influence it has on your learning, honestly it doesn't have THAT much influence but its just all around a nicer experience.  Teacher wise I would say both Tsinghua and BLCU are very good, BUT BLCU is slightly better, this of course is hard to measure as your teachers in Tsinghua could very well be different from mine which would make this comparison completely useless. But in general BLCU's teachers are extremely good, only the best of the best students who graduate BLCU can get positions there.  Warning, BLCU is known as the ""party school"" among Tsinghua professors. There is a reason for this, its because its true. I could buy any alcohol I wanted in the super market IN MY DORM. We would buy beers and chill out in the lobby in front of the service desk where a bunch of service people were sitting. They didn't give a shit, we would sing, yell and get smashed and nobody cared. You can also bring guests to your BLCU room anytime you want without them getting registered, this is completely different from Tsinghua rooms where they will register you and call you at 11pm to tell you you gotta leave.   So there is more freedom in BLCU, BUT! I started skipping a lot of lessons the last 2 months of my semester and ended up not even attending the exams and I know a lot of people who ended up like me. This is the risk of BLCU, so it depends entirely on your own personality and requirements which school you choose. Good luck  Quick note, BLCU is FULL of girls, there's probably six girls to a boy ratio going on there and all of the people in that school are learning to teach english to foreigners which means they will want to be your language partner and approach you. This is different from Tsinghua were the Chinese people there are VERY busy working on their engineering degrees and what not, they'll only approach you to interview you for some kind of project LOL (happened to me several times).    Another note, the BLCU campus has AMAZING coffee shops, super well decorated and amazing places to study (BLCU has on campus KTV!!!). Tsinghua has one called Paradisio wish compared to the BLCU ones is pretty bad.  Another note, sorry for these notes but things are popping up in my head so I keep editing. On Tsinghua campus there are only canteens which open at specific hours and close at specific hours. BLCU has canteens open the whole day until 8pm. On top of that it has non university affiliated food places on campus if you get tired of the canteen food, Tsinghua has a burger place open though...  When talking about recreation on campus both campuses are well decked out, BLCU has some 6 basketball courts, 2 (or 3?) tennis courts, 1 Football field with around it a running track, 4 volleyball fields, 3 badminton courts (inside). BLCU gym is also very nicely decked out, but so is Tsinghua's. I'm not even going to count Tsinghua's sport facilities, just multiply the BCLU one's by 2 minimum. Both have a swimming pool.   Tsinghua campus is further from Wudaokou, even though Tsinghua is in the center of wudakou with its main gate the campus is so big that if you wanna go there from the dorms (which are completely on the opposite side of this gate) you will have to walk for a solid 20 minutes (if not more). Most people have bicycles though.  WARNING: Tsinghua dorms have time limits on warm shower water. You cannot shower after a certain time (I think 7pm). BLCU doesn't have this limit, however Tsinghua double dorms give each student his own room (closed off), BLCU double room means you will have your bed next to your roommate's bed, one living space. The shower will always have hot water and your room will be cleaned by personnel everyday. Depending on where in the building you live they could come in at 7am or 10am."
China,3dfjpl,komnenos,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:58:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply!  I just got into BLCU several days ago and even though I've scoured practically every page on their website they're still missing the personal touch and its nice to know what its actually like to live there.  If you have any other stories or experiences I'd love to hear them either here or in message form.  What were the ladies like?  And how many Chinese friends did you end up making?
China,3dfjpl,2akurate,2,Fri Jul 17 00:13:17 2015 UTC,"I made about 10 Chinese friends including girlfriends ;p LOL  But you could make way more if you were motivated, its just that I personally didn't like to hangout with Chinese guys very much, I dunno why, being with foreigners was just easier and I'm not that dedicated to the language.   Chinese girls? There are a few categories. First of all you have the super typical Chinese girl, her life revolves around studying and ""playing"" with her friends, which consists of walking on the street and eating together, this is what is considered fun for them. They are more innocent than western girls which some people construe as being naive but I don't. I think this innocence is a beautiful thing, anyway this trait is not isolated to this type of Chinese girl.  You have the slightly atypical girl in that she likes foreign cultures, speaks English pretty well but remains quite conservative in the way she prioritizes and orders her life. She might be interested in foreign guys out of curiosity but thinks Chinese guys are more dependable and sees her future with them.   The girl that loves foreign culture but is balanced enough not to throw out her own. This girl again has great English, very open minded but is not going full westerner because she recognizes the merits of her own culture and tries to find a balance. She's becoming very westernized though and the likelihood of ending up with a foreigner becomes substantially higher than the previous category. She doesn't want to admit it to herself just yet and reserves the possibility that she'll end up with a traditional Chinese guy. Because she's so westernized though she'll find out that her views on life and how it should be lived might be too different from the classical Chinese life. He wont understand her, and she'll start realizing how far she's grown away from tradition.   Full Foreigner Girl, this girl will only hangout with foreigners and at times even despise Chinese guys. She might have psychological issues that feed this unhealthy obsession and rebellion against the established culture around her. This kind of girl is very open minded and can sometimes be really slutty. She's the epitome of what Chinese guys hate about girls that like foreigners.   There are countless categories in between but these are a few reference markers, I personally love Chinese/South Korean girls (although the Korean ones are more difficult to relate to than the Chinese). I used to never think about them before coming to the country but my god did I get yellow fever when I came here. Beijing woman in general are more gritty then in other places around the country, they have direct humor and are sum preddy strong independent wymyn.   If you're talking about hooking up I suggest going to clubs in Wudaokou, there is a hotel right next to ""barstreet"" as we call it. I'm not sure how skilled you are at picking up but its definitely possible, iv done it multiple times and had a lot of fun.  I know that if a Chinese man were to read this he would be boiling with rage, but when I see Chinese girls my blood just gets pumpin.   不好意思先生， 我不是故意的我忍不住了 :3  Anyway, my wife is almost certainly going to be Asian, they grow up to be very good mothers and wives I think. 加油！"
China,3dfjpl,komnenos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:21:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great reply!  So what were your first few weeks at BLCU like?  Also how is the year long class different from the other classes?  I signed up for the year long class but can't find any syllabus online, are the classes 20 or 30 hours a week?  And how long did you stay in Tsinghua?  I'm hoping to have mostly Chinese friends while I'm out there, I already have a few Chinese buddies (including my BFF) at Renmin and in the foreign service so its a start.    Are there sports clubs in BLCU?  I've always loved badminton and I'm 6'4 so I can dominate the court and I'm a collegiate runner and would love to make friends on the court or through running.  Haha I just got out of a two and a half year relationship with a fairly traditional Chinese gal so I'm not a complete noob, if anything though I'm looking for a more traditional relationship and less hooking up.  I don't want to be naive but when I was in China last for a month and a half it seemed that being tall and having blond hair and blue eyes went a lot farther than in the PNW."
China,3dfjpl,2akurate,2,Fri Jul 17 13:28:49 2015 UTC,"First weeks in BLCU was not much different from the subsequent weeks, I already knew a lot of people there so I was familiar. The year long classes have elective courses, start at 8:30 as opposed to 8 and I think have fewer hours (of regular Chinese lessons, less intensive). The electives have stuff like ""economics"", ""newspaper reading"" etc... The lower levels might have stuff like ""Chinese songs"", ""calligraphy"", ""history of characters""....  As for sport clubs Im not sure, to me it seemed like people just arranged that stuff themselves, not really ""clubs"" persé.   Yea there's plenty of girls there, I'm quite sure you'll find someone.

If you've never been in China before, or aren't that confident in your Chinese it may be better to scope things out first, have the university take care of you for at least 3 months before you start venturing alone into the wilds."
China,3dfjpl,komnenos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:58:44 2015 UTC,"What were your first few weeks at BLCU like?  I've been to China before but it was only for a month and only spent a week of it in Beijing, whereas now its looking like I'll be staying a year and a half plus.  How did living in Beijing compare to home?  What were your biggest challenges with living in China?  How hard are the classes and how much did most people spend studying after class?  And what was life at BLCU like once you got used to it?  I hope its okay to ask, BLCU's website though nice lacks a personal touch and most of the blogs I've found are pretty old."
China,3dfjpl,metheviewer,2,Thu Jul 16 16:12:21 2015 UTC,"Didn't spend all that much time studying tbh :) The classes are fine, you'll do a placement test to determine your level with options to skip ahead/go ahead. I'm from Cape Town which is pretty much just tourism and wine, so of course Beijing was really different. The only thing that got me down was the air quality and quality of the dairy and produce. It's easy to make friends, who you'll spend tons of time partying with, you'll be in Wudaokou, so foreigner friendly Chinese people will interact with you in places where the staff speak enough English to take an order."
China,3dfjpl,komnenos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:27:21 2015 UTC,"How good was your Mandarin after your year studying/partying?  Any interesting stories?  How hard was it for you to go out with the Chinese?  How many Chinese friends did you make while over there?  And when the heck can you apply for housing?  Where did you end up staying?    Sorry, hope its okay to ask these questions. :P  And if there is anything else that you'd like to tell me about your time at BLCU I'd love to hear about it!"
China,3dfjpl,metheviewer,2,Fri Jul 17 15:44:36 2015 UTC,"Made a lot of Chinese friends, it improved daily but still was only about  intermediate level. Really did party quite hard, started hanging out with some diaosi kids with relatives in the party who'd literally just get wasted, eat and pretend to be dj's. I stopped hanging out with them after I realised I was doing way too much drugs. It was an educational experience though.  The problem with making Chinese friends is that good girls and boys don't go to bars, so I find it hard to find common ground. The only friends I have that I met going out are all well over 30. You'll also meet a lot of people who want to be your ""friend"" just because you're a foreigner who can speak Chinese and will give them face. But 20-something guys who only want to do stuff like watching movies and walking the in the park is a bit weird for me.  My Chinese didn't really get to a level where I'm comfortable taking care of everything myself until my third year in China. I'd also studied at home for three years before coming to China. I met kids who came to China with no ability who could speak just as well after studying in country for 6 months, as I did after studying abroad for years. So I think rapid advancement, especially with the 速成汉语 courses, is completely possible (4-6 hours a day, only chinese language), but again book learning is not always the same as reality.  My advice to you would just be to enjoy yourself. My year in BLCU was one of the best of my life. You'll be meeting people from all over the world, everyone's young and wants to have fun, you'll probably be getting laid more than ever. Just mind the fake alcohol at the all you can drink for xRMB places and you should be fine. Seriously though, stay away from fake alcohol, it fucks you up really badly, and the hangovers are unreal.  Also you don't ""apply"" for housing, register at uni and stay in the dorms until you get your bearings, then it's on you if you want private accommodation. You'll also need enough cash to put down 3 months deposit, then just stop paying for your dorm and tell them you've moved. But bring the proof of residency paper you got with your landlord at the police station."

Some relocated staff get sweet deals where they can send their kids to international schools, and live in plush suburbs like the Shunyi colony outside Beijing, where you're pretty much sheltered from China.

China,3dfjpl,Individual99991,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:45:37 2015 UTC,"Do you know which city you'd be moving to?  Check that your mother's company is going to pay for your to go to an international school. You do NOT want to get involved in the Chinese educational system as it's utterly dysfunctional and basically worthless in both an educational sense and in the wider world.  In all likeliness you would be going to an international school, though.  It's hard to say how different life would be as I don't know your life right now. But if you're in an international school you'll be taught in Western-style classrooms by Western teachers (or Chinese people with great English), and most likely have all the support and tech you'd need.   Your classmates will be from all over the world, including other Americans, but thankfully US media is so ubiquitous that you'll probably all have the same cultural touchstones so there shouldn't be too many issues with making friends. Plus, you'll almost all be in the same position of having been brought to the country by foreign parents, so you're all in the same boat.  If they're forking out for an international school, they'll probably also house you in a gated community with practically everything you'll need on a day-to-day basis. Shunyi, the part of Beijing that's used for this purpose, basically looks like a random Western suburb, and nothing like the rest of Beijing.   Don't worry about speaking Mandarin - get 3G and a smartphone and you'll have apps for just about every occasion. Buy a VPN that works on your smartphone too (Astrill is the one I'd recommend) before you come to China so you can access Twitter etc. It'll be easier if you get an iPhone as Google Store is blocked on the mainland, making it hard to download new apps.  Still, if you are coming out here you should make the effort to learn before you fly (you'll probably learn Mandarin as a second language at school the way you'd learn Spanish in the US, but a head start is recommended). Remember that unlike Spanish, French etc it has absolutely no (well, very few) connection with English, so when you start learning you will be at the level of a baby. However, it's not as hard as people say - it's totally doable even if it takes a LONG time to master - and if you can learn any other language, you can learn Mandarin.   Basically, so long as you don't expect it to be the same as moving to the next town over, life here will be totally fine - and, I would argue, an amazing experience that will change your life in entirely positive ways."

China,3dgfou,holyevilcow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:31:54 2015 UTC,"Downloaded from shady websites that obtain stolen copies of these movies from Hong Kong and Taiwan, which usually have release dates more in line with the States.  And movies are not day 1 released on chinese websites.  Even so, if you wanted a quality release you'd torrent it since Youku and iQiyi have crap video quality, but personally I like to go to the theater to watch if the movie isn't censored too much."

Or go with it and have decent pictures and someone telling all their friends how nice foreigners are. Either way the picture will be taken. They never use the blurry creepshot when they have a nice selfie with you to use.  I've found to take some pleasure in the later option- run through the poses; shaking hands, making a muscle with the skinny Chinese dude, put the kid on my shoulders. Takes 20 seconds max and they are so happy you can't help but smile a bit too.  If you are here for the long haul you need to just embrace some stuff.

Not really too many regrets, but wished some things would have happened that never materialized.   Being married you realize how much people cheat constantly and how easy it is. Not that being in the USA will change it, but the temptation will be a fraction of what it is here in China.   A lot of the expats here in China just have absolutely no morals. People I really respected told me to just go cheat on my wife when she was out of the country. Not just talking about the expat men either...  anyways, we are just trying to soak up the time we have left and still looking for new things to do. One of the things I considered when coming to China was ""when I have kids one day, I'll tell him to chase after his dreams and take risks.""  I was hesitant to come to China but I had wanted to come for 7 years and turned down a good job to come here. Now I have a kid and as of the fall, he will have been to 7 countries before turning 18 months old. Sure he won't remember but when he's globetrotting and kicking ass later in life, he's gonna love seeing his baby photos."
China,3ddf1x,malariasucks,3,Wed Jul 15 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"That's a good point.  Once you have a good job back where you're from, it makes China a lot less appealing.  Life is so much more stable and efficient in at least where I'm from.    Also I hear you on morals.  I'm not particularly religious, but the worst kind of foreigner just expected to be applauded on doing whatever they wanted, and not be judged at all which really made me wonder if this is a place I was proud to be.  I've seen ruined marriages, people in jail, friends doing HK runs monthly staying in hostels and begging to be let back in.  If they were denied a ""tourist"" visa and spent all their RMB on beer, street food, and borrowed money for a ticket home all they left was a bad memory of China.  People like this just dissolved, and it was like they were never here.     If a miracle happened and fought to get back into China tooth and nail and if they came back learned nothing from the harrowing experience.  More beer, and let's all laugh at the other foreigner doing worse things that me.  It gets tiring to see this year after year.  I separated from certain groups, and became really suspicious of a certain type of foreigner.    Really, if you think about it objectively, this is a very, very weird  place.  Fond memories for sure of certain things, but it's more trouble than it's worth."

I did have some strong feelings on my last day at work; inputting the last bit of paper work and saying goodbye to everyone for the last time was fine.  It was when I got in my car to drive home from work for the last time that it finally hit me that a major part of my life was over for good, and that things would never be the same again.  I actually really loved my job so I can't help but have mixed feelings that it's over.  I still have a lot of stuff to take care of before going back to Canada though.  Have to wait for my wife's immigration visa, have to sell the car and the house, have to worry about getting my cats back to Canada.  I suspect that I'll be so worried about the cats that I won't really feel much until we're all safely in Canada.  And once we get to Canada there's a lot of work in buying a new house, a new car, setting up my wife's business, our insurance, all that jazz.

Making sure you get your security deposit back, and that your former boss will write you that letter of recommendation that you need.  I'm a pretty proactive person, but for a country of people that consistently wait to the last minute for important things it's maddening to deal with the last hours to make sure your flight is reimbursed correctly and HR did mess it up.  I didn't trust HR especially then, and I don't trust it now.    When the day hits, making sure you have your passport with you, can you get the stuff into 100 lbs/person and finally did the car service we ordered show up on time?  Will my extra luggage make it to the US in one piece?  No longer can you laugh and say 'oh....China' because so much is dependent on that flight and you making it with all your stuff that you need.  Once your contract is filled you no longer have a visa, or even enough RMB in your Chinese account to last another week so this all better work.  Honestly I've never had a job where the responsibilities were so carefree to the amount of money I made.   After a year, my wife and I are quite happy in America.  Really in America the people are kind, friendly, and go out of their way to help you.  The jobs my wife and I have don't save as much, and sure are a lot more stressful with legitimate performance reviews and office politics.

China,3ddf1x,twtaipeii,3,Thu Jul 16 06:16:23 2015 UTC,"Well four years was enough for me.  Eight years was more than enough for my wife that I met there.  We had excellent health insurance but the thought of raising a kid was an unsettling thought.  Spotty health care and international schools provide a great education, but they are quite expensive.    For the foreign population I personally I got sick of making new friends every year, which was always fueled with hangovers that wasted the next day.  Even worse was the oneupmanship that came with a new group of friends.  Either they thought I was better...how can I get your job? or I'm better than you because blah blah blah and a stupid smirk.   It just made me sick of the whole experience of the foreigner superiority thing.  After a while, I had a decent set of Chinese friends, but it was the standard 'let's hotpot and KTV' and uncomfortably fight over the bill.  It really wasn't 'fun' as I wanted to have it.  There wasn't much variations to the same theme hotpot/KTV.  Sometimes you really want quality conversations of a dinner party or someone to play Xbox with  or watch movies or interesting TV shows and talk about them.    My wife was sick of the pollution and wearing air masks.  She was also sick of the lack of efficiency and it ruined our day if someone made a mistake they wouldn't own up to it and actually do something about it.  We would have to fix it for them, or work around the system.  On a Saturday we would have 10 errands to do, but realistically because of China we could only get 3 or 4 done.  It got frustrating, and just wore you down. Why in China do you have to wait 2 hours for a Bank transaction?  Why can't I trust a Chinese person when they smile when I ask them where's my passport because I need to travel after renewing my visa?  So after a while, we made a decision.  Get our money out, and we're quite happy we did."

I actually don't think I'll miss Beijing, although maybe I will after I leave. There was just too much nonsense to put up with constantly and I don't think things will improve too much, so I don't regret my choice. I've been here for over 2 years, which is slightly shorter than what I had intended.   It's been mixed during my time here. In terms of money and work, I did alright whereas in romance, nothing. Enjoyed a few intimate experiences but didn't last long. I came to China with a really positive attitude and will come out as a major cynic. However I think I've developed a greater appreciation for things like clean environment (the air actually isn't the most polluted thing here), manners, uncensored and fast Internet and just being in a society where not every form of interaction is filled with rudeness or deceit. Where I'm from, HK, people are incredibly materialistic and sometimes rude too, but mainland Chinese take it to a whole new leave.  I know a lot of people had good experiences and a lot of fun in China but I didn't come to China for fun nor did I indulge in a lot of it. Maybe that was a big mistake."

I applied to a Chinese company from the EU, but at no stage did anyone handle anything original other than my passport. I did the physical exam in China - everyone agreed that doing it overseas is a waste of time and money as you will likely have to do another exam in China.

I was also told that I needed the original diploma (which I think comes from the way higher ed is done in China). You may be able to use a high quality full size scan.

China,3dcywm,iVarun,7,Thu Jul 16 05:47:39 2015 UTC,"A major reservoir supplying drinking water to Beijing and many other cities in northern China has been found to contain heavy metal pollutants at levels far above safe standards, according to a new study by mainland Chinese scientists.  Levels of lead in the Danjiangkou reservoir were found to be 20 times the maximum safe level set by the World Health Organisation, at more than 200 micrograms per litre, a 20-fold increase from 2007 to 2010, the researchers found.  The news comes in the same weak researchers in Hong Kong found ""excessive"" levels of lead in the drinking water of some public housing estates.   The WHO standard for a safe level of lead in a surface water source is 10 micrograms per litre. The maximum level regarded as safe by the United States Environmental Protection Agency is 15 micrograms. China's own national surface water quality standards call for levels to remain under 50 micrograms.  The study, published in the peer reviewed Journal of Environmental Informatics, found that levels of lead in the reservoir outstripped all of these guidelines.  Professor Zhang Quanfa, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Wuhan Botanical Garden and lead scientist of the long term observation project, declined an interview due to the sensitivity of the issue.  Whether the water from Danjiangkou reservoir was still drinkable “was not a question I am able to answer,” he told the South China Morning Post.  The water from Danjiangkou reservoir, which straddles Henan and Hubei provinces, supplies more than 60 per cent of taps in Beijing, according to the municipal government.  Excessive lead in drinking water can lead to a host of health problems, and can be especially dangerous to infants and children, according to the US EPA.  Lead poisoning can cause delays in physical or mental development with detectable deficits in attention span and learning abilities in children, while in adults the symptoms include kidney problems and increased blood pressure.  It is unclear how the results of the study relate to current drinking water in Beijing. The data collected by the researchers dates back to 2010 and they did not reveal more recent figures.  The water from Danjiangkou also receives extensive treatment at water processing plants before it reaches individual households. The Beijing government said it used advanced technologies and stringent regulations to ensure the quality of drinking water for its residents.  Locals stand atop the Danjiangkou dam. The reservoir is the major supplier of drinking water to Beijing and several other northern Chinese cities. Photo: AFP  The new study, which collected samples from eight locations across the reservoir, found other kinds of pollutants that exceeded safety standards, including arsenic and chromium, which can lead to cancer and skin problems.  The scientists’ findings contradicted assessments of water quality conducted at Danjiangkou by the Chinese government.  The Ministry of Water Resources said last month that the reservoir had been rated Grade 1, meaning lead levels were below 10 micrograms per litre, for more than 70 per cent of the time it has been in use. Lead levels in the reservoir have never fallen below Grade 2 on the national standards, between 10 and 50 micrograms per litre, the ministry said.  The Danjiangkou reservoir held 29 billion tons of water at the end of 2014 with a surface area of around 450 square kilometres. Its dam was 0.8 km downstream of the junction of the Han and Dan rivers in Hubei and Henan.  By the end of last year the government had spent more than 200 billion yuan on the water diversion project with the main canal exceeding 1,400 km in length.  The South-North Water Transfer Project is designed to funnel more than 14 billion tons of water per year from the Yangtze River region to more than 20 large and medium size cities in the north, with Beijing's water supply given top priority.  “Greater efforts must be made to reduce nitrogen, arsenic and lead pollution for water conservation in the reservoir,” the researchers said in their paper.  They said the increased levels of lead may be caused by an increase in vehicle exhaust pollutants in the upper Han river basin area, as well as mining related activities.

China,3ddllq,hayzen77,2,Wed Jul 15 13:08:01 2015 UTC,"you can transfer money out of China from a Chinese account to a foreign account. There's a limit, but you can transfer more if you have records that you paid income tax. It's not very efficient though. Lots of paperwork and time required.  It's probably more economic to transfer a huge lump sum at once, or use the 2 card trick, where someone in your home country uses a UnionPay card to fill up a local account, or get the money out another way. At least there's less paperwork."

China,3ddllq,jamar030303,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:53:36 2015 UTC,That's interesting.  Does the name on the account at ICBC have to have the same name as the overseas credit card?  Or can someone with an ICBC account pay anyone's overseas credit card?  Does online banking send out RMB and then it's converted at the overseas bank?  Or do you select the desired currency first and then transfer it over?
China,3ddllq,jamar030303,2,Thu Jul 16 20:49:08 2015 UTC,"Anyone can pay anyone else's card from ICBC online banking. There are just the three countries prohibited, and the 0.6% fee, minimum 60RMB.

We want to put her in the same private kindergarden as our older daughter attended, and just finished this past June, however, todays 3 year-old Chinese children are 'Dragon babies' (born in the year of the Dragon) and since the Chinese are supersticious as all Hell, (no wonder Mao wanted to bash the old culture out of their little nong brains) The people here think that Dragon people are the best people so they aim to have their one child during that year. Of coarse it backfires on the poor dumb nongs every 12 years, because the poor kid ends up being in the most crowded classes, and have the most compition of every other aged kid to get into university, and then their first year out of school, they will have the most compatiotion for new jobs.

There's a slight chance that they're following some semi-classified directive regarding minority policy and missionaries (Yunnan, for instance, has a lot of quirky interpretations on foreigner laws based on this logic), but again the only way to find out is to get a set of eyes and ears on it in the capital."

They bang on about the hukou system as if that was all set up to rig tests.  And I think this paragraph says it all:  Whenever an American or European wins an Olympic gold medal, we cheer them as heroes,"" OECD's education chief and special adviser Andreas Schleicher said recently.

Washington Post: “How overblown is impossible to say, but we can conjecture, with an example about the way Shanghai’s results might be skewed.”  The key word here is 'Conjecture'.  From the same article: ""We recognize that Shanghai’s schools are still outperforming our best school system on PISA, even after filtering out the lowest-performing schools in Massachusetts.""  Their main argument is that migrant kid's are not allowed attend certain schools in Shanghai.  That's a problem with the Hukou system and not an attempt to rig the math tests.  SMCP: ""As Schleicher and his colleagues have patiently explained in public, the Chinese have not been cheating in Pisa. Instead, it seems that many educational and economic policy authorities in the West are cheating themselves.""  Schleicher is the PISA test organiser and not some Chinese government Shill.

China,3dcgdg,kanada_kid,5,Wed Jul 15 12:24:02 2015 UTC,"He's right, but this has nothing to do with race, instead it is cultural and an indirect result of bad policies (relative to one's point of view). The Confucian mind favors family at the expense of everyone else. Lying, cheating of screwing strangers is acceptable as long it benefits you and your relatives. Schools principals in China command their staff to ""inflate"" grades in order to appear better than they are. In China, the principal is directly responsible for the school, in public education principals can be promoted or sacked according to their results, just like officials. In short, a good school means a good principal. A good principal might be promoted to work, let's say at the education bureau, where he can collect even more bribes and benefit his family. Fake ""inflated"" grades are not to be blamed on the government, at least not directly, they are more like an indirect result of their policy and the lack of serious checks from the education bureau means that principals get away with it. It has nothing to do with race, Hong Kong doesn't do it, nor does Singapore, Taiwan is clean on that point, they are all countries with a majority of Han Chinese. The difference with Mainland China is, these countries enforce laws and corruption if there is doesn't go beyond closed political circles."

There's some disagreement about whether it's better to apply as someone's SO, or just independently through a travel agency. An American spouse or boyfriend may help to establish stability and ties to China (if the American is in China long-term), but can also hurt the application, because technically you can just go to the states, get married, and petition for a greencard right there.  I'd say for her situation, if you guys aren't married yet, she'd probably have the best chances applying through a travel agency. The visa is the same as an individual tourist, so there will be no issues at the border when she shows up alone.  Also, being turned down for a US visa doesn't hurt your prospects in the future, unless you are rejected for attempting to mislead the visa officers (filing fraudulent bank records, etc.)"

China,3dbzup,castlerocktronics,5,Wed Jul 15 07:51:25 2015 UTC,"“YEAH, the Chinese can take a test, but…they’re not terribly imaginative. They’re not entrepreneurial. They don’t innovate—that’s why they’re stealing our intellectual property.” So declared Carly Fiorina, a former boss of Hewlett-Packard, shortly before announcing her candidacy for America’s presidency earlier this year. Ms Fiorina’s provocation fuelled a global debate over one of the big business questions of the age: can China innovate?  Sceptics make two arguments. They point to the historically lax protection of intellectual-property (IP) rights and the proliferation of copycat business models in China as evidence that Chinese companies cannot create for themselves. An article published in MIT Sloan Management Review last year claimed that Chinese theft of IP costs American firms $300 billion a year. Nay-sayers also argue that the heavy-handed approach taken by China’s government to promoting innovation is in fact retarding it.  Two new publications bang the drum for the opposite side of this debate. “The China Effect on Global Innovation”, a study by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), the think-tank of the eponymous consulting firm, argues that Chinese companies do indeed show promise. MGI does not fall into the common trap of conflating innovation with invention: “The proof of successful innovation is the ability of companies to expand revenue and raise profits,” as opposed to filing lots of patents that never get used, or releasing a stream of novelty products that fail to generate a return. And “China’s Disruptors”, a book out on July 14th, by Edward Tse, a management consultant, argues that China’s dynamic private sector has risen with the help of, not despite, government policies on innovation.  The MGI team scrutinised financial data on 20,000 firms from China and elsewhere, to see if they create value for customers and shareholders. It weighed up the extent to which they do so through such things as basic research, by throwing large numbers of engineers at problems (as firms like Huawei, a telecoms-equipment maker, are good at doing), by improving manufacturing processes, and so on. China has spent years, and large sums of money, trying to be an “innovation sponge” that absorbs foreign technologies. Despite this, notes the MGI report, it still lags the West in creating world-class medicines, civil aircraft and cars.  However, it finds that in many other sectors, China is now taking a global lead in two areas of innovation: in improving consumer products and the business models used to sell them; and in making manufacturing processes cheaper, quicker and better. As a result, Chinese firms now outsell foreign rivals in such things as household appliances, internet software and consumer electronics. They are helped by the fact that their home market is so huge. But they are also fleet of foot. Chinese consumers are ready adopters of smartphones, social media and e-commerce, as well as being value-conscious and brand-licentious. If consumer firms can make it in China, they can make it anywhere.  Chinese firms are inventing new business models. The West’s online firms generate most of their revenue from advertising. But China’s advertising industry is only about one-eighth the size of America’s, so Chinese digital firms have had to find new ways to monetise their users’ eyeballs. Tencent generates 90% of its revenue from online games, sales of virtual items on social platforms and e-commerce. Average revenue per user in 2014 was $16, which was $6 more than Facebook. YY.com, an online-video platform, lets viewers buy electronic “roses” to shower upon video artists whose shows they enjoyed. YY says its top performers, who get a cut of the revenue, can earn more than 20,000 yuan ($3,200) a month, seven times the average factory worker’s pay.  What about the other argument, on the role of the state? The pessimists argue that China’s bureaucrats are bad for private-sector innovation. In a sense Mr Tse is an unlikely person to be challenging this view. He was the top China man for the Boston Consulting Group and then for Booz & Company (two rival consulting outfits). His book chronicles in compelling detail the rise of the mainland’s entrepreneurial economy from the ashes of Maoist policies. And yet this arch-capitalist insists that, “Companies alone cannot make the massive long-term commitment of resources needed to drive innovation in many crucial areas.” Just as American public spending on universities and defence research boosted Silicon Valley’s early stars like HP, in China too, “the state has to lead the way.” He is encouraged by the fact that China now spends more than $200 billion a year on research and development (public and private), putting it above the European Union as a proportion of GDP, though still behind America.  Mr Tse also points to evidence that, he argues, shows how China’s regulatory and legal infrastructure is becoming more “innovation-friendly”. Baidu, China’s biggest internet-search firm, used to be notorious for hosting pirated music and videos. Thanks to regulatory crackdowns and legal challenges from rights holders, it has cleaned up its act and has become a big, legitimate distributor of foreign TV shows.  Setting the stage Ms Fiorina is right that most Chinese firms are not at the cutting-edge of technology, but she is wrong to say they are incapable of value-creating innovation. HP itself has been overtaken by Lenovo of China as the world’s leading computer-maker, helped not just by its bold acquisitions of Western businesses but by its impressive in-house product development. And Mr Tse is right that there is a role for government in setting the stage for innovation. However, in civil aviation and carmaking, the government is also dictating the structure of the industry: in planes, through a state-owned national champion, AVIC; and in cars, via forced partnerships with foreign firms. Chinese firms can innovate. But its government has not yet learned to distinguish between helpful support and counter-productive meddling."

China,3db2yk,ulenie,21,Tue Jul 14 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, when I finished writing this I had no idea how long it had gotten. Coffee is as coffee does.   Most of the answers you are getting are not very good. I am not going to dig too deeply into my old Kindle notes, so I have very few figures or statistics for you, but the general idea runs kind of like this:  Firstly, Republican China was not totally bereft of capital. There were significant industrial centers in northeastern China, the Yangtze river delta, and the Pearl river delta. Despite the horrors of war, famine, and international competition, a significant rural proto-industrial (handicrafts mostly) sector never ceased to exist in the countryside. Obviously, agricultural production was pretty much continuous. You also see China's first major railways, industrial ports, etc.   Secondly, there was a significant amount of capital accumulation during the Maoist period. Between Liberation in 1949 and Mao's death in 1978, GDP growth averaged somewhere between 2% and 6% (no good data). State-led industrial policy superintended a higher and higher share of national income accruing to modern industry, so the rate of industrial growth was obviously higher than the rate of economic growth (2-6%) generally.  New high-yielding seed varieties and large agricultural infrastructural projects led to gains in agricultural productivity and output. The state undertook other sorts of infrastructural projects with respect to the transportation and communication systems, which increased the capital stock. Some commentators argue that the most important contribution of the Maoist period to China's economic development concerns huge state-led investments in human capital which are observed in (miraculously) improved rates of literacy, life expectancy, infant mortality, etc. (It was only in the 1980s that this huge capital stock began being exploited in an efficient manner consistent with virtuous and rapid economic growth.)   Thirdly, the gradual imposition of systems of market exchange throughout the 1980s led to a veritable boom in rural industrial economic activity. The centerpiece of this process was the Town and Village Enterprise (TVE). TVEs were, theoretically, companies owned by the local government (they were often privately operated but officially registered as state-owned, TIC). They were doing things like making textiles, smelting, transporting goods, or whatever. They were completely Chinese affairs, sourcing their inputs from Chinese suppliers, producing commodities using Chinese labor, and selling it to little old ladies down the way. These were the basis of China's industrial takeoff in the 1980s. By the 1990s something like 250+ million Chinese were employed in TVEs (this share of of employment has since pretty much collapsed with the rise of the export oriented sector).   Fourthly, it's only in the late 1980s and 1990s the you start seeing the huge, structurally transformative inflows of FDI. This flow first starts coming in from the Chinese diaspora in places like HK, Singapore, Taiwan, etc, and in the 1990s you start seeing the Euro-Americans, Japanese, etc, starting to do the heavy lifting.   Finally, smart people like Pomeranz argue that China's economic miracle has its deep roots in the imperial past. China has always been a commercially dynamic society with a significant capital stock; has always enjoyed an intensive and relatively efficient agrarian system; has always invested heavily in infrastructure; has always enjoyed a complex division of labor. The Chinese miracle is not so far removed from it's pre-modern past -- it is the hundred years between the Taiping Rebellion and the death of Mao that is the aberration. Personally, I find this approach a bit too impressionistic and nebulous, but most of the best sinologists buy some version of it.

So the basic source of china's capital is bank deposits.  Those banks funneled that money into SOEs through loans. This dynamic has continued for the last 30 years...  The problem is, the SOEs don't like to pay back the banks and Beijing doesn't make them because they want the SOEs to be strong. So every five years or so Beijing bails out the banks who are drowning in non performing loans. So the true basis of china's capital now is sovereign debt and asset management corporations who are treated as assets despite owning nothing but non performing loans that the government never asked the SOEs to repay.  The sheer amount of NPLs and the way they are treated on balance sheets is the biggest issue facing China. The big banks would be insolvent if they followed western accounting practices. When people start asking where the money is and how the debts will be repaid, China is boned."

The big banks would be insolvent if they followed western accounting practices. When people start asking where the money is and how the debts will be repaid, China is boned.   Ya, sorry but this is hyperbole.    The NPL ratio for China is around 1%  1.6% if stretched to everything    If others with worse financial metrics in the neighborhood(check NPL ratio's for other countries) can survive/move along so can China.   And no, Banks in China and India and many other Asian countries often use better practices than Western Banks. These banks are backed up with huge capital ratio's and loans/credits are often much harder to get. In fact these rules are often growth inhibitors more than they are doomsday devices. Which is why apart from the Interest rate cuts the first thing Central Banks of these countries do is tamper with the CRR, because its effective and because they have massive amounts of room to tamper with this metric.."
China,3db2yk,justinchina,2,Wed Jul 15 06:40:26 2015 UTC,"China's non performing loans might seem low because every few years they take them all off the books and create new asset management companies that the banks invest in and list as assets. Even then, the ratio is far above 1%.   http://english.caijing.com.cn/2011-06-22/110753514.html  This article from the highly respected caijing says it could be as high as 15% for loans since 2009.  The central government is currently shitting its pants wondering what to do with several trillion yuan in bad loans they've aimed from local government financing vehicles."
China,3db2yk,marksnangles,-1,Wed Jul 15 07:07:21 2015 UTC,"The article is 4 years old. Even by Western standards its a long time, by Chinese standards its even more.    15% is an absurdly high figure, its not been corroborated by anyone else.    Plus, China is not the only one who does these AMC restructuring. Some use different mechanisms but the principle is the same that is keep the Banks safe (which is the often most important thing for such countries) and extend the time frame for the loans to sort itself out. Only if the overall economy fails does the above strategy fail and since that is not happening the NPL (even if taken at its worse valuation) is not a big deal as of now. Its a concern sure but that list of concerns have a hierarchy and in that its not that high.   World Bank data even if not 100% accurate (nothing ever is) has a good enough margin to make those numbers relatively informative for many of the other countries listed due to the Normalization effect."
China,3db2yk,TheDark1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:36:38 2015 UTC,"I can't explain it eloquently except to say that there's a big problem with the bank using bad loans as security to issue more loans, the banks aren't run as institutions that must make careful decisions, the SOEs use and abuse them.   The PBOC needs to get its house in order and explain where all the debt is and how they're going to ensure bonds are paid on time."
China,3db2yk,marksnangles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:01:58 2015 UTC,you should just start with the second point...first point was pre-poor socialist as per OP's question...
China,3db2yk,JillyPolla,4,Wed Jul 15 03:41:46 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. It looks like OP is under the impression that China went from zero capital to lots of capital starting with Deng, so maybe it is helpful to emphasize the complexity (indeed, vibrancy) of the Chinese economy over the long-run without, of course, diminishing the miraculous boom of the last couple decades. That was also why I brought up the Pomeranz book."
China,3db2yk,TheDark1,3,Wed Jul 15 03:46:58 2015 UTC,"There was an anecdote in red capitalism about when deng and his people wanted to go to the UN and they had to scour every bank in Beijing to come up with the 40,000 dollars necessary to do so. At the end of the cultural revolution china was almost completely bankrupt and there wasn't a properly functioning bank in the country."
China,3db2yk,marksnangles,4,Wed Jul 15 04:13:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting anecdote; I had never heard that one before. On the contrary, though, the Bramall book argues that GDP during the cultural revolution decade increased at a pretty consistent clip  and that it was China's best decade under Mao with respect to human development (which can be interpreted as a form of capital accumulation).   Perhaps one or the other proposition is just false. Alternatively, perhaps we can square them if we assume (demonstrate? I can't! haha) that banks did not play the same role within the broader economy as they do in, say, the US, where a  major bank failure is catastrophic with respect to the functioning of the system as a whole. Maybe the Chinese socialist economy was structured such that you could see real growth and real gains in primary schooling without functioning banks in the vicinity of ZhongNanHai. No idea!"

China,3db2yk,justinchina,0,Wed Jul 15 04:49:46 2015 UTC,Well I'm not sure how they are measuring this gdp growth. Does it just mean they were growing more crops? And how does it stack against population growth?
China,3db2yk,notthatintothis,4,Wed Jul 15 05:03:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm heading out the door so I can't give a very comprehensive answer, but I was also curious about this so I glanced back at the Bramall book (pg 292) and you can have a look at the data sets he's using. Depending on the data set, and whether you use 1990 prices or 1952 prices, GDP growth  between 1963 (which is immediately after the Great Famine, mind you) and 1978 was somewhere between 5.1% and 7.5% per year. GDP growth per capita for the same period is between 2.6% and 5.0%. The higher figures reflect the 1952 prices, which Bramall thinks make more sense because they better reflect consumer preferences during the time period he is looking at.   The gdp stats presumably reflect growth across all sectors of the economy, particularly industry, because we know that industry's share of national income consistently grew during this time.   Whatever data set you use, Bramall thinks that this demonstrates that the Chinese economic record during this time period was not the ""catastrophe"" portrayed by a lot of sources, but also nothing close to the epic booms going on in capitalist Japan, SK, TW, etc. Not so bad, not so amazing, but certainly interesting."

China,3db2yk,laowailaoshistyle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:08:08 2015 UTC,"It doesn't need an infusion of capital because capital was created and built upon itself. The capital was the people and their labor potential that was unleashed by market freedom.  Capital is not some finite resource like the total amount of water on earth. It's infinite in the sense that its only limit is that of our ingenuity and hard work.  I think your question stems from a misunderstanding of how capitalism works. It's not like you have $100 and it has to be moved from somewhere else and everyone shares that set capital. When you build something that's capital. When you put together a product that's capital. When you come up with an idea that's capital. The pie is always getting larger unless there's something like a war and all the capital is destroyed by bombs or taken through taxes and then literally lit on fire when you use ammunition in guns.  China was communist. That means taxes are at 100% and then everything is redistributed after the ruling class gets their cut. There is no capital accumulation when everything you earn is taken away from you. This is why taxes at any level are bad, it reduces capital accumulation and in areas where services do need to be provided they are provided much less efficiently by government and this also slows down capital accumulation because things are done less efficiently.  The goal is to do the most things with the least amount of resources. Government is bad at that. You can't have new technologies and new factories when everything is confiscated as soon as you earn it in a communist system. How are you supposed to build anything when you own nothing to begin with and everything belongs collectively to ""society""?  China boomed because they finally let the market run free and people keep and accumulate the fruits of their labor."

The factory is destroyed and everyone stays poor.  China is different because, like the US government, their central government is structured in a way to not let majority rule simply dictate resource redistribution and capital destruction. If 51% of people want to burn the factories too bad because it's not happening. Everything isn't done on popular opinion. When things are done based on popular opinion you get something like Greece where there is a slow and steady death spiral.  China also has a strong government. They have the military and police resources to enforce the rule of law and put down competing governments that might pop up within their borders."

China,3db2yk,TheDark1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:44:44 2015 UTC,I'm not though because saving implies that you're throwing resources in a hole to be consumed later. In capitalism resources are actively used to build more resources and they aren't always consumed in the process. I'm using a more specific description to get the point across about how capital is used.
China,3db2yk,xuankun,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:34:45 2015 UTC,The standard macroeconomic equation is savings = investment.
China,3db2yk,derethor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:44:16 2015 UTC,"I know this. The poster of the question might not be able to make this subtle distinction. When you say saving people imagine a squirrel hiding his nuts for winter. When you say capital accumulation you visualize a building which is used to produce building materials for more buildings like it to be built. It's a process of compounding capital on top of capital.  But yes, savings does equal investment."
China,3db2yk,xiefeilaga,0,Wed Jul 15 14:50:35 2015 UTC,"A general answer, without knowing how it works exactly, is that multinational corporations, along with governments, UN, and NGO's, invested the money and technological resources after China decided to allow it during the diplomatic relations with the West at the end of Mao's life and into Deng's opening. One of the things China conceded to the West was the 1 child policy. One of the things they received was all their technical people were trained in Western institutions so they could begin to build.   This is an extremely limited synopsis, but the MNC's were very happy to begin moving their factories out of places where human and worker's rights had naturally developed alongside technology and get the factories into a place where the development of either rights or technology had not occurred naturally, and so China could be used as a base to manufacture without unions and probably to bring in more robotics in a society where there was no way to resist. Now that worker's rights have been elevated to the barest minimum of turn of the century levels, the factories are mostly automating and/or fleeing to lesser developed countries.   Wal-Mart and the low-profit-margin way of life wins."

The books are more focused on passing an exam, which for some people makes it easier to pass. You can find the book on Chinese Amazon, search HSK 1 hanban."

If you were learning English, you'd learn the alphabet first, right? Heisig's book takes the same approach. #  Once you've done that (and you're looking at months, not days) then you need to get your tones right. This is really, really crucial. Hire a tutor, go to classes, whatever it takes. No book can help you avoid this.  You'll then do best by carrying on with classes and using whatever textbook the teacher recommends. The point of learning a language is to communicate! But if you want to really engage full-on with how the language works, the have a try at Chinese Language Skills for Britain. It's material from a research project at Oxford University students. It's brutal. None of this ""Hello David, ni hao Xiao Wang"" stuff; you read a Chinese newspaper article in the first lesson. If you put the work in, you'll learn a lot. It helps if you'd consider yourself Oxbridge material.  For the rest of us, you could try Teach Yourself Chinese. I used an earlier edition and found it one of the better books.  # This is a novel approach in Mandarin because Heisig only published his Chinese book a few years ago. The Japanese equivalent came out in the 70s and is now one of the standard ways to learn that language."

China,3d8gyg,incredibleman,7,Tue Jul 14 12:11:42 2015 UTC,"Retirement plan might account for a large portion of that.  $1m USD is ca. 650k GBP. Here in the UK that would buy you an annuity paying you the equivalent of an average salary for your pension.  If you pay into a pension for 45 years, $12k/year paid in, an average return of only 2.5% will bring you to the $1m mark by retirement age. If you average 3% you only need to put in about $10,500. If you average 4% return, you only need to put in about $8,000.  In many countries there are very substantial tax breaks on pension payments, so the actual cost is even lower. While those amounts are high for low earners even in the US, a substantial proportion of people pay in at those levels."
China,3d8gyg,rubygeek,2,Tue Jul 14 12:58:35 2015 UTC,"I have no statistics on this, but judging on the lifestyle of almost every senior citizen I know in Canada, very few people put enough commitment into saving for retirement."
China,3d8gyg,Nefelia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:00:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the proportion who does is small, but consider that with an average life expectancy of around 80, it's reasonable to assume that at least 15% of the population is above retirement age. In the US that would mean about 45 million people. If only 1% of those set aside $1m over their entire working life and go on to live of the returns rather than eat into the principal, that's 450,000 ""retirement millionaires"" right there.   If 10% did, then that would be all the millionaires in the US, which it obviously isn't, so clearly the number of people setting aside this much for pensions is a very small proportion.  It'd be interesting to know how large proportion of millionaires they make up, though, as a fairly substantial (but still minority) proportion could afford to save up $1m by retirement if they really wanted to.   It does kinda bring home just how much of a hockeystick the wealth curve is, in any case.."

I love how this person wrote an essay on why this girl gets a lot of attention on the social media, and how she looks youthful and cute etc, and the implication for Chinese culture and critical analysis of Chinese history blah blah. Cuz as we all know, American social media never gives attention to good looking women, and American society have no preference for youthfulness in women, and that women don't try to look as youthful as possible."
China,3da8t8,JillyPolla,5,Tue Jul 14 19:49:48 2015 UTC,Well put. The author is just trying to make it seem he had good intentions rather than wanting to whack off at the girl. The whole write-up is ridiculous.

If you want basil, get a pot and grow your own :). Then I add some ground beef, and if I feel lazy I add some pre-made sauce to it. My secret trick is to add some soy sauce. But the good thing about pasta sauce is that you can be creative with them.  When adding some pre-made sauce as base you can get away with cooking it quickly on a gas stove.  In the winter I cook huge pots of Gulyas; It's a great dish because it gets better the more often you reheat it, and with some Sichuan peppers it gets a very special kick :)"

Fries should be straightforward enough, bake em or fry em, but the garlic mayonnaise is about half a cup of mayonnaise with 2 cloves of pureed garlic, and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Let it settle in the fridge for a while before using. You can keep it for a week. Sweet potatoes should be like a kuai or a wumao each, mayonnaise 10 kuai for a jar (kewpie). Oil, salt, and garlic you should just always have. This with a bit of salad and a chicken breast is awesome and healthy enough not to feel guilty."
China,3d8k4e,Sasselhoff,2,Tue Jul 14 13:16:39 2015 UTC,"Learn how to bake and get a little oven... Not too small though. And it needs to have an actual thermostat. I taught myself how to make pizza from scratch ( dough and sauce) and it's probably the best pizza you'll find in China. Echoing another suggestion, get a slow cooker pre crock pot or pressure cooker or whatever you call them. I make chicken and veg soup, Italian style tomato soup, English beef soup, thai curries, etc etc. All of which is pretty simple with things you can find in any supermarket, except possibly the thai curry seasonings, but you can find Mccormicks yellow curry paste pretty much everywhere."

A lot of bread in China is sweater than in the USA but the Bimbo bread is decent, and a lot of the whole wheat breads are less sweet.  Bacon is also kind of sweet for whatever reason, seems more like ham.  But overall the difference isn't that bad, and having some bacon grease to make fried rice or other simple dishes can remind me of home."

China,3d8k4e,chocolatechoux,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:23:03 2015 UTC,"Omelette.    Put some oil in a pan.    Fry up some diced purple onion, cherry tomato halves, sliced mushroom, sliced long bright green kinda-spicy pepper, and chopped cilantro on a medium-low heat.  Add the cilantro about two-thirds of the way through.  After they're nice and cooked, stick them to the side.   Beat a few eggs in a dish chaofan style and pour it in the pan.  Let it start to get a little hard then toss your veggies on with a little salt and pepper.  Start flipping your egg in half and practicing your omelette flipping ninja skills.  This is all remarkably cheap.  Bonus: make your way to a Carrefour for some sharp yummy cheese of your choosing.  Shred that up and put it in or on the omelette shortly before removing it from the burner to let it melt.  Bonus 2: Get some Tabasco sauce from amazon.cn for a tasty (American) southwest feel."

Italian recipes... - great soups: broccoli, pumpkin, carrot (depending on whether you make them creamy youll need to buy sour cream, which you can easily get at carrefour)"
China,3d8k4e,Aan2007,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:03:34 2015 UTC,"Pasta is fairly simple. If you can't find tomato sauce you can always hand crush some tomatoes and make it from scratch (channel your inner Italian grandma!). You can find pasta in some super markets and order some parm off the internet. My favorite pasta sauce is just tomato, salt, pepper, sugar, garlic, parm, and shrimp."
China,3d8k4e,jingzi_factory,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:47:35 2015 UTC,"This topic has been discussed plenty of times here and if you search you will find plenty of threads on it.  A lot of what you can make will depend upon what your kitchen has. Not owning things like a rice cooker is foolish IMO, as you can boil anything, make soups, etc. with one, but what you buy is up to you.  Mashed potatoes: You can replace the butter with a little oil and make them like anywhere else. It can be bland to Chinese tastes, so if you have Chinese friends who'll be eating it, you'd best add some corn or bacon or green onion to add a little flavor.  Soups: Takes a little bit of common sense to pair things, but you can fry up most any vegetables and some meat and make a pretty good, healthy and easy to cook meal. I'd always add some onions and potatoes, but some things pair better with different meats, e.g. tomatoes work better with beef.  Deep Fried Anything: If you have the right pots and pans, it can be pretty easy to deep fry most anything. Schnitzel is easy enough to make and well appreciated by most anyone. Apple fritters are similarly easy to make and can be inexpensive.  Spatzle: If you want a different type of noodle this can be easy to make.  You can make anything you want if you're willing to put the time into it and have the right equipment."

China,3d7zl4,TheHenanist,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:50:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, I directed a mental health clinic that the police called in to help with the young under age girls that had been sold into prostitution with the Chinese triads.  I may not know much about foreign affairs and diplomacy, but I have had a lot of experience with this.  Prostitution is savage exploitation of women and human suffering.  If your going to use people that way have the guts to face what your doing to people."
China,3d7zl4,corathus59,5,Tue Jul 14 20:04:35 2015 UTC,"You are making a huge generalization by stating that prostitution is savage exploitation of women. Some forms of prostitution are indeed exploitative, while others simply are not. Thousands of mixed accounts from prostitutes and former prostitutes world wide testify to the hazy nature of the issue.   Regardless, you have more experience with the subject matter than I assumed. Apologies"
China,3d7zl4,TheHenanist,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:20:38 2015 UTC,"I suppose there are very high end prostitutes who might say they are not exploited.  But how many people can ""hire"" a 5,000.00 a night call girl?  99.0% of all prostitution issues from drug addiction, trying to feed kids in the most abject poverty, or being sold into the life by their own family.    On multiple occasions the police would close down a brothel in the town where I worked with that clinic.  Twice they were carpet to carpet Chinese girls, and one was all Korean girls.  We could not get a single one of them to press charges, or to say for the record that they were anything but happy.  Even though they would get an automatic green card due to human trafficking.  If they say how bad the life is their family could be killed.  Trust me that you cannot believe the public statements of folks from this underworld.  You have to be a confidante they trust.  Someone they will talk to off the record."
China,3d7zl4,corathus59,6,Tue Jul 14 20:38:50 2015 UTC,"You assume several things in your recent post:  First: All prostitutes who are not $5,000 a night call girls are exploited.   The levels of contentment expressed by mid to low class prostitutes fall on a broad spectrum. Some enjoy their work, some are ambivalent, some despise it. Just look at the ""iama prostitute"" accounts on reddit if you have any doubt. They are incredibly mixed. Low to mid class prostitutes do not all work under the same, exploitative system. Many prostitutes do not work under the stereotypical male pimp or male dominated criminal networks. Some are independent contractors, some work in female collectives, some work under female dominated systems, some work in structured businesses.    Second: All the prostitutes working in the brothels you mentioned did not speak because their family could be killed   This is only a possibility. Some might feel loyalty toward the madame, others might not want to cooperate with law enforcement, others might not legitimately want what you were offering. At best, you can only speculate based on limited, previous encounters what their motives are for not speaking up. Assuming that all of their families were under the mob's gun both distorts the reality of each prostitute and each brothel, and sweeps their unique circumstances under a rug of generalization.   Third: 99% of all prostitution stems from drug addiction.   This is simply not true. No formal study of prostitution has every produced these statistics, much less informal accounts.     Trust me that you cannot believe the public statements of folks from this underworld   I believe you. However, you are taking your experience with prostitution and generalizing it to the phenomenon of prostitution as a whole. Again, some prostitution is indeed linked to organized crime, yet a large portion of it is decidedly not."
China,3d7zl4,TheHenanist,-3,Tue Jul 14 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"You say I am generalizing from a skewed sample base.  For my part, you sound like someone who likes using prostitutes, and does not want to see the suffering that provides the service."

Knowing Chinese tourists, they probably snapped up daily necessities in bulk and not just souvenirs. Maybe the store, being in a little podunk town in the middle of nowhere, gets its stock delivered once a week or two weeks. Thus, when all of it is used up, it can't just call up and get more stock delivered right away. As such, its revenue remains pretty much the same except it's worse since everything got bought up in a one-time event.   If this town becomes a regular stop for Chinese cruises, maybe it might be more lucrative. Something tells me the locals don't really want that."

The last is probably the most important.  Most of the things you mention, including criticizing the government, criticizing corruption, supporting human rights, opposing the hukou system, etc, are fine. Some, including increased democracy, are official government policy. Heck, some are straight-up parts of the Chinese constitution.  Really, the only red line is challenging the party's position as the only legitimate rulers. Challenge or agitate on that question (publicly) and you will get in trouble.

People go to China to teach English for the adventure, the low working hours, and the ability to live a decent lifestyle and save even though you are making less money than you would in your home country.  For example, the last time I was teaching English full time I was making 10K/M in a small city, with housing provided. I saved 7-8K of that, and lived a quiet but comfortable life, and I got lucky with a job that was technically 20 teaching hours a week but actually more like 12 and they let me go home when I didn't have class, so I had loads of free time to exercise, study, and do things I enjoy. I also traveled a lot, and socialized a lot.  By my calculations at the time I'd have had to be making at least four times that to do the same in a Western country.  But my real goal was to improve my Chinese and live in a country that interests me, where I can get on a train somewhere new a couple times a month and chat to people along the way. I would have done it for a lot less."

Teaching is a good, firmly middle class job in Ireland but for my generation, you're luckily if you get a maternity leave and get to stay in a school for 6 months.   I'm moving to Beijing next month to teach English and although I'll have much more disposable income in Beijing than I would at home, honestly the real reason I want to go is for the adventure and to experience China"

However, the cost of living in China is very low and teachers often have benefits such as free housing, so it's much easier to save money in China. As an example, I currently make 15kRMB/month (roughly 2500USD). Not an outstanding number in the US, but in China I can live very comfortably on 1500USD per month and save the remaining 1000. I don't know anyone my age back home who can save that amount; hell, very few are able to save at all. Of course, there are other reasons people come here to teach, but from a relatively short-term financial perspective it's not actually a terrible idea, especially if you're young."

China,3d5c5p,ihatevisas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:32:39 2015 UTC,That doesn't add up at all.  You have to wash your clothes anyway so how is throwing your socks in expensive?  Buying new socks all the time sounds like a ridiculous hassle.  I think you are screwing yourself with this false economy.

China,3d5c5p,GuestBob,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:09:13 2015 UTC,I usually find jack and Jones or h&m have reasonable quality. The snug fit boxers I wear should last about 1 to 1.5 years. More expensive brands like Calvin Klein do a little better but the price difference is considerable.

Swingline, when you need to staple and you're ready to stop fucking around.  Get one in red and see which of your office buddies are movie buffs.  GPS unit if you're interested in hiking and geocaching.  Way better than using your phone.  Smartwool socks, wicking underwear, merino wool undershirts, etc.  All the wicking clothes here are polyester and other synthetics that smell funky after you sweat.  Leatherman multitool or whatever pocket knife you prefer.  The selection is way better in the states and the prices are too.  Gorilla glue.

Or worse, if stocks keep on rising again, all the idiots that barely avoided total bankruptcy will keep on borrowing safe in the knowledge zhengfu will never let them down.  Beijing is creating a unwinnable situation here. In the past, high natural rate of growth can mask mismanagement. Say if the natural economy could grow at 15%, and CCP knock it down by 5, that's still 10% growth.

Insert a golf ball into your mouth and keep it there while speaking to encourage natural language sounds. Remove before sleeping. After you no longer require the help of your golf ball to sound natural, it's time to whip your mouth into shape. Get into the habit of always chewing a toothpick or piece of straw while speaking. This helps your mouth mirror the natural, cigarette smoking dongbei mouth position. (If rapid progress is desired, replace toothpick or straw with Zhongnanhai 10mgs. 8mgs will also suffice.)

The first round would be the various ancient neighboring kingdoms that had tribute and trade relations with China, such as Japan and Myanmar. The names of the major Western nations were probably coined in the Ming dynasty by Jesuit priests and their counterparts in the Chinese court. Then you have smaller countries that may not have existed until the 20th century (and seem to be mostly based on their English names)."
China,3d6ik5,thisismytruetruename,6,Tue Jul 14 02:58:52 2015 UTC,"A number of these names were originally and initially decided way back when for postal purposes when the Brits were still running Hong Kong, so come from Cantonese pronunciations.  These proper nouns are in fact mostly phonetic, with any associated meanings (such as ""auspicious"" etc) being very much secondary.  The 加 in ""Canada"" for example is pronounced ""ga"" in Cantonese.  The 瑞 for Sweden and Switzerland is pronounced ""sui"" in Cantonese.  This is also where old names like Peking and Nanking came from:  the ""jing"" in Beijing and Nanjing is pronounced ""king"" in Cantonese.    Lots of examples of this."

Who is at fault? The vendor for over charging or the tourist for handing money over? Here is seems everyone expects to be protected from their own stupidity when they simply could have just said no.
China,3d46pl,ddsm88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:52:02 2015 UTC,"It's a little complicated by the role of a state-owned bank, and an apparent lack of regulations about things like declaration of risk. In the US, it is very clear when you buy a financial product that is not protected. By law, they have to tell you a zillion times before you can make the purchase."
China,3d46pl,xiefeilaga,2,Tue Jul 14 05:38:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, totally agree, but ignorance isn't really an excuse. ""Do you have any documents on the risks in this investment?"" ""No"" ""OK, here take my money anyway.""    Although, if the banks are conducting outright fraud (this is guaranteed! can't lose any money!) then they do have the right to sue, but not necessarily be compensated by the govt. Assuming, of course, they have written documentation of the guarantees, which I'm sure they don't. They just took a random strangers word, who is incentivized to push product. This isn't unique to China, naive investors get taken all the time.    There was a recent fraud in the billions of dollars by people saying they represented a Swiss investment company. People couldn't hand over their money fast enough, though turns out no one Swiss was actually involved."
China,3d46pl,ddsm88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:21:50 2015 UTC,"On one hand - sure they have no risk declaration processes in place, many years of scams and repurcussions have created the paperwork that is required today in more mature markets.

These were the largest protests that Tibet had seen since the 2008 Uprising.

Show me a Navajo language university in the states - fuck, show me a SPANISH language public university! Meanwhile, Latinos make up nearly 1/5 of the US population and they don't have a native-language schooling system. Tibetans make up less than .5% of the population in China and there Tibetan language universities.   Just to be clear - I think you are fighting a straw man. Neither I, nor anyone else with a working brain, thinks that everything is just A-OK in China's minority regions (I should know, I've been living in them for more than 3 years). But your argument is vague and unhelpful. I'm hoping to demonstrate that by pointing out the ubiquitous hypocrisy of people who criticize China's minorities policies but don't play an active role in minority issues in their own countries, where they might actually have a chance at changing something.

China,3d4k94,tan_guan,2,Tue Jul 14 01:13:30 2015 UTC,"First impressions:   Background pattern (a doorway?) is frustrating because it can barely be seen due to the panels of text and pics above it. It also pulls the eye out from the centre of the screen, which is where your readers' eyes should be. Replace it with a pattern, or a flat colour or something similarly neutral. Or have symmetrical, simple book-ending images on either sides (eg a few simple calligraphic swirls or flowers - not too many; nothing noisy). Better yet, just go for plain white. Better still, just drop the border altogether, unless you're planning on selling advertising in it. Even then, it's not necessary. Look at how Rock Paper Shotgun fills out the whole screen and still has room for a Crusader Kings fireplace ad. Rather than shearing off bits on either side of the screen, they move all of that space to the right-hand side, making the site feel more open, expansive and dynamic, even though the actual space used for text is about the same as it was in the old style, which looked more like your site. It would also make the ""hi from Sam and the team"" message seem less overbearing - right now it overshadows the stuff in your ""Recent posts"" section. Your web logo is three different logos smooshed together - the fussy, fiddly (Shanghai?) skyline image; the English text with the slightly annoying slanted line underneath, and the Chinese text. I'd say get rid of the skyline and integrate the Chinese more solidly into the English text (it's off-centre compared to the English text and looks like it's a late addition - the line doesn't help).  The logo is also too big. It's not particularly pretty in the first place (plan, ugly font, and thin letters don't look particularly good spaced out). Make it smaller, or at least less ""tall"" as it occupies a lot of your screen's real-estate, which should be devoted to showing the articles that are available.  The menu is also lost under that big logo, and should ""Contact"" really be as prominent as ""Stories"" and ""Features""? I'd suggest moving ""Contact"" and ""About us"" to the bottom of your page (people are here for your content, not for you, and those are links that people will seek out if they want them, not click on spontaneously) and making your logo less obtrusive. Look at what The Guardian does - keeps its logo off to the right, so that the first things the viewer's eyes hit are the different sections of the site. Make the search function stand out a little more. Make the random function stand out a little less. Changing the names of the sections might be a good idea too. ""Resources and reviews"" is longer than any other section, but is it your most important one? Why not make it two sections? What do you even mean by ""Resources""? What's the difference between ""Features"" and ""Stories""? And what's in ""Mandarin""? Is it a Mandarin version of the site, is it articles about the language itself, or are they learning tools? It's not very intuitive. The picture tabs for your top five articles are a jumble, with none of them particularly standing out. They're too close together, their titles are blending in with the images (which aren't amazing, but I know it's hard when you can't afford proper photographers or stock photos), and they're all the same size. Replace this with a single large image on a rotating carousel (you know - one of those things that rotates through different stories, like you see on The Escapist). Either lay the text under the images or try something like Rock Paper Shotgun's white-on-red text. Personally I think that's really ugly and much preferred their old carousel, but whatevs. The colours in general on your website are drab. Probably because a lot of the images were taken on a camera phone (and because that background image is bringing the vibe down). Ditch the greys and browns and that smudgy, sad red and use brighter primary colours to offset the crappy phone cam images. The Recent Posts section is too repetitive in its style, and nothing is really drawing my eye in. You need to decide whether you want people to look at the image first, the headline first or the text first. Ditch the horrible little grey boxes and lines that are around everything (ideally, as mentioned in the second post, ditch the background altogether and have everything push up to the left-hand side of the screen); if you want them to look at the headline, use a thicker font (in black or another prominent colour); if it's the images, try to have bigger, more attractive pictures; if it's the text, put it underneath the image, so it's less squashed. The menu on the Features page looks a bit nicer (though you need to be consistent about image sizes - the eraser image is bigger than the Dali image; I'd say the Dali one is about right). If possible, have the front page split into more sections, with varied types of presentation for different articles. Again, look at The Guardian - see how the images are different sizes and dimensions? And the headlines use different sized text? It makes the screen look more interesting, and also means that the reader's eye is drawn to a specific point - the large main image - before it roams around the screen, taking in the options. This may be difficult to automate though.  Also work on having punchier introductions to articles, and don't under-sell yourselves.

Pretty useful Chinese? You're not selling it to me. Try this: ""Bored of learning Chinese the hard way? We can fix that! Here's a fun lesson that'll teach you essential Chinese words.""  The actual article pages need work. I only looked at the exam cheating one (the eraser image) and the layout was messed up on two monitors (one square, one rectangular laptop) both running Chrome. First, the ""Related Articles"" window (and why is Dali a related article? You need to work on the metrics for that tab) fucks up the layout of the page if there's an image high up in the text. It looks like the code has trouble displaying an image to the left of the ""Related Articles"" box (maybe because it's centred?) so that there's a MASSIVE gap between the first paragraph and the first image. That needs sorting out. Also the text shouldn't run right the way across the screen. It's not comfortable to read. You see the way that Reddit hems in these messages by having that big column on the right-hand side with the posting guidelines etc? You'll probably notice a lot of sites doing that kind of thing - because it's more comfortable to read maybe half or three quarters of the way across a screen than it is to drag your eyes all the way from one side to the next. Extend the ""Related Articles"" column all the way to the bottom of the screen. Loads of websites do this too, one way or another. The AV Club, for example. Also note that the headline and main image run right across the page, while the body copy and ads are in a narrower area beneath. This adds impact. If you're going to use pictures, don't make them so small. Especially if they're going to sit in the middle of the page. This will probably be sorted out if you bring in the text so it doesn't run all the way across the screen.  Make the font bigger. This makes it more readable on tablets, but it also means a more pleasant reading experience on home computers too. People will be more inclined to scroll on to get to the next bit of big text than to drag their eyes across a lot of small text.    Good luck!"

But they're either 50% science, 50% liberal arts (if you include a foreign language and Chinese as liberal arts); or 75% liberal arts.  Lots of Chinese students seem to know a fair bit of history.  I guess there's not so much at a university level, unless they major in it. But even then, I think they often do politics, English, etc. The US system isn't that typical of universities - most countries let uni students specialize a lot earlier, unless they choose to do arts.

I see why you're angry, but let me say something...  How is this a race thing? Chinese people aren't more inclined to fight in groups because they DNA tells them. It's a culture thing. It sucks when you're 1 against many, but I'm on a Chinese basketball team and my team has my back. I know this because I've been in a few fights and when the other bench clears, they came to help immediately. So, IMHO, it goes both ways and sometimes its good to know you have a crew just in case shit goes sideways.  I'll admit, I was a bit annoyed that everyone was focusing on the disparity in numbers instead of the badassery of the kid, but I think a few of the folks here have had run ins with group beatdowns.  But when you lead in with ""GTFO of China"", you're not going to get very positive responses."

This country is still incredibly poor, and most people don't have disposable income for things like hand sanitizer. There is no toilet paper or soap because people would steal it. Don't be fooled by the luxury cars and boutique brands you see in Shanghai, you're looking at the 1%.  Even the majority of middle-class and rich people in China grew up in conditions we would consider squalid and extremely unhygienic. People who went to top universities lived in dorms where there was no air-conditioning in summer, so soap or toilet paper, and no showers in the building. In winter there is hot water once a week.  So to answer your question, most people in China don't think that hand-washing is a big deal, let alone soap, let alone hand sanitizer."

You can totally order people around here, but things become more effective if you can explain the WHY and if you can mentor your team. Otherwise you'll always be left with ""dumb"" minions. They will not understand your way, and you'll never understand theirs and you'll not really get anywhere except by brute force and persistence (which can be done but it's not fun).  I imagine that if my team would speak Chinese only, I'd have a hard time - unless I could finally get around to upgrade my Chinese to a better level.  Also, be careful when working with people acting as translators. More than once I felt that my carefully crafted explanations were simply translated into ""just do it, idiots!"" - as in the old ways where people just did whatever the ""emperor"" told them without raising any protest. I.e. people here will take a lot of abuse (from coworkers, clients, etc.) before you'll even know that things are not going well and that they'll be abused. You can even end up yourself abusing your team by accident - people will rarely complain if your management sucks, or if you overwork them (although, you'd probably still do a much better job than many Chinese bosses). However they may just suddenly and without warning quit - most people don't talk problems over, they just leave.

What job are you looking for exactly ? Depending on your answer you may or may not be able to find a job in a company that will help you to move and get a work visa.

And also at the first three years, In China your salary from IT industry will be much lower than your English-teaching job, and work longer.

However, IT positions and other tech positions in China are grossly underpaid by all but the largest of corporations (Baidu, Alibaba) and they're extremely competitive. There's pretty much no way they would hire you on as a developer or IT specialist because you would have major communication issues that a native wouldn't have; especially after just a year of learning Mandarin part time.  The company I'm working for has a small army of IT guys who basically just sit around watching movies all day, but their pay is like $500 a month. It's a big company too, with 20+ offices in Beijing and around 200 across China. Foreigners make up about 20-30% of hires but I've never heard of any that work in the IT department.   I think your best bet would be looking at working with an expat founded startup, or maybe several as a consultant or something along those lines rather. A company that small won't be able to fund you for a Z visa, though. I think your chances of getting in as an IT worker are slim to 0, but consulting might be more feasible."

Laduzi my first two days here. The presence of a very clean Western-style toilet about a minute's walk away from my office definitely helped. I also downed half a bottle of Seirogan but I don't know if that helped at all.   Oh yeah, it happened (not that early, but still) when I was out with my cousin... We ate at a small restaurant somewhere (bad idea), and about an hour later my stomach was feeling funny. We were actually walking toward the subway to go somewhere else. So after we got in the station, I basically told my cousin that I will be in the toilet near the platform and basically ditched them... And I had to take the one for the handicapped, because, to my horror, the regular one are those 'Asian-style' (for a lack of better word) toilet (I mean, it's not like I haven't used it before. But it's just that I haven't used it for so long that I don't think I will be able to use it at that time). About three minutes into my laduzi, my cousin called me because they can't find me (no shit, I was already in the toilet (-_-)). So I had to tell them that 'no, I didn't actually tried to ditch you, it was an actual emergency. And I am actually still here, don't worry'.  Looking back at it, I definitely should've packed a fucking bottle of bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol)...   My Internet connection is super slow and I need to upload my pictures to Facebook like 5+ times before they don't give some inexplicable error. It took me an entire afternoon to download Hearthstone and I'm not going to even bother watching any anime.   Oh yes, the internet is godawful. Even when visiting website within China, the connection speed is hilariously slow. Don't get me started with the websites that require VPN... (damn you, great firewall and your harmonisation.

I mean there is always going to be deviants who will argue that someone is ugly, even though they are clearly attractive or ""pleasant"" to look at (perfect mathematical proportions and symmetry).   I think the same can apply for aural aesthetics. For instance, on a piano, I can play C, C+D , C, C#, D#, D, C+D. That sounds hideous to everybody. Of course, there is probably going to be a deviant who will say that sounds nice, but most people are going to say that is an ugly sequence of sounds."

I've been to Chinatown in SF and other places, and frankly I can see why Chinese people were considered dirty by Americans.

Prior to the 80s-90s almost all the Chinese people in the west were from Taishan, Canton, Hong Kong. You could say the same thing about Hong Kong and Xianggang as well. The latter sounds softer, and even when northeasterns say Chongqing it ends up sounding like Schongchingr cuz they do that slurring thing every other syllable."
China,3d0q3y,thewhiskybone,-1,Sun Jul 12 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's subjective. If it were subjective then we would see a real mixed bag of opinions for Cantonese. But we do not get that. Nearly everybody with different ""mother tongues"" regard Cantonese (and other Indochinese languages) as sounding ugly. The only people who like those languages are people who speak those languages.   Interestingly, if you ask a Vietnamese if they think Khmer sounds pleasant (Khmer and Vietnamese are in the same language family), they will say no, it sounds hideous. If you asked a Khmer if they thought Vietnamese sounds nice, they will also say no. Both Cambodian and Vietnamese people probably prefer the sound of Japanese over languages that are within their same family. I think this sort of points to an objective component, if members of a language family regard another language within their language family as sounding ugly, then it's probably ugly.   We do not see this with other languages within the same family such as Spanish and Italian. I think Spanish people do not consider Italian as sounding ugly, and vice versa. I think both Spaniards and Italians would regard Khmer as jarring, but love the sound of Japanese.   To me, Cantonese does not sound like ching chong ling long ting tong at all. Cantonese for me is:  ""Ngo dip buc yik si dung lip jup"" (gibberish I just constructed)  Neither for Mandarin. The characteristic sounds of mandarin for me, are the ""sh"" noises (shi, shuo'r, shuai, shou) rather than ching chong chang etc."

I love my hometown but I hate the Seattle freeze, traffic and how everywhere seems to close up shop really early.  Also I don't really know what hearthstone is (its some sort of computer game, right) but if its a popular computer game why don't you check out your local internet cafe, they usually have every game you can think of plus some.

The light rail system is fucking stupid, its only purpose seems to be taking people between city and airport, within the underground tunnel part you can just take another fucking bus instead, what a huge joke.  I would rather commute a longer time on a single, more crowded bus if it came with the regularity and timeliness of Chinese buses.  I haven't really taken the 48 or the 24, but I've taken the 71/72/73, and they're total shit too. Sometimes you'll see two of them come within like five minutes of each other, and sometimes I'll inexplicably have to wait upwards of 15 minutes for one."
China,3d0q3y,komnenos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:44:53 2015 UTC,"I went to Roosevelt high school and took the 48 home everyday.  There was a bus that came two minutes before school got out and then another one 25 minutes later.  Sometimes the teachers were merciful and let me out a few minutes early to catch the early bus but 95% of the time I had to wait for the other bus.  It just so happened that traffic hit right as the other bus was supposed to come and I'd often wait 45 minutes and see three 48s all in a row.  Same with taking the 31, 32 back from UW.  The service for my local line (the 24) is pretty good but the damn thing only comes once every 35-45 minutes and 45 minutes to an hour on the weekends.  I was absolutely blown away by how good the subways and buses were in China.  Always on time and there were quite a few.  Even in rural Shandong or Fujian there were a number of buses and I never had to wait longer then 30 minutes for a bus in super rural China.  Yeah and the light rail has been such a letdown.  Doesn't it cost a lot more than taking a bus?  I wouldn't know though, as it stands its too far out of the way to be useful to me."

Growing up I would read history for hours, sometimes Chinese would be the focus, sometimes it wouldn't.  My sophomore year of college I studied abroad in the UK and my next door neighbor Liu was Chinese.  Liu was studying abroad as well with a group of eight people in total, when of the guys has become my best friend and I dated one of the girls for two and a half years.  I bonded with them and hung out with them all the time, found I loved the food, thought the language sounded cool and several of the girls were cute and smart.  I'd stay up discussing politics and culture night after night with them.  Eventually we parted ways and I went home and started taking Chinese language classes and Chinese history and politics classes.  One of my favorite professors who emailed me if I wanted to intern with him and work on a few projects with the ADB.  I felt honored that out of the hundreds of kids he teaches that he picked me.  Last summer I went to China and saw my girlfriend for the first time in person in over a year and a half.  We explored Beijing together and several days later I went and saw her and everyone else from that group I met in the UK graduate.  My girl went of to Taiwan with some gal pals for several days and I explored Shandong and Hangzhou with my best friend before meeting my girlfriend again in her hometown of Fuzhou where I met her incredibly big family.  I loved the food, the family and the vibe of the city.  I miss it and can't wait to go back, this time for a year and a half.  I love Chinese food, language, history, culture, the hustle and bustle, the lack of the ""Seattle Freeze,"" the people and now that I'm single the women don't look too bad either. :P  There are things I don't like but currently the good outweighs the bad.

The reason why Beijing is so congested isn't just because of people, but also because it has a terribly inefficient road/public transport system.  Public facilities are not concentrated at a few core area, like Tokyo. Instead they're spread out all over the place. To get from one place people visit to another, it takes 3-4 interchanges on the subway.... not to mention the subways themselves seems to only go in rectangles.  If anything, Beijing should be identifying a few key districts - and concentrating everything in these districts, like Tokyo with Shinjuku, Shubuya, Ueno etc. Then have subways connecting direct between these key districts... following diagonals rather than squares."

Another difference is the high ownership of cars in China, while relatively low in Japan. Reason for it is because even the ugliest peasant girl won't marry a car-less nong. And Chinese still believe that mass transit is for the poor, too concerned with face and showing off to consider taking the bus of the subway."
China,3d07x4,BornIntoConfusion,7,Sun Jul 12 13:05:51 2015 UTC,"This is also because public transport is just convenient in Tokyo.. subway stations land you in the middle of the action, not on some major road 10-15 minutes walk away (Tsinghua Uni, Sunlitun...).  If they bothered designing the public transport better, people, no matter how rich, would give up travelling by car in China's congestion. As it is now, I still always taxi from Wudaokao to anywhere I want to go (airport, sunlitun, Guomao, Donsi), even though there's subways... just because they're designed to obnoxiously....

China,3d07x4,rockyrainy,3,Sun Jul 12 19:00:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, the big problem is there is no pedestrian shortcuts through blocks. You have to walk where the 8 line road is. They should really break big blocks into pedestrian friendly walkways; with MRT stations and entertainment centers in the middle of the blocks...   Pedestrians can then land right in the action; through public transport... This is been done to great effect in Singapore.  Instead, Bejinng loves putting its entertainment centers in the crossroads of 2 roads (looking at you Sunlitun, Guomao... to an extent Wudao Kao).

Having to go there consecutively to sign or move a document from one table to another 3 or 4 days in a row is just horribly inefficient. In the city I live, from the nearest bus station, you still have to walk 15 - 20 minutes into the city government buildings.  I could take my e-bike but they're about an hour - an hour and a half ride out of the city center (after the move).  There's nothing I hate more than having to go there.

These are Chinese stocks, they have their own thing and its not like other stocks in the world. Reading too much in to them whether they are rising or falling is useless, as of now.     This strategy of market manipulation has worked for China for years. Can it work indefinitely? Or will it eventually result in a much more significant economic correction later on?   Calling rate cuts of various kinds and tweaking banking sector policies as Market Manipulation is rather crude and missing the point and distorts the narrative.    These are legitimate tools which a state has at its disposal and its using them.    Even a currency peg is not illegal or bad or good or anything in that scale of viewing. Its just a tool that States have. As is QE's and what not's.   Nothing is eternal. Chinese Govt is stable and has massive backup of funds. They are in the best condition to absorb a bad time. They have handled worse before in worse conditions.    They can extend this for as long as the overall economy is growing, which it is and it will, because if push comes to shove, they have the tools to force the issue. China could have 10% growth rates if it wants but its heeding the advice that every Western and Asian economist was telling it for decade, calm down and reorient. Its doing that."

Calling rate cuts of various kinds and tweaking banking sector policies as Market Manipulation is rather crude and missing the point and distorts the narrative.   We are not talking about ""tweaking banking policy."" The govt has forced banks to keep lending to projects they know wont be paid. The government is forcing banks to take on bonds that are priced below market rates. The govt forced major shareholders to hold stock. If you don't see this as ""tweaking"" I would love to know what you think really qualifies as market manipulation.   Chinese Govt is stable and has massive backup of funds   That's a very relative statement. Compared to Somolia's govt China is stable. China just detained over 77 lawyers for subversion. It cannot be that stable if it's afraid of a handful of lawyers defending their clients. Same goes for internet restrictions or fear of foreign textbooks; a stable and confident govt wouldn't feel it needed to keep its people in the dark and scare people into obedience. A stable govt wouldn't feel the need to use everything at its disposal to artificially prop up the stock market either (at the expense of the market itself)."

The point being, the Chinese Stocks are and never have been true markets, they are an aberration and anyone who gives credence to them for any narrative of any sort is kidding themselves.     We are not talking about ""tweaking banking policy.""   Yes you are. Your quotes in your summary is proof of this.    And you are out of the loop. China did this in the 90's. They are not just forcing the banks to lend willy nilly.There is a systemic way its been done.    Its called debt restructuring. And its tweaking NOT Market Manipulation. Because the latter has the semantic connotation of being nefarious and illegal and out of the norm.    None of the Chinese action is that. Its perfectly withing what is the norm for Sovereign states who manage their economic policy. And the Chinese did the exact same thing in the 90 and that was a time when they were in far less overall stable position. Today the Chinese have massive reserves and other options.     If you don't see this as ""tweaking""..   For the record, it was me who called it tweaking, you called it Market Manipulation. The difference is real and its not trivial.    I don't recall the last time changing the interest rates in a sovereign state was considered as Market Manipulation. Semantics matter.     That's a very relative statement.   Its relative for all and everyone. Hence normalization is rendered on all, hence your retort is redundant.    In a country of 1.3 Billion 77 detentions is low, i expected more. China has had periods where it was worse both economically and in terms of stability. Anyone who believes its not stable at the moment is clearly not in tune with reality.    And having internet restrictions, using aggressive measures for stock markets are neither the metric not the smoking gun to back up the claim that China is not stable.

I might recommend, the J Curve or Why Nations Fail. China is a textbook case of a regime facing growing instability pushing itself up the left of the J-curve (more repression).

I did the second option and it was about 150 for the one-hour drive there.

China,3d0w2x,foreignscumball9,0,Sun Jul 12 16:32:47 2015 UTC,Yea but then I'm lugging a Few boxed to a friend's house.  Hopefully I'll do that from my house just unsure if I can use a generic destination.
China,3d01cz,Th3S1l3nc3,9,Sun Jul 12 09:42:22 2015 UTC,"I did it. I had 10 grand US dollars. I wore a money belt. The chinese security noticed it (It wasn't tucked in enough) made me take it off and run it through the x-ray, but that was it. No comments or questions.   But I did that 6 years ago. Now I just bring back the money via ATM. Lowest exchange rate fees and very low processing fees. Much cheaper than exchanging at the bank or paying western union fees. Over 80% of ATM's in America accept unionpay (unionpay and Discover have linked networks, so if u can use discover, you can use unionpay.)   The only limit is the america side limit. For example the chase ATM I used had a $2,000 a day limit, so I had to go back a few times to get it all.   The way I see it is you don't need to carry cash anymore. Just don't lose your ATM card."
China,3d01cz,borkya,4,Sun Jul 12 10:59:51 2015 UTC,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! You mean you're just withdrawing it via ATM in the states? I mean I knew I could use my US card here, but I assumed my ICBC card wouldn't. Chinar don't want their money leaving.  I'll check with them Tuesday about using my card overseas. This is a huge relief.  Was not excited about hauling cash."

China,3d01cz,jamar030303,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:35:11 2015 UTC,"Trust me, if your card still has the magstripe, it'll work. If it doesn't, mail your card to someone you trust in China, have them withdraw the cash, convert and wire it.   If you were moving to Canada I would say to get a local ICBC account and link the two in online banking. If you're moving to a border state you may still wish to consider this option."
China,3d01cz,borkya,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"THat would be even better, but unfortunately I'm headed south.  Everything seems to point to this working, so I'm feeling pretty confident about it, but still just paranoid.  Just some stupid fucking reason that ICBC will say it doesn't work or block it or something. This is a good plan though, thanks for the input!"
China,3d01cz,borkya,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:26:24 2015 UTC,"If you're still worried, one more possibility is to get a cashier's check. Ask your branch if they do 外币汇票; if they do it's usually a 0.5% fee and whatever exchange rate they're applying that day. You get a cashier's check that can be deposited at any bank in the US just like that. You can even use the photo deposit function with them if your bank supports it."
China,3d01cz,borkya,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:04:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unionpay is now a world player. You can even use it at target in America. It's accepted like an ATM. The 6 digit pin is no problem. Look it up online, because honestly people in your local bank might have absolutely no idea. There is even a wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_UnionPay  Here's the bit about america:  United States of America: Citibank accepts UnionPay cards at ATMs for United States dollar withdrawals. In May 2005 Discover Network announced an alliance with China UnionPay Network. The two companies have signed a long-term agreement that allows acceptance of Discover Network brand cards at UnionPay ATMs and point-of-sale terminals in China and acceptance of China UnionPay cards on the PULSE network in the U.S. Wells Fargo accepts UnionPay cards at ATMs for United States dollar withdrawals, recently confirmed in February 2013.[25] As of November 1, 2007, China UnionPay cards may be accepted where Discover Network Cards are accepted in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.[26] However, Discover does not support China UnionPay for e-commerce or card-not-present transactions. As of early 2013 Discover now supports card-not-present transactions."

I'm so sick of people lying, saying shit they dont now, etc. Not saying you are, that's why I'm posting here instead of doing the logical thing and asking my bank, which likely would know nothing.    UnionPay Debit Cards, however, can only be used in the UnionPay network and other networks that have signed contracts with UnionPay    So I don't have a credit card here in China. It's a debit card, so I just have to find a Union Pay ATM and I'm good?"
China,3d01cz,jamar030303,3,Sun Jul 12 14:05:54 2015 UTC,"no, I only have a union pay ATM card (not a credit card) and have found most ATM's work for me. Chase, bank of America etc have all worked. Like I said, the only one that didn't want TD bank. But most ATM's DON'T have a union pay sign. So try it anyway. 9 times out of 10 it will still work."

She brought 10,000 with her but the people at the airport stopped her, said she couldn't do that and tried to seize the extra 5,000.  Fortunately she had a cousin who worked there who took the extra cash back to her family but it was pretty close.

China,3d01cz,Jgj7861,2,Sun Jul 12 10:06:14 2015 UTC,"No, good point.  I haven't decided if I want to change it here or there. But probably going to change here. Simply because 255 bills is bulkier than 55 bills. But either way, it equates to $5,000.   Which, as /u/xiaosile says is under the limit.  I'm looking for the site that said $5,000 needed some kind of verification."

Hah! Pfahahaha! Their capital is a polluted thermonuclear wreck. They are panicking over water and food resource shortages. Their government is an ultra-heavy handed dictatorship of super-greedy elites with absolutely zero accountability. Cities are garbage pits with chunks of broken concrete, construction detritus, and dust everywhere. People are kept very ignorant of the rest of the world because their government prevents them from accessing much of the internet. Their entire education system is essentially one big joke.

China,3cysja,skullblasta,5,Sun Jul 12 01:03:29 2015 UTC,You say that as if those problems will prevent China from being the economic powerhouse. China is and will be a slightly dystopian place but that doesn't mean they can't have a giant power.   Many parts of the U.S. have been absolute shitholes a few decades ago but didn't stop the U.S. from being a superpower.
China,3cysja,kamakie,2,Sun Jul 12 14:31:33 2015 UTC,"A few decades ago the United States had been a global superpower for the preceding four decades. Today the United States is the uncontested hyperpower of the world. China is nowhere close to overtaking that position. Saying ""BUT MURICA HAS SHITTY PLACES TOO"" doesn't alter the fact that outside of the shiny mega cities, the country as a whole is still sitting in the 1950s."
China,3cysja,movingon11,13,Mon Jul 13 02:42:35 2015 UTC,"Also, Mandarin is about as practical as a cat flap in an elephants house. China's literary soft power ambitions gone down the shitter already in it's hope of usurping English as a global lingua-franca."
China,3cysja,derintellectual,14,Sun Jul 12 01:16:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah the idea of using Mandarin as a world language is a huge joke. No one wants to learn a bazillion characters when they have handy alphabets. China has zero soft power anyway - anything admirable about them was done hundreds of years ago before they were turned into a nation of gawky, cultureless commie-drones."
China,3cysja,skullblasta,23,Sun Jul 12 01:20:52 2015 UTC,"English isn't the lingua franca because it's easier to learn. It's because english speaking countries colonized the shit out if the entire world.   English has its problems too. Even with only 26 letters to memorize, spelling is rarely phonetic and letters are pronounced differently in different words with not much in the way of patterns. The grammar rules are more like loose guidelines and there are many many exceptions to memorize.   Mandarin, while having thousands of characters, has a relatively simple grammar system. Also, it'd not like each character is completely separate from one another. The radicals of each character give clues to either the pronunciation or the meaning so it's not complete memorization.   English is difficult for mandarin speakers because it's a fairly different system and the reverse is true also."
China,3cysja,xuankun,6,Sun Jul 12 04:36:54 2015 UTC,"The writing system really does hamper Chinese from ever becoming a global language though, because it is a huge barrier to any sort of written communication. Even once you learn about radicals and phonetic components there's still a huge amount of rote memorization you have to do before you can do much with text.  Maybe in some situations you only need to be able to speak, but being in the US pretty much all my communication with people in other countries is written, so a language that requires so much extra work to read and write is going to have a hard time catching on.  I will say that now is probably the best time for Chinese to become a global language though because the language tools are so much better than before. When I was learning Chinese 10 or 11 years ago I was super jealous of one of my friends that could afford a Dell Axim with Pleco on it while I was stuck with a paper dictionary. Now anyone with a smartphone can look up characters just by drawing them and there are popup dictionaries for web browsing and electronic flash cards.  I think if I was going to start learning Chinese now I'd only learn the basics of handwriting and then just leave the rest to the computer."
China,3cysja,paradigmic,3,Sun Jul 12 07:13:08 2015 UTC,"Most people in the world would have a really hard time learning a tonal language, those are mostly limited to places like China and SE Asia. English may be hard for people who are used to simplistic grammar systems and language that lack final consonants but it's easier for the majority of the Eurasian world, and since Eurasia is certainly more developed and dominant than Africa, more people speak languages like English. Therefore, easier to learn.  You're right though really. English speakers colonized the shit out of the world. That's the main reason it's everywhere."
China,3cysja,skullblasta,2,Sun Jul 12 12:07:43 2015 UTC,"Actually most languages in the world are tonal, possibly about 70%. Although I'm not sure what percentage of the world actually has a tonal language as their mother tongue."

By no stretch of the imagination could Mexico and India be considered to be superpowers - both are developing economies like China, that have nothing major to offer that would distinguish them as superpowers."

When people say Chinese, it's most likely Mandarin which is indeed the official language of China, Taiwan and a co-official language for Singapore.   But when people say Chinese has over a billion speakers, that is false. Cantonese, Shanghainese, Hakka, Minnan, and Sichuanese are all different from Mandarin and not mutually intelligible.  Within China, many people do not or can barely speak Mandarin. The Chinese government said 400 million, maybe the real number is more. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-23975037  People in HK and Macau are mostly Cantonese speakers, some older people in Taiwan only speak Minnan language, a lot of the diaspora in North America, SE Asia, India, Caribbean etc speak Cantonese or Hakka."

A report made 2 or 3 years ago said that 79% of the rivers and lakes in China are too polluted to be used for agricultural purposes, let alone drinking. Food safety is worsening and the Chinese are increasingly relying on imported foodstuff to feed themselves. I can already see shops and manufacturers in other countries selling food and water at several times their retail price to Chinese traders or Chinese travelers.

China knew this but went ahead with full-scale industrializing and deliberately leaving the cleanup for later   Poor countries can't afford clean energy and industry with stringent environmental regulations. Poor populations care less about pollution than they do job opportunities and the option to get off their farm and live a better life.  We are starting to see change from the residents of the richer cities, and their discontent with the pollution is putting pressure on the leadership.  That is not to say that the government should be spared from criticism: cronyism, corruption, and terrible enforcement of environmental laws make pollution worse than it could be. However, I simply feel that a high level of pollution should be expected when poor countries undergo rapid industrialization. We did more than our fair share during our own industrialization and have since cleaned it up. China will follow suit and clean itself up as well once the people make it one of their top priorities."

China,3cysja,movingon11,2,Mon Jul 13 04:00:18 2015 UTC,"And yet most people buy consumer good based on price. Are all of those shoppers buying their goods at Walmart re-affirming their admiration for Chinese values with every purchase?  No. The global marketplace is far more complex than a simple popularity contest between nations.  I watch Hollywood movies at the theatre and at home because Hollywood truly dominates the market from the supply side. I go to Costa Coffee rather than Starbuck's because Costa makes better iced tea rather than any value judgement on their country of Origin (US vets Italy).  Cost, quality, marketing, and competition (or lack thereof) are not negligible factors when it comes to which brands people choose. They are, in fact, the deciding factors."
China,3cysja,Nefelia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:23:27 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll give you that, the product itself is what matters and it's more complex than a simple label check of the producer.  But I think after the great smear campaign in the US of the late 1980's/1990's against ""Made in China"", Americans are primed to feel something else when buying products from China, it's an inevitable truth.  So there is still something there for the hearts and minds of US consumers.  Granted, this is a very nuanced subject and we could talk for a while about the global marketplace and its effect on cultural ""popularity contests"", or lack thereof, but I think you can agree with me and say that in this particular case, the average redneck gun-toting bible thumping truck-driving USA consumer is going to have a latent idea about picking up and buying something ""made in China"" versus ""made in Italy"" in a Walmart."

Sure they like well managed coffee brands and fast food chains, which coincidentally are mostly American. Sorry, but it's about more than commercial goods. When Chinese people go into Starbucks and pay a higher-than-normal price for the coffee, they aren't doing it because the coffee is great but for the lifestyle and culture it represents. Same with when people pay high prices for Nikes or Levis as opposed to Li Nings or whatever. This goes beyond appreciation for the ""commercial goods.""   Do you even live in China? Do you not see young Chinese frequenting coffee cafes and bars as opposed to teahouses, play and listen to rock and techno and rock as opposed to Chinese ""traditional"" music? I do in Beijing.   By the way, jeans are popular enough in Japan. Besides the cheaper stuff from Uniqlo, there are a few Japanese brands that make expensive stuff."
China,3cysja,skullblasta,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:58:23 2015 UTC,"And why do those European and Indian movies not do as well? Why do I not have the choice before me when it comes to the box office?  Marketing, advertisement, distribution networks, accessorizing, etc, all play a major role before the existence of these movies even come into play.   Economies (and markets) of scale do not only apply to manufactured consumer goods. The US is, and was for a long time, the largest market for movies, both at home and in the cinema. Movies that appealed to the US audience' tastes, ideologies, self-image, and vanities had (and still have) a better reception in he US.  Subtle French satires criticizing the policies of the French government don't do as well as brainless action flicks casting a cast of American heroes saving the world against an army of genocidal alien beings. Go figure.  Perhaps e French directors should get on board and produce similar action flicks from France, but I am fairly sure some of me would rather gouge their eyes out than 'sully' their hands in such an endeavor.  Edit: I have lived in China for over ten years. And while I do see a lot of e younger hipper types going to Starbucks primarily for the prestige in their silly social competition, I also have never seen a taxi driver drinking coffee. They all seem to have big containers of tea somewhere under their seats.  As for the Japanese and jeans, of the last 28 Japanese to have passed the coffee shop I am sitting in, only two of them were wearing jeans... And they may very well have been tourists."
China,3cysja,Deceptichum,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:35:02 2015 UTC,"Of course marketing and availability play a role, but the common thread through all these products and services is that they are from the US. I hope I don't need to explain that when people like a lot of products and food and movies from a country, they'll tend to have positive thoughts to that country, especially if that country happens to be the world's most dominant country, economically, technologically and military wise.  It's not just the US, countries like the UK and South Korea and even Japan are admired in China due to their TV shows and products. Inversely the fact China makes a lot of cheap and poor-quality products gives people a negative impression of Chinese products.  These younger Chinese are the future consumer class. Their tastes will drive the future market. Tea drinking is popular among older people but coffee and other Western drinks are increasingly gaining ground. Likewise Western foods and music are becoming popular.  Look, I don't think Hollywood movies are the pinnacle of filmmaking; I hate some of those blockbusters, but you can't deny the Chinese love those movies and are eating those up (Transformers 4?).  You actually counted Japanese passing by the coffee shop you were at just to prove most don't wear jeans? Are you that desperate to prove a minor point?"

Tianjin, Shanghai, Beijing, and Jiangsu have already surpassed that point despite having their average dragged down by millions of terribly low-income jobs.

China,3czikp,Australosaurus,7,Sun Jul 12 05:01:27 2015 UTC,"by Stephen Nagy  For China, South Korea and Japan, the second world war has different starting points, meaning and impact on each country's respective identities. The inability of each nation to accept and relate to that self-understanding plays a crucial role in the lack of reconciliation up to present and, I would argue, into the future.  For most Japanese, the war began with the Mukden/Manchurian Incident in 1931 and ended with the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. A victim mentality persists, with Japanese seeing themselves as casualties of the atomic bomb and a military government that brought death and hardship. Japan's defeat is a reminder of its militarist past, for which many Japanese feel a sense of guilt and remorse. These experiences and the postwar pacifist constitution have deeply inculcated anti-militaristic norms in the Japanese identity.  Nonetheless, this process of self-understanding has been highly selective. The conflicts in China and the annexation of the Korean peninsula have not played a central role in Japan's modern identity. Instead, events such as the Meiji Restoration, postwar rebuilding and the economic miracle are the key experiences on which modern Japanese identity is rooted.  For Koreans, their national identity has been forged by their experience with Japanese colonialism, the Korean war and national division. The colonial experience marked the Japanese onslaught on the territory, culture, language and traditions of Korea. Being forced to adopt Japanese traditions, Koreans hold a sense of cultural violation. Deepening this sense of violation is the issue of ""comfort women"".  The Korean war further left the peninsula divided, with two sides competing to be the legitimate representative of Korea and defender against any future aggressor. This role strongly orients their self-understanding towards one that demands the recognition of past wrongdoings.  For China, the opium wars and the first Sino-Japanese war, which began in 1894, marked the beginning of a sense of violation, division and bullying by other countries, notably Japan, whose invasion caused the death of tens of millions of Chinese. China's self-understanding, which includes a profound sense of historical humiliation and victimhood, makes it feel it is on a moral high ground that justifies criticism of Japan and that it is now its turn to dictate the terms of international relations.  Each country feels the other is denying the fundamental parts of their modern identities. The Japanese people see their postwar history and commitment to peace as part of their modern identity. So when China and South Korea accuse Japan of being militaristic, nationalistic and unrepentant for its wartime past, many Japanese feel the core elements of their modern identity are not being recognised. Simply, Japan's imperial past represents a period of history that is alien to most and not representative of Japan today.  Koreans view Japan's self-understanding as problematic as it doesn't include recognition of the violations against the Korean people during the colonial period. Japan's complacency in this history means the core elements of modern Korean identity are not being recognised. These feelings are reinforced by the presence of the US military in the region, as it is a source of their sense of humiliation and vulnerability based on their peninsula's history of foreign interference.  China, too, understands its modern identity as being a victim of Japanese imperialism. Thus, the internment of class-A war criminals into Yasukuni Shrine, visits by political leaders to the shrine, textbooks that downplay Japan's imperial past and open discussion refuting Japan's role as an aggressor strike at the very core of Chinese modern identity. It leads them to the conclusion that the Japanese do not acknowledge their past or recognise the core experiences that make Chinese who they are.  This lack of recognition on all sides makes reconciliation problematic. Complicating matters is how history has been instrumentalised in each state. Historical amnesia by some politicians and parties allowed Japan to rebuild quickly after the second world war and avoid responsibility for its wartime past. In South Korea, the comfort women issue has been unfortunately used to consolidate domestic support for politicians and avoid inconvenient truths about Korea's colonial experience.  In China, the government has effectively used history to legitimise its rule, having been the liberators from Japanese imperialism. Inconvenient truths, such as the nationalists' role in fighting the Japanese, are avoided. What's more, Japan's postwar history is neatly ignored to ensure the victim narrative remains dominant.  In the face of such challenges, reconciliation will continue at a glacial pace.  Politicians need to be aware that instrumentalisation of history can result in an escalation of mutual distrust in the region and heighten the chance for conflict. It is in the interest of all three countries to begin the process of reconciliation through recognition of each other's modern identities and self-understandings. Implicit in this process is to engage in an exchange of self-understanding at the grass-roots level to allow people, not governments, to discover and recognise their own shared histories.  While everyday Chinese and Korean people may be portrayed as anti-Japanese in the popular media, the reality is far more complex. Student exchanges, media consumption and tourist numbers suggest that, on the ground, China and Korea are increasingly fascinated with their neighbour. At the same time, the acts of a politically prevalent few in Japan mask the pacifist attitudes many Japanese hold dear, making Japan appear far more militaristic than it is. Grass-roots exchanges allow us to avoid the instrumentalisation of history by governments and empower citizens to not only learn a shared past but to create a shared future based on mutual respect and recognition of the past and present."

China,3czuce,runningwithsharpie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:11:44 2015 UTC,"by Robert Gottliebsen  China faces the grave risk of duplicating the mistakes Japan made after the 1987 share crash. If China follows the path that Japan took in the nineties, then Australia will go into recession as it did when Japan, then Australia’s largest trading partner, hit the skids.  So, today, I want to take you back to the Japanese mistakes and show why China is showing clear signs of going down the same path.  During the 1980s, Japan embarked on a massive property investment exercise financed by the Japanese banks. In Australia, that frenzied Japanese buying of property was concentrated on tourist resorts with golf courses. Japanese banks dominated world markets. The 1987 sharemarket crash did not immediately trigger a property disaster -- it was delayed by about 18 months. But when the delayed tsunami hit property values it was savage, wiping out countess Japanese entrepreneurs and leaving Japanese banks with a huge pile of bad debts.  What the Japanese banks should have done was face up to the losses. But they did not want to lose ‘face’ so instead they buried their property losses. As a result Japan suffered from a broken banking system for almost a decade.  During the 1990s I regularly attended the World Economic Forum in Davos. On the Saturday morning of each World Economic Forum there was a session on Japan. Each year speakers would explain the dire bad debt problems of Japanese banks. Each year a Japanese banking official or political leader would get up and claim that there was no banking problem. Everyone at the WEF knew Japan was not telling the truth.  Not until the end of the 1990s did a Japanese banking official tell the truth and admit there was a bad debt problem in the Japanese banking system. But the culture of denial ran deep and it took another decade to really fix the system and Japan is still suffering from the after effects of those two lost decades.  In China today, the fact that mum and dad investors who borrowed big sums have been wiped out is serious but no more serious than the collapse of the now long forgotten Japanese golf-playing property entrepreneurs. As with Japan, the serious problem is the losses in the China credit system caused by the fall in the highly leveraged share market. These losses compound the hidden losses in China’s ghost cities where many residential towers have been built but no one occupies the buildings.  Unlike property, during a share crash the losses for lenders are normally there for all to see as they are reflected in the market. But this time in China we are looking at a potential duplication of the ghost city concealment of losses.  At least 1,500 of the 2,800 companies traded in China have elected to suspend their shares and the number is rising. Chinese companies -- particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises -- are seeking to avoid big share falls by suspending trading.  That means the real fall in the China sharemarket is much greater than has been shown on the books.  As I understand it, Chinese listed company shares can be suspended for months, even years, subject to regulatory approval. While those shares are delisted, banks funding share traders can theoretically claim that no loss has been incurred -- exactly what the Japanese banks did with property losses.  Once the stocks are relisted -- if they ever are -- they will be hammered, although they will be subject to circuit breakers which kick in to stop trading if shares go up or down by more than 10 per cent.  If the suspended companies do relist and they fall sharply, the full losses incurred by the Chinese banking system will be apparent at least to the government.  America has shown that when a country faces a financial problem it is usually best to face up to it and raise the required capital or let the enterprise fail. (Although, in the case of Lehman a rescue would have made sense.)  But open disclosure of loss was not the Japanese way and I suspect it will not be the Chinese way.  If China takes the Japanese path then it may be in the doldrums for a decade and that will keep commodity prices low. And my fear is that Chinese-backed apartment developments, which are vital to the current Australian economy, may go the same way as the Japanese purchases of resort properties.  Chinese is not a free enterprise country as we know it. The government controls the banks and it may simply print the required money and cover the losses. But we all need to recognise that this is the biggest challenge China has faced since the end of the Cultural Revolution and Australian prosperity depends on what they decide to do."

China,3cwgj4,Oedipus_Flex,13,Sat Jul 11 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"Stock market was correcting, it had gone up, gone up a bit too far, and was coming down as one expects.  In this situation it is the folks who bought right before the correction who lose money, which in this case was was somewhere around 90 million middle class folks who stood to lose purchasing power (can't buy as much shit).  This has social unrest issues and also messes with the CPC's plan to increase domestic consumption for goods.  There are also threats of people looking to their real estate holdings or other items to make up the difference.  Which could cause issues in those sectors given that real estate is stagnant right now.  So the government initially dicks around with various measures that don't do much beside scare brokers.  Market keeps dropping.  So now the government has suspended somewhere between 50 to 70% of the market.  If you hold over 5% of a stock you can't trade it, if your stock drops, your company is frozen.  At the same time volume in the market has not changed like one expects (since so much is frozen), which suggests a combination of investors being forced to buy (or state owned companies buying using Central Banking loans) and individuals buying back in.    Now the market is up, which of course is expected in that the government has basically preventing any kind of mass selling.  However at some point the government is going to have either unfreeze the market and allow selling or those who have stocks they can't sell will default on other loans (because they expected to use the profit from selling the stock to pay a debt or they need to sell because all their savings are in the market).    The government's long term plan is not clear at this point.  There are two more probable plans.  The first is that right now the freezes last until 2016.  In a month or two the government may let a few folks unfreeze early and try to trickle the selling back on to the market.  That is the market is growing say 3% a day, so you let enough people sell the growth is reduced to 1% a day.  Your average person sees the overall market growth and you can hopefully avoid any kind of herd sell off.  The second is keep everything frozen until 2016 and hope the market catches up.  That is say right now a stock is worth 50 dollars, but you bought it for 60 dollars.  So you sell now and you lose 10 dollars, but you think the stock will drop to 40, you'll sell anyway to avoid losing 20 dollars.  Whereas the government may be hoping that by the time they unfreeze your 60 dollar stock is worth 62 dollars because the company had a good quarter and you won't sell because the stock is going up.  I don't think the second option will work well in that lots of folks are going to have to spend the rest of 2015 stalling their creditors, so they'll sell pretty quickly.  For the first option of trickling folks and companies back on, in theory you could do it, but it's hard to do in the real world."
China,3cwgj4,Cai_E,3,Sat Jul 11 17:51:53 2015 UTC,"Panic is contagious. When some people started selling their stocks, the stocks dropped in value. Like rolling a snowball down a hill, a few people caused a panic that went beyond the normal ups and downs of the market as everyone sought to turn their stocks into money as quickly as possible, which made the stocks worth less money, which made more people panic quickly. However, this is true for any stock market. To borrow a favorite government phrase, the reason this happened in China is because of ""socialism with Chinese characteristics""  The Chinese have a herd mentality and a history where shit gets fucked up for lots of people very quickly, and they are people with less exposure to the stock market and greater preference for cash assets. The average Zhou wanted to make money by putting in half his savings in the market, but when it went from 100 to 80, he wanted to avoid it going to 60 or lower, so he cashed out. The power of millions of average Zhou's is quite strong when they all tend to go ""ai ya!"" at once.   The government didn't like this very much, so they ordered big banks and big companies, especially state-owned ones, to buy more stocks to increase their value. It went ok. It doesn't matter too much anyway, because the stock market isn't a big share of the Chinese economy like it was in the USA in 1929.   Edit:  Synopsis: The root cause: Over the past year, investors poured more and more into Chinese stocks, even though economic growth and company profits were weak. Retail investors -- think mom and pop, average folks -- were the most enthusiastic. A classic bubble developed.

China,3cwhc1,hessinger,3,Mon Jul 13 03:52:12 2015 UTC,"by Christina Larson  Priscilla Yang is standing outside Tuanjiehu Beijing Maternity Hospital, her husband dutifully holding aloft a purple umbrella to shield her from the blazing July sun. The 27-year-old is eight months pregnant and feeling relieved: Her latest rounds of prenatal tests came back normal.   Yang doesn’t know, but wonders about, the gender of her child. A college-educated public-relations executive, Yang says she hasn’t tried to wheedle illicit information from the maternity hospital staff. Boy or girl, “both are OK,” she says. “What I care most about is that the baby is healthy.”  Yang’s indifference about gender is becoming more common, though the struggle has been long. It has been illegal in China since 2001 for doctors to reveal the sex of the fetus to expectant parents. When ultrasound technology became widely available in the late 1980s, the number of sex-selective abortions shot up. Traditional Chinese culture prized sons, who performed heavy labor on farms and were expected to inherit land and stay home to care for elderly parents. Daughters left their parents’ household to join their husband’s after marriage. The one-child policy, announced in 1980 and enacted nationally within a few years, only intensified the desire for sons. Even after the 2001 law, many Chinese parents managed to bribe poorly paid doctors to see ultrasound results—then chose to abort female fetuses.   The result was a surplus of male babies. In 2004, China’s lopsided sex ratio reached 121.2 boys born for every 100 girls. (Without human intervention, 103 to 106 boys are born for every 100 girls.) The trend became most severe in isolated rural areas, where education levels were lowest and the farm economy’s reliance on sons continued to shape social attitudes; some of these areas have reported male ratios as high as 140.  China’s preference for male babies appears finally to have peaked. Official statistics show that for each of the past five years, China’s skewed gender ratio has narrowed; last year, 117.6 boys were born for every 100 girls nationwide. China is at “an inflection point on gender imbalance,” says Cai Yong, a demographer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He believes that government statistics undercount girls, because parents may not register daughters (especially if they were illegally born second or third children) and estimates the true ratio is closer to 115. “Ten years from now it will probably be about 110,” he says.  Researchers at Zhejiang University and University College London recently interviewed 212 men and women, ages 18 to 39, in both urban and rural areas of three Chinese provinces. The young respondents expressed very different attitudes from their parents. “Son preference isn’t common like it was before, and I think the sex [of the child] doesn’t matter,” said a 21-year-old woman in rural Zhejiang. As the researchers wrote in a 2013 paper in the Indian Journal of Gender Studies: “Evidence that son preference is weakening was a consistent finding across all the areas we explored. Many interviewees talked about how son preference was common in their parents’ generation but weak among their own peers.”  The result was a surplus of male babies. In 2004, China’s lopsided sex ratio reached 121.2 boys born for every 100 girls. (Without human intervention, 103 to 106 boys are born for every 100 girls.)

Many interviewees talked about how son preference was common in their parents’ generation but weak among their own peers.”  Urbanization and higher levels of education are blunting old attitudes. “When young people are more educated, they can push back more easily against tradition—especially against parental and grandparental expectations,” says Cai. “I grew up in a rural part of China, where everyone said you needed to have at least one son; in the old days people often said, ‘The more sons, the better.’ ” According to his research, in 2000 the majority of Chinese women of childbearing age had only middle school or lower education; by 2020, he projects that a quarter to a third of Chinese women will have attended college. Meanwhile, China’s massive program of urbanization continues; in 2011, for the first time, more than half the population was urban—the government estimates that by 2030, 70 percent will live in cities.  Daughters were once seen as a greater financial burden on their parents; today the reverse attitude is developing. The urban middle class expects the groom and his extended family to shoulder most of the financial responsibility for buying an apartment—sometimes regarded as a prerequisite to wedlock. (Getting hitched without already owning real estate is known as a “naked marriage.”) Guo Hui, a 31-year-old Beijing journalist, says, “If I have a baby, I would hope it’s a girl; boys are too expensive.”  As a result of the unbalanced sex ratio for the last 30 years, by 2020 China will be home to roughly 30 million more young men than women. That means a large number of men won’t be able to find wives—which has already increased the illegal trafficking of women from poorer neighboring countries, including Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam. Bachelors are also more prone to violence than their wedded peers.   The recent uptick in female births chronicled by UNC’s Cai will eventually blunt this negative development, but not until today’s girls grow up. “There still is a whole generation of excess males yet to enter the reproductive age group—and that is a serious cause for concern,” write the Zhejiang University researchers. At least the odds of young men looking for brides will gradually improve, and that’s a boon for them and China."
China,3cwhc1,thunder54,2,Sat Jul 11 10:51:42 2015 UTC,"it's pretty disgusting that most country folk see their own children as a commodity, past it was have a son send him to work let him make money which you can emotionally extort from him.

The government knows they can play that card any time they like, and the masses will respond. That was proven with the government's incitement against the Japanese."
China,3cvmlj,TheDark1,2,Sat Jul 11 11:35:38 2015 UTC,"Chinese people want to be America's wife. They're not gonna do that. The country relies on us for high technology, best practices, and management models that the top leadership wants to impose on larger companies - there's no way they'd jeopardize their relationship with the Western world before they had those things.  You're not being paranoid, and you're not being crazy, this is quite reasonable of you to be worried about this. I don't think Chinese would go for it though. They like white folk yo, and I'm pretty sure they're mostly over the century of humiliation."

The real story is every department of students need a slogan, and the shool of economics, with their sense of humor, chose that slogan to show their specialty, and everybody enjoyed the ceremony, and people remembered those students, they just don't need too much politics in that situation.

Reminds me of that story where a Chinese visitor criticises America's backward ways, but it's actually some backhand criticism of China itself.

China,3cvmlj,zakazaw,8,Sat Jul 11 08:44:21 2015 UTC,Yeah because if Chinese officials are known for anything it is political activism and humor.

China,3cw6d3,kamakie,10,Sat Jul 11 14:16:29 2015 UTC,"Faculty at Tsinghua here. I work in research, so I can't tell you specifically how their master's program are. I can say however, that Tsinghua certainly does not have a bad reputation in my research field. I had plenty of choices in choosing where to work, and would not have chosen Tsinghua otherwise.  Their academics are respect beyond China, and has a lot of influence especially in East Asia (Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore). I have worked in academia in several countries, and find that PhD students here is on par with most world top 50 universities (such as Uni Melb, etc)... just with worse English.  Universities in Australia also tend to regard our graduates students very highly, and the faculty there are quite eager to establish exchange programs so that our students are sent there for a year or two.  You're main problem will be the language barrier. Depending on which department you enter, many still teach in Chinese; which is unfortunate. The bureaucracy also takes some effort to navigate, as many departments in Tsinghua (except those specifically aimed for foreign students), are not that sued to have foreign students, and thus there quite a few hoops to jump through."

China,3cw6d3,ArcboundChampion,4,Sat Jul 11 12:37:56 2015 UTC,"I'm actually from a third world country though....  Here's my situation. I'm currently studying in Australia, but not at one of the more prestigious universities. After I finish my bachelor degree, I have the option to apply for a scholarship to do a PhD at my current uni (I already have a willing supervisor, but no funding) and I think I have a good chance of getting it because I've been doing very well academically and we should be able to come up with a good research plan. But even after completing a PhD, unless I can get permanent residency here, it'd be difficult to find a post-doc position. So I might still be doomed to go back to my home country and live off 500 bucks a month. Worst yet, my current degree will be useless in my home country.  I've heard that it's much easier for foreigners to enter top universities in China, so I thought it's a good opportunity to add new skills that will be very useful in the future, learn chinese (something I've been wanting to do in a long time), and get a degree from a university that's supposedly much more prestigious than my current one (whether or not this is true is what I was asking). Not to mention the cost of studying there is much lower. At the end of the 2 years of study, I will still be eligible to apply for the PhD scholarship so there will still be options for me to come back to Australia. And a CS degree wouldn't be so useless in my home country so if I'm forced to live there I might still be able to make 1500 bucks a month rather than 500.  So under this condition, is it still a terrible terrible pointless idea? Am I overlooking some other better options?"
China,3cw6d3,Smirth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:58:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd try my hardest to stay in Australia if you could. CS people get paid big money there, and with such a specialized degree, I honestly can't see how you'd have problems getting residency through a job.  Besides, I can't see why a country that doesn't recognize an Australian degree would recognize a Chinese degree. Sure, it's Tsinghua - not No. 1 NongYe DaXue - but it seems weird to me that a country would more readily recognize a country whose name is basically synonymous with corruption and ignore a well-developed country (even if they're currently having problems in unis specifically)."
China,3cw6d3,caucasianchinastrug,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:40:48 2015 UTC,"I should've probably said that the reason my degree will be useless in my country is because I'm currently studying biology and research really isn't a big thing there, not because of my uni. That's why I'm thinking it'd be quite useful for me to gain new skills in the CS area. it's not a niche field so there will be more jobs in my country. And I've always been interested in learning more about machine learning, etc. I can then go into fields like computational biology, or other areas that are not biology related. I can't think of a way that would let me study CS in Australia that doesn't involve spending an obscene amount of money, given that there's usually not many scholarship available for doing masters.

BTW: Standard Graduate Position for a Tsinghua CS Bachelors Graduate is around 10,000 RMB/month, often higher. Masters will command higher rates. This is Tsinghua we're taking about, not one of the average million college grads...  Chinese Universities are highly tiered, and quality between the top and the average is night and day...

I am not familiar with all departments in Tsinghua, but in my own, the courses taught by English are all done by people who are reasonably fluent in English (i.e., 4+ years of overseas experience).

Check what kind of classes you'll be attending. Check if the classes are in Chinese. If you do speak Chinese and can manage a double diploma, do it!"

I am doing a masters in Beijing because a journalists degree would be more useful if i spend time again in Beijing. Besides that, not sure what other value studying in China has because even in Qinghua, a top class university, there is corruption and as you probably saw they are making graduating students sing a song praising the CCP's intervention in the stock market. So yeah, still cringeworthy."

Whether it's worth it is up to her.  As you can see from the comments, the population of /r/China knows basically nothing about Chinese law. If you want to help your friend out, convince her to sit down with a lawyer. First consultations are usually free, and she can get a good idea of the pros and cons of her situation."
China,3cx863,xiefeilaga,4,Sun Jul 12 02:39:38 2015 UTC,"This is good advice, but I think it would probably be difficult to approach a lawyer directly since it is a sensitive situation. I suggest that you have her contact her branch of the All China Women's Federation, they will have data on suitable lawyers and also can provide information on the relevant laws. The ACWF has been partnering with international organizations on issues like combatting domestic violence and sexual harassment.  It is a branch of the government so of course there are some party line -towing old crows, but there are also a lot of professors, legal experts and others truly dedicated to women and these problems. At the very least they will have recommendations of lawyers who won't just scoff at her adding insult to injury.  Good luck."

They may then go and warn the boss and ask the company's labor representative to hold a workshop (or organize a workshop).  If the boss is Chinese... the labor department may do the same thing, but it would result in retaliation and the Labor Department would do nothing to stop this."

China,3cx863,Aan2007,2,Sun Jul 12 09:49:51 2015 UTC,"No.  Because if it is a boss... Someone with money... Who brings investment to the area... the police will not only look for the attackers but will also arrest the victim of harassment for her connection.  Unless the ""boss"" is a manager of Happy Girraf English School or some consultant.    Attacks on ""valuable"" foreigners potentially make China lose face. The main job of the police is protecting face and harmony."
China,3cx863,ogami_ito_sugoi_jiba,0,Sun Jul 12 13:57:17 2015 UTC,valuable foreigners have usually better things to do than harass some secretary
China,3cx863,Aan2007,2,Sun Jul 12 14:12:09 2015 UTC,"Uh... ""Valuable"" is in quotes.  It means who is valuable to China in the eyes of the CCP.  ""Valuable foreigners"" are foreigners who potentially have money and power.  Harassment between a boss and employee usually means between someone with power and someone who does not have it. And many people with power like to use that power to get away with whatever they can.  The labor board is not going to chase down senior managers if that gives the impression that any worker can fry-up a manager with an accusation... That would hurt China's investment climate, which in part depends on an image of a docile work force (which is prevented from unionizing, protesting, etc)  If the issue in the OPs post is what to do when a coworker harasses a girl... Then this becomes much simpler.  Tell the coworkers boss.  Ask them to talk with the harasser."

China,3cx863,fiver_saves,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:04:30 2015 UTC,China barely has laws against domestic violence   Are there laws in China explicitly stating that it is legal to beat your kids or/and your wife?  Or is there just a lack of laws against beating your kids or/and your wife? (This would just mean that in theory domestic violence is treated like any other kind of violence.)
China,3cx863,TimGuoRen,6,Tue Jul 14 12:41:18 2015 UTC,"it's her boss...  law sides with who has more money, and laziness of the police so you can forget that route. you aren't in sweden, you are in a third world country where laws are enforced when convienient to those enforcing it ie the rich.   if you are worried, this is normal, and you won't change or be able to do shit. accept it, or get a new job.  are you in china or is this some internet i met a chinese girl thing? why even mention sweden unless you have been here for a few days? your supplier? dating site? if dating site its most likely a scam or trying to get you to marry her.   you sound very timmy"
China,3cx863,caucasianchinastrug,2,Sat Jul 11 16:48:28 2015 UTC,What kind of system does china have for sexual harassment?   A very useful system. In exchange for granting the boss sexual access the woman gets to keep her job instead of being replaced by someone more cooperative.

Two bank tellers in Wenzhou, China have been infected with genital warts after gynecologists told them they caught the STD from touching dirty paper money. Most likely, according to doctors, the women were indirectly infected after handling the dirty money and using the bathroom without washing their hands prior.  One teller, a 30-year-old, claimed the only person she was sexually active with was her fiancé, who tested negative for any STDs. The other teller, who chose not to be identified, claims she has had no prior sexual experience.  According to doctors, most STDs, cannot usually be spread through mere contact with dirty toilet seats, shared utensils, public swimming pools or money. However, genital warts can be spread through skin-to-skin contact, even when no warts are visible. According to Planned Parenthood:  “Genital warts are spread by skin-to-skin contact — usually during vaginal, anal, or oral sex play. There is a chance genital warts can be spread even when no warts are visible. Treatment seems to lower the chance of passing the infection to a sex partner.”  Remember to always wash your hands after handling money, and it may also be smart to avoid cash transactions altogether if you are ever in Wenzhou, China.

China,3cuz37,somewhat_pragmatic,3,Sat Jul 11 03:18:50 2015 UTC,Not really.  The money they have in bonds is already out there in the US and world economy.    Basically the Chinese got a bunch of dollars from exports and used these dollars to buy governments bonds.  So the dollars are already out there floating around.  Selling the bonds would only affect currency with respect to who they sell them to and what currency for.  They could sell them for dollars on the open market (which could cause a slight $ appreciation) but then they'd have a pile of dollars and nothing to buy.  Dumping the bonds would only affect America's future ability to issue bonds.

China,3crs8a,TheDark1,4,Fri Jul 10 14:46:48 2015 UTC,Obviously because when you think of all the badass police action you've seen in your life it's all been English-language police movies.  They're just tapping into the culural badass-zeitgeist.
China,3crs8a,lebynthos,3,Fri Jul 10 17:51:22 2015 UTC,"English is the ""universal language"" of our time, especially in the business world.  Anyone in China who isn't Chinese, probably can read/speak english to some extent.  Its really more about the latin characters, though.  ""Police"", ""Policia"" etc are all easily recognizable even if your language isnt English, where as the Mandarin symbols etc would be completely alien to a latin-derived speaker."

China,3crs8a,TheHenanist,2,Fri Jul 10 22:13:04 2015 UTC,"in the last chapter they say that the drought in the UK was due to changes in UK law, i read somewhere else that the reason for the (almost worldwide) drought is the fact that shitloads of it were produced in india, but india cracked down on production and smuggling in the last years which is the reason for its drought most likely. i know that in east africa you can buy vials of it with 500mg inside for around 1$, while for the same amount you pay at least 50€ on the darknet, and offline for the powder (most likely cut) 70€ at least. if the UN bans it, people will most likely resort to its derivatives MXE and MXP, which are first off still legal in(most of) the US and other countries and preferred by many users due to them being of a longer duration and stronger effects.   i have one question tho: what does the fen in k-fen stand for ?"

China,3cs9s0,reshuiforever,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:44:25 2015 UTC,"By Barry Ritholtz A market, by definition, is a place where buyers and sellers can come together to exchange goods and services. That involves buying and selling those goods. Once you eliminate that free trading, you no longer have a market.  Then there is China, where the authorities have suspended the sale of 72 percent of the A share stocks. “Investors with stakes exceeding 5 percent must maintain their positions,” the China Securities Regulatory Commission said.  Throughout history, rules and regulations have slowly evolved to markets. Indeed, a certain level of regulation is desirable to ensure fair dealings, transparency and efficiency. By removing the ability to freely sell shares, the Shanghai Stock Exchange no longer qualifies as a market. I don’t know what it is, but if forced to come up with a name, the pursuit of accuracy would suggest calling it a government bureaucracy.  Lest you forgot, China remains a centrally planned autocratic regime ruled by the Communist Party. Niceties such as liquidity and free trading are deviant concepts. Pity Xiao Gang, the chairman of head of China Securities Regulatory Commission. The Wall Street Journal said he had “the toughest job in China.”  Let me suggest to Xiao that he might learn from the mistakes the West made in its recent crises.  During the dotcom bubble, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan failed to do anything to reduce the speculative excesses. Day trading, excessive leverage, mediocre listing requirements all worked to allow a huge bubble.  After years of gains, the Nasdaq Composite Index doubled in 6 months -- October 1999 to March 2000 -- before its historic collapse of almost 80 percent.  It may be too late for Xiao to learn much from those errors. He has allowed the use of speculative leverage to run amok in China, leading to the inflation of its historic bubble. Greenspan doubled down on his mistakes, slashing rates after the crash, which contributed to bubbles in real estate, credit and commodities. Perhaps Xiao might find that lesson useful.  During the subsequent financial crisis -- which had many causes -- the Securities and Exchange Commission sided with panicked bankers, implementing bans on short selling. That action subsequently spread around the world.  Ultimately, this kind of action removes a source of buying in a rout. Short sellers are typically the first to buy during a crash. Why? They have no risk in making the buy, as they are closing out an existing position. Thus, they act as a floor under a falling market.  The strongest collapse in U.S. equities took place after the SEC banned short selling in September 2008.  Consider the long buyer in a market selloff: They are catching the falling knife or anvil. They risk being early, and the trade is a money loser. Short sellers suffer no such disadvantage. Indeed, it is not much of a stretch to suggest that every short sale is a future buy.  How ineffective are prohibitions of short-selling? Recall the ban in the 1930s -- despite that, the Dow eventually fell 80 percent from its highs.  If stopping short sales does not prevent the occasional market collapse, consider these actual consequences of stopping sales altogether:  1) Causes markets to suffer a loss of integrity;  2) Selling halts are blatant market manipulations;  3) Are likely to cause a huge increase in volatility;  4) Ultimately creates a huge air pocket, leading to an even bigger crash when trading resumes after the six-month ban ends.  China's state-run Xinhua News reported that ""police had visited the China Securities Regulatory Commission to investigate “malicious short selling.” I  thought U.S. and European bans on short-selling were counterproductive and short-sighted, I can’t wait to see the result of these moves.   When the A-share market reopens in 2016, a bigger question will remain: Why would anyone want to invest in a market where you might not ever be able to sell?  There are many ways to cause a market crash. This should be one of the easiest to avoid.  China, which has made remarkable progress over the past 30 years, may have just set itself back a decade. Or we just found out we have been fooled by the regime's faux gestures toward capitalism. Either way, it will be interesting to watch this insane experiment unfold."
China,3cs9s0,impossinator,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:45:10 2015 UTC,No a single comment from all the so-called experts here.  Too funny.
China,3crc1j,lebeardnekk,7,Fri Jul 10 03:45:05 2015 UTC,"In case of paywall:  FOR nearly two years, hopes of economic reform in China have rested on the faintest of rhetorical shifts. At a conclave in late 2013 the Communist Party declared that it would let market forces play a “decisive role” in allocating resources; previously, their influence had been just “basic”. A slender reed perhaps, but it supported a great expectation: that the state would ease its grip on business, trade and finance.  These hopes have been dealt a blow this week by China’s stockmarket crash. By the end of July 7th trading in over 90% of the 2,774 shares listed on Chinese exchanges was suspended or halted. Shares have fallen by a third in less than a month, wiping out some $3.5 trillion in wealth, more than the total value of India’s stockmarket. It is not the plunge in share prices, however, nor the implications for the Chinese economy that are worrying, so much as the government’s frenzied attempts to bring the sell-off to a stop.  The market mayhem is the first grave economic blemish on Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, China’s leaders. Officials’ botched attempts to repair the damage have only made a bad situation worse. The danger now is that the party draws the wrong conclusions—leaving China more vulnerable to instability.  Red flag  The first mistake—often made by China pessimists—is to think that the market crash presages an economic collapse. That is most unlikely. True, the stockmarket is down by a third in a few weeks, but it has fallen back only to March levels; it is still up by 75% in a year.  Lost in the drama is the fact that the stockmarket still plays a small role in China. The free-float value of Chinese markets—the amount available for trading—is just about a third of GDP, compared with more than 100% in developed economies. Less than 15% of household financial assets are invested in the stockmarket, which is why soaring shares did little to boost consumption and their crash should do little to hurt it. Many stocks were bought with debt, and the unwinding of these loans helps explain why the government has been unable to stop the rout. But such financing is not a systemic risk; the loans are about 1.5% of total assets in the banking system. The economy is solid. Growth, though slowing, has stabilised. The property market, long becalmed, is picking up. Money-market rates are low and steady, suggesting banks are stable.  To be fair, Chinese officials understand this. The trouble is that they are less willing to accept the two fundamental causes of instability: the structure of markets and China’s brittle politics. Take each in turn.  From mid-2014 until early June, ChiNext, a market for start-ups, more than tripled. China’s mania derived partly from the way the market functioned. Regulators act as gatekeepers over initial public offerings, in effect deciding which firms list, when and at what price. Because the government was initially slow to approve new IPOs, those firms already lucky enough to have ChiNext listings became financing vehicles. Investors pumped their shares higher, knowing that the capital could buy firms waiting in the long queue to list. Hence the wooden-flooring company that remade itself as an online-gaming developer and the fireworks-maker that became a peer-to-peer lender, among dozens of similar mutations. Before long, the ChiNext price-to-earnings ratio had reached 147, putting it in the same league as NASDAQ during the dotcom era.  China’s repressed financial system helped inflate the bubble by pumping money into the stockmarket. Banks pay interest rates well below the level that would be expected without regulatory caps, and China has yet to develop alternatives for savers looking to park their cash elsewhere. The hunt for good returns has over the past decade sparked investment frenzies in property, stamps, mung beans, garlic and tea. Steps to give investors better access to foreign markets and to free up bank rates all aim in the right direction but progress has been halting. Equities were as ripe for a bubble in 2015 as they were in 2007, the last time China experienced a stock frenzy.  If economic stability is not in peril, the best explanation for the interventions is politics. When the stockmarket was soaring, the press cheered the bull run as an endorsement of the economic reforms of the Xi-Li team. Now that it is falling, regulators want to shore up the leadership’s reputation.  It is not just the motive that is dodgy; the nature of the intervention is also unwise. Cutting interest rates as support for the economy when inflation is so low is fair enough. But regulators capped short-selling; pension funds pledged to buy more stocks; the government suspended initial public offerings; and brokers created a fund to buy shares, backed by central-bank cash (see article).  Just as the Communist Party distrusts market forces, so it misunderstands them. Botched attempts to save stocks suggest it is losing control, while a successful rescue would have made buying shares a one-way bet—inflating the bubble still further. One of the persistent illusions about China’s governance is that, whatever its other shortcomings, eminently capable technocrats are in control. Their haplessness in the face of the market turmoil points to a more disconcerting reality.  China is not the first country to prop up a falling stockmarket. Governments and central banks in America, Europe and Japan have form in buying shares after crashes and cutting interest rates to cheer up bloodied investors. What makes China stand out is that it panicked when a correction of clearly overvalued shares had been expected. Rather than calming investors, its barrage of measures screamed of desperation.  Go faster The journey from command to market economy is a long and dangerous one. China has managed it well. But, in financial markets, it still has a long way to go. After the bedlam of this week, it must realise that being partially liberalised presents investors with perverse incentives and policymakers with extraordinary demands. China must not go slow or turn back. That would be the most dangerous path of all. Instead, the real lesson from this week is that it must let the markets decide."

Now, as retail investors grapple with their losses, and the full extent of the rout continues to play out, China Change here translates excerpts from Party media that helped to talk up the disastrous rally.  – The Editor  We’re in an era of great change, and we can’t limit ourselves to the confines of the stock market to understand stocks. To grasp the future development of the stock market, we should see it from the national strategic perspective, and place it in the overall plan of the Chinese dream.  Looking at the stock market from a historical perspective, one should be able to see that our country’s economy and social system are facing a profound transformation. Domestic problems are intertwined and complicated. There is an enormous latent financial crisis, and the stock market must bear the great mission of dissolving this risk. Its role is to gain time for the comprehensive deepening of reform and the upgrading and transformation of the macro-economy. It serves the national strategy of China as a rising great power.  The importance of the stock market’s strategic position is ever increasing in our national strategy, and the government further recognizes its importance with every passing day. [….] With funds rushing in from society, the stock market already possesses the three key ingredients: “strategic need + policy dividends + capital boost.” Going forward, we must resolutely have a positive outlook on the stock market, and investors will be able to look forward to a stock investing opportunity of historic proportions.  — Shanghai Securities Journal, November 20, 2014.  “In 1948, when America rolled out the Marshal Plan, the American dollar gradually became an international currency. From the 1930s, American stocks saw a 75 year bull market! Over the following decades the Chinese stock market will also have ample foundation and conditions to gradually relish the fruits of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation —“the China Dream.”  This time around, the bull market is not a “speculative market” but a “confidence market.” The enormous dividends wrought by the deepening of China’s reform and opening will be enough to support a long term, stable, and growing bull market.  China needs a bull market that surges forth and unfolds on a massive scale. In the 1990s, the A market shouldered the task of state-owned enterprise reform; in the beginning of this century, it carried the great mission of banking reform; and now, it has hoisted the great banner of bringing China through the middle-income trap—honor permits no turning back.  —People’s Daily Online. “The ‘China Dream’ of A Stocks Calls for a Long Bull Market.” December 8, 2014.  “‘Reform Bull’ or ‘Leverage Bull’, there is truth in both. This market rise is a result of high expectations for the dividends of reform and opening up, a result of favorable policies piling atop one another. It is inevitable, and it is reasonable.” —Xiao Gang, chairman of China Securities Regulatory Commission, March 11, 2015.  “Confidence is more important than gold.” Zhang Qun (张群), chief market strategist in the market research team at CITIC Securities, believes that the stock market reacts before the real economy in general. Currently, measures to comprehensively deepen reform are being carried out expeditiously, and the Two Sessions [i.e. the annual assemblies of the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference] have drawn the blueprint for this year’s economic development. All of these factors are injecting market confidence in the stable and healthy operations of the Chinese economy. In addition, financial leverage is also playing an important role in bringing up the stock market as large quantities of funds are being invested.  —Xinhua, March 30, 2015.  The stock market hike conveys an important signal: Chinese economy is still maintaining a stable growth momentum, and its fundamentals haven’t reversed as a result of slowing down. The surge of confidence in the stock market has excited the entire society’s faith in development, and it allows the people to view the new phenomena under the new norm [i.e. China’s hoped-for ‘new economic normal’ of less fixed asset investment, more innovation, and more domestic consumption]  with peace and optimism.  People’s Daily online. March 30, 2015  We unanimously believe that the sudden drop in the stock market imposes enormous financial risks. On the less damaging side, it could lead to the “sudden death” of the stock market and cause severe casualties among the newly emerging middle class who are the nucleus realizing the China Dream. If it becomes more serious, it could trigger doubts about the China Dream, and social instability. It absolutely must not be taken lightly.  [Among our recommendations] Immediately form the Central Government Financial Committee, and establish a joint command comprised of one bank (POBC), three commissions (CBRC, CSRC, CIRC), and one office (CAC). The 1-3-1 must work as a fist under unified leadership to coordinate actions and prepare for a long-term battle. Party Central must command finance the way it commands the gun barrel. In the end, it should establish a Central Finance Commission, similar to the Central Military Commission, according to the needs of modern financial soft war.  “Five Professors Call for Rescuing the Market,” Tencent Finance. July 2, 2015  This morning, deputy minister of the Ministry of Public Security Meng Qingfeng (孟庆丰) arrived at the China Securities Regulatory Commission with an entourage trailing behind him. They will work together with the CSRC in investigating leads on malicious short selling in stocks and stock indexes in recent weeks.

If you tell yourself this, it will become true, when in actual fact we all learned our native languages, and as long as you have the ability to listen, read, and speak, then you can learn a language just as well as anyone else, except for maybe the odd idiot savant genius.  I know a lot of people that have learned Chinese to a high level of fluency, and what almost all of them have in common is an interest in and/or fascination with the language, and they all worked extremely hard.  Ability doesn't mean anything, the person who goes to Chinese class 4 hours a day, goes home and studies hanzi for four hours, then hangs out with Chinese people in the evening will improve, no matter what.   I'll have about a year of Chinese under my belt ... But the thing is, I'm far from being at a level to have any kind of meaningful conversation.   Again, you are being self-defeating. A year of Chinese is more than enough to be conversational. After a month of serious study you should be able to bumble your way through social interactions with non-English speakers, and you will improve rapidly.   How do you become proficient in Chinese when your Chinese is far worse than their English?   There are hundreds of millions of people in China with English worse than your Chinese.

Avoid English speakers.  If all else fails, get some Korean friends. They're there to study Chinese too and will usually be at a higher level than you. I learnt a lot of my Chinese from Koreans."
China,3cqavs,Gravys,5,Fri Jul 10 00:17:08 2015 UTC,"Class and study are important, you won't progress substantially without them, but....  GET OFF CAMPUS. My experience has been that Uni campuses and education institutions are filled with people desperate to practice their English. However hard you/they try, you'll always be able to easily slip into English.   TRAVEL. I've always found my Chinese improves after travel. You are forced into difficult language situations, get into conversations with taxi drivers, locals, fellow travelers, and it's often more inspiring anyway.   GIVE UP ON DEEP MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS. I don't mean this in a harsh way, but don't expect to come to china and get into deep discussions about history, philosophy or politics armed only with your 1 year of Chinese. Being able to have 'superficial' conversations about yourself, your hobbies, your interests and getting things done without problems in Chinese is an amazing achievement already.   LEARN HOW TO SAY ""IM RUSSIAN"". It's a cliche, but one that helps. As soon as someone starts speaking English to you, tell them (in Chinese) that your are Russian/Spanish/Dutch/Swedish and can't speak English. It works.   DO THINGS. If you have the money, do things. Buy a scooter, plan a barbecue, get a cat, whatever. Doing things forces you to learn the language, and puts you in contact with people who share your interests (not just other students who will probably want to learn Englissh).   I don't believe that avoiding foreigners is necessary, but just be careful that you don't structure your life around the crowd of foreigners that has no interaction with china. I have a group of friends who all speak good Chinese, and it's helpful and inspiration/motivation.   Contrary to what other people have said: don't watch tv. It's shit, they speak too fast, and you won't be able to keep up. Use proper language learning materials (like chinesepod) suited to your ability. Don't neglect your writing/reading - you'll struggle to make serious progress - but also don't get caught up in hand-writing: being able to recognize characters and type them in your phone/computer is enough. Chatting with people (yeah, girls...) on QQ or wechat is excellent language practice."

China,3cqavs,westiseast,6,Fri Jul 10 05:36:57 2015 UTC,"Friend, if you are at that low of a level that your Chinese is worse than their awful English, just keep going to class and study. You'll learn the grammar quickly enough unless you're severely grammar retarded, because Chinese has almost zero grammar. Just imitate people. Walk around and imitate them, talk to yourself, try and get their tones down, don't say anything original just answer with what you've heard said.  I came here without a lick of Chinese, studied in school for 1.5 years, and now it's been 3.5 years. My Chinese is pretty good and I've been told my accent and tones are very accurate. Just imitate the locals and go to class - with just a year under your belt you really need to just keep learning the foundational stuff. Don't sweat it, just have fun."

China,3cqavs,nimbleal,2,Fri Jul 10 03:06:11 2015 UTC,"Find people who don't speak English, naturally!  With a will, there's a way. If you don't feel like you can comfortable socialize in a natural social environment because of awkwardness, just plain hire someone to be your captive conversation partner.  The real hump isn't proficiency per se, it's boredom caused by not yet being at a high enough level to do anything interesting with the language. Unfortunately the only way through this is to just keep trucking. Read, read, read, listen, listen, listen. And speak as much as possible.  I highly recommend that you focus on avoiding your own language. If you're really serious about it, try to make as many hours of every day and as many days of every week as possible ""English free."" Want to read a book? Make it a Chinese book (or your Chinese textbook, if you're not at that level yet). Want to watch TV? Make it Chinese TV (kids' programming if you're a total beginner). Want to go out and socialize? Make it socializing with Chinese people (or a paid date with a language tutor if no-one wants to socialize with you in Chinese for free because your skills aren't up to scratch yet).  That's really all there is to it. Consider it like learning to play an instrument. When you see people on TV who are piano or violin whizzes, think how did they do it? By being obsessive. By doing it as much as humanly possible all the time. Language-learning is very much the same; you will get out what you put in."

Though, given that you've already got some Chinese under your belt, I doubt that will be a issue/confusion for you.  I came here with essentially zero, and made the mistake of busting my butt to speak to people, only to find out that the local dialect in the middle of nowhere where I live (colloquially called ""Tier-88"" on /r/china) is so different that even Chinese working at my company here still have serious issues understanding the locals...despite many years of working/living here.  Shit, my fiance IS a local, and even she has issues with some of the people around here when we head out into ""the sticks"" to explore.  It's really like another language."
China,3cqavs,Regional_King,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:01:29 2015 UTC,So what are the main differences in the local language that make it hard to understand. I imagine the basic words are the same. Are they using a lot of what English might call slang?
China,3cqavs,Sasselhoff,2,Sat Jul 11 00:25:13 2015 UTC,"No, it's not really ""slang"", because it's ""their language""...some of the words aren't even close (but some are, like vinegar is ""cu4"" in Mandarin, here it's ""chu4"", that's not that far off).  And it totally depends on what city you are in.  Quite literally, every single city has it's own dialect.  The next town over is only about 30km away, but they speak a different dialect.   However, some are closer or farther away from Mandarin...for instance, Beijing (obviously) and Dongbei have ""local"" languages that are almost exactly Mandarin.  Shanghai?  Very different.  My city?  Almost a different language, and I'm not kidding, had a buddy here who studies languages as a hobby...total polygot, speaks 7 languages, four of them fluently, the other three almost...he said it was so different it could almost be considered a different language.  BUT, that is just anecdotal, so take it as you may.  And then of course in Shenzhen/Guangzhou many (and almost all in HK) actually do speak a different language, Cantonese (but I'm sure you know that).  The best way I could describe it (in my city at least) wouldn't be like a Boston accent or a ""Southern"" accent (Texas, Alabama, NC, etc) but more like a New Orleans/Louisiana Cajun ""patois"".  I could barely understand some of the folks down there when I visited for a few days...I figure that's more how it is for my Chinese colleagues, as they literally can't understand many of the people here at all."

If you are talking to Chinese people who don't speak good English then at one point after like 10-15 minutes there will be a communication breakdown between you. When they know all the basics about you they will start asking you harder questions of which you do not understand or don't know how to answer to. The only thing you can do is keep looking up words on your phone. However, if you are out with people who speak better English you can keep asking them, 'Oh, so how to say this sentence or word in Chinese then?' I found even though they prefer speaking English, when you ask them questions like how to say this or that they will be happy to answer and explain the meaning of the word to you.  Also you should download Pimsleur and Glossika, they are great programs in the form of audio books that drill Chinese sentence patterns into you through repetition. Don't be shy, if there are people who keep staring at you while you are waiting for something that's an invitation for you to start talking to them, you just say something like 'Hai hao ma?' and then they will happily continue chatting with you for a while, you will see."

If there's ever a word that comes up in conversation that you don't know and need to use, look it up and use it next time. I find that this really helps to keep the words in your long-term memory.  As for reading and writing, it really is rote memorization and repetition for the most part. Besides the academic material that you'll be given, I personally find that watching kid shows in Chinese and transcribing the text will help keep things simple and provide context for certain characters and help you learn."

The Chinese government did all sorts of desperate measures including basically arm-twisting companies and major shareholders into not selling and forcing them to buy more, not to mention ordering the pension fund to invest in stocks and halting half the market. The government has thus shown how impressive their power is, and conversely, how devoid of credibility they are.

Basically, an MBA is really only as strong and valuable as its brand, and its alumni network. So, if you just want to kick around S.E.Asia/China, then one of the JV's (or whatever they call those joint programs) or a straight China MBA might be adequate. It will never be a blue chip mba, and it won't have a lot of name brand recognition outside of SEA, but it will be adequate as a starting point in the region.  But, if you hope to go more international, or head back to your home country at some point, it won't have the same value.  it won't HURT you, I wouldn't think, but nor will it open doors, or blow the roof off the salary cap you are facing either."

It's not like an engineering or medical degree where, once you obtain it, you've got a fairly decent skill base that is required to practise in your given field. An MBA is a much looser and more general area of study. I'm sure it helps running certain business units, but it's definitely not essential knowledge.   IMO if you're looking at a ""second tier"" school or lower, there are much better/more cost effective options (like a Diploma of Applied Finance, or even just getting a job with a big company and seeing if they will sponsor your MBA after a few years)."

However, we could be seeing a reversal of this trend with a de facto wealth transfer back to ordinary citizens from SOEs. If retail investors start liquidating their positions, their resulting gains would have been funded from SOE coffers/balance sheets!   Interesting theory. If true, I wonder what the long-term consequences will be. If you're a company forced to unravel your profits, you're probably unlikely to venture back into the market in future.

At his combatant status review tribunal, a type of military court, Muhamman acknowledged that he’d been a weapons trainer at a camp under Abdul Haq, a fellow Uighur who was a top lieutenant to al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, Joscelyn said. Abdul Haq was killed in a drone strike in Pakistan’s North Waziristan in early 2010, he added."

China,3com7z,cainiaowu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:39:05 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Great_Depression   Current theories may be broadly classified into two main points of view and several heterodox points of view.  First, there are demand-driven theories, from Keynesian and Institutional economists who argue that the depression was caused by a widespread loss of confidence that lead to underconsumption. The demand-driven theories argue that the financial crisis following the 1929 crash led to a sudden and persistent reduction in consumption and investment spending.[1] Once panic and deflation set in, many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets. Holding money therefore became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods, exacerbating the drop in demand.  Second, there are the monetarists, who believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession, but that significant policy mistakes by monetary authorities (especially the Federal Reserve), caused a shrinking of the money supply which greatly exacerbated the economic situation, causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression. Related to this explanation are those who point to debt deflation causing those who borrow to owe ever more in real terms."
China,3com7z,xiongmao2go,0,Fri Jul 10 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, dumbass, look back a few years to the depression of 1920-21.  It was harder and sharper than 1929, and the goverment interference in the free market was -- wait for it -- zero.  The federal u.s. goverment did nothing.  The federal reserve did nothing.  The free market corrected the excesses and by the time the new president had gathered together a gaggle of ""experts"" the problem had resolved itself.    It's only in 1929 we see the kind of insane, childish, spineless banking-government-central bank cartel attempt to ""fix"" the problem that made the market's reaction far, far worse.    Free markets doesn't mean nobody gets hurt... it means the government doesn't get to pick the winners.  In the case of the CCP, that would be a very good thing.

China,3cqtug,Australosaurus,4,Fri Jul 10 01:08:43 2015 UTC,"by Mark Magnier and Jeremy Page  President Xi Jinping got the credit as China’s stock markets revved up. Now their unraveling is inviting rare finger-pointing at his forceful rule and putting his far-reaching economic goals at risk.  Vibrant stock markets are at the center of Mr. Xi’s plans for an economic makeover, intended to help companies offload huge debts, reinvigorate lethargic state enterprises and entice more foreign investment. Some economists called reviving the moribund markets among his most consequential reforms in the more than two years since coming to power. Investor blogs talked of “the Uncle Xi bull market.”  But with the markets having lost around a third of their value in the past month, and the government appearing to panic in its response to the drop, some people are starting to voice doubts about Mr. Xi’s autocratic leadership style.  Sun Liping, a sociologist at Tsinghua University, took to his social-media account to say the stock-market crash has exposed crucial flaws in Mr. Xi’s highly centralized approach to government, including a lack of financial expertise and a pervasive instinct among subordinates to obey superiors.  “Power has limits,” he wrote.  The criticisms amount to a rare backlash for a leader with an eye for publicity and who so commandingly put his stamp on the Communist Party, the military, economic policy and other areas. At the same time, Mr. Xi is facing resistance from officials and the business community upset with the slowing economy and how he has tried to concentrate power in his hands, among other policies.  Although Mr. Xi faces no immediate challenge to his authority, there is a risk that the stock market crisis could trigger social unrest and hamper his efforts to promote key allies at the next big leadership reshuffle in 2017. His government has placed a priority on quashing dissent and unrest, and recently passed a law that broadly defines national security threats to preserve the party’s leadership.  The sudden doubt in China’s leadership threatens to undermine Mr. Xi’s broad-ranging agenda to keep raising standards of living and transition to consumer economy.  “The market selloff is definitely the largest challenge that the new administration has faced,” said Victor Shih, a China expert at the University of California, San Diego. Chief among the weaknesses exposed, Mr. Shih said, was the ineffectiveness of Mr. Xi’s pledge to limit bureaucratic interference and give markets greater scope.  “He’s trumpeted reform for the past couple of years but a lot of so-called reforms have gone out the window with this dramatic, dramatic government intervention in recent days,” Mr. Shih said.  The government’s scattershot efforts, which have included cutting interest rates and ordering state-run companies and brokerages to buy and hold stocks, appeared to make headway Thursday after floundering for weeks. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 5.8%, the biggest daily gain in six years, while other indexes saw smaller rises. On Thursday, Chinese police visited the nation’s stock regulator and vowed to investigate any market manipulation.  Just how damaging the stock meltdown ends up being for Mr. Xi will depend on how quickly the market recovers and whether Beijing summons the unity to marshal its significant resources. The administration still has some $4 trillion in foreign reserves, and its policies to promote innovation and entrepreneurship offers a road map out of the slow-growth morass for many ordinary Chinese, said Cheng Li, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution and author of a book on Chinese leadership.  “This is a very critical period, a test of public confidence, leadership capacity and how the international community views China,” Mr. Li said. “This week is pretty bad and if it lasts a few more weeks, it will be terrible, but we need to see how it unfolds.”  Mr. Xi took charge in late 2012, presiding over a group of leaders and senior officials applauded by China’s elite for wanting to shake things up. His central-bank governor and finance minister have argued for relying more on market forces and loosening controls on currency and cross-border investments.  A potential casualty of the concerted intervention, some economists said, is Beijing’s goal of getting the yuan named as a global reserve currency when the IMF conducts a review late this year. The effort relies on opening financial markets wider to foreign investors, whose confidence in the wake of the massive stock-market intervention has yet to be gauged.  One of Mr. Xi’s most popular policies, an anticorruption campaign against party officials high and low, has also run into headwinds. Businesses and even other Chinese leaders complain that the purge is paralyzing the bureaucracy, frustrating companies trying to gain approvals for projects. It has also antagonized some senior party figures who feel it is splitting their ranks and distracting the leadership’s attention from the economy.  That’s why, some political insiders said, that the trial of Zhou Yongkang, the former security chief and most senior figure caught in the antigraft campaign, was held in secret and given little play in state media at its conclusion.  Also battling from within are influential state industries that dominate large swaths of the economy and which have managed to delay the government from issuing broad guidelines for consolidation. Much of that reform program is premised on selling more shares to the public and converting corporate debt to equity, reforms that economists said are being setback by the efforts to stabilize the markets.  Some economists said driving Beijing’s aggressive prop-up of the markets is fear of contagion and social instability as accounts fueled by debt started to rapidly lose value. Many of those hit hardest in the past few weeks have been individual investors with relatively small accounts—the majority of Chinese investors—some of whom have bought stocks on margin or with proceeds from real estate, another area hard hit by the economic slowdown.  A 26-year-old graduate student at Peking University who would give only his surname, Zhou, said he has lost around 50,000 yuan [$8,050] on stocks in the past few weeks, leaving him depressed and scrimping on meals. Mr. Zhou, who asked not to use his first name since his parents don’t know he has been trading in stocks, said he blames the steep decline on the government, which did little to temper frenzied buying, and on state media for playing cheerleader.  “The People’s Daily made things worse by saying that the 4,000 level was just the beginning of the bull market,” Mr. Zhou said. “50,000 yuan is a big deal for a student. Some of this was money my parents gave me for my wedding.” On Thursday, the Shanghai market closed at 3709.33."

If retail investors en masse start unwinding leveraged positions because they're back to a small profit, things could devolve quickly. If the popular sentiment is that the government will get the market up to 6000, it could stabilize (no one selling, but no one buying either).   It does lead to an interesting point: the majority of entities buying right now are companies buying their own stock using loans from banks, by direction of the government. If things don't go as planned, we could see a number of companies owning huge chunks of what is supposedly free floating stock. Many companies could go private; as well, if stocks continue to fall from here, the systemic risk for banks is potentially MASSIVE."

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), in addition to a range of regulatory responses, has made investigations into the possible manipulation of financial stocks through short selling schemes a top enforcement priority. Director of Enforcement Linda Thomsen has vowed to subject to “the full force of the law” anyone who engages in “abusive short selling, market manipulation, and false rumor mongering....”  Similarly, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has compared short sellers in the current market turmoil to “looters after a hurricane,” and promised to intensify his own investigation of short selling abuses.  Effective October 17, 2008, the SEC adopted new rule 10b-21, a “naked” short selling antifraud rule. In a “naked” short sale, the seller does not borrow or arrange to borrow securities in time to make delivery to the purchaser during the standard three-day settlement period. Rule 10b-21 was intended specifically to address “abusive naked short selling,” in which the short seller intentionally deceives other participants about its intention or ability to deliver shares. Thus, rule 10b-21 provides that it shall constitute a “manipulative or deceptive device” under section 10(b) “for any person to submit an order to sell an equity security if such person deceives a broker or dealer, a participant of a registered clearing agency, or a purchaser about its intention or ability to deliver the security on or before the settlement date, and such person fails to deliver the security on or before the settlement date.” See Naked Short Selling Antifraud Rule, SEC Rel. No. 34-58774, 2008 SEC LEXIS 2318 at 2-3 (Oct. 14, 2008).    BTW, China doesn't allow ""naked short sales"" either."

Result:  they can't do much legal short selling in China.  If someone outside of China is making ""2.9 million"" short selling Chinese futures, it begs the question of whether he/she is doing ""naked short selling"".  There are also significant restrictions on short selling in China.  See for example:  http://www.hkex.com.hk/eng/market/partcir/sehk/2015/Documents/CT00415E2.pdf"

China,3cs57z,TheMediumPanda,5,Fri Jul 10 12:47:47 2015 UTC,"Contact a local LGBT group or non profit. They should have a good knowledge of age/culture-appropriate resources that you can make use of. Most likely the best you can do is make them aware that gay people exist and they're not evil/bad. No reason to discuss the mechanics of sex directly.  My sex-ed class was in 5th grade, so about 9-10 years old. We went over anatomy and what sorts of changes we should expect (separate boys/girls classes) but that's about it."

I am a ☭true communist☭, and I  believe that stock markets is a instrument for a few elite to make profits and enrich themselves while basically doing nothing. It's basically a way to gamble.  My view is that a lot of people view stock markets as a way to profit without doing anything. Some of them understand their gambling probability better than others who did not make business school. Still, both view it as ethical while I view it as gambling = Satan.  So as you see I probably have the same views on the stock markets than the toddlers I'm teaching :) So anyway, why should I give a fuck?

I have been lucky with landlords but have you ever met some real piece of crap who harassed his way out a good tenant to keep the deposit, make you pay the rent earlier or somehow increase the bills. I always hear these stories from fellows. The reason for that is probably because your rent payments are supporting a bunch of ex-farmers who consider themselves too good to work.

But I'll explain why it's data is not accurate/informative.  From what they say, they get their data from their ""honey pots""(I have no idea what ""sensors"" mean in this context, switch/routers maybe?)  Meaning, they have to have servers in a country to be able to see attacks to that country. So if it's hard for them to set up ""honey pots"" in a country, then their data will show there's little attack on the said country.   Since by far US is the easiest country to sign up for servers. You would see lots of attacking US."

So you have to take few steps backwards, improve your shit, get some growth, and attract people back.  In a socialist system (with Chinese characteristics?), instead of companies going bankrupt, the state comes in to decide which companies go bust and which might get bought out/saved/nationalized by the state.

I'm not at all saying that ending the Cultural Revolution was a bad thing, but I am saying that it could have been done without sending the country down a destructive path of rampant capitalism.

I tend not to like saying it's a euphemism, it's just a term that's come into common use to describe that type of economic organization. Sure it tends to be authoritarian, but I try to use as neutral terms as possible if I'm just trying to describe things more technically.  Edit: ""education"" to ""economic"" because typing on a phone is a pain."
China,3ck30z,jewish-mel-gibson,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:43:16 2015 UTC,"Norway probably has more state-owned enterprises that make up a significantly greater percentage of their economy than China does, or any other country, for that matter, barring perhaps the DPRK and Cuba.  Free market capitalism was a poor choice of words. Capitalism will suffice. The point being, state-owned enterprises does not a socialist state make.  And there are different definitions of state capitalism that vary depending on who you are talking to. In Marxism-Leninism, and therefore in this context, state capitalism means employing capitalist techniques in state-owned enterprises in order to strengthen the state, and thus the socialist project. The reason I call this a euphemism for outright capitalism is that privatizing huge sectors of the economy is a far cry from simply buying low and selling high. That is, when Xiaoping is all ""socialism with Chinese characteristics"", I (and any other person who hasn't lost their facilities of sight) strongly believe this means ""new plan: capitalism, but only the people we like will benefit, but we're still socialist...wink wink."""
China,3ck30z,fununclebob,2,Thu Jul 9 01:49:58 2015 UTC,The difference is that in most countries state-owned firms play by the same rules as the market.

It was a poor tradeoff. In successful countries state firms are instruments of public policy which intervene in a limited, targeted manner to help those who most need it.  SOEs may sometimes carry the economy when the private sector is underperforming, but they do not dominate the market because they are inevitably wasteful. Cuba for example is very inefficient with what little tax money it's able to squeeze out of people."

China,3cjek1,hydr0xide,4,Wed Jul 8 13:46:24 2015 UTC,"That's what I plan to do as soon as my old company pays me (it's my ""pension"" fund, apparently they've reclaimed the money and I'm just waiting for the company to transfer to it my account).  Not a huge amount but I certainly wouldn't want to lose it!"
China,3cjek1,zakazaw,2,Wed Jul 8 13:48:35 2015 UTC,"So was this ""pension fund"" deducted from your salary monthly? Sorry if it seems an obvious question but I'd like to check since I didn't have anything deducted from my salary for this so I'm wondering does that mean I don't need to ask about the pension fund."
China,3cjek1,hydr0xide,3,Wed Jul 8 14:05:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, my payslip had a line item for 社保个人 representing how much was taken from my salary (about 5%).  I think the company also makes a contribution on top of that (maybe 1-2%) but this can't be reclaimed when you leave the country, so it's basically just an additional tax."
China,3cjek1,zakazaw,3,Wed Jul 8 14:33:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, then I didn't contribute to this since my company didn't deduct anything for this. Then again, my company was also breaking the law, not that I mind."
China,3cjek1,hydr0xide,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:00:53 2015 UTC,"didn't    IIRC the company is legally required to do this, so if they havent been deducting it, then they are breaking the law.

The same financial restrictions that make the stock market merely a casino with little basis on actual economics make it unlikely to cause much discomfort elsewhere in the economy.  The banks will have some more NPLs due to it, but they are very good at cooking the books so that NPLs get buried, and it's just a drop in the bucket compared to what already exists."
China,3cjek1,Azarka,8,Wed Jul 8 14:43:16 2015 UTC,"Some rough back-of-the-envelope calculations suggests that the drop in the market is about 9% of China's total debt in (so in other words, if all those shares were bought on margin, total debt will have increased by 9%).  Not insignificant, but also not a huge amount, you're right.  However when total debt is already at 250% of GDP (and both debt/GDP are heavily linked to a falling property market) you really have to wonder whether the house of cards is about to start falling down."
China,3cjek1,hydr0xide,5,Wed Jul 8 14:53:32 2015 UTC,"Luckily the Chinese financial market is underdeveloped, so financial contagion should be unlikely.  That said, the CCP might be forced to join the rest of the world with QE.  Fun times and opportunities ahead, folks!"

They're on record encouraging people to invest, what's the average Zhou going to think when they lose their life savings because they bought in at the height of the bubble, at the government's behest? It's also going to discourage people from spending in general, which is a major problem for a society trying to transition into a consumer society and dodge the middle income trap.

China,3cjxb7,fly2me,9,Wed Jul 8 23:37:48 2015 UTC,"tl;dr - High personal savings, median age over 35, low fertility, high house prices, crony capitalism. Very similar to Japan in 1990.  It might go the same way as Japan. Similar age structure. The government is more likely to try to keep the plates spinning than the more American response.  Over a few months - probably a cycle of bailouts, stimulus, then further crashes and companies being forced to admit they've been deep in the red for some time.  Obviously, that's a doom and gloom scenario. The stock market isn't that big a part of China's economy. It might burn retail investors, forcing margin calls. That could flow on to a downturn, revealing companies to be overly indebted. But you'd have the government doing everything they can to keep that from happening.  http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/01/06/reference/lessons-from-when-the-bubble-burst/   The period between roughly 1985 and 1990 was a time of unparalleled prosperity in Japan. But it was also a gilded age defined by opulence, corruption, extravagance and waste. When the bubble economy years ended, Japan entered a prolonged slump from which it has yet to fully recover.  When did the bubble economy begin and when did it end?  Economic historians usually date the beginning of the bubble economy in September 1985, when Japan and five other nations signed the Plaza Accord in New York. That agreement called for the depreciation of the dollar against the yen and was supposed to increase U.S. exports by making them cheaper.  But it also made it cheaper for Japanese companies to purchase foreign assets. And they went on an overseas buying spree, picking off properties like the Rockefeller Center in New York and golf courses in Hawaii and California.  By December 1989, the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average had reached nearly 39,000. But beginning in 1990, the stock market began a downward spiral that saw it lose more than $2 trillion by December 1990, effectively ending the bubble era.  What was the cause of the bubble economy?  The dollar became cheaper just as Japan was reaching the height of its economic prowess in manufacturing and at a time when most Japanese had huge amounts of personal savings.  The Bank of Japan had lowered interest rates from 5 percent in 1985 to 2.5 percent by early 1987.  Japanese banks, which had previously lent mostly to corporations, now had ample funds to lend at a time when their major corporate customers were flush with cash thanks to their trade surpluses and the availability of worldwide equity markets, which competed directly with Japanese banks.  So the banks began freely lending to Japanese firms and individuals, who purchased real estate, which increased the paper value of land assets. This created a vicious cycle in which land was used as collateral to obtain further loans, which were then used to speculate on the stock market or to purchase more land. This drove up the paper value of land further, while the banks continued to grant loans based on the overvalued land as collateral.  There was little questioning by either the government or the banks themselves over how the loans would be repaid or what would happen once land values started dropping.  What was Japan like during those years?  For many people, it was one big, expensive party.  The frugality and austerity that defined the country during the postwar era gave way to extravagance and conspicuous consumption. Stories of housewives in Nara sipping $500 cups of coffee sprinkled with gold dust or businessmen spending tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo’s flashy restaurants and nightclubs were legion.  One nightclub in particular, Julianna’s Tokyo, become the symbol for the flashy, party lifestyle of the entire era.  Japan’s inflated land prices made global headlines.  The Imperial Palace was reported to be worth more than France. A ¥10,000 note dropped in Tokyo’s Ginza district was worth less than the tiny amount of ground it covered.  It was also a period of increased international travel, as Japanese went to the United States, Europe and Oceania in record numbers, shopping for Louis Vuitton and Gucci handbags, Seville Row and Armani suits, and the finest wines.  Trips were often made after dropping millions of yen at English conversation schools in posh buildings with fake Van Gogh paintings on the walls and fish tanks in the lobbies.  The bubble economy attracted Westerners by the planeload, who made fortunes at foreign banks and brokerages, or at least good money teaching English.  Changes in the immigration law in 1990 also allowed Brazilians of Japanese descent to settle in Japan and work in the factories that were facing a labor shortage as younger workers sought higher paying white-collar jobs in Tokyo or Osaka.  What happened after the party ended?  After the crash in late 1990, economic growth stalled and newspapers were filled with stories of businesses going bankrupt.  Corrupt deals involving the yakuza and senior executives at Japan’s largest, most venerable banks and brokerages came to light. Corporations essentially stopped investing and consumers curbed their spending. Housing loan corporations, known as “jusen,” started to go bankrupt, and then the larger banks were forced to merge to consolidate their mounting bad loans.  Various government-sponsored fiscal and economic stimulus measures, including trillions of yen in failed public works projects, did nothing to revive the economy. This led to what has been dubbed Japan’s lost decade, starting roughly in 1991, when the effects of the stock market crash became clear. The carnage lasted until around 2000 or 2001, after the banks had been bailed out with taxpayer funds, much corporate restructuring had taken place and the growth of the Chinese economy provided manufacturers some relief."

Especially if you're a mom and pop type operation who can't afford to lose.  When the recovery occurs you can bring the USD back.  Yes you'll lose some money in the conversion and transfer costs, but consider that insurance. Plus if/when there is a recovery it just means you'll make a smaller profit, but you still make a profit.  Always protect a core reserve.  Euros are also fine once the Greek issues are settled.  Pounds as well.  I think USD is the best right now though in that we had our kick in the balls in 2008 and have been chugging along since.  The Euro currencies are getting a somewhat moderate kick in the balls currently via Greece.  Total Greek debt versus the total size of the EU is not that worrisome, but it's like an ugly fart lingering in the room. Probably going down.  So obviously their current apartment is going to lose value, but the one they want to purchase should also get cheap.  At this point for housing live within one's means and purchase because it improves quality of life as opposed to investment property related motivation.  The big concern would be borrowing lots of money and then getting laid off or a pay cut and having issues paying the bank.  I actually just encouraged my in laws to purchase in that it meant they kept money out of the stock market by using it for the house and they bought in a very desirable part of town.  I expect their property value to drop (meaning had they waited they could have gotten it for less), but they don't need immediate equity and plan to live for the rest of their lives.  I figure either they'll have equity on it in a couple of years due to the fact it's going to be one of the first areas in the city to recover or China will totally shit the bed and they'll finally agree to move to America, I win either way.

There are issues with payment and who the visa is attached to (school or firm). This is something that has been cracked down on more recently so fewer firms are providing these opportunities. Depending on your visa arrangement you may be able to get a legitimate work visa (after your student visa) for those 2 months if you can find a firm willing to hire you for that short of a time.  As a few others mentioned focusing on intensive Chinese study is a great option.

China,3ci9hi,aznaggie,3,Wed Jul 8 09:07:38 2015 UTC,"二百五分 is commonly used.  两百五 is also commonly used but it is cannon that the unit of measurement is ""塊"", not cents.  Also, for people who don't understnad, the Chinese currency hierarchy goes like this in the traditional sense: 元角毛分文  1元=10角  1角=10毛  1毛=10分  1分=10文  Obviously, in modern China, 1角=1毛, where 1角=100分, somehow the conversion of 角 and 毛 is gone, but people still understands.  Therefore, 250分 means 2.5mao, half of wumao that is the amount paid to paid internet commentators who are paid by the CCP to monitor and sway internet discussions."

No doubt the well-connected are quietly unloading their shares while everyone else watches in horror as their assets are frozen.

Not very big since most people walk, ride bikes, drive cars, or take public transport.  If speculators buy a lot of shares in this company and the price drives up really high, but the return on investment is so small that the profit divided amongst shares ends up being infinitesimally small per share because there are too many people investing in such a small market company.  It's dumb, pointless, and a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money.   Same idea that caused the western economic crash of 2008, same idea causing the Chinese economic crash now.

China,3cjasc,zakazaw,2,Wed Jul 8 18:50:04 2015 UTC,"Got downvoted hard for my previous reply so I'll try again.  The Chinese govt treats Taiwanese better than vice versa because it is a much stronger and larger nation that claims Taiwan as part of its own, therefore not only does it have nothing to fear from Taiwan, but it needs to try to attract and persuade Taiwanese to live, work and embrace China. Taiwan as a much smaller and weaker nation is in the opposite situation and needs to guard against any influx of mainlanders in immigrating or working in Taiwan due to security concerns.  Some Chinese people may treat Taiwanese better than vice versa because they are conditioned by communist education and nationalist feelings to believe that Taiwan belongs to and is part of China. As such, many of them see Taiwanese as more wealthier and cultured countrymen and foster a sense of idealism and fondness for Taiwanese people, food and pop culture.  Inversely, Taiwanese have grown up knowing that a huge, belligerent, authoritarian country next door claims them, threatens military force, and refuses to let the world treat Taiwan as a country. Trust me, no Taiwanese under the age of 70 believes that China belongs to Taiwan or that Taiwan needs to reclaim China. As such, many Taiwanese have a sense of outrage, frustration and fear against China which they take out on mainlanders by having an arrogant and dismissive attitude.   In any case, this is no different than what many HKers, Singaporeans, Japanese and Koreans think about mainlanders. Even the Thais are starting to be like that too, judging from their reactions to misbehaving Chinese tourists."
China,3cjasc,dream208,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:06:39 2015 UTC,"I am Taipeiness under 70 years old. I do not agree your assessment. Pro-independence voice is strong among the youth, but it is hardly the only voice out there."
China,3cjasc,zakazaw,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:24:41 2015 UTC,So do you think China belongs to Taiwan? Please explain what you think.
China,3cjasc,dream208,0,Thu Jul 9 15:56:43 2015 UTC,"First of all, I think our perception what ""China"" is different here. For me, mainland, Taiwan, HK, Penghu, Hainan, are only parts of China but not China itself. The way you phrasing here is equivalent of saying ""America belongs to Hawai'i/Texas"".  So the better question here is ""do I believe Republic of China is a better government than People's Republic of China for China as a whole?"" The answer here is yes, but I prefer both of them reformat into a new system of government IF reunification dose occur.   I also believe R.O.C.'s existence, however weak it might appear to be, serves as a counter-balance to P.R.C. in the Chinese collective conscious ala - ""the communist party does not define China along, there are alternative of Chinese government/community out there.""   In the grand scheme of things, a truly meaningful and relatively peaceful reform in the mainland is far more likely taking place than not when R.O.C. exists across the straight than an independent Taiwan riddled with Anti-Chinese sentiment.   Lastly a more personal note, I identify with Republic of China, not imaginative ""Republic of Taiwan"", in term of politics. Identity wise, I identify with Taipeinese and Chinese more than Taiwanese, but I do not think of them as exclusive identities. I fully understand and ""respect"" (if it is mutual) the pro-independence sentiment, but it does not speak for me."
China,3cjasc,zakazaw,0,Fri Jul 10 02:13:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's different. You see a unified China or pan-China union that includes both the PRC and Taiwan. Unfortunately that is a complete fantasy. There is no way Taiwan can form a union with the PRC and thrive and no reason why it would want to. Firstly, like it or not, Taiwan has become a separate nation with its own government, systems, customs and identity. Yes, Mandarin is the main language, but so is Taiwanese. The culture is mainly Chinese, but much of it has been separate from the mainland for hundreds of years.   The PRC may see ROC as something to study but they won't follow it. Despite their economic boom up until a year ago, the PRC didn't loosen freedoms, instead it increased them. As the economy worsens, the Chinese government will continue to increase its crackdowns and repression.    So basically you were born and raised in Taipei, Taiwan but refuse to acknowledge your own country?"
China,3cjasc,dream208,2,Fri Jul 10 16:07:17 2015 UTC,"My country is Republic of China, not Taiwan. All nation spawns from imaginative fantasy, it is up to you to choose which you identify with. In this case, I choose a nation that actually exist and does not hate my Chinese heritage instead of another imaginative construct (a Taiwan nation) that loath my family's background and pride. P.R.C. does not factor into this, yet. I don't think it is unreasonable at all.   The more dangerous way thinking here is seeing ""Taiwan"" as an unchangeable whole. It is nothing more than an artificial name given to this piece of land.  No more, no less. And a person living on that land can choose to identify with the name or not."
China,3cjasc,zakazaw,0,Fri Jul 10 18:08:39 2015 UTC,"ROC is Taiwan and has been for the past 60 years. If mainland China ever becomes democratic and the CCP is gone, it still would not be the ROC. I think you have things mixed up because what you perceive as as just a ""piece of land"" is a functional country with its own government and society. What you identify is an artificial construct based on idealistic and non-realistic factors. If this was the 1950s, your idea would make sense. This is 2015, get with the times."
China,3cjasc,dream208,2,Sat Jul 11 03:14:51 2015 UTC,"In term of identity, I do not think ""Taiwan"" is more tangible than ""R.O.C."". Both are just names. In my eyes, this land is part of China ruled by a Chinese government. And since I choose to identify as a Chinese, I have no problem to recognize R.O.C. as my nationality.   And since when is identity a thing of a trend? Do you abandon something you identify with so easily because of others around you do so? or because some political party told you so? or when someone on the facebook telling you that a newly fabricated identity is cooler?   For me at least, my identity is my own, constructed basing on my own experience, my own judgement and my own history, nothing more."
China,3cjasc,zakazaw,0,Sat Jul 11 04:13:54 2015 UTC,"To each his own. Continue with your own identity, but I predict you will be in for a major disappointment as time goes on. Identity is not a trend. Do you think it's a trend for those Taiwanese patriots? I'm pretty sure being a patriot of your own country and society is more than just because a political party convinced you.   What is your China experience? Have you ever lived in China? I also had a similar vision in the past but when I went to China and saw the reality, I had to face up to facts."
China,3cjasc,zakazaw,-9,Sat Jul 11 04:23:23 2015 UTC,Of course they do. That's because China is the one claiming Taiwan as its own territory and has military forces and missiles ready to attack if Taiwan ever declares independence.
China,3cjasc,xuankun,6,Wed Jul 8 15:53:00 2015 UTC,Well Taiwan's constitution claims the mainland too.
China,3cjasc,zakazaw,-1,Thu Jul 9 04:17:44 2015 UTC,"It's only a relic left over from the ROC constitution and Taiwan does not actively enforce that claim. Unlike China which passed an anti-secessionist law last decade that threatened force if Taiwan ""broke away"" and which also included Taiwan in its national security law last week."
China,3cjasc,xuankun,2,Thu Jul 9 04:41:19 2015 UTC,It doesn't enforce the claim because it doesn't have the military might to do so. If the situations were reversed they would claim it just as fervently.
China,3cjasc,zakazaw,-2,Thu Jul 9 04:46:35 2015 UTC,"Assuming the situations were reversed but Taiwan/ROC was a democracy, I don't think so. A democratic country cannot just claim another country that has been separate for over 60 years and threaten military force to retake it."

China,3ck3ks,kanev91,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:08:55 2015 UTC,"China’s securities regulator banned major shareholders, corporate executives and directors from selling stakes in listed companies for six months, its latest effort to stop the nation’s $3.5 trillion stock-market rout.  Investors with stakes exceeding 5 percent must maintain their positions, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said in a statement. The rule is intended to guard capital-market stability amid an “unreasonable plunge” in share prices, the CSRC said.  While China has already ordered government-owned institutions to maintain or boost their stock holdings, the CSRC’s directive expands the ban on sales to non-state companies and potentially foreign investors who own major stakes in mainland businesses. Regulators have unveiled market-boosting measures almost every night over the past 10 days, steps that have so far failed to revive investor confidence. Foreign traders sold Chinese shares at a record pace this week in part due concerns over the government’s meddling in markets.  “This is not something that would happen in the U.S. or in any other developed market,” said Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee $250 billion as the chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. “It does smell a little bit of desperation. But in China it’s a very unique system and they are taking unique steps to try to stop the drop.”  IPO Halt  The Shanghai Composite Index slid 5.9 percent on Wednesday as official attempts to stop the selling, including measures to prop up small-cap stocks, were overshadowed by data showing an unprecedented liquidation of margin trades on Tuesday.  Chinese authorities have also suspended initial public offerings, restricted bearish bets via stock-index futures and encouraged financial firms to buy shares. In perhaps the most dramatic effort to prevent investors from selling, local exchanges have allowed at least 1,331 companies to halt trading in their shares.  As the Shanghai Composite’s record-breaking boom goes bust, President Xi Jinping’s government is intervening in an attempt to prevent falling stock prices from eroding confidence in his leadership. The moves have cast doubt on the ruling Communist Party’s pledge less than two years ago to give market forces a bigger role in the economy, part of its largest reform drive since the 1990s.  Intervention Risk  China isn’t the only market with a history of state intervention. During the Asian financial crisis in 1998, Hong Kong’s government bought shares worth $15 billion to prop up the market. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily banned short selling on some shares during the global financial crisis in 2008.  “It may have a small impact in short term, but like all market manipulation, there will be a price to be paid later,” Gregory Lesko, a money manager at Deltec Asset Management LLC in New York, said by e-mail. “I recall a slew of short selling bans during the financial crisis. Nothing saved the day.”  Under current mainland rules, a single foreign investor can own as much as 10 percent of a company’s issued shares, according to the Hong Kong stock exchange’s website. International funds have gained unprecedented access to the Shanghai market through an exchange link with Hong Kong that began in November, and authorities have said they’re planning a similar link with China’s smaller bourse in Shenzhen this year.  Selling Pressure  MSCI Inc., whose indexes are used to benchmark an estimated $9.5 trillion of assets, cited China’s capital controls as a reason why mainland shares were left out of its global equity gauges in June.  Foreign investors have sold a net 33.4 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) of Shanghai shares through the city’s exchange link in the past three days. China has allocated investment quotas of about $138 billion through its so-called QFII and RQFII programs for foreign money managers, which include BlackRock Inc. and HSBC Global Asset Management.  “The extent to which they can apply this to foreign ownership interest remains to be seen,” Jacobsen said. “But to me they are grasping the straws to find a way to stop the selling pressure.”"

I'm wondering if the CPC's plan is to freeze the stocks, then either give money to companies to perform buy backs or give the mutual funds money so that they'll continue to not sell.  Either way though this is going to result in lots of bad debt being taken on by the banks to sit right alongside the provincial debt that China just refinanced.

China,3chxfl,Cai_E,17,Wed Jul 8 01:33:50 2015 UTC,crazy shit is being done off the market   Apparently a lot of companies were taking out loans against their share price.  Rather than selling shares or issuing new shares (which might have lowered the value) they took out loans with their share price as collateral thus keeping the value inflated.  If trading in their stock is halted and the prices remain frozen then their collateral still stands.  This is one of the reasons why so many companies want their shares frozen.  It's similar to what happens with property values where investors don't need to sell or rent out an apartment because they can just borrow against it and realize the profit.  So long as they don't sell the apartment they can keep it as an asset with an inflated price

Before the interest raise, you can maybe issue some chinese bonds at 4.5% interest rate and say ""hey! better than bank of america that is at 4%!""  But then the interest rate gets jacked up, bank of america is offering 4.5% interest rate for their new bonds.  You are a chinese company and you reeeeally need that money, so you say ""hey! Come here 5% interest rate!""  But bonds are debts.  It's gonna show up on your assets sheet.  You're not making more money, but you're spending more money.  Your profit gets smaller, shareholders look at that and say ""well, this stock is not doing as good as I expected.  Let's sell it before it tanks!""  And things will burn."

The CPC fought, but really only when Japanese operations came near one of their strongholds or such.  The big thing was that the KMT strategy of retreating inland to put stress on Japanese logistics, give them fewer airfields to operate from, and no naval support was a solid one but doesn't exactly win you points with the coastal population who gets left behind."
China,3chcyj,Cai_E,5,Tue Jul 7 22:45:21 2015 UTC,I have a hard time believing the strategy was to strain logistics. I think that was simply a result of getting their asses beat and running away.
China,3chcyj,nikatnight,18,Wed Jul 8 00:13:08 2015 UTC,"Well yeah if you can win the battle then you don't need to retreat, but the loser needs a plan as well.  Making your enemy outrun his supply lines is a classic move.  What China lacked was the mobility to then counter attack, form a salient, and achieve a significant victory.    Actually initial battles when the KMT's German trained National Revolutionary Army did extremely well.  The 88th actually almost succeed in pushing the the Japanese Marines back in to the sea at Shanghai, but ultimately had to fall due to a lack of air support and the fact there was no relief force for it (since most of the other units present were of the shit militia variety).    NRA divisions around Beijing held the mountain passes and subjected the Japanese to heavy causalities before eventually being broken by the Japanese Air Force and the fact the Japanese had well trained reserves.  Asses kicked definitely isn't true considering the amount of damage those under strength NRA divisions did to better equipped Japanese forces.  German advisers, who were recalled by Hilter, left behind detailed plans about falling back inland.  American and Soviet advisers also made the same suggestion.  There are numerous operational differences that show the movements were deliberate after initial failures to hold Beijing, Shanghai, and Nanjing.  The KMT initially tried to hold because they recognized the amount of political legitimacy they ceded by not holding key cities such as Nanjing.  The KMT deliberately avoided conflict except at further inland areas like Changsha or when they felt holding was worthwhile because it allowed them to blunt Japanese offensives (the KMT would often hold out early in 'fighting season' so that Japan would have its window to conduct offensives in shortened).  At Changsha for example they defeated the IJA multiple times ('39, '41 and '42).  Eventually Japan put together a million man army, took Changsha in 1944, and got jack shit in return.  The KMT bled them so badly at Changsha that the IJA couldn't advance any further inland.  They were initially repelled at Hengyang, the next city down, eventually regrouped and took Hengyang in August 1944 but were left with so few troops they couldn't control the area effectively."
China,3chcyj,Cai_E,11,Wed Jul 8 00:36:19 2015 UTC,"Also the decision to fight to the end at Shanghai was Chiang miscalculating league of nations and foreign countries' willingness to interfere. He had thought that if he showed the world that China had serious capability to resist, they'd be more willing to interfere or at least mediate. But lo and behold the foreign powers had their own problems to worry about."
China,3chcyj,JillyPolla,3,Wed Jul 8 00:47:04 2015 UTC,Depends. I think the successive battles of Changsha was a deliberate strategy to lure the Japanese into certain areas where their logistics cannot support them and thus they would be surrounded.

The Nationalist party only helped by keeping Japanese troops occupied on the mainland and stretching their forces and logistics thin. The US employed the island hopping strategy and got close enough to start bombing Tokyo.  The Nationalist party was predicting to be close enough to bomb Tokyo in 1946 (even with US assistance, the push towards the east to get in range wasn't going well).  It is hard to say that either party ""defeated"" Japan, but is more accurate to say they endured Japanese occupation.

China,3chcyj,wansuiwansui,20,Tue Jul 7 23:38:08 2015 UTC,"Problem was the KMT's largest supporters were land owners.  Lots of his officers, party bureaucrats, etc were second and third sons who needed a career given the eldest was getting the land.  Land reform was a huge issue at the time, with most of the disenchanted serfs being drawn to Mao's populist rhetoric on redistribution.  The US mission to Chengdu actually told Chiang multiple times he needed to do something about it, but he repeatedly refused claiming if he pushed any reforms most of the officers and party officials would quit in protest or just depose him and stick a guy in who would repudiate his reforms.  Plus Chiang was a traditionalist and had no real desire to make waves with reforms.  I'd also note that Taiwan was really poorly run by the KMT initially.  America poured a lot of money into the KMT to keep them afloat in Taiwan and had to push them to conduct reforms on Taiwan.  Mao was really the CPC 2.0.  You had the 1927 expulsion of the CPC from the KMT unity government, the failed uprising, lots of senior folks (who thought Mao sucked) were killed in that creating openings for Mao's advancement since his rural apparatus rose as the old guard's urban apparatus was destroyed by the KMT, Mao pulled the Long March off to go hide in the mountains, etc.  Had Chiang beaten Mao, Chiang likely would have found himself facing CPC 3.0 bankrolled by the Soviets sooner rather than later since there was just such a huge disenfranchised lower class there waiting to be radicalized."
China,3chcyj,Cai_E,13,Wed Jul 8 00:46:20 2015 UTC,"I don't see how you can say that Chiang had no interest in land reforms. His land reforms in Taiwan was basically what he wanted to do in China. But as you suggested he had to deal with entrenched interests so he couldn't successfully implement the land reform. If you read contemporary materials at that time he knew he needed to deal with land reform and he also wanted to do it, but given the various problems he wasn't able to carry them out in scale.  The KMT would force both the land owners and the farmers to compromise with each other. This made two unhappy parties. The Communist would help the farmers to kill or expel the landowners, and then tell them that you should fight for us, because if the KMT comes back you'd be dead when they bring the law back. This led to one party out of the question and another very supportive of you."
China,3chcyj,JillyPolla,17,Wed Jul 8 00:54:23 2015 UTC,"One difference though is when Chiang lands in Taiwan, his power base is made up primarily of troops brought in from the mainland, so he had lots of guys with lots of guns who now suddenly liked the idea of land redistribution or at least have no loyalty to those whose land is being broken up.  Especially those who grasped they would not be crossing back to liberate mainland China and thus realized they needed to get settled in.  Whereas had he won in mainland China, he has issue of how he's going to sell his own party's power structure on land reform.  I think the odds are that the Soviets would basically be faster at rabble rousing than Chiang could have been at land reform.  The Soviets just need to piss people off and get some guns in their hands, Chiang needs to get entrenched powers on board with a land reform process and implement it.  Basically I don't think he could scale his solution fast enough and that he didn't have the force of will necessary just to shove it down people's throats.  Sun Yat-Sen had a real talent at consensus building and a general charisma.  Mao had a talent for putting bullets in the skulls of people who gave him problems.  In my eyes Chiang lacked the charisma or the ruthless personality to get it done fast enough."
China,3chcyj,Cai_E,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:04:08 2015 UTC,super easy to be pro-land reform...when it's not your land. says every dispossessed Taiwanese former land owner...
China,3chcyj,justinchina,7,Wed Jul 8 03:00:12 2015 UTC,"I suggest you reading up a bit on the actual reform process itself.   The land owners were not just shit out of luck like they were in China. They were compensated with shares in SOE and other companies. The only thing they lost was their power as landlords over serfs.   Many big landlords would go on to become wealthy businessmen for their shares of Taiwanese companies, which as you know later on became very valuable."
China,3chcyj,JillyPolla,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:46:47 2015 UTC,and...and...they offered up the land?  willingly?  They were consulted about the process and did it via democratic means?
China,3chcyj,justinchina,7,Wed Jul 8 04:49:30 2015 UTC,"I suggest you read these three articles, which were the three land reform policies that KMT undertook in Taiwan:  三七五減租: This limited the rent on a land to 37.5% of the production  公地放領: This sold farmlands seized from Japanese to those without land at 2.5 times the annual production, to be paid over 10 years.  耕者有其田: This limited the total amount of land that a landowner can own. The land that are over the limit were to be sold to the government at 2.5 times the annual production, payable over 10 years. 70% were paid with government bonds with 4% coupon, and the 30% were paid with shares in big SOE's.  So no, they were not all being done willingly, but it was not like the landowners were not justly compensated. As I stated before, the shares ended up being worth much much more than the land would have been worth. So compared to other land reforms in other countries this is actually quite mild."
China,3chcyj,JillyPolla,0,Wed Jul 8 05:15:10 2015 UTC,"well, I guess after 228 Taiwanese landowners were probably just grateful not to disappear (the KMT lets us talk about the 228 incident now, right?). that being said, my original statement stands...CKS would never do it to his own people...only to those whom he didn't care about...and to those whom he could force.  maybe it helped Taiwan in general, and obviously it was done with the US governments blessing and help...and maybe some of the victims did ok financially (eventually), but all you are quibbling about, is the price. not whether it was equally good for seller, and buyer. not whether it was fair/just. it may have been ""MORE fair"" than what the CCP did...but just barely."
China,3chcyj,justinchina,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:36:52 2015 UTC,"Do you have any recommended reading material that retells KMT/nationalist history from KMT's perspective?

After going to taiwan I am extremely interested in KMT's narrative, but I just don't know where to start."
China,3chcyj,timming,3,Wed Jul 8 19:47:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know how good your Chinese is, but I can recommend Jay Taylor's book on Chiang Kai-Shek. It's well researched and takes into consideration on materials that were released in the recent years. While I wouldn't say it's a KMT narrative, the book is quite sympathetic to him. It encompass the historic periods of the early days of Republic to the time when he was in Taiwan.   Another accessible book that I can recommend is Rana Mitter's Forgotten Ally. Again, not really a KMT narrative book though."

China,3chcyj,derintellectual,6,Wed Jul 8 00:10:40 2015 UTC,KMT actually had decent cooperation with the Turkic Muslims and was used to letting regions operate with extensive autonomy since half the warlords only paid lip service to the KMT as it was.
China,3chcyj,Cai_E,4,Wed Jul 8 00:47:13 2015 UTC,Didn't the Ma Clique not put down numerous rebellions in Xinjiang? I thought it was with the Hui they had decent cooperation with?
China,3chcyj,derintellectual,4,Wed Jul 8 01:09:00 2015 UTC,"The Uyghurs split.  Many threw in with the Soviets, but other warlords (Yulbars Khan being the biggest name), threw in with the KMT.  Yulbars actually ended up in Taiwan where he got to be governor in exile.  So there was potential there in terms of putting a Uyghur warlord in charge of the province and giving him an autonomy type deal.    Hui were definitely the best though in terms of working with the KMT."
China,3chcyj,Cai_E,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:20:46 2015 UTC,"China was not politically united till the civil war had 1 winner. There is practically 0 chance of KMT allowing Tibet to be any different than it is today if they had won.    Autonomy is a word, how its used it different. Tibet is autonomous on paper even now but different in practice. Same would have been the case under KMT."
China,3chcyj,iVarun,8,Wed Jul 8 03:25:08 2015 UTC,"Tibet during 1911-1950 was basically de facto independent. All they had to do was acknowledge ultimate Chinese authority, but they could do whatever they wanted. The only time when Chinese force fought Tibetan ones was when they crossed over the Yangtze river to attack Han areas. Rest of the time they were essentially left alone, other than the ROC representatives that were at Lhasa.   To be fair to the CCP, the full crackdown of Tibet didn't really start until Dalai Lama's rebellion. Before that they essentially continued the KMT policy of largely hands off, but acknowledge that we ultimately had authority over you."
China,3chcyj,JillyPolla,6,Wed Jul 8 05:02:58 2015 UTC,"I know Tibet was de facto independent(but not de jure, like Mongolia who was deliberately forced out of the Chinese hands by the Soviets) and it wasn't alone in that. Many parts of China were. That is what being in a civil war implies. The Central Polity was not strong enough to demand OR Offer anything to such regions. And by the time Civil War was over Tibet and its leadership like many times in centuries past felt it was time to exert exclusive sovereignty. They were not prepared for re-establishment of Chinese Suzerainty as they were till 1911.    And lastly the reason why both sides would have faced a war/confrontation was mostly because this was not a world where Civilization States could exists in Legal terms. It was a post-Westphalian world for the Chinese and Tibetans.    It was irrelevant who had won the Civil War. Tibet would have clashed and it would have gotten annexed the same way, under the KMT.    Plus had they not done so India would have strategically made their position worse as well. KMT and CCP are parties, but they are(or rather were and KMT certainly would in case it had won be) part of the larger Chinese strategic outlook vis-a-vis the outsiders.   Hence the situation would have been the same because it was unavoidable."
China,3chcyj,iVarun,-2,Wed Jul 8 05:24:12 2015 UTC,"It was irrelevant who had won the Civil War. Tibet would have clashed and it would have gotten annexed the same way, under the KMT.   I'm wondering where you get this information? Do you have a crystal ball that tells you what the world ""would have looked like"" if history had gone a drastically different way. The KMT had a different ideology, history, personnel, support base, and incentives than the CCP. To say that they would have been ""exactly the same"" is a pretty bold (and facile) claim."
China,3chcyj,Kooglemoore,5,Wed Jul 8 10:28:00 2015 UTC,"Its common sense, i also have lots of contact with Tibetan Refuges and I have read up and analyzed this region of theater quite a lot. I Understand this subject matter quite well.   KMT's ideology was not antithetical with the Chinese populace and the Chinese nation at large. Had it won it would have swallowed up people who supported other lines(like the people who went on to support, join or be part of the CCP). KMT would have been the guardians/representatives of the Chinese Civilization State in a modern Nation State World.   And this fact doesn't need extrapolating or a magic ball. KMT even in Taiwan was a Chinese-Nationalistic dictatorship and on a smaller scale quite brutal at times depending upon the section who was under its radar.    I already explained the strategic angle.   RoC (i.e. KMT) claims Tibet in its constitution, it was true back when the winner would have been arrived at. This would have meant KMT would have inherited the dispute border that Tibet had with newly Independent India.    There is no freaking way in hell, KMT would have conceded Tibetan territory according to the wishes of the India and basically allowed the new Buffer state of Tibet to get bulldozed by Indian influence, which was a Diplomatic juggernaut of that era among the non-European countries, despite RoC being the UNSC member, in fact China(RoC) was the first country to sign the UN Charter ahead of the other 4 Permanent countries.  Don't be surprised to hear some Chinese claim(possibly jokingly) they made the UN since they were the 1st member.     KMT was and would not have been incompetent. They would have seen the strategic value of Tibet not only with India and South East Asia(which was still in a mess at that time) but also with the natural resources Tibet had. Plus the Legal claim they would have had over Tibet. Tibet was Chinese, that is a fact. Civil War doesn't mean anyone can declare Independence for perpetuity without a Ratified Agreement. This isn't 2015 UK giving Scotland the Referendum vote. This is middle of 20th century just post WW2. And KMT was in power (weakly but in power) at the Center in China, they had enough time to Ratify the Tibetan Independence, they never did, in contrast to Mongolia who they were forced to concede even though Civil War was not over by then. And PRC was also unable to overcome Soviet Pressure.    And KMT had the support of the US back then and India was not in any camp, US never liked India for this reason. There would have been little resistance from US had KMT retaken its former territories, they might even have supported them on Mongolia which achieved Independence because they sided with the Soviets.    Then there is the Tibetans themselves. They had by this time been de facto Independent for almost 35 years, basically 2 generations in that era. And knowing a lot of Tibetans, they are stubborn as hell. They would never have conceded the terms of a Modern Nation State. As i said, in a post-Westphalian World the Legality of a Civilization State doesn't hold, its a non starter. Practical Autonomy would have been harder to agree/negotiate and even if it had it would have failed once KMT would have started on its development program. They would have encountered massive resistance, political and cultural.    The idea that KMT and CCP are these monolithic entities separate from the broader Groups they come from is utter delusion. They are not Isolates.    They don't exist in a vacuum, they are Chinese themselves and irrespective of ideology the notion of Chinese Territorial Integrity is paramount to both KMT/RoC and CCP/PRC.    This is even borne out by RoC current claims to Land Borders which had been settled by PRC, even if one is to argue that RoC does that because it has no choice because PRC has threatened it with War, its not a convincing argument. Because, Firstly, PRC has said that about declaring Independence, Not relinquishing old Border claims which are redundant since PRC itself has Ratified them, i.e. RoC can say they give up its claim on Mongolia and Russian Territory and it would be a non-issue and not a casus belli for PRC to invade, Because PRC itself has Ratified those 2 Borders, plus 10 more. Second, RoC can relinquish its claim in the South China Sea and East China Sea but it hasn't.     I could go on with other smaller points further still. But all this in combination leads to the same conclusion i listed before.    i.e. it was irrelevant who would have won the Civil War, Tibet was a renegade territory in a Sovereign Nation State world, it had no chance of staying Independent.    The only thing that could be argued is KMT might not have been as harsh as CCP once Tibet was annexed but even that I don't agree because when you get the Tibetans having a violent uprising the blow-back and crackdown is inevitable and that creates a multi-generational hatred and conflict tense situation.    Plus the KMT's behavior in Taiwan corroborates my point even further.    Ideologies has nothing to do with this. India had Socialist, Liberal, Democratic values from the get go, YET it annexed multiple smaller territories and coerced one into the Republic. And they were the right decision, ask any 1.2 Billion Indians today or then. And this was done when India was actually good, peaceful and virtuous. Quite the contrast to what KMT was in its engagement with its own populace when they didn't agree."
China,3chcyj,iVarun,7,Wed Jul 8 12:50:42 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget that Tibetan refugees and government in exile are the former aristocratic and theocratic class, so they don't represent the majority view in Tibet."
China,3chcyj,JillyPolla,2,Wed Jul 8 15:58:14 2015 UTC,"so they don't represent the majority view in Tibet.   This narrative will not go down well in most of the world public discourse.    If the objective of the DL and Tibetan Exiles was to make this a PR issue whereby their position is looked at favorably and the Chinese negatively. It has been a resounding success. A case study in how to run a non-violent separatist refugee movement.    But if the objective was to get on ground aims, they have failed miserably. Its case study in how to lose your culture, traditions and home and heritage. They utterly suck balls at Real-politik. And spending 10 minutes with a Tibetan Refuges makes this apparent why, because they hold their position to be Non-negotiable, which is a logical dead end for any dispute.    For decades the per-capita income level of the Tibetan Refugees was many many orders more than Tibetans in China. This trend in in a reversal and soon Tibetans in China will be many orders richer. This is going change the dynamic. I can expect some really nasty International PR disasters for both sides.  I predict there will be 2 groups/individuals of Tibetans debating on a foreign channel or think-tank very soon, bringing each other down with the usual cliche accusations.    Its going to be hilarious, the Exiled Tibetans will probably win the initial debate/PR encounters but in the end its going to hurt the Exiled Tibetans more, i feel.    Imagine a Tibetan athlete at the Olympics. The number of script possibilities is enough to make a couple of seasons for a show."
China,3chcyj,iVarun,0,Wed Jul 8 16:35:41 2015 UTC,"I misunderstood your previous post. Your main argument--there is no reason to think the KMT would have agreed to an independent Tibet--makes sense broadly speaking. The finer point of how much autonomy Tibet would retain is unknowable and I think you're overstating the case a bit there. Don't forget that under the KMT even Sichuan, Guangdong, and Shanxi enjoyed broad levels of autonomy and it's plausible that a federal-like system might have emerged out of the quasi warlord situation of the Nanjing decade."
China,3chcyj,Kooglemoore,6,Wed Jul 8 13:00:04 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that under the KMT even Sichuan, Guangdong, and Shanxi enjoyed broad levels of autonomy and it's plausible that a federal-like system might have emerged out of the quasi warlord situation of the Nanjing decade.   This was before the Civil War ended.    And China doesn't like lose central polity, its just doesn't. This is not a Chinese are different thing, this factor has credible basis to it. A federal structure for such a large poor country at that stage would have just given rise to more insurgencies from other groups who had too much freedom. KMT was devastated and the economy was in the shitter, it was not a comfortable situation.   It was a time as i said, where China had no central polity of any authority. Neither the CCP nor the KMT was in any position to offer anyone anything or demand anything from anyone. I'd say this was not even limited to the regions which were their stronghold since that was all they had. Not a nice strategic position to be in, hence as the idiom goes, Bide your Time.    Secondly the treatment of minority/opposition sections in Taiwan by KMT corroborates the other details on how they would have treated Tibet. Tibet is bigger than Taiwan and its people are far more stubborn with a much more rich and prouder tradition and history. Tibet would have resisted any change and the change would have come since it came in Taiwan as well.    China in a new world would have needed a Unitary Identity, one which the Tibetans would have resisted.    Thirdly, the Chinese populace over time would have entered KMT and propped this conflict even more. KMT would not have done a reverse propaganda declaring Tibet as separate to make the populace less radical. They would have had a syllabus for children which would have re-enforced the old links. This I have seen and lived in my own country and it has nothing to do with Democracy or Dictatorship.    Other than the natural non-0 probability of events, i haven't in my years of understanding this subject matter come across a credible argument in which Tibet is Independent or Autonomous like some regions are currently in Spain are(and even they fought and fight like crazy till now and Spain is among the most liberal places on the planet).    Maybe a Soviet play like they did with Mongolia i can accept. Mongolia was the only one who recognized Tibetan Independence and vice versa till Soviets intervened for Mongolia. Tibet has close cultural links with Mongolia as everyone know. With a US friendly anti-communist in play Soviets would have helped Tibet and with India not having much problem since India was close to the Soviets from the get go despite not being in their camp, plus it would have allowed them to have a loose buffer they can manipulate since India has deep ties to Tibet as well.    This is plausible, i concede. But other other incidence and possibilities to me dominate too much in a corroboratory fashion."
China,3chcyj,iVarun,5,Wed Jul 8 14:04:38 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. During his rule his policy was largely hands off with Tibet and Hsinkiang. Basically, as long as you acknowledged KMT's central government and don't collaborate with enemy, you'll get your support from the central government."

The best critics were writers who allied with none - Lu Xun, Lao She.

Still, I completely agree that a trip to Xinjiang is worth it. Especially right now since the region's tourism is still recovering from all the bad press of 2014. Places aren't crowded and the weather this year is incredibly cool.  And...begin shameless plug here: if you go, at least check out the Xinjiang travel guide I published this year.

China,3chvhx,farwestchina,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:11:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the question. I'd say there are three primary differences:   Coverage - As much as I love Lonely Planet and all the other great travel guides, their Xinjiang chapters are quite short. It's the difference between 400+ pages (the FarWestChina guide) and 20+ pages (Lonely Planet). I cover more than just the typical tourist stuff. Updated - All of my content is updated as of April 2015 and will continue to be updated on an annual basis. It's the advantage that living here and publishing digitally has over using travel writers and publishing every two years (LP). Stuff really does change that fast. Maps - I invested a couple thousand dollars and consulted on the design of what I think are some pretty cool maps that are extremely helpful for travelers. Not just city maps, but area maps for Altay, Kashgar, Urumqi, and Turpan among others.   I cover over 100 more Xinjiang locations than LP does and I offer a more ""insider"" perspective based on my decade of living here...something that I think is hard for any travel writer, no matter how experienced, to replicate.  The book isn't that expensive ($9.99) but if you were to purchase it and not like it, I'd be more than happy to refund you the money."

China,3cii7n,SeriousStyle,3,Wed Jul 8 08:29:54 2015 UTC,"Here's the article for those who don't got a VPN.  Goldman Sachs Says There’s No China Stock Bubble, Sees Rally  By Cindy Wang China’s biggest stock-market rout since 1992 has done nothing to erode the bullish outlook of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Kinger Lau, the bank’s China strategist in Hong Kong, predicts the large-cap CSI 300 Index will rally 27 percent from Tuesday’s close over the next 12 months as government support measures boost investor confidence and monetary easing spurs economic growth. Leveraged positions aren’t big enough to trigger a market collapse, Lau says, and valuations have room to climb.  Goldman Sachs is sticking with its optimistic forecast in the face of record foreign outflows, the biggest-ever selloff by Chinese margin traders and a chorus of bubble warnings from international peers. The call hinges on the success of unprecedented government efforts to revive confidence among individual investors who watched equity values tumble by $3.2 trillion over the past three weeks. “It’s not in a bubble yet,” Lau said in an interview. “China’s government has a lot of tools to support the market.” The Shanghai Composite Index sank 5.9 percent to a three-month low at Wednesday’s close, as another round of government support measures failed to allay concern that margin trades will keep unwinding at a record pace.  Trading Halts Lau, who set his CSI 300 target on July 1, confirmed on Tuesday that the projection still stands. He’s been forecasting gains in Chinese shares for much of the past year, a stance that paid off as the CSI 300 surged to a seven-year high last month. The past few weeks, however, have been painful for bulls. The CSI 300 was down 27 percent from its peak as of Tuesday’s close, while the Shanghai Composite Index just completed its biggest three-week tumble in more than two decades. Margin traders reduced positions by more than 7 percent on Monday as the unwinding of leveraged bets extended for an unprecedented 11th day. Selling through the Shanghai-Hong Kong exchange link over the past two days swelled to a record, while strategists from BlackRock Inc. to Credit Suisse Group AG and Bank of America Corp. all warned of unsustainable valuations at the end of last month.  Even after the median price-to-earnings ratio in China dropped to 55 from 108 at the height of the rally in June, valuations are more than twice as high as those on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. State Support “The Shanghai market is still expensive,” Mark McFarland, the chief global economist at Coutts & Co. in Hong Kong, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. Policy measures to support prices are “unlikely to be successful in the short term. Ultimately it’s people’s minds that you have to get into, to get confidence up. That’s a difficult task.”  Lau says the government has enough firepower. Policy makers have already suspended initial public offerings, relaxed margin trading rules, cut transaction fees and directed state-run institutions to maintain or boost equity holdings. A group of 21 brokerages pooled at least 120 billion yuan ($19.3 billion) for a market support fund. The central bank will probably keep easing monetary policy, Lau says, after four interest-rate cuts since November and reductions to banks’ reserve requirements. The outlook for China’s economic growth has improved for three straight months, according to the China Bloomberg Monthly GDP Estimate index.  While Lau concedes there are pockets of over-valuation in China, particularly in small-cap stocks, he’s less concerned about the broader market. The CSI 300, which has a heavy weighting in low-priced financial stocks, trades at 17 times earnings, versus more than 40 times in 2007. “Re-rating is not over for China’s stock market,” Lau said. “We are still positive.”"
China,3cii7n,Cai_E,4,Wed Jul 8 08:34:01 2015 UTC,"Klinger Lau would also kindly like the CPC to return his children and his dog at their earliest convenience.    Over the next 12 months, I would not necessarily disagree in that the standard pattern should be the market corrects now and often the market will over correct and drop too far.  So then it climbs back up.  This is especially true in that the Chinese market tends to have larger swings, Shenzen always seems to randomly have them because the traders got bored, drank too much baijiu over lunch, or who the hell knows really.  So I can see over corrected downward and then rallying back up.     Over correct downwards now, China manufacturing ends up reporting good numbers for Q4 and you'd see a nice climb into the 4000s.  Problem is though the CPC is fucking with this process by trying to support it currently and this historically has exacerbated the problem."
China,3cii7n,Cai_E,3,Wed Jul 8 04:34:50 2015 UTC,"Kinger Lau sounds like an amazingly smart man.   The market might go up but this guy sounds like he's way too high on the government and China. Look at some of the crap he dishes out: monetary easing will spur economic growth, the government has lots of tools (which it has already been using), valuations have room to grow?

China,3ci1ol,silkwolf,15,Wed Jul 8 01:54:17 2015 UTC,"Copy from askhistorians  Britain got Hong Kong as a result of the first Opium War, the Kowloon Penuinsala as a result of the second. But the New Territories came later, during peace time, as a result of pressuring the Qing dynasty for new territory (due to British anxiety about growing French influence in southern China).   Perhaps asking for a permanent cessation of such a large peace of territory at no provocation was a bit too much. Certainly, the frame in of the negotiations was very different than the surrender terms in which the other ones took place. But the term of 99 years was chosen simply because Claude MacDonald, the British representative, thought it was ""as good as forever."" With crumbling Qing dynasty, there might not be a ""China"" to return Hong Kong in 99 years.   In a alternate timeline, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Tibet could have declared independence. The rest of core China could have been split into a dozen or more factions, divided between local opportunistic warlords, nationalist, communist, Qing imperial loyalist, self-declared Emperors and Japanese puppets."

China,3ci1ol,redodge,3,Wed Jul 8 02:09:02 2015 UTC,"I recall reading that all the critical infrastructure (water/electricity/etc) was located in the New Territories, so when the lease expired, it didn't matter if you owned HK island, because you didn't own any of the infrastructure necessary for it to run. Not sure if that's true or not.  That being said, by the end of the 20th century Britain was out of the imperialist game. I'm sure they would have returned it even if there was no lease over NT.  As to why the NT were leased in the first place, I have no idea."
China,3ci1ol,hydr0xide,7,Wed Jul 8 02:39:07 2015 UTC,"The BBC do a program every year when they go through what files have been declassified that year and discuss what we have learned. It was either last year or the year before that the files from when the Thatcher government started to think about the lease running out in the early 80s. It looks at if they wanted to see if holding onto it would be possible, but there was no way that China would allow it.  They actually did an assessment of whether the military would be able to defend Hong Kong if they decided to hold onto it without reaching a political agreement. Basically they realized it would be totally impossible. I believe Deng Xiaoping later said during initial negotiations, when the British government was still trying to see if they could reach a political way to hold onto HK, that taking HK back would be 'an afternoon's work for the PLA'.  This at least shows that they did consider holding onto it."
China,3ci1ol,redodge,2,Wed Jul 8 04:50:41 2015 UTC,"I remember reading that too, but I'm sure it would have been more about ""protecting Hong Kong"" rather than ""protecting the Empire"" - i.e. would Britain be able to give Hong Kong independence (and defend it militarily) rather than handing it back to the PRC?  I could be wrong, but I'm not sure there was any real desire to hold on to HK as part of the British Empire."
China,3ci1ol,justinchina,3,Wed Jul 8 05:16:14 2015 UTC,"I think HK, as opposed to most of Britain's other colonies in the late 20th century, was still pretty profitable at the time as a financial centre and there was not a politically-challenging domestic push towards independence. So I think if the UK could have held onto it without spending tons of economic and political capital on it, they would have. Obviously China would not allow that to be the case."

Chinese: Yay, progress!  Laowai: What about the people in those houses?  Chinese: Oh, they were moved away.  Laowai: That's sad, what'll happen to them?  Chinese: It's OK, look at the shiny road instead.

China,3cjt8n,relevantdetails,3,Wed Jul 8 13:45:06 2015 UTC,"the basic argument is that, since chinese firms are highly indebted and growth is faltering, there might be a corporate debt crisis coming. if they could somehow raise capital other than through raising profits or borrowing more in order to pay down this debt, the crisis can be averted.   here is where the stock market comes in... if they can raise cash by selling stock in a bull market, that would do it. stock doesn't have to be paid back. once companies have exchanged stock for cash, the stock can crash and fuck over investors, but the company will be healthy again since they have paid down their debt. the accusation of ""stealing"" arises from the fact that the bull market has been driven by government policy, and only mad guanxi insiders have insight into what the govt plans to do so they can profit by timing the market effectively."
China,3cjt8n,MOOC0WMOO,2,Wed Jul 8 14:49:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think this, but I do think that Chinese markets are shady as hell and the end result is that ""the people"" (i.e. outsiders) lose out.  Why?  Because I don't trust a word in any of these companies' financial statements. On paper some of them look decent, but you have no way of knowing whether those numbers are true.  I NEVER came across a Chinese company that wasn't cooking its books somehow, and after dealing directly with major firms in China, I have zero confidence in independent audits.  Ultimately this means that ""insiders"" (founders, high-level executives and other connected parties) can pump and dump their shares, cash out and leave Bofu and Bomu holding the bag.  However, noone's forcing Bofu and Bomu to buy the shares in the first place, so I can't call it ""stealing"".

China,3cjt8n,hydr0xide,2,Wed Jul 8 14:43:17 2015 UTC,"I am highly cynical about Chinese society, but I would be surprised if this were the case.  Chinese elites have much better tools at their disposal when it comes to redistributing wealth upwards into their own pockets than the stock market.  I seriously doubt they have need of something volatile and inherently uncontrollable like a stock market in order to get themselves richer.  They are already astronomically wealthy compared to China's median, and were when the Chinese stock market as we know it today started to come into being.  On the contrary, they are much more interested in maintaining the status quo than in figuring out how to rip peasants off even more.  I would say that the stock market exists much more to function as a sort of slightly more sophisticated lottery than as a concerted attempt at upward wealth distribution.  It exists to give hope to the peasants and the middle class and use that hope to maintain stability.  That would be the most cynical possible interpretation of the stock market that I would personally care to entertain.  Of course, less cynical explanations are equally if not more plausible (nor are they, in any case, mutually exclusive); stock markets are also very efficient means of channeling capital and liquidity to businesses that can best use them to more rapidly expand than otherwise possible.  The Chinese stock market on the whole has probably been an important part of helping China enter into and compete on the world economic stage.  I don't see how any country, developed or not, could compete internationally without a stock market to help more efficiently corral its resources."

China,3ch89r,nikkinikkinicole,4,Tue Jul 7 22:00:39 2015 UTC,"You also need to be very careful about reviews. Pay most attention to the middle-tier reviews instead of positive ones, as there is an online culture for giving 5 star ratings for just receiving an item satisfactorily.   Read the reviews and you'll see plenty of ""not tried it yet"", ""just received the item"" and ""item was poor quality, but seller accepted the return so here's 5 stars"" positive reviews. Sellers can get very pissy about average or negative reviews because they consider it a ""public"" loss of face.  If you're buying something common that's easy to check for fakes, then you should be fine with a highly-rated seller. However think logically: if the item you're buying is something not normally available in China, e.g. an imported mobile phone, the buyers are going to be far less adept at spotting dodgy goods.   Case in point: I bought the latest model PS3 from who I could see was the most trusted seller on Taobao (full price). They had thousands of positive reviews, plenty with photos, and a small handful of average reviews. I ordered a brand new American PS3. I got a refurbished Japanese PS3 in Mexico packaging with a fake controller. The icing on the cake was that they'd removed the console serial numbers and stuck fake ones on to match the Mexico packaging.  It was probably one of the shittiest fake-jobs I'd ever seen, but would a Chinese buyer know? Unlikely, as you'd need to have seen a Japanese PS3 before, have DVDs on hand to test the region protection, and know how long a controller takes to register with the system to differentiate between dodgy and genuine. But few Chinese would know this so their reviews are naturally all ""GREAT SELLER YO!"" and then some."
China,3ch89r,mrminutehand,2,Wed Jul 8 00:51:07 2015 UTC,"you are 100% right, i used to read taobao reviews for the reading practice and it's very frequently ""I haven't tried it yet but great!"""

China,3ch89r,mrminutehand,2,Thu Jul 9 03:33:28 2015 UTC,"that's why you ignore best and medium reviews and head directly to bad ratings, the truth lies there, it's nice to find people complaining there about slow delivery and some minor details which should not actually receive bad rating but some Chinese just like to bitch, but for sure it's more useful than those guys praising anything even fake or faulty products especially on Taobao/TMall be aware that significant portion of sales/reviews are fake/bought, it's no problem to buy thousands of fake customers, so if you think that 10 biggest seller must be still quite good it can just mean that already since 5th place in results those guys sell basically nothing compared to the first and most of the sales are fake, easy way how to find fake sales it's huge disproportion between reviews and photos, creating tons of genuine photos seem to be much more difficult than copypasting random text to reviews, so be very careful with reviews with small amount of photos"

Fast delivery, you can choose the time of delivery, track your delivery driver location, and products are always correct, I've never received a fake.  Make sure to press the 京东配送 button when searching. They also have hundreds of independent sellers, but they have their own customer service and use other delivery services, so more difficult to deal with.  I buy everything off JD that is too bulky or heavy to buy in a supermarket, rice, oil, bottled water/drinks, and also buy many other dry food goods or cooking products.  Amazon China is also good, but their website for me doesn't work in Chrome and freezes up, I always need to switch to IE to use Amazon.  Tmall and Taobao are good, but you definitely need to have at least 1 year or more of Chinese study before using these services.  Dealing with customer service, and many different delivery companies is a bit more difficult, and also there are often many fakes on Taobao.  I recommend Tmall and Taobao only if you have a Chinese friend living with you to help navigate and read reviews."

These are not separate.  There is no hard stats to back up the narrative some were deliberately targeted at the expense of others.    Same stat-less narrative can be used to suggest that many a corrupt Foreign firms were let off since it was at a time when practically no one would have gotten proper business without resorting to such measures.    Hence, in that reality linked chart does a decent enough job of highlighting that the crackdown was not Anti-Foreign exclusively."

Here's the origin of the infographic you shared:  China’s anti monopoly crackdown – Graphic of the day:  http://blog.thomsonreuters.com/index.php/chinas-anti-monopoly-crackdown-graphic-day/  It specifically shows fines imposed by the NDRC (on bottom) vs. anti-monopoly fines (on top). As you can see, the fines on bottom are nowhere near the size of the fines on top, which Qualcomm's $975 million fine blows all the other fines on bottom - $60 million being the largest - out of the water.  Furthermore, this infographic you've shared doesn't have the GSK fine in it at all, which was a staggering $500 million, and no Chinese pharmaceutical company was charged anywhere near this amount, if at all. In fact, until the Qualcomm case this year, GSK's fine was the biggest in China's history. You need to check your facts.  http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/business/international/gsk-china-fines.html?_r=0  http://www.bbc.com/news/business-29274822  http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/26/china-pharmaceuticals-margins-pix-graphi-idUSL3N0OC1A220140526  http://www.cheatsheet.com/business/chinas-corruption-crackdown-hits-big-pharma.html/?a=viewall   Chinese officials have recently visited Novartis AG, AstraZeneca Group Plc, Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly & Co., and Bayer AG all as part of a series of investigations into the pharmaceutical industry in China.

And i know the origin of the infographic and its content. And i clarified its context. That while its depicting anti-monopoly, its still part of the the overall corruption campaign under which this debate and allegation of targeting the foreign companies was made.

Instead, the Philippines merely wants the Tribunal, which interprets UNCLOS, to invalidate China’s nine-dash line claim over the South China Sea.  Territorial claims are the jurisdiction of another body, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and the ICJ only entertains cases if all parties in the dispute participate. China has refused to do so.  But although the Philippines is not arguing about who owns what in the South China Sea, its arguments have been misconstrued as such. Jardeleza, in fact, said, “For example, we’re not asking the court to say who owns Panatag shoal. We are arguing that they are within our EEZ and therefore under the rules of UNCLOS we have exclusive rights to fish within that area.”   Which is a self-contradictory argument, if Philippines admits that the UNCLOS tribunal has no jurisdiction over territorial claims, then UNCLOS tribunal cannot use UNCLOS to declare China's claim invalid."

The past 3 years have taught me China never wanted to progress in the relationship with the world, and honestly I doubt they want us at all further than what they can suck out of us knowledgewise. The government attitudes are welcoming but certainly not friendly, if that makes any sense. The people, of course, are the same as everywhere else in the world, and much more likable than the government, obviously. But without progress on the first front, in fact, it's getting worse-- how can I see a future here, even if I have local friends? I tried my part.

China,3cenge,deck_hand,10,Tue Jul 7 12:46:10 2015 UTC,I doubt that a 4 month reduction is going to be that noticeable after 150 years of carbon dumpage.
China,3cenge,Hautamaki,3,Tue Jul 7 13:19:13 2015 UTC,"The entire claim of Climate Change scientists is that our emissions contribution have made an enormous increase in global CO2 levels.  For thousands of years, they claim, we stayed around 270 parts per million, climbing from that level to about 316 parts per million from the beginning of the Industrial Age until about 1956.  In the next 59 years, we have supposedly increased our CO2 levels to 400 parts per million, due to human released emissions alone.    We see seasonal changes quite well, and see variations from one year to the next, and can show that economic activity in the US alone affects the amount of CO2 levels.  I think a massive drop in the largest carbon dioxide emitter on the planet from 8000 megatons to 500 megatons should be noticeable, don't you?"
China,3cenge,deck_hand,3,Tue Jul 7 13:33:30 2015 UTC,"if it's sustained for long enough, sure, of course.  But many scientists already believe that even if we stopped all CO2 emissions immediately, it would still already be too late to prevent catastrophic climate change because temperature and climate change lags decades behind CO2 levels, and we haven't got a fast enough way of getting rid of the carbon already in the atmosphere.  In other words, the hot temperatures we are experiencing today are a result of the carbon we dumped in the 60's and 70's, and it will continue to get worse for at least another 50 years before it gets better, even if we stopped all greenhouse gas production yesterday.  But yes, such a massive decrease in the present rate of pollution should move the needle at some point.  I don't know if 4 months is enough time to notice though.  Besides, although China may be the single largest producer of greenhouse gases, there are so many major players in the pollution market that China alone reducing emissions doesn't make a big enough difference.  The amount of CO2 released by burning forests all around the world, for example, is a more serious problem than China burning coal.  Particularly because those forests are the main things that would be taking the CO2 out of the air normally."
China,3cenge,Hautamaki,4,Tue Jul 7 14:04:30 2015 UTC,"But many scientists already believe that even if we stopped all CO2 emissions immediately, it would still already be too late to prevent catastrophic climate change because temperature and climate change lags decades behind CO2 levels,    Maybe you misread my post.  I said nothing about temperature, or the effects of increased CO2 levels.  My comment was that if China has indeed reduced emissions, we should be able to detect that reduction in our measurement of CO2 levels.     The amount of CO2 released by burning forests all around the world, for example, is a more serious problem than China burning coal.   While this may be a bigger problem than China's emissions from coal, the reported CO2 emissions from China is much larger than the estimated emissions of the burning of forests.  Since what we are talking about here is emissions and the growth of atmospheric CO2, it's important that we don't get sidetracked by saying ""well, this OTHER THING is more important.""  Also, Brazil is the nation where the largest forest clearing has been happening, and they have made great strides in reversing that trend in the last few years."
China,3cenge,deck_hand,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:16:07 2015 UTC,"The article said that China's levels for those 4 months dropped to the same amount of emissions as the UK. From the article:   Against all odds, China has made tremendous strides in the fight against CO2 emissions. In just four months, it reduced levels to the amount the UK emits in the same period.    Now, that's not 5%. That's like 95%.  We'd certainly be able to see that in the data.  Once again, they said:   To achieve these reductions, China has had to close more than 1,000 coal plants (it leads the world in coal consumption and greenhouse gas emissions). It managed to get levels down to the same amount the UK has emitted in the last four months.   I would believe a 5% reduction, but...  This must just be a very, very poorly written article.  It says, twice, that China reduced emissions to the same amounts that the UK emits."

Once you allow govts to come in and dictate that a market is not allowed to go down, it is no longer capitalism because you have removed one of the core tenets of capitalism. Think of it as Christianity without Jesus, Islam without Muhammad etc etc. That's how crucial allowing market swings BOTH ways is to capitalism.

China,3cdoub,GuestBob,9,Tue Jul 7 06:02:47 2015 UTC,"Trading has been halted in more than 25 per cent of Chinese listed shares, in what appears to be the latest government-backed attempt to shore up the country's plunging equities markets.  The suspension of more than 700 mainly smaller stocks listed in Shenzhen since June 12 failed to lift the markets on Tuesday morning.  Some 200 of those stocks halted trading before the market opened on Tuesday  The Shanghai Composite Index opened 3.2 per cent lower, while the Shenzhen Composite Index was down 3.44 per cent.  The technology-heavy ChiNext was off by 3.8 per cent.  Stock market services company, Wind, said the majority of the companies had suspended their shares ahead of major news announcements, while the others were embarking on a restructuring.  While the suspensions have not been directly ordered by the stock market regulator, they appear to be another attempt by authorities to shore up the markets. Smaller companies listed in Shenzhen have been the hardest hit during the three week stock market route.  ""If the government can credibly create a floor in the market then private investors might do the rest,"" said Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University, via phone from Beijing.  ""And you need to remember the government has a lot of fire power.""  Mr Pettis also questioned the idea that a big decline in the share market would affect the broader economy.  ""On the way up there were limited side effects on the economy and the effects are likely to be limited on the way down,"" he said.  China's central government has rolled out a series of policies to stabilise the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets over the last three weeks, after they lost a quarter of their value amid panic selling and wild fluctuations.  These measures have seen the halting of 28 initial public offerings, allowing the country's sovereign wealth fund to buy local shares, having the central bank provide liquidity for margin lending and forcing stock brokers to create the 120 billion yuan market stabilisation fund.  On Monday independent media group Caijing reported the National Social Security Fund had ordered its fund managers ""not to sell a single share"". The state-pension fund had $159 billion of assets at the end of last year, split between bonds and equities.  On Monday the Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.4 per cent, but the rise in the overall market disguised big falls among smaller stocks not linked to the government.  In a wild day of trading, 649 stocks fell, while only 259 rose in Shanghai as the country's 90 million retail investors appeared unconvinced by the government attempts to engender confidence.  Traders indicated the 120 billion yuan ($25 billion) stabilisation fund set up by the country's main stock brokers began buying large government-linked stocks in the afternoon, leading the Shanghai market higher."

China,3cdoub,Th3S1l3nc3,6,Tue Jul 7 07:42:17 2015 UTC,"IMHO angry workers and farmers are localised instances - they might involve a couple of hundred people max, and are relatively ""easy"" to contain.  According to media, the majority of shares are held by retail investors, not professional funds. That means there is a potentially very large body of people who have been losing money in a falling property market and share market.  It's also not just the immediate blowback - maybe Rocky and Rainy won't riot because they blew all their rambos on the market. But they will have learned that the Party was impotent. It increases disenchanment, so maybe the next time something bad happens, it will be the straw that broke the camel's back."
China,3cdoub,zakazaw,4,Tue Jul 7 08:07:16 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's just another trigger, one more problem Beijing has to control.  If the rest of the economy was dandy, and the Rocky/Rainy had great opportunities to invest their money for Baby Rockie's future and their retirement, it wouldn't be a big deal.  But this is really the only other option besides taking your money outside the country which is the last thing China wants them to do.  The problem is what happens in the future.  Will the average Chinese stop spending and investing their money, and just keep it locked away?  That'll kill the GDP, and Beijing can't prop up all these money losing companies f and keep injecting money into the banks forever.  If the GDP stops growing, and Beijing has to give up on all these failing companies, mass layoffs and unemployment will skyrocket.  Have no job, no savings and no investment opportunities, well, get the popcorn out, you think those village protests and taxi drivers are pissed, we haven't seen anything yet.  Beijing basically needs the stock market to survive.  Without it, they have reforms they can do that could probably straighten this out, but it will cause a lot of changes I believe most Chinese are not prepared for, and  the economy could get ugly for a little while with any drastic changes.  The party might not be able to survive a few ugly years to see if any reforms they do would work, so I imagine they are all nervous on the next move."

I was thinking that besides the property market, don't people also invest in P2P and other kinds of sketchy funds that offered 10% returns? I know a few people who do who are quite middle class. What about those? Though I've heard that P2P fund firms are in trouble recently , more instances of them just packing up and running.  I agree with the future and the stock market being kind of like a buffer to keep people happy while the economy slows down. A poster above mentioned something about the problem may not be stock investors rioting, but the loss of confidence and the next time being the straw that breaks the camel's back, which I think makes sense.  The issue is the stock market is not fully connected to the real economy. I don't have the figures on hand, but I've read somewhere that during the rise earlier this year, there was no real boost to the economy."

It's not like all these companies have magically changed their business since 2014. If it's a market correct, a company's business should trundle along exactly the same, irrespective of variations in the market price of its shares.   It's a market measure, pure and simple - either the government is instructing the companies to stop trading, or the insiders are applying for suspension to protect their own (possibly leveraged) portfolio.  The only exception is if these listed companies have themselves been playing the market (either by directly trading other companies' shares, or by pledging their own shares as collateral for loans). If that's the case (and it's certainly not unthinkable), then that's a very scary proposition - although I doubt any of the companies would ever admit it (why would you, when you can just pay off your auditors to cover it up).  Very interesting days ahead."

Not sure what the Chinese SX rules are but presumably it's the same as most places, i.e. shareholder approval is needed to establish an ESOP. Waste of money and time to do this post-listing - much cheaper/faster to do it before you IPO.  To be fair, I suppose a smaller company might not need one at the start, but eventually grow to the size where they do need one.  Again, I highly doubt that is the legitimate reason here. Odds are the executives are trying to freeze trading to prop up the stock price so they can cash out (or prevent further margin calls)."

China,3cdoub,zakazaw,8,Tue Jul 7 07:44:54 2015 UTC,"Trading has been halted in more than 25 per cent of Chinese listed shares, in what appears to be the latest government-backed attempt to shore up the country's plunging equities markets.  The suspension of more than 700 mainly smaller stocks listed in Shenzhen since June 12 failed to lift the markets on Tuesday morning.  Some 200 of those stocks halted trading before the market opened on Tuesday  The Shanghai Composite Index opened 3.2 per cent lower, while the Shenzhen Composite Index was down 3.44 per cent.  The technology-heavy ChiNext was off by 3.8 per cent.  Stock market services company, Wind, said the majority of the companies had suspended their shares ahead of major news announcements, while the others were embarking on a restructuring.  While the suspensions have not been directly ordered by the stock market regulator, they appear to be another attempt by authorities to shore up the markets. Smaller companies listed in Shenzhen have been the hardest hit during the three week stock market route.  ""If the government can credibly create a floor in the market then private investors might do the rest,"" said Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University, via phone from Beijing.  ""And you need to remember the government has a lot of fire power.""  Mr Pettis also questioned the idea that a big decline in the share market would affect the broader economy.  ""On the way up there were limited side effects on the economy and the effects are likely to be limited on the way down,"" he said.  China's central government has rolled out a series of policies to stabilise the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets over the last three weeks, after they lost a quarter of their value amid panic selling and wild fluctuations.  These measures have seen the halting of 28 initial public offerings, allowing the country's sovereign wealth fund to buy local shares, having the central bank provide liquidity for margin lending and forcing stock brokers to create the 120 billion yuan market stabilisation fund.  On Monday independent media group Caijing reported the National Social Security Fund had ordered its fund managers ""not to sell a single share"". The state-pension fund had $159 billion of assets at the end of last year, split between bonds and equities.  On Monday the Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.4 per cent, but the rise in the overall market disguised big falls among smaller stocks not linked to the government.  In a wild day of trading, 649 stocks fell, while only 259 rose in Shanghai as the country's 90 million retail investors appeared unconvinced by the government attempts to engender confidence.  Traders indicated the 120 billion yuan ($25 billion) stabilisation fund set up by the country's main stock brokers began buying large government-linked stocks in the afternoon, leading the Shanghai market higher"
China,3cek7w,100wordanswer,7,Tue Jul 7 08:18:24 2015 UTC,"For the lazy (FYI - no credited author & in two posts due to character limit):  Why China's Stock Markets Matter  JULY 6, 2015 | 09:30 GMT  Analysis  *Beijing will continue to intervene where possible to prop up markets and market sentiment.  *A collapse of the stock market would likely increase deposits in ordinary bank accounts.  *This would compel Beijing to rely more heavily on banks to fuel growth and pressure China to accelerate financial liberalization efforts as a way to cultivate household consumption.  The Shanghai Composite Index fell 6 percent on July 3, rounding out a 28 percent decline since June 12, when the country's stock markets peaked. The deterioration occurred despite intensive government efforts to stabilize prices and revive investor sentiment. Overt attempts by Beijing included cutting benchmark interest rates and reserve requirement ratios and loosening restrictions on investor access to margin loans, in addition to less overt moves, such as direct interventions to prop up the market with government-backed purchases of blue chip stocks. On Friday, in a clear bid to win investor confidence in its oversight abilities, the securities regulator announced it would investigate signs of potential market manipulation. Yet so far, Beijing's efforts have failed to achieve the desired effect of stimulating, or at least stabilizing, China's leading stock markets.  In the days and weeks ahead, Beijing will not meekly accept the natural winding down of the past year's stock boom turned bubble. Rather, it will continue to work, both overtly and covertly, to prevent prices from collapsing outright — all while seeking to reshape investor sentiment and expectations through investigations, like those recently announced. The question of why Beijing feels compelled to take action remains, especially when any intervention risks exacerbating whatever financial and political fallout may come from an eventual market decline or crash. The answer to this question lies in understanding the role of stock markets in China's economy and Beijing's broader policy priorities, as well as evaluating the potential effects of a stock market crash on both.  Nurturing Consumer Growth  The Chinese government's core policy goal — the crux of its entire economic reform and rebalancing program — is to cultivate a domestic consumer base capable of supporting nationwide growth that is stable, sustainable and less exposed to fluctuations in external demand. To do this requires a boost in average incomes to a level where non-essential purchases become feasible for ordinary people. Additionally, China needs to instill in its citizens a sense of financial security adequate enough to convince them to spend — rather than save — their disposable income.  China has struggled on both fronts over the past two decades. Until recently, China was a country of near-universal poverty. Its post-1978 economic growth model, grounded as it was in low-cost exports and state-led investment into infrastructure construction, necessitated two policies: the systematic repression of manufacturing wages to maintain the competitiveness of exports and the suppression of interest rates on savings deposits. Keeping interest rates low ensured cheap financing for China's state-owned sector, which was responsible for the vast majority of infrastructure development and which survived on credit from state-controlled banks. These factors, more than any supposed cultural inclination to save, explain China's extraordinarily low levels of private household consumption relative to other parts of its economy — and compared to consumption levels in other countries.  For China's leaders, a key question over the past two decades has been how to cultivate greater household consumption without undermining the low-cost export and government investment-led economic growth model. Doing so required creating investment avenues by which ordinary Chinese citizens could achieve returns on their savings that outpaced inflation, but which did not direct those savings away from domestic export and construction industries. Allowing ordinary Chinese to invest their savings overseas was clearly not an option — not only would it direct those savings away from the domestic economy, but the free flow of capital in and out of China would constrain the government's ability to manage the yuan's value. Bearing this in mind, China's leaders in the early 1990s settled on two approaches: commercial real estate markets and stock markets. Both would give ordinary Chinese new opportunities to invest their savings and reap the rewards while simultaneously directing those savings into key industries and sectors, including housing and infrastructure construction and the state-owned sector, which enjoys disproportionately higher representation on China's largest stock exchange.  The Real Estate Boom  For most of the past 20 years, commercial real estate was by far the dominant avenue for ordinary Chinese to invest their savings, with stock markets playing a minor and unsteady second fiddle. Real estate and related industries formed the single largest component of China's economy. As long as home sales and prices rose, as they did with extraordinary consistency for two decades, real estate provided an unrivaled investment opportunity, one firmly backed by the Chinese government. This was especially true after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis decimated China's low-cost export sector, amplifying the importance of construction-related industries for employment and social and political stability. In comparison, China's stock markets, bedeviled by opacity and poor regulations, floundered. By 2009, most ordinary Chinese viewed investing in stocks as akin to playing the lottery.  To the extent that real estate was the primary means for ordinary citizens to increase their wealth, it also became critical to Beijing's efforts to stimulate domestic consumption. This in part explains the government's hesitancy to implement the kinds of policies that in the long run would contribute to cultivating domestic consumption. In the near term, however, bringing in policies such as deposit rate liberalization would raise costs for the state-owned companies largely responsible for real estate-related construction.  Yet now, after peaking, China's housing has entered a period of protracted decline. With real estate-related investments no longer promising the returns they once did, and with China's economy slowing, Beijing must find new tools for supporting domestic consumption. This is especially critical given that China is no longer able to rely on low-cost exports or the housing sector. Beijing must now look to private household consumption and consumption-driven industries as the primary drivers of national economic growth.  China's Stock Market Boom  This is the backdrop against which the sharp, government-supported surge in China's stock markets over the past 12 months should be understood. It also helps explain why the government continues to support the stock market even as it becomes clear that the market is a bubble, and even as investor leverage rises, alongside the financial risks of a market collapse. In short, a collapse in the stock market, in a climate of stagnant-to-negative growth in real estate, would almost certainly lead to a drop in household consumption and thus in consumption-driven industries. This is exacerbated by an environment that lacks substantial alternative investment avenues, in a period of slowing economic growth, slowing wage increases and rising unemployment.  Private consumption is increasingly critical, not only to Beijing's long-term reform goals but also to maintaining economic growth, employment, and social and political stability in the near term. Beijing seeks to avoid, as long as it must, any actions that infringe on private consumption. If stock markets collapsed tomorrow, the most immediate effect — beyond widespread but containable ire over lost savings and a significant hit on business cash flows — would be a surge in state-backed bank deposits as ordinary investors move their capital to the only place offering safe, if modest, returns.  This is not necessarily a bad thing for Beijing. After all, China's state-controlled banking sector would be flush with capital and in a stronger position to pump credit into the economy as needed. At the same time, it would likely cut against the underlying thrust of China's reform and rebalancing program — specifically, the need to curb wasteful state-led investment, reduce the state-sector's reliance on artificially cheap financing and improve the ability of banks to price risk. All of this could ultimately combat the widespread capital misallocation that has characterized every prior instance of massive state-backed credit expansion in China. Over the past year, banks have become an increasingly important source of corporate financing. Amid a collapse in the stock market, a rapid surge of deposits into banks would force Beijing to turn once again to the financial sector to support the economy. In all likelihood, this would lead to a repeat of the same speculative bubbles that attended the post-2008 stimulus drive."
China,3cek7w,impossinator,6,Tue Jul 7 08:23:52 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, Beijing could try to compel banks to hang onto the surge in savings rather than expanding lending. This would realistically be done by raising deposit interest rates. Such a move would almost certainly trigger an economy-wide crisis as the state-owned sector, already suffering falling profits and hefty debt repayment costs, collapses. It would also be an enormous boon to ordinary Chinese citizens, who continue to park the vast majority of their funds in savings deposits. By forcing a broad restructuring of Chinese industry, this would substantially accelerate the central government's long-term reform plans. It remains doubtful that the Communist Party government could survive such a crisis intact. At any rate, it is highly improbable that Beijing would raise interest rates, a policy that stands a strong chance of undermining state security in the immediate term.  A Choice of Evils  This is the basic conundrum China's leaders face in determining whether and for how long to sustain the current stock market boom. Barring a radical lifting of restrictions on overseas investment or a sharp increase in deposit rates, China effectively lacks channels for ordinary citizens to generate wealth beyond investment in real estate and stocks. Real estate is slowing, weighed down by years of accumulated oversupply. It no longer promises the returns it once did. If stocks decline, it is unclear what else ordinary people can rely upon to generate returns. The impact of a stock market decline on private consumption growth would only compound its effects on corporate balance sheets and investment, and thus on employment and economic growth.  The bottom line is that Beijing has an underlying interest in ensuring that China's stock markets do not collapse. Therefore, the government will likely continue to intervene to the best of its ability, propping up markets and market sentiment whenever the risk of a major sell-off becomes too great. This does not mean that stock prices won't slide further, or that the market will stabilize — indeed, it could well become even more volatile over the coming months. But it does reinforce the fact that until Beijing invents more avenues for investment, or unless it embraces interest rate hikes and any post-crisis restructuring, it will have to rely on the few tools available to ensure that citizens can generate the wealth and financial security they need to consume. Beijing's reform goals, as well as the ability to manage China's slowdown, depend on this."

China,3cej1k,Stuffe,4,Tue Jul 7 08:01:13 2015 UTC,"EDIT: People, This is super alpha software with a terrible implementation compared to an actual VPN. If you use this, assume everyone and anyone can read your traffic. Do not install random software from unknown people.  I am happy to give it a try, but could you give some more info first?  How many exit servers do you have?  Where are the exit servers?  What is your logging policy?  Are the connections shared IP?  What kind of tunnel? Ssh?"
China,3cej1k,ragnaruss,2,Tue Jul 7 09:04:21 2015 UTC,"Good questions!   Right now the software is only using one server, but this will change depending on loads. The server is in Singapore because mostly because it was fast Right now I log a unique ""Device ID"" calculated by (one way) hashing your Mac address, I log the amount of data downloaded by this device ID and the last time this device ID requested something from the server. This stuff is important to this beta test, but basically I don't log anything that should identify you. I also don't really care about your IP. And 10 minutes ago I just finished a counter for downloads of the program. Policy wise I haven't thought about it, but I guess I wont log anything personal to you, I will never seek to profit from any data obtained by you in any way and I will be fully transparent if you ask about how/what I log. Yes the connections share the server IP (when routed through the server that is). So basically your browser communicates with a proxy on your computer (loopback) and that proxy attempts to retrieve any domain directly, without using the server, unless its on a list of domains already known to be blocked (list is about 20k domains long). If it doesn't connect within 2 seconds, it will stop trying for the next hour and instead reroute requests to this domain through the server. Your proxy then tells the server what it wants together with its device ID and the communication starts. All bytes of this communication is xor'ed and the server passes the request on to the target website."
China,3cej1k,ragnaruss,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:26:28 2015 UTC,"What Hashing algo do you use for generating the DeviceID? It's not wise to use a MAC even with one way hashing, I suggest you have your client side generate a UUID4 to use as the device ID, so it doesn't tie back to hardware.  How do you log the amount of data?  How is DNS handled in your system?  What exact protocol do you use between the client and the proxy?   What do you xor the data with?"
China,3cej1k,ragnaruss,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:15:52 2015 UTC,"This is the ""quick and dirty"" first version so its just the MAC address hashed with Pythons build in hash function which i actually don't know much about. Next version will probably use UUID4, although I am pretty sure that is also just the MAC address and a bunch of other stuff hashed together? The server records the amount of data up and down for each request session and updates a mysql table with the amount of data that was downloaded: (len(buffer) in python) The localhost proxy tries to look up DNS domains and goes through the server if it cant resolve. The server then attempts to resolve. This is actually something I want to improve on later and proxy all DNS requests and put them in cache for 24 hours (for server and client), since I bet the great firewall also uses DNS blocks (it uses various tricks, like for example resetting established connections). I wrote this code myself so I guess you can call it ChinaUnblock protocol. Here's a line from the code that preceeds the data exchange:     self.target.send(sxor(passkey+"":""+self.device_id+"":""+version+"":""+self.host+"":""+str(self.port)+""#headers-end#""))    I xor every byte individually with ""a"", since I don't want to deal with the hassle of padding, data not arriving in order etc. That would also slow things down. Initially I didn't obfuscate the data exchange at all, but the firewall recognized proxy data and terminated connections. The aim of this program is to give people access to the web at large, it's not made to be an extra layer of privacy as such."
China,3cej1k,ragnaruss,2,Tue Jul 7 16:56:16 2015 UTC,"UUID1 use MAC I believe, UUID4 uses random numbers. It's a little concerning that you don't know exactly which hashing algo is used.  Like it or not, you are building something that could easily end up in the hands of people who are relying on it to protect them as equally as a competitors system such as SSH or OpenVPN (atsrill). It's one thing to build a hobby tool as an challenge, its another thing to start giving it to people and letting them use it thinking they are secure.  Your post needs to have a big ass disclaimer at the top saying ""This software will not protect you in anyway from anyone who wants to look at your internet. It is not secure, it should not be used for anything real world.""  I know I am coming across as a dick, but this kind of thing can be serious. xoring things with ""a"" is NOT encryption, do not call it that, it is misleading. You are attempting to recreate stream ciphers, which have been around for a long time and are well understood.  You should not cache DNS requests in software in my opinion, unless you provide a way to purge that cache. All DNS requests should go through the tunnel, it's not wise to mix and match.  Your protocol format is really inefficient and it could be simplified, why do you need to send the passkey every time? There should be an authentication phase and then the device id should be enough, certainly for the next x number of requests. ""#headers-end#"" is 13 bytes more data where you could just use ASCII code 4, End of Transmission. Version could also be part of the authentication phase and be cached server side for the duration of the session.  It's very important you understand that when providing tools to get around blocks like china has, the tool has to provide an implicit extra layer of security. In most cases, the fact you are accessing and posting to the web at large is exactly the thing the regimes have trouble with."
China,3cej1k,ragnaruss,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:42:10 2015 UTC,"First off, in regard to pretty much all your comments, this is a beta built in about 3 days, there is a reason the version number is v0.1 and not everything was build as it is supposed to look long term.  For your first point I don't have anything useful to do with anyone's MAC addresses, it was just a quick way to get a unique id from each user without bloating the file by importing another library. People on your local network can obtain your MAC easily so they don't have any reason to sniff it and I don't have any use for it either. I will might just end up bloating the file anyway and either use UUID4 or SHA256 next update, so we can pack this concern far away.   xoring things with ""a"" is NOT encryption   It's not encryption, just enough obfuscation that it passes through the firewall and with as little overhead as possible. I don't care about an extra layer of encryption when browsing and I am willing to bet that 99% of people in China don't use VPN's for the extra encryption. Although this is still better than browsing without any VPN, it was not build for this purpose, it is build for browsing the internet fast. That being said, I will be more careful with my wording. (Edit: I might add stream cipher encryption as an option you can enable, but it will be slower, since it can desync if bytes don't arrive in the correct order).   Your post needs to have a big ass disclaimer at the top saying ""This software will not protect you in anyway from anyone who wants to look at your internet. It is not secure, it should not be used for anything real world.""   That does come of as confrontational honestly and really uncalled for. Yes it is only slightly more private than browsing without any VPN in the first place but certainly not worse in any way. I hope you are man enough to retract that comment.   Your protocol format is really inefficient and it could be simplified, why do you need to send the passkey every time? There should be an authentication phase and then the device id should be enough, certainly for the next x number of requests. ""#headers-end#"" is 13 bytes more data where you could just use ASCII code 4, End of Transmission. Version could also be part of the authentication phase and be cached server side for the duration of the session.   I don't actually remember why I used 13 bytes instead of just 1, that does look rather silly, but I am not too ashamed, because there was probably a good reason for it at some point and this is not at all finished. I think when I get to it I will have the first request generate a session identifier that will be passed back to the client and having passkey and device id fixed length I could remove a couple of colons too, in that first request.   It's very important you understand that when providing tools to get around blocks like china has, the tool has to provide an implicit extra layer of security.    Only now do I understand what you meant when you said this program shouldn't be used, you are paranoid that the Chinese government actually cares what you do online?  Firstly even freaking reddit uses SSL encrypted these days (and not to be a dick back at you but you confused SSH with SSL in one of your previous posts). When you follow Dalai Lama on facebook, facebook has you covered and when you search for Falun Gong, google has you covered. 99% of the time when you do anything that could be remotely sensitive in anyway, then the service you are using has got you covered with SSL, they can't assume that you are using a VPN after all. Secondly, the Chinese government doesn't actually care about those thing either, they just want to block it from you. Go ahead and search for those things on Baidu and see how long it will be before the police kicks down your door (it will be a long night). And lastly, if you really are planning to overthrow the Chinese government or something, then I hope you are smart enough not to use a service that has a picture of Mao Zedong and the text ""Nihao Internet"" on the front page. This service is not meant for you.  And by the sound of it, I could say the same to you. I don't work in corporate programming and have nothing but distaste for the corporate philosophy of coding. I am a hacker more than anything. I am not overly paranoid and so I don't spend much time debating which hashing algo I should use for non sensitive data. I also don't care what the general and often seemingly arbitrary consensus is on anything, as for example DNS caching in client software. Back your suggestions up with arguments, not what you think is should be a general rule. My general rule is I don't follow general rules unless there is a sound logical argument to do so.  And I don't like to overly flesh out every aspect of what I am building before I build it, my ""protocol"" looks the way it does now, not because I sat down and wrote a report about it. It looks like it does now because I tested an idea I thought was cool, then I got it to work and needed some extra variables to log how the server would respond when I compiled it and gave it to a bunch of people on reddit and eventually I will change it again because it is an ugly hack.  What I actually care about is how fast I can make something and how useful I can make it, which is how you get from nothing to this in 3 days."
China,3cej1k,superPwnzorMegaMan,3,Tue Jul 7 19:55:30 2015 UTC,"It taking 3 days is far from a reasonable excuse for you to explain your decisions, better ways of doing it would have taken just as little time. You don't use the MAC address because your mac is not broadcast past the local router generally, but you're system does. Congrats, there is now solid proof that X device was doing Y action. If you want a unique ID, generate a proper UUID, that's what it's designed for.  You understand that if more than a few people use your system, the Chinese will know and block it? You understand that the GFW is mostly powered by some clever as fuck deep packet inspection and heuristics? Right now you are relying on them not knowing you exist for it to work, and that means its entirely pointless to offer it to the masses.  It is worse, because you tout it with words like ""encryption"" and ""tunnel"", which non tech people have come to associate with common meanings. When you use them but they aren't true, you put people at risk. Some lawyer or someone who gets told about it by a friend on /r/china could end up using it thinking they are safe when they are not. A false sense of security (which is all you give really) is dangerous.  Perhaps use the sessionId after it has been generated as the only required data, like cookies.  Now for the big one:  It's not about me being paranoid, its about someone calling shit out that can hurt people. What happens if someone uses your broken toy and does end up getting into shit for it? It happens, china makes an effort to find and punish dissent, even when online. You are new here so I don't expect you to realize or to know about them arresting people for posting dirty stories online, or people getting in trouble for posting rumors.  It's also worth you remembering that there have been issues with Chinese certificate authorities that make your ""google has you covered"" pretty ridiculous.  As for your stab at ""corporate coding"", I don't work for a corporate coding company, I run my own company. The difference is not that I am corporate, it's that I am competent. The reason not to mix and match as far as DNS goes is because then you need to write the code that matches to ""good"" or ""bad"" domains. That's another potential avenue for mistakes, how do you get that list? Is it downloaded? Is it secure? How often is it updated? If they can replace the list of good and bad, maybe mess with it so certain random domains don't get resolved via the tunnel but by theirs they now have a way to know when people are looking for certain sites. Leakage is bad, better to just pipe all via the tunnel.  The simple reality is you can here asking for beta testings for what is a pre-alpha idea with a bad implementation. You used words that give people certain expectations without actually meeting them. You asked for feed back and I am giving it. Sure I am a bit of a dick about it, but you are not the first newbie to come by with some revolutionary new idea to jump the wall.  Finally, I didn't mistake SSH and SSL. When you use common vernacular like tunnel, people will often assume your are using SSH. I am well aware of the difference between SSH and SSL/TLS/OpenVPN."

Labor is more expensive, Rental is more expensive and Chinese Contract mfg are outsourcing their production to places like Vietnam. Chinese Yuan is not undervalued. It has been allowed to flactuate within a band since '06, and after this trend over the last few years, where it moved from 8.2RMB to 1USD it is now hovering around 6.2RMB to 1USD. This is part of a larger plan to make RMB an international currency. This encourage imports and balances trade bit by bit. China is still the largest exporter of mfg goods in the world though slightly edging out EU and about 30% more than US Do not deal with Chinese business people without a really trusted individual who has experience dealing with Chinese people.  China is a consumer driven economy. There is a huge market for white goods, and probably the largest market for most consumer goods like automobiles and FMCG. It's consumer market is around 4 trillion US$. of course US is around 12 trillion US$, but 4 trillionUS$ is the second largest.

China,3cg5vs,very_bad_advice,6,Tue Jul 7 17:56:03 2015 UTC,"Actually I want to add to this. There are 2 chinas, and I don't mean Taiwan and China. I mean within PRC itself there is rural China which retains many of the characteristics of pre-Industrial China and Urban China.  Urban China is huge. It's at least twice the population of United States. You see it on the news, it's the gleaming skyscrapers and the huge factories and malls. it's also the podonk towns that border Tier III cities, where the denizens don't speak very good Mandarin, and still till their single Mu of farm and sell it in the town market. That is still part of urban china. Their children go to school in town and dream of moving up the socio-economic ladder, perhaps getting that high paying job (at least 10x more than what the family earns) in Foxconn after graduating from Technical High School  However there is a rural china - not connected to any cities, people ride on buffalo if they can afford beast of burdens, they sow and eat what they produce, and barter with their neighbours. This population is also as large as Urban china.  The first is a consumer-market. Those lucky 100 million individuals (just 7-8% of the total population of China) who live by the coast or in Wuhan, CQ, Chengdu, Changsha or any large regional city can buy cars, TVs washing machines, iPhones and iPads, invest in stocks, property etc. Then the less lucky 400-500 million, who are on the verge and fighting to be part of this lucky 100 million who are saving to send their children to schools, buying them knock-off Leva's jeans, or pilfering a couple of Beats earphones off the production line during the QA inspection phase. Maybe they can make it within this generation, but surely their children can live in condominiums and get a nice office job within 2 decades.  The often ignored story is the other half of China, those not even aware there is a fight, or doesn't realize how different the lives are of those that take part is.

China,3cepsa,upads,0,Tue Jul 7 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"It is a bad analogy: you don't need to know every commonwealth variant spelling, just the knowledge that some words in commonwealth English are spelled differently, as well as the general rules for the different spellings.  An equivalent situation would be when Chinese teachers teach mandarin to foreigners. Should the teachers teach their students all the 别字 and 异体字, and dialect substitutions for words which they may or may not encounter? No, nor do they currently."
China,3cepsa,TheDark1,0,Tue Jul 7 17:39:59 2015 UTC,"I think the real point is that a good teacher prepares a student for as many situations as possible, and knowing the difference between ""learned"" and ""learnt"" is hardly having to know ""every commonwealth variant spelling"", as your strawman so lovingly illustrates.  English students in China will eventually encounter both American and British spelling variations and just sticking to teaching one because it's convenient makes you a bad teacher."

China,3ccb82,hypatia02,10,Tue Jul 7 01:26:19 2015 UTC,"No, the dispute started when China began trying to dispute Japan's sovereignty over the islands almost a hundred years after they claimed them.    'Nationalising' the islands consisted merely of the Japanese government buying the few remaining islands they did not own from their Japanese private owner.  This was an internal matter of Japan, China needs to follow its own advice and change its attitude, learn the facts, and stop interfering in other countries' internal affairs.    Perfect example of a situation where if you want to start trouble (China) because you're unhappy with the status quo, you will take any and every pretext to do so."

China,3ccb82,Rampaging_Bunny,5,Tue Jul 7 02:22:35 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's not quite right.  The owner had agreed in principle to sell the island to the then governor of Tokyo, who had no definite plans except to assert Japanese sovereignty in some unmistakable and unhelpful way.  The central government saw this and decided to prevent his doing so, and negotiated directly with the family that owned the islands for many decades.  The islands were then sold to the central government, and they're now treated just like most of the uninhabited islands surrounding Japan -- nothing can be built, and most of them may not legally be landed upon without permission."
China,3ccb82,impossinator,2,Tue Jul 7 02:26:44 2015 UTC,The islands originally slanted towards the Qing back then and was forcefully annexed after the Sino-Japanese War of 1895.  So yeah it was an island that was obtained through aggression and I don't see how righteous the cause of keeping it is.

But misusing a monopoly is illegal in many countries.    Your question seems to mix the question of having a very high market share, and abusing that position.  I don't even know what you mean by earned dominance - I guess you are trying to draw the line between a monopoly in a free market and one that is protected by its government from competition."
China,3cdz1j,Smirth,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:19:53 2015 UTC,"It's very possible my understanding of what exactly qualifies a monopoly is incorrect.  I don't mean situations in which no one can compete solely because the product already fills the market completely, like WeChat (what I called ""earned dominance"")  I mean situations where the monopoly actively bullies competition out of the market (buying all the railroads, and charging exorbitant fees to competitors, or forcing retailers/3rd parties to not offer competing goods).  Does Tencent do this?"
China,3cdz1j,malariasucks,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:32:14 2015 UTC,"It's very possible my understanding of what exactly qualifies a monopoly is incorrect.   What qualifies as a monopoly is high market share.  What you are confused about is that you think that being a monopoly is inherently evil or bad or illegal.  It's not, it is just high market share.  If you then use that position to push competition out of the market or unfairly squeeze people who want access to your position or move into other markets using your monopoly in a way others can't then THE ACTIONS can  possibly be illegal.  I don't know enough about Tencent's market position or business practices to comment on whether they have a monopoly or whether they are abusing it."
China,3cdz1j,Smirth,2,Tue Jul 7 08:08:13 2015 UTC,"What qualifies as a monopoly is high market share.   no, being the only competitor in the market means monopoly"
China,3cdz1j,JillyPolla,2,Tue Jul 7 12:49:41 2015 UTC,"First, I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, etc.  Let's start at the beginning.  The word monopoly itself means a complete ownership of the market, no competitors.  You are right on this point.  However, OP's question was regarding ""By US standards"", so I think that means you should interpret it by the Sherman Act.  This law says having the ability to control prices via a monopoly is bad, mmmkay?  However since the act was passed, actually the interpretation has been that if you want to go after a company, you need to prove they both have a monopoly, and they used it to do something anti-competitive.  In this case, defining a monopoly as having zero competitors doesn't help anyone.  If my company sells 10 billion beers and you sell one beer -- that doesn't mean I have competition and therefore can do what I like.    So for purposes of the Sherman Act usually it's 75% market share that is considered an effective monopoly.   So for example, despite the existence of Linux and MacOS and BSD etc, Microsoft was found to have a monopoly on operating systems and punished for telling PC manufacturers to distribute Internet Explorer if they wanted to pre-install Windows on their PCs.     This was intended to stop Microsoft using their monopoly position on operating system to tie purchases of Windows to the lucrative future market of web browsers.  Although in hindsight it might seem a little weird to think that we would be expected to buy a computer that doesn't necessary have the ability to browse web pages."

China,3cegud,bozmonster,2,Tue Jul 7 07:30:22 2015 UTC,"Mao and Stalin had a relationship that saw each of them as the supreme leaders of each of their respective nations.  Mao (as far as I know) never sought a union of their countries but he did seek leadership of the communist world.   Until the death of Stalin, Mao submitted to his leadership in virtually all aspects from the Korean War to the Berlin airlift in the vain hope that once Stalin died, he could assume the mantle of leadership.   When Stalin died and Kruschev had zero intention of submitting to Mao, Sino-soviet relations began to crumble.    Perhaps this is what your grandfather was referring to when he said the two countries sought a union."

China,3cegud,Truth_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:19:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds extremely unlikely. While Mao was cordial towards Stalin, behind closed doors he despised him due to multiple requests from both Mao and Jiang for the USSR to open a northern front against the Japanese having been turned down by Moscow. Adding salt to the wound was Stalin finally declaring war on Japan in 1945, just weeks before it looked to be all over, so that the USSR could demand part of the spoils, mainly land, on China's expense. Mao never forgave this dick move."

China,3cegud,Hautamaki,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:36:09 2015 UTC,"USSR and China had an ambivalent relationship since the later 1800's. At first the USSR supported China's conversion from dynastic rule to communism, however, once the true face of Chinese communism emerged the USSR was much less impressed with China. USSR was hoping China would take their form of communism, which would fit their plans of expansion of communist ideology; when this did not happen they were disappointed, and while they didn't sever all ties with China, their relationship was strained. Nor did the USSR do anything to stop it either, because communism, although not their vision of it, was still communism.   In terms of Chinese-Russian joint military operations, the only one that comes to mind is the Korean War, when the PLA assisted the Russian forces. Otherwise China was fighting Russia over land occupation (particularly in the northern regions and Mongolia).   Your Grandad is misinformed, sorry OP."
China,3cegud,ktechmidas,-1,Tue Jul 7 23:14:26 2015 UTC,"Nope.  I could imagine it as some kind of scam that Mao tried to play, but I know a fair amount about Mao and his life and I've never heard him trying to run that particular scam.  Stalin would have never bought it in any case.  However, I can understand how this idea might have come about and gotten into the 'psychosphere'.  Because around the time that Stalin was getting old and Mao was starting to have international ambitions, having already secured China and 'defeated' (in his own mind) the USA in a land war in Korea, Mao started to bandy about that he was the true successor to Stalin as head of Comintern.  And he was shipping food all over the communist world trying to buy favor with other comintern states (while his own people were starving in the tens of millions of course but yes I'm sure it's all the fault of bad weather and accidental economic missteps). And this right here is perhaps the first key catalyst to the eventual tension and even hostility between the USSR and China that began during Kruschev's reign.  Stalin was never too worried about Mao because Stalin knew he was always just as ruthless and Machiavellian as Mao was, and he had a massive  technological advantage, so he felt he could control Mao.  But Kruschev, as history would later show, wasn't quite as sociopathic as Mao or Stalin.  He was smart enough to know that there was nothing Mao wouldn't do for his megalomania, so he felt he had to be more careful with Mao."

This combination doesn't have any meaning.  The three lines on the left seem like they were written by someone who had just learned to write. Don't make sense either. 我 - me; 他的小妹子好 - his little sister is a good lass; 相片这(不?) - photo this (no?).  The two lines on the right were written by someone who used to write a lot, you could see it from the semi-cursive style. Again, no sense to be made. 这个兴(工?)(unknown)旦 - this promotion(?) (work?)

China,3ce67v,GuestBob,6,Tue Jul 7 08:00:24 2015 UTC,"June 21, 2015 1:38 pm For China the end of the Communist party is nigh — but in name only Daniel Bell  The writer is a professor at Tsinghua University and author of ‘The China Model’  China’s economic troubles and increasingly rigid ideological controls have led prominent China watchers to forecast the crack-up of its political system. I share the view that the Chinese Communist party may soon be extinct — but the extinction will be in name only. In fact, the CCP is neither communist nor a party. Few Chinese believe it will abolish the market economy and lead the march to higher communism. It is “Leninist” in the sense that it is vertically organised and rules supreme over the state apparatus but it lacks other vital features, such as the idea that class conflict is the motor of history, a commitment to the idea of communism at home, and support for revolutionary overthrow of capitalist regimes abroad.  And the days of Leninist-style political mobilisation are long gone because the party must be sensitive to public opinion. The CCP can mobilise around causes such as its anti-corruption drive if there is already social demand; but no longer around hare-brained schemes such as the Great Leap Forward, which radically conflict with what people want and what most scholars see as sensible. Nor is the CCP a political party. In the past three decades, it has (re-)established a meritocratic system similar to that of imperial China: government officials are selected using exams, then promoted based on performance on lower rungs. With 86m members, the CCP is a pluralistic organisation that co-opts leaders of different sectors of society, including keen capitalists, and it aims to represent the whole country. It is puzzling that the CCP should cling to its name given widespread antipathy in China to communism. Even party members distrust Marxism, and most students dread their compulsory Marxism classes. The very idea of a party that represents part of the population also has negative overtones. Confucius criticised quarrelsome people who associate along party lines, and surveys in China show a preference for “guardianship discourse” with elites responsible for the good of the whole society. So why does the CCP stick with the name? It makes sense to change it to something — say, the Chinese Meritocratic Union — that better corresponds with the reality of the organisation, as well as to what it aspires to be. In informal political talk in Beijing, there is often agreement that the name should be changed. It is also recognised that it cannot be changed now because the organisation still draws on CCP history for its ideological legitimacy. Yet the past 30 years have on balance been positive; and furthermore the CCP is increasingly looking to the long run of Chinese history for ideological legitimacy. The more it identifies with pre-revolutionary history, the more it can distance itself from the recent past. The days of Leninist-style political mobilisation are long gone because the party must be sensitive to public opinion Most important is to improve political meritocracy. The CCP does not need a unifying ideology, so long as people agree that the political system does a good job of selecting public officials with superior qualities. The pressing problem of corruption casts doubt on the question of virtue. So the anti-corruption campaign is essential to buttressing the legitimacy of the CCP, though we will not see results for a few years. Another reason the name cannot be changed now owes more to Confucianism than to communism. Revolutionary heroes who fought to establish a great nation are still attached to the name. Filial piety is a core value in China, and dutiful sons and daughters should not upset the elderly — especially those who sacrificed for the country. Sometimes harmony matters more than truth. In a couple of decades, however, the generation of revolutionary heroes will have sadly left this world. At that point, there will be less reason to stick to an obsolete name that needlessly casts the ruling organisation in a negative light. So here is my prediction. In 2035, the CCP will still be in power but it will not be called the CCP.  High quality global journalism requires investment.

Where to put your money in China?  Nowhere is safe now.  So all that money is going to be sent overseas to America and Canada, which hurts the long-term growth prospects for China since nobody will be willing to invest in the market scam, and the housing market is all but vanished for newcomers.  They will be extremely foolish to believe 7% GDP growth is still possible if people refuse to invest their money domestically.  The government only opportunity here is to propaganda the hell out of this and make people believe the problems are coming from the West, and convince them the long-term the market is a safe place to invest.  Make people believe in their stock market, and continue to unload the coffers with more and more cash to make it appear that Chinese dream is still possible.

China,3ccpzm,skullblasta,7,Tue Jul 7 00:06:18 2015 UTC,"China eased regulations on its market coupled with the fact real estate has become less attractive, which means investors are looking for new options.  So lots of folks rushed in to stocks and the market grew.  However in these situations the market tends to grow too much and correct.  Basically look at this way.  You have an item currently worth 25 dollars that should in reality be worth 50 dollars.  However as lots of people rush out to buy this item its price will temporary spike up to 80 dollars.  Then people will realize 80 is too much, the price will drop back to 40, and then eventually stabilize around 50 dollars.   The item is undervalued when it is below 50 and overvalued when it is above it.  But in China the GDP always grows 7% and now it seems the stock market can't drop, so China is basically trying to keep that 80 dollar overvalued price for the item as the item's price by spending money to purchase the item and keep that price spike going.  It's not working well and generally speaking the outcome of this method in the past has been to ensure when the price does crash rather than just drop to 40, it will drop to 15 or something and take much longer to recover."

Loan repayments  should only be a removal from liability and do not factor into operating expense. At most the finance cost of the interest counts as an expense but I doubt that will move the ticket too much.  A business making close to 392B and losing 550B is actually a viable business in the long run if it has huge depreciation in the earlier years. As the depreciation runs out over X number of years, it will be a profitable business. One needs to go into the Finance Report and scrutinize it.

China,3cbchr,Aan2007,6,Tue Jul 7 14:56:00 2015 UTC,"I lived in Danyang. 450,000 people (at the time). 4 foreigners, including my wife and I. (and we only met the other 2 foreigners two days before leaving)  I hadn't learned much Chinese yet, and the teachers at my school hardly spoke any English. It was a terrible experience and we couldn't wait to leave. The city had exactly 1 place that wasn't KTV, a barber shop, or a restaurant, that was open past 8pm. The wet market was cheap and accessible, but if you wanted foreign foods, you had to go to the 1 megamall (Auchan) and pray they had updated the International Aisle recently. Taxis were cheap as balls.  Started at 8Y for 3km, and 1.4Y/km thereafter. The only upside was that the high-speed rail station had just recently opened in the city, so travel to nearby cities was easy. Food was a nightmare because all the apartments sucked, and our kitchen sucked hard balls.  We were photographed constantly. The square in front of the school had dancing grannies every night. But not just a few dozen, this was the largest congregation of dancing grannies I'd ever seen. There were at least 300 every night. It was crazy.   The city sprawls a huge area, so the ""downtown"" (if you can call it that) was fairly empty.  To give an idea of how small the city was, there wasn't even a Starbucks or a McDonald's there! Only 2 KFCs (a third opened by the end of our stay).  Plus sides:     Super cheap. Wife would get her hair done (after lots of explaining) more than once a week for less than 25Y. We took yoga classes for 35Y/session. People were generally helpful and nice   We kinda hated it, but it grew on us. But being fairly young, it was super boring. Even the few people we met that were our age did absolutely nothing. Their idea of a fun night was buying tea at RnB, sitting in the dancing granny square, and going to bed by 8:30pm. We're glad we moved to Shanghai, but we miss some of the calmer aspects of Danyang too. In a weird way."
China,3cbchr,mrmdc,5,Mon Jul 6 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"I live in a city of about 900,000 or so. There's always plenty to do, as long as you like drinking on the street, playing pool, chatting with people, cookouts, and the like. I don't know what else to do even when I'm in a big city, so it's great for me. The one thing I miss is concerts. The artists who are desperate enough to come play for the five people who go to concerts at the one livehouse here aren't the best.  Having people stare at you everywhere is annoying, but eventually you go places enough times that people all get the 哪国家的 conversations out of the way, and that's it. Now I only really notice it when I go to the other side of town. Nobody bats an eye at the nearby rtmart, vegetable market, bar, night market, restaurants, buxingjie, etc. I get stared at more when I visit bigger cities than I do at home.  It's very cheap. I usually don't spend more than 10 kuai a meal, but a plate of dumplins or one dish and rice is enough for me. You can rent a place for <500 kuai a month. A taxi all the way across town runs about 10-11 kuai, but I usually take a bike. If it weren't for beer, movies, and my taobao addiction, my expenses would be borderline nothing. And yeah, anything not available in the city is available on taobao.  The negatives: The air sucks, especially when the farmers are burning the chaff, and people here are some of the most ignorant people I have ever seen in my entire life. In a lot of cases I can't blame them, but damn. Oh, and all the typical china stuff like shitting in the street, spitting in restaurants, etc amplified a few times. I'd also caution against moving out into T3-land unless you can get by in Chinese. I know one person who made it a year here with almost no Chinese, but I think more or less all the foreigners here (a dozen of us!) speak passable Chinese, because English-speaking Chinese people are very, very rare. If you can't, it's very hard to be independent, and you will probably get tired of seeing the same few foreigners all the time as your only social interaction."

China,3cbchr,finnlizzy,2,Tue Jul 7 00:35:58 2015 UTC,"I live in tier 3, a good tier 3 I guess but still nothing compared too tier 2 cities. It's big in both population and size which negates a lot fo the negatives. People here are also cash rich as it's on the yangtze delta money belt.   Plus Points  A lot of things are cheap. I live in the most expensive (I'm told) per square meter apartment in the city. It's the size of a hotel room though, but it only costs me 1700rmb. It's the nicest apartment I've ever lived in. Taxis star at 10 rmb and rarely go over. You can live for basically nothing if you are so inclined.   It's getting less now but there is still that ""Laowai Priviledge"" aspect to it. You get treated differently because you're a  laowai often annoying but sometimes it's pretty good.   Your chinese improves a lot if you let it, although a lot of people speak english here it's difficult to get round with no chinese. I didn't put much effort in past the first few months and I impress people in big cities with my chinese having only been here just over a year.  It's a different experience and you are forced out of the comfort zone of the big cities.   The pace of life is good here though. Shanghai feels so rushed to me now. Some nice parks and places to explore if you can motivate yourself to.   Cons  Where do I start? People arn't that great, both chinese and laowai. Most chinese are ignorant as fuck. Pee and spit everywhere smoke everywhere from small lifts to starbucks and do not give a fuck about anyone outside their family. They push, yell and fuck you over whenever they can.   Futher more the quality of young people here is kinda poor. I guess everyone who is progressive or smart enough to get a good job moves out as soon as they can. Most Chinese in their 20s are either married or on there way to being and only care about really trivial things. If I hadn't met some super cool people on my many travels to bigger cities and a few girls who were back for a while after being abroad you would have a really negative view of chinese people. Imagine going to america and only meeting rednecks I guess. You learn quickly that people only really want to befriend you here to either to use you as a status symbol or to exploit you in some way. You realise after awhile a lot of girls just wan't to date you because they are curious about waigouren and thing they have heard. It's hard to make any meaningful connection with chinese people.    Laowai tend to be really low quality aswell. There are some really cool fucking people here but they are few and far between. A lot of creepy old sexpats, esl drunks who have been here too long and clueless students on exchange programs for a few months. Lot's of drama and you get sick of seeing the same 20-30 people.  Also you can find yourself adapting to this and picking up bad habits.   There is very few things to do other than drink at one of the very few expat bars. Chinese clubs are awful and bars are overpriced and nonsense. It is near impossible to get decent western food. Most is catered to ""Chinese tastes which mean it's fucking awful and has had durian or pork floss added to it. Since subway closed down you are done for if you wan't a sandwich. Food is a massive problem unless you really like eating eggtarts and chicken feet everyday. No apartments have ovens and even buying bread is difficult.   It's a constand building site. Often projects get started and money falls through so they are left half built for the year. Lot's of drilling and fireworks almost every day as some new shop is opening   I will miss this place when I go though and to be honest I don't help myself. You can have nice things here just that it's 5-10x harder than back home or in Shanghai / Suzhou. You can see why people stay but you can also see why people leave after 2 weeks. I will be going in 6 weeks after I being here about 16 months. If I come back to china I will go to Suzhou or Shanghai having had a baptism of fire here. If you spend a lot of your time on your own, really like KTV and Chinese food, it's not too bad here. If you want decent conversation, western comfort every so often and a ""normal life"" then stay away at all costs. Like I said before Imagine you are from China and you move to backwater alabama or some northern english industrial town. You gonna have to go native pretty fast.   Also I you need to understand all the bullshit of normal china that I haven't listed is amplified massively"

Edit: Oh, I'd also like to share some anecdotal experience. I visited a Chinese friend's house and she showed me new Chopsticks she bought, I pointed out that they were Japanese. She took notice, exclaimed, ""Shit! I didn't know these were Japanese!"" and threw them away, then refused to answer why she wouldn't use Japanese chopsticks."

There is an understanding tat the guys your shooting are soldiers from WW2.  I agree it may not as separated as Germany now and German Nazis, but that's hardly the fault of the Chinese. The Japanese Emperor never abdicated, and they still allow the Yusakuni Shrine Museum to live in dead centre Tokyo - that describes the Berma rail as a glorious project that helped all South East Asians. Meanwhile, Japanese politicians openly justify their war in WW2.  If it was Germany, there be no Nazi sympathizing museum anyway, much less Berlin central.."

In regards to the RMB being cheaper which makes it more attractive, we cannot ignore Europe, China's second largest export destination - if the Euro depreciates as much as the RMB, then there's no change there except Europeans will already think twice about spending on non-essentials.

There is an entire class of investor who don't jump ship because they're confident when they come back in some time period (measured in years normally) they will have ended up making money and China might end up causing them to jump ship in all this.

China,3cab20,TheSonofLiberty,2,Mon Jul 6 10:01:14 2015 UTC,You have to ask the question why the CCP was/are so keen on rising stock prices. I say it is because high valuations allow public companies to raise money at favorable rates which can then be used to pay down debts. CCP knows many of these companies (which it partially owns) are in big trouble and they need to raise money from the masses to try and avoid or hide their troubles. It's an attempted state sponsored bailout and more looting of household savings. I'll be pleased to see the Chinese economy crash. It will bring the Australian economy down with it and one day young Australians will again be able to buy houses at reasonable prices.

I do want to see it correct enough despite the government efforts to break a bit of the facade of infallibility. Most Chinese who are angry at the government always blame it on a local official. Many of them have blind faith in the system, if not the actors- after thirty years of nonstop rises, a bit of a mild shock could do them well and maybe get people to think a bit more critically. I don't expect it to overturn anything- of course not.

One of which was having to register my name, address and other information in the county police office of the place where my husband's hukou is registered. This residence form I was supposed to get from that office was required to procces my visa/residence permit.   When I went to that office, I was informed that I was the first foreigner in the history of ever to come in and try to register. So they had no idea how to do it. I sat there for 40 minutes while they clicked through every tab and option in their computer program to find anything that could possibly be the form they were looking for.  I suggested they call the Fuzhou international marriage office and ask them how to do it. They did and we finally started making headway. But the officer that was responsible for typing my information into the computer system was... erm... kind of slow if you catch my drift.   When typing in my name, he got especially confused. He somehow got it into his head that my English name needed to be translated and typed in Chinese into the form. Now obviously there are no ""official"" translations for names, and even if there were it still wouldn't be my legal name because the only legal name I have is in English letters. I told him that the specific box he was looking at on the form was only for people who had actual Chinese names from birth. Like a Chinese person who acquired American citizenship and moved back to China. He got even more confused, ""But doesn't your husband call you by a Chinese name?"" He said. Well yeah, but that isn't my real name either! Just type it in English! ""How is that not your real name? And if I type it in English then no one can understand it.""   Then he actually starting looking up on Baidu what the ""proper translation"" of my English name is. Now for the record, my name is Samantha. After a while he piped up, ""Oh! I remember in the show Sex and the City there's that one girl named Samantha! Now what was her name translated as for the subtitles again?"" At that point I just lost all hope I had for the Chinese police force.   After my husband intervened and took 15 minutes of explaining to him that the name on the form has to match my passport exactly he finally got it.  All that trouble just to type in my frigging name."

I've actually been fairly impressed with the efficiency of some systems in China compared to my home country.  Eg getting a residency permit to stay in China was easier for me than my wife getting a tourist visa.  And can you imagine if you flipped it around and were a Chinese trying to apply for something in the west and there's no way to input Chinese characters?
China,3c91cg,laplumedematante,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:09:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know. After being married in China for over 2 years I helped my husband apply for a US tourist visa to go visit my parents and my hometown (he didn't want a greencard). He got rejected. And that was after like 4 months of hard work and waiting and an expensive stay in Guangzhou's 天河区 and visa fees and interviews. All for nothing.

Yeah, illegal.  Cop waves me down, and tells me to not take that road with an electric bike again.  He said ""Don't do this because it's the law, I want you to be safe!  The last thing I want is to scrape laowai guts off the side of the road.""   Waved me off with a smile, but it was pretty clear he, like cops everywhere for the most part, just want people to be safe.    3) Tried to check into a hotel that was doing the whole ""we can't accept white people"" thing. I called the cops on the spot, cop shows up and asks me why I'd want to give them business, instead he and his partner put me and my family up in a nice hotel a few blocks away for free, all while complaining about ""nongmins shouldn't be allowed to run hotels"".

China,3c91cg,robertodeleon,2,Mon Jul 6 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"There seem to be three types of cops in Beijing: the ones that kind of mooch around not doing very much; the ones that work in PSBs and have a regular daily grind; and the proper police who seem to give a shit about their jobs, but only pursue government-mandated justice (ie. investigating whatever is being cracked down upon at that point, and any threats to the status quo).  The first kind are basically useless, disempowered, lack authority and are incapable of directly solving any issues or problems.   The second kind are generally all right and just want to get on with their day. My local PSB doesn't give a shit if you forget to check in after going abroad - I've left it as late as a month before and they didn't care. I gather that in areas with fewer foreigners (so less to do, so more reason to alleviate boredom with questions and checks) they can be more strict.  The third kind are proper police, and actually know what they're doing. My sister was arrested during the crackdown in 2012 because her company put her on the wrong visa. All they wanted was for her to flip on the company, but they were pretty switched on and knew what they were doing.

Fight in a bar; cops didn't show up until about 30 mins after all parties had left the scene. Drunken game of catch with a football results in one player bending over the vandal-proof emblem on a benz. Owner comes out of the restaurant and claims 5000 yuan worth of damage to his car. Cops are called; senior cop wanders over, looks at the emblem, lifts it back up (the way it's designed to) and says ""There's no damage. Quit wasting everyone's time."" Then the benz man calls his friend who shows up in another expensive car, dressed like Don Johnston from Miami Vice days. More bullshit is being thrown around. When the price goes up from 5000 to 7000, one of the laowai rolls his eyes in exasperation and says ""fucking chinese!"" as he walks away. That instantly changed their tone.

China,3c91cg,ratsta,2,Mon Jul 6 06:23:05 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this police or military, things can be a little blurry in the TAR---When I was living as an international student in Lhasa, we all stayed there over winter holidays. The TAR basically shuts down to tourists in February and March due to Tibetan New Year and concerns about political unrest. The small handful of foreigners who live in Tibet long term are asked to leave the area--most go to Chengdu. As I noted above, I am not sure exactly if these are policemen or military, but whoever they are they get some pretty big guns and lots of body armor to walk around the marketplace in. Pretty friendly on the whole, however. They are often from outside the TAR and are assigned in units of two--one experienced with the TAR tour and one new to it all, which will become important later on.   During the week after New Year, I was walking around in the Tibetan market, doing my thing, buying some butter and yogurt, etc.. I have long blonde hair, so am pretty easily spotted as a laowai from a distance. Apparently, one of the police/guards sees me and thinks I am a secret tourist who snuck into Lhasa, because no one told him that the international students are allowed to stay for the winter. He gets really angry and starts yelling at me, but I don't notice because I am just sort of in my own headspace and people yelling is not really that abnormal in the market. Next he--who is apparently the new guy to the TAR tour--runs up and starts angrily pointing his gun at me, yelling in Chinese, which I obviously notice and nearly shit my pants. Meanwhile, his more experienced partner is running up and yelling, ""international student! international student!"" in Chinese. The more experienced guy arrives and pushes the man's gun down and explains I am an international student (there were only 19 of us, so the local PSB could recognize most of us by sight). They ask to see my student ID, which I give them, then the new guy who pointed the gun is SUPER embarrassed.   All in all a pretty positive experience, actually. I mean the gun thing was terrifying, but in retrospect, the image of the other police/solder running as fast as he could in full body armor yelling, ""international student"" is pretty hilarious...."

Overall I kind of trust the police to do a reasonable job in situations involving foreigners, because unless you get in a fight with some high up fuerdai, they will try to solve the problem diplomatically and calmly. I saw one policeman standing in the middle of two small crowds of country folk shouting and screaming and he had real authority. He could have easily taken them into some back room and beat the shite out of them but didn't. I lost my rag at the police in the visa office once and they were nothing but polite and forgiving.   That said, I've seen a group of 60-70 policemen arrive mob handed to demolish a neighbours house. It was a bit OTT. I saw a Harbin policeman beat the crap out of his wife on the street whilst in uniform. I actually had to jump in and stop him along with three other people. He was a big big boy.

After they determined that he had no idea what fake money looked like compared to real money they let him go. They even gave him a ride home.   Another time was at a bar when police showed up to settle a situation where a guy lost his phone and thought the bar staff had stolen it. The police arrived in a short amount of time and interviewed all involved parties. They were professional and even arranged follow up investigations.  A few months back my friends and I had a party at my friends apartment. Some of us decided to throw fireworks out the window from the 21st floor. We were playing loud music drinking a bit. A neighbor called the police and they both showed up. They kindly told us to stop with the fireworks and close the window because the noise was keeping others from sleeping.

China,3ca93k,TheDark1,3,Mon Jul 6 10:04:21 2015 UTC,"SINCE taking over as China’s leader in 2012, President Xi Jinping has shown an unusual preoccupation with challenges to the country’s security. A year later, to handle these, he set up a new national security commission and made himself chief of it. On July 1st the country’s parliament helped him further by adopting a new law on national security. It conveys the remarkable range of Mr Xi’s worries, with potential threats seen to be emanating from sources as diverse as the internet, culture, education and outer space. For its insight into the often opaque psychology of China’s elite, the bill will be welcomed—not so, however, by anyone with grievances against the Communist Party.  The law is a dense 6,900 characters of party-speak, with little in the way of detail (not even any specific punishments), but plenty of obligations such as to “defend the fundamental interests of the people” and take “all measures necessary” to protect the country. Many countries, including America and India, have laws on national security. But the variety of concerns covered in China’s is striking, as is the vagueness of its language (an exception is that April 15th will henceforth be observed as National Security Education Day). It may be followed by detailed regulations later. But it is unlikely that its key terms will ever be defined more precisely. To Mr Xi, vagueness is a useful weapon.    The law’s first article sets out the document’s intention: to “protect the political power of the people’s democratic dictatorship and the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics”. As always, the party’s grip on power and state security are treated as synonymous. Mr Xi’s role as national-security chief is primarily concerned with domestic threats. These include ones commonly regarded as national-security problems, such as terrorism. But they also include the challenges posed by free speech and liberal ideology.  Mr Xi has moved more decisively than his predecessor, Hu Jintao, to head off these perceived dangers, by rounding up numerous dissidents and tightening controls on the internet, as well as launching a “people’s war” on terror among Muslim Uighurs in the western region of Xinjiang. An important difference between an earlier draft of the law, released in April, and the final document is the greater prominence and space given to clauses related to the party’s monopoly on power. The bill (which replaces one passed in 1993) is one of five new laws currently in draft form or recently passed that may help Mr Xi strengthen the muscle of the security apparatus. The others are an anti-espionage law, passed last year, and laws currently in draft form on counter-terrorism, cyber-security and foreign NGOs.  The law makes a nod to one of Mr Xi’s pet causes, strengthening “rule of law”. Article 15 requires the state to “strengthen the mechanism for conducting checks on and oversight over the exercise of power”. That is not as it sounds. At an annual party meeting last October, Mr Xi set out a vision of the “rule of law” that clearly suggested it was to be used to keep the party in control, not to hamstring its power. On July 1st the legislature also declared that from next year, officials will have to swear loyalty to the constitution when taking office. That document supposedly protects freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly and of association. Yet its first article also specifies that China is a “people’s democratic dictatorship”. Mr Xi never seems to mention the nicer-sounding parts.  His anxieties have some justification. The party has long since lost its ideological legitimacy: the madness of the Maoist era from the 1950s to the 1970s put paid to that. Its economic legitimacy may also be waning: a slowing economy, rising prices and rising taxes make it harder to buy people off. Ordinary citizens are increasingly willing to express their grievances—protests involving thousands of people broke out in a suburb of Shanghai on June 22nd over rumours of a plan to build a chemical factory in the area, for example. The unrest lasted for several days until police began arresting dozens of participants. The rapid expulsion of air in recent days from the colossal bubble that is China’s stockmarket is also causing jitters in Beijing: millions of investors are people who have borrowed heavily to pour money into dodgy shares.  Under the new law, the duty of individual citizens to protect national security (for which read, not stir up trouble) is emphasised. This aspect is clearer than it was in the initial draft. Equivalent laws in most countries tell citizens what they must not do, such as leak state secrets. China’s law tells them what they are required to do, including reporting anything that may pose a threat. That is likely to add to anxiety among members of the country’s beleaguered community of political activists, who are already victims of vague legislation that has long been in force. In the southern city of Guangzhou, prosecutors are reportedly preparing a case against a blogger, Liang Qinhui, for “incitement to subvert state power”. His alleged crime was posting “sensitive” tweets. (One supposedly said he would “rather be an American dog than a Chinese pig”.)  Those alarmed by the new bill include foreign businesses. Some had already expressed concerns about the other security-related laws packaged with it, such as the draft counter-terrorism law, released in March, which demands that companies release encrypted data on request. The new law asserts China’s right to ensure that critical infrastructure and information systems are “secure and controllable”. Given China’s current anxieties about the use of foreign technology in computer systems it deems important, foreign firms worry that such innocent-sounding language could eventually result in stricter curbs on the use of their products. The draft law on foreign NGOs has similarly sown anxiety. It will require such organisations to register with the police.  There may be a little relief in Hong Kong. The document mentions the former colony’s obligation to uphold national security. But officials were quick to point out that the bill would not be applied in the territory, which has its own British-inspired legal system. Its exemption may not last forever. Chinese officials would like Hong Kong to pass its own law on national security; it says the territory is obliged to do so by its post-colonial constitution. But when Hong Kong’s government tried to pass such a law in 2003, massive demonstrations erupted that eventually caused the then chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, to step down. Officials in the territory are unlikely to be in a hurry to try again (notwithstanding an unusually low turnout on July 1st for an annual parade in Hong Kong by supporters of greater democracy; a movement that appears to have lost steam in the face of China’s intransigence).  Elsewhere in China, the chill being spread by Mr Xi’s new laws is unlikely to dissipate soon. A senior legislator told reporters after the latest one was passed that China’s national security was “more complicated than at any other time in history”. The state news agency, Xinhua, said all of the 155 legislators who voted on the law were in favour, apart from one who abstained. At least Mr Xi need not worry about the loyalty of his parliament."

If your visa runs out on the 30th, make sure you leave before the 30th.

ALL countries take visa's seriously, yours particularly so, so why did you overstay 26 hours?"

China,3c71qb,Aan2007,3,Mon Jul 6 00:51:09 2015 UTC,It's not a problem once you're through immigration. The issue is if things change before you're on international soil (ie. pre-immigration).
China,3c71qb,Kang_Xu,0,Mon Jul 6 07:15:56 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, delays aren't a problem. But if they change something in your intinerary beforehand and your flight now leaves past your visa date, that's a problem"

I had a flight like that a few years ago, flight out of one city on the day my visa expired, stopover in Beijing, flight left again after midnight.

China,3c71qb,Individual99991,4,Mon Jul 6 00:02:18 2015 UTC,A girl who works for E/E here in Beijing told me that they will compare your flight departure date with your visa end date. A flight that takes off the day after the end date (even if it's just a few hours) is considered overstaying and subject to penalty. They're doing this to get foreigners to leave plenty of room when booking flights out.
China,3c71qb,Intact,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:19:26 2015 UTC,"i don't think so, so if i have flight after midnight when my visa expires and i go through immigration before midnight they would give me fine for not breaking the law since my visa is still valid?   sorry i question your source unless you personally experienced this, because it would be most likely illegal to give someone for overstaying when he is not overstaying and leaving through immigration on time  it's always friend or friend and shit like this with people spreading misinformation"

China,3c71qb,johnny_blaze108,5,Mon Jul 6 03:05:20 2015 UTC,I was told specifically by chinese authorities at the airport that for each day you overstay it's a 500 yuan fine and partial days are counted as whole days. A girl trying to help me at exit/entry told me that a visa that expires before the flight leaves is an overstayed visa even if it's just by a few hours. They will check your departure date against your visa date. That's two different Chinese authorities at the airport that told me this.

Check to see what kind of visa you have before you do anything. If it's a 30-day visa, shift your plane flight up by one day.  Visas only allow you to attempt to enter the country. So you can attempt to enter it up to July 15. Your allotted period in the country will begin as soon as you pass through Chinese immigration/customs."

I asked around and was told about the 500rmb a day fine and figured it was a wash and decided to risk it. It was a non-issue but coincidentally as I was going though the immigration with about 4 other people in one of those black toyota minivans, we had just finished the Chinese portion and were starting to pull out to do the HK part and a loud siren or alarm started sounding, just as I was breathing a sigh of relief for not being hassled. The driver stopped momentarily and then continued on and there were no problems. A little funny as never before or since have I heard this alarm in dozens of times through, just the one time when I was sweating my overstay. No idea what it was sounded over."

I wasn't given a fine but I was given a police record after an investigation. Apparently I will be held in a cell for a week or two if I do it again.    The only thing that was a bit weird was that within a month after the event I was stopped twice during my typical commute by random Chinese people one who admitted being a cop who watched foreigners and another who claimed to be a professor.

As a former trader who still dabbles, my perspective was, if the market opened strong, and climbed consistently throughout the day on decent volume, we could have seen a mini-rally. However, it's been in a downtrend consistently from the open, which to me indicates that retail does not believe in this attempt to rally.   That being said, this market has been all sorts of unpredictable, so take anything I say with a grain of salt. If it closes in negative territory today though, even after this huge intervention, the odds of a sustained rally anytime soon are small."
China,3c99b5,thinkinguncritically,6,Mon Jul 6 03:57:05 2015 UTC,"Apparently both SH and SZ indices are up ~4% this morning, so I'd say it's definitely had an effect.  That being said, I assume that all those brokerages are being forced by the government to prop up share prices (why would they do it voluntarily?).

China,3c99b5,hydr0xide,7,Mon Jul 6 02:37:14 2015 UTC,"My gut feeling is that they are being forced to buy on the threat of fines, or that the government has given them all an explicit (albeit private) insurance policy against losses.   Either way, I can't see it ending well."

China,3c99b5,Cai_E,4,Mon Jul 6 03:44:38 2015 UTC,Would clever investors just start selling some of their shares of these companies that were forced to buy into the market?
China,3c99b5,redforeva,6,Mon Jul 6 02:59:33 2015 UTC,"yes, and those investors forced to buy into the market could just borrow shares from the broker to sell short, using their money as collateral. The shares are then in their name still legally so it looks all fair to the government, then they give back the borrowed shares at the lessened price and pocket the difference.  Thats kinda how Li Hejun did it with his solar company"

NK is an unpredictable liability, but China thinks that the cure is worse than the disease right now."
China,3cam4g,kamakie,4,Mon Jul 6 15:32:02 2015 UTC,"As far as anyone can tell, China is getting real tired of North Korea's shit, but they're kind of in a bind. First off, the collapse of the North Korean regime would be a disaster for China (and probably Korea too). Thousands, if not millions of N Korean refugees would flood across the Chinese border. That would also include a lot of party leadership demanding asylum.  The collapse would also likely lead to a unified Korean Peninsula, one with a large US military presence that is quite wary of China. It may even have favorable views towards Japan.   So China would lose an important buffer. The reunification would be very complicated, requiring costly reconstruction and delicate negotiations about what the resulting government would look like. The world would expect China to pitch in for a lot of this.  As for status quo, it's important to keep in mind that while China has a certain degree of influence over N Korea, they can't control it outright."
China,3cam4g,xiefeilaga,3,Mon Jul 6 12:45:56 2015 UTC,"China has stated repeatedly that unified Korea under South Korea(US) will never be accepted. I guess they fear that US military would never leave South but instead push equipment on their borders threatening the security of the state. Is the fear warranted, I don't know but that's basically their way of thinking in addition to the refugee situation that would appear if the regime would collapsed. They also have a treaty obligation to defend North Korea.  What comes to that link OP posted telling about the defector, Finnish government hasn't confirmed anything about that so it's just pure speculation, I like how the people at r/worldnews are already jumping to huge conclusions. A lot of news about North Korea are somehow editorialized or just outright false, like Sky news reporter said few days ago that Kim Jong Un fed his uncle to hungry dogs, that myth was debunked like a year ago and they still reported it. Crap like that gets reported in the media all the time, especially on the trashy tabloids."

The bathroom was cramped and stuffy, the kitchen small, floor boards warped, and windows only single pane (in northern China this is a BIG problem during the winter). It was furnished with decent, sturdy furniture (although not visually appealing). I was beside an outdoor kareoke bar where I was tormented with horrid, drunken singing at ungodly hours.   On a more positive note, it was only about $230 a month and across the street from the school I worked at; additionally the location was convenient for shopping and eating out. All things considered, I lived there for 2 years even though I could have moved elsewhere."

Marble floors, marble countertops, marble paneling a meter high throughout the apartment. Later I found out that marble tile is really common (in this area, anyway) but at the time, I'd never seen an apartment done like that. Other unusual things (from a middle-class American perspective) were the cages around the windows (for hanging laundry and preventing suicide) and the shower that wasn't separated from the rest of the bathroom. Also, of course, there was no built-in oven or stove. Other than that, though, it's a pretty standard two-bedroom apartment."

However, the ideology did emphasize male friendships, and Louis Crompton has argued that the 'closeness of the master-disciple bond it fostered may have subtly facilitated homosexuality'.""  Seems like a stretch to me. Lots of men have close male friends and there is never any homo-eroticism involved whatsoever."

Still, in terms of infrastructure and buildings, China is already pretty built up which is why those property tycoons like the Wanda guy are buying up overseas (he even admitted that there was nothing more to invest in in China)."
China,3c79tm,xuankun,7,Mon Jul 6 11:08:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think China will continue to grow so much anymore. The easy growth is certainly over and the country can't count on investment and exports anymore. But I don't think the CCP will collapse anytime soon. They're too strong and they have strengthened their control over society and information even more just in the last two years. The man in charge Xi Jinping thinks he can command and crack down on everything and force everyone to bend to his will, jailing opponents (journalists, rights lawyers, feminists, academics, protesters) left, right and center. Seriously, it's sad that the only solution the party uses to tackle social problems is to strengthen the party. Whether it's corruption gone out of control or Chinese tourists behaving badly, the party thinks crackdowns or national blacklists are the key.   China has a ton of social and environmental problems like air and water pollution, hukou reform, gender imbalance, urban-rural, coastal-interior divide, and if it wasnt able to deal with or pay enough attention to them during their economic boom, I'm not sure how good the authorities can deal with them now.   There're problems everywhere in the economy imports and exports, the property market, stock markets and infrastructure projects. But there'll still be some growth because there is a massive population that provides the largest consumer market in the world, people are industrious, and there are developments such as in tech, e-commerce and highspeed rail. It won't be enough, at least to sustain the 7% and up growth. Li Keqiang has said all the right words about focusing on quality instead of growth but the actions and policies, which are often inconsistent, the authorities take stil reflect an urgent need to keep growth up.  China also has a lot of areas to improve on too. I think a lot of things are mediocre like customer service, product quality, and how processes are carried out, like banking stuff.  However, the country won't fall apart. The people are able to cope with a lot of shit. The country didn't fall apart during the Cultural Revolution, despite trying its best to tear each other's throats out, nor after the Tiananmen tragedy. Whatever shit happens, the Chinese should be able to bear it even if they won't solve it.  My guess is the country will grow but at a much slower pace than before and it will see a gradual but definite slowdown. China won't be booming and rather than a roaring dragon, it'll be a sputtering, wheezing one. I foresee mediocre progress for China and that's not necessarily a bad thing for it."

China was used by the multi-national corporations because the CCP is the perfect partner in crime for the MNC's to destroy worker's rights and de-industrialize the West, whose people got uppity, sometimes striking, but finally failed to embrace fascism, so another form of control was needed. China was exploited with the complicity of the CCP, along with the destruction of the Chinese environment, in order to get production away from developed countries and move it around the 3rd world, as well as increase robotics and decrease jobs at the same time. Whatever happens to China now, I think you're right, they'll bare it and survive. They got enough wealth to improve their infrastructure and military, so that's probably all the CCP needs to stay in power, some increases in the standard of living and enough gun barrel power to prevent their overthrow.

The government should focus on improving social programs but I'm very skeptical.They weren't able to during the boom period in the 2000s, so they mightn't be able to do so now, especially since they are still obsessed with spending money on useless infrastructural projects and propping up the stock market.  China did do impressive things in infrastructure and basic literacy, but keep in mind it's easy for an authoritarian government to do those things. I still see it more as quantity rather than quality. They graduate millions of students from universities but a lot of those institutions and degrees are relatively worthless. They focused on exploiting cheap labor and manufacturing, then property and investment on infrastructure, and a lot of it was inefficient and overpriced.  Jiangsu and Zhejiang are pretty good places but they're still not that prosperous.

The 60k/month people I've heard of or know are independently-teaching workaholics (see my other comment here for details). But yeah, even that doesn't exceed the US tax-free threshold by that much.  Supposing it did matter, why is it even better if you live near HK? I have an American friend there who said the bank activity of Americans opening new bank accounts in HK will now be reported to the US or something."

I always took my money down to HK and put it in a HK bank, the benefit is not having having your money in a mainland bank with the wire transfer limits ect. I have no idea about US citizens."
China,3c6gd4,shoeboxliving,2,Sun Jul 5 09:24:21 2015 UTC,"It makes sense to have a day job as an easy source of students, but he doesn't really need it now that his client base is established.

Genuinely curious, I'm moving to Beijing to study Chinese for a year or so and I know several of my native Chinese friends teach kids english on the side and make a nice bit of money.  I like kids (babysat them for years) and teaching on the side doesn't sound too bad at the moment.    How naive am I being right now?"

Seems a bit unfair (I know, I sound like a whiner), during my undergrad most of my younger professors who studied in China were able to do it and I have quite a few Chinese friends who do it on the side for money.  Do you know if universities ever do any sort of programs for potential english teachers?  Also I've started looking at the various forums and message boards for the particular university I'm going to go to and it seems like loads of them do it on the side.  Is the crackdown a very new thing or are they all screwed by now?  Thanks again for the comment, I'm getting some support from my family while I'm out there but I don't want to be a burden to them.  (Also it kind of pisses me off that my Chinese friends doing grad school here in the US can make all sorts of money tutoring for Chinese and internships, why are the Chinese so uptight about laowai tutoring their kids or doing internships)."
China,3c6gd4,TheMediumPanda,2,Mon Jul 6 05:08:46 2015 UTC,"Just tutor privately, hell: get a cheap phone and a new wechat account and look around, or put up some posters, or get some Chinese person to find clients for you. It's not hard. You keep saying that your Chinese friends do it: it doesn't matter, they're Chinese, they don't need a visa. You sort of seem to be hinting that you're ethniclly Chinese, in which case: go nuts. Maybe, possibly. I doubt that anyone would even check your visa if you are ethnically Chinese, as long as your Chinese doesn't have a hateful foreign accent, they'll probably just assume that you're Chinese in that case. I don't know though, that is just speculation. I doubt you'd make much money in that case anyway. In terms of police giving a shit, it's getting worse: people used to do this shit for years and be fine, even in 1st tier cities. There is still space to do it though, you just can't be as brazen as people used to be."
China,3c6gd4,TheNatureBoy,4,Mon Jul 6 08:24:23 2015 UTC,"60k? I Think very, very few if any, make such a number. If you did, you could definitely go legit without much trouble. Taxation isn't too bad here, at least compared to Europe, so being legit isn't gonna cripple you. We pay 4% standard company tax on ALL income, no exceptions (at least I think it's around 4%, I'd have to ask our accountant) then you also have to pay personal income tax on the wage you pull which for me adds up to around 10%. So to get money in, go through the company and into my hands is gonna cost 15-16%. For that I don't have to constantly worry getting raided, I can advertise, I can rent openly and I'm not suddenly being charged with working illegally and tax evasion. The latter can easily land you 6 months in a Chinese jail btw."

That's all fine and dandy until the government stops by (as in, the people you haven't paid off) closing your 200 million investment down. Hainan Province is given special permission as a designated tourist area to build courses, so if you ever go there wondering why they have 150+ courses, that's why."

China,3c6gd4,TheNatureBoy,4,Sun Jul 5 15:11:18 2015 UTC,"Mission Hills and the other huge ones down there are legal and approved. The vast majority of illegals are real estate developers working huge areas and putting courses into the planning to attract buyers. They often get local permission in return for certain,, ahem, fees paid, but have to write ""sports grounds"" or ""recreational areas"" in the prospect, so that people have their backs free if/when the provincial inspectors stop by. Yup, if you pay premium dough for real estate overlooking a golf course, there's a real chance that it'll be shut down and possibly be demolished within a few years."

If you have the Z visa, a good relationship with your boss, and you don't do anything stupid and make the wrong enemies, you will never have a problem.  China has much bigger fish to fry than a foreigner who makes 50 or 60k per month.  Chinese teachers illegally doing zhongkao and gaokao cram classes make 50 or 60k per week.  They sometimes go after those teachers but usually just make an example of 1 or 2 every season while 99.99% of them carry on as usual.  Meanwhile, there are the people making black money that is genuinely harmful to the economy.  Policemen shaking down small businesses/racketeering.  Industrial polluters bribing regulators.  Developers bribing govt officials to kick farmers off of land, then bribing regulators to look the other way on safety regs, then flipping everything at 8888% profit and parking the proceeds offshore.  When it's all said and done, Joe Laoshi making a couple extra wan per month doing under the table classes is the least of China's issues."

And they do indeed keep boatloads of cash, at least from what I've seen in movies and news stories, haha.   Your answer explains why the government doesn't get suspicious if they see that, but what about banks? In China if you aren't on a visa that permits you to earn money, are you even allowed to open a bank account? If you are, will they let you deposit a livelihood's worth of RMB regularly while in China? If so, why is it allowed? For potential gifts from your Chinese sugar daddy or something?  Sorry to come back with more questions but I feel like it can't be that simple haha."

I know a school that dumps tons of money into the superficial things like carpeting, furniture, signage, etc. Yet the same school balks at simple, cheap things like textbooks and other materials that would vastly improve the learning environment. One of the teachers told me once that the owner of the school told him that teachers, both foreign and Chinese are of little importance to him, his ""consultants"" that sell the courses are his most valued employees. It's fucked, but at the same time he is not in it to provide a public service, but to make money. Too bad he does feel like both can be done."

China,3c6gd4,OttawaLitecoins,4,Sun Jul 5 08:06:18 2015 UTC,"I know you're joking but I think it's interesting so I'm gonna share some stories I've heard:  1) A friend of a friend works in a school on a business visa--that's nothing new. Let's assume it pays at least 10K. Then in the evenings after class, he runs small group English classes for kids out of an apartment for 125 per kid per hour. I don't know the details but if each class has 4-5 kids, six days a week 5-9 pm, his monthly income will be 60k+. Of course, he has to pay rent on the classroom apartment, and he also hired a Chinese assistant.  2) I've seen a couple of posts online from foreigners in suburby places where Chinese people who made their fortune in the big city buy homes to raise families in a more spacious environment. Being the only foreigner in a town full of wealthy Chinese families with young kids = ka-ching! They run tutoring or small classes all day in their apartment. It could take a long time to build up their client base but eventually, if it's an average of 350/hour, seven hours a day, six days a week, that's around 60k a month.  Of course, these take a lot of work and time to build and maintain, and it won't happen for a totally shitty teacher with zero people skills. I feel like I'd be bored out of my mind doing this kind of thing, but hey, lots of people are willing to sacrifice some happiness for money. Or maybe they actually like it."
China,3c6gd4,Hautamaki,3,Sun Jul 5 09:00:40 2015 UTC,"Seven teaching hours a day is insane. Doing it six days a week is even crazier. No one is doing that and if they are, it isn't possible to keep it up. Most people couldn't keep that up for more than a month or two."
China,3c6gd4,TheMediumPanda,2,Sun Jul 5 11:49:14 2015 UTC,"I know one older woman who does that, and one man who tried, but burnt out and cut back to 40-50 hrs/week, but they can't charge 125RMB per kid per hour, more like 65-90RMB/kid/1½ hours with 10-15 kids per class maximum seating capacity."
China,3c6gd4,Hautamaki,3,Sun Jul 5 12:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if the class sizes are bigger of course they can't charge that much. But then the net per hour is greater. It's also a lot more demanding though.  And yes, people can absolutely do 7 teaching hours independently. In a school or training center it'd be pretty insane, but when you don't have a school or boss keeping an eye on you, and you only teach one or a few students at a time, many classes can just be conversation practice and playing games. Requires almost no preparation. The vast majority of parents don't monitor their kids' tutoring sessions much at all, especially since most can't speak much English. As long as they hear you and the student(s) talking in English and they like you, you're all set. I'm not saying it's the best work ethic, since you could definitely be helping them more, but that's how it is possible."

China,3c6gd4,Hautamaki,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:52:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it would be easy, but it isn't that insane either. ""Easy"" is clearly not as prioritized as ""simple"" and ""efficient"" in these people's lives anyway. But many foreigners interact with non-native speakers all day and do fine--coworkers, girlfriends, friends, housemates, whatever. Of course, your students' English is probably lower level but it's still doable.   As I said, quality of education doesn't have to be a concern. People are pretty hungry for any chance to get a leg up on English and will not stop coming unless they dislike you personally, or the students hate you and don't talk in class.   But anyway, I am not even sure that that's how their schedules work--that was just a possible calculation. Perhaps it's five hours a day with four students per class or something.

China,3c6gd4,instagigated,3,Sun Jul 5 09:35:12 2015 UTC,"Oh I think you misunderstood. 60k RMB is their cash income in China, not post-tax income. So if they're Americans, they'd be paying taxes on $116k. But I don't think they pay taxes in the US either. I think they just make sure the amount they deposit in their US bank account stays below the threshold. In this case it's about ~$20k over the threshold. You could just split that among spending, keeping cash, keeping it in your Chinese bank account, having a family member take care of it, etc.  Actually in the case of this specific guy I know, I just remembered that his girlfriend is a foreigner not from America... so I bet she simplifies his life a lot!  But also, these people are certainly not the drunkard slob foreigners.

China,3c6gd4,TheMediumPanda,2,Sun Jul 5 11:13:11 2015 UTC,"My first few months I wondered this too. Its cause China has very little in terms of anti-money laundering. Its called KYC and AML, know your cusomter and anti money laundering. I've had a bank account closed in Canada for depositing 500-1500 CAD 2-5x a month. I wasn't a drug dealer, just bought and resold things for a ~10% profit. But in China no one gives a flying fuck. I've deposited 20,000 RMB and they didnt even bat an eye. In Canada they wouldn't asked me a billion questions about how I got the money and stored the transaction for the CRA (tax agency in Canada) and if they didnt believe me they'd freeze my account.  As for the people doing. I can give you an example with someone I know. Like Hautamaki he does a university job, 2.5 days a week. The rest of the time he does private students and runs a school with his wife and some Chinese investor. He works 6-7 days a week. I'm pretty sure he nets more than 30,000 RMB a month. He just sends it home via bank transfer via his wife and if its more than 50k USD probably just ask a Chinese friend. I've also told him about doing it via bitcoin but he hasnt tried that. The IRS has no idea if the money is legally obtained so he can just file his taxes normally. He won't be taxed under $98K USD I believe. His logic about getting caught seems to be ""I'm making a lot of money, if I get caught I'll just get deported"". He's just here to make money. Makes sense too. For the most part teaching English here is a dead end job.  And I know of someone else who is ""affiliated"" with a foreign government support office. She used to work on an F visa, now works on an M visa. Gets paid in a Chinese bank account so I'm pretty sure thats illegal too. Company isn't even registered."

Moving to the cities to work, even if to be treated as second-class citizens when they get there, has been the salvation of many rural young women, liberating them from parental pressures, bad marriages, overbearing mothers-in-law and other stresses of poor, rural life. Migrants have also distanced themselves from the easiest form of rural suicide, swallowing pesticides, the chosen method in nearly 60% of rural cases, and often done impulsively. The reduction in toxicity of pesticides has helped as well.   I am going to get on my soapbox again. Fuck this country's view on family. It is nothing short of pure misery for everyone involved.    Why buy a flat? To get married! Why get married? To make a kid! Why have a kid? For the family!   Now 2 people who have nothing to do with each other has to raise a shithead together.

Historically, in places experiencing high levels of stress, suicide rates can drop despite dire circumstances.  So for example, Britain in WW2 had a drop in suicide rates during the war and, in places experiencing famine, suicide rates are also low.   So it could be that things are turning to shit at some level (the air and water is polluted and consumerism is becoming problematic) which is causing the declining suicide rate."

Is that the reason why?"

Astrill software is excellent, the speedtest tool helps a lot to find good servers to use.  Personally, I don't mind paying a bundle to Astrill, they rarely let me down.  If you switch, make sure to do a trial run only for 1 to 3 months.

China,3c6jn2,imoninternet,4,Sun Jul 5 08:54:20 2015 UTC,Mainland China was in most ways closed to the world through the 1970s. A domestic music scene that was anything more than the schlock played on CCTV's New Year's show did not exist until the mid 80s. Cui Jian was the first well known rocker. There were no audiences for disco or funk

And they gave me a supplementary card for my wife too.  When I once went over the limit they actually bumped it up to 170k for a while automatically.

China,3c6jaj,Sasselhoff,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:08:56 2015 UTC,"Almost impossible. Honestly, the best way is through connections. I was able to get a credit card thanks to a Chinese friend who works for one of the major banks.

China,3c6xmr,investandr,5,Sun Jul 5 21:17:51 2015 UTC,"As Greece holds a referendum that may create more uncertainties than it solves, are we looking in the wrong place for a financial crisis? In China, the authorities are in a fine sweat about a more traditional financial conundrum: a bubble in the stock market. How do you deflate it safely? Should you even try?  As with many things in China, the numbers are staggering. The two main indices – the Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Composite – had risen about 150% in the 12 months to mid-June. In terms of market value, that was a gain of about $6.5tn. Since then, the market has tumbled almost 30% – call it a $2tn plunge.  What’s the big deal? Shares never go up in a straight line and anybody who bought a year ago has still more than doubled their money. But there are several potential problems, at least to Beijing’s apparent way of thinking.  First, there are a lot of latecomers to the share frenzy. In May, just before prices started to fall, 12 million trading accounts were opened.  Second, some latecomers are novices ill-equipped to take losses. Trading on margin – using borrowed money – is commonplace in China, raising the likelihood that losing investors will be forced to get out in a hurry, creating more selling pressure.  Third, a crash in the share market could hit the real economy. Consumer confidence could be damaged. More directly, companies could find it hard to raise capital and the gradual liberalisation of the Chinese economy could stall as locals and foreigners conclude it is safer to stay away.  Such worries explain why the authorities seem so keen to put a floor under share prices. Interest rates have been cut and margin requirements have been relaxed, seemingly to help investors with their backs to the wall. Banks have been told they can hold less capital with the central bank, freeing up liquidity in the financial system. So far, nothing has worked.  On Friday, operations took a new direction. The securities regulator said it would look for “clues of illegal manipulation across markets”. In other words, short-sellers and devious individuals are being blamed – a traditional excuse for authorities who like there to be a culprit. Maybe more measures will follow if the market continues to fall. Already, voices can be heard calling for direct intervention – in other words, the state buying shares.  The Chinese do things differently, but these measures seem a ridiculous over-reaction. If the authorities feel compelled to intervene every time the stock market rises 150% then corrects by 30%, they are creating massive problems for the future. Investors will believe it really is true that the share prices are “officially sanctioned”. Instead of assessing companies’ prospects intelligently, investors will try to guess the intentions of the bigwigs in Beijing. You can’t liberalise an economy that way; you just create the risk of an even bigger bubble next time.  Even if one accepted the dubious proposition that emergency measures could be justified to prevent damage to the wider economy, the authorities acted far too soon. The interest rate cut came after a 20% fall from the mid-June highs. That was a mere slip in the context of the market’s rise. No wonder investors were not reassured. Beijing was sending a message that it is setting interest rates for the stock market rather than the economy. What happened to famous Chinese long-termism?  The only certain way to deal with a stock market bubble is let prices fall to the point where they are cheap. At 20 times earnings, the Chinese market is not an obvious bargain even after these declines. The deeper worry is this: if the Chinese authorities think a wobble in the stock market is a threat to financial stability, do they have the ammunition to cope with a proper crisis in the more important property market?

And in espionage having personal info is part of the package. IF, China is indeed behind the OPM hack(its all allegations at the moment) not having personal info is stupid. That is the exact point of aggressive espionage. Their personal history, who they have fucked, are they addicts or have mental illness, all this matters.    If you can't get that, then you don't get how espionage works.    There are various kinds of espionage, one where raw/technical data is enough and China has done that aplenty from the time they stole the source code to Wind Turbines from an Austrian Lab to having real personal level data so that the information can be leveraged for other purposes.    Just like Intelligence has various components like SIGINT, GEOINT, OSINT(the type West often uses against China when direct sources are not available or to corroborate) and then there is HUMINT.

They're personal and no one needs to know, especially if there is something embarrassing or something that can be used against you at some point.   Financial data doesn't matter because your financial situation is always changing. However your medical record is permanent in a different way.   No one needs to be able to find out about your abortion, or yearly STD tests, or anything else."
China,3c5h5b,malariasucks,3,Sun Jul 5 06:07:00 2015 UTC,What about physicians when you switch hospitals or end up in an emergency room?  Isn't portability important?  Or being able to provide life-saving information quickly when the need arises?  Plus I don't really buy the idea that financial records are any less embarassing.  What happens when your debit card statement reports your monthly phychiatry appointments and child support payments?  Your credit history showing a foreclosure and bankruptcy?  Your credit card showing trips to the porn shop and marijuana clinic?  I can't think of anything inherently more private about medical data over financial data.  Privacy for both is important.  But portability is only critical for one.

China,3c68yt,impossinator,3,Sun Jul 5 10:21:11 2015 UTC,Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of this.  So 1.7 trillion yuan is about 300 billion dollars.  At the height of the boom Shanghai and Shenzhen together were worth 10 trillion dollars with Shanghai index at around 5000.  30% fall since then puts them at 7 trillion dollars and Shanghai index at about 3500.  The aim is to get the Shanghai index back up to 4500 which would need about 2 trillion dollars or 12 trillion yuan.  If the support is going to raise the index to 4500 then isn't everyone just going to wait for it to reach that price and then sell en mass?  I mean it's unlikely to go higher than that point so why not just sell and take the money.  But if everyone sells then 1.7 trillion yuan just isn't going to be enough? It's not going to be anywhere near enough to pay everyone off?  Right?

China,3c5tjx,malariasucks,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:19:10 2015 UTC,Usually the pollution is bad in the winter. The winter was unusually warm this year. I didn't even need to buy a proper winter coat despite people telling me how frigid Beijing can be. That might have had something to do with the improved air.
China,3c5tjx,burtsbees656,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:22:54 2015 UTC,it was the same in Shenzhen. Last year we had two really bad cold spells and this year I didn't use half of my winter clothes

It was chilly, but I wore a uniqlo peacoat with minor insulation most of the winter. I was really glad not to have to buy a real jacket at the time. Everyone said ""just wait, it will get colder."" Not so much. I was down in Shenzhen in December and didn't even wear my jacket out."
China,3c5tjx,burtsbees656,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:55:46 2015 UTC,ya and the year before I was wearing long johns to work. I think I wore my winter jacket here once as opposed to 30-40 times the year before
China,3c5tjx,malariasucks,0,Sun Jul 5 05:08:15 2015 UTC,"I believe 2014 was an especially bad year for pollution. As far as I can tell 2012, 2013, and so far in 2015, the pollution was still awful, just not quite as bad as last year. If the government is doing something (regulating and moving factories away from Beijing) it will be interesting to see if they continue as the economy gets weaker. Likely any change is related to weather patterns and not government policy. As long as Beijing is a mega city, it will always be polluted because of it's geography."
China,3c5tjx,burtsbees656,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:27:58 2015 UTC,Wasn't 2012 the year of the Smogocalypse?
China,3c5tjx,Individual99991,0,Sun Jul 5 04:17:31 2015 UTC,"Every year is a smog apocalypse in Beijing. Usually that stuff gets coined when we get a week of 400+ AQI and everyone notices this place is not a great place to live again.   The longer you live in Beijing, the more you just accept the awful air as a fact of life. It is easy to let your guard down.  At 150 AQI its only a slight haze. And its always different because it depends on what else is floating around. Sand, construction dust, car exhaust. Some days the sky is yellow. Some days it actually looks blue. If it is at night, you don't care as much because you can't really see it. It's kind of funny seeing people so concerned about masking up on their commute to work, but as soon as they want to go out for a drink they forget the air is still hurting them.   On the rare occasion that it actually looks like the end of the world (probably 4-5 weeks a year)  everyone freaks out and and the media drops some phrase about it. The reality is, those 150-200 days are probably much worse for you. They occur 50-60% of the time and you don't always think to wear a mask since that is your normal.   I check the pollution everyday on my phone and I have never seen a day where Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Xian are all clean at once. Also, I think its interesting that people in HK believe that they just have fog and not pollution. They are just across the water from two of the biggest manufacturing cities in the world."

China,3c450v,songtree,14,Sat Jul 4 16:24:38 2015 UTC,"No need to bring water, it's sold on board. A couple of large bottles should be fine.  Essentials:   Portable battery pack to charge your stuff if the sockets are broken/disabled/permanently in use. Hand sanitizer. For when the hand soap runs out, if there was any in the first place. Hand towel. Slippers. So you don't have to keep taking your shoes on and off. Be prepared for extreme heat if there is no aircon or if it's turned off, or extreme cold if it gets cranked up at night. Cup to make coffee/tea with from the hot water provided in each carriage. I like to bring oatmeal for breakfast also and eat it from the same cup. Metal spoon and chopsticks are a must also.   Other tips:   Your phone will die super-quick from switching towers constantly. Put it on airplane mode unless you are stopped at stations to conserve battery life. If you have the bottom bunk don't let other people turn it into a communal seat. It's yours. Same goes for selfish people who will want to monopolize the table and floorspace, smoke and be noisy. Give an inch and they'll take a mile. You said you are bringing food, bring more than you think you'll need. Processed meats are good, as are hardy veges like cucumbers and carrots. Cheese, hardboiled eggs, yoghurt, trail mix and/or granola bars are good too. If you don't have a seat, you can always try to buy a sleeper berth once you're on board. Ask the carriage attendants. I wouldn't wish a three day train in a hard seat on my worst enemy.   Where are you going that takes three days? Slow train to Urumqi?"

China,3c450v,rockyrainy,3,Sat Jul 4 18:30:49 2015 UTC,"I am not aware of any direct trains between Kunming and Urumqi. Did you book 3 separate tickets?    The segment between Kunming and Chengdu is exceptionally scenic also horrendously slow. The train follows the DaDu river gorge for the most part. It is actually better to take the bus on G5 over the train (12hr instead of 20hr). Chengdu to Baoji is also one of my personal favorite. The mountain pass right on Qinling is pretty awe inspiring. Lanzhou to Urumqi is a lot of desert. The valleys immediately west of Baoji is quite nice.   If you are taking the long way via Zhengzhou then it is a bit less interesting.  Tips:   If at some point on the jourey you need a bed to lie down. Go to the condustor station on carrage number 8. And show him your ticket and say boo piao, ying wo to upgrade into a hard sleeper. If for whatever reason you are absolutely sick of staying inside the train breathing nong feet fumes and have to get off the train. Chengdu, Lanzhou, Wuwei, Jiuquan/Jiayuguan are good places to get off.    Hope to see some pictures when you finish the journey. Good Luck!"

China,3c450v,Aan2007,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:55:31 2015 UTC,"Adding to the above poster:  Toilet paper is a must.  Some sweet snack foods to balance out the salty meals they serve in the dining carriage (or the instant noodles).   Cheese is not very good, since it tends to sweat. Same with cured meats like salami.  Definitely a blanket or warm coat might be an idea if you're worried about aircon being up too high.   The slippers thing is only really relevant for bunks, but the territory thing is true even for seats. When you get up to eat or pee, people with standing tickets may take your seat. Take it back without hesitation on your return.   Get some exercise during the day exploring the carriages. Go to the dining car even just for a break from your seat, and more space (the seats on the train are cramped).  Earplugs can be a godsend."

China,3c450v,Pomguo,3,Sat Jul 4 16:48:43 2015 UTC,"You're going to need to destroy your consciousness. Alcohol might do here and there, but for three days in a seat on a Chinese train, you'll need something that reaches deep into the synaptic gaps of your brain and yanks your ganglia like a rigorous tug job from a migrant farm woman. Which you'll be seeing a lot of.  Ether would probably be easiest and most effective. It'll put you right out for a while, and when you come to your mind won't know it; your body might do stuff, but it won't register with the scorekeeper upstairs, so you'll feel like it doesn't count. I bet you could order the shit straight off taobao, but if not some guy at a hospital will probably sell you a small jar.  You could go for the classics: opium is still out there, and heroin is supposedly back in a big way. I don't personally recommend any intravenous usage (I should state that I do not condone or encourage the use of any illicit substances), but there are other ways. Consult the skinniest, sleepiest looking half-stooped dude you see on KTV street in your city. Alternatively, you can process your own low grade opium by visiting a Chinese colleague's rural village and visiting grandma's garden. She grows some for cooking. Keeps the kids coming back for visits.  There's a veritable galaxy of pseudo-legal substances being pumped out by Chinese chemical factories and sent to the wastrels of the West specifically designed to be one molecular bond ahead of the drug schedule. You can gamble with some of that shit. Hell, you could probably write reviews for your own affiliate marketing site and get a commission from Jack Ma himself for every bulk shipment. Not my cup of ayahuasca, though.  You're going to Xinjiang, so it is safe to say there will be dudes with hash on board your train. You will know them from their skullcaps, facial scars, and hands in your backpack. Befriend them and they will smoke you out for sure. Any paranoia you experience during your high will be entirely reasonable and extremely well-founded.  I'm told there's plenty of meth being slung around China, but that shit's nowhere near my purview. And good luck finding any coke. You can probably get your hands on some decent MDMA, but you will be kicked off the train for inappropriate touches if you go that route.  LSD or entheogenic mushrooms nets you a mixed risk; the authorities don't know to look or test for them, but if you experience anything other than the kind of trip where you stare out the window for hours while your brain fills in the scenery with alternate interplanetary histories and divine symbolism, people will know something's up. Especially if you begin trying to speak with them in Chinese. They'll know.   There are rumors of a new drug out there called axolotl, reportedly synthesized from a type of parasitic fungus that forces ants to commit suicide. I don't know where you can get it outside of a small town in Zhejiang called Chihuaizhen. What I've heard is that it's this real mystical, chakra-aligning, kundalini-awakening shit that bends your subjective experience of the universe back into itself, so that you simultaneously experience being both the passenger and the train, the track, and the baijiu bottle cap that's been poking into your thigh since you got on board. Someone who someone I know knows knows someone who tried the stuff and they're now an extremely successful life coach for horses.   Then there's always nicotine."

The plane itself is then a much less comfortable ride.  Whereas the train I just turn up shortly before it leaves, and then I have a bed and plenty of space to wander around and socialise. I can get food at much more flexible times, which is nicer and has a wider variety of choices, and it gives me time to catch up on my reading, on TV shows and games, and just to stare out of the window and keep my own company for a while (kind of a rare thing in these busy times!).

They're constantly interrupted with going to the next stage of boarding, and you can't snooze past them without risking missing your flight.  The hours on the train are yours. You can have a really long lie-in in the morning with no repurcussions, you can stay up late reading that book you're really into or beating one more boss on your laptop or portable, etc etc.   Obviously there's a point where it gets too much - all things in moderation. But a single day trip where I'm likely to spend most of it catching up on sleep anyway?

China,3c2rsc,ByronicAsian,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:00:39 2015 UTC,"Well the Soviets overran most of Manchuria is <1 month, I'd say that's pretty successful. During this campaign, one or two successful Japanese delay actions is hardly surprising wouldn't you say?"
China,3c2rsc,Hanfresco,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:07:21 2015 UTC,"Considering the  lack of effective antitank weapons and lack of air superiority, I find his statement of a single Japanese infantry company (whose small arms and heavy equipment ""loadout"" so to say are inferior to its Russian counterpart) being able to delay a whole Russian ""regiment"" 10x its size to be rather incredulous."
China,3c2rsc,ByronicAsian,-7,Sun Jul 5 11:46:05 2015 UTC,"lol  I remember reading somewhere about how a handful of japanese managed to put a serious hurt on a bunch of ""invincible"" US marines at a place called 'tarawa' - to the point that the American public were crying like proverbial little french girls"
China,3c2rsc,PerNihilAdNihil,13,Sat Jul 4 15:26:54 2015 UTC,"So, the fact that the Japanese managed to hold out for 3 days in one position in which they were defending an island against an amphibious assault demonstrates that they are, what exactly?  Better than US soldiers?  The US still took the island from them in 3 days and had 1,696 killed and 2,101 wounded.  The Japanese had 4,690 killed in the same battle.  Also, if you look at the military history, the campaign in the Pacific was basically one huge US/allied victory after about 1943.  Sure the Japanese had some temporary victories, especially at the beginning.  Its war, you won't win every battle, but the US won all of the important battles and eventually the war.  The fact that you managed to dig up one example where the Japanese had a hugely superior defensive position and managed to hold out against a US invasion for a whopping 3 days doesn't mean jack shit.  The Japanese suffered triple the deaths that the US forces did and they still lost the island.  They went on to lose the rest of the war, badly, to the US/allies too.  Post-war, their country was predominantly rebuilt and re-shaped primarily by the US, as well.  The fact that you found one battle in which the American public was a upset about the loss of life of their soldiers does not mean that the American public was ""crying like little girls.""  Its obvious that you have a hate boner for the US by the way you seem to take so much joy in their suffering.  You should probably pick an example of an actual Japanese victory instead of a loss if you want to act like a prick though."

China,3c2rsc,nikatnight,18,Sat Jul 4 10:44:42 2015 UTC,KMT fought them and consistently lost.   The war was not entirely one-sided as you seem to imply.
China,3c2rsc,Hanfresco,11,Sat Jul 4 12:04:19 2015 UTC,"The CCP barely did anything, guerrilla style or otherwise.  In fact, they even leaked intel on KMT positions to the Japanese.  They saw the Japanese as undefeatable by Chinese forces; their goal was to use the Japanese to destroy as much of the KMT for them as possible while waiting for USSR to come and liberate China, then hand China over to the CCP.  This more or less is what happened, except that the US insisted upon the KMT and CCP forming a government together.  The KMT, with American support, finished the war in much better shape than the CCP had hoped, and were in good position to wipe out the CCP, but the Americans forbade it and refused to lend the KMT any help even in transporting their troops north.  As a result, the CCP had a critical extra three months to receive additional arms and training from the Red Army.  When the KMT finally got their troops in position to attack, they outnumbered the CCP by over 10 to 1, but winter was coming on and the CCP was able to retreat all the way to Harbin and even across into Russian territory before finally mounting their counter attack and smashing the over-extended and exhausted KMT army.  There is also evidence that at least 3 of the KMT army's generals or someone in their staff were CCP double agents, as the three main KMT armies continually stupidly marched into ambushes and did other militarily illogical actions, leading to their eventual defeat despite having an overwhelming advantage in numbers at the beginning."
China,3c2rsc,Hautamaki,4,Sat Jul 4 14:20:17 2015 UTC,I've seen you mention the leaking Intel thing many times before. You got a source for that? Just curious.
China,3c2rsc,xuankun,4,Sat Jul 4 15:02:40 2015 UTC,"It's from cables that were declassified in Russia in the 90's that Jung Chang dug up for her book Mao: The Untold Story.  The USSR ended up telling the CCP to cut it out because they were more concerned about the Japanese actually defeating the KMT before they finished up in Europe.  They wanted an easy conquest of China so their interest was in a weaker Japanese Imperial Army.  The Chinese communists of course didn't care how hard the Russians had to fight to beat the Japanese; their interest was in a weaker KMT for when they were fighting their civil war.  So the CCP, and Mao in particular, was trying to shift more of the burden onto the Red Army by helping the Japanese weaken the KMT, while at the same time Stalin was trying to do same thing in reverse by keeping the KMT strong so their conquest of the Japanese would be easier.  Even in these days, Mao and Stalin were very much frenemies and neither trusted the other farther than they could throw them.  Both with very good reason of course."
China,3c2rsc,Hautamaki,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:40:50 2015 UTC,"If what you are saying is true, then why did Russia do nothing until Japan's defeat was locked down by the Americans?  Why is there no effort by Russia to fight Japan?"
China,3c2rsc,LuckyLiang,0,Sat Jul 4 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"Russia was supporting the KMT the whole time, while also doing 80% of the fighting in Europe, then they immediately rushed east and destroyed Japan's largest army in the largest battles of the pacific theatre.  What more do you want?  No effort?  That's a crock; Russia contributed about 40% to the defeat of the Japanese and 80% to the Germans.  Who told you they made no effort to defeat the Japanese?  The Americans won the naval and air war against Japan, but the Russians inflicted more military casualties on Japan in a month than America had in 3 years."
China,3c2rsc,Hautamaki,-5,Sat Jul 4 16:45:44 2015 UTC,the KMT fought itself and the communists more than it fought the japanese  oh and the Formosans. the KMT did manage to acquit itself tolerably well against a bunch of civilians when its corrupt leaders wanted to set up shop as moguls.  the coloring book versions of the cold war histories usually leave this one out though

China,3c2rsc,kanada_kid,5,Sat Jul 4 07:58:21 2015 UTC,"The Japanese never stood a chance at the very beginning. We knew it, and they knew it. In fact, the IJN said quite clearly that they could hold on & out for just a year, anything beyond that would just be dumb luck and something miraculous. They had certainly outdone that goal.   Things really took a down turn for the Japanese after Midway. Both sides did things by the books but the Japanese bungled up a little, and American fleet capitalized fully on that almost marginal error... that and an excellent job done by the Naval intelligence.   The submarines managed to be a huge pain in Japan's butt and they were so expert at being the pain that it actually bought America precious, precious time to rebuild & re-assemble her fleet. But those carriers and battleships were definitely sunk by USN flyboys."

In effect the KMT soldiers were nothing more than Chiang's scarecrows.   The CCP's efforts were hampered by Mao's insistence that they not show their strength to Chiang, lest he take advantage of their weakness and attack them. One of his generals disobeyed him and committed 100 divisions to aid the KMT in what is now known as the 100 regiment offensive.   The CCP spent most of the war doing guerilla warfare and biding their time."

China,3c2rsc,skullblasta,2,Sun Jul 5 04:30:43 2015 UTC,God dammit. Can I  please finally get an authoritative response on this:  Who fought and defeated the Japanese in China and forced them to withdraw? Was it the KMT? Was it the Commies? Was it the USA or the USSR? Was a it combination?  Mostly I want to know because I see so many TV shows of Chinese communists killing Japanese.
China,3c2rsc,Volesco,5,Sun Jul 5 14:22:16 2015 UTC,"In China specifically? The KMT fought the Japanese to a draw and tied them down for 8 years, but it was the USSR that finally destroyed the Japanese army occupying northern China (also the most powerful and prestigious of all the Japanese field armies).  However, in 1945 most of the Japanese forces in China simply laid down their arms and surrendered to Chinese forces, as ordered by Emperor Hirohito in his surrender broadcast. This was made possible by the naval campaign waged by the US for the last 4 years, as the US was the only one of the four powers able to actually bring the fight to the Japanese home islands.  Make no mistake, it was the US that defeated Japan and forced the Japanese to retreat from China. However, it was the KMT that stopped Japan from conquering all of China, and it was the USSR that liberated much of China and prevented any possible Japanese holdouts in the north.  To address your question about the communists, the CCP is easily the least responsible for Japan's defeat. Their actions against Japan were mostly limited to small guerrilla actions, and they prioritized the weakening of the KMT over the defeat of Japan."
China,3c2rsc,JillyPolla,5,Sat Jul 4 23:59:40 2015 UTC,The Kwantung Army at that time was a shell of its former self. The important resources had already been transferred to the various fronts and it was basically war hardened Soviets against peace keepers.

Because of the void left by the Cultural Revolution and because all the scholars, intellectuals and old wealth families were slaughtered, they have no upper class model to identify with, all their references come from lower classes folks who originate from this peasant culture. If you are around rich Chinese nowadays, you will quickly realize that their lifestyle, habits, beliefs and cultural references are not so different from that or your average Mainlander, they only have more impact (in good or bad) because of their power and money. Of course there are good people out here, a friend of mine has too much time and money on his hands, he does charities in poor rural areas and does not earn a penny from it, these are few and far between, surrounded by hordes of arrogant tuhao."

Also, if they had a green card but stayed out of the country, the green card would be revoked.  I guess if they had a passport it would work, but they'd have to spend serious time in the US and give up their Chinese passport (China would demand proof that they are not citizens before renewing the Chinese passport)."

Secondly, as thinkinguncritically mentions, this amount is a drop in the bucket and cannot make a meaningful impact on the market.   Thirdly, and most importantly, China's market is now crashing in the face of repeated policy changes and manipulations from Beijing, and perhaps Beijing thinks that they can manipulate the market back into positive territory, but more likely each time they intervene it makes them seem more and more desperate which may be actually weakening confidence.   The only smart play for Beijing now is to let the market collapse and reach a position where the stock value reflects real value, but obviously that option is too risky for them.

The irony is that I am Chinese.   No other RoTK games made by Chinese companies even came close.   When you think about games and animes made by Japan and are loved by a lot of people all over the world, Japan didn't really have an agenda. It wasn't a top down approach to win the world through soft power. Instead, like Hollywood in US, it was a bottom up approach, creative and industrious minds that are globally competitive as a result of a true free market economy. They are tested and retested in their own market, forced to compete against each other and against other countries, forced to go bankrupt,  and forced to try again in  vicious circles of ruthless capitalism with no help from above.

That doesn't mean there aren't brilliant, creative and visionary directors and artists in China (despite the brain-melting schooling system), just that they don't have access to big buckets of money/guanxi, and that those that do get those opportunities won't even bother going that route anyway, because it's literally never going to pay off. (Plus, yes, creative people who don't pursue a career in film because they need to get a house so they can be married by 30 because their parents blah blah Confucian bullshit.)  Doesn't help that - as with almost all big businesses in China - the film studios are mostly run by older dudes who happened to see a niche and have the money to muscle their way in, rather than creative people who love the medium and happen to have been successful at it. So the dudes running wannabe Chinese Pixar aren't trained writers and directors themselves, but people with money and guanxi and a vague idea that this kind of thing makes money, somehow, and they want that money so... something something merchandise profit.  Breaking up state control of the media will do a lot to help this state of affairs."
China,3c2j6e,xiefeilaga,5,Sat Jul 4 08:52:11 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to disagree. I know a lot of independent film people, and even some mid-level directors, writers and producers. The industry is brimming with talent, but mainly hampered by two things: the party's insistence on micromanaging everything, and the glut of investors with zero knowledge of the industry. Of course, it's much more complex than that, but the problem isn't lack of talent. I've seen some amazing scripts and concepts that would probably do well in both China and the rest of the world, but simply can't get made because of how the industry works.   Likewise, you may think that animation doesn't get censored, but there is still a lot of ideological pressure to hone the ""right spirit"" in China's children. Meanwhile, the outsize presence of CCTV (which favors the crap from its own studios, and sets ridiculously low market rates that are followed by the rest of the industry), and the IP problem (impossible to make any money off merchandising), mean it just doesn't make sense to sit down and craft a great series.  I agree that the education system is geared to stamp out creativity, but there are a lot of incredibly talented and creative people in China who would shake things up if given the chance."
China,3c2j6e,TheMediumPanda,4,Sat Jul 4 09:22:08 2015 UTC,"I often think there has got to be a million great stories out there. Black jails, extorted migrant workers, Shanghai triads, corrupt real estate developers, shadow banking, the pitfalls of guanxi, rat meat factories, FG in China, greedy officials, sex trafficking and many more. Most of which would be denied production or heavily edited/censored."
China,3c2j6e,xiefeilaga,6,Sat Jul 4 10:02:52 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of great stories to be told within that forbidden territory. The Bo Xilai saga would make an amazing TV series. But you can even do a lot of great stuff without crossing that line.   The problem is that censorship often goes way beyond forbidden topics, and reflects octogenarian paternalism. Many scripts are rejected by censors simply for being deemed too complicated for the masses to understand. It's also frowned-upon to blur the lines between good and bad. You actually run the risk of having your script rejected simply for writing a deeply flawed hero, or a bad guy who thinks he's doing the right thing.  Then you have the distribution system. In film it's controlled by just a handful of companies, most of which have their own production interests to protect, and are also expected to carry out the party's propaganda goals (see Avatar being pulled early to make way for that awful Confucius movie). A movie can be fully approved at both the script and final cut level by censors, only to be rejected by distributors because ""we've had enough silly comedies this year."""

China,3c2j6e,impossinator,10,Sat Jul 4 09:39:20 2015 UTC,"First, I don't see much hope with such an authoritarian government in power. No authoritarian country can hope to win over the world when it has no attractive values or qualities to promote.  Take censorship. Right now all movies, tv shows and books, as well as magazines, are reviewed and censored by the government before being allowed to be shown or published. This means a lot of edginess and social issues must be scrubbed clean and erased.   Chinese history and culture has some value, but it's overdone and sanitized so that it seems really artificial and joyless. Take the Olympics opening ceremonies for Beijing and London. One featured impressive scenes of thousands of drummers and dancers against an imposing background, the other featured the ""Queen"" frolicking with Mr. Bean and James Bond that was kind of silly. But which one seemed more enjoyable, which one seemed distant and very ancient?  This brings up the point that for Chinese culture to be viable as soft power overseas, it needs to actually be practiced by Chinese. How many Chinese do kungfu, taichi or play Chinese instruments? Even people in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore don't really do that. Compare it to say karate and taikwondo which are widely practiced, respectively, by Japanese and Koreans. I live in Beijing and several of my female Chinese colleagues do yoga, as do many young Chinese women. I'm pretty sure few do taichi."
China,3c2j6e,TheMediumPanda,6,Sat Jul 4 04:59:12 2015 UTC,"What you described is soft power through cultural means, which is near non existent in China. For there to be any cultural soft power, China needs to solve its own internal culture conflict.   As for economic soft power, it helps that the largest companies are state controlled. This gives them the ability to do things like build the African Union Headquarters or dominate the solar energy market. Chinese companies also tend to favour market share over profit, even if they have to operate on margins or at loss. This is a sure, but costly way to gain reputation"

This is a sure, but costly way to gain reputation   Only if that market share is gained based on the reputation of the quality of the product.  A buying decision based on solely price or the simple unavailability of any better alternatives is not one with any real brand loyalty behind it, and therefore 'market share' gained in this way is, if not illusory, then at least very tenuous."

On the other hand, the true soft power of the West is propaganda, making all kinds of negative stories about other countries."

I cannot emphasise this enough.  The CCP is a bloodsucking, ossified gaggle of sociopathic rent seeking nepotists, cruising on the vapours of street cred left over from the Long March.  Put them out to pasture. End the media/internet censorship and insane inanity of suppressive coercion designed to enforce 'harmony', 'purity' and all such nonsense.   Lose the butthurt and the snotty attitude about the West and Japan -- seriously, nobody in the rest of the world fucking cares that your feelings were hurt for 200 years.  Grow up by shutting up.  You are the cause of your own problems, today.  Realize that, face up to it, and move forward.    Slow down the bloody rush to 'catch up with' and surpass everything and everyone.  The desire to 'prove' how virile the 'Chinese Nation' is is sophomoric and is causing you to compromise on things like integrity, justice, originality, and it's making people tune you out unless there's money involved.   Let Tibet, Taiwan, and Turkestan forge their own goddamned destinies without the threat of military force hanging over their heads.

That means a lot of movies, TV shows and music that serve only to brainwash and placate the people of that country. Which inevitably does little to impress those in other countries. (Deliberate attempts at soft power generally fail because frankly those in charge have no fucking idea what foreigners may want, and Chinese state office culture means that those who do know will be too low down the pecking order to make any change to what is produced).  Mainland China does have a bunch of talented writers, directors and musicians, but even if they somehow become popular abroad (despite not having the financial backing and distribution connections of bigger, state-approved operations), they will be known as being popular despite the control of the mainland (at best) and counter to the control of the mainland (at worst).

US is seen as having soft-power yet it kills innocent women and children.    Korea had their K-Power phase, did it allow them to somehow shape the world or Asia, they were insanely popular, even as far as parts of India. There wasn't even economic benefit to Korea from all this beyond the BO.    Smaller countries and their people gravitate to bigger and economically powerful countries.    THAT is all that is real and it doesn't matter if that country is authoritarian, as long as it is accommodating its fine.    But for those who like to keep up with this sort of antiquated concepts.

China doesn't force Hollywood to do anything and still they have given up on making anything critical of China. Heck there aren't even Sharon Stone like rants anymore.    I expect some actor having a  rant on this in few years at the Academy Awards and the subsequent derailment of their career.   China will be taking East Asian astronauts into space, this is a huge huge thing, it sets up behind the scene strategic cooperation, not just a public PR exercise.

Soft power is about the aspiration of people outside your country to be more like you, to have the life you have. Nobody outside of China aspires to be ruled by a government of autocratic elite, and nobody is aspiring to the Chinese way of life - sanitized of free ideas, entertainment and political speech.  Korea's soft power only continues to grow over the years, making it a popular partner for people around Asia who might never even meet a Korean in person.

And China is not even close to how the Soviets were. This sub is filled with people who couldn't cut it in the West or willingly chose to work in China. China is neither Soviet or Japan. Its a mercantile nation just like many other. It does business and gets rich like others and THAT is what leads to concepts like Soft Power.   Soviets sent India's first person into Space and this almost every child even today in India knowns. This is part of the reason why Russia has such great public support in India, it was a multitude of things but this helps as well.    And as i said, this is not just a PR thing, this leads to behind the scene strategic alignment.   Pew charts keep changing.

Maybe they're just shitting bricks because of how badly this whole mess in China could turn out.  The purpose of reports like this is to be constructive about ways to improve a financial system but at the same time one of the broader aims of the world bank is to keep the international system functioning.  Spooking markets with criticism like this may therefore not be the best thing to do at this time.  More interesting from the FT is this video http://video.ft.com/4336491144001/Greece-risk-pales-against-China/Markets Which talks a bit about short selling and how it's necessary for effective market functioning.  The Shanghai composite is still up 70% this year and there are a lot of people who are still way up in profits.  The government needs these people to hold steady and sit on their investments.  In an efficient market these people would have the option of shorting a small amount so as to offset any future loses.  If they can't do this due to witch huntery and patriotism then there's no way to hedge against further drops in the market and so they are better off just completely selling now so they can lock in profits.    It's possible, this is what the video suggests, that by going after short sellers the government is actually, to some extent, making the sell off worse."

The economy needs to reform and it is clear the octogenarians in CCP fear what that could mean for their stranglehold on power, because they're doing all they can to continue the status quo and manipulate the system. While it is true that their stock market has increased by 70% YTD, the numbers don't make sense when looking at the market cap, (decreased) profits or revenues of most of these companies that have seen their share values go through the roof. Be that as it may, the CCP has made this their last stand to pump up cash and made the mistake of thinking they could control the stock market, not taking into consideration consumer confidence. They're doing all they can to push nationalistic propaganda supporting the buying and holding of stocks and yet you still hear people saying that this is a CCP rigged game to rob the laobaixing blind and fill the coffers of the party and their wealthy plutocrat friends. There is far too much vitriol about the stock market from the party to convey a sense that they have a strong, confident hold on the situation.  Now, I'm not saying I know the future by any sense, but my money is on the CCP's power corroding internally due to losing control of the economy as people's livelihoods are slowly affected (jobs lost, money lost in stocks, value in housing lost, etc.), while losing influence externally because they won't have the excess capital to throw at other countries and they really have very little cache in terms of soft power without money.

This means they are not stretched and that allows them to work and focus more thoroughly on these issues. This is part of the reason the leadership or the Party are going nowhere.     Secondly the Party is irrelevant in the China-Story-Context. Party exists in the shape and form they do because the Chinese people are like that. Anyone who takes over after the Party will continue  on the same global trajectory. China having democracy or not in that context is irrelevant.    Democracy doesn't mean China will be more reserved. It can in fact even mean the opposite, hence the debate on that is futile.   Global Hegemony has a simple path formula. Establish regional hegemony and don't allow anyone else to disturb that situation. Next, act as a disrupter in the others regional hegemony of around the world. One doesn't even have to be a active hegemon at that distant place then.

Statements like ""use of government power when it is not necessary is itself an affront to freedom"" are deeply ideological  products of a particularly american way of thinking. Plenty of liberal democracies around the world use government power to protect freedom in ways the US might view as 'not necessary'. And most of those countries are the ones that rank higher than the US on human rights and freedom indices - Scandanavia, Western Europe, Aus/NZ, etc.  This seems like just another one of those articles by radical free-market ideologues who think US-style capitalism is the answer to all the world's problems, despite all the evidence from the US and the rest of the world that this is not the case."

Having to give up my passport to check into a hotel or buy a SIM card. Very strange. The hostility of language in China was jarring for me as well.

I did see a guy rack his weights afterward, which isn't all bad, but I mentioned it to one of the trainers and he said he couldn't say anything to them because then they'd be pissed off about being told what to do and the gym might lose money."

What I saw was a bunch of really fit, muscular young guys taking their workout seriously, taking turns on machines and using proper form and just doing what would be considered normal gym activity.  Then, you had people just fucking around on the machines, putting on way too much weight and then using full-body jerking motions, just atrocious form, to lift the weight and then just letting go so the stack would just CLANG to rest.  They'd do like three reps and then just sit there occupying the space for like thirty seconds and then do three more reps, continuing to use the back-injury-in-waiting kind of jerky movements.  Then, you have middle-aged fat dudes (like me) who are kind of serious about working out but only work on their vanity muscles, like chest, arms, and shoulders.    There are lots of staff and personal trainers, but they just sort of stand around not doing much.  They are very friendly, though, and offer advice when prodded, but they're mostly there to look good in tight clothes and sell memberships to the looky-loos who wander in to check out the place.  That's kind of how they got me.    I saw a lot of phones being used, like by women on the recumbent exercise bikes, but you know, that's normal.  I use my old phone as an mp3 player, and there's free wifi."

I would even say I feel better now that at the beginning cause I made some pretty close friend and my mandarin is much better now ( speaking it open a whole new world ).But maybe you are right I'm in the honeymoon phase still, I know some people that have been there longer but are just waiting to go home, however I have the impression they did not enjoy china in the first place."

I mean, sure, the good things might outweigh the negative for you (they do for me) but I don't know how, after living here for three years, you can read this person's complaints and ask ""have you ever step a foot in China?""  Also by honeymoon phase I don't mean ""still wanting to live here"" - I mean being (wilfully or otherwise) oblivious to the negative aspects of living in China compared to a developed country."

And the best forums, by far, are the mods who let whatever content in and allow anything posted - aside from spam.  r/china fits in that category. I appreciate this laissez faire approach to modding, whereas most mods take this shit way too seriously.  Let the users self-moderate themselves. reddit even has a voting system to help with that."

RChina is a completely different kind of sub though, for me it's about shooting the shit about life in China and maybe keeping on top of the news - a kind of sub best with low levels of moderation. I don't really give a shit about the most consistently upvoted content, generic holiday pics.  Rchina's problem is it represents different things to different people but the rchina community isn't big enough to survive balkanisation into a large number of focused subs, which had been tried. I do think r/japan's r/japanlife seems like a successful addition though.  Mods can set the tone of a sub by consistently deleting certain points of view, thereby driving away the elements in the community amenable to those positions, but not by being active on the sub themselves or taking a laissez faire approach.  I think the sub could benefit from encouraging use of tags like the 'serious' tag and stricter moderation forcing adherence to those tags in those threads only. This seems like a good  compromise position which can let people share this space more equitably."

China,3bym40,squaredrooted,5,Sat Jul 4 00:52:53 2015 UTC,"The true disgustingness of the Fuerdai   I actually really agree with this, especially in regards to some of these kids who end up in the States. As a resident of SoCal, I see many of these kids driving around in extravagant cars and spending with literally no limits. Land at LAX, drive over to Beverly Hills Maserati, drop your cash, and drive home in your new car.  Monthly living expenses? Far more than the average household income in the US (51.9k median income in 2013, ~4.3k per month).   How its actually NOT very cheap at all.   This point I might disagree with, to an extent. If you convert to USD or whatever home currency you use, you might find prices here very cheap, depending on what you buy.  For example, I consider taxis far cheaper than anything possible in the States. Yeah, the numeric value will be high (70 RMB taxi trip in Beijing), but that totals to just a bit over 10 USD. To me, that's cheap. To a citizen, that's probably not something they'll do often.  But for other things, yes, it might not be cheap. It depends on what you look at.

I don't think it really existed for my parents generation or my grandparents generation. And it's been a growing thing for China. I dunno the going prices of drinks (cocktails, shots, etc) here in China, but I feel like it'd be far more expensive than at home just because it's a ""Western"" thing and still relatively new.

Yeah, it's crowded near Confucius's grave, but outside that? There's an optional cart people can take that drives on the main road. What does this mean? EVERY CHINESE PERSON WILL CHOOSE THIS OPTION SINCE IT MEANS THEY DON'T HAVE TO WALK. WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE THE ENTIRETY OF CONFUCIUS FOREST TO YOURSELF (aside from them occassionally whizzing past you).  And the forest is massive, you can spend hours walking. If you wander off the main road, there are some dirt trails you can follow that still have graves everywhere. It's really cool getting lost and then coming across a grave with statues.

So for 150 RMB you get to visit 3 places (originally the tickets are sold separately, but since it is a poor city so they decided to combine them so they can charge more).  First one is confucious temple, it's used to hold ceremonies and they have mock ceremony shows everyday. The best thing about the place is the trees in the yard, many are hundreds years old and they are priceless.  The second place is confucius house(?), it's where his descendents live (I think). Outside the exit there is a exhibition of stone carvings from different dynasties, and it's free.  The third place is confucious ""forest"", which is a graveyard of sorts. Confucious's descendents are buried there. There is a temple there to memorize Confucious but the Stone tab was smashed into many pieces during the Cultural Revolution, it's pieced together now by nails and rope.  Outside the Confucious ""Forest"" it's a long road sided with shops but the shop owners are poor people. Not much business going on there. Some offer scallion wrapped in pancakes (煎餅捲大葱), some offers archery (1 RMB for one arrow or something like that).  If you venture outside that road it's like you left the city."

China,3byi2u,mister_klik,13,Fri Jul 3 05:56:13 2015 UTC,As far as I can determine from the various commentaries I have read - mostly from other sites - this new law gives the government far reaching powers to both determine what is a threat to state security and take more direct action to eliminate that threat in a timely manner.  For example: if you post a dickpic online the government can now send someone round to your house to remove and impound the offending member pending an inquiry which will examine whether it is offensive to the State's organ.

Although in practice I don't think the law will affect you. Airing certain grievances to a limited audience is allowed, even for Chinese, as long as it does not entice other Chinese to take any sort of action. The party knows that humans love to whine and moan and that this keeps them happy - just as long as nobody acts upon it.  The law probably doesn't mean there will suddenly be a wave of arrests and purgings, but it certainly makes it easier for the authorities to find an excuse to put ""troublesome"" people away with even less difficulty. If they could arrest those feminism protestors for 1 month, they will now have a much easier time putting them away for longer, for the sake of ""harmony"" (aka. no fuzz = everyone shuts up and does as told).  I think it will pretty much work in the spirit of Mao ""punish 1, educate thousands"". And now the punishment can be just so much more severe and the lesson so much more memorable."

This is just a catch-all law, carefully crafted so as to be able to be interpreted to cover just about anything, and the Western media loves to talk about Chinese internet controls/cybersecurity right now. In any case, there are already plenty of these type of incredibly broad laws on the books they can use if they want to get troublesome people out of the way.

If you care, I'm sure you'll find certain Himalayan tribes still consider it acceptable to consume human flesh. It's all about how low you are willing to go.    I mean if they abnegated Chinese culture completely, they would never have achieved that.    Look at the bigger picture. That's not Chinese culture, that's American culture, where diversity trumps over every single individual culture, where Africans are free to be African & Chinese are free to be Chinese, at a relatively low cost. All young Engineers working at my company are highly trained and very, very intelligent yet very much underpaid. Why? Because there are just too many engineers, There is an over-supply in the job market, all thanks to a wonderful Confucian tradition. At the same time, there are not enough visionary designers, skilled salesmen, able market-promoters, creative ad-campaign managers, so on so forth. In America, the society is a healthy,  pyramid shaped structure, in China, it is almost cylinder shaped.   Also, there is no denying that the Chinese make up disproportionately America's academic world, also disproportionate was the number of them becoming star entrepreneurs of high-tech firms or Nobel laureates— there are, proportionately speaking, too few. Why? Because Chinese culture emphasizes orthodoxy and tradition and tend to cast a very negative light on what it deems to be deviance, something what we Americans call creativity. Quite often it is the case that only after a young Chinese came to the US did he flourish in his realm of study. That's why all the Chinese that ever won Nobel prize in Science and Engineering are all non-Chinese nationals, a fact in its own right speaks volumes about how pernicious Chinese culture is."

Ethnic Chinese. Look who tops the list, ethnic Chinese. So I don't think their culture is detrimental. A culture which does not place emphasis on education, but rather swag, street cred etc are detrimental to society.   I think you just have a superiority complex. I used to get that too. I felt very bitter when a population I considered inferior seemed to be outdoing ""my people"". I would constantly fault find and nitpick their achievements. But then I realised I was being petty and should stop seeing myself as superior / others as inferior.   Oh here's something else you might find interesting.

Chinese also listen to Chinese music (from China) as well. Those tend to be more soppy love songs though.    Chinese (and other Asians) are creative when immersed in Western culture.

Within a month Chinese benchmark CSI 300 has dropped almost 29% after gaining more than 150% since last June.  The impact of this fall could be heavily felt since huge speculative bets and margin lending make retail customers extremely vulnerable to loss.  This week stands as fourth worst week in a decade. Index have plunged 12.1% this week. Among the other three, one was last month when index dropped -13.32% and other two was during 2008 financial crisis.  China's another benchmark, Shenzhen index dropped -16.16% to close the week, which is worst since 1996 when the index had dropped -28.5%.  Volatility has also reached extreme levels. 5 day average of realized volatility has reached 7.3%.

Then I sent him a message to let him know it was done, a few hours later, after he realized that he fucked up, he got back to me saying that this was the wrong account, I should transfer another RMB1000 to the new account number (account B) that he gave me. I told him both accounts belong to the management company, they can transfer it themselves from account A to account B, he came up with some BS excuse like the money is not in account A or I need the receipt from the ATM. Well anyway I refused to pay twice for his mistake. The agent had the balls to threaten me to cut the electricity and water. I asked my local friend to come with me to the garden's management office. I gave them the receipt proving that I transferred the money into account A, and they immediately transferred it into account B. Basically the agent didn't want anyone at the management company to know that he fucked up, so he tried to put all the responsibility on me instead. What a scumbag."

If you have a feel-good story about China, post it, it will do well and your karma will soar. Same goes for photos, stories, and pretty much any original content.  Anyway, like others have pointed out, this sub is often negative about China because China is a developing country with lots of problems and a government that treats its own people like shit. Our survey showed that while most people like China, most of us hate the government. As for /r/Vietnam, just because their government is also communist in name doesn't mean that it is equivalent.

Everyone is busy kanshu-ing and shuijiao-ing, ripping off everyone in their business circle, or fucking up whatever meaningless job they've been assigned at some anonymous hotpot franchise. Add the censorship on top of all that and you see there's not much room for any creativity or stuff that is actually fun. In Korea and Japan you actually get the sense that people wish to have fun and play around, while in China it's all about making money.

The best thing to do is go straight to your local exit entry bureau and get this info straight from the horse's mouth, since rules either vary or are interpreted differently from place to place, and recent changes mean much of the information around the interwebs may be out of date.

China,3bz2jy,TheDark1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:11:10 2015 UTC,"Hi. First of all, thank you for your reply, I appreciate every feedback.  Basically, the situation is this: I just came back from the local exit entry bureau, and the officer in question said that because of the visa type change (Z-> Q1) I have to leave the country.  Before I received my Z visa, I was here on a study visa for a year as well (X if I recall), and back then I had to leave the country as well.  Furthermore - I was just informed that even after receiving my Q1, I would not be allowed to work (even with a potential job offer and renewed foreign experts license in place). So I probably have to end up getting another Z visa all over again. After three years of smoothly working here with little to no problems, having to jump through these legal hoops which leave little room for resolve and in my current situation (basically having to support a newly started family) this comes off as particularly troubling.  I just hope that I am indeed eligible for a Chinese green card next year and that this would finally allow me to take up work on my own.  Sorry for the rant. :("

Honesty is simply doing one’s best, while consideration means treating others with a considerate attitude   Da fuck it is. Who are these new Confucianist pricks anyway? Never in my near-20 years of sporadic study of Chinese culture did I encounter anything close to that in a far-fetched manner. The Confucianism absolutely believes the barbaric and backward ""3 codes and 5 values"", namely ""君為臣綱，父為子綱，夫為妻綱"" and ""仁、义、礼、智、信"", (source) all of which inspired Japan's Bushido — something served as the main cause for all the atrocities that committed  by the Japanese soldiers during the WW2, Like never surrender for the sake of (忠) and beheading British POWs by the side of the road (so much for the fucking (恕)).   Besides, this is what (忠) actually means: mindless zombie-like loyalty."

It's no secret that the Chinese government has been wanting to move more manufacturing activities inland. In their view, it's a chicken or the egg issue: Do you wait for companies to move inland before building infrastructure? Or do you take a build it and they'll come approach? I think China's position is in the latter, particularly emboldened by Shanghai's success with its Pudong district.  It'll take a while, but eventually the empty cities will start to get filled one way or another. Companies will actually move there or property prices will crash to a level low enough for these places to be affordable. That is, assuming that decay hasn't set in by then."

The 'best' kindergarten near us is a public one and to get enrolled there you need guanxi and a 30k bribe.   Our solution was to find a private kindergarten and pay.... nothing but the normal school fees. No bribes, no bs.

Again, there were definitely kids enrolled who did not fit this description and I remember researching the ""law"" at the time which had recently changed from only select schools being able to enroll foreign nationals to all schools being open to foreign nationals.

China,3byhgs,Aan2007,2,Fri Jul 3 12:42:10 2015 UTC,"How old is your kid? If he/she is born to at least one Chinese national in China, then the government considers him/her a Chinese national, with all the rights of any other Chinese kid. Hukou doesn't matter until gao zhong I think? For your kid to be considered foreign, you need to leave the country + get the new visa but also formally renounce his/her Chinese citizenship. I've been there, the Chinese embassy wouldn't let me get my son a Chinese visa in the UK, because they recognize him as a Chinese citizen.   Once yor kid does have full foreign nationality and a visa, then I think there's an obligation for the state to educate your child up to gao zhong, but bear in mind guanxi and bribes are a norm for many decent schools. You either pay the bribe, go private or enroll at the shit school down the road."

China,3byhgs,westiseast,2,Fri Jul 3 15:11:18 2015 UTC,"That's what we thought, and did. We knew there was a step where you formally renounce citizenship, but we figured it wasn't necessary. When we got to the Chinese embassy in the UK they wouldn't issue him a visa because they said he is a Chinese citizen, and giving him a visa in his UK passport would negate that. Maybe it was just this one guy, maybe its policy, we don't know. Either way, we ended up with a two year 旅行证 which is like a passport, but not quite. When he left china we used that, when he arrived in foreign country X, we whip out the UK passport. Confusing and weird, but it works. I'd just be careful, we lost two days and almost couldn't return to China because of this."

China,3byhgs,westiseast,2,Sat Jul 4 00:26:53 2015 UTC,"hehe yeah, fubar. In my case, China considers my son Chinese. They don't consider him dual. He has an English passport but the gov doesn't see that document as valid. They didn't want to issue him a visa in the UK passport because then that's equivalent to saying ""we recognize this foreign documents validity, your son isn't a Chinese citizen any more"".   As I said, I don't know if it was one pain in the ass embassy official or if this is standard procedure. In the end it has worked out OK because he has two working travel documents (Chinese and UK) and we don't need to arrange visas for him in China.   If you absolutely want a foreign citizenship now for your child, you might have to go through the steps of formally renouncing his/her citizenship before they will let you get that Chinese visa."

Like this gem:   Haute (Not Hot) Cuisine | 8 p.m.  Sichuan food may be known for its heat, but the cuisine is actually more complex than that. At Yu Zhi Lan, a tiny restaurant with three private rooms run by the affable chef Lan Guijun, every course in the kaiseki-like meal presents a unique balance of flavors, from the spicy-sour sea cucumber to the delicate sweetness of the bird’s nest with snow pears, peach tree sap and a bit of sugar candy. Lan’s goal is to elevate Sichuan cooking by combining a Japanese-style precision with fresh, locally sourced ingredients: He makes noodles with duck eggs from a free-range farm, for example, and slices them thread-thin by hand with a giant cleaver. Even the pottery used to serve each course was handmade by the chef. The set menu for two, with 10 cold appetizers and nine mains, starts at 600 renminbi per person.

China,3bvava,Smirth,5,Thu Jul 2 16:45:45 2015 UTC,"Good writeup of margin trading in China.   At first glance, margin trading appears has some very strict eligibility and operational requirements in China. But then, reading one of your links (http://www.ecns.cn/business/2015/07-02/171510.shtml) brings up this.   ""The revised rules said brokerages that had more-than-permitted margin trading could maintain the current level but forbade further increase.  Individual investors that possess less than 500,000 yuan (around 82,000 U.S. dollars) of securities assets, a threshold for margin trading, were also given the nod to continue their business, according to the amendment.""  So basically there were rules but companies didn't follow them and the authorities are now saying it's alright, go ahead with whatever you were doing. That's hilarious how the authorities not only openly admitted there are investors being allowed to trade without having the minimum amount of assets but decided to give them ""the nod to continue."" This isn't surprising in the least because that's how things are in China. There are rules but everyone tries to skirt them as best as they could and the authorities allow it but clamp down from time to time.  Also, the 500,000RMB minimum seems like a high threshold. This means that only well off people can invest and those kind of people usually can afford to bear some losses. Though I suppose if people actually had 500,000RMB, why would they need to do margin trading in the first place since you could trade just with that 500,000RMB and make some good profits.  But this being China, it's not actually enforced as another article you put up stated. https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/3bqovg/nonsensationalist_explanation_of_the_chinese/cspmhh6  ""But in 2013 the CSRC lowered the account-opening requirement to six months and said it was cancelling “window guidance” on the minimum value of account holdings. Brokers interpreted this change to mean they were now permitted to set their own requirements. Actual limits ranged from Rmb2m to zero. On Friday the CSRC reiterated the minimum Rmb500,000 threshold.""  The bottom of that article said CSRC had cracked down on some firms for breaking the rules, which is not surprising, but now with the relaxation of rules, those firms will go back to doing what they were doing before.  So investors are being allowed to do margin trading with assets below the minimum threshold or even 0, then it means all kinds of folks are involved in this including the less educated, less well off and ignorant investors.  Frankly, I'm not surprised the brokers are telling the CSRC to fuck off as you said and as the market declines (or maybe it'll go up and everything will be OK) those brokers will become more desperate to limit margin trading losses."

Also do you think JRJ has a conflict of interest as they're one of the biggest brokerages and are vested in calming nerves and getting trading commission up?
