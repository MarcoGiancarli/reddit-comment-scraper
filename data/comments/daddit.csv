Stuff some throw pillows and blankets under the couch to make an air tight seal, a heavy blanket for the door, and a big box fan to pressurize the whole thing. It's big enough for adults to sit up in and my 3yo to stand in, and easily fits her cousins and her when they come over (5 kids). Best part is, when the kids left the toy room wasn't a mess because they were so busy playing Fort.  Next step I want to go to goodwill and get 4 kingsized sheets and sew them together to make a monster fort out of the whole room!"
daddit,3e3mso,Dom3030,4,Tue Jul 21 18:30:16 2015 UTC,Epic! I made a fort out of our table and sofas a few days ago but it ended up being pretty damn hot in there

I asked the manager on duty if they had one, and he said there is one in the women's room and that my wife could change him there.   I told him that she wasn't with me and he needed to be changed and he pretty much told me that I was out of luck.     So I did the only other thing I could and proceeded to change him right on the table.  I was asked by others why I was doing that there and told them that the Men's room has no changing table and I wasn't allowed to change him in the women's room which had one and they did not offer me any other choice.   I could see the manager fuming while I was doing it, but he said nothing to me.  I later asked for the owner's contact information when I was ready to leave and he was appalled by the behavior of the manger.  A week later they had a changing table placed in the men's room, and I received some nice coupons for a few free meals as well as a written apology from the owner (he was a single father and didn't realize that location did not have the changing tables) and notified me that the manager had been replaced.

From developmental milestones to illness to tantrums.  There is always going to be something that catches you off guard and despite your best efforts to research and compare your situation to others (and even your own previous ones) you're still going to have a relatively unique experience.  In my case when my wife was pregnant with our first her water broke, but she wasn't sure because it wasn't a lot of fluid. We went in and they got her set up in a room. Things were moving slowly so they tried to induce her with oxytocin.  The baby started have a negative reaction to it (nothing serious) so they took her off and with in hours she had delivered.  Has that situation happened to anyone else? Probably, but nobody that I knew told me about it.  No matter how much you plan, prepare, and predict what will happen you will constantly be surprised.

Doctors are great at adapting to the situation at hand, that's really their job. They know a lot of the possibilities (obviously not all, they are just human) and can do what's necessary.

It was great. Played video games, house stayed clean, better food.   After a week I wanted to call him but didn't want to make him home sick.  He called one time and wanted to come home. Grandma packed his bag and the car but he reused to put on pants. So he stayed 2 more weeks.   Towards the end I almost put on Paw patrol just for back ground noise"

I recommend taking a slow bike ride enjoying the sights, making stopps to look at the traffic or whatever you find interesting. If you like cooking that's nice too without any pressure besides your own stomach growling. When shopping for ingredients it's nice to just go and browse through the store slowly taking your time.  Basically enjoying the small things of not being pressured for time. I play a lot of video games but games usually are ways of wasting your time. I'd say that's not what you should aim for primarily if you want to be able to fully appreciate the abundance of time."

Maybe the reason why the dump truck got stuck in the first place was because the toad wanted to teach him a lesson, and test Little Blue."

You do want to sit next to each other and in case your son cries at least whomever is next to you can at least lean to the window to save their sanity.   When traveling with an infant, you can bring bottled water through security.  We prefilled ziplock snack bags with formula measured out for a bottle so all we had to do was to pour the right amount of water in the bottle and then either tear/cut the corner of the bag and pour the formula into the bottle easily.   Pretty much carry on anything that will help soothe your kiddo and isn't bulky.  Make sure you have the baby's blanket with since planes can get cold and it will help keep him warm and help soothe him and maybe get a nap out of it.  I would rather use my own blanket instead of whatever airlines offer you as I don't trust them to be completely clean.   We were lucky on our first airplane trip we took him on when he was 8 months old and he passed out during takeoff and slept for most of the flight there and back.  The 2nd one, it was just my wife and it was right before he turned 2 and she had a huge nightmare with him freaking out because of the sounds of the plane and screamed for most of both trips.

The Google drive app keeps all the photos and folders synced online. It's always best to have an off site storage in case of theft or fire or other devastating loss. Google Drive is very cost effective for that. Plus then all your photos are available over the internet to other devices. Folder and photos can also be shared to friends and family.

Right now baby is less than 2 weeks old, so I've just dumped all her photos into the same folder, but as we do more focused activities, that may change. Or I might start using the ""collections"" feature of Lightroom and still dump all baby photos to the same folder each month.  Additionally, when I import into Lightroom, I have it automatically rename the files with the date. I'm eventually going to have another IMG0435.dng, but I'll never have another 20150720-IMG0434.dng. It's a bit of insurance for the future.   For exporting to Facebook and emails to grandma, I have it automatically rename as ""date time title"". I'm only selectively exporting, so any exports get a title tag. For example, a file of her silly hairstyle taken on July 20 at 6:35pm will be named ""20150720 1835 buttcut.jpg"". Just makes it easy to quickly scan chronologically through a much smaller selection than my master catalogue. All of this is automatic, even resizing to 2048px and saving in the baby Facebook folder, with a Lightroom export preset.  I'm kid of behind the times with Picassa and the like.

daddit,3dznb3,altillythebum,3,Mon Jul 20 20:45:42 2015 UTC,"Short answer - there is no easy way.     Medium answer - here are the tips I gathered in my struggles  1) My daughter's best friend - she loves to please adults and is very obedient (not like my child).  They potty trained her by allowing her to pick out her underwear (Dora and Princess), anytime she has a mistake she has to wear plain underwear for the rest of the day.  She's only had 2 mistakes in the last 6 months.  2) My former boss - his sons were difficult to train.  The final straw to get them to stop peeing and pooping their pants was to make them clean them off.  Hand the soiled underwear to the boy who did it and have him scrub off the feces.  They were 3.5 or 4 at the time and disgusted by it.  No more accidents after the 2nd time of cleaning their own crap.  3) Good friend and his twin boys - they bribed them, piece of candy for every successful potty trip.  Took about 3 months after they started this tactic.     Long answer - Ours started around 2 or 2 1/4, but mostly as a delaying tactic for bedtime.  She would pee and poo on the potty no problem, as long as it was right before bedtime or naptime.  Any other time of day and she would just let it flow - eating dinner at the table?  pee time.  Picking out her dress for the day?  pee time.  Sitting on the couch reading a book?  pee time.  Eventually, we gave up and put her back in diapers as #2 was about to show up and we didn't want to put in all the extra effort when she wasn't going to assist.  Now, she's 3 1/4 and #2 was born in April.  She went backwards for a few months after #2 was born and would only go in the diaper.  I took a week off 2 weeks ago with the purpose of potty training.  We told her they don't make diapers in her size anymore and she was going to have to wear underwear.  It's been pretty smooth, only a couple of accidents and she freaked out about them (which is good)."

Crappy way to remember to get the life insurance thing figured out."

She was totally fine, barely noticed...except that her dad was FREAKING OUT. Fortunately she got over a minute or two later that while I was lying on the bed, face down, sobbing, waiting for my wife to get off the phone with our very patient pediatrician (did I mention it was 2 AM?). Only reason I slept that night was pure emotional exhaustion.  Now I knock her around all over the place and think nothing of it. Actually, I still get pretty worked up when she takes a particularly hard fall or slams into something but it gets easier and easier as you realize that human beings only exist because our kids are pretty darn resilient.

daddit,3dzc4g,Get_Head_Ed,3,Mon Jul 20 19:26:17 2015 UTC,"First off, it's going to be really tough, and I feel your pain.  We are currently potty training our two year old for two reasons:  he's showing interest (he already pees on the potty for fun), and we are expecting our second next month.    What we're doing is the three-day method found on my wife's mommy boards.  We stay at home for three days straight, no going on excursions with the little one.  We bought 20 pairs of underwear.  He was really excited to wear the undies.  Then you tank him up all day on fluids.  Every 15 minutes all-day we say ""Do you need to potty?  Please tell us if you need to go pee pee.""    There will be a lot of accidents and a lot of false positives (where he says 'yes' to needing to go, then once on the toilet, he jumps right off).  But he's starting to get it.  We are on the third day and we have fewer accidents. He still gets his diaper when he sleeps.    Now pooping is a different story.  He tells us when he needs to poop, but he has a really hard time performing.  He is also shy about pooping.  When he drops a dookie in his underpants, we don't make a big scene, but we rush him to the toilet.  Hopefully he has a dingleberry, that drops into the toilet when his cheeks hit the can and we praise him like crazy.  Then he gets to pick a ""potty treasure"" from a box.  These are cheap toys from the dollar store.  If no dingleberrys, we take his dookie and drop it in the toilet and say, ""next time if you can make poo poo in the potty, you can have a potty treasure.""  I've been told the first three days are the toughest, and it can take two weeks.  The most important thing is to not shame him and to be consistent.  Only positive reinforcement at this point.  If the experience is too negative, he may stop communicating about potty time and then you're really screwed.  For your situation, I think you need to introduce rewards, a toy, or a treat like a single m&m.  That will get him really excited to go pee."
daddit,3dzc4g,pixelrebel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:56:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I guess my wife and I are just going tough it out.   We tried rewards, but they haven't been too successful. We bought him the cinnamon flavored teddy grahams and we call them ""Scooby Snacks"". He knows that if he tells us he has to go potty he will get a treat. That's still not enough though."
daddit,3dzc4g,Mitchly,2,Mon Jul 20 21:01:40 2015 UTC,"My advice would be try to spend a whole day at home having him wearing nothing below the waist. Bring the potty with you to whatever room you are going to be hanging out in, so he can get to it quick. We did this with my daughter and it worked really well. I think most kids don't really get the not going in underwear thing since they are so used to going into whatever they are wearing. Having them not wear anything kind of throws them off their game. Good luck!"

daddit,3dwn9i,SquaredCircle84,4,Mon Jul 20 03:44:09 2015 UTC,Backpack for me. Easy to pick up kids while wearing it.
daddit,3dwn9i,CharliesMaster,2,Mon Jul 20 05:14:32 2015 UTC,Biggest factor for me leaning towards backpack.
daddit,3dwn9i,CrazyIndianJoe,4,Mon Jul 20 19:00:54 2015 UTC,"Messenger bag. Strap cross body puts pockets in an easy to reach position if ever you need a quick wipe, tissue, snack, toy, etc. That way everything stays with the bag. So when you drop them off at daycare or grandparents or anywhere you don't have to make sure everything you tucked into your own pockets makes back to the bag. Granted it will swing forward if you lean forward so obviously use your knees to lift not your back."
daddit,3dwn9i,CrazyIndianJoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:47:43 2015 UTC,Do you ever hold baby on the same side as the bag? Does the bag make it difficult to do that?
daddit,3dwn9i,thudson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:33 2015 UTC,I'm left side dominant so the strap goes across my left shoulder (bag on right) and I carry my son in my left arm. Unless I'm carrying both in which case the older one is on the left and the younger one is on the right as he's still small enough to fit on top of the bag. Then there's days where I have my oldest sons backpack my work duffle my messenger bag with my youngest son on my left while holding my oldest sons hand with my right while we get on the bus. It's times like that where having a messenger bag is super helpful as I can access it without putting anything down.
daddit,3dwn9i,fishous,4,Mon Jul 20 20:21:41 2015 UTC,One thing I didn't think about before going the backpack route: back sweat.

That way every day you will have fresh bananas and they won't go brown by the end of the week. Don't be afraid to break up bunches at the store.

daddit,3dsvlx,RakuWilliams,3,Sun Jul 19 06:30:39 2015 UTC,"Seems to me the smart move is to spend a few years saving and budgeting so that you can make smarter decisions regarding jobs, cars, and housing. If you can get free (or reduced) rent during that time, and also learn how to live in a house with a roommate (ie, dad), then you're already ahead of your peers.

It's only the last few generations where we got away from multi-family homes, what with the explosion of suburbs in the 1950s.  I mean, does everybody really need his own refrigerator, shower, washer/dryer, oven, etc? Future you will be a lot happier if current you builds a solid financial foundation now.  In another decade or so, we're really going to feel the consequences of generations of people pissing money away in their youth. Why do you think so many old people work at McDonald's and WalMart?  With proper planning now, you can retire when you're 50. With smart investing, you can do it at 40 or 45. I know that sounds ancient to you now, but I promise it isn't. You'll be much wiser with your time at that age, too, and really be able to travel and enjoy life.  Good luck to you!"

I hope there was celebration and joy for that.  That being said, if you're kid is going off to school, give them space, but always make time for them.  Don't be surprised if they don't want to go home for spring break.  And keep in touch, call them once and a while just to chat.  That's one thing I hate about my parents, is that they'll NEVER contact me, even though we live 5+ hrs apart, it's always me that has to start a conversation, makes me feel quite unloved.  Oh, and ask your kid if they'd like to share a beer/cooler/wine with you, cause ya know what, as a valedictorian, it seems like they have their head on, and reinforcing this by treating them like an adult will make the bond even more special for you.  EDIT:: Just re-read that and you said you were a single dad... double good job man, raising a kid on your own would be hella difficult... I couldn't comprehend it."

Mom wouldn't let me get snipped after the first one either (she's still so small - what if something happens; maybe we'll change our minds, ...). I was so scared of an accident I offered to use condoms as a backup long term but she didn't like that either (""dry me out and chafe""). So we stuck to her birth control alone until I would get the green light to get snipped.  A couple weeks before our eldest turned 2 she showed me the positive pregnancy test. At first it was termed ""birth control failure"" but later on she admitted not being very strict (kinda deliberately) with her birth control. But even before I knew that, the sadness and depression turned into anger, then that anger grew into resentment and when I started voicing it and acting on it in the second trimester she paid me back in kind. Got snipped 2 months before the second one was born, despite her continued objections.  Our marriage was one foot over the cliff when we decided that we owed it to our kids to give it one last chance, went to couples/marriage counseling. I think we are trough the worst of it now (more than a year later) but our relationship will never be the same. Still I deeply regret bottling up instead working out those feelings in the early days, before we said and did all those things to hurt each other.  If you are seriously depressed or feel powerless get help asap."
daddit,3dsypf,thrown4way0,2,Sun Jul 19 07:45:11 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going to suggest this. I've pulled down my figurative curtain. I cried after she went to bed on Saturday. I've been very vocal about not wanting any more kids after two, and my co-workers today were telling me how much I need a third child. I almost had to leave.   Tonight, as we were making dinner for the boys, she asked me if I was ok. I said, ""I guess I have to be, huh,"" and walked away. I'm not smiling, things don't bring me joy like they did four days ago.  I've spent so much time and worked so hard to plan our future around two children. I almost booked tickets to Disney last week. We've been waiting until they could tolerate the longer drives to do this (we're in the Midwest). I've been looking at a family cruise next spring, using our tax refund. We've been looking at houses, now I can't convince myself we can still do it.   I can't stop feeling like everything we've done and planned over the last three years is as good as toilet paper. I remember every time, as I'm sure she also does right now, I've said how a third kid would be the worst thing. How I would hate having to chase three kids. How I hated being the middle child and didn't want to do the same in my house."
daddit,3dsypf,cagedmonkey28,4,Mon Jul 20 22:50:25 2015 UTC,"This isn't the same situation as yours, but to make a point, I'll tell a quick story:  My wife tried to freak me out once with a fake positive pregnancy test on April Fool's Day once. We were in a similar spot as you were family-wise: 2 kids, house and finances working pretty well, etc. After she kept insisting it was real when I had called BS multilple times, I stopped fighting it and thought maybe it was real. She got mad, though, and finally gave up on the joke when in turned out that I didn't freak out at all about it. The thing I kept saying that pissed her off was that ""we'd make it work.""  That's basically my point: it might seem like you're doomed, it might seem like a horrible unavoidable situation... but when it comes down to it, you'll make it work. Because that's what us dads do - we make the impossible happen for our kids. And when we're done with it all, we get to look back and say ""How the hell did I make that happen?""

May be different at different ages but my 18mo daughter goes down for her nap at 1pm and bedtime at 8pm every day.  Awake or not. It also helps to get you on a schedule too as you'll know to change him prior to sleepy time.   However, when not at home it's all sheets to the wind with sleep schedules. And these schedules can get in the way of running errands. So there are pros and cons."
daddit,3drqjp,urchigold,13,Sat Jul 18 20:40:16 2015 UTC,"Be open and honest with her. Don't whine or complain, but be clear that this is something you want discuss so you're both on the same page. Ultimately, no matter how bad you want it the ball will be in her court (figuratively speaking). Until she is ready, just get used to some hand-to-man combat again.

Make her feel sexy without having to put out, no pressure As much as its up to her to know when she s ready, you dont have to be ashamed of needing it."
daddit,3drqjp,meltingparadiso,2,Sun Jul 19 01:46:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the hard part is the ""nothing with baby in room"" rule, which would include helping me - I typically slink off to the bathroom or another room to do the deed.   MIL lives with us and there was some minor touching when we handed the baby to her for a short time. But giving her the baby is really rare and my wife usually will go ""ok good now I can organize the room"" or something."
daddit,3drqjp,pfafulous,9,Sun Jul 19 11:25:15 2015 UTC,"The podcast Mom and Dad Are Fighting just had an episode about this. The segment starts at 37:01. You get two women's prospectives about  sex after childbirth.  At 8 weeks not much will be happening. I remember my wife around this time telling me it physically hurt her to hear our son crying. So there is some physiological weirdness going on right now for your wife. You mentioned in another comment she is pumping breast milk. This means her estrogen level is down. This hormone is responsible for her sex drive and vaginal wetness - more physiological weirdness.   What worked for my wife and I was making any kind of sex act count as sex. Early on if all my wife wanted to do was make out, that counted as sex. Sure I had to finish on my own but it kept some kind of sexual expression in our lives. (Rather than a roaring fire in the bedroom we had some smoldering coals.) Because we did this I think our sex life came back quicker than if everything was centered around p in the v action. I believe women should get a pass in the first year. They should try to help out their partner, but get to say no and not have it be a problem.   Our sex life got better after the 6 month mark. At that point, the baby is on a regular schedule and may be able to sleep through the night. Taking care of a six month old is remarkably easier than a newborn and the stress of it all, including new parent jitters, starts to melt away.   Good luck and remember there are tons of good porn subs on the NSFW section or reddit."
daddit,3drqjp,busch_chugger,5,Sun Jul 19 02:28:28 2015 UTC,"I like this advice a lot.   8 weeks is nothing. Baby is still adjusting to being alive, and isn't really even a child yet. Nurture your wife's nurturing, and be happy with whatever praise or affection she gives you.  Trust me, she knows you're ready. You don't have to keep reminding her.  You have a baby now. Focus on that, and derive enjoyment from keeping a clean and well running household."

daddit,3drqjp,Strong_Like_Bill,6,Sun Jul 19 00:01:39 2015 UTC,"Is your wife breastfeeding? That can majorly hamper the return of the libido.   And your wife probably feels like a Mom right now, not a sexy being. Remind her that she is sexy in a non-pressuring way. She might feel like she's being touched and needed all day, and she just wants her body to herself.   And lastly, even being cleared for sex doesn't mean she's physically or emotionally ready. That's some major trauma to recover from. She might just be afraid it's really going to hurt (and it might, that's normal).   But, you should be able to talk to her, in a non-pressuring manner, and figure out where the hold up is."

daddit,3drqjp,Doctor_Banjo,3,Sun Jul 19 11:29:09 2015 UTC,"You know how you feel about sex during your refractory period, how your brain is all ""yes! Let's do this!"" but your body is like ""....urggh...low battery... pancakes...""? New moms can feel that way for a very long time post partum: they know (rationally and emotionally) they want to sleep with you again but they just aren't ready (physically and hormonally) to make it work yet. The rules she's putting around it might be half-truths: not in the room with baby because (a) she's finding it hard not to concentrate 100% on baby right now but also (b) she's just not physically into sex right now and doesn't know how to say so without risking your feelings.  As others have said, the length of time varies but often will last until (a) her period comes back or (b) breast feeding/pumping ends or at least slows down. And even then there can be a lot of work for her to do to feel sexy in her ""new"" body, which for many women is a big adjustment. Add in some post-partum fatigue (common even after babies start sleeping through the night) and/or post-partum depression (get to know and keep a close watch for symptoms), and it's all a recipe for temporary celibacy. My wife and I are 4 months in and even without lactation pressures we still haven't bounced back, though she has brought up the subject and clearly wants (intellectually) to do it.  Anyway, with all the pressure of a new baby at home, it can be difficult to communicate your needs to her without it feeling like ""just one more burden"" or like another post-baby expectation she's not living up to. What's working for me to begin thawing the ice is to help my wife with her own self care, since it sounds like she's falling into the trap of ""everything's about the baby now."" Taking shifts with the baby so she can get more sleep or take a long shower, helping arrange for her to get time for her previous hobbies and interests, and keeping her talking about her own needs and feelings, which it sounds like you're already doing, will help her keep some focus on herself while you two adjust to your new lives.  Hang in there. It can be a very long wait, and when it comes back it probably won't be the same as it was before - not worse, maybe better, just... changed. Stay close, keep up the cuddles, shake hands with yourself as necessary, and try not to be perceived as pushy. All she says about how you're handsome, supportive, a great Dad... She'll remember those things when her libido returns and want to jump you even more because of them. It'll be worth the wait!"
daddit,3drqjp,erbtastic,8,Sun Jul 19 12:33:54 2015 UTC,"You should review  the no sex with baby in the room rule.  Babies are like cats they dont care that you are having sex, they wont perceive that you're doing anything special.  Only thing is your wife and your perception of it.

On the way home I got a bottle of Tito's vodka. I installed the shelves and my friend asked me out for a drink or three.   Next morning I woke up very hungover dreading cleaning that room up. I go downstairs and to my surprise drunk me had done all the cleaning and a bit more.   My routine continued on until they came back. I ended up getting a sinus infection and throwing my back out (again) by the time they came back. If they ever leave for a week I will probably need a bondsman.

I think the same thing happens to people when they are single and they lose their job. The responsibilities give you motivation to do the things you have to do rather than the things you want to do. When they are gone, the motivation switches priorities to the want. I would say it's normal, since I do it all the time when the wife and kid are out.  I usually give myself a list of need-type things to do during that time just to feel productive. Not too much though, so I still have time to play games or watch a movie or do any of the other stuff I just want to do, but just enough to feel satisfied that I accomplished something."

They always have those moments though.  There is a brief period (it lasts only like a minute) between age 5 years and age 12 where they are fun children that love you and respect you.  You are going through the 30 year period between age 0 months through age 1 year which is murderous.  After age 1 year you have approximately 4 years of frazzled frustration.  That said, quit smoking, try the vape or the gum or something, you'll feel better about yourself and live longer and be happier and still get your nicotine."

They see one isolated event and think they see the easy answer and think we as parents are weak because we can't just relax and do what they think would be the best option, but forget them.  because it's not the one little thing that makes it hard.  It's the CONSTANT PILE of one thing after another thing after another thing after another thing.  There is no break!  There is no government that can come and say ""It is illegal for someone to operate a child with out at least a 5 minute break every hour and a 1 hour lunch every 8 hours.""  We don't have a union that can fight for our rights as workers or that can argue that the end product would benefit from us having some alone time every now and then.  You just have to bake in it, and instead of sympathy or support, you have to feel the embarrassment of and scorn of the old ladies giving out unwarranted advice at the super market and the young man that laughs and thinks he knows everything.  So, I know you aren't looking for advice, and I know you aren't even looking for justification.  But I can tell you this at least.  Man, I've been there.  And I understand.  And there is nothing wrong with what you are doing, because it is in the best interest of the little person you are tasked with taking care of.  You are in a thankless position with horrible hours and low pay, and at 3-years old you are facing the worst of it.  So, enjoy your break, guilt free.

daddit,3dol1x,santa_91,2,Sat Jul 18 00:03:25 2015 UTC,Neither me nor her mom can figure out what's wrong
daddit,3dol1x,Sunsparc,4,Sat Jul 18 00:21:16 2015 UTC,It's possible that it's PURPLE crying.  It's normal and you are doing exactly what you should be doing.  http://purplecrying.info/
daddit,3dol1x,JonPublic,3,Sat Jul 18 00:26:36 2015 UTC,"You say this as a joke, but my wife works in a hospital and loves to tell the story of the pissed off dad.  He comes up to the nurses station in Mother/Baby and asks the nurses why they can't get his day old son to stop crying.  The kid has been crying for three hours, there's got to be something they can do.  The nurse looks him straight in the eyes and tells him to give his newborn a cigarette to smoke.  He looks confused.  The nurse says that since the mom smoked at least a pack a day throughout her pregnancy, the baby was having a nic-fit, going through withdrawal symptoms.  He just turns around and walks back to the room."
daddit,3dol1x,tenakakahn,3,Sat Jul 18 05:10:23 2015 UTC,Inexplicable crying at 2 or 3 months always meant gas for my son. Try putting her on her back and moving her legs like she's pedaling a bike if you haven't already.
daddit,3dol1x,Mertyn,2,Sat Jul 18 05:04:49 2015 UTC,"I know you said you're not asking for help, but I'm going to suggest anyway because I'd feel the same in your position but would be grateful if a solution was found for me.  Checklist:    Bottle  Burp  Diaper Sleep   If the screaming is an ongoing thing, talk with your pediatrician. If anyone in your immediate family is lactose intolerant, there's a good chance she might be also and needs special formula. My son fussed for weeks straight around 2 months old until we figured out his formula needs. He's on Nutramigen now and is the happiest baby."
daddit,3dol1x,Promac,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:30:02 2015 UTC,"You can also continue to breastfeed (if it's going well) by monitoring the mother's diet a bit more strictly. My wife had to go off of tomato-based sauces and cow milk while feeding. This removed the baby's reflux and let him settle down. Reflux is a hard thing to spot sometimes, (other times you just have to look at your shirt, though, lol) and it can create a lot of 'unknown' crying fits if it isn't causing spit-up."
daddit,3dol1x,Mertyn,2,Sat Jul 18 03:48:50 2015 UTC,"Been there, heading back there again with our second. Damn its hard, damn it sucks.  One thing, a warm and deep bath might settle them or at least get their attention. It's also skin to skin time. Worked more than half the time with our first and has worked a charm with our second.  Also, could be wind... Which just sucks until they deal with it."

daddit,3dol1x,davewasthere,2,Sat Jul 18 09:39:29 2015 UTC,"You did the right thing walking away, as long as she's got a clean nappy and not due a feed at that age there's not much more you can do.  She'll get a lot more out of you after a 5 minute break to have a cigarette and chill out. Stick with it we all have bad days!"
daddit,3dol1x,cantwaitforthis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:31:18 2015 UTC,"Dude,  I know that feeling. Had to put my baby down and walk away a lot. It will get better. The first few months are ridiculous. There is only screaming and trying to make the screaming stop.  There is a light at the end of the tunnel though (for the most part). Screaming and crying still happens at 11 months but it doesn't even compare to the first 3 months. She will sleep eventually and you can relax. Just keep doing what you're doing and experimenting to find what makes her stop screaming."
daddit,3dol1x,knotquiteawake,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:35:53 2015 UTC,"Well walking away is a good choice. 3 months old ducks, can't tell what's wrong. I always went for a tummy massage. When my son was grumpy it was from tummy pain. If that didn't work, I sang him songs and did the daddy bounce rock thing, like bend your knees and go up and down while turning"
daddit,3dol1x,mherchel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:40:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if there's wind, the tummy massage isn't a bad choice. When my little girl was three months this occasionally helped.. We went to a massage class to learn to do it, but essentially it's clockwise strokes to help relieve her of built up air. Worth watching some YouTube videos if unsure.  Normally crying is food, wind, sleep or cuddles... But every now and again it was hard to figure out what was ailing her. I remember that helpless/unknowing look on both of our faces... Fun times."

If you're buying the kid a toy that plays music, being able to turn that shit down is nice. Don't be overly concerned by the growth charts the doctors throw at you. 'Your daughter has fallen off her growth curve', ya well she's also running around and talking and laughing and reading. She's doing just fine.  One thing we did that I'm super proud of is start reading early. When my wife was 6 months pregnant we started reading to her every night. It's something we all look forward to. Countless books later, and she still loves it. The other morning she grabbed Thrasher magazine walked over to the couch, looked up at me and said 'Read'  So proud"

daddit,3dom67,dattitz,2,Fri Jul 17 23:51:29 2015 UTC,"I would argue that a bottle warmer, while not necessarily needed, is nice when it's 3 a.m. and Jr is hungry and you don't want to stand at the sink waiting for the water to warm up. Saves on gas bill too.  The crib bumper pads are so they don't get stuck in the slats and potentially try to roll over and hurt themselves, would recommend.  Would recommend the off brand bumbo seat that has a round thing with toys on it they can play with and the removable insert for when they're older and you want them to eat at the table versus a high chair. It has straps to put it in a regular chair.  Would recommend a bassinet too. We used one with our oldest, our youngest is having issues going to sleep and staying asleep, but if your kid well sleep in the bassinet, get it. Ours has wheels on it, and it was nice to be able to keep our daughter right by us wherever we were. True, you could use a crib or pack n play, but you can't move them easily from one room to another with baby still in them.  A lot of the things you ""need"" for baby are opinion based, and may oray not work well for all babies. Your mileage will vary."
daddit,3dom67,Gh0sT07,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:23:27 2015 UTC,"If the baby doesn't care if the milk is cold, neither should you. It's not bad for them.  Crib bumpers, on the other hand, ARE bad. They are discouraged by the AAP and pretty much everybody else. Empty crib, always. No pillows, toys, or bumpers. Cribs are far safer than they were in the 70s."

daddit,3dom67,pfafulous,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:59:40 2015 UTC,"I know my first would spit everything up if it was cold, had to be warm. Bottle warmer helped, I wish we had had the money for a baby breeza, it's a pricey frivolous convenience device though."
daddit,3dom67,Gh0sT07,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:30:53 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with the automatic formula mixer being on the not-recommended list.  I dont know what equivalent they have in America but with our daughter we bought the Tommee Tippee Perfect Prep machine. ( http://m.tommeetippee.co.uk/product/perfect-prep-machine/) and it was a freaking god send!   Push the button and it steams/sterilises the inside of the bottle and fills an ounce of boiling water. Put the powder in and push the button again and it fills to the selected amount, at the perfect temperature.  The process take literally 3 minutes including putting the powder in.   This is the only baby gadget that didn't end up on ebay/in the loft, and I've recommend it to anyone and everyone."
daddit,3dom67,r3dfox8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:30:05 2015 UTC,"I think several things on that list are straight up bad advice:   DO NOT USE A BABY MIRROR IN THE CARSEAT! If you put her in there properly, she will be fine. Having a mirror is a huge distraction to you. Your baby is far safer if your eyes are on the road at all times. Be careful with bouncers, as anything more than half an hour is really bad for baby's hips. Same with Baby Bjorns (that brand specifically). They say crib bumpers are not needed, but what they should say is that they are dangerous. The AAP and everybody else is on record recommending against them. Empty crib, always. Your kitchen sink is a cesspool of bacteria. Get a tub, they're cheap. That way you can wash anywhere. It also makes it easier for both parents to wash together, which makes it a lot smoother with a newborn.   All that said, I absolutely agree about a good stroller, especially if you're in an urban area. That's always been non-negotiable with me."

daddit,3dnh8v,Eran-of-Arcadia,3,Fri Jul 17 19:18:15 2015 UTC,"12 month olds are the best.  Big enough to sit in the high chair.  Small enough to not be upset about sitting in the high chair.  Motor skills enough to pick things up off their tray and eat them on their own.  Not big enough to have to buy their own meal. Curious enough about food that they can entertain themselves for longer periods with what is on their plate. And if they are tired and start to melt you can still usually give them to mom to nurse in silence while you plan your escape.  Kids are inconsistent though.  You never know what they are going to be like at a restaurant and I think the part that messes with my mind is that once you sit down and order you are pretty much stuck and have to stay.  At the grocery store, it's easy, you can head to the check out and eject at the first sign of chaos.  But at a restaurant you are chained to the table for the duration of the ride."

She is an adult now, and you seem to think she was a bit younger when she took them.  She was probably a stupid kid doing something dumb.  Every kid does something dumb.  I am sure you could attempt to talk to her about it, but she is an adult now, so either she is going to be super weirded out that you found them, or super pissed off that you are confronting her about them."
daddit,3dmg4v,davdev,7,Fri Jul 17 13:52:02 2015 UTC,"Here's what I'd do (as a father of three boys with no experience with this).   Delete them, try to forget that they exist and move on. She's older now and assuming you trust her to be a responsible person, write it off as an experiment. Besides, there's nothing you can do except get rid of them. If they're out there, there's not much you can do about it. We all hope they're not out there (and there's no indication that they are, she may just have wanted to try taking a naughty selfie but not actually do anything with it). Just trust that she's not doing anything dumb, and if the opportunity arises to reinforce existing lessons about online safety take them, but don't try to go looking for it, or starting a conversation with her about it."
daddit,3dmg4v,arth33,2,Fri Jul 17 14:05:49 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely nothing to worry about. Delete them and move on.

I'll save the narrative but afterwards, we barely spoke for a couple weeks and it ultimately ended our relationship.   I think its because I wasnt there 100%, didnt console her or show her how I was hurting too and be there for her.  You gotta be behind her 200%, she will flip out at things like that but theres nothing you can do except support her. The thing my wife and I found with our child is that from the time of finding out, day 1 there is so much of connection between the baby and momma. We as men cant even comprehend but we get a sense of it when we feel the kicks and when we finally get to meet our little ones. So imagine that connection, then it being completely taken away.

Miscarriage is beyond your control, but termination, for health reasons, or any reason. You have to give the go ahead. Whether you have that option or even if you dont.

So, __ Insert Groom's name here__ I'm sure you felt you had a lot to do with winning her over, but fact of the matter is, once she made up her mind, you were done for.   In fact, 30 years ago she wrote this letter (pull letter out of breastpocket and unfold it. Pause for laughter.) that I'd like to read to you all now just to show you precisely how she made you fall in love with her.   Read Letter with examples of how things that she actually does as an adult  When laughter subsides, pull out another letter from the same pocket  Now, interestingly enough, I ALSO made a similar list 30 years ago....  Accept applause, and read your list. Make sure to align them to real-life examples of things that her husband-to-be actually does because face it, if you're giving this speech, she's marrying him. :)   Then move into your actual speech. Good luck!  Bonus: If the groom is actually the boy she wrote this to, then it will be even more amazing when you tell him about it."

Honestly, it's just really, really hard right now.   My mom died two years ago, also at 55, of cancer. We at least had time to prepare with her. Lots of conversations, in-depth personal ones. Recorded her voice for my children.   My two older kids got to spend a lot of time with her, and all of my kids spent a lot of time with my father. I can't recommend anything other than spending a lot of time with him and having honest conversations."
daddit,3digcl,CC_EF_JTF,4,Thu Jul 16 16:18:57 2015 UTC,"So sorry for your loss, and thanks so much for your recommendations.

Thanks again, and best luck in your healing as well."
daddit,3digcl,kayatar,5,Thu Jul 16 16:48:06 2015 UTC,"I would recommend getting him a do-it-yourself autobiography.  Just something that asks him questions about his past or his take on different topics.  He will probably appreciate that you are interested in what he has to say and you'll be glad you have that after he is gone.  I have given one to my parents and in-laws although I think most of them are slacking on filling them out.  Wish I had given one to my Mom before she passed.  She died before I got married or had any kids so I sometimes wonder what her take would be on certain things.  You might also want to spend some time doing something that your Father likes.  I have a friend that recently went golfing with his 7 year old son for the first time.  I don't really like golf, but being a somewhat new father myself, that sounded really appealing to me.  A great chance to bond with your child.  I think I might ask my Dad if he wants to go golfing sometime.  Best of luck to you and your Father."

I will definitely look into this, and once the dust settles as far as finalizing diagnosis/treatment plans, I will definitely plan to pass one along.  Good luck with the golf outing!  I really appreciate your thoughts on focusing on experiences and not ""things"".  I'll definitely get going on a list…  Thanks also for the well wishes."

daddit,3digcl,just3ws,4,Fri Jul 17 03:11:01 2015 UTC,"My father died on my 13th birthday.  It was sudden, with no warning.  So my experience doesn't translate to what you are going through.  What it did make me focus on what how to maximize my time with my daughter and how to prepare for when I did and if it happens with her at a young age. I started a journal where I talked about everything and anything I could about me, like I was having a conversation with her as an adult.  I talk about growing up, my father dying, what I was like as a kid and teenager, my time in the Navy, meeting and marrying her mom, what it was like when she was born and about all the events of her life so far.  I am not the best writer, but this way if I drop tomorrow she can read this and get a sense of who I was and everything I thought and felt.  That was the 1 positive thing I took away from losing my Dad at such an early age.  At this point I don't even remember what his voice really sounded like.  I am sorry about the situation you are in, but it is great that you want maximize the time.  I would talk to him and write down as much of what he says as you can.  Take videos, audio recordings, anything you can.  Get him to tell you all about him, especially things you didn't know.  Get him to tell you about the family while you were growing up.  I have found that my version and my mom's differ quite a bit and I learn a bunch of things I didn't know anything about, even though I was there.  Best of luck to you and your family."
daddit,3digcl,just3ws,4,Thu Jul 16 19:42:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for sharing, and sorry as well for your loss at such a young age.    I really like the idea of the notebook.  It's so true how perceptions of things change so much in memory.  What a gift it could be to have a contemporary record of what my thoughts/impressions of events surrounding my kiddos were at different ages.    I'll definitely step up the recording as well.  I didn't mention in the original post that there is a significant distance between our homes, but thank goodness for the internet and Skype!  Thanks again."
daddit,3digcl,rr_coyote,4,Thu Jul 16 20:46:21 2015 UTC,"Goddammit this is a sensitive spot for me. (trigger warning much?! just kidding. :) My Dad passed away suddenly when my oldest was only ~2 years old, I have one video of him with her as I followed them around the house. He never got to meet his grandson or youngest granddaughter. Goddammit I have to keep stopping typing.  My mother in law passed away about a year or so before that. My  mother was around long enough to hold my son before she passed from cancer. Fortunately I was able to mentally prepare for her passing but my dad was and still is a raw wound. My father in law is the center of his own universe whom I won't speak of further except to say that he leaves me astounded at times in his inability to recognize the beauty of his only grandchildren but he lacked compassion for his own kids so he is just being consistent.  As for how my father's death affected me. It reminds me that telling my son that I love him and am proud of HIM are the only legacy I can leave for him that matters. My daughters and I have a loving relationship and they know I love them. That one day I will be gone and won't be there for him is the scariest thing I carry with me every day. My wife and I focus on teaching our children to trust and support each other and work as a team so that when we're gone they'll have someone to have their backs. My father was more in the ""lone wolf americana"" style of hyper-independence, I don't say that derisively but I don't say it as a compliment either. He was fiercely reliable, to a fault but was also very demanding and aloof from me. I know how that felt, and that I will not put my son through that. ... But this isn't the actual question you're asking...  I wish that I had more evidence of my dad with my kids. Pictures, videos, anything. Just something I could show my daughter who asks and wishes for a grandparent. ""See, her's a picture of you with your grandpa, he really loved you and thought you were great."" I didn't have ""affectionate"" grandparents who were the type to dote over their grandkids, so also know a bit how that feels. Being able to know that you belong in a continuity of family that loves you seems to be important for kids. Like with my son when he plays with trucks ""Oh, that's a truck like your grandpa drove, he would have liked yours."" seems to be something he likes hearing. So I'd say exposing your kids as much as possible and recording those interactions with him would be something nice that they can look back at when they want to know more about their dad's dad.  For you, since you have a chance to make any peace you have with him then I'd say you should do it now. If there's something you want to hear from him, then tell him. I wish I could go back and tell my father what I wanted/needed to hear him say. ""You remember that time that you said I'd come crawling back? Well, I didn't. So I need you to acknowledge that.""  Touch him. If you're not the kind of family that hugs or kisses then get over it. If he doesn't like being hugged then tell him he won't have to be bothered by it much longer but you'll be the one who will be left behind.  I was thinking about what I would do if I could have one last call with my dad a few days ago. Just a random thought that popped in my head. But I had the idea that I would list years and ask him to describe that year to me. 1965, what happened that year? Where were you working? Did you still live in the old house. Then bring it forward to present day. I thought that would be an interesting conversation.  Ah, what do I know? I don't know. Thanks for letting me ramble. I'm going to take a walk. Good luck OP, I hope things work out for as long as they can despite the dire prognosis."
daddit,3digcl,pocket_fox,3,Thu Jul 16 19:46:58 2015 UTC,"Fellow Dad - thanks so much for sharing, and I apologize for dredging this up.  I was worried this would trigger such emotions in some folks, so I do apologize.    As I read every word you wrote now (and will read it repeatedly, I'm sure), I'm finding some great wisdom in what you've shared.  At a first pass, the ""hugs"" part is one point that sticks out - we've also been pretty stoic/""formal"" in our relationship.  I don't think I really saw him cry openly when either of his parents died, although I knew he was very sad.  I made the decision to try to be more open with this type of emotion, so when his brother recently died, I let the tears flow in front my daughter (not easy, but I'm glad I did).  I also really like the prompt about describing different years.  I look forward to discussing this more after the dust settles.  I hope the walk was helpful, and thank you for the well wishes!"

Now that I know my second child now I realize how silly that thought process was.  To go further, I thought there would be no way I could love my firstborn as much as I love my wife, but that changed too. I realize now that it seems like there isn't a finite amount of love one can give; your capacity grows with each new person there is to love.  God, I've gotten sappy since I've become a father..."

He can he so caring and loving and cute and then he destroys all his cred when he sneaks out of bed in the middle of the night, finds the fiber gummys and eats a dozen of them... the little shit had to take a big shit.

I just have a tip that helps my back: when going along your standard empty sidewalk, you can hold one side of the handle with one hand and kind of push standing off-center to the side of the stroller. When you push with one hand like this, you're not as hunched forward and it helps your back. But if there's any kind of crowd or bump where you need two hands, back to the standard pushing position."

And also be understanding when something gets in the way, be it she can't find a sitter, or odd ""visiting hours"", etc. You're just going to have to be patient and flexible. I say this because her ex sounds like a piece of work and there's a good chance he's not going to be a participating father."
daddit,3deqii,mopeygoff,2,Wed Jul 15 18:50:54 2015 UTC,"I gotcha. That all makes sense. I'm ready to be patient and understanding of things.   Her ex is a bit of a piece of work, too. I don't judge, but take yesterday for example. It was his day off and his chance to see his son, but he called her (the girl I'm seeing) and told her that he wanted her to watch their son so he could go golfing. The guy hasn't seen his son in days and gets the chance to do it and he pawns him off to go golfing? To me, that's kind of messed up. Then he took his son back for the night, pretty much just to sleep.   I don't get it."
daddit,3deqii,mopeygoff,2,Wed Jul 15 19:40:00 2015 UTC,Yep.    In my personal case my ex was very flakey in the beginning. She'd miss about 1/3 to 1/2 of her visitations. It made it difficult to really be able to plan things but it's still doable.  I dated a single mom before I dated my ex wife and when we couldn't make plans we would have movie night. I'd drop by blockbuster (ha! THAT LONG AGO!) and pick up a couple flicks + some microwave popcorn and some drinks and we'd order in to her place. I'd show up after the kids went to bed.  I did something similar post-divorce when my ex flaked on visitation as well.   That's what I mean about being flexible and creative. Think outside the box!
daddit,3deqii,17sjs,3,Wed Jul 15 19:50:02 2015 UTC,Right. We've already had to change our plans multiple times because the dad flaking out on taking time with his son. We've just kind of rolled with it and taken it as it comes.
daddit,3deqii,17sjs,3,Wed Jul 15 19:56:41 2015 UTC,"Advice right now?  You've only been with her a month, focus on your relationship and deciding on how serious you are about her.  Personally I wouldn't be considering spending any time with her son until you're at least 6 months in, maybe 12.  At that point, if you're both in the right headspace then you can start getting to know the little man and slowly becoming part of his life too.  He may be young but your presence will unavoidably have an impact.  Make sure you're ready to take responsibility for that before you do so.  And once (if) you do decide to commit, understand that you need to do so completely.  No figurative foot out the door just in case.  My 2 cents, from someone who has an 18mth old and my own childhood experience of divorced parents plus the experience of my mother's later relationship with another man not working out.  He was more of a father to me during that time than my actual father was, and it was painful when he left.  Don't do that to the kid."
daddit,3deqii,incride,3,Wed Jul 15 19:50:10 2015 UTC,"Good call. Like I said, I've known her for at least 5 years. We worked together for most of that time, so we get along great and we both know how to be around each other. I can talk to her in the most open way I've ever talked with a partner before. I know it's ""only been a month,"" but it isn't like this is some random that I met off the streets.....buuuuuttttttt I get what you're saying.   Committing to her means committing to her son as well and that is a huge step not to be taken lightly."

daddit,3dgnat,MySweetUsername,3,Thu Jul 16 03:02:07 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I'm not a dad, I'm a mom, and also a masters educated Montessori teacher working with infants through 6 year old children. This may not be the response you are looking for, but since no one else is responding, I am just going to offer my perspective.   First thing, pull-ups are diapers. Your son has a perfectly effective and simple way of eliminating his waste. He goes in the diaper. He's always done this, all three years of his life have been this way, he hasn't mastered anything else, and nothing has changed for him except your expectations. So he's in a diaper, needs to go, and since it's what he knows best, he does so. Punishing him for not mastering something that is difficult and confusing enough by itself is counterproductive at best.   Second, he may be getting some mixed messages. So, he's in a diaper, and he knows what to do in the diaper, and you tell him not to, but he does, and you wait until after dinner to clean him up. He may be getting the message that even though you say it should be different, it's not important enough for even you to attend to immediately, so why should he bother?   Third, he goes in his diaper, which, again, he's always done, and has TV taken away. He might not be able to see how those two things are related. The punishment doesn't fit the ""crime"" so to speak. 3 year olds have some seriously complex emotions and thoughts but not always the means to express them. Hence, meltdowns when things aren't as expected and confusing.   If you want to make headway, you might consider ditching the diapers, get some cotton training pants, and get more active in the training itself. Have him sit on the toilet more often, have him assist in the clean up right away when accidents happen, announce when you feel the urge to go, bring him in the bathroom when you and talk him through your process. Encourage attempts, celebrate successes, and forget the punishments. Toilet training is really hard, not only for us! Children may seem to learn slowly, but think about all that has to go into learning such a huge skill, especially when it's first unlearning diapers and then relearning a completely different, much more difficult method. So, be patient. He will get there, and so will you."
daddit,3dgnat,owlsayshoot,3,Thu Jul 16 14:31:54 2015 UTC,thanks for the great response!
daddit,3dgnat,Fenn2010,2,Thu Jul 16 15:11:32 2015 UTC,"I don't have a kid old enough yet that is ready for potty training, but it seems like you are focusing on the negative and not the positive. Kids react much better when they are rewarded for something, not when they have something taken away from them. Also, at this age, they just do not understand the connection between going in their diaper and 'no nightly luxuries'. The two are not linked in their mind, so its somewhat of a useless punishment and may be why you aren't making headway. Its also confusing for him since he is in a diaper and its been a perfectly fine thing for him to use for the last 3 years.   So it might be good to get him out of diapers. A change in routine like this might be the trigger he needs and may help him form a connection--he is a big boy now and doesn't need diapers but he has to use the potty when he wants to go. Accidents are going to happen! You need to do your best to never get upset or angry when it occurs, or else you are sending mixed messages that might make the problem worse.  My wife used to work in a daycare center and was known as the potty training master. Basically it required a marathon day or two of the kid basically never leaving the bathroom upon any indication of having to use it. She would have them sit on the toilet until they did their business or were absolutely positive they did not have to go at that time and they had to make sure to let her know as soon as they thought they had to go, and she literally dropped everything and got them to the bathroom.   I know for my niece and nephew, it worked very well to offer them a reward each time they asked and used the potty--the reward was just a piece of candy or a little trinket. Anytime an accident happened, they were cleaned up, never scolded, but did not get anything either. The incentive to get a reward for getting to the bathroom on time seemed to work very well for them.   Another technique my mom used on me was she took me to the store when I was in the training stage and she had me pick out an expensive toy. She explained to me that I did not get it until I was successful for a few days at going on the potty with no accidents. She put it in plain sight on top of the refrigerator which was on the way to the bathroom and in view from the playroom. I could always see it but never get to it, and I guess that was enough for me."

At the end of the week they spend their XP to level up (increase their privileges) or buy smaller favours (buy lunch at school one day, choose the Saturday activity). If they are naughty they can loose a life, which means loss of privileges to a degree depending on how many lives they have, these can be bought back with XP.   It works really well.

That’s just normal, and in fact, virtually every dad I know, my peer group, is in the same situation. It’s interesting that society doesn’t seem to acknowledge this very much. Society talks about deadbeat dads, or bumbling dad humor, or they over correct and are calling people “super dads” or we focus on stay-at-home dads. The fact is, there are millions of dads out there, and virtually every dad I know cares a lot about his career, and earning for the family, and being a really good hands-on, involved father.      Exactly. I'm not super man, I'm just being a dad in the 21st century. Nothing special.

At the end the nurses were like ""Are you okay?"" and he didn't respond, he just kept starting at the needle. They seemed a bit concerned and asked again ""Are you okay?""

As long as he is taking time to get better at something, its fine with me. Oh, and one day we will build up an old Land Cruiser or CJ and go on an adventure.

He's back to a big vocabulary now at 2yo, but it was an odd time.  Your baby may get frustrated by not being able to communicate with you, when she knows what she means, but you don't.

I've always loved thunderstorms and I was lucky to be able to instill the same excitement and lack of fear into my toddler from the first clap. I am mostly convinced that fear and anxiety is completely a learned behavior, whether it's thunder or new foods or new people, or whatever. Kids pick up on every little mannerism and vocal tone we parents exhibit; they are wired to learn that way. No one is born with a fear or dislike of a specific thing. So, if I am unsure if my kids won't like a new food, for example, I try very hard to hide my apprehension and I don't try to oversell it, either.  So far, so good. I'll see if it works for the baby girl in the next year or so."

I'm tall (6'7"") and my wife is short (5'6"") and it fits both of us. The Stokke is good, just can be very complicated for daily use. The back support on the Stokke is nice though.   All said and done, it can take a few tries, so you can try on different ones at some stores ( buy buy baby has a good selection ) and see which ones your baby is most comfortable in and which ones you feel most comfortable in."

Look for a local chapter and go to the meetings, we pay $30 a year and can borrow a different carrier each month. It's allowed me to try out a bunch and get educated on how best to use them with my baby. I have a 4 month old, and I have gone through 3 different carriers that I liked. As she gets heavier and more wiggly I found my needs changed. As a newborn I liked the Boba stretchy wrap, then I moved onto the Mei Tai style wrap, now I love using the Catbirdbaby Pikkolo. My wife uses a couple of different ones depending on what the activities of the day are. But finding a local group to help you is the best for safety and comfort."
daddit,3d5wxq,clarkhead,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:09:20 2015 UTC,This one allowed me to walk my son about 2 miles to daycare every morning from ~6 months on. I still use it now (18 months) for longer hikes like distant parking lots.
daddit,3d5wxq,natacon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:11:26 2015 UTC,"I have an 11 month old who weighs a bit over 25 lbs. since he was very little I've used a Beco Gemini and like it very much. I'm a stay at home/work at home dad, so the carrier is absolutely a life saver on a daily basis for getting anything done and going on errands.   For father's day my wife got me a fancy carrier from South Korea called a Pognae Hipseat. I find the Beco easier to use, but as my boy gets larger I worry about the tension a standard carrier puts on his joints & hips - basically they sit in the thing facing forward and splayed out. The Pognae has a little seat in front, attached to the waist strap. You look a little ridiculous with the thing half-on, as it's kind of like a giant misplaced codpiece, but the result is that the kid is sitting in a natural position and no pressure is unduly placed on the joints. Bottom line, the Beco is somewhat more comfortable for me, but I can definitely see that the Pognae is more comfortable for my son.   Another benefit of the Pognae is that you can unzip the carrier cover and just use the hipseat part. Meaning it's really easy to stand the kid up to change clothes on the fly or even sit him down for a bottle on the go. This video gives a good overview of what the Pognae does.  The Beco is somewhat more comfortable for longer stretches. I think the Pognae might be made to rest more on a lady's hips, which, of course, I don't have. Not sure how many dads are taking the reins in South Korea these days.   Both carriers can be used front facing, inward facing and on the back. Haven't really tried back carries yet. Seems like a great way to get drool in your hair."
daddit,3d5wxq,BareFootMumma,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:22:06 2015 UTC,"We have a Tula Foxy and it's great. Our kids are now 4 and 2 and I they can still fit in it comfortably. It spreads the weight well, and supports their hips which a lot of the other carriers don't do so well. I can't speak of the baby insert as we just have the standard carrier. In the four years we've been baby wearing, we have been through the baby bjorn, the ergo, manduca and a bunch of fabric wraps and ring slings and the Tula is the one we both like the best."
daddit,3d5wxq,madrigal50,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:09:43 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your looking for a soft structured carrier, then main thing to avoid is anything with a narrow base (ie traditional style BabyBjorn) as they don't hold baby in an optimal, comfortable position and even though they have quite a high weight limit they get uncomfortable very quickly once baby puts on a few kg.    Tula, Manduca and Ergobaby are all pretty similar and keep babies hips in the optimal 'M' position.  Personally for a 1 month old I'd get a Manduca since that has the infant insert built in rather than needing a separate cushion thing for small babies.  If heat is your main issue (as you mentioned re the Moby) you might also want to check out a ring sling.  A ring sling only has 1 layer of fabric over you and baby so it's probably the coolest option out of all carrier styles. Look for pure cotton or cotton/linen mix rather than those cheaper synthetic ones you see on ebay."
daddit,3d5wxq,campkev,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:01:26 2015 UTC,"Solly baby wrap! Same concept as the Moby, but with better materials that breathe much better.

daddit,3d4c9k,ScoobySmith,8,Mon Jul 13 18:00:24 2015 UTC,"1) You are going to get peed on. It happens. It's not a big deal.  2) Keep a burp cloth on you at all times.  3) Your baby is going to cry. It's OK and, more importantly, don't freak out and try and stop the crying all the time. This is especially true for tummy time -- they cry like nuts but it's good for them.  4) If you're raising the child with his/her mother, make sure she's happy and calm. That comes first -- it's just way too hard to manage both a crying kid and an overwhelmed partner at the same time.  5) Your sleep habits will adjust quickly. Don't freak out about it."

daddit,3d4c9k,c435087,2,Wed Jul 15 01:48:36 2015 UTC,"There's no shortcut in making your newborn baby sleep through the night sooner. In the beginning, it will be hard. You will lose sleep and you will be frustrated. One thing I recommend and wish I had done, is having help (night nurse, post partum doula, or family/friend).  Try not to think of ""how can we get the baby to adjust to our schedule"". Babies are on their own schedule, very true for newborns. Just know that both you and baby need time to adjust to this new lifestyle. My son is two months. He's starting to sleep about 4 hour between feedings during the night. There are still times where he will only sleep two hours between feedings at night. And he also peed on me twice today, but I still love him.  Making sure your wife gets her rest is also key. It usually takes mom about 6 weeks to recover from a natural birth. Getting that rest will help her bounce back.   Don't rush. Take time off work if you can, it will be worth it."

This is true but I promise you it only lasts the first 1-2 months. If your SO plans on breast feeding, support her AS. MUCH. AS. YOU. CAN! It's soul sucking to sit there for 45 minuets, every 2-3 hours while everyone is in another room laughing and having fun. If friends or family are there and she needs to go feed, go with her. Sit with her. Keep her company. Make her laugh. Never EVER criticize her taking care of the baby. In any way. She's with the baby all day and if you're at work and come home and say, ""Maybe the baby is crying cause she's hungry."" You will not only get the look of death but a shoe thrown at you and no sex for a month! Even though that is totally the reason baby is crying, after a full day of feeding and a crying baby you're SO won't have the patience to listen to reason. Just take the baby, send her to the shower or to get a pedicure and then feed the baby. Most of the time, baby is crying because she's hungry. The doctors told me this and I didn't listen because I felt like I fed her so much! I was incredibly offended when people would say this because it's like, ""Do you think I am starving me baby?!?!?"" When I did finally listen, 2 months in, baby stopped crying and slept 8-10 hours at night!  Heres a few tips that helped us and our 6 month old baby. People always comment on how intelligent and well behaved she is:  *Start taking the baby out. As long as your SO is up to going out take the baby to dinner, take her to the movies, just take her out. This will help build her immunity, as well as get her used to being out and around people. We took baby to the movies all the time and she would just sleep the whole time. It will be stressful at first cause you have to bring all their shit but you'll get used to it and be more efficient. We took her out as soon as she was 1 week. When my SO went back to work, I took baby out everyday to tire her out and so I wouldn't go crazy. By the time we got home, she would be sleepy and we would start our night time routine.  *At first, EVERYTHING is a process. Breastfeeding is a process. Bottle feeding is a process. Formula is a process. Breast feed as much as you can and use the premade formula (I suggest organic with no corn syrup. If the first ingredient is corn syrup, stay away) so you don't have to mix it. Once maybe is older and doesn't cry before needing to be fed, you can switch to powder which will be way cheaper. Just get one of those protein shaker bottles and it will help mix it really nicely.  *A wave, sound machine goes a long way. You can download an app on your phone or find a video on youtube. Our baby loves the box fan sound. It's 10 hours of a fan running.  *Don't be afraid of germs and all that rubbish. It's not worth the stress. Babies are at their healthiest when they are born and while breastfeeding. Follow the cleaning instructions for bottles and toys but don't worry about germs while it's drying or if something falls on the floor. Babies get dirty. They put their mouth on EVERYTHING. As long as it is MOSTLY clean, you'll be fine. We took our 3 month old to an amusement park!"
daddit,3d4c9k,Navae26,4,Mon Jul 13 21:11:25 2015 UTC,Don't listen to people that say vaccinating is bad or if you don't breast feed you're a bad parent. Those people are stupid.   Also just enjoy every little moment. My girl is just over a year old and I already can't believe where time has gone.
daddit,3d4c9k,reid-o,4,Mon Jul 13 15:39:42 2015 UTC,"To dovetail off this, there are a million things that other parents / random people will judge you for (you'll do it to other parents, too, but try to resist). If you are knowledgeable about the topic and decide how you as parents are going to handle a given situation, then forget what anyone else says or indicates with that smug look of disapproval.   Using formula vs exclusive breastfeeding, when and how you start solid foods, what you feed them, handling sleep training, how and when to punish, daily schedules, and manners / sharing are all big ones I've personally felt and heard others complain about feeling judged. Know the official recommendations, pay attention to what works and doesn't for your family, discuss / decide how you feel about it, and make a plan. Not only will it make you less susceptible to feeling bad when you're (inevitably) judged, it will give you a response if you need one. ""Together with our pediatrician, we decided that this was the best, healthiest plan for our child."""

daddit,3d4c9k,kitaro53085,4,Mon Jul 13 17:08:28 2015 UTC,"Crying is ok. If you treat every whimper as an emergency that must be stopped IMMEDIATELY, you'll drive yourself nuts.  For example, your baby wakes up at night crying, probably for a bottle? Let the baby cry for 30 seconds while you make the bottle, rather than hold the baby while trying to make the bottle with one hand and risk making a mess.  That may seem minor or obvious to some. But it's something that I wish someone had told me."
daddit,3d4c9k,henkiedepenkie,3,Mon Jul 13 19:31:19 2015 UTC,"Don't make too big a deal of the breastfeeding thing. If it does not get going it can be really frustrating. Also formula is a lot more fun for dads, and it allows you to take on a more equal share of the raising business from the start."
daddit,3d4c9k,reid-o,3,Mon Jul 13 14:55:08 2015 UTC,You can bottle feed with breast milk that your wife / partner / baby mama pumped. Totally agree that it's a good way for dad to share the load and get in some bonding time.
daddit,3d4c9k,Vjaa,3,Mon Jul 13 19:03:53 2015 UTC,"Don't try forcing breastfeeding if neither the mother or baby don't want it. While it has its benefits, it's not for every mother and baby.  Don't think they're something wrong if the baby doesn't take to it."
daddit,3d4c9k,RichardBuns,3,Tue Jul 14 00:10:04 2015 UTC,"When registering, ask for the bare essentials (crib, stroller, carseat, maybe a changing table). Don't put a lot of toys on the registry. Ask for diapers and wipes instead. Every one you have ever met that has had a kid will start bombarding you with secondhand toys and clothes. The first couple of weeks are hard. Real hard. Like really fucking hard. You will be running on adrenaline for the first couple of days, but you will get exhausted. Sleep when they sleep. Don't be afraid to ask for help from friends and family.  Remember your partner. PPD is a real thing and it may not be noticeable at first. While being a good dad is important, so is being a good partner. Bring her flowers Get a stuffed animal and take a picture of your kid next to stuffed animal every month. Its amazing to see how fast they grow. They go from blob of baby to kid really fast. Enjoy!"

I think part of it, is because they don't do anything except cry and poop. Just hold on, the first time they smile, or hold your hand will help a bunch."
daddit,3d4c9k,Maclimes,2,Mon Jul 13 13:43:28 2015 UTC,"It REALLY help to ""skin-to-skin"". Take your shirt off, and hold the baby against your chest as they nap or just chill or whatever. I did it, and I swear that immediate connection really helped me."
daddit,3d4c9k,Arhye,2,Mon Jul 13 17:01:34 2015 UTC,"To me the most important thing to remember regarding advice is that EVERY baby is different.  You will get a lot of advice from people about how to handle your child and what to do in certain situations.  I know they're just trying to be helpful but what worked for their kid may not work for yours.  Hell the differences between two of your own will be enough to prove that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to every problem.  So for my piece of advice I would say don't be afraid to try things to sooth your child.  There have been so many times where I felt silly for trying weird things to calm the baby down or get her to sleep.  A couple of times my first one fell asleep in a baby carrier so I thought ""great, a new way to put her down for a nap.""  It worked a couple times but that was it.  During the colicky times we tried gripe water, gas drops, patting, walking, car rides, singing, music, etc. Whatever it took.  Even tried to let her cry it out a few times.  I would have done a rain dance every night if it got her to bed.  Bottom line, there is no right or wrong way to do something so long as you have your child's best interest in mind (and for your own sanity a little bit of your best interest as well)."

daddit,3d4c9k,loworigins,2,Mon Jul 13 20:06:01 2015 UTC,"A friend shared this with me before my daughter was born, so I'll share it with you:  ""I wanted to share something with you that I wish someone had shared with me when I first became a dad. When my son was born I cried. I was happy but then afterward I wasn't overcome by feelings of overwhelming adoration. Don't get me wrong, I really liked the little fella and I know I loved him in a fashion, but not that overwhelming, ""I'd take a bullet for him without thinking twice"" love that mom's describe. It did come after a short time, but not right away and I was thinking there was something very very wrong with me; that this kid had been stuck with some defective dad. My wife on the other hand had that unbelievable adoration. It took me a few moments to realize that she had been feeling him move inside her and had been talking to him and carrying him around for months; to me he was a couple of kicks when I touched my wife's stomach and a fat wife. It only stood to reason she would feel an affection I wouldn't or couldn't. After holding him for hours at a time and playing with him and having him sleep on my chest that adoration came and came like a freight train but until it got there I felt like I had a horrible secret I couldn't tell anyone.  I cannot say whether you are or will go through the same thing, and you don't need to answer this message at all, you have enough stuff to do. I just wanted to share this with you in the off chance that the same thing happens to you because I know the last thing I could possibly do at that point was tell anyone how I was honestly feeling lest they think there was something seriously wrong with me.""  And I will add: Whether it happens the moment you see their head poking out or a few months down the line when they flash that first giant gummy smile when Dad comes in the room- that love really will come crashing down on you like a freight train. Welcome to the club, brother."

We finally got some of those little swaddle me things with the velcro that hold their arms to their side and wrap them up nice and snug.  First night in one of those, he got up once all night.  Second night, he slept all through the night.  Finding those was our first little ""Ok, we can do this"" moment.  Now he is almost 2.5 and in a toddler bed.

A few germs bits of dirt won't hurt. Bonding can be hard for dads. You'll get there."

You won't be able to keep every harm away from her, as hard as it sounds.  Be thankful that (probably) nothing happened to her. You would have noticed changes in her behavior if anything had happened.  So take a deep breath, think about your family, and let the legal system do the rest. Don't throw your life away for that scumbag. Be the better human being. Don't degrade yourself. Be proud of what you achieved. Hug your loved ones.  And if you really cannot cope, search for psychological counseling."

Remember that the world can be dark and cruel, and it will attack your children, and you can't stop it.  But you can prepare them.

(probably not for a few days for most of them - sober dad is the only appropriate dad for the first few days/weeks)  I had a ton of support. But not too many people thought about leisure or luxury activities, only ""get through the next day or two"", and ""make sure he can eat the next week!""  Also one thing that I found especially helpful - someone to act as 'bouncer'. There is always that one friend that loves babies, there are in-laws (sorry, OP, you aren't the most important right now), and all sorts of well-wishers that the happy couple just do not want to deal with - and don't have the time or energy for if they did.  Ask the new parents who that person should be, direct them to turn of their phone (or put on airplane mode or something), and shuffle 100% of all questions and requests for ""can we see the baby yet?!?!?"" towards this bouncer. Good people to be this person are slightly abrasive and down-to-earth, and OK not seeing the baby themselves for a bit - brothers or close cousins, maybe parents, perhaps a very good friend."

They lie around all day either sleeping, eating, or crying and there's not much feedback.  But then little things will happen during their development that will excite you.  They'll start laughing, then sitting up, then crawling.  Their lungs will develop and what was a wimpy cry and murmers turns into a fog horn of a bawl and those coos turn to screams of joy and random noises.  It just keeps going from there.

It doesn't have to be baby talk, just talk to them as if they're another adult in the room. Eventually they'll get bigger and start smiling back and laughing.  Then you're fucking hooked man.

You find yourself doing chores non-stop, constantly changing diapers, feeding, cleaning feeding equipment, cleaning clothes, changing clothes... It just gets tidious. What I recommend for you is to basically invent your own fun. Start reading to him/her, maybe fairy tales or just something you can inflect your voice. Get a baby carrier / moby wrap and take baby around the house and yard, can even get some light housework done that way. We have a stroller with a laying-flat configuration, and that's decent exercise to walk around the neighborhood. And like a book I read points out (Happiest Baby On The Block), the first 3-4 months after birth is really like a fourth trimester where it's almost like baby could still be in the womb. After that time they really start to change and become more interactive. Don't be hard on yourself if you have mixed feelings. I think it's normal. Both my wife and I during new-parent leave had times when we felt we had to just get a away for a bit or were feeling burned out or sad. Happens to everyone."

I wonder if our next will be more instantaneous, but I remember feeling really down about not really having a great strong connection to her in the beginning.   A little long winded to say ""hang in there - about 4 months for me,"" but I didn't speak to many other adults today so I'm letting you have it haha."

Like others have mentioned, they are far more reliant on the mom at this point. It made me feel pretty useless. Doing skin to skin can help. You also work a lot. Think of it as you are doing whatever you gotta do to provide for you child, which is what a loving dad does. Just give it time. In my case, it wasn't until 4 or 5 months that I felt like I was really bonding. Once you make them smile and laugh, its all over. Its a high you'll be chasing for the rest of your life."

I have a 11 year old and a 6 year old both with the same woman.  We split after my first son,  got back together and had another child, then split again......I know right, so no relationship advice but as far as being a single dad , well....... I've been through this twice. Things take time, and eventually you'll have a routine.  Just stick with what you think is right. When you have questions , co-parent,  ask friends,  take a look online , maybe you'll see something that helps. Children at 2 are at a really tough age or there wouldnt be the saying "" the  terrible twos"" - a suggestion , if she puts your child down for a nap a certain way , try to do the same,  Instead of doing it one of the parents certain way , find a common ground. This way your child will be use to a "" nap time "" no matter where he is. I dont pretend to have it all figured out.  What I can tell you is that with Co parenting, as hard as it might be sometimes - communication is the key- my last word advice is - DONT BLINK - because it's going to go by fast. Pretty soon you will be taking pictures of him at the plate for T - Ball then you'll blink again and he will be asking to sleep over a friend's house and eventually you will look back and laugh at this post.

NO is not an effective redirection.   https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=positive%20guidance  I used positive guidance in preschool and in family settings and it works. And the kids begin to learn what they are supposed to do and why (instead of just hearing ""NO"").   18 months is an appropriate time to begin.   Physical redirection is definitely the final, most direct option."

daddit,3d1a0q,citizenfaith,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:18:09 2015 UTC,Do you recommend reading anything in particular?
daddit,3d1a0q,elgarduque,2,Mon Jul 13 01:30:13 2015 UTC,"this summary is pretty decent. http://www.brighthorizons.com/family-resources/e-family-news/2013-alternatives-to-time-out-positive-guidance-tips-for-better-discipline/  The key piece I always bring up is this:  1. if you tell Timmy ""Quit kicking Johnny"", Timmy will just begin punching him instead, And the thing is, Timmy obeyed you - you did not say punching was not OK.    Instead saying something like ""Timmy please keep your arm and legs by yourself"" ""keel your arms and leg away from Johnny"" says that there should be no contact between them two. It precludes alternatives.  Another way is ""Timmy, did you ask Johnny whether he wants to be kicked?"" which allows Timmy to see that Johnny has the right to have control over his own body and Timmy is violating that right. Maybe Johnny said it was OK.    There are other pieces:  1.  Never ask a question instead of saying what you want the child to do.    If you ask a question, ask it in a way where the child's answers are all acceptable (e.g. if you want him / her to pick from three options, present those options).  Giving instructions in the form of a question is super confusing and unfair. Never do it. If you finish a set of instructions with ""OK?"" Your instructions just became a question with a range of acceptable answers. ""No, that is not ok"" is an acceptable answer. Be super consistent, fair, and respectful with rules, and explaining them. For example in preschool we had a tag rule, because of the inherent power dynamic (the kid that is ""it"" is usually an unpopular kid and being ""it"" makes him/her even more powerless). At age 3.5 or so, you get kids challenging this rule, and even offering rule additions to Tag that made the game more fair (e.g. time limits on being ""it"" so everyone get to be the kid without power). The fact that we took the time to explain why tag is a difficult game to play, and why it is not allowed at school allowed the kids to become find solutions how to not step on this rule. So they would propose a rotation of ""it"" and we would enforce it, and stop the game is the rotation did not happen.  I cannot over-stress the importance of giving warnings (actually calling them reminders is even better) and redirect. Let's say a child is hitting another over blocks (remember age 2 is about the most violent we are in our lives). You can give reminders (use your words to ask for blocks. Keep your arms to yourself. Both of you are allowed to have and play with blocks); I prefer 2 reminders + redirection system: (1) Pete, if you cannot use your words to ask for block I will ask you to choose another activity (2) Peter, this is a second reminder. Use your words to ask for blocks. If you have trouble playing with blocks, you will need to choose another activity. (3) Peter, you have trouble playing with Sara today. Please pick another activity; we can try blocks with Sara again tomorrow.""  You gave them plenty of explanation, chance to correct behavior, and then without asking, you told them to go play something else.    An 18 month old will not immediately understand everything, but they will get there and quick."
daddit,3d1a0q,fake_belmondo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:26:11 2015 UTC,With someone that young you pretty much have to physically re-direct them or stop them.
daddit,3d1a0q,warlocktx,3,Sun Jul 12 18:20:58 2015 UTC,Physical redirection does not always mean physical discipline.  Removing the kid or placing him in a new spot or toy is physical redirection.  Couple that with verbal redirection and verbal discipline as appropriate and you will solve many issues at 18 months or so.

daddit,3d1a0q,swampgiant,7,Sun Jul 12 18:30:40 2015 UTC,Your wife should be implementing it equally.
daddit,3d1a0q,fake_belmondo,3,Sun Jul 12 18:41:16 2015 UTC,"you both need the same rules. Saying no to mom should get dad stepping in and vice versa. This is a team sport.   Also -- good parenting is about fair setting and enforcement of rules. You can do this in a way the builds love and respect, yet is not permissive. There is a giant gulf between the autoritarian dad (think 50s, belt beatings, etc) and the permissive parenting of 60s hippies. Be firm, loving, fair, and treat the kid with respect (do not lie, make up things, or change the rules for no reason).   And most of all -- you and your wife need to play together. 100% -- and that is something you need two need to figure out pronto!"
daddit,3d1a0q,ScarfMachine,4,Mon Jul 13 04:47:33 2015 UTC,"No offense... But the kid is only 1.5 years old. You're worrying a bit too much about his emotional state. You're not going to scar him, unless you do so physically. He'll have no memory of any of this... His brain isn't developed enough  He's also only 1.5. That's too young for timeouts or punishment of any kind, he just doesn't get it. It's not that your kid is behind the curve, he's just at an age that he's exploring but doesn't understand; just redirect him away from physical harm."
daddit,3d1a0q,shirtythebear,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:26:33 2015 UTC,At this age he is too young by far to discipline. If he's doing something he shouldn't be just pick him up and redirect his attention.

Skim a book or two on toddler discipline techniques and things will start turning around. Only took us about a week to get our daughter to have a bit better handle on tantrums.   They're supposedly old enough around 9 - 12 months to have understanding around the concept that actions have consequences. They may not know 100%, but 60-75%. That's why positive reinforcement is so effective with little kids."

At age 15mo the word ""no"" is very powerful. at age 20mo punching a peer is very powerful, at age 30mo arguing over rules is powerful and so on ...  hell. .. at age 17y sneaking out of the house is very powerful, at age 30yo embezzling money feels very powerful.   Socialization is the process of defining boundaries for appropriate behavior for the developing person. The context and form changes; the power struggle does not. And yes, that embezzler, probably had parents that either did not give consequences for punching peers at age 2 or gave these consequences inconsistently."
daddit,3d1a0q,BobTheBarbarian,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:43:09 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of great advice from a book on training a puppy:  If your puppy pees on the floor, get a newspaper, roll it up, and hit YOURSELF on the nose.  Seriously, toddlers are just little scientists exploring their world and trying to figure things out.  It's our job to manage their environment to minimize opportunities for failure and maximize chances for success.    ""No!"" is great in those situations where they are doing something really dangerous (grabbing for stove, running into street). Swoop in, pick him up, explain that you love him and why we don't do that dangerous thing.  Over time, it sinks in (my daughter started pointing at candles etc and saying ""fire. Hot. No touch!"")  Otherwise, try to avoid making it a battle of wills or about him needing to obey you. They don't think in those terms.    A great trick to stop a bad behavior is to swoop in, gently but firmly hold his arms and say, ""Jimmy, you're doing [insert thing here like ""picking up the field mice and bopping them on the head.""] We don't do that because [it hurts the poor field mice].  If you want to play with field mice, we pet them gently and give them cheese.  Let's let this field mouse go and [insert redirected behavior here, ie show daddy how many blocks you can stack here.""]   A few other good concepts -   1) give two acceptable choices  (do you want to eat peas or carrots for dinner? Or do you want to take a bath now or in five minutes?)   2) explain what they need to do, and consequence then give a slow three count for them to comply (""please put down that fire axe or daddy will come and put it away. One... Two ... Do you want to put it down or have daddy put it away? ... Three. (Then gently take away the axe and put it away) ... Now quick suggest a good activity (can you help daddy clean his gun collection or cook dinner or whatnot?))  3) find a way to point out minor bad behavior without getting invested in making them stop. Tell them and then remove attention until they stop. ( that doesn't seem like a good decision, that is naughty etc.   Make sure both parents are on the same page.  Aim for a few firm bounDaries so they feel safe and secure and then plenty of freedom to explore within those limits.   Also, if you're super frustrated, put kid in a safe place like crib or with mom and then step outside and take some deep breaths.  Crying for a bit in their crib isn't the end of the world and we're all human and sometimes we need a minute.    Don't worry about mommy being favorite. It will change lots  over time and is really just about them asserting a preference to show independence and them being very tied to routine.   Good luck :)"

daddit,3d1a0q,fake_belmondo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:49:33 2015 UTC,"yes. redirection -- verbal or physical. I am trying to figure out a situation where you would be tempted to count. Let's say ... timmy is kicking tommy. Timmy should not get a count/   ""Timmy keep your body to yourself""  next kick grab leg, Timmy, keep your arms and legs to yourself. Did Tommy ask you to kick him? ""no"" Did Tommy say it would be OK to kick him. ""No"" ... [ keep talking, you stopped the behavior and you are taking their mind off of it.] Be clear about consequences ""You will need to sit on the other side of the table if I have to remind you again to keep your body to yourself.  next kick  Follow through.   I do not see any reason to be tense and count to consequences. I do believe in chances to correct behavior -- giving them reminders about what is wrong with their current actions. In urgent situation, physically stop the behavior explain how they stepped over the line, and physically direct them to a new activity."
daddit,3d1a0q,BobTheBarbarian,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:39:01 2015 UTC,"The whole point of counting (as far as I'm concerned) is to give them a definite time to process the situation/decision and decide what they want to do. It's a choice - I can do what daddy asked or I can do what I want but the consequence will occur.  We try to do it rarely, but it works. You can also song a song ""it's time to get out of the bath. Do you want to get out on your own or have daddy pick you up? Daddy is going to sing the alphabet song and then he is going to pick you up.""   Kicking is not a counting situation.  Refusing to get out of the bath, not giving you the crayon they're using to draw on the walls, etc are pretty good examples.   It's definitely not about begging them to comply. It's just saying they have X time to perform Y action or receive Z related consequence.   Edit: Wanted to add that counting shouldn't be ""tense"" or angry, just a calm countdown so they know how long they have until the consequence occurs.  Kind of like the jeopardy music.  We try really hard to avoid the battle of wills situation ... It shouldn't be about them obeying you or disobeying you.  At 1.5, that might not be a big deal, but at 2.5 with a very spirited kid it's a recipe for disaster.  Also, we want her to be spirited and independent but to also understand that there are boundaries she needs to remain within."

Outside of the sandbox I would think mulch (rubber or wood) would be better than pavers/concrete just for the sake of his hands and knees. Maybe you could hang a toddler swing from the underside of the deck? Again it would be a nice shaded spot for him but there should be plenty of room for a swing to move around.

The  reinforced wall will just hold a small bookshelf/reading nook area for now until she is ready. They grow fast and I want to be sure it will still be entertaining in the future.  The other idea would be to add a water table. Kids love that stuff. I made one that has legs that fold up so we can take it it outside or put it across the bathtub, fun indoors with no mess in the winter. Just from thin pvc pipe and one of those shallow under bed storage totes.  Lastly, if you do get a sandbox be sure it has a lockable cover. It's just a litter box for every animal then."

I just got home from the hospital (I'm only visiting them during the day), and am a bit tired still from the whole shenanigan, but felt like I want to get back to you as I glanced your comment with my phone earlier today.  My wife is recovering really well, and she's already able to get up and walk around a bit without any help. Also, the baby is in really good shape, cries only when there's clearly something that's bothering him, and does breastfeeding amazingly well. I did a lot of stuff there today, from cleaning to changing a diaper to taking off and putting on clothes.  I'm pretty amazed how easily it all comes to me, as I was quite worried that I would feel reluctant to do that stuff or I wouldn't know how. The midwifes have helped and some primal instinct tells me what to do, it's pretty cool. :)  All in all, they're both doing fine and recovering quite fast. They stopped giving epidural to her today, and as the effect wore off, she didn't get any pain whatsoever - only mild discomfort caused by gas, but she got pills for that too.  I wanted to reply to your comment specifically because you said the part that your wife got frustrated because she couldn't help; My wife's really independent and strong-willed, and I know for sure that she'll try to do too much as well. I already told her quite firmly today that I will take care of the stuff and only let her do things if she's 110% sure she can handle it. :]  Oh, and the bed thing: that's good to know. My wife's pretty small (5'1"" I think), but our bed is quite low, so... We'll see how it works out.  All that said, I have a really good feeling about all this.

Here's things I can offer:   take over as much as you can in regards to the baby. Change him, soothe him, let your wife rest as much as she can, but let her do as much as she wants/feels comfortable doing as well.  help and encourage her to walk around the hospital as soon as the doctors recommend it (usually the second day) once you leave the hospital help your wife in remembering her medication schedule. don't be afraid to ask family for help: if that means helping you clean up the house, brining food, running to get stuff from Target that you thought you had enough of but the baby goes through 100x more than you could have ever imagined.    And one thing that helped with MY sanity, if you live close to the hospital, run home and take a shower. You'll be amazed how much more human you feel even with nearly no sleep after a good shower and change of clothes.

I already told a lot of stuff in my other comment, but yours was a nice one that I enjoyed reading as well.  I live really close to the hospital (10-minute bike ride), but I only spend seven hours a day in the hospital. We're quite low on money, so we couldn't afford the family room, so I can only visit them during the visiting hours (12AM-7PM).   Basically I get to eat, sleep and shower at home which makes it a lot more easier for me, and as I go to the hospital, I'm fully energized and can take a better care of both of them. The midwives there are really helpful and skilled as well (albeit a bit understaffed at times), so my wife is in really good hands even when I'm not there. :)  (We also have pets and no relatives living nearby, so I get to take care of them as well.)  Other than that, I've pretty much done all the things you listed. We took a short walk around the halls today (the second day, yesterday was the first day and she got to go to the bathroom with the help of the midwife) and she got up on her feet a couple of times to walk in the room. So far so good, she's recovering really fast and the wound is healing nicely. If everything goes well, they'll be released on Tuesday or Wednesday.  What kind of medication do they give to the mother when we leave the hospital? Is it just pain medication or..? At the moment she's already taking the pain meds in pill form (got the epidural removed earlier today), and some meds to help with her stomach."
daddit,3czvmp,elmatador12,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:40:31 2015 UTC,"Just pain mess, I think my wife had a prescription for about 2 weeks after we left the hospital.   Bummer you can't stay with her at night, but I understand. I don't think we paid for a family room, they just offered me a cot and the baby stayed with us in the room 24/7 unless he was getting weighed or otherwise checked (which was really minimal).   When she's ready to come home just make sure you have everything ready for her so she needs nothing. Remember that her sitting up and standing feels like something is trying to split her apart at the midsection, again, so she will want and NEED assistance.   Enjoy your sleep now, the second that baby is home you'll be waking every 2-3 hours for feeding a, diaper changes and sometimes just a cuddle.   Best of luck, and we're always here for questions, rants and of course cute pictures :)"

daddit,3czvmp,Boston1212,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:20:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah that sounds about right. She was fine until we got home which was about the third day. It's also tough going from in the hospital where everything is taken care of for you, to home where you have to do everything yourself. That's a big change and can be tough while you find a new routine."
daddit,3czvmp,geometrix,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:47:15 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. In the meantime while they're still in the hospital, we try to do as much as we can by ourselves - or rather, I try to do and my wife helps where she can like giving me directions (she's got experience in taking care of babies so it's a bit easier for her, I'm a total newbie). I'll try to make the transition from the hospital to home as smooth as possible. :)"

daddit,3cv7fl,rainman88,62,Sat Jul 11 01:22:33 2015 UTC,"OP here. My daughter has Downs Syndrome. There is a lot of sensitivity/opinions towards this I guess, but it's a reality that we completely accept and we absolutely love everything about her.  Alrighty, so a quick class on terms, jokes, and their acceptability in the DS community:  I make light of it all the time. Mostly to get people to loosen up about it. There's some stuff that's generally not okay to say (you have your freedom to speak as you will, I just ask you to empathize if possible).  Downs Kid, Downer, downs baby, downsie etc.  I don't personally take offense, but many families in the community do. The terms themselves objectify the person with DS in a way that make some people uncomfortable. Honestly, I can see where they're coming from. They don't want their child/brother/sister to be defined by a chromosomal abnormality.   Even Doctors and professionals screw this up. Our first pediatrician referred to her as a ""downs kid."" That was out first and only visit, not because of the words she used, but because it was clear since she used them she had no experience with children with DS. We found a Pediatrician later with tons of experience, and she's awesome.  So - a child with downs, person with Down's syndrome, etc.  Basically anything that takes away the objectification. Call it PC, overly sensitive, or splitting hairs; it's a very real sentiment amongst the DS community that I respect.  You are free to talk as you will. This is the internet, a place I grew up in, so I understand the futility of trying to get people to conform to a way of thinking."

daddit,3cv7fl,dirtyuncleron69,11,Sat Jul 11 14:34:53 2015 UTC,"So, when I was growing up there was a kid a couple years behind me who had Down's. The older kids would always watch out for him, making sure nobody picked on him. It was kinda great. But, we never saw him in public with his family.   One of the biggest feel-good moments I've witnessed lately was at Lowes, where a dad was shopping with his son who appeared to have Down's or a similar chromosomal condition. The boy, maybe 8 or so, was riding on the lumber cart with a big smile on his face. I heard him ask a couple of questions (couldn't really make them out) and the dad answered in what seemed like an incredibly patient and loving way. It was really awesome to see someone, especially this tough guy looking dad, making the effort to include him in his day.   It ain't gonna be easy, OP. But thanks for being a good dad."
daddit,3cv7fl,Hello_Fievel,12,Sat Jul 11 10:57:10 2015 UTC,"First, thank you for being there for that child.   Luckily I think the attitudes toward it are changing. A few decades ago we probably would have been advised to put her in an institution. Now the big thing is integration, because people with DS are much more capable than people previously assumed.  I've met people in their 40s who are completely independent, have jobs, romantic relationships, and a few who even have a drivers license.  There's obviously the other side though. Some are debilitated by it. However, this is often the result of the systemic medical issues that often accompany the disability. Heart defects occur in 60% of kids with DS, many who have to be corrected by surgery while they are infants. Infants under general anesthesia is NEVER good, and brain trauma is a very real possibility. In these kids you have a situation about which came first, the chicken or the egg? Are they delayed because of the DS? Or are they delayed from the injuries sustained during corrective surgery? So, it gets complicated.  The spectrum of the developmental delays is HUGE, so much so that it's impossible to predict how a child will turn out. Even then you still have to ask the question: is it nature?  Or is it nurture? Yes, delays are inevitable, but some are a result of the effort that is put into them. Some kids have it rough, with families who give up right away or don't care."
daddit,3cv7fl,Hello_Fievel,5,Sat Jul 11 11:12:26 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've got a good attitude about things, which in the end is probably all any parent can do.  You can't change who your kids are, for better or worse, just have fun and support them the best you can."
daddit,3cv7fl,Hello_Fievel,15,Sat Jul 11 10:48:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, accepting her is the easiest part. It's trying to have compassion for the world around her that doesn't understand that's the hard part. It's hard to judge others though, 2 years ago I was a guy who said he could never take care of a child with special needs, and here I am totally content with it. Life is weird."

As for the heart defects, we lucked out. She hasn't had a single issue so far. Hearing, sight, sleep apnea, sleep issues, heart problems, intestinal problems, all of them she has dodged completely. We are incredibly lucky to have such an easy child.  She just started walking (20 months), which is awesome. She communicates very well, but with ASL. We noticed she will probably have some issues with expressive language, so we got the signing started early. I can have basic conversations with her already, which is a HUGE mental boost for my wife and I. We get to talk with our daughter, and it's pretty awesome."
daddit,3cv7fl,cicalino,3,Sat Jul 11 14:30:50 2015 UTC,"ASL  will also help bring along her language development in the future.  We signed from the get go too and it was really paid off now that my daughter has started talking. No joke, her communication abilities are ahead of non-disabled peers.  The problem will always be enunciation though and speech therapy helps with that.  We had open heart surgery, central apnea and had to wait 4 full years before we walked.  It was a rough ride for sure, but she and I have a special bond now.  It's too bad guys like us don't have a sub on here."

Have her sleep quality checked soon. Almost every kiddo with Downs has sleep apnea to some degree and there is research out there suggesting it has a significant impact on IQ. Like 10 points or so. Keep her active. Obesity rates are higher with Downs than without and weight loss later in life is very hard. Get her used to good nutrition and exercise habits early. This is obviously true for any kid, but Downs just makes them more susceptible.    On a more personal note - she's adorable!"

daddit,3cv7fl,jester8484,4,Sat Jul 11 07:28:33 2015 UTC,Wow I didn't know it was possible to miss a chromosome. How does it affect her?
daddit,3cv7fl,Muchachi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:37:43 2015 UTC,"It's a condition known as Turner's Syndrome. My sister's case is a bit unique in that she lost the X chromosome part way through development. As such, she has a lot more normal features than most, but still has the mind of roughly an 8 year old."

daddit,3cv7fl,adamb0mb,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:59:49 2015 UTC,"Since op is so helpful maybe he has the inside on this question.  The extra chromosome in question, do all humans with it have the same one or are there different extra chromosomes that change how a person behaves or looks?"
daddit,3cv7fl,colp4k,2,Sat Jul 11 12:02:40 2015 UTC,"Downs Syndrome is also called Trisomy 21.   It means these kids have an entire extra copy, or just a extra portion of their 21st chromosome pair. It causes a plethora of potential issues. Most commonly heart defects, and gastrointestinal. They exhibit common facial characteristics (almond shaped eyes, lack of a nosebridge, etc.)  There are other chromosomal abnormalities, but they aren't Downs. There's trisomy 13 or trisomy 18. Kids with trisomy 13 don't live very long, 80% don't survive to age one. I'm not too familiar with the others.  Sorry if my explanation is short. The daughter just woke up and wants pancakes!"

daddit,3cxswe,c435087,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:46:08 2015 UTC,I'm a respiratory therapist. I work with kids and adults who have cystic fibrosis. You can PM me of you want/ feel comfortable with that.   Edit: false positives with the newborn screen blood test can happen and somewhat frequently. The sweat chloride test is the standard and needs to be done twice for confirmation
daddit,3cxswe,breatheasy14,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:36:47 2015 UTC,"Got a positive test for galactosemia off the newborn screen. It was not a false positive, she really has it. We're very thankful for the newborn screen though, things would have gone bad fast without it.   They did say that some of them are false positives. Mostly due to damage to the sample during transit.   I hope yours is a false positive."

daddit,3cx1th,staticprevails5,3,Sat Jul 11 15:08:39 2015 UTC,"If you were perfect, how would your little girl ever grow to find her own strength?  Try your best, try to improve, be better, but remember to be kind to yourself as well as your family. Try to enjoy the process, enjoy watching her learn and grow. Enjoy watching yourself learn and grow, because none of us will ever be perfect."
daddit,3cx1th,failon,2,Sat Jul 11 18:38:34 2015 UTC,You are the best man in the world for your child. No other could ever fill your shoes the way you do. Remember that and ignore any other notion of uselessness.
daddit,3cx1th,buckstop7,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more with this. My son is two months old, and I too feel the same sometimes. One thing I've learned is to trust your spouse and don't think about ""what if"". Live in the present and enjoy your family, the good and the bad.  Pic of me and my son this morning: http://i.imgur.com/VlLeqAR.jpg"
daddit,3cx1th,c435087,2,Sat Jul 11 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"I mean let's be honest, you may not be good enough for either of them. That's not admitting anything other than reality. There is no cosmic ""love conquers all"" force at play here.  So what to do? I work hard to understand the areas where I think I can do more, be more, try harder, be better. Recognize your faults and work hard to remember that they exist and that they require your attention to counter. No one is perfect, and the humility that comes with that realization is enlightening."
daddit,3cx1th,Jaskix,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:54:30 2015 UTC,"This is a feeling I feel everyday, but honestly, it does no good so I push it out.    The only advice I ever received that I remember after my child was born, came from an old guy who's last kid just left their home a month before. He told me something so small and stupid, and I'll never forget it, because it changed my whole outlook on shit. I remember he looked at me holding my daughter (who I'm just, absolutely infatuated with) and he gets kinda teary eyed and he said ""Always hold her. Hold her as much as you can, whenever you can, wherever you can. When she is older, she will always remember that"". And, at the time I just sort of politely nodded, and smiled at him. But, about 6 weeks after having our daughter, I was up at 3:35am, (she didn't sleep through the night for the first 15 months), and I remember sitting there with her in my knees, exhausted, angry, irritated, and I remember her looking at me, and giving me the first smile I'd ever seen from her. She looked SO happy. And I just stopped, and I remembered what that guy said. And from that moment on, I just resolved to do one thing: To love her. That's all you can do as a Dad. All you can really do is love your children. From that moment on, I've cherished every single exhausting, tiring, infuriating, and amazing moment with her. I hold her whenever I can, and I just find that my attitude is different now.    I don't know where it will go. I'm sure she will turn into a bratty little kid, then an obnoxious teenager. But I'm resolved to just being a loving father. i will guide her the best I can, and I will try to encourage her, and keep her from being a complete fuck up. But ultimately, the only real power a parent has is love. So, even if she winds up being a murderous druggie bitch one day. At least I'll know it wasn't because her dad didn't love her. And I have complete faith and hope in love. I think it will be ok.     TL;DR. All any dad can do is love their children more than themselves. Do this, and you are already a better dad than most."

daddit,3cwrff,Killfile,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"The ""out"" bit is cute but, to hear most of my gay friends tell it, don't do that. Coming out to your parents is a formative part of the definition of sexual identity.   Be accepting, be supportive, be loving parents but let your kid make their own announcement, even if you know.   It's like a surprise party; even if you know it's polite to be surprised"
daddit,3cwrff,RentonBrax,2,Sat Jul 11 18:43:17 2015 UTC,I rekon a dad knows how to deal with his kid in that situation. I'd say do what you think is best rather than try to apply any kind of rule.
