CatholicMemes,3dmrj4,dadarknight,4,Sat Jul 18 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"You touch upon a very common objection to God's existence or his goodness.  It does seem arbitrary and cruel for God to allow Job, or anyone, to suffer.  However, I think the key to understanding this apparent cruelty is to humbly acknowledge the limits of our knowledge of the universe ... as God points out to Job ... ""where were you Job? .... what do you really know? .... ""  Appearances can be deceiving and some of our greatest achievements are born of struggle and suffering.  The Catholic understanding of suffering is that God only allows / permits (never inflicts) suffering because he intends to bring out an even greater good that could never have happened without the suffering.  We often resent God because we see suffering as the worst thing that could ever happen, but God doesn't really see it that way.  Sin is the absolute worst thing that could happen.  If great struggle and suffering are necessary to purge away sin and obtain greatness, then so be it.  Oftentimes we are unable to see the good things that are a result of our perceived misfortunes and only blame God for the evil that he allowed to spring upon us.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=287&v=JvCfoCB4ffU  http://blog.adw.org/2015/02/triumph-is-born-out-of-struggle-an-important-truth-as-seen-in-a-movie-outtake-of-bruce-almighty/  I thought this clip from Bruce Almighty really hit the nail on the head.

CatholicMemes,3bwv3d,iamhdr,2,Fri Jul 3 17:05:35 2015 UTC,"The catechism states    1901 If authority belongs to the order established by God, ""the choice of the political regime and the appointment of rulers are left to the free decision of the citizens.""  The diversity of political regimes is morally acceptable, provided they serve the legitimate good of the communities that adopt them. Regimes whose nature is contrary to the natural law, to the public order, and to the fundamental rights of persons cannot achieve the common good of the nations on which they have been imposed.    The common origin of ""separation of church and state"" stems from a letter Jefferson wrote to quell concerns from some Baptists that the US government would impose itself and form a state sponsored church and restrict the practice of others.  Currently, the most common opposition to ""religious ideas"" like real marriage between a man a woman, anti-abortion, non-participation in contraception and such is backed by those that don't want us to ""impose our religion on them"" and use the phrase separation of church and state to imply that the involvement of the religious into state affairs is somehow unconstitutional or just plain wrong. Catholics are bound by our faith to ensure, as much as possible, that government is operating in accord with Natural Law."
CatholicMemes,3bwv3d,elperroborrachotoo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"Of course, the phrase has a wide range of intrpretations and understandings.   One could go back to ""Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.""  I see the core idea as separation the organization of government from the organization of churches, and that neither has power over the other.   There are certainly various ways to achieve that - there are some certain requirements, such as financial separation; it also follows that public schools should not favor one religion or another.   For the latter it seems easiest - but not necessarily best - to exclude religion from public schools. Whether that e.g. means teachers have to hide their affiliation is a quite divisive topic in Germany - even among the unaffiliated.     As for marriage:  I am totally OK with how the German model works out. There's the state marriage which decides your status regarding tax breaks, default status of children, inheritance defaults etc. And then you can marry at your church. I have friends for whome the ""state"" marriage was a brief formality of under 15 minutes with just their closest family, and a warm, grand almost lavish wedding at their church with all their friends and family - affiliated or not. Other friends had a no less beautiful tear-jerking ceremony at the state wedding.   In this case gay marriage would be up to both the state and each and every church.   It's only been since 2009 that a religous wedding is possible without being married by the state; the state offers gays only registered partnerships which have some but not all benefits of a state marriage (which sucks). And of course it's up to churches whether they are willing to marry gays."

I see the core idea as separation the organization of government from the organization of churches, and that neither has power over the other.   The fundamental problem with your position is that in the US specifically (as well as many other countries) we,  collectively, are Ceasar. There is no singular dictator imposing unjust &  immoral precepts to us. Because our government is a government of the people, it is completely immoral to accept laws that are opposed to the Natural Law.

No, the proper role of government is to help people and by directing them towards the good. People are still free to rape, murder and steal but we impose consequences to those actions.

I think that in view of the impending distress it is well for a person to remain as he is. Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek marriage. But if you marry, you do not sin, and if a girl marries she does not sin. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that. I mean, brethren, the appointed time has grown very short; from now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none, and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods, and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the form of this world is passing away. I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how “to please the Lord; but the married man is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please his wife, and his interests are divided. And the unmarried woman or virgin is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit; but the married woman is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please her husband. I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.”  1 Corinthians 7:25-35"

However, if I've been told correctly, part of being a recovering alcoholic is practicing restraint when exposed to other people drinking or seeing it on a beer commercial. I'm not a recovering alcoholic, so I couldn't possibly understand, but I have been around a few and people have said, ""Oh I shouldn't be drinking around you!"" or something to that effect, and they always say that it's fine and it's actually good practice for them, for lack of a better term.  Of course, because of this passage I still would not drink around them.

CatholicMemes,35ph3l,ElectronicGeek,4,Tue May 12 21:56:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but this wasn't just a temporal statement. Every day we choose sin instead of God (myself definitely included), but some of the members of that sub think that some sins are morally ok, which makes no sense."

Cain didn't realize God wanted the blood of Christ represented in the Old Testament prophetically in the lamb sacrifices (this is why Christ is known as the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world). You are right, we must come God's way, what God calls sin is sin and we must recognize it, otherwise we end up like Cain. And yes, we do all sin, this is why confession is good. But the idea is to not be enslaved to sin by loving God and our neighbor through the power of the Holy Spirit, asking for this power through prayer (see John 14). These ""Christians"" never read the scriptures (oh sure, they stay in the green zones), so they never have to deal with 1 John 3:  ""9 No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 10 By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother."""

CatholicMemes,35h58m,CATHOLIC_EXTREMIST,6,Sun May 10 08:38:31 2015 UTC,"There's a kernel of truth here, but it's a poor general rule.  If followed consistently,   Thomas Aquinas never should have started utlilizing Aristotelian philosophy.  Why follow this trendy Islamic fad?  Keep it safe with classic neo-Platonism, etc. Even more, Harnack was right and Christians should have never started utilizing Greek philosophy at all!  ""What has Athens to do with Jerusalem,"" amirite Tertuliian? Western Christians should have never started using Latin in the liturgy -- I mean, c'mon, the litrugies of the Apostolic Fathers were predominately said in Greek; heck, the New Testament was almost entirely composed in Greek!  Love it or leave it, Romans. For that matter, Christians shouldn't have been using Greek in the first place -- Jesus and his core disciples spoke Aramaic!  The Syrians, now they are the hardcore, legit Christians! On that note, Paul shouldn't have been pushing for Gentile Christianity either and the ""Council of Jerusalem"" (Acts 15) totally screwed things up!  If the Greeks aren't willing keep kosher, circumcise their sons, etc., tough luck -- the world hates Jesus and his movement after all, that the movement was, most originally, Jewish through and through.   I think St. Paul himself gave a much better rule of thumb: ""test everything; hold fast to what is good"" (1Thess 5:21)."

CatholicMemes,35h58m,Nulono,4,Sun May 10 16:18:07 2015 UTC,"Christians and specifically Catholics believe that our religion is the religion not because of a martyrdom of Christ. Those who do are inherently misguided because of at least two reasons: 1) Catholicism is the largest religion by number of adherents. Just by the numbers game Christianity shouldn't be the most hated religions on earth. 2) The most important part is that we believe Christ is risen! He lives and ultimately doesn't care so much whether he is hated nor if Christians are hated. We are the seed to be the change of this world.  It may seem that I go against this meme. However, I only do so as much as that it's not our primary goal to be hated. It's a side-effect and often dangerous or even lethal. Still, the primary objective is to love God, then love yourself as you love others. The part of being hated is several steps further down the line."
