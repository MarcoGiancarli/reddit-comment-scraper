StarcraftCirclejerk,3e1szb,Default1355,5,Tue Jul 21 12:26:30 2015 UTC,"...really?  Well, first off, everyone plays the weakest race, no matter who you talk to. Every time. Second, as part of the Nathanias rant about protoss a while back I think it was pointed out that Protoss is built to win with ""gimmicky,"" and all-in, play, and some people (like MC...iirc) learned to really capitalize that. And people HATE playing against it, because when done properly it feels like there is nothing you can do to stop it. And usually there isn't.  Third, the salt. Everyone wants to complain. Especially about balance. I'd wager that most people that balance whine just aren't good enough to either play at their level anymore or aren't good enough to move on with their rank. Or they keep losing to the same thing over and over again and either A) refuse to learn how to counter it, or B) don't want to learn, and just want it to go away.  For example, both of my vs Terran matchups. I fucking hate widow mines. I feel they are so stupid and, while they CAN be micro'd, you don't always have to. You can just burrow and they will kill things. And if there isn't detection... well that's probably game. A year ago ZvT was a big limiting factor for me, and I thought that the skill ceiling on my side of the matchup was too high for my level (mid diamond) compared to theirs. So I learned an all-in that hit quick and decided the game before even the 10 minute mark. I didn't feel like playing macro ZvT anymore, partly because it no longer felt playable. This is after my ZvT felt god-tier, because Terrans felt so predictable and easy to play against, whether I won or not (although I usually did). Then everything changed when the widow mines attacked...  That all-in in that matchup helped push me to the very top of Diamond, edging Masters (back when it was top 2%). I wasn't actually learning anything about the matchup, but I was still winning. Fast forward to a year later (a season or two ago) and I want to start playing again. Instead of hitting a brick wall with zerg again I pick up Protoss, which I haven't played since the end of WoL. Guess what I find annoys the piss out of me as protoss...... fucking widow mines. For all the same reasons, except this time I have a lot less units and every kill hurts real bad. I tried to learn how to play macro and defensive against terran bullshit, but it didn't work. Learned another early all-in that won me far, far, far many more games than I legitimately deserved. But I got the promotion, so who cares.  This subbreddit, and TL, and twitch chat, and everywhere, is filled with racial hate (damn racists) because people would rather whine about the game than try to learn to be better at it. It's easier. I did it. Twice even. Except instead of whining on message boards I whined with my builds.  There are people out there that will accuse each race of a-moving to victory, with no micro required. It's stupid, and people are stupid. So if you still wonder why people whine about their race being underpowered and each other race being overpowered, it's because whining is easier than getting better. And each race has its stereotypes when it comes to easy ways to win.  Hell (warning, you could infer spoilers ahead), I'm watching Starleague right now and just saw the Flash vs herO game. I won't spoil it, but regardless of who won I definitely feel there was a lot of bullshit that determined who won that game. And with all the stereotypes out there, either of them could have taken the victory based on that feeling."

StarcraftCirclejerk,3dtce6,User_Simulator,2,Mon Jul 20 07:46:57 2015 UTC,"Well thought out and written post, here is my feedback.  On the Pylons, what if instead of another energy bar for warp-ins it just used the pylons shield energy instead, using a number of energy per unit warped. When it runs out you can't warp in anything.  Now to augment the fact that the pylon might be attacked or depleted with warp-ins why not give the sentry a spell that uses energy to replenish shields (that could or could not be used on both buildings and units).  I always thought force field was a defensive spell so why not remove it from the sentry and give it to the mother ship core, or the nexus. With the new sentry energy spell your regular buildings now become force fields anyway, that is until you run out of energy or there is enough units to kill the building anyway.  Keep up the good work!"
StarcraftCirclejerk,3dtce6,Default1355,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:36:46 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?"

StarcraftCirclejerk,3d4m7h,Excellentee,5,Mon Jul 13 14:11:13 2015 UTC,"TLO also has the best trivia on all of liquipedia  Considers Snute to be the most handsome progamer in Europe.[Citation needed]  Played Protoss in Brood War.  Has severe Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in both wrists.  Got his nickname (TLO stands for ""TheLittleOne"") from playing 2v2 in Supreme Commander with his older brother ""TheBigOne"". His big brother uses the nickname ""TheBigOne"" despite being shorter.  Was given the nickname ""NostraDario"" (reference to Nostradamus) for his predictive nuke that killed many of Hyperdub's Vikings in the 2010 TG Sambo Intel StarCraft II Open Season 1.  TLO was a member of Germany's national team - Team Germany.  TLO originally played StarCraft II under the nickname of ""TheLittleOne"" as mentioned above, but as this was shortened by fans to ""TLO"", he preferred the shortened version.  TLO played Random throughout most of beta, then switched to Terran for early release. Later he switched to Zerg for a very brief amount of time, before switching back to random, then Terran again. For Battle in Berlin, he switched to Zerg again. Since then he has stated multiple times, that he does not plan to switch races again.[Citation needed]  He became the first and only player to win an episode of the weekly ZOTAC Cup while playing as random.  Is a noted fan of the series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.[15] At the start of 2012, he stated numerous times on his stream that   he would not shave his beard until he placed exceptionally well or  outright won a tournament. He finally shaved his beard in May 2012.[16]  His beard has a fanclub.  While living in Korea, he adopted an abandoned kitty that he named Spot. He found the cat when he was going out for dinner in the streets.  Once had Day9 send him a shipment of sand to impress a girl. Day9 was very amused when he heard that TLO's try failed.[17]"

Every post that involves starcraft has you and a small handful of people shit-talk him. You must be really jealous of him to make these statements. It's a good thing you aren't relevant at all in the eSports scene like starcraft is because you are what's wrong with the video game community and people in general. I hope you take a long look in the mirror and do some soul-searching because your attitude is not going to get you far in life.

If you think that's too much to pay, you are just being a selfish community memeber and are not truly appreciating the extra hard work carbot and his wife have put into this project.

StarcraftCirclejerk,3bcqfz,BallisSTLife,3,Sat Jun 27 23:53:04 2015 UTC,"First, there’s a common misconception that after all the changes we’re implementing as we transition from Heart of the Swarm to Legacy of the Void, we’re planning to make the game completely different with each patch after release. When we say the game will change with each patch, we’re referring to the big picture. When you compare Heart of the Swarm to the current state of Legacy of the Void, the changes are profound. This means we need even more time testing and iterating to make sure that these major changes work well. Completely remaking the game with each patch is impossible—what we’re saying is that we will continue to iterate on major changes with future patches, and these changes will have a great impact on the game. We’re definitely not saying we won’t be trying new, big things in the beta—we clearly are and will continue to do so. But we need to spend a lot more time working on, testing, and polishing the huge changes we’ve already implemented, and although it may be more fun to only try crazy new things that would make the game completely different, that’s not the purpose of this beta."
StarcraftCirclejerk,3bcqfz,FizzSc2,3,Sun Jun 28 01:41:16 2015 UTC,"I appreciate what you're saying, but whats important to me is reinforcing good behavior whenever I see it. Do something right? I'm gonna give you a damn cookie. I don't see it as blind optimism but I do think it's important to recognize the small steps forward. Look at it this way: this whole community is stirred up, and it's in large part Blizzard's fault for staying out of the conversation for so long at a pivotal time, but if we want them to come back to the table and talk to us it's only going to help if we're happy to have them back (rather than remaining bitter that they left)."

StarcraftCirclejerk,3a5vys,RiskyChris,2,Thu Jun 18 11:20:53 2015 UTC,So your contention is that starcraft was dead on arrival? The game that launched twitch and was the biggest esport for quite a while.  I think a am unclear on what this subreddit is about. Is the title ironic and actually for people that want to bash sc2. Not trolling. I came to here because of all the negativity in the other reddits and was curious.
StarcraftCirclejerk,3a5vys,RiskyChris,2,Thu Jun 18 15:48:04 2015 UTC,"you're really cute lol  Did you read the modmail I sent you? It gave a brief overview of what's going on here.  If you'll remember, Battle.net 2.0 launched with WoL, and it was a disaster.  Custom games never got off the ground, impressive considering BW/WC3's history.  KeSPA was also not a part of SC2 from the beginning, which was part of the reason Blizzard never managed to leverage the legacy of BW into making SC2 thrive in Korea.  Those are two things that started SC2 off immediately on the wrong foot.  Then you continue on into a game that due to a rough start and shaky vision from Blizzard started to drift and stagnate.  I'd say the peak of the glory days personally was around mid 2012 when we still had foreigners backpacking it in Korea for glory, but even that was unsustainable.  GSL despite their best efforts couldn't continue.  Then enter WCS, a slapped together mess of a system that literally killed the GSL, and gutted the Korean scene.  You have the hardest working esports personalities in the world seeing money drained from their scene in order to what, pay some Code Z white guys with 100 apm across the globe?  You have Koreans flying out of Korea to participate in these leagues -- where has the best league gone?  It doesn't exist anymore.  Add to all this a client and game meta that changed less since WoL than Dota does over the course of a year, and you get the current state of affairs for a lot of fans.    Now, you can still like starcraft unconditionally.  You'll probably get sass a bit around here, but that's because this sub is full of starcraft fans who really just wanted more from their favorite franchise.  If this place comes off as bashing SC2, that's because a lot of us are jaded after years of waiting and hoping and wishing, and for many of us -- contributing. Personally I've paid hundreds of dollars to tournament orgs in tickets over the years.  At the end of the day it's a circlejerk subreddit, so you do you.  Just remember, TLO ;)"

In short term, seeing someone passionate distributes the mood to the person next to you. All negativity is to throw in the bin. We may have been upset with Blizzard or anything for X or Y, they are our evolution hope from this current stage to the one we want to have for StarCraft. Join all the chats, talk to me, I can be found on the Reddit group in game, SC2Improve as well and it will be back up to point one and five. Keep on playing the game. When I say playing, I mean actively playing. Arcade, FFA, 4v4 and if you're brave 1v1 ! If you have bits of money, I refer to the adult part of the community, just subscribe or follow to known channels such as GSL. Who wants GSL to disappear ? No one. Look for Crowdfunding causes as well such as HomeStory Cup. Suggest ideas, propose projects, promote projects and realise them. Double Harvest model for example is a change we all want to try, such as StarBow. Those are values to the game. They are the kind of jewel we polish to their brightest point."
StarcraftCirclejerk,3a1btz,BallisSTLife,4,Tue Jun 16 15:04:56 2015 UTC,"I like your optimism and will try and do some of the stuff mentioned in your post since I recently started playing again but there is one thing I want to talk about for a bit  All negativity is to throw in the bin.  We may have been upset with Blizzard or anything for X or Y, they are our evolution hope from this current stage to the one we want to have for StarCraft. This is going to be hard. Blizzard has been making some bad decisions with the direction LotV is taking and we should be able to let our opinions about that be heard. If we don't say anything stuff we don't think is good for the game will be implemented which might affect player numbers even more then it does right now. I know none of us here know exactly what's right and wrong for this game at the moment but if we don't say anything I don't think it will help too much Also, I feel like I have to remind you this is reddit. This site and especially this community has always been a place for negativity when there is a chance to show it. Hopefully this can be turned around but I honestly can't say the chances of that happening are very big."

We made balance suggestions, they didn't care. We made improvement suggestions, the didn't care. We rage now on Reddit, they just don't care.  So if it would be just a bad engine, Blizzard shouldn't use it for heroes and neither for lotv and develop something new. Well this is my opinion, nice post OP, upTLO'd!"
StarcraftCirclejerk,39sec3,Lapai,5,Sun Jun 14 11:08:31 2015 UTC,"First question is: who do you want to make the game better for? Casuals or veteran players? If you want to attract casuals and make them stay, you can't expect skins and tournaments to do that. It won't magically make them want to grind 1v1 just because ""lel derp ultra skin lel xD"". We need a better UI and complete rework on some mechanics like the XP. We can even go as far as making speedruns in Campaign have some meaning or have daily quests similar to other games. Invent a currency and with that currency unlock skins, bonus campaign missions or improve your profile page somehow (similar to Steam profile upgrades where you unlock additional infos). There are many things they could add to improve the casual experience without hindering core gameplay.  If you want to make the game better for the hardcore players tho, thats entirely different topic. I've played lotv and it's definitely better than hots in many ways. Except some of the unit designs kind of suck. The lurker is atrocious and so are the 2 new terran units. They are trying to make protoss feel more like sc1 protoss but I can't say how well that's been going so far."

Luckily I am pretty familiar with Totodile_'s conditioin; I can't count the number on my hand how many times I've had to administer the insulin pump into his vein. In short of showing up there myself, I did the next best thing which is calling 911. Hopefully you can be there too when your friend is in need.

However, as his behavior continued I knew that it had taken a much more morbid turn. Luckily I am pretty familiar with Totodile_'s conditioin; I can't count the number on my hand how many times I've had to administer the insulin pump into his vein. In short of showing up there myself, I did the next best thing which is calling 911. Hopefully you can be there too when your friend is in need. This is why I don't use the word ""faggot"" or ""autist"" because I always want to appear friendly and amicable to anyone in need of hand and those tend to be gays and people with autism."

StarcraftCirclejerk,39fobl,Default1355,7,Thu Jun 11 12:51:18 2015 UTC,"Reddit is fucking dead in my mind and this announcement confirmed it for me. It's quite sad, I remember first visiting before making an account around 9 years ago and it was a bastion for intelligent tech conversation. Soon Reddit evolved into a social website but maintained its independence from other bottom feeding Web 2.0 sites. Sean Plott is rolling in his grave at this garbage and the CEO who is installing it.  Does Geoff Robinson count as an individual? Because if you're going to go down this dark path, you have a LOT of subreddits to ban. Geoff Robinson got harassed worse than anyone I've ever seen on Reddit, far worse than any fat person being harassed by /r/starcraft (which they didn't actually do). What you're doing is setting a precedent which cannot possibly be enforced except by the caprice of Admins . . . and I think that's EXACTLY what you want. If the subreddit was ""/r/leagueoflegends"" there's no way you would have banned it. You're making a choice that you care more about fat people as a group than members of Riot Games (or any other group that is widely hated) and by Administrators making a personal choice as to what is supported and what is not, you're doing far more risk to Reddit than you could possibly remove by banning /r/starcraft. I hope you realize what you're doing. I don't think you do."

StarcraftCirclejerk,398b04,Depops_au,4,Wed Jun 10 02:58:09 2015 UTC,"One time I answered and it was a really sweet Korean girl selling GSL subscriptions. I told her I wasn't interested because My dad works for blizzard (yeah I know, reddit hates him). Anyway, She thanked me for being so friendly too her and told me that she took the job to try to learn dank memes but that it was a weird experience for her because she was very shy.  She asked if she could come back and I told her she could. She came back a few times and had a 3-way with my sister and I. That was really the only time I ever had a nice experience with a door to door sales person."
StarcraftCirclejerk,398b04,Default1355,3,Wed Jun 10 06:17:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I completely agree. I totally bought some tickets to that one guy with superior musicality's piano concert the other weekend. He actually is a friend of mine and has repeatedly told me he could easily have gotten accepted to Julliard if, in the audition, they'd have been more lenient with his technical deficiencies and focused more on his innate musicality. My friend was always lauded by everybody, from a very young age, for his musicality and his musical intuition. But while other kids were put in programs where they were made to drill their scales and their technique for hours upon hours, my friend rejected traditional schooling and mindless practice in the interest of preserving his uniquely superior intuition. I always thought it was unfair that pianists like Evgeny Kissin got to play in prime venues for sold out crowds while my friend, who by all accounts is innately more musical, is struggling to promote himself. It feels like in order to have a chance to break into the scene you have to have practiced and drilled your technique 8 hours a day, for every day since you were at least 6 years old. After his audition my friend actually submitted a motion to the board of Julliard, requesting every auditionee be given enough time to ensure they were satisfied with their performance before any judgement was passed. Apparently the board denied the motion with some rather vague reasoning and motives such as ""at the minimum [expecting] a technically proficient rendition"". This led to my friend immediately giving up piano altogether (as people are wont to do in every discipline where professional execution is unattainable). As fate would have it my friend was also a very talented chess player and athlete throughout his childhood. As a kid he was touted as a prodigy and won several regional chess tournaments. Although later in adolescence he gave up chess as it became clear to him that chess rewarded the study and rote memorization of openings and positions over innate strategic ability and what he considered his superior tactical intuition. After the Carlsen-Anand FIDE finals my friend had a renewed interested in Chess again. He loves Viswanathan Anand and cheers for him. Recently my friend discovered some scientific studies suggesting that chess players' cognitive abilities and stamina decline with age. Naturally, he found it intensely unfair that one player should be favored in a chess game only due to said players' ability to perform more mental calculations over a set time period. Of course this lead to a petition and a motion, submitted to FIDE, where my friend requested time controls in FIDE competitions to be adjusted for age related cognitive decline. Unfortunately the petition failed to gain traction as most people didn't take his ideas seriously and dismissed them out of hand. I mentioned my friend was a rather talented athlete. In his childhood years he showed great promise as a basketball player and later also in football. Though he became aversely inclined against the both sports when coaches began demanding strength building exercises and condition training runs of him. He felt college teams and the higher competitive leagues weren't inclusive and accepting enough for people like him, and that really put off all his enjoyment for the sport. With basketball, already at an early stage, my friend told me he had a revelation where (in addition to all the above) since he wasn't projecting growing tall enough and since he wasn't black (sic), he'd be left with an unfair disadvantage. And that was the exact moment when the sport of basketball become unfun for him and he quit the game altogether (both watching and playing). I don't really know why I just told you my friend's life story. In fact, the way this was written you may falsely have been led to believe my friend didn't amount to nothing. But I'll have you know my friend is actually quite successful. He currently works as a game designer for a major company and designs esports games for a living. It's an arena where he gets a chance to use his knowledge and experience to decide and re-define why audiences like watching sports and performance arts."

You can't scientifically measure liev/ded and people just like yourself can get offended over the smallest thing and feel so much ladder anxiety that you want to be able to play as protoss. Fuck you. Want to go take a ride on the waaaarp gate mechanics? Grow a backbone and figure out that your protoss deathball is not a special flower that everyone else must tiptoe around.

StarcraftCirclejerk,382a1q,BallisSTLife,2,Mon Jun 1 14:06:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I completely agree. I totally bought some tickets to that one guy with superior musicality's piano concert the other weekend. He actually is a friend of mine and has repeatedly told me he could easily have gotten accepted to Julliard if, in the audition, they'd have been more lenient with his technical deficiencies and focused more on his innate musicality.  My friend was always lauded by everybody, from a very young age, for his musicality and his musical intuition. But while other kids were put in programs where they were made to drill their scales and their technique for hours upon hours, my friend rejected traditional schooling and mindless practice in the interest of preserving his uniquely superior intuition.  I always thought it was unfair that pianists like Evgeny Kissin got to play in prime venues for sold out crowds while my friend, who by all accounts is innately more musical, is struggling to promote himself. It feels like in order to have a chance to break into the scene you have to have practiced and drilled your technique 8 hours a day, for every day since you were at least 6 years old.  After his audition my friend actually submitted a motion to the board of Julliard, requesting every auditionee be given enough time to ensure they were satisfied with their performance before any judgement was passed. Apparently the board denied the motion with some rather vague reasoning and motives such as ""at the minimum [expecting] a technically proficient rendition"".  This led to my friend immediately giving up piano altogether (as people are wont to do in every discipline where professional execution is unattainable).  As fate would have it my friend was also a very talented chess player and athlete throughout his childhood. As a kid he was touted as a prodigy and won several regional chess tournaments. Although later in adolescence he gave up chess as it became clear to him that chess rewarded the study and rote memorization of openings and positions over innate strategic ability and what he considered his superior tactical intuition.  After the Carlsen-Anand FIDE finals my friend had a renewed interested in Chess again. He loves Viswanathan Anand and cheers for him. Recently my friend discovered some scientific studies suggesting that chess players' cognitive abilities and stamina decline with age. Naturally, he found it intensely unfair that one player should be favored in a chess game only due to said players' ability to perform more mental calculations over a set time period.  Of course this lead to a petition and a motion, submitted to FIDE, where my friend requested time controls in FIDE competitions to be adjusted for age related cognitive decline. Unfortunately the petition failed to gain traction as most people didn't take his ideas seriously and dismissed them out of hand.  I mentioned my friend was a rather talented athlete. In his childhood years he showed great promise as a basketball player and later also in football. Though he became aversely inclined against the both sports when coaches began demanding strength building exercises and condition training runs of him. He felt college teams and the higher competitive leagues weren't inclusive and accepting enough for people like him, and that really put off all his enjoyment for the sport. With basketball, already at an early stage, my friend told me he had a revelation where (in addition to all the above) since he wasn't projecting growing tall enough and since he wasn't black (sic), he'd be left with an unfair disadvantage. And that was the exact moment when the sport of basketball become unfun for him and he quit the game altogether (both watching and playing).  I don't really know why I just told you my friend's life story. In fact, the way this was written you may falsely have been led to believe my friend didn't amount to nothing.  But I'll have you know my friend is actually quite successful. He currently works as a game designer for a major company and designs esports games for a living. It's an arena where he gets a chance to use his knowledge and experience to decide and re-define why audiences like watching sports and performance arts."

StarcraftCirclejerk,37smmm,BallisSTLife,6,Sat May 30 02:00:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I completely agree. I totally bought some tickets to that one guy with superior musicality's piano concert the other weekend. He actually is a friend of mine and has repeatedly told me he could easily have gotten accepted to Julliard if, in the audition, they'd have been more lenient with his technical deficiencies and focused more on his innate musicality.  My friend was always lauded by everybody, from a very young age, for his musicality and his musical intuition. But while other kids were put in programs where they were made to drill their scales and their technique for hours upon hours, my friend rejected traditional schooling and mindless practice in the interest of preserving his uniquely superior intuition.  I always thought it was unfair that pianists like Evgeny Kissin got to play in prime venues for sold out crowds while my friend, who by all accounts is innately more musical, is struggling to promote himself. It feels like in order to have a chance to break into the scene you have to have practiced and drilled your technique 8 hours a day, for every day since you were at least 6 years old.  After his audition my friend actually submitted a motion to the board of Julliard, requesting every auditionee be given enough time to ensure they were satisfied with their performance before any judgement was passed. Apparently the board denied the motion with some rather vague reasoning and motives such as ""at the minimum [expecting] a technically proficient rendition"".  This led to my friend immediately giving up piano altogether (as people are wont to do in every discipline where professional execution is unattainable).  As fate would have it my friend was also a very talented chess player and athlete throughout his childhood. As a kid he was touted as a prodigy and won several regional chess tournaments. Although later in adolescence he gave up chess as it became clear to him that chess rewarded the study and rote memorization of openings and positions over innate strategic ability and what he considered his superior tactical intuition.  After the Carlsen-Anand FIDE finals my friend had a renewed interested in Chess again. He loves Viswanathan Anand and cheers for him. Recently my friend discovered some scientific studies suggesting that chess players' cognitive abilities and stamina decline with age. Naturally, he found it intensely unfair that one player should be favored in a chess game only due to said players' ability to perform more mental calculations over a set time period.  Of course this lead to a petition and a motion, submitted to FIDE, where my friend requested time controls in FIDE competitions to be adjusted for age related cognitive decline. Unfortunately the petition failed to gain traction as most people didn't take his ideas seriously and dismissed them out of hand.  I mentioned my friend was a rather talented athlete. In his childhood years he showed great promise as a basketball player and later also in football. Though he became aversely inclined against the both sports when coaches began demanding strength building exercises and condition training runs of him. He felt college teams and the higher competitive leagues weren't inclusive and accepting enough for people like him, and that really put off all his enjoyment for the sport. With basketball, already at an early stage, my friend told me he had a revelation where (in addition to all the above) since he wasn't projecting growing tall enough and since he wasn't black (sic), he'd be left with an unfair disadvantage. And that was the exact moment when the sport of basketball become unfun for him and he quit the game altogether (both watching and playing).  I don't really know why I just told you my friend's life story. In fact, the way this was written you may falsely have been led to believe my friend didn't amount to nothing.  But I'll have you know my friend is actually quite successful. He currently works as a game designer for a major company and designs esports games for a living. It's an arena where he gets a chance to use his knowledge and experience to decide and re-define why audiences like watching sports and performance arts."

He actually is a friend of mine and has repeatedly told me he could easily have gotten accepted to Julliard if, in the audition, they'd have been more lenient with his technical deficiencies and focused more on his innate musicality. My friend was always lauded by everybody, from a very young age, for his musicality and his musical intuition. But while other kids were put in programs where they were made to drill their scales and their technique for hours upon hours, my friend rejected traditional schooling and mindless practice in the interest of preserving his uniquely superior intuition. I always thought it was unfair that pianists like Evgeny Kissin got to play in prime venues for sold out crowds while my friend, who by all accounts is innately more musical, is struggling to promote himself. It feels like in order to have a chance to break into the scene you have to have practiced and drilled your technique 8 hours a day, for every day since you were at least 6 years old. After his audition my friend actually submitted a motion to the board of Julliard, requesting every auditionee be given enough time to ensure they were satisfied with their performance before any judgement was passed. Apparently the board denied the motion with some rather vague reasoning and motives such as ""at the minimum [expecting] a technically proficient rendition"". This led to my friend immediately giving up piano altogether (as people are wont to do in every discipline where professional execution is unattainable). As fate would have it my friend was also a very talented chess player and athlete throughout his childhood. As a kid he was touted as a prodigy and won several regional chess tournaments. Although later in adolescence he gave up chess as it became clear to him that chess rewarded the study and rote memorization of openings and positions over innate strategic ability and what he considered his superior tactical intuition. After the Carlsen-Anand FIDE finals my friend had a renewed interested in Chess again. He loves Viswanathan Anand and cheers for him. Recently my friend discovered some scientific studies suggesting that chess players' cognitive abilities and stamina decline with age. Naturally, he found it intensely unfair that one player should be favored in a chess game only due to said players' ability to perform more mental calculations over a set time period. Of course this lead to a petition and a motion, submitted to FIDE, where my friend requested time controls in FIDE competitions to be adjusted for age related cognitive decline. Unfortunately the petition failed to gain traction as most people didn't take his ideas seriously and dismissed them out of hand. I mentioned my friend was a rather talented athlete. In his childhood years he showed great promise as a basketball player and later also in football. Though he became aversely inclined against the both sports when coaches began demanding strength building exercises and condition training runs of him. He felt college teams and the higher competitive leagues weren't inclusive and accepting enough for people like him, and that really put off all his enjoyment for the sport. With basketball, already at an early stage, my friend told me he had a revelation where (in addition to all the above) since he wasn't projecting growing tall enough and since he wasn't black (sic), he'd be left with an unfair disadvantage. And that was the exact moment when the sport of basketball become unfun for him and he quit the game altogether (both watching and playing). I don't really know why I just told you my friend's life story. In fact, the way this was written you may falsely have been led to believe my friend didn't amount to nothing. But I'll have you know my friend is actually quite successful. He currently works as a game designer for a major company and designs esports games for a living. It's an arena where he gets a chance to use his knowledge and experience to decide and re-define why audiences like watching sports and performance arts."

StarcraftCirclejerk,37j296,Default1355,6,Thu May 28 02:59:51 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?"
StarcraftCirclejerk,37j296,MetastableToChaos,3,Thu May 28 10:23:50 2015 UTC,"I want to say something before this whole thing gets out of control. In 1967, in the hot desert sun, a woman gave birth to a boy in the back of old pick up. She was a whore. She left the boy at a local church. The father at the church didn't like children, but he knew that being a disciple of the bible he couldn't possibly not take the small kid. Instead he ended up taking out his frustration on the boy. At the age of three, the boy was forced to use the toilet. Let me tell you the little fell into his own pile of poop more than once. By the age of 5, the boy the boy was reading the bible and chopping wood for the fire. Despite the father's harsh character, the boy loved him and thought of him as his true father. By the age of seven the father raped him three times. The boy ran away. He survived four days in the desert by eating cactus and scorpions. He was finally found by a drug cartel boss, who took the boy in. Mr. Sanchez was his name, and he was immediately impressed by the boys intelligence and grown up attitude. Mr. Sanchez provided the boy with an education at a private prep school and a nice house. The boy had sex for the first time when he was 12, the next year he graduated high school. He was the school's star running back. The boy was lost, although he liked Mr. Sanchez, he never thought of him as his father. The boy went to India, were he became a spiritual leader of a large tribe of farmers. With his power he turned the several plots that each tribe member had into a large corporate farm and became a millionaire. His assets grew as he bought into other successful start ups. He often got ahead in business with his great leadership abilities, but once in a while he used violence. This was India after all. By the time he was 22, the boy had all the money he would ever need. So he bought a yacht and traveled the world for 10 years. For 10 years he visited every major port, slept with girls from every country imaginable, and tried every drug ever made (by nature and by man). When he was 33, he was walking on a beach in French Guiana when he met a girl of Irish - Native American decent. She bared his seed. It was boy, perfect health. He moved them to Argentina, then London, and eventually Vermont. The man was 45 now, he has seen everything, accomplished everything, tried everything. He skied down the Swiss Alps, been at the North Pole, swam with hammerheads, everything! Yet he has never done one simple thing that we all take for granted every day, he met his father. He never played catch with his father, he never talked about women with his father. He never would. He died at the age of 63 when his parachute didn?t open when he was base jumping from Dagger Mountain in Washington, USA. Over three thousand people attended his funeral.  I know what you are thinking. How does this story relate to me? Well I want you to go all the way back to the beginning of the story and remember the woman who gave birth to this incredible boy. You are like this woman. You are like this women because you are a whore."

StarcraftCirclejerk,37j296,MetastableToChaos,2,Thu May 28 14:12:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess I'll take all night talking about it.  For starters, I've been playing Starcraft ever since it came out. I was 13 during its release (August/September) and 14 soon after (October). I've been an avid RTS gamer all my life - first game was Age of Empires 2, later Age of Empires 3, the original Starcraft, Warcraft, etc. I played at a local LAN in Vancouver at the age of 14 at diamond league and reached masters league at 15 years old. I'm 18 now, and have since ""quit"" Starcraft, in a sense.  I see so many people here saying that ""those who quit don't really like SC2"" anyways. They're so wrong, in so many ways - I've spent bus rides staring at Starcraft apps, to the point of memorizing how much damage every single unit can take, how much health each unit has, doing battle simulations on my head. I drew pylons whenever I was in class and thought of SC2 non-stop. I dreamt Starcraft dreams and played SC2 exclusively everyday. Even when LoL was on the rise, I played SC2 and actively promoted it. I played during class (in CADD) and I played during lunchtime. I did exhibition 1v3s against my noob friends at school to show what SC2 is capable of so others would be interested in getting good at the game. I watched SC2 religiously and was super excited for HotS, snuck on to watch Blizzcon during class, and could describe any player in the GSL from personality to playstyle. I loved Starcraft II back then, and I still do now.  But I quit. The reason why I quit was simple - Blizzard stopped caring - about the game, about the community, about the player. I think the beginning of WoL was great - we had MarineKing with the name Boxer living up the legacy with great marine control, we had the Polt vs Jinro 'drama' and the foreign hopes in both Idra and Jinro. It was a golden time for Starcraft. Probably the greatest time was 2010 Blizzcon Finals with Mvp vs Nestea, with nukes on Shakuras Plateau - I remember the hype, and John the Translator's speech.  Then what happened? 4gates for PvP throughout the entire history of WoL. The imbalanced time of 1/1/1s. Later in WoL, Broodlord Infestor turtling. Protoss turtling.  Remember when Sniper won a GSL, after doing mass infestors and mass fungal against Ryung (refresher: IMBA IMBA IMBA IMBA IMBA), somehow coming back from an impossible game? Remember when the top 4 in multiple tournaments were all Zergs? Remember when Blizzard patched that only... 3 months later, despite nerfing Ghosts snipe damage two days before one of the biggest MLGs? The inconsistency in balance patches resulted in perhaps one of the longest one-race-dominated time in Starcraft's history, that being Zerg at the time. But there's no need to dwell in the past - this was the past, surely after the community outcry, Blizzard has gotten better at listening to the players, right?  Nope.  The community has told Blizzard what we want multiple times. I'm sure Blizzard knows the importance of community feedback. Not every idea is great, no, but if everyone agrees with an idea, it's generally a good idea to add it for the players so they'll be happy. Blizzard takes a slightly different approach.  We have an extreme amount of posts detailing the design failures of the Battle.net 2.0 interface, to no changes. We've asked that you can name your lobbies like the original Starcraft - nothing's changed. Make the game feel more alive with auto-connect chat lobbies and so forth. Nothing. We want an Abathur voice pack, nope. Unit skins? They added them, yes - and never added any new ones since the beginning of HotS. Clan wars? Nah, we'll wait till the next game. More team game support - nope. Ban maphackers. Still no official reply. Swarmhosts are boring. Only took several months before they addressed it, and they're still working on a fix! We've told Blizzard a ton of times we're willing to throw our money at them in Starcraft if they're willing to add unit skins or voice packs - and they're not doing it! I'm done waiting for Blizzard to have their interface have as much features as their original game from '98, and I'm done waiting for Blizzard to ""ban in waves"" (or so they say), and I'm done waiting for Blizzard to reject my money then report to the higher ups ""Starcraft can only make money on initial sale"".  While this next point may be up for debate, I would say that the player experience is the most important aspect of any game. If you look at Blizzard as a Hearthstone player or World of Warcraft player, you really feel the sense that Blizzard cares about you as a customer, and actively tries to make the game better for you (whether they actually do do that or not, that's a different story). That's why they changed the auction house in Diablo III. That's why they're adding expansion packs for Hearthstone and a new expansion for WoW every two years that changes everything up with balance patches, completely new content, and so forth.  As a Starcraft player, do you know what I get? Late balance patches. Maphackers ravaging the ladder. The idea that I have to win 50 games in order to get placed in freakin diamond. An interface that hardly connects me with anyone. ""Clans"" that can't do anything outside of make announcements for clan wars which are hosted in lobbies that aren't customizable. A poorly run WCS with late rulesets after the tournament already started.  On top of that, the fact that I have to win 50 games in a row to get back to platinum from gold is absolutely sickening. I don't see how getting a player to commit an entire day of grinding pointless ladder games was a good choice by them, but they continue to stick by it. If anything, it's a greater deterrent for any ex-diamond players who wanted to play one or two ladder matches before dinner (eg. me), because they know that those games aren't even going to be a challenge. Furthermore - the fact that they spent time on revamping the MMR system (which wasn't even originally terrible, just a couple minor tweaks would've done it) only meant less time they had to work on just about everything else the community asked for. Priorities, Blizzard.  The game isn't dead by any means, no. Starcraft still has the greatest number of interesting personalities and drama, there's still tons of tournaments, and lots of pros still play it. But I can't help but get frustrated as a player, at all the decisions that Blizzard has made over the years - the lack of support, the late patches (that were sometimes pointless, like eg. bunker time 30 -> 35 -> 30 -> 35 or oracle speed changes four times), the lack of care and quality that Blizzard is known for. It frustrates me to no end that Starcraft, the game I love, could've been so much more - that being good at the game and the ridiculous amount of skill and practice it takes actually meant something; that it could've been the number one game on Twitch in terms of viewership; that people would flock to stadium to watch one of the greatest, most competitive, high stakes game ever created - but Blizzard just flat out didn't care. Originally a diehard fan, years of Blizzard's wishy-washiness and lack of commitment to Starcraft II just makes me feel hollow inside.  Yes, I agree with Nazgul's post as in the community should not be so negative all the time. ""ded gaem"" is not contributing positively in anyway. But I do believe that criticism, in general, for Blizzard is needed - in every game, the ones that are the biggest fans should be the biggest criticizers. I believe that over the past few weeks or so, Blizzard has been trying - their latest post was certainly a reassurance that they're at least attempting new things - but if they don't continue to work on the game even after Legacy of the Void comes out, I don't see SC2 lasting for the long run.  TL;DR - I don't feel like Blizzard cares about what Starcraft II is up to, and couldn't care less if it dies. Their stubborness in some of their design philosophies, late patches, constant problems, map hackers rampaging ladder, inconsistancies and not really caring about the community makes it so I just don't want to support a game with all those problems. I mean, even Riot, with much less money, posts lore stories, balance patches every so often (with a complete redesign every season or so), things fans have made, host art contests, and generally attempt to get feedback from all their players - and uses their feedback in future patches.  I acknowledge that I've been wanting to write this for a while, and as such my bottled-up emotions may have led me to state certain things with a slight bias. I believe that my points, generally, are objectively true but of course, my opinion of Blizzard is an opinion. I just want to speak for the players who quit for similar reasons like mine, and perhaps if Blizzard is reading this, do something about it. Because seriously, I really want SC2 to succeed.  note: I still play this game, but casually with friends in 2v2s and 4v4s. I also watch it quite regularly whenever there are some good names."

StarcraftCirclejerk,37fn34,EGMEMESTERRC,4,Wed May 27 07:36:18 2015 UTC,Since following these accounts on twitter last week my stage 3 cancer progressed to stage 4 :(
StarcraftCirclejerk,37fn34,LLLukeJ,-1,Wed May 27 07:56:30 2015 UTC,I'm glad we can help you!
StarcraftCirclejerk,37fn34,Default1355,1 point,Wed May 27 08:02:15 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?"

He allows his opponents victory because he is a loving god creator. He creates the gods us mere dimensional creation beings worship blindly.

""another level"" implies TLO is in the same league as his understudies. in reality, tlo isn't confined to even the same dimension, or any ""plain of existence"" as we know it.  4) By those ignorant of his glory. Unfortunately, they only hold themselves back from TLO's Great Promise.  5) Tlo's past is one shrouded in mystery. Just how did our universe become created? Was it TLO's first accomplishment, or simply a whim based off his random perplexion at the time?  6) Only TLO can predict the future, as he created it, long ago. He shall continue to reign supreme from the place of non-existence and unlimitation, his self-invented homeland. This place is sometimes mistaken for heaven, although it is not, as this is where angels go when they pass on to the next life."

While this is a new blog, we've seen many of these points brought up before and have discussed them with development. We know these requests are important to the community and we're always looking to make sure that hot topics such as these are given the appropriate amount of attention internally.

I don't want to believe everyone was right all this time to an extent.  I have moved on past the accusations for months, almost years since people gave them any real credence. I have even begun to regard them in a completely joking manner.  I'm going to be cliche as fuck here. Real talk. I have thought about, I've gone so far as to even look up viewbotting sites (especially after being viewbotted blatantly before). I would never go as far as this.  I've had insane growth since I went full time thanks to just hundreds, not thousands of viewers. I've had the best year of my life probably. FUCK.  Is there a possibility of viewbots being automatically turned on whenever I turn on my channel. How many are there. Is it happening when I stream on NVIDIA too?

StarcraftCirclejerk,34mah4,Zerran,3,Sat May 2 17:42:12 2015 UTC,wow another hair-brained idea from the COMMUNITY
StarcraftCirclejerk,34mah4,i_am_thomas,5,Sat May 2 16:27:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess I'll take all night talking about it. For starters, I've been playing Starcraft ever since it came out. I was 13 during its release (August/September) and 14 soon after (October). I've been an avid RTS gamer all my life - first game was Age of Empires 2, later Age of Empires 3, the original Starcraft, Warcraft, etc. I played at a local LAN in Vancouver at the age of 14 at diamond league and reached masters league at 15 years old. I'm 18 now, and have since ""quit"" Starcraft, in a sense. I see so many people here saying that ""those who quit don't really like SC2"" anyways. They're so wrong, in so many ways - I've spent bus rides staring at Starcraft apps, to the point of memorizing how much damage every single unit can take, how much health each unit has, doing battle simulations on my head. I drew pylons whenever I was in class and thought of SC2 non-stop. I dreamt Starcraft dreams and played SC2 exclusively everyday. Even when LoL was on the rise, I played SC2 and actively promoted it. I played during class (in CADD) and I played during lunchtime. I did exhibition 1v3s against my noob friends at school to show what SC2 is capable of so others would be interested in getting good at the game. I watched SC2 religiously and was super excited for HotS, snuck on to watch Blizzcon during class, and could describe any player in the GSL from personality to playstyle. I loved Starcraft II back then, and I still do now. But I quit. The reason why I quit was simple - Blizzard stopped caring - about the game, about the community, about the player. I think the beginning of WoL was great - we had MarineKing with the name Boxer living up the legacy with great marine control, we had the Polt vs Jinro 'drama' and the foreign hopes in both Idra and Jinro. It was a golden time for Starcraft. Probably the greatest time was 2010 Blizzcon Finals with Mvp vs Nestea, with nukes on Shakuras Plateau - I remember the hype, and John the Translator's speech. Then what happened? 4gates for PvP throughout the entire history of WoL. The imbalanced time of 1/1/1s. Later in WoL, Broodlord Infestor turtling. Protoss turtling. Remember when Sniper won a GSL, after doing mass infestors and mass fungal against Ryung (refresher: IMBA IMBA IMBA IMBA IMBA), somehow coming back from an impossible game? Remember when the top 4 in multiple tournaments were all Zergs? Remember when Blizzard patched that only... 3 months later, despite nerfing Ghosts snipe damage two days before one of the biggest MLGs? The inconsistency in balance patches resulted in perhaps one of the longest one-race-dominated time in Starcraft's history, that being Zerg at the time. But there's no need to dwell in the past - this was the past, surely after the community outcry, Blizzard has gotten better at listening to the players, right? Nope. The community has told Blizzard what we want multiple times. I'm sure Blizzard knows the importance of community feedback. Not every idea is great, no, but if everyone agrees with an idea, it's generally a good idea to add it for the players so they'll be happy. Blizzard takes a slightly different approach. We have an extreme amount of posts detailing the design failures of the Battle.net 2.0 interface, to no changes. We've asked that you can name your lobbies like the original Starcraft - nothing's changed. Make the game feel more alive with auto-connect chat lobbies and so forth. Nothing. We want an Abathur voice pack, nope. Unit skins? They added them, yes - and never added any new ones since the beginning of HotS. Clan wars? Nah, we'll wait till the next game. More team game support - nope. Ban maphackers. Still no official reply. Swarmhosts are boring. Only took several months before they addressed it, and they're still working on a fix! We've told Blizzard a ton of times we're willing to throw our money at them in Starcraft if they're willing to add unit skins or voice packs - and they're not doing it! I'm done waiting for Blizzard to have their interface have as much features as their original game from '98, and I'm done waiting for Blizzard to ""ban in waves"" (or so they say), and I'm done waiting for Blizzard to reject my money then report to the higher ups ""Starcraft can only make money on initial sale"". While this next point may be up for debate, I would say that the player experience is the most important aspect of any game. If you look at Blizzard as a Hearthstone player or World of Warcraft player, you really feel the sense that Blizzard cares about you as a customer, and actively tries to make the game better for you (whether they actually do do that or not, that's a different story). That's why they changed the auction house in Diablo III. That's why they're adding expansion packs for Hearthstone and a new expansion for WoW every two years that changes everything up with balance patches, completely new content, and so forth. As a Starcraft player, do you know what I get? Late balance patches. Maphackers ravaging the ladder. The idea that I have to win 50 games in order to get placed in freakin diamond. An interface that hardly connects me with anyone. ""Clans"" that can't do anything outside of make announcements for clan wars which are hosted in lobbies that aren't customizable. A poorly run WCS with late rulesets after the tournament already started. On top of that, the fact that I have to win 50 games in a row to get back to platinum from gold is absolutely sickening. I don't see how getting a player to commit an entire day of grinding pointless ladder games was a good choice by them, but they continue to stick by it. If anything, it's a greater deterrent for any ex-diamond players who wanted to play one or two ladder matches before dinner (eg. me), because they know that those games aren't even going to be a challenge. Furthermore - the fact that they spent time on revamping the MMR system (which wasn't even originally terrible, just a couple minor tweaks would've done it) only meant less time they had to work on just about everything else the community asked for. Priorities, Blizzard. The game isn't dead by any means, no. Starcraft still has the greatest number of interesting personalities and drama, there's still tons of tournaments, and lots of pros still play it. But I can't help but get frustrated as a player, at all the decisions that Blizzard has made over the years - the lack of support, the late patches (that were sometimes pointless, like eg. bunker time 30 -> 35 -> 30 -> 35 or oracle speed changes four times), the lack of care and quality that Blizzard is known for. It frustrates me to no end that Starcraft, the game I love, could've been so much more - that being good at the game and the ridiculous amount of skill and practice it takes actually meant something; that it could've been the number one game on Twitch in terms of viewership; that people would flock to stadium to watch one of the greatest, most competitive, high stakes game ever created - but Blizzard just flat out didn't care. Originally a diehard fan, years of Blizzard's wishy-washiness and lack of commitment to Starcraft II just makes me feel hollow inside. Yes, I agree with Nazgul's post as in the community should not be so negative all the time. ""ded gaem"" is not contributing positively in anyway. But I do believe that criticism, in general, for Blizzard is needed - in every game, the ones that are the biggest fans should be the biggest criticizers. I believe that over the past few weeks or so, Blizzard has been trying - their latest post was certainly a reassurance that they're at least attempting new things - but if they don't continue to work on the game even after Legacy of the Void comes out, I don't see SC2 lasting for the long run. TL;DR - I don't feel like Blizzard cares about what Starcraft II is up to, and couldn't care less if it dies. Their stubborness in some of their design philosophies, late patches, constant problems, map hackers rampaging ladder, inconsistancies and not really caring about the community makes it so I just don't want to support a game with all those problems. I mean, even Riot, with much less money, posts lore stories, balance patches every so often (with a complete redesign every season or so), things fans have made, host art contests, and generally attempt to get feedback from all their players - and uses their feedback in future patches. I acknowledge that I've been wanting to write this for a while, and as such my bottled-up emotions may have led me to state certain things with a slight bias. I believe that my points, generally, are objectively true but of course, my opinion of Blizzard is an opinion. I just want to speak for the players who quit for similar reasons like mine, and perhaps if Blizzard is reading this, do something about it. Because seriously, I really want SC2 to succeed. note: I still play this game, but casually with friends in 2v2s and 4v4s. I also watch it quite regularly whenever there are some good names."

StarcraftCirclejerk,332b3t,drbeavi5,9,Sat Apr 18 21:02:23 2015 UTC,"Dude, Blizzard is garbage. They're one of the absolute worst game developers, Hearthstone is a children version of Yu-Gi-Oh, WoW has been dying since 2005 because 50% of everything Blizzard does is incorrect, Starcraft 2 is a non-f2p multiplayer game and therefore shit, and Heroes of the Storm should've been released 7 years ago, now it's far too late. Source: I bought Diablo 3 on day 1, fuck Blizzard, I hate them so much. I will never preorder again, MK10 was the last time. I swear. Ok, maybe next assasins creed, I trust in Ubisoft to not fuck me over, but after that I'm finished."
StarcraftCirclejerk,332b3t,Zerran,10,Sat Apr 18 21:50:02 2015 UTC,"The hate for Blizzard is strong in this one. If you post this on /r/starcraft enough, you are bound to get the attention of the executive management, forcing them to bow down to the mighty power of the upvote. They will realize that they are wrong and that F2P games are the only way to go."
StarcraftCirclejerk,332b3t,Zerran,8,Sat Apr 18 22:04:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The Starcraft community is the most important source of feedback for Blizzard. Where else would Blizzard get any new ideas from? Their employees don't have brains, we already concluded that, so it must be from one of their communities. The average Hearthstone player is 4.63 years old, WoW players are lifeless addicts, Diablo 3 is a console game. Starcraft on the other hand consists mostly of law graduates with an an IQ of 155, and it has more active players than Lost Vikings and Rock'n'Roll racing combined."
StarcraftCirclejerk,332b3t,Redrot,7,Sat Apr 18 22:19:34 2015 UTC,lol you trust ubisoft to not fuck you over? good luck with that one theyre even worse than hitlerzzard
StarcraftCirclejerk,332b3t,Zerran,7,Sat Apr 18 23:29:42 2015 UTC,"no. are you kidding me? Ubisoft, EA, Uwe Boll... they stand for quality. Their next releases will be good, I preordered all of them. Because... you know... preordering is advantageous... because...... mmmh. shut up. It's my money. I do what I want with it. Go away with your logic. Fuck you, video games are just a hobby, leave me alone, it's my money, I know with 100% certainty that they will be good. Shut up. MY MONEY MY MONEY 100% MY MONEY MY GUARANTEED 10/10 MONEY MY MONEY MY MONEY MY MONEY SHUT UP. Go kill yourself. You're such a pathetic annoying nerd, if you want to be as cool as me turn off your brain and do whatever advertisment tells you."

Not just because it lampoons a post on the front page of /r/starcraft by accessing an established sccj meme, but because THIS VIDEO WAS FUCKING UPLOADED TODAY. This post would have been good enough if you dug up some old video, but the planets aligned so this post could happen. In 200 years when the church of TLO is piecing together ancient manuscripts to make a new holy book, this day will feature prominently and will probably be celebrated by a holiday where friends and family give each other colourful birdhouses and toast marshmallows over a fire fuelled by last year's birdhouses."

StarcraftCirclejerk,31lx7o,MetastableToChaos,4,Mon Apr 6 10:10:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess I'll take all night talking about it.  For starters, I've been playing Starcraft ever since it came out. I was 13 during its release (August/September) and 14 soon after (October). I've been an avid RTS gamer all my life - first game was Age of Empires 2, later Age of Empires 3, the original Starcraft, Warcraft, etc. I played at a local LAN in Vancouver at the age of 14 at diamond league and reached masters league at 15 years old. I'm 18 now, and have since ""quit"" Starcraft, in a sense.  I see so many people here saying that ""those who quit don't really like SC2"" anyways. They're so wrong, in so many ways - I've spent bus rides staring at Starcraft apps, to the point of memorizing how much damage every single unit can take, how much health each unit has, doing battle simulations on my head. I drew pylons whenever I was in class and thought of SC2 non-stop. I dreamt Starcraft dreams and played SC2 exclusively everyday. Even when LoL was on the rise, I played SC2 and actively promoted it. I played during class (in CADD) and I played during lunchtime. I did exhibition 1v3s against my noob friends at school to show what SC2 is capable of so others would be interested in getting good at the game. I watched SC2 religiously and was super excited for HotS, snuck on to watch Blizzcon during class, and could describe any player in the GSL from personality to playstyle. I loved Starcraft II back then, and I still do now.  But I quit. The reason why I quit was simple - Blizzard stopped caring - about the game, about the community, about the player. I think the beginning of WoL was great - we had MarineKing with the name Boxer living up the legacy with great marine control, we had the Polt vs Jinro 'drama' and the foreign hopes in both Idra and Jinro. It was a golden time for Starcraft. Probably the greatest time was 2010 Blizzcon Finals with Mvp vs Nestea, with nukes on Shakuras Plateau - I remember the hype, and John the Translator's speech.  Then what happened? 4gates for PvP throughout the entire history of WoL. The imbalanced time of 1/1/1s. Later in WoL, Broodlord Infestor turtling. Protoss turtling.  Remember when Sniper won a GSL, after doing mass infestors and mass fungal against Ryung (refresher: IMBA IMBA IMBA IMBA IMBA), somehow coming back from an impossible game? Remember when the top 4 in multiple tournaments were all Zergs? Remember when Blizzard patched that only... 3 months later, despite nerfing Ghosts snipe damage two days before one of the biggest MLGs? The inconsistency in balance patches resulted in perhaps one of the longest one-race-dominated time in Starcraft's history, that being Zerg at the time. But there's no need to dwell in the past - this was the past, surely after the community outcry, Blizzard has gotten better at listening to the players, right?  Nope.  The community has told Blizzard what we want multiple times. I'm sure Blizzard knows the importance of community feedback. Not every idea is great, no, but if everyone agrees with an idea, it's generally a good idea to add it for the players so they'll be happy. Blizzard takes a slightly different approach.  We have an extreme amount of posts detailing the design failures of the Battle.net 2.0 interface, to no changes. We've asked that you can name your lobbies like the original Starcraft - nothing's changed. Make the game feel more alive with auto-connect chat lobbies and so forth. Nothing. We want an Abathur voice pack, nope. Unit skins? They added them, yes - and never added any new ones since the beginning of HotS. Clan wars? Nah, we'll wait till the next game. More team game support - nope. Ban maphackers. Still no official reply. Swarmhosts are boring. Only took several months before they addressed it, and they're still working on a fix! We've told Blizzard a ton of times we're willing to throw our money at them in Starcraft if they're willing to add unit skins or voice packs - and they're not doing it! I'm done waiting for Blizzard to have their interface have as much features as their original game from '98, and I'm done waiting for Blizzard to ""ban in waves"" (or so they say), and I'm done waiting for Blizzard to reject my money then report to the higher ups ""Starcraft can only make money on initial sale"".  While this next point may be up for debate, I would say that the player experience is the most important aspect of any game. If you look at Blizzard as a Hearthstone player or World of Warcraft player, you really feel the sense that Blizzard cares about you as a customer, and actively tries to make the game better for you (whether they actually do do that or not, that's a different story). That's why they changed the auction house in Diablo III. That's why they're adding expansion packs for Hearthstone and a new expansion for WoW every two years that changes everything up with balance patches, completely new content, and so forth.  As a Starcraft player, do you know what I get? Late balance patches. Maphackers ravaging the ladder. The idea that I have to win 50 games in order to get placed in freakin diamond. An interface that hardly connects me with anyone. ""Clans"" that can't do anything outside of make announcements for clan wars which are hosted in lobbies that aren't customizable. A poorly run WCS with late rulesets after the tournament already started.  On top of that, the fact that I have to win 50 games in a row to get back to platinum from gold is absolutely sickening. I don't see how getting a player to commit an entire day of grinding pointless ladder games was a good choice by them, but they continue to stick by it. If anything, it's a greater deterrent for any ex-diamond players who wanted to play one or two ladder matches before dinner (eg. me), because they know that those games aren't even going to be a challenge. Furthermore - the fact that they spent time on revamping the MMR system (which wasn't even originally terrible, just a couple minor tweaks would've done it) only meant less time they had to work on just about everything else the community asked for. Priorities, Blizzard.  The game isn't dead by any means, no. Starcraft still has the greatest number of interesting personalities and drama, there's still tons of tournaments, and lots of pros still play it. But I can't help but get frustrated as a player, at all the decisions that Blizzard has made over the years - the lack of support, the late patches (that were sometimes pointless, like eg. bunker time 30 -> 35 -> 30 -> 35 or oracle speed changes four times), the lack of care and quality that Blizzard is known for. It frustrates me to no end that Starcraft, the game I love, could've been so much more - that being good at the game and the ridiculous amount of skill and practice it takes actually meant something; that it could've been the number one game on Twitch in terms of viewership; that people would flock to stadium to watch one of the greatest, most competitive, high stakes game ever created - but Blizzard just flat out didn't care. Originally a diehard fan, years of Blizzard's wishy-washiness and lack of commitment to Starcraft II just makes me feel hollow inside.  Yes, I agree with Nazgul's post as in the community should not be so negative all the time. ""ded gaem"" is not contributing positively in anyway. But I do believe that criticism, in general, for Blizzard is needed - in every game, the ones that are the biggest fans should be the biggest criticizers. I believe that over the past few weeks or so, Blizzard has been trying - their latest post was certainly a reassurance that they're at least attempting new things - but if they don't continue to work on the game even after Legacy of the Void comes out, I don't see SC2 lasting for the long run.  TL;DR - I don't feel like Blizzard cares about what Starcraft II is up to, and couldn't care less if it dies. Their stubborness in some of their design philosophies, late patches, constant problems, map hackers rampaging ladder, inconsistancies and not really caring about the community makes it so I just don't want to support a game with all those problems. I mean, even Riot, with much less money, posts lore stories, balance patches every so often (with a complete redesign every season or so), things fans have made, host art contests, and generally attempt to get feedback from all their players - and uses their feedback in future patches.  I acknowledge that I've been wanting to write this for a while, and as such my bottled-up emotions may have led me to state certain things with a slight bias. I believe that my points, generally, are objectively true but of course, my opinion of Blizzard is an opinion. I just want to speak for the players who quit for similar reasons like mine, and perhaps if Blizzard is reading this, do something about it. Because seriously, I really want SC2 to succeed.  note: I still play this game, but casually with friends in 2v2s and 4v4s. I also watch it quite regularly whenever there are some good names."
