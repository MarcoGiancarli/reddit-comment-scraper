Also make sure your chair is an appropriate size, mine is super comfortable but massive and way to big for the booth, makes spinning and getting in and out a bitch"
techtheatre,3e3g67,Proggz,4,Tue Jul 21 18:43:16 2015 UTC,It might be worth it to go for CAT5/6 and some Art-Net/ACN nodes instead of pure DMX for future expansion/compatability.
techtheatre,3e3g67,Gaff_Tape,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:30:45 2015 UTC,Why do you suggest this instead of DMX?
techtheatre,3e3g67,Gaff_Tape,4,Tue Jul 21 20:57:42 2015 UTC,"With DMX, you're limited to one universe for every DMX cable you run (two if you use some non-standard trickery). If you ever run into a situation where you need more universes than DMX cables you have installed (i.e. rented moving lights), you'll need to run extra DMX cables out of the booth and through the house to wherever you need to go, and that can get messy.  With Art-Net and ACN, you can have one CAT5/6 cable run from the booth to wherever you need to go, and that single cable can carry multiple universes (32,768 is the limit for Art-Net III). Most modern consoles and PC applications can output DMX over Art-Net/ACN natively, but to get from that to DMX you'll need nodes to convert the data. Fortunately, they function exactly like a computer network; adding nodes is as easy as plugging them into a standard Gigabit switch or router and addressing them to the correct Art-Net universe.   TL;DR: Fewer cables, more room for expansion.  EDIT: Another idea: get CAT6 runs to various places around the theater (off-stage right/left, FOH, booth, electrics, booth), then have them all terminate at a patch panel. This way you can easily modify the networks for lighting (Art-Net/ACN) and audio (Dante/AES50, etc). Talk to a theatre consultant; they'll know what's best."
techtheatre,3e3g67,Mnemonicly,2,Tue Jul 21 21:26:56 2015 UTC,"I like nodes, but dmx has survived at least two generations of nodes and will probably last a few more.  How many dmx runs can you install for the price of a node?"
techtheatre,3e3g67,Proggz,2,Wed Jul 22 00:52:17 2015 UTC,We do some projections our problem is we aren't the only group in the space so we are trying to get our own projector to make working in the space easier. My biggest problem right now is that we have a massive rats nest of cables. I have a bunch of space from my desk to the back wall so space isn't the real issue. Especially since the whole rack is in the wall. We really need the renovation just based on the time it's been since the last upgrade (early 2000's).
techtheatre,3e3g67,darkjedi521,2,Tue Jul 21 20:57:07 2015 UTC,"Rats nest can be cleaned up by seeing what you really need back there, and then label and cable tie things together.

techtheatre,3e0iln,LeAudiophile,5,Tue Jul 21 00:48:13 2015 UTC,I was always under the impression that the connector is 5 pin so it doesn't get confused for an audio cable that has high voltage flowing through it. Plugging that audio line into a lighting console/fixture will fry it.

techtheatre,3e0iln,philtech,15,Tue Jul 21 00:58:45 2015 UTC,"The only things that pins 4 and 5 have ever been used for are proprietary uses limited to specific manufacturers, and most of these were dumb. Like sending voltage over pin 4 and 5 to power something. Although pins 4 and 5 were originally specified to provide for future expansion, when RDM finally rolled around it was decided not to use pins 4 and 5 for RDM because by that point they had been bastardized by quite a few manufacturers in defiance of the original standard.   Edit to provide link to the actual standards.  http://tsp.plasa.org/tsp/documents/published_docs.php  ANSI E1.20 - 2010 Entertainment Technology-RDM-Remote Device Management over USITT DMX512 Networks  ANSI E1.11 - 2008 (R2013) Entertainment Technology - USITT DMX512-A, Asynchronous Serial Digital Data Transmission Standard for Controlling Lighting Equipment and Accessories  Kudos to Prosight Specialty Insurance.

techtheatre,3e0iln,SummerMummer,10,Tue Jul 21 01:33:06 2015 UTC,"No, RDM is interleaved in the DMX signal on pins 2 & 3. So long as that cable is 110 ohm impedance cable it will work fine for DMX & RDM.  http://www.onstagelighting.co.uk/lighting-equipment/stage-lighting-control/rdm-dmx-guide/"
techtheatre,3e0iln,SummerMummer,4,Tue Jul 21 01:17:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the misinformation.   No problem. What you had been told would make sense. For a long time I thought RDM used pins 4 & 5.  BTW, there is plenty of 110 ohm 2 conductor shielded cable out there. The audio world uses it for digital (AES/EBU) audio signals. Only difference is the number of pins on the connector."
techtheatre,3e0iln,philtech,3,Tue Jul 21 01:43:23 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply :D   The big reason for single twisted pair DMX like you show is cost savings. Copper is spendy. Better to save that money for buying feeder cable...
techtheatre,3e0iln,shiftingtech,2,Tue Jul 21 02:10:53 2015 UTC,I believe that the original standard specifically mentioned running a second universe on pins 4 and 5.  That was taken out of the revised version though.
techtheatre,3e0iln,techieman33,2,Tue Jul 21 01:57:15 2015 UTC,I don't think I've seen anyone other than AVO do that. For a number of years their consoles only had 2 DMX outputs and you would need a Y cable to split them to 4 universes.
techtheatre,3e0iln,shiftingtech,2,Tue Jul 21 02:42:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, no doubt lack of wide spread use was one of the reasons they felt okay about taking it out of the 2004 revision"

techtheatre,3e0iln,frostwhitewolf,2,Tue Jul 21 01:02:42 2015 UTC,"yeah 3-pin XLR is like half the cost of 5-pin. Just mark the cables as being DMX only. It's not only cheaper gear, a lot of manufacturers use 3-pin (or both) on their fixtures"
techtheatre,3e0iln,philtech,3,Tue Jul 21 10:51:15 2015 UTC,"A lot of el cheapo DJ caliber gear has 3 pin DMX. Anything professional will have 5 pin.

techtheatre,3e0iln,frostwhitewolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:23 2015 UTC,So Martin doesn't produce 'professional' fixtures? A lot of their lights either have only 3 pin or both 3 and 5 pin connectors
techtheatre,3e0iln,philtech,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:17:08 2015 UTC,"Legacy Martin stuff was 3 pin. Their current production has both, but the 3 pin is really about accommodating connections with legacy or el cheapo gear. Everything new that I've seen in at least the last 5 or so years, with three pin only, has been less than touring / production grade."
techtheatre,3e0iln,SummerMummer,2,Wed Jul 22 01:42:42 2015 UTC,"Just mark the cables as being DMX only.   You can do this for ownership reasons, but 3-pin DMX cable works just fine for audio too. Actually, it's theoretically slightly better due to the higher impedance."

If you don't start driving after a few seconds it defaults back to the lift. Also, if the platform is lowered they can move pretty quickly. Enough to shoot forward a foot or two and hurt someone.   I know you disagree, but it is absolutely a design flaw. Controls should be predictable and repeatable. A switch should do the same thing every time you flip it, plain and simple  There is no reason they shouldn't use a momentary toggle to raise and lower the platform, the current setup is dangerous. Stay safe."
techtheatre,3dyh7s,kitlane,3,Mon Jul 20 16:32:41 2015 UTC,"""There is no reason they shouldn't use a momentary toggle to raise and lower the platform""  Do you mean a momentary toggle that directly controls raise and lower (rather than a toggle that selects the mode of operation of the joystick)? If so then wouldn't I lose control of the rate of ascent or descent with a toggle switch?"
techtheatre,3dyh7s,FallenGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:50:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, a toggle that directly controls the platform.  You may lose a little control, but most other lifts use momentary toggles and it isn't a problem. Your standard JLG boom lift has joysticks for drive and boom, but every other function is a momentary toggle. Articulation, jib, telescope, platform rotate, ect. In practice isn't hard to control as is and most have a speed setting as well so you can make all the reactions happen as slowly as you need."
techtheatre,3dyh7s,Tippytom,3,Mon Jul 20 18:08:51 2015 UTC,"Any control scheme has it's dangers - defaulting back to the lift could result in you smashing down on something or up into something. I suppose ideally you'd have entirely separate controls, but still you could have operator error.    If you don't start driving after a few seconds it defaults back to the lift  A switch should do the same thing every time you flip it   These are definitely mutually exclusive; the first one could be particularly dangerous. Imagine a situation where you're carefully moving under something, and you pause for a few seconds to make sure you're clear. Move forwards again and suddenly you're going up and hitting exactly what you were trying to avoid. Any time the lift changes operation without your knowledge you could do something dangerous."
techtheatre,3dyh7s,Exelar,0,Mon Jul 20 18:58:48 2015 UTC,"I know, this is why I wish every lift had a separate momentary togggle to raise and lower   Edit: this reply is somewhat confusing. I meant a separate switch to operate the platform that is completely independent from the drive joystick. Also, I believe I misremembered that control. It has a timeout for both drive and lift.

techtheatre,3dyh7s,Pyro_Cat,6,Mon Jul 20 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"Thats operator error.  Think of it like a car with an automatic transmission and the car is in neutral. If the driver accidentally puts it in reverse instead of drive, is that a design flaw or operator error?"
techtheatre,3dyh7s,Mnemonicly,2,Mon Jul 20 16:30:16 2015 UTC,"Operator error yes, still a design flaw.   Automatic transmission always controls movement, and there are multiple indicators of its position. You can feel it with your hand, look over and see its position, and all newer cars have a dashboard indicator.   If your shifter opened the trunk if you has a switch in a different position we wouldn't stand for it. Stay safe."
techtheatre,3dyh7s,ImThatFairlyOddGirl,3,Mon Jul 20 16:37:42 2015 UTC,"No, operator error, pure and simple.  The toggle also has a label on it.  An operator that just slams the joystick is not being cautious, not being alert.  The situation you are describing is called ""An Incident"" and where I'm from in Canada it requires the lift master to send that operator for a refresher course before they are allowed to operate it again."
techtheatre,3dyh7s,midnight_nyc,2,Mon Jul 20 19:59:03 2015 UTC,"Why can't it be both, accidents have multiple contributions.   If you have an intersection with stop sign that isn't very visible, and a car blows through it that is partly driver error. Had they been paying more attention and driving slower maybe they would have spitted the sign. But putting in a better sign could have stopped it too. And what makes us humans is the ability to design our environment to our advantage. And eliminate as many pitfalls as possible, and having poorly designed equipment is a problem we can solve. Because I don't want to see anyone crushed by a lift, and we can train people until the cows come home, there will still be idiots climbing into a scissor. So add the toggle switch too. Attack the problem from all sides.  Really, the only reason I posted is because this shook me up a bit and I want everyone to keep their eyes open when someone is nearby in a lift. That's all, just a heads up that things are far from perfect and stay as safe as you can."
techtheatre,3dyh7s,Vidioot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:20:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Your analogy is not quite right. Imagine a manual transmission car with two stick shifts. You are driving and suddenly have to shift down, you grab the wrong one. Fuck.  It isn't entirely the designs fault, but it increases the likelihood of operator error, which is a flaw. Humans can only be so perfect, but building a machine that doesn't encourage simple mistakes like that goes a long way. That is why the self destruct button is usually under one of those protective flip up covers."
techtheatre,3dyh7s,Pyro_Cat,4,Tue Jul 21 03:35:37 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of the ""If you idiot proof something, all you do is make better idiots"" adage.  People who aren't paying attention to what they are about to do in their 3000 pound lift are probably not paying attention to many other things going on and that they are doing. I think a bigger issue with scissor lifts is that no two manufcaturers can agree on whether pushing the joystick forward means the lift should go up or the lift should go down.  I see far more issues with that as people swap between lifts than I do with people randomly driving forward blindly.    That being said, you should always give scissor lifts (and other lifts) a decent safety distance around them.  Expect people to be stupid and you'll rarely be disappointed."

Four in the corners  and two on the middle edges.   Would give be sufficient (four corners, one dead center)?  They are all free rotating.   Have I mentioned I hate wagons?"
techtheatre,3dw903,familyguy829,5,Mon Jul 20 01:35:36 2015 UTC,"Personally, I only use 4 castors with 2x4 framing and 3/4"" ply. I never have any flexing and 4 castors means there won't be any teetering if the wagon rolls over an un-level portion of the stage. Just my 2 cents."
techtheatre,3dw903,squints_at_stars,7,Mon Jul 20 01:54:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do four - that's a long unsupported span, and depending on what's ON the platform, it could be a lot of weight for only 4 wheels.   Our house standard is 6; our TDs are usually cheap and don't buy high-rating casters."
techtheatre,3dw903,familyguy829,3,Mon Jul 20 02:49:00 2015 UTC,"I used to be the TD and Master Carp. at a children's theatre, so I suppose I'm used to building primarily for light weight loads where an 8' span is solid - however, I still think 6 is a little overkill for most builds. At least from my experience, working in older theatres the stage is not very forgiving. Installing 6 castors ends up being a headache because you've got a wagon with 3 linear points of contact. Any ""unlevelness"" on the stage causes a see-saw effect. Again - just my 2 cents, speaking from experience."
techtheatre,3dw903,kent_eh,6,Mon Jul 20 03:08:28 2015 UTC,"If your floor is that uneven, then put a layer of 1/8 under the outside corner casters, and install the 2 mid-span casters directly to the deck. That should talke care of preventing hi-centering (unless your floor is really bad), and if the load is enough to cause flexing, then the middle casters start talking load after 1/8 of flex."
techtheatre,3dw903,familyguy829,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:55:47 2015 UTC,I agree with your method. That does remedy the situation.
techtheatre,3dw903,PoopScootnBoogey,5,Mon Jul 20 15:02:22 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree with you on this one.  I ALWAYS use 6 casters for a 4x8 platform made out of 3/4"" ply.  It's standard practice in the industry.  You want these things to roll freely and easily.    If you only have 4 casters, then you can't put a large amount of weight on it and expect it to not bow in the middle or even drag."
techtheatre,3dw903,Griffie,2,Mon Jul 20 04:44:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. Any 4' x 8' platform should have six points of support, be it castors or legs. I've had bad experiences with platforms breaking in half when they are only supported by the corners (they had several people on them when they failed)."
techtheatre,3dw903,familyguy829,2,Mon Jul 20 05:29:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, 4 is standard practice. I've never had a platform with only 4 castors bow on me. 6 is excessive. This also includes legs. I've raised multiple platforms 6'+ high with 4 legs with multiple people on top and no problems occurred. Like I said, that's from my experience with many professional theatre companies. If you've had 4x8s bend on you then I can't speak for your experience. What exactly are you using for your frame? Also, If you're having trouble with wagon movement you may want to try wagon brakes. It's standard practice in the industry."
techtheatre,3dw903,PoopScootnBoogey,-6,Mon Jul 20 06:03:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, it's official. You don't know what you're doing and you need to revise your practices before someone gets hurt.   Your kind of philosophy is the reason why stage pit covers collapse.    Edit: iPhone boned me on grammar."

There's absolutely nothing wrong with only 4 points of contact. As long as your framing is sturdy and ridged you will not encounter any safety issues. I know what I'm talking about and so do the dozens of other carpenters I've worked with over the years. I suggest you revisit your backstage handbook.

techtheatre,3dw903,techieman33,3,Mon Jul 20 23:37:55 2015 UTC,You're going to see more flex with ply than you would with 2x.  Depends on the load and how much it moves.  Also I'd say that on an unlevel floor you'd rather have six casters... if your floor is unlevel enough for these casters to matter it's better for it to see-saw than bottom out.
techtheatre,3dw903,familyguy829,2,Mon Jul 20 01:59:03 2015 UTC,"Probably will be fine. Just give it a shot, throw 4 on in the corners and put some weight on it to see if it flexes to much."
techtheatre,3dw903,stageop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:43:24 2015 UTC,If the ply strips work for you - go for it. I highly suggest refraining from 6 castors though. Depends on the quality of the stage I suppose but you're still looking at 2 superfluous castors.
techtheatre,3dw903,familyguy829,-5,Mon Jul 20 02:18:12 2015 UTC,What deflection calculation are you using  ? Because no math I can do backs up your claim.  If the stage is a problem level the stage or have self leveling caster or get v-groved casters and them travel on a track.
techtheatre,3dw903,paranoidgoat,2,Mon Jul 20 02:18:47 2015 UTC,"Not all stages are setup for a track system.  It's a matter of simple physics. There's no need for calculations to figure it out. I've seen it happen.  If you have 3 sets of castors and there's a low point in the stage the first set of castors to roll into this low point will likely be raised above the stage because the middle castors are still in the level stage with the last set. Not by much but enough to cause the wagon to wobble.  It's currently 2am here so everything I just wrote may not make much sense. If I'm remember tomorrow I'll try to elaborate further.  Edit: Also, you don't always have time to fix a stage."

techtheatre,3dv182,ArgonWolf,18,Sun Jul 19 19:16:44 2015 UTC,"Are touring musical act stories allowed here? Hopefully it's not out of place.  I tour with a country artist, and we were at an outdoor show in Auburn, Alabama, at a rodeo / concert / hoedown...thing.  First off, I hate outdoor shows with passion, they're hard on gear, they're either too hot or too cold or rainy. Dust gets on the lights, heat shuts down amplifiers, dock areas are never big enough. This particular show had no barricaded path to FOH, you just had to throw elbows to get through the crowd of incredibly rowdy drunk redneck college students. Fine, whatever. So during the day, I ask the local production contact who brought the followspots to please make sure that they are tested and in working order, and I am assured that they will be. Thinking that hooking up two followspots is pretty easy, I don't think too much about it until about two hours before we're on, when I make my way out to FOH to check on things and talk to the spot ops, who report that they can't get their spots to lamp on. Thinking that's odd, I look up the scaff tower behind me to see two big plugs dangling in mid-air. No electricity ran to them, and we're counting down to show. I call the production contact, and nothing - she won't answer. Text, call multiple times, leave several voicemails, nothing. I then call her production company and ask what the hell is going on. They can't get a hold of her either.  At this point, I assume she's not coming back ever, and I start to figure out how we're gonna get two twenty-amp circuits out to FOH. Running lines won't be possible, I don't carry 600 extra feet of cable, and getting it through the crowd which has formed will be a formidable challenge. None of the local guys have that much cable either, so I talk to the local production manager, and ask what my options are. By this time, my production manager is breathing down my neck, asking if we're going to be ready for show. The solution we eventually hit upon is that a generator will have to be towed out to FOH via a pickup truck through the crowd, which shows up at FOH about 30 minutes before show right as the local production person shows up, doesn't even apologize, just sort of shrugs at the spots not having power.  Show starts, lubed up crowd decides to pelt my spot ops with beer cans - not all empty ones either - many are full, unopened ones - forcing me to be the bad guy and asking them to stay in the spot towers, while beer cans rain down on us. At one point I get hit in the leg with one, several VIP guests at FOH get showered with an open can, and another open one rains its contents all over the sound guy's SD8. To top it off, artist calls out from stage that he can't see the whole crowd (of 25,000 with four six blinders, no kidding?) while the PM screams in my ear for more lights.  tl;dr: suck it Auburn students"

With the house full of audience members and us 45 minutes after we were supposed to start I say their show has to run. Their timing is way off and their cues are all over the place. Their show was meant to be two and a half hours with an intermission and it looked like they'd go over time.   We skip the intermission as its nearing 11pm. Their insurance runs out at midnight and it'll take at least 30 min to strike. I tell them we may have to cut short if we get to 1130 as legally they had to be off premises by midnight. They say they're 10 min from ending. At 11:15 they're 5 min from ending.   At 11:25 they're 5 min from ending and I say ""look, if you're not done by 11:30 I have to bring up the house lights and end the show. You and the audience have to be out by midnight. You have the chance now to address your audience and tell them what's going on and what the plan for the future is.""   They say ""we're almost done. 5 minutes, please.""

No dock on this venue, so we are stuck running the truck lift gates all night.  On this particular truck, the lift gate had to fully extend before rocking the 10-ish degrees to level to be loaded on the street.  Fine, whatever, but said truck was parked such that this caused the lift gate to bear an non-insignificant portion of the truck's weight while fully extended (We pointed this out, but they said something along the lines of ""meh"").  From here, you can guess what happened.  The last time that it was lowered to take on more gear (I think it was truss at that point), the lift refused to go back up.  At all.  So here we are, almost fully loaded truck, unable to move because the lift gate is grounded, blocking the out path for this ""dock"".  Oh, did I mention that it was 20 degrees below zero F (-28.9 Celsius)?  Cue all sorts of shenanigans to unstick the truck (sticking par cans under the truck to unfreeze the hydralic lines, hammers, ford wrench, hammers, etc).  No good.

techtheatre,3dv182,ThatLightingGuy,2,Mon Jul 20 04:46:30 2015 UTC,"We do a lot of festivals, so take your pick. The biggest cascading issue was at a country festival.  First, the stage. They brought in this four-post lift style stage that was supposed to have 2-ton motors but instead had truck winches. My entire load limit for the lighting rig was 1000lbs. So, one span of truss and all the par cans I can fit in that weight limit because they're the lightest things I have. Can't load the deck because they built it with 1/2"" ply and no support so when somebody accidentally dropped a monitor from 3 feet, it went right through the deck.  Last day, it's about 35 dec C out. We have a big 200A distro handling the audio system from a generator. Well, in an effort to keep that distro cool, we put a couple fans on it and parked a trailer in front of it to keep the sun off. Production manager tows the trailer...and the main breaker overheats and trips about 20 minutes later during the headliner set. Stage goes quiet, lights are still up...but my console was powered off the FoH circuit on the 200A distro.  Console at the time was an old Maxxyz, and the outage was the last straw. Blew up one whole side of the unit. Wouldn't reboot (still won't, to this day, even with repairs). I rip the DMX cable out the back so that the dimmers hold their last value and we don't go dark. Audio is back up at this point thanks to a hasty trailer re-park and a swamp cooler.  Now, I knew this console was flakey and brought a big old Leprecon to save my ass. I turn around to where I had it stored in the FoH tent and...nothing. It's gone. Get on the radio, nothing. Nobody has a clue where this thing is.

Community theatre type production, years ago, in a space with a weird fly system: the architect apparently cut off the top of the fly tower, so that everything had to be yoyoed - overload the arbor, bring in the pipe, overload that, lather, rinse, repeat.  We had a Crucifixion Wagon that our Jesus would lie on, it would be wheeled into place under fog, a pair of hands would bring in the pipe with lines into place, one tech on each side would attach it to the cross. Once the all attached was given, the fly-ops would overhaul the pipe out.  This particular night, one of the ops couldn't get out of work, so we were a hand down. No worries, one of the other hands wasn't busy at that time, so he said he'd cover. Unbeknownst to the rest of the crew, the remaining fly-op told this kid that he was the one doing most of the pulling anyways, so his presence wouldn't be vital. Same op had also strained his shoulder the night before.  The scene comes, we get JC in place, the lines come in. My counterpart on the right side of the cross gets clipped in quickly and reports ""right clipped"" over headset. I'm almost clipped in when the lines start going out. Try to report ""not yet!"", but the line rips out of my hand as JC gets flipped sideways, tweaking his back out, since he's holding his arm ropes firmly, and he's belted in.  Ended up with no Crucifixion that night (but the lx guy did a good job of making the suggestion), and we had a stunt Jesus for the rest of the run. And a massage therapist working on JC during his offstage time for the rest of the run, too."

There were about 4000 people per night.  Audio forgot to turn off a microphone after a change. The actor wearing it went to the bathroom. The sound of his piss was amplified through the open field in which the audience sat and over the hills behind, echoing into the distance down the valley where the town lie.  And then he flushed.  It was one of those really quiet poignant parts where Tevye soliloquises, too. Just the gentle whine of klezmer music, an equity actor who only played Tevye slogging tiredly through his lines for the thousandth time and getting annoyed, and the loud splashing of some poor fucker pissing backstage."
techtheatre,3dsbww,PaddyO666,9,Sun Jul 19 03:45:26 2015 UTC,"Little Shop of Horrors  My high school was doing Little Shop of Horrors and it was during intermission.  The opening of the second act starts with Seymour and Audrey answering phone calls in the shop.  We had the scene all set, but someone operating the sound board accidentally hit the cue for the phones to start ringing and then... left?  I'm not entirely sure what happened up there, but Audrey and Seymour come running onstage and start pretending to answer phones for the rest of intermission (about 5-8 minutes).  Proof  This past fall my college was doing Proof and at the top of the show the props crew forgot to set a bottle of champagne on the bench onstage (and, to be fair, as the SM I forgot to check).  The entire opening scene and scene following it revolves around this bottle of champagne.  We're already nearly halfway through the scene before the actors notice it's missing - the point where the father is like, ""Surprise!  Champagne for your birthday!""  I can't remember how the actors fixed that one, but from then on I had a giant sticky note in my prompt book saying, ""CHECK FOR CHAMPAGNE"".  Oliver  I'm ASMing for a community production of Oliver.  We don't have headsets in this theater, so if anything goes wrong onstage we don't know until the actors come offstage or someone else sees and tells us.  In the scene with the funeral director, Oliver gets pushed into a coffin and then someone sits on it.  When he was pushed in, his mic pack somehow flew off of his body and landed on the outside of the coffin while he landed on the inside.  The actor then pops out of the coffin and grabs the mic pack and pops back in.  When he got offstage we thought it'd be a quick screw-the-mic-cord-back-in deal, but actually the cord was severed and I had like 45 seconds to run up to the second floor of the booth and grab a new mic cord and mic tape and run back down and string the thing through his shirt and tape it to his face before pushing him back onstage.  In that same show one actor was missing his bag of stolen goods which played some significant role in the final scene.  He runs to me and says he can't find it.  So I found a burlap tablecloth nearby and a bunch of metal glasses from an act one song so I grabbed it all and tied it together and gave it to him as he ran onstage.  The Wedding Singer  We had a rotating platform that we used in almost every scene change.  In the middle of the opening number we would rotate the band on.  An actor was dancing near the rotating platform when it began rotating.  He set his foot back just perfectly enough to catch the rotator and stumble back as the rotator closed, successfully rotating him offstage.  It kinda worked because he was the drunk brother?  Same rotator, same show: I played Glen Guglia and I was rotated on in my DeLorean for one scene.  More than once the run crew rotated me on backwards so it looked like I was reversing my car onstage."

techtheatre,3dsbww,johnnydirnt,4,Sun Jul 19 03:48:49 2015 UTC,"Oh man. So many.   Sound of Music  We had 4x8 walls that rotated to change the scene so Mother Superior's office was like black with a window or something. We set the walls backstage to just roll them on in order and more than one time, one ended up rotated wrong and she had a black wall and a blue wall. I never understood how that happened. Like you've got them set correctly in the wings. Just roll them on just like that.   Hairspray  We had paryactoids, however you spell it. They were automated, run by a button that the stage manager operated. They were also loud. We constructed shrouds to put over the motor and then stapled black fabric to the outside for even more sound hiding. The shroud got kicked slightly and the fabric got caught in the wheel preventing us from turning the walls. It was stuck at half Baltimore and half Corny Collins for the rest of the act. Those walls were terrible.   Mary Poppins  It was one the first night of flying Mary into the balcony. We were working on it after a tech rehearsal so we didn't have an audience. Just the random people who come up to watch, family of the cast. The fly crew is ready. Mary is ready. She's hooked up and we go. She gets stuck halfway to the balcony. They can't move her at all. Somehow the rope came off the track. The producer is freaking out. They thought they were going to have to basket catch her for a few minutes then somehow the crew managed to track her backwards to the stage. They still couldn't lower her. The producer went and got the lift to get her down (at that point she was only about five feet from the ground) and then the crew snapped the rope back and got her down. Turns out one of the crew hadn't gotten the memo that you couldn't stand to the side of the rope and pull. You had to be directly behind it."

We had a sketchy sound system so we were manually turning mics off when actors had a significant downtime. I guess we missed one, and the sound guy wasn't muting them. Actors had been pretty quiet in general, so the guy with the live mic must have been offstage for a bit and was confident it was off, because he started talking to one of the other actors about how he was fucking an actress currently onstage. Yeah, the talking guy's girlfriend was in the audience. Honestly, the only person I really felt bad for was the sound guy, who was convinced he'd personally ruined a relationship in front of 50 people."
techtheatre,3dsbww,TheFoolishWit,2,Sun Jul 19 18:08:03 2015 UTC,"Just remembered one that didn't manifest immediately but was caused in part by a scene change. Doing the Mikado several years back and a peice of scenery or prop had been placed against a wall between scenes. The peice settled while the next scene was going on and pressed up against a switch that lowered an automated projection screen. As the three little maids were singing their song, the screen slowly lowered until it reached it's end; right in front of the faces of the singers. I was the only one who knew the stage well enough to understand what happened and where the button was to raise the screen up so I bolted through the backstage pass through to the other wing and pressed the button to send the screen up. And up it went... Slowly."

Two of our set pieces were doors on casters, and there was a small ramp that had to be placed in front of one of the doors to accommodate a wheelchair. During a dress rehearsal, I moved one of the doors out during a blackout, put its brakes down, and started to head offstage. Little did I know that another stagehand had moved the other door out and placed the ramp in front of it... causing me to trip over the ramp in the pitch black and faceplant on stage. Luckily I got up and offstage before the lights came back up, but I sat backstage nursing my sore ankles and wrists for a bit afterwards.  Another mishap from that show: we had a doorknob fall off in an actor's hand one night. Thankfully the audience got a kick out of it, and the actor brilliantly ad-libbed into the next scene. Not so much a scene change mishap as it is an example of the half-assed construction that went on that year."

This would give you a starting point for talking to design-build contractors. Potentially also hiring the consultants for a 3rd party review of shop drawings would also be helpful.   Small projects like this can run overboard on budget very quickly so consultants avoid them, but if you can limit their scope to bare bones sketches and not require formal construction drawings and spec sections, most theatre consultants will try to help if they have the time available."

techtheatre,3de38d,LockeClone,2,Wed Jul 15 21:28:20 2015 UTC,"Several things wrong with that still. Those half-hitches really need to be tighter against the steel. When you're doing an install, It's actually common to use a hammer to squeeze those knots before the system stretches out and you loose a bunch of play.  Then, The other lineset is not moused down, and when you use half-hitches like that, mousing is NOT OPTIONAL. Really good gaff tape might have been OK, but good E-tape is less susceptable to dust and rotting away like that gaff in the picture clearly has.   I highly sugest that OP pull an audible and mouse down those dead ends when nobody is looking. Use E-tape and make it look nice. Nobody will say anything and it will be safe...er.  That silica rope also looks to be in meh condition. It looks like new lines have been added or replaced with synthetic line. For how long that's been standard issue and given that hemp line has a shelf-life, no house in America SHOULD be using hemp line. In ten years, the remaining hemp lines will be downright dangerous."
techtheatre,3de38d,faderjockey,2,Wed Jul 15 19:45:54 2015 UTC,"Ha, that's what I'm dealing with in my house right now:  a full system of hemp operating lines that are mumblety-decades old, in one of the most humid states in the USA.  Multiple rigging inspection reports in hand, the powers-that-be are still looking the other way.  Probably because replacing them with proper synthetics would require purchasing a whole new set of rope locks, plus modifications to our custom locking rail, etc."

techtheatre,3de38d,pintocow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:05:30 2015 UTC,"Mousing is basically using some sort of unrated stuff to keep a piece of rated hardware from moving over time. Examples include bailing wire to keep a turnbuckle from moving and a zip tie to keep a shackle pin in place permanently.   In this case, half hitches tend to work themselves lose over time, unlike a figure 8 retrace or an alpine butterfly. Because of this, for any permanent install the tail needs to be moused down with something, which makes it so that the knot wont do this.   E-tape is often used. On hemp rope, some kind of smaller string is good. I've also seen specialized shrink wrap and bailing wire, though I don't recommend those two unless mandated by the manufacturer, because you can't be sure that heat or steel wouldn't mess with the rope's structure."

Some also had the trailing end tied off with like just random bits of of hemp that had come unraveled. Turned into spending more than a day fixing these things.

Since the people are all volunteer, their proficiency and aptitude usually falls into the category of ""who showed up today and how much do they know?""  My very first community theatre show as an actor, I got volunteered by the director to light the show (something I'd never done before), and since their previous tech guru just left the theatre due to a messy divorce between him and a board member, I had to learn how to hang, patch, and program by reading manuals and experimenting.

Most systems I've used have ended up having a gap of around 3cm between cradles; enough to ensure they can't crash into each other as they move.  This obviously affects the width of the cradle and weights within it.  In the few retrofitted systems I've used (added to non-counterweight theatres) the cradles have run on tensioned steel wire guides which require even more space between to avoid potential crashes.  More on the order of 20cm.  In these systems though, the cradles weren't in a traditional location. So the position of the counterweighted bars was determined by the requirements of each production, and suitable diverter pulleys were installed in the grid to suit."

Reducing the length would reduce the number of clips you could use and will reduce the efficiency rating.  Increasing the turnback and spacing enough (we don’t know what that upper limit is) would begin to decrease the effectiveness of the clips working together. We recommend to follow the applications instructions listed in our catalog.   Neat tip:   Also, the width of the clip base turns out to be around half of the clip spacing distance, therefore making it possible to use a clip as a measuring tool to space the clips.   cc /u/johnnydirnt"

techtheatre,3ddoll,johnnydirnt,2,Sat Jul 18 15:10:23 2015 UTC,I thought it was in case of slippage. That's also why you use two clips on a line. It's a safety redundancy and adds more friction into the mechanism.
techtheatre,3ddoll,johnnydirnt,2,Wed Jul 15 13:53:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe.    The wire rope is out of deformation within say 2-3 rope diameters, so it would then not matter if the clips were say 1"" apart vs. about 4"".  The language around turnback is very specific (4-3/4"", not 5""), which it wouldn't need to be if it were just that.  I'm happy to be wrong =)"

Very few theatres will care about where you went to school as long as you know your stuff.

I went to OU for a year of grad school and ended up leaving for personal reasons. The teachers were great with good professional histories when I went there, but I get the feeling that most, if not all main stage designs went to grad students. My personal undergrad was University of Northern Colorado, which wasn't any of my top choices but was in state and cheap. It turned out giving me a great education and gave me a strong resume. It also hosted a professional summerstock that allowed me to get professional credits. Granted I have been gone almost 10 years, not sure how the program is now.  Also, really really try to not take out a fuck-ton of student loans. It might not seem like a big deal to you now, but when you 10 years out and hardly making a dent in your debt, it sucks.  Another thing is you may very well change you mind about what emphasis you want to do. I went into college strongly believing I wanted to be a designer and then discovered I enjoyed the building and crafting process much more. Where ever you go, make sure you have to take some classes in all areas to really figure out what you want to do."

techtheatre,3dby2p,deenakidd,2,Wed Jul 15 05:30:11 2015 UTC,Now I am biased because I'm a current but I love the theater dept at Salisbury uni in Md. What I love about the department is three things but these are things you should look for at any school. 1. The faculty many of the professors there have recent or massive amounts of experience example the SD worked on newsies as the ASD. So in general make sure the faculty are qualified for what they are doing and have connections for post grad work. 2. We are not only a crew we are a family the dept is rather small I'd say 30 majors and a bunch of minors so we each get the direct help we need. I was able to do a independent study geared towards electrics because that is my interest and I have an upcoming internship in a few weeks so I needed the training. 3.the ability to explore other interest. As part of our major you have to get at least a minor which I love because some of us use it to our advantage to better us as technicians for example a fellow girl is getting a double in theater and physics because she loves sound. So I truly get to expand my interest because of the minor and the gen Ed class requirements. So check us out but no matter what school you choose make sure not only the theater but almost everything else fits your needs. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask even if it's about school in general or Salisbury in particular.
techtheatre,3dby2p,captjaneway,2,Wed Jul 15 04:20:23 2015 UTC,"I was just in your situation a year ago. I ended up going to Oklahoma City University. It's a small private college (student pop. is around 3500 IIRC) with what I'd say is a pretty well developed technical department and it's still growing, and on top of that, no grad program. It's an extremely busy program, the design and production had hands in 8 or 9 shows by midterms wether they were theatre, opera/musicals, or dance shows. You really hit the ground running. All of the professors are down to earth and will take time to talk to you if you need it. It's a really tight knit family dynamic that has been created since there's never really any more than 30 tech majors at a time.   I'm majoring in lighting design and production myself and Spring semester of my freshman year, I got to design a couple of things; albeit they were children's theater shows in a space the university has just for that.

Most of the teaching staff are currently working professionals on Broadway, regional theater and some TV/Film. Which provides great practical lessons and connections. The best part however is the alumni network, the people you attend with combined with previous graduates you meet provide connections to getting jobs in everything from Broadway, regional theater, corporate events, TV and film. You will end up spending around 30 hours a week in production working on shows, around 20 hours a week in class and the rest working on various projects for class. You won't have a lot of time during the school year to work on outside projects, but almost everyone goes off to different summer stocks and other seasonal theatre opportunities.

I love my school because of the people there and the teachers that are real world professionals. Go visit schools, go to college fairs, meet the people that teach there, thats how you know if the school is right for you.  Also, if you are into lighting, then look at Webster. The fact that you can get a degree in Concert Lighting is kinda bad ass. We also don't have any grad programs and our professors actually look out for us and care. Also the Dean of the college is our Lighting teacher."
techtheatre,3dby2p,jraat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:17:25 2015 UTC,"My biggest recommendation is go where you can afford to go and don't take on too much debt for an undergrad degree. From my experience the people who excel in this business do so no matter where they went to school. That being said, if you want to be a designer it helps to go somewhere you will get a chance to design. The three things you need when you graduate is the practical experience and skills to do the work, a portfolio of designs showing  those skills and experience, and the actual degree (very useful if you later decide you don't want to do theater at least you have a bachelors in something to build off of). I went to a school with a small theater department, University of South Florida, and what was great about it is was that students got a chance to design large mainstage shows, worked closely with the tenured professors all 4 years (no grad students teaching lower level classes), and if you were ambitious you could really do a lot. As a mentioned earlier, looking at my classmates now (almost 20 years later) the one's who were ambitious and pushed to do shows and were always trying to do more are the ones who have becoming successful. Some went on to grad school and are now professors around the country and one guy left and started working right away and now runs a very successful lighting design company and just did the design for the observation center at the new World Trade Center. I was talking last week with an associate designer who regularly works on Broadway and her undergrad didn't even do real productions but had a robust student theater program that gave her a lot of flexibility and opportunities to work and experiment.  That being said, no matter where you go try to get out and work professionally as much as you can. Whether it's summerstock, working at the local concert hall, club, assisting a local designer, working in a lighting shop over the summer,  whatever... practical professional experience is invaluable and can help give you a broad range of how skills and the opportunity to see how different people do the same thing (colleges tend to have one way of doing things and it's good to learn a variety of ways). The other key part of this is that at your age you can afford to work for the experience more than the pay. If you want to learn something, find someone who is doing it and intern/work for cheap/magically get them to pay a decent rate to learn it. Getting experience on a lot of different lighting consoles, working with different lights, and with/for different people not only increases your employability, but also makes you a better designer. In short work your ass off now and it will pay major dividends later"
techtheatre,3dby2p,jhaggerty97,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:35:14 2015 UTC,"Wow lots of great comments so far. I agree forget about the prestige, find a school where you can get lots of experience. Find a place where your teachers are working professionals. If you know you want to work in a certain area of the country find a school where the professor works in that area. Its not only what you learn but what network connections you can make through your professors. If you want to work in Chicago then DePaul is a great choice as others have suggested. I know CCM, SUNY-Purchase and Webster are all great schools as others have suggested. If you are looking at the west coast I would look at UC Santa Barbara.  Find a school that has a good balance of electrics and design. Some schools try to focus on all design and the fact is your first jobs will require to have a good knowledge of electrics. Out of undergrad there is a good chance you will be your own ME so know your equipment well. For full disclosure I teach lighting at a small college in western New York. I work a lot with the USITT Lighting commission have a lot of friends that teach so if you need help feel free to send me a PM."
techtheatre,3dby2p,manofsea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:26:48 2015 UTC,"Don't know where you live but I would highly recommend going somewhere in state. The cost of education these days is insane and you're not exactly going to school to be a doctor or lawyer, so unless you feel like ponying up $200k+ in student loans for the rest of forever, go somewhere cheap. College is good for you, but also try to work outside of the school. Get in touch with the IATSE local, or the local regional theatre. College is what you make of it. If you are passionate and have a desire to learn, and it sounds like you are, then you'll be fine. Theatre is also entirely about networking, so the allure of going to a place like CCM or Yale or UNCSA is the alumni network you are a part of. Is it worth $200k? I don't think so.  source: went to state school, has no student loans. has job."

I applied to a few conservatories and a few liberal arts and ended up at a liberal arts as a Sound Designer. If you want to be a designer, liberal arts is where you want to be. You finishing your education and becoming a well rounded individual who knows english, philosophy, and history will make you a much better designer down the road. Use your summers and grad school to learn the gear. Plus, at a smaller liberal arts school you'll have more opportunities to design compared to a rigid conservatory program. I know they seem tempting (I almost went to one), but as a designer the liberal arts will give you a better foundation."

Follow up question, do you think you have any kind of responsibility to the the culture of theatre as a whole?"
techtheatre,3d666e,nerfmonks,9,Mon Jul 13 21:53:57 2015 UTC,"That's a common complaint that I hear, that I'm perpetuating the ""Us vs. Them"" dichotomy. The majority of my comics are based on actual things that have happened, or common issues that crop up in these jobs, things I've seen, stories others have told me, etc. When I'm writing, I don't think about ""Us vs. Them."" I put my characters in the booth or shop and see what they say to each other.   As a cartoonist, my job is in part the satire of my subject. Sometimes I poke fun at actors, some times I poke fun a directors, other times it's the audience, or other technicians, but most of the time it is the ridiculous nature of our jobs that get poked.   My comic is for technicians because I am one."
techtheatre,3d666e,passing_phase,5,Mon Jul 13 22:38:52 2015 UTC,"I'd like to follow up on this question as well. I feel like you are in a unique position where your work is really influencing the younger generation of theatre artists. Do you ever consider that in your comic work? As a professional, I can recognize when you are poking fun. Do you ever worry about someone in school seeing one of those ""poke fun"" things and think that's the way it's done in the professional world?  I realize that you can't be everything for everyone, no one can. Just an interesting thing to think about because I think you might be the first of your kind in this business!"
techtheatre,3d666e,passing_phase,10,Mon Jul 13 22:53:58 2015 UTC,"I sometimes have educators email me and tell me that they're using my comics in class and I cringe. I always make sure they know that the comic is absolutely not a primer on stage management, etc. Most of the time my characters are not especially good at their jobs, and that's part of what makes it fun, I think.  It's a comic, not a text book. I think it'd be super boring to write a comic about a perfect, text book production.   I hope that the young people reading my comic my be able to commiserate with some strips and rejoice with others, and see that the little struggles they have are struggles that a lot of us, even professionals, share. I feel I should just state outright though that the comic isn't just for professionals. It's for the high schoolers, college students, hobbyists, too. It has to be. And some of the comics are going to appeal more to one age group than another, and that's fine. The comic is reaching a broader swath of readers than I ever thought possible and that's incredible. I'm just trying to make the best comics I can."

techtheatre,3d666e,passing_phase,-13,Tue Jul 14 00:46:22 2015 UTC,"Well, it's definitely not for professionals.  Whenever I have an assistant show me one of these comics, I shut. it. down. immediately.  It perpetuates stereotypes.  And I don't need assistants who are any snarkier.  The generation of designers coming up just behind me are snarky enough as it is... this perpetuates that Us vs Them mentality mentioned that I can't stand, that we do not need more of."
techtheatre,3d666e,_Volucris_,11,Mon Jul 13 23:48:13 2015 UTC,"Can't things just be fun? Instead of shutting down something that is a fun and light-hearted approach to what we do, enjoy the fact that a humorous outlet like this exists?   I don't disagree that young designers are very snarky, but I hardly think that things like Steve's comics are what are perpetuating this problem. Maybe rather than shutting them down, you could make sure they know that the comics are satire?"
techtheatre,3d666e,VioletVeruca,2,Tue Jul 14 00:43:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe I just haven't had enough experience yet, I'm just a highschool student pushing 4 years in theatre tech now and work at two different locations, what exactly is this ""us v. them"" mentality y'all are talking about?  I sure as hell haven't seen it, might just because I don't exactly know what it is.  EDIT: Spelling."
techtheatre,3d666e,mikewoodld,3,Tue Jul 14 04:18:48 2015 UTC,"I've seen too many young designers and assistants shoot themselves in the foot early in their careers... they make the design too precious, things get cut, ""the director is a jerk grr grr!""   But in fact (and bear with me here), the director is the ""keeper"" of the story.  A good director will have a clear vision and edit things in order to best tell the story.  Some times that is your light cue or soundscape or giant glittery costume that suddenly isn't working in the moment.  A good design team will aid and abet them in order to help the director tell the best looking/sounding story possible.  We all are a team, and the story is what is at the heart of the process.  Too many young designers I know are into things like this...  https://q2qcomics.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/q2q-19.png  The director in this comic is often the buffoon. But this particular comic makes me cringe a little harder... why talk about the nuts and bolts of things?  Why throw out terms like ""gain"" and ""attenuation"" in a conversation with a director?  It's setting up a language divide between the two of you, which could easily translate as a divide for other things on the show. This is a situation I see far too often. Why doesn't the SD just turn the preshow level up? I was told in grad school to ask yourself often ""is this the hill I want to die on?"" Preshow levels, eh, not the hill I want to die on.  So, that's what I mean by the ""us vs them"" mentality.  I think it's incredibly deadly to theatre."
techtheatre,3d666e,_Volucris_,5,Tue Jul 14 05:37:40 2015 UTC,"I'll get in on this too - I totally see what you're saying about that particular comic strip. I guess the way I read it is more of an inner monologue and joke rather than an actual conversation with a director. To me, it is obvious that I would never talk to a director this way. It's a funny inner monologue if a director starts to talk specifics (though in this comic, the sound guy did start this by being technical first.) I've had directors who have told me things like ""bring up that light another 5 points"" and in my head I know that they just want it a little brighter. I'm not going to argue with them over exact percentages. It's my job to figure out how much brighter it needs to be and not be an asshole who tries to show off to them. Sometimes their ""add 5 points"" actually can be accomplished by changing a color, or bringing something else down, etc etc. Sorry, I'm rambling.   Just like this one: https://q2qcomics.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/q2q-121.png. Would I be that much of an asshole and go to a director with a sticky note of these things? Of course not. But is it funny to see? Absolutely.   I totally see your point about how for a young person starting out, this could be read as an example of being snarky and showing off ""how much you know."" I totally see that. I guess, like /u/passing_phase, I think that the humor in Steve's strips is great and it's our responsibility as professionals to educate young people about professionalism. That's my whole point here, I guess. That yeah, it can be dangerous for a young person to get validation on their snarkiness, but professionals can recognize the satire and see it as such."
techtheatre,3d666e,VioletVeruca,3,Tue Jul 14 14:41:35 2015 UTC,"OK, I do believe I understand now.  Here is my two cents though. Although as I keep moving around I may encounter this. But based on my experience at my highschool theatre (technically a community theatre,) and the regional theatre I recently started to work at...I just don't see it. I guess it just doesn't hit some people hard enough, but even sitting here as an 18 year old just starting to walk into the professional world, I've always promoted and even romanticized the concept of ""family theatre."" Because at the end of the day, especially in venues where there is a consistent crew, that's what are, a family.   This is all being said, I think it's good for directors to be flexible enough to give designers a shot at their idea, but when their idea is clearly not working (not necessarily meaning it's a bad idea,) then they need to just accept that and move on. Even professionals have bad ideas all the time, luckily most of them are easy fixes. There is after all a reason they call it a ""director."" So that I agree on.  As for the comics themselves, I take them light heartily and find them kind of entertaining. Because although it's satire, I can imagine many of those conversations to some realistic degree actually happening. That being said, I see your point in turn on how they can be detrimental, especially to those in the education fields. I've learned pretty quickly from a lot of people based on stories they tell...there's a lot of young, new, fresh individuals out there - usually with degrees that think they're king of the hill and that their concepts and designs are infallible...and in turn I can kind of see why these comics might support that viewpoint.  But I think we kind of have to come to the point where as techs we need to just admit there are going to be so many conceited assholes in the industry. So many people want to play director and isolate themselves from everyone else."
techtheatre,3d666e,VioletVeruca,2,Tue Jul 14 06:10:33 2015 UTC,Right on... You made several solid points that make me wish I was as smart as you when I was 18.  :)

techtheatre,3d666e,VioletVeruca,3,Tue Jul 14 05:47:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 85%, although I think there are more important things to have a learning moment about with an assistant, other than a comic.  I think the vast majority of the people who read the comic (and participate in this sub) are not the people who ever see the industry at it's larger, more commercial, and surprisingly more ""theater family"" side and sometimes do see it as Us v Them (I know that I was guilty of that when I was a youngin')."

In college I was trying to impress a girl who was directing a student production of Vampire Lesbians of Sodom and needed a sound designer. I enjoyed doing it, and wound up running sound and then designing for every production there. And I've worked on every show I could since then. I found that when I couldn't get much work with my degree, the theatre was still paying for audio work, so I kept on it."

techtheatre,3d666e,St_Meow,5,Mon Jul 13 23:03:16 2015 UTC,"Hi, Steve! I too am a sound designer, but with very little visual artistic talent. Any time I see a costume designer doodling a quick mock-up I am blown away, and a little envious. Do you have any suggestions for honing those drawing skills? Is it worth it to take classes?  Also, do you have any theatre superstitions that you revere, or any traditions or rituals before tech or opening night?"
techtheatre,3d666e,dansoundtheatre,3,Mon Jul 13 23:14:44 2015 UTC,"Practice. I'm a lackluster visual artist, too, but over the last 200 comics, my art has improved considerably because I'm drawing every day now. Even if you're not taking classes, it helps to be a student in other ways. I've read a ton of comics and I look very closely at how other artists do their line work, and some of it I put away and try to incorporate. I feel like I've developed a sense of my own style now, and the comics are becoming more and more consistent, but I'm always working on it and always looking for ways to improve.   I'm not superstitious, but I'm not a jerk to those who are. When I'm testing a sound system, I like to use Rusted Root's Send Me On My Way, not as a tradition, so much as because I have a strong sense for what the song should sound like, and it always puts me in a good mood before the show."

In addition to sound and AV design, I worked as part of the illustration for the projections. The other illustrator on the team was my 6 year old niece. For two days we doodled nights and robots and dragons and landscapes together and then they got blown up 30 feet high. The night my niece got to come to the show was incredible for me. So that one is special.   My least favorite job came the year after I graduated college. I got hired back on at my college as a designer and mentor. That year our space got hit for mold remediation. They threw out everything. Everything. The school kept no inventory of what was discarded. Probably the biggest loss was all of our lighting cables. We still have a theory that some one scrapped it for the copper. We were doing Godot that semester and would up in the music hall with essentially no equipment and no budget. It was just awful. We got back into the space the following year, but the space is shut down again for renovations.   I'm glad that you all are enjoying the comics!"

techtheatre,3d666e,Zipdog3,3,Mon Jul 13 21:51:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, the comic is my primary source of income, and I work six or seven days a week on it, both the actual creation of the strips, and in the shop, doing commission work, and other business things.   I would love to do it 5 times a week. If it got to that point, we'd start to see a lot more narrative work.

techtheatre,3d4w0n,fizzak,4,Tue Jul 14 22:40:19 2015 UTC,"This actually looks fairly legit, if I understand you correctly that the upper pipe is sitting atop an existing trustworthy pipe structure.  The existing grid supports the added pipe against any downward load.  The pipe is lashed to the grid, preventing it from moving around laterally.  The other end of the added pipe should have also been secured.  But assuming there's no substantial lateral/diagonal load, then lashing the added pipe (on both ends) seems perfectly valid.  There may be fire-safety regulations locally that call for a steel attachment or safety, so that the pipe remains aloft (temporarily) even in the event of a fire that burns away soft goods.  But with the added pipe sitting atop the existing grid, it's staying up even in the event of fire, so I think you'd be fine there.  I'm not a certified rigger, so of course please take this all with a grain of salt.  As a professional stagehand, I wouldn't be too horrified to run into this.  But yeah, I'd replace it with a couple of cheeseboros if available."

techtheatre,3d4r2z,Pyro_Cat,6,Mon Jul 13 15:29:14 2015 UTC,"-Shackles are pointing in the right direction  -Eyebolt has a washer  -Dangling chain should have been placed above the shackle rather than next to it, but its so much better than a side-loaded shackle.  -I don't love the turnbuckle hooks, but as far as we can tell, its only holding up some 2x. Since the space is set for an event and the only other things in the air similar are just holding up some blacks, I assume that's this thing's purpose too. If that's true, the turnbuckles are absolutely rated high enough to support that weight.  -The shackles and buckle aren't moused, but if the earlier assumption is correct, the unit shouldn't be moving and would thus be exceedingly unlikely to need mousing. (Obv would be better with some though)  Overall, a small handful of bad marks, but even with them, it is well over safety requirements for a stick with some softgoods on it up for a short event. So I'd say most of it"

There is absolutely no way to tell this from the photo.  For all we know the turnbuckle was originally from something made for Ikea, and these bolts happen to fit.

techtheatre,3d4r2z,notacrook,5,Mon Jul 13 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"Lighting is an art (except for the whole power part). There should be no creativity when it comes to rigging. There is a standard and its a standard for a reason. If you don't have the gear to meet that standard, then go get the gear.   That is all non-negotiable.

You can apply that thought process to every rig you do. I am not a rigger in the sense that I do not design rigs by trade. But using common sense I can tell you that your 30 degree bridle is way to steep to carry your load properly. Or that using a threaded eyebolt as your only point on a dynamic load, yeah probably not a good idea. I've seen both.   Everything will always work until it won't work anymore. With AV its not a big deal when something breaks. It's a bummer, but you just fix or replace it. When something breaks with rigging people get hurt.  Just do it the right way. Steel is cheap. The right way is usually easier than trying some crazy rig. There is not really an excuse not to."

techtheatre,3d4r2z,imakethenews,0,Mon Jul 13 20:28:58 2015 UTC,"Yes it does - if you side-load it. Up or down is fine, side to side can allow for load-shifting and rolling since shackles are ovular. A nudge leading to a roll will knock around and affect the trim of whatever's on the end at the very least.  Doesn't need a washer, but it does help keep the bolt from getting tightened too deeply into the lumber if some inexperienced carp comes in thinking they're fixing something  See side load jumping issue from 1. The issue is that the dangling chain is pushing the shackle from the actual bottom of the link it rests on.  And we agree on mousing then"

techtheatre,3d7xut,Newtotouring,5,Tue Jul 14 05:25:36 2015 UTC,"The situation you describe is what happens in the VEE and possibly Feld pink contracts.  I don't think that the daily max amount is actually written into the contract -- in fact, I don't think the contract says anything about housing.  On the higher level family show contracts (like Dora and Diego and such), as well as lower-end contracts with companies like Troika and Networks and Worklight, double-occupancy housing is provided at no cost to the employee, while per diem is set around $35 or $45 or so a day.  There's no longer an arbitrary split between salary and per diem in the contract -- there's a salary minimum (above which sometimes an employee can negotiate) and a given per diem.    The next level up would be the larger contracts with Troika and Networks and the lower contracts (specifically the ""SETA"" contract) with the Broadway League or Disney (Disney Theatricals, which produces shows like Newsies and Lion King, not to be confused with Feld, which does the Disney Live and Disney on Ice shows).  Under these contracts the employee can choose to have a single occupancy room provided and receive a per diem of around $40-$50, or get a double occupancy room and receive $50-$60, or have no housing provided and get $80-$90.  One more level up from there also includes some of the larger NETworks or Troika shows and the middle-level League/Disney shows (this is called the ""modified"" contract.)  There's a per diem of around $120-$130, and single-occupancy hotels are booked by the company but the employee pays for them.  Two hotel options are given, and the average cost of the cheaper of the two has to be $75/night (with some stipulations on how the average is determined.)    (It's worth noting that the SETA, modified, and full contract (coming up next) options are related to the housing requirements in their equivalent Equity contracts for the actors and stage managers.)  Finally, there's the full pink contract, which is used by a handful of large Broadway touring shows.  The per diem is $130-$140 and the employer provides a few housing options to get group rates but there aren't any price restrictions.  Employees pay for their own housing."

They are for broad strokes, and if you set up your console and system processor in a logical way, you have a really handy tool for refining the levels around the theatre.  The matrix on a DiGiCo is no different than the matrix on other digital consoles/processors, except that there are also nodes for delays, I doubt you need those yet.  On A DiGiCo you can define what your matrix inputs are. For instance, you can say that your matrix inputs are groups 1-16 or maybe you want an aux to go to the matrix; a sub mix perhaps? Your groups would be things like principal vox, ensemble vox, band, drums, reverb, effects; things that you might want to attenuate the level of zone by zone.  The matrix outputs typically go through your system processor (Galileo, soundweb, XTA, zillions more) and relate to physical parts of your system. In the processor you can break down systems even further. You have a front fill mix from the matrix, now it's in the Galileo and there are 3 front fill outputs with different level/delay/eq. Your Left/Right might break down line arrays into 2-4 or more outputs."
techtheatre,3d69pc,jraat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:23:06 2015 UTC,"Haven't used them on the ""T"" series so can't help on that, but I will explain why matrixes, as I understand them anyway. The essentially allow you to easily set a different mix very quickly for different speakers. So your groups to your matrixes will be ""vocals"", ""band"", ""click"" etc. Your outputs are your speakers (pros left/right"", ""delays"", ""front fills"". Now if you have a band in front of the stage in the pit, let's say something with a lot of acoustic instruments like Singing in the Rain, you won't need much band in your front fills so you only dial in a little of your band matrix into your front fill output. But the people at the back can't hear the acoustic pit instruments as they are too far away, but with a quick twist of a virtual knob you can put, for example, 12dB more orchestra in your delays.   Some designers love them for their flexibility and to get everything theoretically perfect. Others dislike it as unless done carefully with time and plenty of crew you can end up with seats with dodgy sound, if you send the same mix to ever speaker then every seat should be roughly the same."

I also suggest having it one sided. This is so you can have a blank page for cues/other information. Use a line to link your cues to the cue point in the script.  The script should be the same as that of the director and cast. Everyone in the production should have the same version. If you have the time to retype and distribute to all cast & creatives then go for it."

techtheatre,3d2rzv,LandGod,5,Mon Jul 13 01:46:00 2015 UTC,"I've done both, and I like theatre a lot more. On a film, you could spend weeks busting your ass working on something, then wait a year for the film to come out, only to see that the scene was cut. In theatre, the results are more immediate. You load in a show, and you hear an audience on opening night. For some reason I like that more.  There's also hours of down time working on a film, followed by minutes of working as hard as you possibly can.   I got into this business wanting to work in film, and I after I did a little of both, I stuck with theatre."

techtheatre,3d2rzv,Pyro_Cat,4,Mon Jul 13 02:39:24 2015 UTC,"I can answer that! Electrics (Sparks) run power management and distro. Grips work on rigging (mainly camera rigging). So Trusses, dolly tracks and clever mounts. Depending on the region grips also may cover light stands, but sometimes that falls to the gaffer, who is in charge of lighting the set.   So in U/pyro_cat 's comment, the people asking for something 9 times out of ten are gaffers.  Also, I know it seems silly to have all those people split up, but the reason is efficiency. Film has more specialization than theater (in my experience) because they have quick turnarounds to shave off the budget. So If you have only electrics handling power, they can work on finding the proper circuits at the location, running generators and distribution boxes. Oftentimes, films can't use regular location power because of the draw, so they need to tap into higher voltage sources, rather than use outlets. (Theaters are great, we already have the power!)"

In film they show up with a truck full of lights and mostly figure out everything day of on site. In theatre you might load in for a few days with only other technicians on site. In film most of the work is being done while everyone ( director, actors, camera crew, audio crew, ++ ) is waiting and looking at you. In theatre you hang a light with a clamp on a pipe. In film you put a light on a stand and move it 10 times, gel lights that were not designed to be gelled, and setup 10'x10' scrims for reasons I can not figure out. In theatre if deemed worthy you might have a radio on your belt, in film there is a radio in your ear that you can't avoid and slows you down.

techtheatre,3cy3gi,soph0nax,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:12:13 2015 UTC,"Rear projection works depending on the surface and how bright the projectors are, sometimes they work worse in daylight settings because the surface will catch more bounce light and it actually washout the projection completely. Depending on the budget sometimes you can't get a goo rear project screen and have to make one, then you have a big annoying hot spot you're looking at, and most cases the throw isn't far enough for how big you would want the projection to be, in that case mirrors might come into play but then there's more budget and brightness goes down. Though it may work, there's more budget needed for rear projection when front projection can be possibly mapped to the set in a tasteful way instead, sometimes not having to buy and screen."

techtheatre,3cwa3g,Tinbum89,5,Sun Jul 12 19:49:19 2015 UTC,"Moving head lights need three times as much attention as regular lights - one part because they're lights, one part because they're moving, and one part because they are both.  :-)  It's really easy to get cables tangled.  Everything cable must be fastened throughout its travel - you don't want it to shake loose and foul the motion. Make sure you have a test pattern that exercises all the lights in full range of motion.  If you have multiple lights, they might all start to do the same fast pattern at the same point in a show.  I have set up banks of such lights, not tested the whole show, and then seen a whole bank of lights undulate rhythmically because of the masses being moved around together - no damage done but looked very unprofessional (and will cause failure if you keep doing it in the same space).  If you are doing this repeatedly on a permanent installation, make sure to check fastenings every couple of shows to make sure that the repeated forces haven't loosened things, or worst case caused cracks (or stress fractures, except you almost certainly won't be able to detect this, which is why you diligently check for everything else).  Be aware of light ""hotspots"" on the ground when focusing.  I was at some show as audience where for whatever reason, one location on the floor got a very large number of moving lights going through it almost every time they ran them.  It was annoying and people were dancing with their hands shielding their eyes - but 10' away in any direction, it was fine.   I love moving head lights and with a little care, you can have a lot of fun with them!"

The house setup changes almost every show: full proscenium, 3/4"" thrust (short-ways and long-ways in our rectangular space), alley, even full in-the-round. The change takes about 2 days, works like a dream, and was a top-priority for the architects when the theatre was constructed inside a historic building. They were so proud to have a gotten a 200-butt seating capacity out of such a small space.  BUT. There's nowhere on-site to store the pieces of the reconfigurable seating. Which means renting a box truck to haul it off-site for every changeover. Which means negotiating with the city to block access to one of their historic buildings for an afternoon, since the theatre  also doesn't have a loading dock.  It could be a lot worse... but it could be a lot better."

Edit: I want to add a little more.  The way this happens is:  ""We need to cut 10% out of the project, we're over budget.""  finishes get cheaper, light fixtures get less fancy  ""OK, we need to cut another 5%, we're still over budget.""  There's not a lot else to cut, can the client find any more money?  ""No, no more money in the budget.""  OK, so we need to reduce square footage by 5%, what's expendable?  ""Well, all of this [lobby, classrooms, offices, theatres, toilets, elevators, hallways] is programmed requirements.   We can't cut that.   How about all this storage space, can they just rent space offsite?""  Storage is really important to the functioning of the theatre, but they could rent a truck if they had to.  ""It seems to be we either cut the storage or we eliminate a theatre.""  Cutting storage it is!    I also know of a university performing arts center that was getting cut down (in the ""let's cut some classrooms"" sense), it hit a point that we got an e-mail from the faculty that said ""If you need to cut anything else, let's not build the building.""  Which I thought was a wise course of action.    Buildings stick around for at least 50 years, if you don't have the money to build what you need, it might be better to wait (or phase)."

(There is no grid).  No static power outlets at all on the catwalk at all, forcing us to run an extension cable up from the ground in order to power the spotlights Dimmer packs in the dimmer rack that are addressed but have no actual output anywhere in the space A very limited amount of dimmers at all, with a total of 96 channels, 10 of which are for house/work lights Very limited control over auxiliary outputs in the audio system, and delay speakers that may or may not actually work   This is mostly because the system wasn't, as you said in your post, designed by theater people.

I thought triggers like this were simple, like the magnets that hold doors open: If the alarm sounds, power is disconnected.  That way it's fail-safe.  Doesn't having a battery backup reduce the ""safe"" part of that?  Edit: I should say that I see that the backup battery is mentioned in the product detail on the JR Clancy page, I'm just not understanding the intent of it.  Edit2: I was imagining this as being a simple matter of alarm sounds, power to this box shuts off, curtain comes in.  But I think now that there must be a separate fire alarm signal (maybe low-voltage) and the mains power is just doing the work.  So, I retract my confusion. :)"
techtheatre,3ctpa7,kmccoy,5,Sat Jul 11 00:31:25 2015 UTC,"The battery is presumably for when the power goes out but there is not a fire. I would guess that the fire alarm system bypasses the battery backup. If not, that is a truly awful design."

As in, we got a fresh case of tape at the beginning of each school year, and that was supposed to last all year long. That was literally the only thing in the theatre that the district paid for. Everything else was paid for by the theatre's ticket sales - All the district funding went to the local magnet school's auditorium, even though our theatre program was far superior to theirs.  So all of our lumber, paint, props, drops, etc., were either made from things we had laying around, or bought by the theatre's booster club, (which was basically the theatre's treasury.)

techtheatre,3ctpa7,Mr_Cumbox,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:37:50 2015 UTC,"I'm actually at a gig right now, where the loading dock is four rooms away from the venue. As in, they built classrooms in between the loading dock and the venue, so you need to go through the classes to load anything in or out.  On that same note, my high school's auditorium originally didn't have a bay door. The TD would constantly bitch to the district, and the district would simply respond, ""no, you don't need one. You've managed to go without one so far, haven't you?"" This went on until the district had someone else come after them - They had a big pop star (who will remain unnamed) come in to do a concert... The crew had to load everything in through the classroom doors - Their road cases and racks were too big to fit through the doorways, so they had to unload all of their stuff and unrack all of their sound equipment, (all the audio techs just cringed,) and carry it in by hand. After the show, the district got a very nasty letter, and the school had a loading dock + bay door built before summer was out.  Edit: Remembered another one... The city runs a local theatre. It's very nice, but one of their biggest problems is that there isn't a house rail for lights - They only have box booms on the sides. The annoying part is that there is a balcony which has a rail attached to the bottom edge... But there isn't any way to reach it from the bottom, (they'd have to remove the audience seats to get a scissor lift up there,) and they glued the hatches shut when they built the theatre. Like, the edge of the balcony (right in front of the first row of seats) actually hinges up, and allows access to that rail by just leaning over the edge... But they glued those hinged hatches shut, and ungluing them would wreck the finish on the wood. The result is that they have a giant dark spot directly in the center of the stage - The first electric is too steep to hit it, and the box booms are too far away... Also, the lighting booth is above the balcony, and the sight lines are awful. You can only see about 1/3 of the stage... So they move the light board down to the center of the house for programming."

Besides, this isn't a 'design' problem. It was an install problem. The electrician probably put it in the most logical spot at the time. However, the curtain wasn't installed at the time it was put in so the mistake wasn't his fault. The people that put in the curtain weren't electricians and aren't there to supervise the electricians, so they wouldn't care about that. Guaranteed. No, what happened was there should be a theater technician also serving as a supervisor to the building project. Before the commissioning was finished, someone should have caught this mistake and put it on the list of corrections before the building was signed over.

techtheatre,3crph8,shiftingtech,2,Fri Jul 10 15:59:27 2015 UTC,Hey thanks. I figured out the solution before u could post this but that's exactly why was wrong. The faders where on manual timing.

techtheatre,3crph8,Kamala_Metamorph,2,Fri Jul 10 21:23:52 2015 UTC,"Ooh! I love Strand! Except... this doesn't sound familiar. :-/   Hm. I wonder if the go button got written over with a cut command somehow?   Here's a soft copy of the manual: http://www.strandlighting.com/clientuploads/directory/downloads/500series_operationmanual.pdf  I did a search for "" Cut"", then ""override"" and ""default tim"", and read through the chapter on Running Cues. Does any of that sound like the problem?  You can check the Default Times window, though that shouldn't be the problem, since you said that the cues had written timings in it. I assume you are working with conventional lighting? Or are they intelligent lights or effects, bc those could have other reasons.   Any more information, or else let us know if you fix it, I'm very interested in the solution for this.   edit: Actually, I think /u/shiftingtech above has the right solution. Do a search in the manual for Time Fader or Manual Time. That's probably what's overriding your cue times.  edit 2: After you fix your first problem, I gave someone here a great pdf of Strand Cheat Sheets I got from LDI  a while back. Here's the link:  https://np.reddit.com/r/techtheatre/comments/2scgzt/we_found_a_magic_button_rel_pb_who_knew/cnz8neo"

There's no need to say more than that to a prospective employer. Let your work and your attitude speak for themselves and you'll be fine. Assuming your work and your attitude are good, that is :-p"
techtheatre,3cot09,mikewoodld,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:54:28 2015 UTC,"Seconded. There's really no clearly-defined line that you cross to go from the ""amateur"" side to the ""professional"" side; It's a constant gradient that everyone sits along.  mikewoodid is right in that regardless of what you call yourself, always always approach work with the attitude of a professional; do a good job, work safely, ask and learn what you don't know and pass along that which you do, and try to get along well with others.

When I graduated I just told prospective employers I was a carpenter/rigger.  Though if you want to get technical about it, ""amateur"" really means you do something unpaid, or as a hobby. ""Professional"" just means that you're paid to do it whether you're good or bad at it. ""Professional"" is very different from ""expert"" or ""master"", which both mean you're actually really good at what you do."

techtheatre,3ckxhg,PixelFelon,3,Wed Jul 8 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"What controllers did you buy? Is the power input screw terminals? You do need (most likely, can't say for sure without knowing the controller) a 12V power supply, as those LEDs are 12V. If you have an extra computer power supply hanging around (or have a nearby computer shop you can get one from), you can repurpose it as a general purpose fixed voltage power supply. Just chop the connectors off the ends of the PSU, and hook the 12V (yellow) and ground (black) lines up to your LED controller. Any reasonable PSU will be 20A-25A on the 12V line, so one would be sufficient for one or two LED controllers."

techtheatre,3ckxhg,ltjpunk387,2,Wed Jul 8 20:03:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have been more clear (I have bit of tunnel vision from doing this quite often). You need a PSU from a desktop computer. Something like this. Most laptop power supplies are going to be higher voltage (as you've noticed). A generic/ordinary ATX PSU can be had for $20-30 at a shop like Fry's Electronics or from many places online with fast shipping."
techtheatre,3ckxhg,PixelFelon,3,Wed Jul 8 20:10:05 2015 UTC,You'll also need to use a paperclip or bit of wire to short circuit the PS_ON wire (green on the big connector) to any of the black wires in order for the power supply to turn on.
techtheatre,3ckxhg,PixelFelon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:30:48 2015 UTC,There are so many black wires. Can I tie the green into a black? A paper clip seems dangerous. Maybe I'm confused at what your saying.  Edit: thank you! Couldn't have figured it out without this step.
techtheatre,3ckxhg,MrYfe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:17:53 2015 UTC,All of the black wires are ground. It doesn't matter which one. You could either cut and tie or use a paperclip. The green wire is a low voltage signal wire. It's basically just checking to see if there's continuity from it to ground. There's no danger with a paperclip.
techtheatre,3ckxhg,mikewoodld,2,Thu Jul 9 20:07:10 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I bought a power supply, but I'm a bit overwhelmed at the wires coming out the back. Nothing is labeled. There's like 10 yellows and 10 blacks... I cut a yellow and a black from what I think is the 12v supply, but they did not give my controler power. How do I know which to use? There is no wiring diagram or anything.  Having trouble uploading a pic to imgur of the unit."
techtheatre,3ckxhg,Thermodrama,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:15:48 2015 UTC,"There is also a green wire coming off the unit. That needs to get connected to any black wire (solder it, twist it, paperclip it, whatever). That powers on the supply. After it's on, any yellow and any black wire will do. I don't know how power in your theatre is set up, but don't put it on a dimmable outlet if possible."

Used on several shows this year. I just cut the connector off and used the wires right into the DMX decoders.  16' is no problem. There's a definite drop if you add a second tape in, both in overall intensity and by the time you get to the end of the 32', the end is dimmer than the beginning. With 16' (one tape) there were no problems.   If you have more problems, let me know. I've done a whole bunch of 5050SMB stuff this season."
techtheatre,3ckxhg,xTheFreeMason,2,Wed Jul 8 20:04:56 2015 UTC,"If you've still got the link to the LED strip handy specs shouldn't be too hard to find. Remember with that current, you're looking at the 100% brightness level, unless you intend to run them that high you could use smaller supplies.   Sounds like the 3x4A is what the DMX controllers are rated for, so you'd need more as you add more strip."
techtheatre,3ckxhg,turnby,2,Wed Jul 8 19:02:22 2015 UTC,"Be careful with that stuff. I bought that exact reel and it came with the blue and green wires soldered backwards for some reason.

I'm looking to install a couple of box booms in a theatre I work for. The walls are solid concrete (built in the late 30's). I'm trying to decide the best way to construct the booms.  Current thought is wedge anchors into the wall which will hold a flange with an 18"" piece of 1-1/2"" schedule 40 threaded into it. Then simply cheese borough or rotolock this pipe to my vertical.   Thoughts? Easier solution? Thanks for looking!"

techtheatre,3chess,MrYfe,3,Tue Jul 7 22:48:22 2015 UTC,"In that price range, I would seriously recommend Shure's QLX-D to you. The work they've done with frequency management and the likes is impressive. I'd suggest you chat with /u/cstucks. He's the /r/livesound RF pro. Really knows his stuff.   In terms of mics, Countryman E6's are usually considered the budget mics with DPA being the higher end here. You may also consider hairmics depending on your space. They're usually a little cheaper.  Always remember this: microphones for theater are CONSUMABLES. They are not an SM58. They will not last forever. Buy the mic with the knowledge that it will have to be replaced, and will die or be broken.  Edit: To expand on QLX: I've been a loyal Sennheiser for years. Sennheiser wireless was always what I wanted and used whenever possible. However, a company I freelance bought some of the QLX-D units and I was floored. The build quality of the mic packs is fantastic. Equal to the Sennheisers, sound is largely the same, but the big two things that sold me over similarly priced Senns. are as follows:   Replaceable antenna. Theatre is theatre. Actors are rough on equipment; things get broken. That is the nature of things. I always had problems with the Sennheiser antennas. The shielding on them would get peeled off all the time. But the QLX-D has replaceable antennas. Actor rips one off? No problem. Relatively easy and inexpensive fix.  The big place where QLX-D shines is frequency efficiency and management. Don't let the digital confuse you, these are UHF units, but encode and transmit the audio digitally. Sort of like analog radio vs. digital radio. The amount of units you can fit in a band is much higher than traditional wireless and the susceptibility to interference is greatly diminished. Just having the ability to fit more units per band is a big plus for me. I may be getting some of the details wrong. If so, again, /u/cstucks is someone you really need to talk to.    Additionally, the rechargeable batteries for QLX really appeal to me. You can get rechargeable batteries and docking stations. I haven't gotten to use them, but to me this seems a fantastic option to reduce consumable usage.  Edit 2: Oh! QLX-D also has much more powerful management options. You can control and sync all of them from your computer. They're all networkable. The Senns. are too but I believe the Shure's have more options.   Basically I think you should research these. They're slightly cheaper and way more feature packed and reliable IMO. Trust me, brand loyalty isn't always worth it."
techtheatre,3chess,LeAudiophile,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:28:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for a great and thorough answer! I will heed your advice and try to get hold of /u/cstucks, although as I understand they have a lot to do :)  I will also check out QLX-D, thanks for the tip. The one thing that always bugged me about Shures wireless series is the build quality of their handheld mics. As far as I know they're always made of plastic (from the pictures it looks like the QLX-D hh are too, is this correct?), while Senns use metal; which means I can give them to meat balls with no brains without having to worry about them breaking the mics ... is this worry real?  That headworn mics are consumables is something I probably will have to knock into my head ... I'd love for them to never be replaced, but as I understand that's just not going to happen :p"
techtheatre,3chess,LeAudiophile,2,Wed Jul 8 01:20:30 2015 UTC,"QLX-D is almost exclusively metal. That's another thing that sold me. Housing was always one of the things that the Senns sold me on. Their handhelds were on par with Sennheisers in terms of weight and feel.  Here's Shure's first look video for QLX-D (source)   If you have anyone in your area that has QLX-D and the Senns., I would try to check both out for yourself and see which you like better. IMO Shure really upped the ante with QLX-D (most likely because Senn. was kicking their ass when in came to lower-end/cost-effective gear.). I probably wouldn't have become a fan had it not been for actually using them. They're quickly becoming popular with corporate A/V peeps, so I'd see if any rental companies have any they'd be willing to demo."
techtheatre,3chess,LeAudiophile,2,Wed Jul 8 11:42:48 2015 UTC,"Great! That takes away my biggest concern about the Shures :D  I have a lot more experience with Senn than Shure. The only Shure system I've used is the UR4, which is kindof out of our price range ... Do you know how well the QLX-D holds up to that?"
techtheatre,3chess,gocanux,2,Wed Jul 8 13:10:45 2015 UTC,"The last time I worked with a UR4 was long, long ago. I didn't get to work much with the QLX in terms of their software, etc., but they seemed comparable to most of the Senn. gear. They do still adhere to the group/channel system that most of Shure's gear does, but I believe they also can cater to the more advance user and sync manually. The Shures do lack the receiver/transmitter naming that the Senns have, which can be nice for theatre as the name of who it belongs to is on the LCD, and not tape which can come off. However, with a computer, I believe it is the case that they can all be synced at once, and they will find the freqs. with the least interference and space themselves out correct. I only briefly got to work with them regretfully, so I'm hardly an expert here. I do think that working with them yourself would be really advantageous to you. There's only so much talking and the internet can do. I'd talk to your equipment dealer as well, and see what he thinks (assuming he knows a lot more about you and your situation than I). He'll also be factoring in price to the equation as well. The one big thing you do lose (and it was a bummer for me) is the Senn. handhelds. You would be stuck with the Shure capsules. Honestly if the EW 500 and QLX-D had a baby we'd have a damn near perfect wireless IMO. I'm really hoping though that QLX-D with spark a fire under Senn. to get them to release a similar product and update their stuff. G3 is at least 5 years old now, and with how quickly the face of wireless is changing and how quickly we're loosing available airwaves, it's time for something new. I'm hoping G4 will be along soon."

techtheatre,3chess,Adolpheappia,2,Wed Jul 8 18:52:17 2015 UTC,"QLX-D is great. ULX-D is more expensive but it's even better. Gives you Dante, 2- and 4-channel receivers, better spacing, etc. Definitely more expensive, but they're really nice."

techtheatre,3chess,LeAudiophile,3,Sun Jul 12 15:11:01 2015 UTC,"Well, they aren't cheap, but Countryman E6 mics are awesome, and have a minimal visual profile while still providing great sound. I've used them for musicals, and as long as they stay in place (lots of tape), they are excellent.   However, if your director doesn't like visible mics, then you'll have to look at lavs (not good) or hairline mics (much better). IME lavs placed on a lapel pick up a whole lot of clothing/prop noise, and can get displaced on complicated costumes."
techtheatre,3chess,whiteside1013,3,Tue Jul 7 23:16:46 2015 UTC,"We run exclusively with E6s. They sound fabulous.  I have to say, though, for heavy dance shows the mic wire is very flimsy and I recommend the larger (2mm i think) wire - it holds up much better."

Thanks in advance :p"
techtheatre,3chess,producermpd,3,Wed Jul 8 01:24:35 2015 UTC,"3M surgical tape is pretty good. If the actors are bouncing around a lot, then you may need sticker stuff and you may also need to retape mid-show. Haven't used the HPS2, so I can't help you there.  As far as hairline mics, tape very well at the base of the head (C5-T1 or so). Hairline mics work best with hats or lots of hair."
techtheatre,3chess,producermpd,2,Wed Jul 8 01:59:11 2015 UTC,"+1 for 3M surgical. Also, swab where you are going to tape down with an alcohol swap prior to taping. You want the tape sticking to the skin, not to makeup/sweat/grease. Have someone backstage you trust to retake actors. It does happen. I buy everything in double. One for micing area, one for backstage."
techtheatre,3chess,cstucks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:31:48 2015 UTC,"I prefer the HPS2. I have to carve the shit out of the E6 on the eq to get the tone I want. HPS2 sounds pretty much on point from the get go, just some light eq to adjust for the wearers voice."

techtheatre,3chess,cstucks,3,Wed Jul 15 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"The QLXD has the same guts at the ULXD but with several missing pieces which explains the lower price point.  In my opinion I really cannot see how the EW500 are even comparable to the QLXD at this point. Sennheiser spent so much time and money on the 9000 series that all of their other lines suffered, they've admitted that. The EW500 is an old system that has been surpassed by many new models, specifically the ULXD and QLXD. Shure made a superior RF product and a better sound wireless link in my opinion. Shure's monitoring software is superior to Sennheiser, but quite some margin, and with the rechargeable battery set-up it's a no brainer.  Happy to answer any questions you may have."
techtheatre,3chess,cstucks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:31:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for popping by!  I think my first question would be about the distinction between the different Shure systems. I just headed over their site and saw they have ten about systems running (blx,pgx-d,glx-d,fp,slx,ulx-s,qlx-d,ulx-d,uhf-r,axient).   I'm used to Senn, and even though they have the XSW, EM 100/300/500, EM 9046, EM 1046, EM 3732, EM 2000 and the EM D1 (as I just checked their site), I've only ever seen the EM 500 used. Now I guess the 9000's being installed in some HOWs and theatres, but the only ""serious"" product before this was the 500 if I've understood this correctly.  Now, Axient is their leading digital system IIUC and I guess can be compared to the 9000s, but where do the others fall? You said EM 500 is really lagging behind, but where would you put it on the Shure tree (if you had to)?  I'm sorry if this seems like a really convoluted way of asking, and perhaps it's easier to ask if you know of some site/paper that's already compared the different systems. The short version of this question is what system wouldn't you even bother using, and what is the best system at an affordable price?  Also: Do you know if Shure har rackmountable charging station below the Axient system? I really don't want to drag around a bunch of small stations just to charge five to ten batteries.   Thanks in advance, and I'll probably have some more questions in the near future :)"
techtheatre,3chess,Graemetak,2,Thu Jul 9 10:12:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to individually lay out how each system fits in the hierarchy of all wireless products. That's something you need to do in order to figure out what you need to buy. If a wireless product fits your needs with its features and pricing, then buy it. But based on your knowledge shown in this post, you should call a distributor and get their recommendation.   You comments here are certainly confusing, and we have to set some things straight. The D9000 series is a spaceship compared to the EM500 moped. For example, the capsule alone for the D9000 series are more expensive than the entire EW500 system. These two systems are not remotely comparable or interchangeable. The only thing the have in common is the Sennheiser logo. I would use the EM500 as my drink coaster if I had D9000 on a show. I don't consider the EW500 series serious in comparison to the (discontinued)1046, 2000, (discontinued)3532 and 3732. The 2000 series is at least twice the wireless system as the EW500, and the 3732 with the 5000 series transmitters is at least 10x better than the EW500. Again, the D9000 series is 100x better than the 3732 system. I hope that puts it in some perspective. The EW500 is top-of-the-line musician-level wireless. I would not put it in the ""Pro Audio"" category. I'm sure others will disagree, but I can't imagine anyone who has used the 5000 series, 2000 series and 500 will place them in a different order than I did. Open to discussion on that point.  If I had to put the EW500 in the Shure tree(which you put in good order before) I would put it above the above the ULXS but below the QLXD. The Axient system is Shure's top-model but it is not digital. It is analog audio with an integrated digital control network. The ULXD and QLXD are Shure's only all-digital pro-level wireless system, the D9000 is Sennheiser's only all digital wireless system but the D9000 is not to be considered in the same conversation as the ULXD and QLXD. The D9000 out performs the Axient system. It is a spaceship and the Axient is a 747. Not comparable to the EW500, a Volkswagen. And then you have bicycles like the BLX and D1.  Yes, Shure's rechargeable batteries dock in a 1RU charger, up to 8 batteries(lav or handheld) can charge at once for the Axient, ULXD and QLXD. They are not the standard AA format rechargeable batteries, they are superior in every way."

By the way; was my comment confusing because I had no clue of the leagues between the 500 and 9000 (and the others)? or was there more to it than that? I'd love to know if I can shed some light on the matter :)  Will definitely call a distributor about this, just have to wait untill summer's over.

techtheatre,3chess,Graemetak,2,Thu Jul 9 17:14:46 2015 UTC,"I'll try to hit answers for most of your questions throughout this thread:  Mic: Please don't get anything like the HSP2. That kind of mic is for corporate speaking stuff where no one cares about seeing the big, hulking microphone. Theatre is about the magic. The more invisible the better. Small mic elements like the Countryman B6 can hide very well, and sound great. If you don't mind the ear mounting, you could do the E6 as well. If you can afford slightly more, check out the DPA 4061; they sound fantastic, but are physically bigger. Make sure to get a variety of colors to match hair/skin color.  Mounting: This site has some great techniques. I usually use the wig clip method. Hairline mounting usually sounds the best, but some actors don't have the power to make it work well. Then, I go to cheek mount. I really dislike homemade ear rigs like on that page. I prefer to just run the cable over the ear and tape. Usually the best sounding place for cheek will be just under the cheekbone, but it can vary from face to face.  Speaking of tape, I use 3M Transpore. It's a medical tape that is designed to stick to skin and not sweat off. The key is proper prep before taping. The skin needs to be clean of dirt/oil. Easiest way is bulk buy some alcohol prep pads. Clean the skin and immediately tape. It should stay for the whole show. If doing around the ear mounting, tape just behind the mic head, run the cable over the ear and tape at bottom of ear, then run it to center of neck (following hairline) and tape again. Make sure to leave flex room for them turning their head.  Hats can be either a huge problem or no problem at all for hair mics. It depends on brim shape and material. Hard, concave brims like a baseball cap or military hat will funnel sound into the mic. Usually this sounds strange and artificial, like they're talking through a megaphone. Hats with soft brims or upturned brims are usually no trouble. Just make sure the hat doesn't actually cover the mic."

It's not something I know and the characters mean NOTHING to me, they are purely random cartoon people. The only thing that says it is anything to do with theatre is the mixing desk on the left hand side of the image.

The middle character with a blond ponytail has beard scruff, the redhead has what looks like a goatee. Is Rambo supposed to be a woman? I thought she had facial hair too.   I'm relieved to hear that there's such good representation on your header. I'm still concerned because, had I not asked, I would've continued to assume that the comic didn't include me. I wouldn't have taken the second look to scrutinize the header, and going over to spend 5 minutes at Q2Q didn't put my mind at ease. And most people don't ask. It would've continued to be a bummer. :-/ So... I'd honestly appreciate if you and Steve just thought about it.  Thanks so much."

techtheatre,3cc8tt,J3ssicaR4bbit,6,Mon Jul 6 19:59:09 2015 UTC,"An issue is that 1950s photo flashes were flashbulbs - bulbs filled with O2 and a magnesium filament which was ignited. Naturally they were single-use and the bulb was extremely hot for a while after ignition.  So taking several in a row isn't historically accurate, but that's the job so... Obviously using a real 50s flash is right out unless you want to burn actor's fingers off.  Disposable camera flashes are also unsuitable because they rely on cheap capacitors which take time to build up charge, so they'll fire a few times a minute at most, and make a whiny sound. Also be aware there's a lot of charge going through those things, they make wonderful mini shocks.  You're probably best off getting a secondhand SLR flashgun and putting the workings inside your prop housing, paying attention to the flash interval, which is the time it takes to recharge the capacitors and fire again. 3 seconds is fairly common, but you can get speed flash units which take as little as 0.1 seconds."
techtheatre,3cc8tt,listyraesder,2,Mon Jul 6 21:12:46 2015 UTC,"All very good points. If you have access to SLR flash units, could you instead secure them to one of your electrics and trigger them with a cheap radio remote from the camera? As long as the prop is pointed upstage I imagine the effect would sell convincingly enough. And a remote would be easier to hide than the guts of a speedlight."
techtheatre,3cc8tt,ceramic,5,Tue Jul 7 01:09:36 2015 UTC,"If you're going to hang something from the electrics you might as well get a dedicated strobe so you can control it from the console. If you're on a budget though, I'm sure someone's made a C-clamp that terminates in a 1/4"" tripod screw."
techtheatre,3cc8tt,Gaff_Tape,2,Tue Jul 7 02:05:22 2015 UTC,"The stage is in the round, so the flash really need to come from the camera itself, no matter which way it is pointed the audience will see it."
techtheatre,3cc8tt,birdbrainlabs,4,Tue Jul 7 15:21:37 2015 UTC,"Does the flash need to be seen, or does the flash need to illuminate the actors?     We've built a cool little design using a 9V to charge a small capacitor that then discharges into a 10W white LED.  Two switchea;: one charges, one discharges.    Voltage never exceeds 9V so it's safe for handling.  (Disposable cameras operate at a few hundred volts)  It is not, however, bright enough to light the scene, but does serve as a nice bright pop on stage.    Let me.know and I'll dig up a parts list.   The LEDs are pretty expensive, but I think overall it was like $25 in parts and shipping."

techtheatre,3cc8tt,birdbrainlabs,2,Tue Jul 7 15:26:25 2015 UTC,"It's not much more complicated than that.    Basically: 1 switch between the battery and the cap, 1 switch between the cap and the LED.    A flash is a very brief thing, trying to do it with just a button is hard, it ends up looking like you're flashing a flashlight.   What the cap does is give you a very small reservoir of energy, so when you hit the button the LED discharges it in a few milliseconds, giving you a crisp flash with a tail.    The whole parts list was:   2 switches 9v clip 10w LED on a starboard 2 ohm resistor in case both switches were held open big (1F?) Capacitor   I have the actual parts list and a diagram on my computer and will update on a few hours (travelling at the moment)"

Having these technical abilities is not just important for the TD , but also the Scene Designer.  Being able to think in many different mediums, opens up the imagination.  Kinda like being able to think in different languages.  I always recommended our students interested in Tec Theatre  and/or design at least take courses in industrial arts.  For students interested in costume design/craft take relevant courses in the Home Ech. Dept. ( today generally called by other names). I recommend any one interested in Design take as much Art History as Possible.  This is useful to Scenic, Costume, and Lighting Designers.  It shows how people throughout the ages wanted to be seen (also useful to actors and directors). It's especially useful for lighting designers as it can show an awareness of what light can do and how people and objects were perceived in it.  This was something that painters could do at the time, which theatre couldn't equate, but sought to.  Although not a major, I think anyone interested in tech theatre should have training in First Aid.

The thing about college is that everyone is going to have a different answer and different experiences. To me, it’s all about what you make out of your time there. I went to a university with a relatively non-existent theatre design department. I can say that 70% of the things I learned about this work came from doing the work itself outside of college. The other 30% were things that I probably could have learned on my own as well, but being in an educational ""consequence-free"" environment made it much easier. (Things like basic drafting, design theories, etc.) On the flip side, I have former students who are studying at major design schools who are getting an amazing education in the art and craft of lighting. In a way, I'm super jealous of the education that they are getting and the experiences that they are getting because I can't help but wonder where I'd be if I would have had that too.  The biggest thing that college can do for you is networking. Not only with your fellow classmates, but with professors and instructors and industry professionals. The level of these networking connections is directly tied to the university itself. I didn't get much of that, unfortunately. I had to make my own connections and forge my own path - but it's brought me where I am and I'm proud of that.   You can only learn so much in school, really. This is a craft that has to be done and done several times before you really “master” it and I honestly don’t think that anyone really ever masters it. Always growing, always developing skills.   As for majoring in something else at the same time, that's up to you. I'm of the firm opinion that if you're serious about being a theatrical designer or technician full time, you put yourself 100% into it. If you can't imagine doing anything else with your life, then theatre is what you need to do. If you can imagine yourself doing something else, then do that instead and do theatre on the side.
