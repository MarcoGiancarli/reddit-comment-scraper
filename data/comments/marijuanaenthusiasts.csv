marijuanaenthusiasts,3e0xpc,multimedium,4,Tue Jul 21 02:48:30 2015 UTC,"This is my cherry tree, it came with the house. I do not know what kind of cherry tree it is, but its cherry's do not appear to be edible.  I would like to plant an edible cherry tree in my yard to harvest the fruit. My questions are: if I plant a sweet cherry tree could they cross pollinate rendering all of the fruit inedible? Do I need another sweet cherry tree to act as a polinizer?  People who have cherry trees, are they more trouble than they're worth?   Thanks for your help,"
marijuanaenthusiasts,3e0xpc,SetFoxval,3,Tue Jul 21 02:53:45 2015 UTC,Cross-pollinating will not affect the taste of the fruit. The fruit properties are determined entirely by the parent tree.
marijuanaenthusiasts,3e0xpc,po0rdecision,3,Tue Jul 21 09:36:00 2015 UTC,"Your cherry tree is beautiful. It may fruit, but I don't think it will be for your consumption (won't taste well). But birds may love it.  As for a fruiting tree, yes (for most varieties) you will have to buy them in 2+ of differing varieties (your nursery can recommend types. I have several favorites. Bing is popular and my pollinator favorite is Burlat and Black Tartarian is popular.) And plant them close together.  It all depends where you're at to which variety is available and will thrive best.  A lot of what I've read online says cherries are difficult, but after living my whole life on a cherry orchard, I disagree. Plenty of water in winter and a bit of water before the fruit turns red then SUN SUN SUN. Pruning maybe every 2 to 3 years?"

marijuanaenthusiasts,3e0xpc,po0rdecision,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have several. Birds will be attracted to them over bings because of their stand out color. Out of an orchard of hundreds, the birds love the Rainiers. So once fruit appears, I'd put netting around the tree. They need a pollinator tree as well. They fruit just after Bings but will blossom before. Because of their color bruising is more noticeable but eat away!  Other than the birds, mine are treated just like Bings."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3e0xpc,nickajeglin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:33 2015 UTC,"Beautiful tree. I don't know much about cherries, but this brought back a memory of a neighbor's tree that never fruited. Then one year, it grew a single perfect yellow cherry. That's the only one I ever saw."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3dzt0v,Kodama_todd,18,Mon Jul 20 22:47:41 2015 UTC,"I think that is a Linden. Tilia americana would be my guess but it may be another species.   Trees will send out water sprouts like the branches on the bottom when they are stressed out. Since it is a street tree, it's probably pretty stressed out.   Those branches should be pruned and the cause of the stress should be investigated by an arborist or plant pathologist."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dzt0v,Kodama_todd,5,Mon Jul 20 22:38:25 2015 UTC,"In suburban chicago there are all sorts of new roads from the growth over the last 10-15 years.

marijuanaenthusiasts,3dzt0v,ShittyFieldTech,4,Tue Jul 21 00:39:10 2015 UTC,"Trees never die, they are only killed.   Here's a picture of the same Genus, Tilia, that was broken in half by a tornado 3 yrs ago. The picture was taken this spring. It is suckering and growing water sprouts vigorously trying to get that root/shoot balance back in check.   https://www.flickr.com/gp/30144724@N05/0et5Sf  It's going to be a 25ft bush for a while."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dzt0v,Kodama_todd,2,Tue Jul 21 01:21:36 2015 UTC,"I work at an arboretum in Fargo, ND and I can say from experience that Lindens are the worst at sprouting from the base. Every few weeks we have to go in and prune them so we dont cause damage with the mowers.   Actually, ive never NOT seen a Linden do this, even ones that arent all that stressed."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dzt0v,SilverHoudini,2,Tue Jul 21 03:36:20 2015 UTC,"Really? I haven't noticed that at all. Unless the linden was heavily pruned or stressed. We have 200 or so that don't exhibit that sort of behavior. Most are T. cordata or T. europaeus which may make the difference. They do, however, have a serious sooty mold problem, almost universally. I will have to be in the lookout for the rampant suckering. Maybe the landscape folks are pruning them back before I notice."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dzt0v,Kodama_todd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:12:16 2015 UTC,"The ones I notice suckering are T cordata and T americana. We don't really do anything to them, we've 80+ acres to maintain and the previous steward was somewhat neglectful, so we've been playing catch up for a few years."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3dzt0v,r3dlazer,2,Tue Jul 21 03:37:01 2015 UTC,"Tilia americana typically do this in response to light on their trunk. It does not have to be stress related. In the spring young shoots emerge from the trunk on young and old trees, its good practice to just flick them off when young.  Most shoots originate at the base of the trunk. In nature these trees compensate for their weak limbs by constantly forging ahead with additional stems. One root system can produce dozens of full size trees and keep producing until the roots become diseased.   Only in a city street would you ever find one of these with a single trunk. (Not saying it won't happen in nature, but much more likely to have more than one stem)."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dzt0v,TotoroZoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:04:25 2015 UTC,"It's a Tilia americana (linden, limewood, basswood, etc).  This kind of thing happens, it's suckering up, likely from the roots and/or stem from adventitious growth (less likely), or from stress or damage (more likely).  It doesn't look too bad outwardly, but it is in a shitty, exposed site. It's less than a meter from the curb, the sidewalk and an intersection to boot.  No doubt salted to shit too, being in the GTA.  Also,  who mows the lawn there?"

marijuanaenthusiasts,3dy2fz,Truth_,9,Mon Jul 20 14:58:49 2015 UTC,My front yard  ...which happens to be 14 acres (these are going to take up 5).
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dy2fz,Smithium,4,Mon Jul 20 15:12:10 2015 UTC,Almost makes me want to live in Michigan.  Almost.  This is the biggest lot I've ever lived on in California.
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dy2fz,Smithium,5,Mon Jul 20 20:02:45 2015 UTC,"I suppose my family got a small ""grant"" one time as well.  I think we got a discount up to a certain amount of trees as long as promised not to cut them down for... 10 or 20 years.  It was pretty neat."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dy2fz,TurboShorts,6,Mon Jul 20 15:45:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have to maintain 80% survival rate for 15 years, then I can do whatever I want with the trees.   Edit to add: My program is technically a cost-share program meaning they cover 75% of the cost based on average figures they pre-determined for the area. I could technically make money planting if I were to find deals or freebies but realistically, I figure I'll break even (best case scenario) or have to pay 10% above what they are giving me out of my own pocket. Plus I'll have to cover the replacement cost for trees that put me below 80% survival."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dy2fz,BowserKoopa,4,Mon Jul 20 15:54:15 2015 UTC,"How much time do you think that would take you to do alone?  Does the grant cover any labor cost?  Just curious, I've been thinking along these lines for a while and didn't know there was grant money available for it."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dy2fz,BowserKoopa,3,Mon Jul 20 22:40:03 2015 UTC,"Realistically, it would probably take me 7-10 full days to plant by myself by hand. The conifers would go pretty quick but the deciduous that need tubes are probably going to take 3-5 minutes per tree (3 minutes x 1100 trees is 55 hours). I'm probably going to rent a tree planter and recruit at least one other person to help me which should cut down planting time significantly.  Grant doesn't cover labor and is technically a cost-share so they only cover 75% of the materials cost (based on a pre-determined average and thankfully their ""average"" is high). They also don't cover any equipment I might need to buy or rent (dibble bars or a planting machine for planting, sprayer for weed control, mallet for the stakes, etc.) If I can find places to get cheaper things like zip ties, tree tubes, or stakes, I could theoretically make money off of the deal. But I've been doing the budget and I'll be lucky if I break even. What little money might be left is going to be saved to cover any losses that occur in the first 5 years(I have to maintain 80% survival rate for 15 years, per plan requirements).   And to put it in real numbers, they are giving me $.67 per conifer and $5.40 per hardwood (which includes seedling, tube, stake, and ties). There's also the nerve-racking fact that I need to front the costs and then get reimbursed after they certify the work has been done. I'm probably going to talk to my bank about a loan or upping my credit card limit to cover expenses."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dy2fz,Truth_,3,Tue Jul 21 01:12:47 2015 UTC,That is still an awesome deal though.  A pretty good grant to plant a forest in your yard.

marijuanaenthusiasts,3dy2fz,Truth_,13,Mon Jul 20 14:47:23 2015 UTC,"I'm in Michigan and this is on my own land. The purpose was for EQIP pollinator initiative (I also planted 4 acres of wildflowers and have 28 honeybee hives on my property) and a wildlife conservation cover.  I'm planting so much Norway spruce because that is what the conservationist recommended for me, everything else in the list is native. I've been thinking about talking to him and switching that one out for a native spruce or a mixture of firs, hemlock, and spruce."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3dy2fz,Coduufightinguu365,2,Mon Jul 20 15:43:31 2015 UTC,Yeah but my concern is how slow it grows and the competition it will get from white pine and red oak.
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dy2fz,piceaglauca,3,Mon Jul 20 15:49:18 2015 UTC,"Legit concern. I think a mixture of all those conifers would be great, if not abandoning hemlock all together. But, at least if it does get overgrown by pine and oak, you know it will be able to handle the shading.  edit: just saw your comment about hemlock not being available to order"
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dy2fz,piceaglauca,2,Mon Jul 20 19:02:33 2015 UTC,Spoke with my conservationist and he said it would be fine to swap Norway for White Spruce (but not black because my land wont support those) so I think I'm going to do that instead of planting all those Norways.
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dy2fz,Firebert010,2,Mon Jul 20 19:21:52 2015 UTC,"Can you decide where to put them?  You can give the hemlocks a bit more space from the other species, or put them in their own hemlock stand."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dy2fz,easywormfood,2,Tue Jul 21 17:02:37 2015 UTC,I said hemlock but then I went to look what was available from conservation districts around me. Hemlock is unfortunately not available. But I did speak with my conservationist and he said it would be fine to switch out the Norway for White so I'm going to do that.

A lot of contributing factors ended the industry, such as a total lack of sustainability as well as more stringent environmental regulations. A lot of people will simply blame Clinton and the environmentalists and call it good, meanwhile ignoring the fact that the industry was heavily subsidized by federal money, never too profitable and left us with super fund sites on valuable water front property. Furthermore, our wilderness now drives our main economic engine which, for better or worse, is tourism.  I am, of course, anti clear cutting and very for protecting the remaining old growth stands that are left in the Tongass so I have a pretty heavy bias and you may want to seek a more neutral answer elsewhere."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3dq661,Tuckessee,3,Sat Jul 18 19:01:48 2015 UTC,"Working with trees for years, you no doubt see them through a different lens.  I'm not arguing for a second that culling trees isn't necessary/beneficial. All I'm saying is that a ""let the bodies hit the floor"" tone will play much better with a tree-loving arborist/forestry worker than it will with the average tree-loving member of this sub. It's similar to a paramedic's black humor that would be lost on/somewhat grating to those not in the profession (that's a bit of an extreme analogy, but it'll do for now).  There always seems to be someone commenting negatively when a culling/removal post shows up, and my only goal here was to bring it up for discussion. It's absolutely nothing personal; I wish you well and hope you get laid several times this weekend."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dq661,RespectTheTree,0,Sat Jul 18 19:25:01 2015 UTC,"it is a cool shot, and i appreciate what arborists do greatly. i just thought the idea of the subreddit was to share magnificent examples of trees growing very healthily. i also did not like the pictures of the severely topped trees along roads in Europe posted a while back"
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dq661,hamfoundinanus,-1,Sun Jul 19 03:48:36 2015 UTC,"Anyone who has a problem with pruning and tree removal is a moron, plain and simple. It's a separate issue to logging."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3dq661,BeeSilver9,11,Sat Jul 18 18:35:04 2015 UTC,I'd imagine this subreddit would rather see trees in their full glory not the sad final moments of their existence

marijuanaenthusiasts,3dq661,Burgisio,4,Sat Jul 18 16:18:30 2015 UTC,Both these subs are about trees . why can't I post in both of them ?
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dq661,hamfoundinanus,4,Sat Jul 18 19:48:55 2015 UTC,"You can, but each are for certain interests in trees. There are many subs for any area, they just focus on different areas. /r/marijuanaenthusiasts is more about the beauty of trees. I've actually seen posts here tagged [gore] if there was any tree damage. /r/sfwtrees is more about tree health and working on trees."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dq661,Burgisio,3,Sat Jul 18 21:33:13 2015 UTC,"Because for some reason this subreddit doesn't seem to quite get arboriculture.   Trees come down, they're not always in the best place and can cause damage to peoples houses etc. They need to go sometimes.   (this bit is me ranting rather than to you) I've intentionally ring barked trees before, it creates standing deadwood and is excellent habitat for insects and if its covered in ivy also bats. Eco-system management isn't all about preserving every tree."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dq661,hamfoundinanus,2,Sat Jul 18 20:22:54 2015 UTC,"Because for some reason this subreddit doesn't seem to quite get arboriculture.   I don't think that's the case at all. In a similar vein, deer populations must sometimes be culled for the good of the herd, the environment, and humans. Sometimes, as was the case on Long Island, wildlife specialists with the USDA Wildlife Services are called in to do the culling.  If one of those specialists posted a video of a particularly sweet headshot he landed on a buck he culled, set to Queen's ""Another One Bites the Dust"", how do you think that would be received on a wildlife appreciation subreddit?  https://www.reddit.com/r/marijuanaenthusiasts/comments/3dkp8z/tree_killer_strikes_again/  A tree decapitation video set to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" is in poor taste for a tree appreciation subreddit. It's specious to say that we're clueless as to why sometimes trees need to be culled. Of course we know that forests and especially urban environments need to be managed, just like deer populations do. But I don't think most of us come here for the pink mist."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dq661,Iskandar11,3,Sun Jul 19 05:39:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry I should've said some. Recently I've seen a lot of comments, from where a tree has been felled, with things like 'this shouldn't go in this subreddit we love trees here' it's irked me a bit."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dq661,Rowls,2,Sun Jul 19 09:27:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen people object to what I thought was a perfectly appropriate photo.  A great one I remember was from Australia (I think). It was a relatively wide-ish shot that showed a decent amount of the growth around the trees that were being removed and a man with a chainsaw (?) on the right. I loved seeing the wide shot of a tree and its immediate surrounds in a dense growth area. Yeah, there was a guy with a chainsaw in the pic, but that's what foresters do...this wasn't a clear cutting operation, this was forest maintenance, it's important and necessary.  I thought that pic was respectful and valuable...it wasn't a closeup of metal teeth shredding wood or set to tree killer music. I disagreed with the people complaining about that Australian pic. It was perfect for this sub, imo.  Some people want this to be /r/awwwwwwwwtrees (indica), and some people see it as more /r/chainsawenthusiasts (sativa). I'd like to see it as an indica dominant hybrid."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3drdmt,Ataraxias,9,Sat Jul 18 18:48:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty normal for saplings, especially fruit trees. They want to grow a shitload to try and establish themselves as an actual tree and if they're getting a lot of water they'll put on a lot of growth. The biggest leaves are where the most growth is occurring, and on the new trees there's not many places to channel the growth energy than into the foliage, hence the huge leaves. This is also why established trees with large canopies tend to not exhibit as much growth and often times smaller leaves: there's so many branches and stems to channel the growth to."

""As American as apple pie"", well, edible apples are not American. You can also check List of invasive species in North America on Wikipedia. The most obvious effect was the disappearance of the American chestnut through the chestnut blight. And dutch elm disease killed the elms. And the settlers felled so many redwoods for cheap pulp or toothpicks, even though they were much grander than any European tree. And the one large truly American fruit, Asimina triloba, most people have never had. The explorers were busy chopping trees down and being at war with the natives. On the other hand, at some point national parks were created. If you want to read up on something positive, check that."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3dld4g,tahonte,2,Tue Jul 21 03:40:09 2015 UTC,"When the first Europeans saw the forests, they mostly thought of them as places the Indians hid, things in the way of their expansion. Some places near first contact were already cleared. Verrazzanno, for instance, told how the whole area around  Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island was cleared. The first Virginians told how a man could gallop through the forest at full speed, only the watercourses impeded them.   There were still large forest tracts, but the lands near the villages and towns were cleared and farmed. One French missionary told of riding for 3 days, lost in the corn fields in the 'Arrowhead' of Canada (Ontario between the Great Lakes).   Trees in the Tennessee Valley were part of a belt of 'forest gardens' the Indians had. That is, over many generations, they had cut the trees they didn't want (Tulip Poplar, Maples, etc.) and allowed things like Hickories and White Oaks to grow and multiply. To the Europeans, they were all encumbrances on the land.   I bring that up because many people still think Indians had little to no effect on the land. When the whites got to the Tenn. Valley, most of the Indians had succumbed to disease some 50 years before, so the land was grown up. The trees were usually just felled and burned, many were just girdled and allowed to disintegrate so that sunlight could reach the crops.  So for the most part, most trees were not cut for export, with a very few exceptions. Sassafras was reputed to be a cure-all, and great quantities were exported esp. from VA and NC. By the time of the Am. Revolution, it was all but extinct in VA. Other exceptions were the tall straight pines from Maine, http://www.nelma.org/lagniappe/kings-broad-arrow-and-ewp/ and and the ""knees"" of Tamarack (Larch), both used extensively in ship building. (third paragraph here: https://www.mpbn.net/homestom/mptschap13.html )  Later, in the mid 1700s, people like John Bartram http://www.ushistory.org/tour/bartrams-garden.htm exported great quantities of seed from American trees to Europe. His trees were of interest to people like Linnaeus (who developed the current, most widely used nomenclature system), and royal gardeners across Europe. There is a good book about Bartram, (""The Brother Gardeners"" by Andrea Wulf), which focuses on his gathering / packaging seeds for Europeans.  TL/DR Europeans, with few exceptions, only saw the woods as something to erase."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3dk6l0,DrKyleGreenThumb,2,Fri Jul 17 01:34:06 2015 UTC,You can use many different sizes. Here is a tutorial on how to do it.
marijuanaenthusiasts,3dk6l0,graffiti81,2,Fri Jul 17 01:42:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry, hopefully this helps more: Some plants clone easier than others, so they don't always work (using this method). Basically cut off a healthy looking new growth of a plant, if the stem is too hard it probably won't work, tree cuttings will be harder to clone the harder there bark is, ideally so you don't have a large clone you would choose 6"" or less in length. Place the bottom of the clone in water in your window add root nutrient if you have it, wait a month or a week or two, or until your cutting sprouts new root growth. You can then plant the clone in soil once it has a decent amount of roots.   This is the cheapest way to take a clone for your 'average joe' that doesn't want to spend money purchasing a cloning tray/ aeration system, that say a marijuana grower that depends on a high success rate would do.

Second as a former commercial MMJ grower (albeit Nor Cal and not OR), if you really want a job that pays in bud, you need to work as a trimmer. Most commercial places are legit and will want you to have medical card. Some places will ask and not check. In either case, if you are living in your tent, try not to look homeless or be too much of the dumb hippy-bum stereotype. All of us who are/were commercial growers went through that phase at 19 too and now we have shaved heads and drive pickups to blend in with local red necks, so if you look a little more put together it will increase chances of landing a gig. Also know where to look. I don't know any growers in portland but I'm sure there are some. Try the outskirts. I do know of some in Cedar Grove (south of eugene) but thats probably too far.  Lastly, almost no grower is gonna let you crash on his land for just trim labor. You will likely need to offer to be farm hand type labor 'bitch' as well for awhile if you want free camping and free bud. If you impress and work hard usually some actual cash pay will follow."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3d703u,T-Minus9,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:58:40 2015 UTC,"They can, but that is the cambium/phloem that is red like that in this particular photo.  It is nearly impossible to have a stem tear out as this one has, and expose heartwood.  About the only way to have a stem expose heartwood vertically is if the stem barberchairs, which this one hasn't.  The heartwood is quite deep into a tree, and is only formed after many years, heartwood is often only the inner 1/3 to 2/3 of the diameter of the stem."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3d703u,billy-bumbler,2,Tue Jul 14 13:14:41 2015 UTC,my mistake.  this is definitively cambium
marijuanaenthusiasts,3d703u,T-Minus9,5,Tue Jul 14 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are saying it's heartwood.  It isn't.  This is the bright cambium, characteristic of many fruit trees (apple, pear, cherry, etc).  This is normal for cherries, but usually earlier in the season, when the growth is fastest and the water most prevalent in the tree.  It tore out like that because there is a slight buffer zone of cells between the cambium and the forming xylem and phloem on either side.  The cambium cells grow and develop, differentiating and forming phloem on the outside, which later becomes the bark, and xylem on the inside inside, which later becomes the actual ""wood"" of the tree, and much later becomes the heartwood.  As these cells are in their early stage, they have not fully formed, and are not properly bonded (for lack of a better term) and act almost like a grease between the existing wood and the cambium.  In the early spring you can grab a branch with your hand and twist off the outer bark of a tree along the cambium.  In this case, when the limb failed, the cells adjacent the cambium were weaker than those of the existing phloem, and created the ""tear out"" along that long strip of outer wood.  Edit: Clarity, such as: ""with you had grab?""  what the hell was that supposed to mean?  TL:DR   This colour is totally normal, and characteristic of cambium tissue of many fruit trees."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3d703u,Mr_Impulse,3,Tue Jul 14 15:11:52 2015 UTC,Great reply! You can see by the depth of the coloring that it is clearly just under the bark surface. Thanks for sharing.
marijuanaenthusiasts,3d703u,T-Minus9,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"Really sorry to hear that.   Were  both those branches in full leaf?  Is the wood in the large broken limb spongy at all, or crumbly?  Showing white ""striations"" or stringy tissue?   What about the interior heartwood?  Is it crumbly? Does it look like it's broken into cubes?   Trees can stay in full leaf and look great, but be rotten or have fungal infections, showing no outward symptoms.   I have seen it a lot with crabapple, and cherry isn't much different."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3d703u,T-Minus9,3,Tue Jul 14 05:45:41 2015 UTC,"No.  Not it in this case.  That red wood like that is the cambium.  The heartwood is often a dark red in cherries, but this picture is not showing the heartwood.  The whitish part is the outer sapwood, you are correct, but the red is the living undifferentiated cambium underneath.  Below that would be more sapwood, then quite deep (probably not at all in this small cross-section) would be the heartwood."

In my experience many varieties have a harder time keeping a nice green needle in Northern climates.   I live in South Dakota US and we often have very frigid and dry conditions over winter and I find white pines like this every spring/summer as the temps warm up. Salts could be a factor.

The sweet bay magnolia favors wetter conditions and it's only semi evergreen, with light green leaves with light underside. Those are the two most prevalent southern magnolias everyone thinks of, but there are a few deciduous species found more in the upland south and higher elevations in the deep south. OP's tree is one of those. One species has the largest non compound leaf of any tree in the continent, and in the fall looks like someone scattered newspapers on the forest floor"

The Quaking Aspen tree pictured was planted 7 years ago, store bought. Had been growing fine. Until just a week ago the top of the tree, about halfway up the trunk to the top, turned brown and now it looks like it's dying.   My mom thinks it was struck by lightning. My stepdad thinks it was bent by a storm and now its dead from the bend spot up. I think it may have some sort of disease. What is certain, is none of us have any clue as to what it could be. We also live in NE Kansas.  Thanks for the help."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3cutqu,AcerRubrum,2,Fri Jul 10 23:27:22 2015 UTC,"Looks like its in good shape below the dead trunk. carefully prune the dead stuff off, you're not getting it back. Watch what sprouts next year and make sure you get a single stem growing out of the top of the pruned trunk so it can resume its upward growth. Aspens are finicky and in nature rely on producing many stems from their rootstock to make up for the fact that they just up and die back some times. Could have been from numerous reasons, heat stress, too much water, physical injury, etc. whats important is it doesn't look like a systemic problem, so prune out the dead stuff and take a wait-and-see approach with some structural pruning going forward."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3coali,Seicair,12,Thu Jul 9 22:35:09 2015 UTC,The correlation could be explained differently. Perhaps healthier people are more likely to choose to live in an area with more trees. People who like nature and trees are more likely to be outdoorsy and therefore healthier and are also more likely to choose to live in an area with more trees.  I find it difficult to believe that living near trees can improve physical health. Air movement will quickly spread out any air improving benefits from the trees.
marijuanaenthusiasts,3coali,peter-bone,4,Thu Jul 9 15:03:35 2015 UTC,"It's not all physical though, while the tree might not physically improve the air it can definitely improve moods and promote calm, and being happy and calm is much healthier than grumpy and stressed.  That said trees do definitely have an effect on the air. I feel a clear difference biking down the tree filled ""bike highway"" and a normal street in my city, but admittedly the abscence of cars plays a big part there too."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3coali,Priff,2,Thu Jul 9 16:08:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's why I said physical health. I agree that it could improve mental health.  I think it's only the absence of cars that make the air cleaner and possible a placibo effect of seeing trees that makes you think it's cleaner."

The street stays cooler much later in the day than in other neighborhoods. In my last neighborhood the sun would make it unbearably hot by 8am and I dreaded going for walks or runs.

If so, you want to make sure to rinse those very thoroughly before eating them, and try to pick the ones farther back from the trail.    I envy you, OP!   All the usual wild berries near me have either been scavenged out or didn't produce much to begin with this year because of the heat."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3cgpvu,whatisithatisit,4,Tue Jul 7 20:10:37 2015 UTC,one of my favorite trees as well. there are a few different species of catalpa but i can never tell which is which.
marijuanaenthusiasts,3cgpvu,AcerRubrum,9,Tue Jul 7 20:34:49 2015 UTC,"outside of the southeastern and lower midwestern US it's almost always Catalpa speciosa, the hardier Northern variety. The other common species, C. bignonioides or Southern Catalpa only does well in warmer climates and usually has 3 points to at least some of its leaves, and it's also bred into a n ornamental lollipop-shaped variety, C. bignonioides var. nana, which is fugly as all hell IMO but its cheap and youll find em planted along walkways and sidewalks everywhere."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3cgpvu,T-Minus9,13,Tue Jul 7 22:21:11 2015 UTC,"Northern Catalpa.  Catalpa speciosa  It is ""native"" to southern Ontario (golden horseshoe) which is the  northern effect of its range. It's hardy enough to tolerate as far north as Ottawa, but it's not native that far south.   Beautiful trees.   Fun fact: when the tree is in bloom is the timing window to spray active insecticide for soft and hard scale insects."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3cgpvu,pfunkmort,12,Tue Jul 7 22:20:59 2015 UTC,...but...but...the bees.
marijuanaenthusiasts,3cgpvu,T-Minus9,12,Tue Jul 7 22:47:39 2015 UTC,"No no no!  Sorry, I didn't mean ""active"" to mean non-selective or systemic pesticides.  ""Active"" refers to the scale insects themselves.  They are stationary under their scale armor 90% of the year, feeding on the tree/shrub and protected by a hard or soft scale.  The only exception is during the active or crawler stage (during the catalpa bloom period).  During this period, they emerge from under their scales, mate, lay eggs and run to a new spot to set up shop and produce a new scale for protection.  This if the time an insecticidal soap application can be applied to your magnolias,  euonymous, sand cherries, or whatever else has scale insects.  Soap (40:1 dishsoap to water) will be sufficient to kill scale insect crawlers and combined with a dormant treatment in spring and fall (follow the label), patience (about 2-4 years to be totally free) and diligence, you're in the clear."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3cgpvu,pfunkmort,5,Wed Jul 8 01:03:33 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. Bees only really interact with plants when they're blooming. Take agriculture for example - commercially, behind the scenes, there are beekeepers going around from crop to crop, from field to field, with their bees to pollinate and increase yields. Farmers pay good money for it and everyone's happy.   If you were a beekeeper (as I am), you might privately classify crops into ""dirty"" crops and ""clean"" crops. That doesn't mean that...apples, which might be considered cleaner than cranberries are sprayed less cranberries. It means that cranberries have a rolling budding period and so farmers spray (for the fruit) while they have bees pollinating (for the flowers) and both are going on at the same time. It's a similar issue with almonds, and some other crops. Those pesticides get into the nectar and have a much larger impact on the bees than say, apples, which might be sprayed during the fruiting period, but not the flowering period. That's my point.  Spraying anything while it's flowering is going to be much more likely to affect bees (or any natural pollinators)."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3cgpvu,T-Minus9,10,Wed Jul 8 01:45:37 2015 UTC,"OK, hold on, please.  No more fun facts from me.  Seriously though, hard and soft scale insects are not a pest of Catalpas.  They are pest of magnolias, euonymous, cherries, etc.  You would spray those species while the catalpas are in bloom.  I would never condone spraying a tree/plant while it is in bloom.  The species being sprayed having all already bloomed weeks to months ago.  Edit: clarity"

marijuanaenthusiasts,3ciq5v,Eliarch,3,Wed Jul 8 05:43:30 2015 UTC,"There's no good way to bring that back under control.  But that is not a bad thing.  I was expecting to see a standard height trunk and a bunch of long limbs in the canopy as of it were a fruit tree that got away, but that tree had never been pruned for fruit production.  That is how pears grow naturally.  So you couldn't easily pollard the tree to bring it back to 2m height as there isn't a knuckle or a standard fruit tree shape to prune back to.  Any work to reduce it will likely injure or kill the tree. And it will look like a gnarly mess and take years to recover and bear fruit properly.   The existing tree should be cleaned up (dead and hazardous limbs) and left as the beautiful specimen it is.  Where it if located, it will be a beautiful addition to your back yard.  No doubt the flowers are spectacular, and tree local wildlife will really appreciate the fruit.  You can always harvest the fruit you can reach, but if you're serious about getting a full yield, you can plant a new pear tree and keep it well pruned from the get-go. Depending on Sun exposure, a new pear tree will bear fruit in 2-4 years.  Just my thoughts on this tree."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3ciq5v,T-Minus9,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:27:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your advice. I had figured that was what I would hear but thought I would pose the question anyway.   This is the very back corner of my lot, and right next to the side of my home on the east side of the house.  My home is on a south/west facing slope so this corner gets plenty of sunlight where the other trees on the lot do not block it.   My wife is a pear fanatic so I had hoped to make this one more suitable for picking.  About 20 feet upslope is a second (and third) pear that are much smaller. http://imgur.com/WBhuWCu  One is bearing the other is not, straight back = bearing, sapling in the waterfall = not.  I have no idea what variety they are yet but this one looks like a better contender for managing.  It seems the top of it has died at some point so I don't feel too bad about cutting it back.  That being said I really cant afford to loose these trees as they seem to be doing an excellent job keeping that area from eroding.  Is this one too far gone to retame in your opinion?"
marijuanaenthusiasts,3ciq5v,vtslim,2,Wed Jul 8 16:42:01 2015 UTC,"If you take that central leader off, make sure you have a nice sharply angled cut so that water doesn't sit on cut-end.    Just follow the 1/3 rule (at the most, maybe 1/4 is better), and leave living lower branches alone if you're going to go after a big chunk of the top.  Try to train re-growth, and be on top of those water-sprouts like white on rice.  In a couple years you can start to remove big ugly lower limbs and favor the young productive ones (and train them to good angles)"

It's what we always ask for in this sub... although it is missing a full tree shot picture, which is usually the only one we get!  Sumacs are shrubs and would never grow that thick of a trunk.  The leaves do look similar, though!  I'm only familiar with shagbark hickory, but after Googling normal hickory the leaves are very similar.  Green ash was my initial guess.  Will have to do some Google investigation to confirm...  Edit: No luck on a final answer yet, however, I found this awesome website for Ohio  Edit#2: Aha!  I foolishly looked over a simple defining feature between hickory and ash: opposite versus alternate leaves.  Hickories have alternate leaves and ash opposite.  The first photo in the album looks alternate, suggesting hickory.  Due to its simple bark, that would point to bitternut hickory.  If you saw any sort of fruit/nut forming, that'd make the identification pretty obvious.  I don't see any in the picture.  They would be small, if present.  I am ready to be proven wrong, however!"

marijuanaenthusiasts,3ce1tv,kslusherplantman,6,Tue Jul 7 04:41:04 2015 UTC,"Without doing a core sample can't be sure how old the tree is. Elms grow very quickly and can caliper up very quickly also. I've seen elms under 30 with this size diameter trunk. Hell, I've seen live oaks in containers with larger diameters, and they definitely are not 200+ And aren't even 50 years old...  On that note do you know what type of elm? Most elms we have now in horticulture/landscaping are resistant to Dutch elm disease.  Beyond that: fertilize in spring and fall, interior thinning, proper tree trimming, and watch for aphids. But aphids won't kill a tree like that, just make it ugly."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3ce1tv,DoxBox,3,Tue Jul 7 05:29:29 2015 UTC,Our home was built around 1900-1920. Our property was actually the home of an orchard at one time. It seemed strange to just have a random 200 year old tree. I know it's subjective to tell the age of a tree without checking the growth rings. I just used the growth calculator to ball park the age but apparently my ballpark is off.   I wish I knew which elm variety it is but it's the last one of my street that hasn't rotted and ended up as mulch...or cellulose
marijuanaenthusiasts,3ce1tv,akiva23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:32:19 2015 UTC,"No, it could be that old, just not so likely considering our native elm populations were decimated by Dutch elm diseased. When I was landscaping in central Texas, we would deal with heritage live oaks that were hundreds of years old. Elms just grow to quickly for that measure to work. Especially since those calculations are meant for trees in the wild, not cultivated. Cultivated trees grow much more quickly because humans tend to water and fertilize them regularly, not forcing them to get it on their own.  If you can load a pic of leaves, leaves attached to branches, and a close up on that trunk we can probably get you closer than ""it's an elm"""

marijuanaenthusiasts,3cc9w1,TPrimeTommy,4,Mon Jul 6 20:06:12 2015 UTC,"My advice:  Find a good arborist. Not just some company with a fleet of big trucks, but a local individual with a good reputation. They will be able to clean up the split limb in the most effective way. From the looks of it, this will probably not save the tree, but it will buy you several years. Especially if you take care of it in its dormant season like /u/LadyHeather suggested.  In the coming years take four or five scion cuttings every winter/spring and graft them onto a host that you plant ASAP (assuming you don't already have something that will host the cuttings). Apples graft fairly easily as long as you take nice healthy cuttings and make good clean cuts.  If you give it attention, this apple will survive and this will just be another great story in its long history."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3cc9w1,SweaterFish,3,Tue Jul 7 03:54:02 2015 UTC,"That limb is not. That section of the tree will die all the way down, leaving an open wound, and open to more problems. The best time to trim any fruit tree is when it is dormant. You can either cut it off and then detail trim in the ""winter"" yourself, or hire a tree company to do it. However, it will not look the same ever again. Will it survive?- probably, but with an open gash that might cause problems later. If you keep it instead of plant a new one (which is always a good idea anyways) trim the tree this up coming winter to ""lighten the load"" and consider in the spring pinching blossoms back so it has time to recover and reduce its load next year."

You want fresh green ones that you are able to leave an indent when you press on it with your finger. Make sure there are no bugs in them too. I use a knife to go around the nut and twist off the green hull then scratch off as much of the leftover hull bits as you can. They have to dry for a while. Then I have a big nut cracker that I open them with. You could use a hammer to smash it open then a nut pick to get the tiny pieces

You may treat a small infestation by spraying with water, and this is good to do a couple times a week as a prevention.

In rocky crags in Japan etc.   Only after they were seen and collected in nature did the practice of growing them by restricting their root growth and access to nutrients.  So the OP is correct.

The water does not ""puddle around the rocks""; in fact, all you're doing is raising the level of the perched water table.   /u/AndrewFlash, this is the wrong time of the year to be doing any kind of root work. Go ahead and pot up to a larger size, but don't touch the roots. Make sure your new container has drainage holes, and make sure to use a potting mix, not soil.  Also, snow is a fantastic insulator. Allow the entire container to be buried under snow."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3c3xsr,Notdrugs,2,Sun Jul 5 13:23:58 2015 UTC,"In adittion to this, adding rocks to a pot makes future transplanting more dangerous for the plant, as the roots can be destroyed in transit between pots."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3c3xsr,offramppinup,2,Sun Jul 5 17:32:20 2015 UTC,"When you repot it, make sure the root flare (where the soil line hits, basically the division of above ground and below ground parts of the plant) isn't buried or exposed. Also your soil will settle a bit after a few waterings so check if the pot needs more soil after a couple weeks, it probably will."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3c3xsr,wolf2600,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"Don't worry so much.  Plants are extremely resilient.    Just put it in some all-purpose potting soil, keep it watered (and drained), and ensure it gets plenty of light.  Plants don't need constant attention, water it once every week or so, and just let it grow.  You're more likely to harm if from over-attention than from under-attention.  If ever in doubt, just let it be."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3c3xsr,tank5,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:18:06 2015 UTC,"A grown tree is not made of the dirt it grew in. There are some nutrients that come from the soil, yeah, but most of the tree is made from molecules like cellulose, which is carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The tree manufactures those molecules from water pulled up through the roots and carbon dioxide and oxygen from the air, using sunlight as the energy to run the process.  I say this because your post makes it sound like you think the dirt has to be replaced for the tree to keep going, which is not the case. The size of the pot will limit how big the tree will grow, but you don't have to take the old dirt out. Most pots have sloped walls so that it's possible to un-pot the whole thing as root ball holding all the dirt. You then just put that big mass of root and dirt into another pot or into the ground.  If your tree is inside, it probably needs more direct sunlight than more dirt. If there are fully grown wild trees of the same species around, it shows that it's perfectly capable of surviving the winter in the ground. They started as baby trees too."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3c1i92,rv-oz,3,Sat Jul 4 01:50:55 2015 UTC,"Forest biologist here, this does not look like caterpillar damage or poop to me. Take the other comments indicating they are as such with a grain of salt.  In my opinion, this is definitely a fungal or bacterial problem. As some have indicated, pear rust seems the most likely culprit, but you could also be dealing with leaf spot or pear scab (though with the former, the spots would likely be more necrotic and with the latter, you may notice scab on fruit, twigs, etc as opposed to just the leaves). So I think the best guess from this one picture is pear rust.  One huge clue for this being pear rust would be the presence of any juniper trees/shrubs in the immediate area. All rusts require a secondary host (juniper) in order to complete their life cycle.  The best, and many times only, way to determine what is causing problems with your tree is to take/send a sample to your local university Ag Extension (usually the state/agriculture/science university in your state), who will usually be able to find out what specific pathogen (or other pest) is causing symptoms (or signs, in the case of rust spots) to be expressed.  I would be cautious doing any treatment until you know 100% what the problem is. Treating for one thing but having it be another may lead to more problems for your tree and you."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3bxzss,jwinterm,3,Fri Jul 3 02:18:01 2015 UTC,"Looks like it might be transplant shock. Vitamin b1 product from the nursery or any transplant shock product might help, but I would avoid fertilizers right now as they might burn. In general I avoid doing too much of any planting this time of year (also in cali), the heat is just too much and seems to increase the risk of shock-- most things don't thrive, if they even survive.   Also, I would mulch up to more like a few inches from the base of the trunk. Tree people correct me if I'm wrong, but with that distance i don't think you're getting much benefit from the mulch. :)   As to watering I'd put the hose on the lowest drip you can negotiate, just a tiny tiny trickle, and leave that on all night for a few days. That will encourage deep root growth.  Last thing - one last ditch effort I sometimes do with our trees and plants if the above doesn't help is to put up some shade cloth  or even an umbrella for a few days during peak heat to help it recover a bit. Things really need to acclimate to our heat, and sometimes I've found that a few days to recover, then limit exposure to a few hours a day and slowly increase over a week will help. Your friends and family might question your sanity for it, but the tree might appreciate it :)"

marijuanaenthusiasts,3bxzss,thelurkess,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:27:48 2015 UTC,"Ugh, yes I'm thankful for the heat break for sure! On the roots I think if you consider that the roots probably aren't much wider than the pot it originally came in a few weeks ago, the mulch isn't doing much to protect them from heat and drying out the soil at that depth. Definitely if you have a mature tree you want to give it more space, and you definitely don't want mulch touching the trunk, but personally I'd guess that 2 inches or so is probably more effective at this stage :) good luck!"

You basically want a smaller stick that's newer growth (with greenish bark, not brown) about 18 inches long. Cut extra branches off. I've done late-season willow cuttings before and not had any problems. They're generally pretty tough trees.  You can try a bit of rooting hormone too, but generally my willows haven't needed it. You can definitely container grow the willows for some time if you like. Just keep them watered.

marijuanaenthusiasts,3bvlpb,Alfredruth,2,Thu Jul 2 14:50:40 2015 UTC,"I can't make a positive diagnosis but when I planted weeping willow cuttings I did it way differently.  Firstly, I harvested my cuttings before they leafed out in early Spring. This ensures the energy is embodied in the branches rather than the leaves. I cut the end terninal off as well to encourage spreading growth rather than height. Then I just stuck them into a wet spot in the new yard. Presto done-zo. They're quite happy.  I think the fix here would be to take whip cuttings, a single branch stuck into the ground, rather than a series of branches, and cut the end terminals to discourage the lead terminal bud hormone that inhibits follower buds.   I would be unsurprised if the mother tree, left to her own devices, made a kickass recovery and kept growing despite being uprooted. I see it all the time. That said, might not be such a good idea for the backyard. Could be cool. Might be hard on the resale value. Lols.  By yeah. I think smaller cuttings would perform better.

marijuanaenthusiasts,3bogrd,ilexmucronata,15,Tue Jun 30 23:10:00 2015 UTC,How do people like you know these things?   Aren't there like a million different plant species?  It's massively impressive.
marijuanaenthusiasts,3bogrd,TED_666,34,Wed Jul 1 01:47:29 2015 UTC,"Check /r/whatsthisplant for more.  In general, every plant has a distinctive appearance. Leaf shape and structure, seeds, fruit, trunk, all these things are recognizable once you start paying attention.  Once you start to get to know plants, it's similar to recognizing human faces. Say you know fifty people. You know instantly, without thinking about it, whether a given person is your mom or your friend Charles Mondiguez. If somebody from a planet where everyone looks alike were to ask you, how do you recognize all these people? you likely wouldn't come up with a quick answer. Is it the nose? The eyes? The mouth? It's a combination of things you just recognize. Likewise, you can tell almost instantly if somebody is from East Asia, South Asia, Africa, Southern Europe, Northern Europe, Native America, and so on.  For me, recognizing plants is like that. I started learning about plants around 2009 out of personal interest - it has nothing to do with anything I've ever studied - and now I can walk around my neighborhood and point things out and say, ""Oh, that's definitely an oak; that's Norfolk Island Pine; that shrub right there is going to produce soapberries.""  Even though there are millions of species of plants, they are all very distinctive and easy to tell apart once you know what to look for.  Sometimes you'll have closely related species which are harder to tell apart, but even then, you'll know what genus and family it's in. Oaks are like that. There are about six hundred species of oaks native to Asia and North America (including Europe); some are distinctive, some look really similar to one another, but you always know it's an oak because oaks usually have distinctive leaves and produce acorns. There are 2,000 species of palm trees, many of which are present in South Florida (native and exotic), but they are very easy to tell apart based on height, leaf shape, trunk texture and shape, fruit, and so on. Some palms have very distinctive features which makes it obvious, such as queen palm or Madagascar triangle palm. Sometimes closely related trees will have distinct features which make them easy to tell apart, sometimes they don't. But if I can't tell exactly what some tree is, I'll always at least know which family it's in.  If you'd like to learn more about plants, do this. (If you have a camera.) Spend time walking around in your neighborhood, and pay attention to the plants, all of them. The trees, the shrubs, the grasses, the vines, the so-called weeds, the pioneers growing from cracks in the sidewalk, the lawn-borne wildflowers in danger of being mowed, and so on. Notice the leaf shape and color, and try to look for distinct features such as flowers, fruit, tendrils, thorns, or trunk texture.  If you see something that catches your eye, take a picture and post it to r/whatsthisplant. They will likely know what it is. Once you find out, look it up on Wikipedia. Read about it, and try to catch the following details: Where is it native to, what is it used for, is it edible, what are its ecological roles in its native habitat, how long does it live. Also see if there are any interesting details. Prickly pear cactus, for example, has a funny story about when they introduced it to Australia.  For every species page on Wikipedia, there is a ""sidebar"" on the upper right side, usually underneath the photograph, where it spells out the kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species, usually with clickable links. Once you finish reading about the species, click on the genus and read just a tiny bit about it - you're not trying to become an expert, just satisfying an idle curiosity - find out the other members of the genus, see if there's only two or three or if there are hundreds, see if there are any plants in the genus which are familiar to you, such as mangoes or broccoli. Then look at the family. After a few months of doing this, you'll notice there aren't that many families, and you'll start to get to know them. They all end in ""-aceae."" Solanaceae. Fagaceae. Cannabaceae. Poaceae. I personally pronounce it ""ay-see-ay,"" but I could be totally wrong. Who cares. I like that pronunciation. Then finally check the order - there really are just a few, only about a dozen in each major group.  The top two levels of plants will become familiar to you quickly. (I'm going to skip to the top level and then go back down to the middle; at these levels, plant classification doesn't really use ""phylum"" and ""class"" and all that.) At the highest level, there are four main types of land plants, which are very easy to identify at a glance. They are angiosperms, gymnosperms, mosses, and ferns. (There are actually three more types of photosynthesizing organisms, for a total of seven; the other ones are aquatic and marine species that include seaweed, algae, and worts, but those aren't worth getting into unless you're really interested. Shit starts to get weird there; for example, not all seaweeds are universally considered to be plants. By the way, I know all of this from reading Wikipedia.)  If you're still reading this, I will now give a brief description of each major category of plants, in the order of when they evolved.  First, the weird stuff I just mentioned - the aquatic and marine plants, seaweeds, the worts: hornworts and liverworts, which evolved in water. (Edit: I don't know anything about the wort plants; apparently some do grow on land and they did evolve more recently.) There are also lichens, which are not mosses, and are really weird organisms in that they are a symbiosis of plant cells and fungal cells. Fungi, by the way, are more closely related to animals than they are to plants.  Next there are the mosses, which are the first land plants. They came out of the ocean ""shortly"" after the Cambrian explosion. (Edit: Maybe they didn't.) Like the weird groups, they are non-vascular, which means they don't have strong or rigid bodies and cannot perform certain functions such as transferring water from one part of their bodies to another. This is why mosses tend to be short, small, and close to the ground. For millions and millions of years, mosses were the only land plants; they grew in and around bare rock, opening the way for the next phases of plants.  After mosses is ferns. Like mosses, ferns reproduce with spores and not seeds. Ferns, however, do possess vascular tissue and can grow to great heights. You can always know a plant is a fern if you look underneath the leaf and see these dots. Those are the spores. There are other types of ferns like equisetum that look like tall grasses. Back in ancient times, there were massive giant ferns which grew as big as tall trees do today, but without wood.  The next two types of plants that evolved are the seed plants. First, the gymnosperms. There are four main types of gymnosperms, but the thing they have in common is (for the most part) they produce pine cones. Their name means something like ""exposed seed,"" because their seeds are directly exposed to the outside world. Pine trees and conifers represent one of the four main types of gymnosperms. The other three are ginkgos (a once brilliantly diverse group which today has only one living species, the biloba; this tree is considered a living fossil), cycads (they look similar to palm trees but are not related), and a really weird type of plant from the Namibian desert called Welwetschia with specimens that can live for over 2,000 years.  The last group, the most recent to evolve and the most diverse, is the angiosperms. Their name means ""seed inside"" or something like that. Angiosperms are distinct because they produce fruit and flowers. If you see a plant and it has a fruit or a flower, it is an angiosperm. The vast majority of plant foods you eat - except pine nuts and seaweed, I guess - come from angiosperms. They are distinct from gymnosperms because their seeds come packed inside of a fruit.  Compared to the other plants, which had established themselves even before the first reptiles split from amphibians (edit: or shortly after), angiosperms evolved extremely recently - about 65 million years ago, around the same time as when the dinosaurs died out and mammals and birds began taking over. Curiously, bees first showed up at around the same time, too.  If you start learning more about your local plants, chances are that the vast majority of what you'll find will be angiosperms or gymnosperms. You'll know which is which (but you won't know which is which you'll just strut what the fuck) because gymnosperms have pinecones and angiosperms have flowers. You can learn about the categories of gymnosperms in a day from Wikipedia.  In Angiosperms, there are a few main categories, and you will notice the same ones over and over as you go on. Rosids. Magnolids. Asterids. Eudicots. That's about it. Almost everything you find will belong to one of those. The more plants you look up, the more you'll be able to place them as belonging to one of these major groups.  That's pretty much it. I'm not sure if all of that was coherent, or if it was clear, or why I typed all that out in response to your comment, and I can't guarantee you that it's all correct, but there it is: A brief tour of the plant kingdom. If I were to conclude this, I'd say plant a vegetable garden at home, along with fruit trees and native trees; pay attention to the wildlife that uses your local plants, including insects, or which types of trees the birds make nests in; and never jump to the conclusion that a plant you don't recognize is a ""weed;"" it is likely a pioneer helping to clean up the ravaged soils and restore nitrogen, and it's likely providing pollen and nectar for your local bees and butterflies. Get rid of your lawn, if you have one."

And all I learned was just fitting for my geological area. But you learn too look at plants, you kinda get to understand how things are named, what families plants fall in, how certain characteristics are named. Stuff like that. Now it has been ten years since I did that study, but I still have a love for plants of course. And you're right, there are millions, nobody knows everything and you kinda have to specialize.

Roughly 75% of the trees were infested with White Ant. There were two near misses in about 3 months this year, where young kids were almost seriously injured.

No guarantee that this will kill it, might just rot out the middle and leave the living parts. Might increase the chance it will fall in a storm. Also remember that fungi have important ecosystem function and are not to always be feared.

marijuanaenthusiasts,3bjhzu,amichaux,3,Mon Jun 29 21:52:08 2015 UTC,"If you feel like fertilizing it, wait until next year to apply a time-release type. At this point the tree is trying to survive and won't be able to uptake much fertilizer given the loss of roots.  An application of diluted liquid fertilizer might be slightly beneficial. The liquid type is easier for a plant to take up as it's already suspended in water. If so, apply it where you know the hole was dug."

If you rolled, you would most likely roll in place rather than roll out of the hammock. Also, humans have thousands upon millions of years sleeping on tree limbs, its almost a primal instinct to stay centered.

marijuanaenthusiasts,3bdjoa,junkpile1,2,Sun Jun 28 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"Tree climbing is actually a great recreational activity.  step one, take a small string called a ""throw line"" and use a ~12 oz bean bag called a ""throw weight"" and throw it over the branch union ( Y ) that's as high as you can get while still being larger than your wrist.  step two take the throw line and pull up the throw weight on the other side to ""isolate"" the branch you have thrown over, if needed.  step three tie the throw line onto the rope using a clove hitch followed by half hitches, pull the rope into the tree  step four access the tree by climbing the rope, there are many mechanical devices as well as hitches (a type of knot that stays in place when loaded and moves when unloaded) so it becomes personal preference. basically a foot ascender can be used so you stand up little by little and slowly get higher, while you move your hitch upwards. the hitch secures you and the ropes used are incredibly strong.   step five once you get into the canopy tree climbing is orders of magnitude easier than rock climbing. As a very very poor clumsy rock climber, I can get to the spots needed to do professional tree work with relative ease, where as while rock climbing I might come to a section that I physically don't have the balance or strength or dyno ability to ascend.

marijuanaenthusiasts,3b8y7j,ExoticStrains,3,Fri Jun 26 23:33:40 2015 UTC,"Ailanthus altissima:       Ailanthus altissima /eɪˈlænθəs ælˈtɪsɨmə/,  commonly known as tree of heaven, ailanthus, or in Standard Chinese as chouchun (Chinese: 臭椿; pinyin: chòuchūn; literally: ""foul smelling tree""), is a deciduous tree in the Simaroubaceae family. It is native to both northeast and central China, as well as Taiwan. Unlike other members of the genus Ailanthus, it is found in temperate climates rather than the tropics. The tree grows rapidly and is capable of reaching heights of 15 metres (49 ft) in 25 years. However, the species is also short lived and rarely lives more than 50 years, though its remarkable suckering ability makes it possible for this tree to clone itself indefinitely and live considerably longer   (since they are linked to the mother tree and thus partly fed by it, the suckers are less vulnerable than the seedlings and can grow faster).

marijuanaenthusiasts,3b21fk,greenmntnboy410,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:18:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah dude, I worked in landscaping for 10 years and I've been an arborist for 4. Have I seen trees around a city? Yes, as part of my associates degree in Arboriculture and Landscape Management, I worked for the city of Burlington, Vt planting and maintaining the cities tree population.  Saying the ""tree is screwed"" might have been a bit dramatic but the reality is that the situation that tree is in is less than ideal. Water and nutrient absorbing roots are typically 1 to 1.5 times the radius of the crown, so in this case, a majority of those roots are underneath asphalt/concrete which doesn't tend to allow for much water absorption. Soil compaction (again a result of the asphalt/concrete) further hinders the roots ability to absorb water, nutrients, and oxygen.  Are trees growing in the city totally screwed? Probably not, but their growing conditions are certainly less than ideal."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3ay04v,Antimony04,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:30:52 2015 UTC,"OP. I'll try an analogy. Your tree roots is like the stomach of the tree. Taking in and processing and providing nutrients. You gave it a stomach shrinking surgery. In people, you will lose your fat storage. In trees you will lose any storage areas the tree has reserved, ie large branchs. It is hard to say the severity, but the tree is trying to correct itself and adapt to survive on its new stomach.   It may or may not make it, you should see within 3-5 years how bad it will be. If the tree is within reach of a house or playground, keep a very sharp eye on it. Especially, especially if you live in a windy area.  Edit: You can remove dead branches. Depending on the tree you may want to seal the cut wound. Also keep in mind insects and diseases feed on injured trees first. They know your tree is hurt. It may not be the root cuts that kill the tree but it may put it in stress enough where insects come in and finish the job."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3ave7z,squidboots,3,Fri Jul 3 21:39:31 2015 UTC,Primary problem is sun scorch. Move it to indirect light and then slowly transition it to direct light when the leaves have recovered.  Secondary problem is overwatering.

marijuanaenthusiasts,3ave7z,chadul,4,Tue Jun 23 20:38:01 2015 UTC,"You are overwatering it by a large margin. You should only water it when the soil is completely dry, which should happen 1-4 times a month. This plant grows in the hot, dry savannahs of sub-Saharan Africa, so it needs to be in full sun. Also, don't replant it as it's too late in the season for that. It's deciduous, only maintaining its leaves for about 3 months a year, so if you replant it now it may prematurely drop its leaves and never recover. You could replant it next year in early spring, but probably not before then. Chances are that it won't fully recover from the damage you caused this year, but it might recover in Spring of next year. Also, keep an eye out for the weather forecast in case it's supposed to drop below 10 degrees Celsius (50F). My baobab tree died on me when the temperature dropped overnight near the freezing point. I almost cried.   Baobab trees are very rare, so you have to do a lot of research just to get some growing advice. Also, they're extremely difficult to keep alive, so you have to do your homework. What kills most people's baobab trees is what's killing yours right now: rot. Make sure that you don't over water it, and that the soil drains very well. Goodluck."

Treat it once after spring rain, then treat it again 2 weeks later. It's cheap, but you'll have to buy a back pack sprayer for like 40 bucks too. They're handy to have around though. I've never actually experience any problems with them, so I'm not familiar with any sort of diseases that effect them. This is likely what your arborist did.

It may be necessary to go to a finer grit on the end grain.  Sand, take a look for noticeable lines not following the grain, and try to correct those.  Work it till it looks good.  But no, you don't really want to do small circles unless you are going to a very fine grit."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3anror,Dreams_of_work,2,Mon Jun 22 16:13:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's a Fraxinus, or ash, tree.  The dry weather probably makes it a little less risky as far as rot goes, but with that many exposed areas, the chances are so greatly increased I don't think it matters.  Some of those sites will get infected.  I think the most risky part about this practice, though, isn't the increased chance of rot; it's that any new limbs are going to be extremely weakly attached.  Instead of the branch being anchored deeply into the parent limb, the new branches will only be hanging on to the outermost layer of bark.  If this tree were a building, it would be condemned for being not structurally sound and likely to collapse on its residents or its neighbors."

Also the branches will eventually come down if they are dead.  When the come down with wind sometimes they may do additional damage to lower branches or the tree trunk Itself when it splits.  I would rather control it with cutting it out myself.

It shot to the number one spot on the Eurochart Hot 100, where it remained for 12 weeks between June and early September 2004.  It topped the single charts in Germany and France for over three months, reached three in the United Kingdom and 72 on the U.S. Pop 100. The song became the fourth best-selling single of the 21st century in France, with 1,170,000 units sold.  A popular cover of the song was made by Romanian pop singer Haiducii, which also charted in many countries, especially Italy and Sweden where it topped the singles charts. The original song was made notable in the United States by the viral video of Gary Brolsma dancing to the song, calling it ""Numa Numa"".

marijuanaenthusiasts,3aa089,jdavid108,9,Thu Jun 18 12:18:24 2015 UTC,"Hey I have been an arborist for about 5 years on the west coast of Canada.  I worked my way up from groundsman to Forman. I climb and absolutely love it, also I run a boom truck ave do some Ipm work as well. Pros; it keeps me in good shape,            Climbing is fun,              Great scenery and views             I get to be outside all day  Cons; still work outside in shitty weather            Shearing hedges sucks            Some clients can be insanely frustrating  If you want to know anything else shoot me a message I'm on mobile right now but I'd be happy to help out a beginning arborist. All in all i love my job i couldn't see myself doing anything else."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3aa089,550treedude,3,Thu Jun 18 14:35:02 2015 UTC,"I'm no longer in the industry but, 2 cents:  The Good: Fitness, outdoors, semi-eco friendly  The Bad/Ugly: Pay not proportional to degree of hazard, lots of skids with little training/XP undercutting serious professionals, injury potential, seasonality (depending where you are, I'm in Canada and our winters are intense so there's not much work from Nov-March inclusive), not a career you can count on past your youth (climbers over 45 are few and far between), not a red seal trade so few standards  There is consulting, sales and inventorying you can do if you graduate out of climbing, and a lot of people really enjoy it.  The work culture where I am is somewhat prohibitive of anyone getting into those sides of things without spending around 5 years climbing.  There are some decent reasons for this but I feel like most people who like the climbing end up consulting/selling once their bodies wear out and they have few other options, and aren't there for the love.  Conversely, if you don't like the climbing but do like consulting it can be hard to be taken seriously without years of climbing experience.  My boss was an instructor at a local college and very safety conscious, but that didn't prevent an accident in which he inadvertently caused a falling chicot to land on a coworker's upper back from 30 feet up, while the coworker was using a chainsaw at face height.  Could have been a lot worse considering the circumstances, but I was in the ambulance with my buddy.  He had a broken back and was off work 6 months, could barely get any insurance money, they booted him off it as soon as possible and tried to push him into minimum wage jobs, and he will never be the same physically.  That's a horror story and not most people's experience, but similar things happen to enough people to matter and make it the second most lethal industry after mining.  With that said, things are changing fast and there's a lot of gear and safety standards now that didn't exist 10 years ago.  Not to mention people entering it with more education, etc.  If you love it, go for it.  But proceed with caution."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3aa089,k8000000,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:04:36 2015 UTC,I got into it because of my father. I put my time in and moved on. But he's still doing private jobs on his own. He still climbed everything himself. He just turned 60
marijuanaenthusiasts,3aa089,Crow486,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:55:01 2015 UTC,"Ok thank you for the info.  This clears up a lot for me.  So theoretically, if you were 33 years old, in decent physical shape and previously worked in other outdoor labor intensive jobs and were unhappy with current situation and was about to get ISA-CA would you say it would be worth my time to give it a go? I have a small 15K student loan dept and need around 14/hr to survive until I learn and prove myself enough to make more.  I really like adventure type sports and my last job involved a lot of intensive hiking with gear and I loved the gnar aspect to it and now I work an office job that im outside maybe 20% of the time and I am going insane.  Everyday takes tremendous effort psychologically to make it to 5pm.  Its a huge bummer. I am in Tennessee"
marijuanaenthusiasts,3aa089,k8000000,2,Fri Jun 19 01:52:16 2015 UTC,"The biggest risk is probably the cost of getting your gear together.  At a bare minimum you need your own saw pants (~$100, prob want 2 pairs), high vis, helmet (~$100), boots ($150 min), muffs ($50), glasses, lots of gloves.  If you're doing any climbing you'll need your own saddle, rope, biners, etc which adds up pretty fast - a basic kit will probably run you $1500, and that's very basic.  Of course everything's more expensive in Canada, so you may be able to get better deals where you are.  Either way that's a decent investment for something you're just taking a stab at.  If you know anyone in the industry whose climbing gear you can borrow to test out that can help.  Bigger companies pay less for low level positions but may be willing to supply PPE / gear.  You'll learn more slowly with them, though, whereas a smaller company may get you right into the tree faster, depending who's running it.  Make sure you go with a company that takes safety seriously and has insurance.  Don't do anything that feels unsafe to you.  If they try to macho you into anything tell them to fuck off.  Happy climbing. :) Tell me how it goes."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3a5y2y,PapaMancer,7,Wed Jun 17 21:56:20 2015 UTC,"There shouldn't be any problems. The seeds are mildly toxic, but are not attractive to dogs. Cattle can be killed if they ingest too many of the seeds or if they drink from a puddle where the seeds have soaked for a long time.   Nobody really wants to eat the seeds, it only happens by accident. If you don't have cattle or horses that will accidentally get them, it's all good."
marijuanaenthusiasts,3a5y2y,vainamo-,2,Wed Jun 17 14:32:51 2015 UTC,What about the pod pulp?  I've read differing reports as whether it's a sugary edible or toxic too.
marijuanaenthusiasts,3a5y2y,Sludgehammer,2,Thu Jun 18 02:26:13 2015 UTC,"I have heard it both ways too. The poison in the seeds is said to be neutralized when they are roasted, which is why they were able to be used as coffee.   As for the pulp, if there is poison in it, there is no roasting to remove it, so I'd not try it."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3a5y2y,graffiti81,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:40:58 2015 UTC,If you roast the seeds and then grind them they do make a coffee substitute. It can't have been very good because as soon as coffee became available regularly the settlers abandoned it.   The trees are not particularly dangerous and are quite attractive. Lucky you for having some around!

marijuanaenthusiasts,3a2vew,CoochCaboose,23,Wed Jun 17 00:36:42 2015 UTC,"you should put two stakes on either side and tie straps to them very loosely. The straps only prevent it from breaking in the wind. If you bind it to the stake the tree will not undergo proper secondary thickening in the xylem, making it much weaker in the long run. Basically if you don't make the tree get a bit of ""exercise"" from the wind, it won't get strong because it never needs to."

marijuanaenthusiasts,3a2vew,figurativelyliteral8,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:52:30 2015 UTC,"Honest answer: see what the stem looks like in the winter. It will drop it's leaves and leave a single stem. Even then, don't worry about it. Trees will seek vertical and light as they grow, and on non-transplant trees it's hard to fight. One common thing you can fix along the way is codominance (more than one leader), which is common in black walnut. You cut all but the best and prop the best straight up over the wound. With any luck it heals up straight."

It's continuing to grow, but whatever issue it's having is still spreading.  New growth comes in fine, but then as soon as another ""layer"" starts, the previous begins to die at the stem.  Also, it's a stem.  Shouldn't it be more trunkish given its height?  Lab for scale.  Please forgive the filthy carpets, the dogs just came in from a swim and decided to roll around.

marijuanaenthusiasts,39uu2i,Bearded_Deity,2,Mon Jun 15 02:37:55 2015 UTC,Anyway to tell the difference?
marijuanaenthusiasts,39uu2i,zezing,3,Mon Jun 15 16:04:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% positive aside from having it tested, because it does look very similar to other plant diseases. It is a fungus which produces spoors. And on top of that, there are different types of blight.  Blight takes wet weather, so if the area you live in has been in a dry spell for a few weeks with no rain, its probably not blight.   Look for areas of leaves that look wet, almost like morning dew on a plant. Or areas that look like mold growing on the plant.  Also, blight tends to affect the whole plant, not just the leaves. So look for areas on the limbs, or trunk that seem to be rotting or dying.  It's hard to say, mostly because blight looks so similar in its early stages, and not all types of blight look the same, or attack the plant the same. Also, if it IS blight, it will transfer really easily to other plants. So if it seems to be on this one tree now, but in a week you see the same symptoms on another plant, you may have a blight problem.  I hope this was at least a little helpful."

When interior portions of wood no longer feed any living tissues the tree uses them to sequester waste, gums, and most importantly tannins. These darken the wood and help prevent decay by being somewhat toxic to fungi. The darker lines either delineate sections that died off all at once, or sections where the tree responded to a fungal attack and was trying to wall it off from attacking the rest of the tree by laying down dark inhibitory chemicals. The line of dark that extends to the bark might even be the remains of the entry path a fungus took to get in to the tree in the first place."

They sting and hurt and every kid down here has stepped on one growing up.  I've used Sevin spray to kill them. Works fine.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Moth
marijuanaenthusiasts,39t0n0,petit_cochon,3,Sun Jun 14 14:44:34 2015 UTC,"Buck Moth:       The Buck Moth (Hemileuca maia ) is a common insect found in oak forests, stretching in the United States from the south east to the north east and as far west as Texas and Kansas.  The larvae typically emerge in a single generation in the spring. The larvae are covered in hollow spines that are attached to a poison sac. The poison can cause symptoms ranging from itching and burning sensations to nausea.   Mature larvae enter the soil to pupate in late June and emerge between October and December as moths to mate and lay eggs. Eggs are typically laid in spiral clusters on oak twigs.  In Louisiana, particularly in cities such as Baton Rouge or New Orleans, where use of live oaks as street trees is extensive, the caterpillars can become a significant nuisance for humans.  The caterpillars of this moth can also be found in some areas of Virginia, such as the Goshen Scout Reservation, where they are infamous for stinging people going to a summer camp in the area.

You can use Sevin (Carbaryl) like what /u/petit_cochon suggested, or you can use a less human-toxic alternative, Malathion. Just get one of those bottles that goes on the end of your garden hose and spray the whole tree down. Any insects on the tree will be killed. Sevin will also kill any crustaceans it comes into contact with, if runoff into a body of water is a concern."

Your best bet is to read about gypsy moth control, see what pesticides they use to kill them. Then read the wiki page on each of the chemicals you're considering so you can see if anything about your specific situation rules one of them out. I use malathion because it's less toxic for me and my pets and I live 1/2 mile away from the nearest water."

marijuanaenthusiasts,39qlq8,kopiko,7,Sun Jun 14 14:04:51 2015 UTC,"The leaves seem to be quite turgid, so it might not be water issue. And nearly all leaves are affected, regardless of their solar exposition. Still, it's possible explaination.  Yet, edge chlorosis progressing into necrosis is a common symptom of potassium deficiency. So my recommendation would be to try some nutrient supplementation, water it weekly (don't overdo it!) and avoid direct sunlight."
marijuanaenthusiasts,39qlq8,kopiko,4,Sat Jun 13 20:42:49 2015 UTC,How much water would you recommend per plant as I said before I've been using about 2 gallons but I don't want to overdo it I also don't want to starve it
marijuanaenthusiasts,39qlq8,Mybabyciv,5,Sat Jun 13 21:00:30 2015 UTC,"In a pot that size I'd go for dry all the way to your last knuckle (about 3 inches for my hand). Spathe (common name, which includes Peace Lily) do just fine drying out almost all the way occasionally. I would definitely say that plant got way too dry at least once though, and was probably over watered to compensate which is generally not a good idea. They really don't like being over watered. When they start to droop, you know you should have watered yesterday. You'll get a feel for it after a few weeks. To feed it, the easiest thing to use is Osmocote Plus Indoor Outdoor which should be just about perfect for it's nutritional needs. Just follow the label instructions and don't forget to reapply when it's time. Use it at half strength in the winter. (Do you even have those in Florida?)  How hot does it get under your carport? That could be a big factor in the burnt edges. Spath like shade, but sometimes carports can be more like a shady oven. If it gets to 110°F regularly it is too hot.  Just to be clear, over watering does not mean you gave it too much water at one time. It means that you are not letting it dry out enough between watering."
