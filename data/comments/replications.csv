replications,3djuxs,StingrayZ,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:38:42 2015 UTC,"2c-e is quite the interesting compound, but I personally have no interest in continuing research with it anymore.  Every other 2c I have experimented with I have loved, but this one is too problematic.  It causes me way too much for negative body effects, and the visual aspect of it hasn't been nearly as mindblowing since the first time I experimented with it a while back.  Also of note it has shown to have a very strong delirious streak to the headspace for me and several of my friends.  This has lead to me having hour long blackouts on and off during several of my trips.  That having been said, it works excellently in combination with other psychedelics for me as a booster.  I have combined it with both acid and 4-Aco-MET very successfully, both times producing some very unique and beautiful visuals!  Strangely, when done in combination as a booster of sorts, the bodyload was minimal if not completely gone for me.  This seems to be the only way I can enjoy it, but I may eventually relent and have one last go with it again at some point!"

replications,3cx0ym,Hyperactive_Filly,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:31:28 2015 UTC,yeahh.. i wouldnt say this is a good representation of dmt unless you were getting some extraordinarily weak shit

replications,3cx0ym,Hyperactive_Filly,2,Sat Jul 11 18:44:48 2015 UTC,even below breakthrough dmt is nuts as shit. this is rather tame in comparison. if you lemon tek 2g of mushrooms and smoke weed it would be at the level in this picture roughly ime.

replications,3c3oqd,Z_Designer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:19:56 2015 UTC,"Well, it's quite simple. At the essence - you take your image and make ome copies of it (in this case 10). Then you scale down each image by certain percentage (in my case, each image is 10% smaller than one before). You blur the edges of each image and make them appear in order. It's like staring at the wall on psychedelics, longer you stare, deeper the tunnel. :) As I'm witing this, I just came up with a new idea to make this even better :P"

Money can seem fucked up but it's easy to be taught the wrong thing about it. Money can be your enemy or it can be your friend, it's what you make it, or what you're taught to make it.  Perhaps people like you and me get aversion to money because it becomes associated with the gross decadence and inequality it enables, rather than the opportunities and possibilities it can enable; but really it's linked to both. Perhaps a psychologist can help you to deal with this, find a balance between who you are, what your desires are,  and societal demands; or perhaps you can escape from this society and into one where money doesn't play a part, there's cults and communes that can help with that. I guess my point is, there's options, but they aren't necessarily easy; so it's a good thing we're capable of great things when confronted with a challenge. And also failure, because shit happens. But failure is only ever a temporary thing.  Hope you find the balance you've really been after all this time, get what you desire to desire sorted out. Get a good night's sleep when the opportunity presents itself, and remember, society doesn't get to say who you are, what you have to do, or who you have to be, only you get to make that call.

replications,3ai2a8,DarthRedditAlien,6,Sat Jun 20 17:37:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, me. Quite accurate, within certain limits. Ayahuasca itself was slightly different, more like a waking nightmare than this, but still quite similar with the fractal machinery and creatures and general dislocation. However what this is most like is changa, DMT-infused herbs smoked.  Most people who ""take"" Ayahuasca are not initiated, and initiation can take years or a lifetime. The animators of this clip sourced their information from experiences of indigenous users of Ayahuasca and took an initiation similar to what is shown in the film themselves.  Also consider that ""Ayahuasca"" refers to both a vine and a brew, and the recipes for the brew can be very individualised. Inevitably, trips will vary. As with most ethnobotanical psychadelics, cultural context is everything.   So, it's a film, it's problematic. But this particular scene (and the film in general) was well researched, and it fits with some Ayahuasca experiences recorded out there."

replications,3ai2a8,HubertBonisseur,4,Mon Jun 22 23:48:27 2015 UTC,"Ufft, there's some sociocultural baggage to unpack in why ayahuasca is a sought after trip. Part of it is to do with the fact the West hasn't preserved any of its shamanistic traditions very well, and people yearn for that kind of connection with the real world. Pentacostalist churches are an example of this, i think.  This is just my opinion. I searched out ayahuasca when i was younger and possibly more foolish: i thought it would give me a real insight into the workings of the universe. Instead it gave me an uncomfortably profound insight into my own psyche, which if anything is more useful."

replications,3ah7gz,appliedphilosophy,12,Sat Jun 20 03:48:18 2015 UTC,"I'd say because psychedelics take your ""this is what a banana/temple/tree should look like,"" and then when ya see something that resembles a banana/temple/tree, you see what it really is (coat hanger, person) but you feeeeel a banana/temple/tree. Unless it's huge doses or Dmt, it's not a visual thing I don't think, it's more about the merging of the conscious and unconscious parts of your mind.   Lemme copy paste a comment I made on another post about this, cause it kinda applies.   This is the human experience multiplied upon itself. A dog, with nothing around to see it, just exists. It's not a ""d-o-g, dog,"" or a ""fuzzy animal that says woof,"" it just exists. Then a human comes along, points, and says ""doggy!"" And then this blob of things that were perfectly happy being nothing in particular, becomes particularly something. A dog.   This algorithm is this squared. It can see something like clouds or trees, say ""doggy!"" and then those clouds or trees are not clouds or trees, but rather, are dogs.   You can't say what is or what is not correct, because the universe itself really doesn't hold much shape or form without anyone in the forest to hear the tree fall. It's all waves and 99% empty space, no matter what you call it.   It'd be interesting to see an inverse program. Take an image that is definitely a dog, or a tower, or trees, or clouds, and then turn it into something that is arguably not a dog, or not a tower, nor trees, nor clouds.   The interesting thing is that this might actually be the same exact algorithm. When it comes to 2d images, to create and to destroy are pretty damn similar. Like the trippy squirrel dog thing. It is arguably now, not a squirrel, the squirrel has been destroyed. However, in the process, the slug seal dog car abomination has been created.   Fun."

Google uses neural modelling, i.e. modelling brain activity, which uses feedback loops like our own brains do. The neurotransmitter serotonin is particularly involved in pattern regognition and when it is in high concentration (e.g. When on psychedelics) pattern recognition is in overdrive: the feedback loop becomes more prominent.  What amazes me the most is the sheer computational power that we posess. Our brain can render a fluid motion of these images in real time, ultra high res, and it does not even feel slightly hard to do so.

The highly defined 3d geometry is unique as dissociatives usually have dream states or hypnagogia-like immersive hallucinations and psychedelics are usually 2d geometric eye candy. Together they have fully inmersive,  completely defined, 3d (seems almost tangible), and constantly moving and changing geometry.   Good shit mane"

replications,3ab1qe,appliedphilosophy,2,Fri Jun 19 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this gives us insight into our own nervous system and how our brain processes images. Perhaps these hallucinations of fractals are simply a broken-down version of how our brain interprets data from the visual cortex—like we were stripping away some polishing layers of the network.  Have you ever just stared at a white wall (while sober), and observed the small minutiae of details and imperfection in the texture? I noticed that what I was focused on was very clear, however if I tried to concentrate on the outer field of my vision—without actually moving my eyes—I would see replicas of those same details and imperfections, in similar fractal patterns as these images. (Almost like looking at something pattern-stamped in Photoshop.)   As soon as I focus on that outer area I was concentrating on, the details resolve—the fractal patterns go away and my brain switches to seeing what's actually there. It seems that the ""filling-in"" that your brain does (since most of what you see is actually just made up by your brain and not actually physically seen) could be based on a similar mechanism to what is creating the fractals in these neural networks.   Edit: well, I guess someone already noticed this and gave it a name: Symmetrical Texture Repetition"

replications,3ab1qe,TomBakerFTW,5,Thu Jun 18 21:17:04 2015 UTC,"I'll post something I put in another thread about this:  The reason these pictures look somewhat like hallucinating under psychoactive substances is due to the fact that your brain's pattern recognition when under the influence of psychedlics is ridiculously overdriven.  In other words, psychedelic drugs increase the brain's perception of patterns, leading to an increase in visual pattern recognition phenomena such as phosphenes.  These drawings are actually a result of pattern recognition software used to aggregate data. It's no surprise that these pictures look the way they are. What's possibly more interesting is that this clearly shows that there is a certain way of recognising patterns that occurs when neural networks are involved, whether they be computer-based or biological."

That night I saw the psychedelic grid behind the stars, more strongly than I ever have before.  The grid was formed by an interlocking network of rainbow colored 3d fern/tree fractals that grew out kaleidoscopically from behind each star and connected them all!  After enjoying the stars lying down, I stood up, and when I did the grid was creating a giant dome surrounding the earth, even going behind the mountains surrounding us.
