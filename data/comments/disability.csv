Hand bikes and lift machines with extra handles and a hydraulic lift for getting in and out of the heated pool and a bunch of other stuff. If you have one near you it might be a great place to start.   Otherwise you could look at the hand bikes on amazon. They're fairly small and portable but not the most stable things since they have to sit on a table. Just a couple ideas.

disability,3dubmw,cloaknodagger,5,Tue Jul 21 03:29:22 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, in the States it is based on how much you have contributed to Social Security. If you were born disabled and unable to work...tough luck. I really don't understand why everyone just doesn't receive the same livable income. Something around $1500/month would likely work with affordable/assisted housing. But that's just not how it is. I basically use disability for the insurance as I couldn't survive on what little monetary assistance they provide. Luckily I was able to work throughout college and a few years before my condition made most jobs impossible in my early 20's. That said, I still work when I am able, but most jobs for me in my area are low pay and seasonal. I have an IT degree, but no job offers. Generally speaking, I believe you can earn up to 25k/year in total earnings through work and disability combined without losing benefits. Of course, unless you are destitute, you won't be getting prescription drug coverage which is what empties my bank account quicker than anything.  The only trainable job offers seem to be telecommuting customer service jobs with mandatory lay-offs. Unfortunately, my sketchy hearing prevents me from taking those.  I net around $900/month. 80% medical coverage, but no prescription, no supplemental, no dental, no eyeglasses. I'm certain some people can work the system better than I and get more, but I choose to save money in the bank which won't help you get additional aid.  I also moved back in with the parents after college, which I'm sure doesn't help what I receive.

I misread this originally -- I get a few hundred dollars more per month than you do, because I defied my doctors and managed to work an extra 10 months at a brilliant job, and then quit working cold turkey. The year before that, they'd offered me $760. It's all, as you know, based on how much your salary was in the quarters leading up to your quitting work. Many people suffer because of that -- they often try to reduce their hours, or go part time, before filing for disability. That can really tank your payment.  The average for 2015 is $1165. You can earn up to $2663 per month, but keep in mind that that number includes the additional amount you get per child that you have. Someone who has a base benefit near yours, but has 4 kids, would actually receive a check much larger than yours, at least until the kids are 18+.  So, I dunno. It's sort of like asking someone's salary. There are a lot of things that factor into it, and, if they answer, the number you get may not tell the full story in itself."

Other things I do: computer gaming is cheaper than console gaming for entertainment. Find some hobbies you love (wood carving for me) and make an INVESTMENT in the tools you need to do those hobbies. They'll keep you sane and functional, so it's worth it. After that, I give myself an allowance every week ($50 for me) and that's all I'm allowed to spend on hobby/games/personal stuff.

That said, it seems like her stubbornness isn't helping. Depending on the layout of the office, she could possibly do a much better job from a wheelchair than walking. Especially if it's motorized, so she can drive easily. A chair is not a trap, she can always get up and walk when it suits her. And rolling into a job interview, then standing to shake hands, would possibly be better than hobbling in, because it shows she's taking control of her mobility."
disability,3drj9f,Crivens1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:17:06 2015 UTC,"I would agree about considering using a wheelchair or scooter, which might help with being able to perform the essential tasks of this or any job. It's a tough pill to swallow but would make her more mobile, not less. I didn't realize until I became disabled that there are quite a few of us who can still walk some but use a wheelchair so that we are not limited by how far our bodies decide we're allowed to walk that day. Even if she doesn't qualify under insurance, you can often find used power chairs on Craigslist.  I would suggest looking up Job Accommodation Network. It's a site/service run by the Dept of Labor that helps employers and employees figure out accommodations and disability rights. They can help her figure out if she needs to ask for accommodations and how to do so."
disability,3drj9f,punstersquared,2,Sun Jul 19 05:02:36 2015 UTC,"Working from home could be an option. Transcribing or some such thing. As for them ""squeezing her out"" if her ambulation is really that poor they're probably trying to avoid a worker's comp case. There is the possibility that if she began using a wheelchair they would be feel more secure in her ability to manuver safely around the office and as long as she maintains her level of work, they may back off. Obviously I can't say that for certain but it's a possibility. I think a prospective employer will definitely have reservations about hiring someone who hobbles into an interview. They would be taking on a risk, and that doesn't make sense business-wise. And most employers are not going to want to hire someone who demonstrates that level of stubborness right off the bat by refusing to use an ambulation aid. Your wife has a right to do that, certainly, it's her health and her decision. But there are consequences that go along with making a choice like that.  Biggest one being The Fall. I'm only 30, but I worked in the medical field for 13 years, so I know all about The Fall. I like my bones intact, so I got a cane as soon as walking became problematic. And I love it. I feel better, more secure, more independent, etc. Canes or chairs are just like eye glasses: a tool to improve your quality of life. Even if she only uses it at home to give herself a break that might be enough. I'm on Team Cane, as you can see. Either way, I hope things work out for you guys."
disability,3drj9f,jlmitch12,2,Sun Jul 19 00:12:49 2015 UTC,"First of all, that's horrible that her job is trying to squeeze her out (and could possibly be against the law).  I guess I understand no longer wanting to work in that sort of atmosphere.  However, if she's good at what she does, her using a chair/getting around slowly shouldn't matter.  If she'd want to stay, could you look at any Aging and Disability Resources to help her legally?  With that said (and I guess sort of going into the question of finding another job), I know that some positions might spectate her working and see how much she accomplishes in a given hour.  They then base their pay on the amount of work they finish.  This might be different state to state (and personally, I've never been faced with this sort of ""trial run""), but I've seen signs that talk about doing so up in the break-room at one of my jobs.  I'd also recommend getting some help from a group called DVR (District of Vocational Rehabilitation).  In the city I live in, they share the building with a company that also aids people in finding jobs.  Though due to your wife's disability, they could give her a bit more help (whether it be disability related or how to conduct yourself in an interview) than just a regular job-seeking outfit.  Again, any future employer also shouldn't judge a hopeful employee's potential even if they are ""hobbling"" around.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen (I've heard from a previous employer after I had been hired that some managers had doubts on my abilities since I'm a wheelchair user), but chances are, she won't want to work for a company that turns her down due to her circumstances anyways.    Hopefully this helped!  Good luck to your wife!"

disability,3dn694,J_J_Rousseau0,3,Fri Jul 17 17:06:20 2015 UTC,"What? No self lacing Air-Mags lol?    This is interesting. I like the idea and hope it will help many people out, but I can't help but think this is a bit of a means for Nike to get some great PR while using recycled technology they've been incorporating in their shoes for years.   I've worked in a shoe store for a long time and in the process, become quite the ""sneaker history buff"" lol and aficionado. Nike and other brands have made secure fitting laceless designs since the mid 90s. Shoes like the Air Kukini, Presto Faze, Presto Cage all used elastic polymer bands for support in place of traditional laces; while others like the Air Rift used a series of velcro straps including a heel mounted strap for support similar to the one found on this upcoming release. I believe the elastic laces were first used by Nike on a pair of Jordans a few years back and there is even a company that specializes in nothing but elastic laces.   Either way, I think it's wonderful they mish mashed all these technologies together to assist those with trouble tying their shoes and overall this will be extremely good for the sneaker industry. Nike is the leader of the industry and masters of advertising so when they promote something, even if they weren't the originators of the technology, other companies tend to follow suit very quickly. I'd expect to see a lot more shoes like this hitting the market in the coming years.   Edit: Just looked it up and the company that makes the elastic laces is called ""Lock Laces"".    Additionally here's a brief list of some sneakers without traditional laces for those who may be looking for different styles or simply aren't LeBron fans lol.   -Nike Air Rift: Originally made for Kenyan Olympic runners who were accustomed to running barefoot. These use a split toe design (Like a Ninja shoe!) to mimic the foots natural movement as the Kenyans were used to running barefoot, but per Olympic rules had to wear some kind of footwear to compete. These aren't released regularly and can get a bit pricey on the resale market. They also have a rather feminine design, so probably won't be a favorite for the guys.   -Nike Hurache 94 - Easy on easy off Velcro design with old school stylish looks.   -Nike Kukini - Elastic polymer net that can be tightened at the heel covers the shoe in place of laces. Original Kukinis are pretty scarce but a few years ago Nike released the Kukini Free, which used the same upper with their ""free"" soles. These didn't sell to well and can still be had all over ebay for reasonable prices.   -Puma Disc - I've always wanted these for the novelty factor, but they could be very beneficial for someone with CP or trouble with traditional laces. These use a series of wires connected to a dial in the middle of the shoe, that when turned tightens the wires providing a snug fit in place of the laces.   -Reebok Pump Fury - These use an air bladder in place of laces, that when pumped expands to provide a snug fit.   There are quite a few more laceless designs out there if anyone's interested, but the aforementioned list includes shoes that have been in production in the past few years and should still be relatively attainable."

disability,3dn694,Briannkin,2,Fri Jul 17 22:01:52 2015 UTC,"It's always nice when a big company like Nike designs something cool and fashionable with disabled people in mind. I wasn't able to tie my own shoes till I was like 12, and even now I am a bit slow at it (however, being a girl, I have a lot of options when it comes to slip ons and zipper shoes). I think the $130 price tag is a bit much for any shoe, but from what I've seen, that is kinda on-par with other Nike shoes.

Adaptive technology/shoes/etc. shouldn't be prohibitively expensive to the people who need it most.   What could we(as people with disabilities) do that might have a tangible effect on this?
disability,3dn694,tornadospoon,2,Fri Jul 17 18:02:22 2015 UTC,"An argument in favor of the cost:  Nike is a brand name that the general public thinks is cool and has the cache to charge a higher price for that reason. By marketing these in the same way (and for a similar cost) as they would any other shoe, Nike tells consumers that this IS just like any other designer shoe they sell and is meant to appeal to everyone, not just those with disabilities. This works to promote a marketplace in which universally accessible designs are part of the norm and can be high-end products in their own right instead of a sub market meant to appeal solely to (and effectively differentiate in an ultimately negative way) those with disabilities.   It reflects a trend in glasses, which I think is ultimately a good thing. After all, the most inclusive designs are those that work well for disabled persons but are cool enough for everyone else to want as well.   Plus, $130 for fly-as-fuck shoes is cheap. Especially when they're also a medical device for those who use them out of necessity."
disability,3dn694,MrsTtt,3,Sat Jul 18 22:02:35 2015 UTC,"Huh, I didn't think of it that way. Good point! And now that I think about, my favorite pair of shoes has always been from Nike.

disability,3dn694,LeOneLeggedLovely,2,Sun Jul 19 04:16:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm glad I could provide another perspective. Obviously, I wish the price point was much lower, but I really do think that making this 'just another shoe' is a great way to integrate universal design into the larger market. If this shoe takes off (I really hope it does), it could inspire more shoe companies to make similar products and create an ecosystem in which the universal design principles used to develop shoes are secondary to the incredible designs they reproduce.  and any chance  those shoes you liked are the nike flyknits? I've seen them before, but they seem to fit your description closely. They do have laces, but I can see how they're secondary or not needed for everyday use.   also, full disclosure, I am fully able bodied (is there a more polite term for that in comparison to disabled/differently abled?). I studied universal design as a hobby in college (graduated a year ago) and have a sibling who is physically/mentally disabled, but I do not have a personal experience that informs my views.

Colorways, model variations and production numbers can have a DRASTIC effect on the price of a sneaker. Take the Reebok Pump Fury for example. Their ""HLS"" variant can be found online in the neighborhood of $50, while their camouflage BAPE variant runs roughly $500 and their ultra limited collaboration with Chanel goes for as much as a decent used car.   I recommend finding a model you like, maybe trying them on in-store to account for proper sizing and then running that model name through various search engines and ebay and seeing what pops up. You may not be able to find that certain colorway you love at a reasonable price, but unless you're craving a pair of Yeezys, chances are more affordable colorway will turn up somewhere."
disability,3dn694,LeOneLeggedLovely,2,Sat Jul 18 20:24:47 2015 UTC,"To each their own, but I wouldn't consider $130 prohibitively expensive. It's not cheap by any means, but LeBrons signature shoes retail at $220. The mere fact that his name is attached to these shoes means they will cost more than their more generic entry level models.   Usually I would say don't buy them, but this case is rather conflicting. If people don't buy them, Nike sees no market, other brands see no market and the likelihood of anyone producing more shoes like is is greatly reduced. If people do buy at the stated price-point, then Nike sees a market, but in typical Nike fashion... they hike up the prices.   The best case and most likely scenario IMO, is these sell well and other brands take note. Nikes are usually priced higher than the competition, so if Puma, Reebok, etc. see these are selling, they will likely manufacture their own variations on the idea at a lower price-point. Considering LeBrons name is attached to the shoe, I presume they will sell rather well. Not only to those in need of this kind of shoe, but the average consumer as well. Lots of people like Nikes, lots of people like Lebron and lots of people like bells and whistles on their shoes. Even though these were created with people with CP in mind, I can see the combination of their laceless design, sippers and velcro straps being enticing to anyone who simply likes fancy sneakers.   I suppose if enough people were to petition or write Nike, and they saw a market, they may be inclined to release more shoes in a similar vein at a lower price-point, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Nikes prices seem to skyrocket every few years with no rhyme or reason. My favorite model, the Presto Classic, just re-released at $130, when just a few years ago they retailed at $79. Irks the hell out of me, especially now that I only require a single shoe so I'm basically throwing $65 away for nothing. But what can I say, I still bought them anyway lol."

disability,3dlmld,Avrozavr,2,Fri Jul 17 07:10:16 2015 UTC,"Are your muscles too tight to lift, or is it more of a strength issue?  If the legs aren't too stiff to lift, could you loop a cord under your foot or ankle and pull it upwards?"
disability,3dlmld,LittleBlueEyes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:32:46 2015 UTC,Could you use a leg lifter to bring on leg up and cross it over the other? http://www.mobility-aids.com/leg-lifters.html
disability,3dlmld,awesomesauce1483,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:41:03 2015 UTC,"I think it is a bit of both, as I have spastics. A cord? maybe, but i need my hands free to pull the pants."
disability,3dlmld,LittleBlueEyes,2,Fri Jul 17 07:38:14 2015 UTC,"A cord or a rope, I'm imagining would work.  Uh, make sure the rope is clean and hold the end in your teeth?    I don't have physical disabilities, so I'm guessing wildly at what might work for you.  :)"

disability,3dmeiu,Leenalia,0,Fri Jul 17 13:23:41 2015 UTC,Adding that your reaction to getting fired after what you've been through is understandable to me. I'm sorry you had a run of bad luck with these jobs. :(

disability,3dmeiu,RambleRamble,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:11:57 2015 UTC,"From just the basic information you've given me about your hearing you wouldn't qualify based on that alone. You didn't say whether those numbers were aided/unaided but even if those numbers are aided your hearing loss isn't severe enough (in of itself) to become disabling (for example to automatically qualify your speech discrimination has to be less than 40%) .  Mentally, all i can say is that the fact you have no treatment will work against you. They'll set you up with a Consultative Exam but really that is just to get enough evidence to deny you (since its been 5 years since an audiometric exam they'll probably send you to one of those as well.   You've said it yourself, you do feel like you can work. You say that ""everyone else says I am"" but, honestly, 99.9% of people have no idea what the definition of disability according to SSA is. And based on your limited work history there is a chance you won't even qualify non-medically to be considered (assuming youre assets are too high due to your husband working).  But, even though I don't think you won't qualify that the person who actually works your case (and has access to all your medical records) would have to make that determination. I think that there is no harm in you applying just to see what happens. The worst that will happen is that you'll get told ""no"""
disability,3dmeiu,RambleRamble,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"Actually the speech discrimination score, many places online say that it's supposed to be at 40% OR the 60dB threshold.  Very few have it as both, that's why I decided to ask here.  Maybe some one managed to get disability for their hearing loss and know what's up?"
disability,3dmeiu,RambleRamble,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:14:06 2015 UTC,"the 60db threshold is for the bone conduction. the air conduction threshold is much higher (90db I think, I dont have my stuff with me) and both scores have to be higher than the threshold. so if you are 60db for both then it would not automatically qualify (meet listing) for disability.   edit: sorry I didn't realize you were the OP. changed verb/noun structure."
disability,3dhgqt,TinyLittleStormCloud,2,Thu Jul 16 08:38:28 2015 UTC,What exactly is the Disability Treaty? I can't seem to find a straight answer anywhere.
disability,3dhgqt,redhottaco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:31:39 2015 UTC,"This article is pretty old.  It's dated April 2015 but it clearly was posted pre-September 2014.  That's when Sen. Mike Lee of Utah killed any chance of ratification by rejecting Sen. Harkin's request for unanimous consent to debate the issue.  Harkin has since retired, and there isn't a real push to get it up for vote again soon."
disability,3dhgqt,PlugItIn1217,3,Thu Jul 16 20:46:25 2015 UTC,"It is unlikely to be ratified soon. I've worked on this the last couple of times. Unless supporters in the Senate can pull a few more Republicans it simply won't happen until the Dems retake more seats. It has become easy for Republicans to point at anything with a U.N. stamp and cry ""witch!"""
disability,3dhgqt,Duckie1080,2,Thu Jul 16 15:05:14 2015 UTC,"I did a law review article on this. I argue that the U.S. is bound by international customary law through the history of the disability rights movement.   Otherwise, this is old news."
disability,3dhgqt,ViviMan65,3,Thu Jul 16 13:52:00 2015 UTC,"It won't happen. The U.S. has signed the treaty, but the government hasn't ratified it, which boils down to official acceptance of the treaty by the legislative body of the country. The U.S. is notorious for ratifying pretty much nothing from the UN. It's worth fighting for, but the chances of success are pretty slim. For example, U.S. remains the only country with a functioning government to not have ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The other country is Somalia."
