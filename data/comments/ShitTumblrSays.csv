ShitTumblrSays,3dwr5t,Kiloueka,2,Mon Jul 20 04:22:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's a natural progression from the usual online argument tactic of pretending the other person is getting ""emotional"" or ""outraged"" - you could be emotionally cool as the smoke off dry ice, and people would still accuse you of it. They're the rational, clear-thinking one, so if you're disagreeing you must be doing so out of emotion, not because you just don't share their opinion. They are purely rational, intelligent people, and intelligent people don't argue from something so base as emotions.  Shit, I've seen a dude get in an argument with a markov chain bot(not knowing it's a bot) and accuse it of getting emotional."

ShitTumblrSays,3cr2sg,Zennistrad,12,Fri Jul 10 02:25:21 2015 UTC,"Last edit was made 2 days ago by DaKoopaKing   lol, sounds about right  But yeah, it's impossible to argue with the constantly shifting goalposts and link spam common beyond this one issue, really. I will read one or two links from another person if I'm interested in the conversation and assume it's in good faith, but I'm very confused by who they think they're going to catch with this document. Is it just to waive it around and go, ""You can't refute this [thing that is impossible to refute]""?   I see this often enough on Tumblr for a bunch of different things. A couple weeks ago it was that Sasha Grey was a sex slave or something and it had a bunch of ""sources"" in the bottom that all went back to the same sketchy website, but each source was labelled differently so the case appeared much stronger than it was. Similarly, every MLK Day there's a bunch of edgy stuff on my dash about how the government killed MLK that is ""sourced"" to a million different sites like alternet and gmen-shot-drking.info.  I want to believe this is more a problem of people not understanding how to write a persuasive case for something than it is some malicious, deliberately deceitful tactic, but I'm pretty sure at least the OP doc is definitely in the malicious, deliberately deceitful category."
ShitTumblrSays,3cr2sg,__shoe__,3,Fri Jul 10 16:31:01 2015 UTC,"I think people want their posts to look like academic articles, which are often packed that densely with citations. The difference being that (generally) the cited articles will be from reputable sources, the authors will have actually read the cited material and they're only citing them because it's necessary. In an academic article it's quality papers/book/etc. cited in vast quantity to provide a solid platform of science from which to build on.  These people are just copying that in an attempt to give off the impression of a solid base so that they can start shovelling their opinions down people's throats. They're typically not quality citations at all and the quantity just makes it worse."
ShitTumblrSays,3cr2sg,Virtualfox,3,Wed Jul 15 09:46:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is often the case. On Tumblr, though, sometimes what I see is an obscure issue that isn't true -- ""the government killed MLK"" -- turned into something like, ""Hey guys, no one EVER talks about this, but here are all the places you can go read up on it. [10 links] White people, right?"" But there is very little written on the subject, so most of the links are restating a one or two original articles or incestuously linking back to other articles in an unoriginal way. Seven or eight links is actually one source diluted into several that are restating it or adding into it with hearsay/additional conspiracy. It all feeds into this ""LOOK, THE INFORMATION IS OUT THERE. IT'S JUST NO ONE'S TALKING ABOUT IT."" Similar to the phenomenon we see often enough on this site where a dude is like, ""Why's no one talking about [story that's received thousands of upvotes and is on Google News right now]?""  I think it's a different problem in different cases. Some people don't know how to use sources properly, so they, like you say, are just throwing stuff into a post or document to make it seem official. Other people have an agenda and are using the flood of sources in bad faith. These people might know it's not right, but they believe they are fundamentally right and that any means are appropriate to get more converts.  The people who are spreading that content as MRA/conspiracy theorist foot soldiers might see it as serious scholarly work because ""the sources!! Can't argue facts!!""   When you are trying to be persuasive and you have hella papers and facts and all that on your side, there's still gotta be some cogent point that the information is all building around -- especially in casual internet writing -- which is often not the case. It's gotten to the point where my radar goes off when I see ""too many"" sources, but that's maybe more a sign that I'm not an academic than anything..."

However, it's not everyone else's job to warn you of those triggers.  I've dealt with depression/PTSD-like symptoms and one of the biggest things the therapy dealt with was how to recognize triggers and fight them.  It's ridiculous to think that I'll never be triggered again in my life because they will come up in movies, books, music or just conversation.  So it's up to me to recognize triggers and be able to not let them drag me back down, not everyone else's to read my mind.  The fact that they have this idea shows that they have very little understanding of mental illness."
ShitTumblrSays,3bwve4,LeductioAdAbsurdism,3,Fri Jul 3 04:41:18 2015 UTC,"I agree that approaching this as ""use trigger warnings so that no one ever is triggered ever again"" is shortsighted. The use of trigger warnings should be seen as a response to a need, but not a cure to the problem. That said, not everyone is at the stage where they are ready to fight those battles with their triggers, and it is not my job to impose when or how they decide to fight that battle. In light of that, I'll continue to tag anything as a trigger if asked to do so even if prima facie it seems absurd to me."

Shouldn't seeing that be enough to make them hear the word in their head and trigger them?  ""Slight discomfort"" sounds a bit silly too. If I hear a song that I liked 10 years ago and it reminds me of something embarrassing I did in a relationship as a teenager and that makes me slightly uncomfortable, is that a trigger? I suppose I'm asking in the wrong sub, really."
ShitTumblrSays,3bwve4,backblird,3,Fri Jul 3 02:50:27 2015 UTC,"Mine isn't much of an answer, but some browser add-ons/extensions for tumblr allow you to filter by tags, so you wouldn't see posts about, say, penguins, at all.

Modern Armenia is essentially a creation of Russia, and the 1800s were a shitty time to be an Azeri in the area of modern Armenia, although mostly Russian directed.

They did seem to be against the idea of cis/privileged people visiting their blog, but for what mostly seems to be good reasons; the blog was mostly used as a place to vent about transmisogyny and shit. Most of their posts are tagged ""don't reblog"" so I'll respect that and not post screenshots here; it looks like they made their theme broken for a reason.  I did find they reblogged this post, which is pretty relevant and begs the question of whether it was made satirically or not."
