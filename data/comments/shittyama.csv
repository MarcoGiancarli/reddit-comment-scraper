shittyama,3dmhx6,I_play_nose_flute,2,Fri Jul 17 15:57:17 2015 UTC,"Vinegars cause all sorts of problems whenever there are too many of them around. Vinegars are not useful to society in any way. They are instead a burden on the rest of the non-vinegar condiments.  Vinegars, with their sourness and acidity and overall harshness, can and do cause people's faces - particularly the chin part of the face - to frown, to wrinkle, and especially to pout.  The name of this phenomenon is a ""chin pout,"" and these so-called ""chin pouts"" happen very frequently in areas where there are lots of vinegars."

shittyama,3cmso5,hansarsch,2,Thu Jul 9 04:44:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, a lot of the things you are mentioning make pretty much no sense to me. I'm slightly confused as to your initial post stating that you don't know what you are doing because it looks to me like you know what you want to be doing which seems to me like you would be working on getting there(Maybe you just don't know how you're going to get there, which I think is one of those dilemmas everyone has). I think you have an advantage in knowing what you want because I know plenty of people who have no idea what they want to be working in/doing in the future.  Either way, I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors."

shittyama,3bzkpp,jumb1,2,Fri Jul 3 12:50:09 2015 UTC,"I spent years chasing it man. Got so close a few times but could never reach it. Always just out of reach. Eventually, the rabbit's lead would get greater and greater and I retired. Apparently, I wasn't fast enough so they took my balls. My nuts, man! I spent 4 yours in the pen until a fat guy with a beard adopted me. He smells like people food so it's all good. The rabbit still haunts my dreams, however. What if?"

shittyama,3buy7r,-ogre-,2,Thu Jul 2 10:49:49 2015 UTC,When tossing out  a small dough for a pizza its not uncommon for it to go flying out your hand across the kitchen on the floor. We usually always still serve because they're a bitch to slap out and fuck walking all the way back to walkin while were in a rush. With that said though you know oven would probably kill off anything on there.
