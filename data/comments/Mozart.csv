Mozart,3bd1f7,SuperBreakfast,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:45:31 2015 UTC,"“I was very nervous at the rehearsal, for never in my life have I heard a worse performance. Next day I had decided not to go to the concert at all; but in the evening, the weather being fine, I at last made up my mind to go. Right in the middle of the first allegro was a passage I knew the audience would like; they were thrilled with it and there was a tremendous burst of applause. The andante also found favour, but particularly the last allegro. I was so happy that as soon as the symphony was over I went off to the Palais Royal where I had a large ice, said the Rosary as I had vowed to do, and went home.”   Mozart on this symphony"
Mozart,3bbo22,SuperBreakfast,2,Sat Jun 27 18:01:35 2015 UTC,Too many notes.
Mozart,384bvd,chriswrightmusic,2,Mon Jun 1 19:31:48 2015 UTC,Someone who shares my passion for Mozart!
Mozart,36vx4f,chriswrightmusic,2,Fri May 22 15:26:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, I look forward to the other episodes."

Mozart,34ecgs,chriswrightmusic,1 point,Mon May 11 14:58:35 2015 UTC,"These portraits during that period certainly make their subjects look unattractive.  I mean not just Mozart, but everyone.  They are all just so bad at representing the people that they are supposed to portray.  That being said, Mozart's wife, Constanze, must have been absolutely gorgeous because I have never seen a bad portrait of her."
Mozart,32awb1,Mercury-Redstone,2,Sun Apr 12 04:08:10 2015 UTC,Oh cool! I recommend for the symphonies Karl Bohm. He is a bit slower and the recordings are old but they really are a very polished interpretation.
Mozart,32awb1,SasoriDama,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:54:29 2015 UTC,"Absolutely second this. Bohm is my favourite for the symphonies, he produces very cohesive interpretations as you say."
Mozart,32any9,tumos9423,5,Sun Apr 12 02:43:17 2015 UTC,"Mozart's father had an interesting relationship with his son, you could definitely include an entire paper on this (nurturing, development, infuriating rationalization in the latter years) -- as well as: Nannerl (his sister) and him would perform together, perhaps refine on that, when they were young His time spent in Salzburg, how did the Court treat him? His friendship with Franz Joseph Haydn, and how their works influenced each other His many illnesses that he suffered from during his life, especially when traveling by carriage The importance of his works: what makes them so 'human' and recognizable to such a large audience? Read through his letters. It will take time, but you will get an unfiltered glimpse into his life, and it is rewarding- as they are often funny The development of his symphonic repertoire (the transition from No. 1 to 41 is amazing, and people often rule out 1-35, for the most part) Track his performances, he really got around and met many people. Many significantly historically people, might I add. He owned a pet bird. It was a Starling that could sing, he loved it so dearly he dedicated a piano concerto to it, and according to a letter, cried on the day of its death Explore his chamber music, write about them, because they are heartfelt and full of material to engage in (see: divertimento works, wind ensembles) He really was a composer at the cross of two eras. You'll find plenty of things to write about, if you need any help - just message me!     Edit: Thank you so much for the gold! You're too kind <3  Now I'm certainly going to make sure you get an A+ on that paper"
Mozart,32any9,SuperBreakfast,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:53:12 2015 UTC,Wow! Thank you so much. The whole section of his life with the archbishop in Salzburg is a very interesting history -we've discussed that at length in my course. I think I could do something about his traveling and tie that in since it was a primary source of  the problem with the court there. This is more than enough to get started looking at things!  Thank you!!
Mozart,32any9,SuperBreakfast,2,Sun Apr 12 03:00:56 2015 UTC,"You're very welcome :D  It just so happens I turned a room into my house into a library, so I've got a mound of primary sources at my disposal. I've got about fifteen or twenty scholarly books on Mozart, so if you need any assistance on your topic at all, I will certainly explore. This is fun for me!  I'll send you a list of all my books. Here's a quick image of only a handful of them, to show you for kicks."
Mozart,32any9,Stink-Finger,2,Sun Apr 12 03:05:07 2015 UTC,Read this:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393328309/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  It will give you a real insight into his life and the times that surrounded it.
Mozart,2xr8s8,SuperBreakfast,1 point,Tue Mar 3 05:09:36 2015 UTC,Haha I love this one! It's a good beginner piece too.

Mozart,2nt14k,SasoriDama,1 point,Sun Nov 30 16:57:37 2014 UTC,"Mozart is not dead, he is in Cuba.  I know because the mother fucker owes me twenty bucks."
Mozart,2nt14k,Markshlitz222,1 point,Sun Nov 30 21:07:57 2014 UTC,"I would guess that Mozart is probably dead. I guess if he was really healthy, he might be able to pull it off."
Mozart,2nt14k,Aaron51598,1 point,Mon Dec 1 00:50:38 2014 UTC,Yes.    He's pumping gas with Elvis in the Nevada desert just outside of Pahrump.
Mozart,2myr69,ermany,1 point,Fri Nov 21 07:19:16 2014 UTC,It seems you forgot to post a link!
Mozart,2myr69,SasoriDama,1 point,Sat Nov 22 16:33:00 2014 UTC,Quality is so bad that link doesn't exist. You have to use your imagination.   No seriously thanks for the reply. I posted the link
Mozart,2my1m7,wwstevens,2,Fri Nov 21 02:51:10 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I'm waiting on the Swafford. The man's a genius and goddamn do I hope he does Mozart."
Mozart,2my1m7,Wamoz56,1 point,Fri Nov 21 06:33:38 2014 UTC,"When you say the Swafford, who is that and to what work are you referring?"
Mozart,2my1m7,Wamoz56,3,Sat Nov 22 01:51:39 2014 UTC,"The musicologist Jan Swafford, whose Brahms and Beethoven biographies are the two best works of non-fiction I think I've ever read. I have no reason to believe that he's working on a Mozart (the 1,000 page Beethoven just came out like two months ago) but I sure hope he is.   Re: Mozart, there's the Solomon, but I'm not a huge fan of his; too much armchair speculation; not enough rhetorical flair. There's the Einstein, definitely a classic and a safe bet."
Mozart,2my1m7,SasoriDama,1 point,Sat Nov 22 07:33:21 2014 UTC,Awesome.  Thanks for the clarification and suggestions!
Mozart,2my1m7,Stink-Finger,2,Sat Nov 22 14:50:52 2014 UTC,"While it isn't exactly what you are asking and there is a chance you have already read it, it is worth bringing up the Franz Xaver Niemetschek's biography which isn't the best, but has some historical value being the first Mozart biography, and being a primary source. Also if you haven't read his letters those are a good read too and they come in a book collection."
Mozart,2jqu2r,CaliforniaPoppyCock,5,Mon Oct 20 01:43:28 2014 UTC,I'm just straight up angry about this. Can't believe that little shit had to go and die on us when he was only 35. How rude.
Mozart,2jqu2r,iggypopstesticle,6,Mon Oct 20 17:06:17 2014 UTC,"I definitely agree that it is disappointing that we will never see the mans face. Still, the fact that a photo will never exist plus his early and tragic death make a great mystery surrounding the man that will be heard forever but never seen.  If it makes you feel better this: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdsjxisveK1qfadvwo1_500.png is computer generated face based on portraits and descriptions."
Mozart,28kj1d,SasoriDama,2,Thu Jun 19 17:57:01 2014 UTC,This is great!!!!!!
