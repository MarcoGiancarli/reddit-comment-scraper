Seriously, play ANY online game and be on a losing team. Or even a winning team.  Men going after someone they know to be a woman is part of that mentality of going after whatever they can. Women in online games (especially in my experience, PC games, consoles seem to have more ladies playing) are not common, so going on about it is likely to get under their skin, like they don't belong or some such. It's just people trying to get a rise out of someone as easily as they can."

Never once have they tried to lend context to this number which should have never been released.  The ""red team"" are a group of experts that know the procedures and technical limitations inside and out and specifically target the known weak areas in order to develop better screening procedures and equipment.  That being said, if you really wanted to have foolproof security then it'll take 5 hours to get through the line at the airport.  They should just issue weapons to every passenger so that they can keep themselves safe.

NoShitSherlock,3b61nk,PetevonPete,-4,Fri Jun 26 23:47:56 2015 UTC,"So how should airport security be handled? People love to criticize the TSA, but it's rare to hear someone suggest what should actually change.   And believe me I would love nothing more than for change to happen. I fly a lot for my job, and there is a lot of racial profiling. But with a 95% failure rate, is less thorough security the right option? Food for thought."
NoShitSherlock,3b61nk,Pancakewagon26,8,Fri Jun 26 14:10:52 2015 UTC,"Sure I can take a stab at that. Firstly, we have to look at cost/benefit. Right now terrorism is one of the least likely ways for a person to die. On the other hand the TSA's budget is north of 7 Billion a year. What other things could we spend money on that would reduce death and increase life expectancy? My guess is a lot, most of them would be unsexy and unglamorous (like increasing spending on healthy lunches for students or healthcare), but would have more tangible results.  But let's say we want to spend the 7 bills on TSA, how would we improve performance?   1) Use more sampling-less universal searches. Look, from any scientific and statistical standpoint searching every bag and every person is both wasteful and pointless. Time and again it's been shown that a random sampling of people's being searched leads to a better result. 1 out of every 20 people generally is enough to ensure the entire group follows the rules. Additionally, by not having everyone go through the same process it makes it hard for terrorists to train. Right now, a potential terrorist can do dummy runs on the system to see what can be gotten through the security and what can't. Because the security measures taken against him/her will be roughly the same every time they're able to know that if an object can slip through once it'll probably slip through every time.  Assuming now that only 1 out of every 20 people go through full security what's the outcome? Well a lot less frontline TSA agents for one. Now those savings can now be used for other things. Like what? Well massively increasing the training and quality of current agents. Start to migrate away from TSA employing those that  failed to become either a police officer or a prison guard more towards becoming an elite branch of government anti-terrorism interdiction.  2) Hire more sky marshals. Again sticking with the theme less money on searches mean more money for other things means more plainclothes security, both on flights and off. The reality is a having marshalls pop up on a flight is a very effective deterrent.   3) Radically change the role of the flight attendant. The stewardess was invented because business men in the 50's liked it when pretty girls got them coffee. That role is now completely anachronistic and frankly should be retired. What it should be replaced with a the role of an air attendant who's part cop, part medic and will occasionally get you a snack. But the reality is that if the attendants were trained primarily like a small town first responder, and secondarily as a coffee wench... well doubtful anyone would start shit on a plane.  4) This one's weird. but it should be talked about. The reality is the best defence against terrorism is the fact that everyone else on a plane doesn't want to die. Travellers today are very aware of the risks of terrorism and anyone acting strange or suspicious on a flight will be contained. You just have to look at how many times someone being rowdy on a plane gets restrained by fellow passengers to see how effective fellow passengers can be.  So... TL:DR, less bag checking and more 'quiet' support with enhanced training where it's understood that everyone on the ground and in the air is part of the solution, not the problem."

NoShitSherlock,3at6h6,serioussham,2,Tue Jun 23 14:34:52 2015 UTC,In Illinois you are required to get a FOID card in order to purchase either a firearm or ammo. 24 hour wait period for rifles and shotguns and 72 hour wait period for handguns.

NoShitSherlock,3at6h6,planeteclipse1,2,Tue Jun 23 17:12:09 2015 UTC,"And that seems to be doing great for Illinois. It can't be a coincidence that the places in the US with the most gun control (Chicago, Washington DC, Massachusetts etc) have the highest rates of gun violence. I agree something should be done to keep criminals and mentally unstable people from getting guns, but if they are willing to commit a crime involving shooting dozens of civilians, I feel they won't be scared of illegally buying a firearm underground. All that tougher gun laws do is make it so those who plan to legally use a gun for self defense are unarmed. If you were a psychopath, would you shoot up a place with the possibility of armed civilians shooting back, or a place where there is no chance of any deadly response?"

Call your local police station or just walk right in and ask if they have any old guns in the evidence locker for sale.

NoShitSherlock,3aii7q,NothingCrazy,2,Sun Jun 21 14:18:16 2015 UTC,"Swimming pools kill more people in any given year. How many thousands dead are worth sacrificing for ""recreational purposes""?"
NoShitSherlock,3aii7q,TheBlackHive,0,Sun Jun 21 14:49:29 2015 UTC,"First: you're wrong. (Very, VERY wrong. Probably best not to get your 'facts' from pro-gun sites. They tend to be full of misinformation.) According to the CDC, ALL non-boating related drowning deaths, which includes swimming pools and just about any other way you can drown, total only 3.5k deaths per year, which is only a little more than a tenth of gun deaths in the same time interval.   Secondly: false equivalence. The primary purpose of a firearm is to kill. If a swimming pool that was designed in such a way that it's main function was to drown whoever got into it, but it also had secondary recreational uses, you can bet that pool would be banned as fast as legislatures could get the law passed."
NoShitSherlock,3aii7q,NothingCrazy,2,Sun Jun 21 16:03:03 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I actually don't know the numbers for drownings. That was just a stat I'd heard before from what I thought was a neutral source. I think it might've been for child deaths. If it's wrong, I retract that statement.  Even if the number's lower, though, I don't think it's false equivalence. You perceive a gun as a weapon. It is more closely a tool or a piece of sporting equipment UNLESS you consider animal life and human life equivalent.  The purpose of a gun (outside of those designed for military and police use) is not to kill people. Sport shooting is very popular, and hunting even more so.  Compare to a knife. A knife is not for stabbing people. It's for cutting things, opening boxes, cooking, etc. It's a tool. It works as a weapon, and some people even have one for that purpose, but (outside of those designed for military use) that's not what it's for.  Is simply being capable of causing harm a reason to ban people from owning a tool?  If so, we need to ban knives of all kinds for sure. Baseball bats and golf clubs can pretty easily be used to crack a skull open. Archery equipment is right out. Screwdrivers are great for stabbing people, so those need to go, along with ice picks. Tire irons, hammers, and crowbars need to go for similar reasons to the baseball bats. Also lots of household and agricultural chemicals need to go for various reasons. Cars? I would say that's probably false equivalence because almost nobody intentionally weaponizes a car, but they are damn dangerous.  To be clear on my views, I really don't think the average civilian should have access to full-automatic firearms because there's no reason for that, but handguns for sport shooting and rifles/shotguns for hunting are fine. Absolutely register them. Absolutely run background checks. Maybe disallow concealed carry for non-military non-police citizens.  I just don't think there's any reason I shouldn't be allowed to go hunting because some fucktard decided to shoot up a church (or whatever the most recent outrage is). It's punishing people who obey the rules for the actions of people who don't."

The purpose of a gun (outside of those designed for military and police use) is not to kill people.   If this were true, then a safer gun alternative would be more popular.  To relate it back to the swimming pool analogy, imagine someone created a swimming pool that eliminated 99% of drowning deaths without costing any more or causing any other major inconveniences. It would instantly dominate the pool market. All things being equal, people would flock to the pool that doesn't kill people.   Yet somehow, the majority target shooting enthusiasts aren't using much safer pellet rifles... Why not? A pellet rifle's function is fundamentally different than that of a gun. Pellet rifles are what you claim guns to be, primarily recreational. Why haven't they replaced guns for almost all target shooting? Because the purpose of a gun is to kill, and you aren't going to be killing anyone with a pellet rifle."
NoShitSherlock,3aii7q,NothingCrazy,3,Sun Jun 21 17:40:15 2015 UTC,"Know what else pisses me off?  There was a company a while ago that introduced a biometric lock for guns so that only the gun's owner could fire it. This is awesome for a number of reasons, as it would cut the number of accidents dramatically, and if a gun were stolen, it would become a useless brick.  The gun nuts hated the idea, and I still don't understand why. It was an awesome idea. There was basically no downside, except that you'd need to charge it or the gun wouldn't work."
NoShitSherlock,3aii7q,TheBlackHive,2,Sun Jun 21 17:59:56 2015 UTC,"That's actually a great question, and I do wonder about that. Only reasonable answer I could give you is that pellet guns have no recoil, and therefore require less skill to handle.  They also have much shorter ranges, meaning that long shot competitions wouldn't be possible.  So, if we're going for equivalency, they're really only the same as a .22 rifle (which has no recoil) at short range.  If you designed a pellet gun with the range of a conventional gun, I bet people in the sport shooting community would like it, but it still wouldn't require the same skill as anything with a recoil. Also, at that point, it would definitely be a very capable weapon for hurting people if you put it to that use."

This study does not account for all the instances where a firearm is used for self defense that does not end in a death.  Instances where brandishing a gun is enough to scare off an attacker, or where an attacker is shot but not killed.  This article lists the number of instances at around 67,700 per year.  That figure comes from a study done by the Violence Policy Center, a decidedly anti-gun organization, so it's a low estimate if anything.  It's a lot lower than the NRA's 2 million per year talking point, but even as a shooting sports enthusiast, I don't trust any of their statistics.  One has to wonder that, without those 67k (at least) defensive gun uses per year, how much higher would the gun homicide number be?  Probably higher than the 8k it is now.  Even if only five percent of those attacks thwarted by defensive use of a gun would have otherwise ended in a gun murder, that means the gun homicide rate would be over 40% higher without defensive gun use."

In America, for instance, 94% of terrorist attacks which have occurred since 1980 have been carried out by non-Muslims according to FBI figures. Washington Post  And Europol found that only about 2% of terrorist attacks in Europe between 2010-2014 were even religiously motivated. Metro.  So, I suppose it's still noteworthy that Muslims are associated with terrorism in people's minds, considering they're actually not in real life."

So the over representation problem doesn't just apply to Muslims.   I assume also, on a topic like terrorism, minority groups are likely to be overrepresented due to the inherent nature of terrorism. But that's just speculation.   I'll have to go and look at crime rates in Europe re Muslims. I'm European myself, and I hadn't heard of Muslims having a particularly bad rep re crime. Though, I wouldn't be surprised if they were overrepresented given they're generally from poorer backgrounds - at least, recent generations of immigrant Muslim families."

As for crime rates- France, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, and even the UK have over representation."
NoShitSherlock,3a22rs,MrGraeme,4,Tue Jun 16 19:33:07 2015 UTC,"It could also have something to do with the seemingly daily to weekly  car or suicide bombings in the middle east for the past decade that have been on the news in the US (and around the world).

NoShitSherlock,3a22rs,PigSlam,5,Tue Jun 16 20:31:12 2015 UTC,"Very true. It'll definitely affect public opinion. Though the YouGov poll in the article is actually for us over here in the UK. The point still of course applies.   I think the worrying thing is that the title is potentially somewhat misleading, as it could be construed as being ""muslims are more associated with terrorism than other groups"", when in fact the poll was asking people which word - of all possible words - they most associate with muslims. The answer was terrorism.  Which I can't help but feel is a much greater shame."
NoShitSherlock,3a22rs,not_a_morning_person,2,Tue Jun 16 21:30:43 2015 UTC,The answer was terrorism. Which I can't help but feel is a much greater shame.   Agreed.

NoShitSherlock,3a22rs,tommyncfc,2,Wed Jun 17 07:23:40 2015 UTC,The same Europol study shows that 82% of terrorist attacks or attempted terrorist attacks in Europe are committed by left wing political groups and only 18% by right wing (including religious) political groups.
NoShitSherlock,3a22rs,kastenbrust,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:47:31 2015 UTC,"if 1% of the population carries out 6% of a type of crime then that is a very serious problem in that community - Because the rate of criminality is far higher than the other 99% of the population, even though the rest of the population carried out 94% of similar crimes."
NoShitSherlock,3a22rs,greyfade,2,Tue Jun 16 22:51:31 2015 UTC,"So, I suppose it's still noteworthy that Muslims are associated with terrorism in people's minds, considering they're actually not in real life.   Except the vast majority of terrorist incidents worldwide are committed by, or are claimed by, Islamist or Jihadist Muslim groups. This list of incidents in 2015 is dominated almost completely by Muslim organizations and individuals, with only a few exceptions. Similarly, 2014 was also dominated by Jihadist terror groups.  That the number of incidents in the US were not committed by Muslims does not counter the point that the majority of these crimes worldwide are. In fact, the point that the majority of terrorist incidents in the US are committed by non-Muslims ignores the fact that the number of these incidents is, in total, relatively small, and compares favorably with the number of resident Muslims. By contrast, the majority of Jihadist attacks happen in countries that are fraught with economic and political instability and, more importantly, which have comparatively large populations of strongly religious individuals, especially where those individuals have theocratic views.  To clarify, where Jihadist Muslims are the majority compared to non-Islamist Muslims, these kinds of incidents happen. Where the Islamists are the minority (which is the case in Western nations like the US and most of Europe) among the Muslim population, these incidents are far less common.  (Note: I'm using the definition of Islamist being ""Muslims who support Sharia in their country of residence"" and Jihadist being ""Muslims who act on Sharia and the teachings of the Hadith."")"

NoShitSherlock,37tyjr,bunker_man,9,Sat May 30 10:57:04 2015 UTC,"The actual study suggests that attractiveness only matters when the man in question violates a social norm. As mentioned in the abstract:  ""Norm violation also presented significant results, while facial attractiveness alone did not.""  They aren't saying that women think less of unattractive men, they're saying that women only judge unattractive men more harshly when they're acting weird. This isn't a new discovery and it applies to both sexes. We naively trust pretty people more than ugly ones. It's why babies hate clowns and news reporters are all gorgeous.   While I suspect that the conclusions of the actual study (not the media reports of it) are accurate, this is just one study. It uses only university aged women, only two male faces, and only two scenarios. The researchers recognize all these limitations within their paper and I wouldn't be surprised if they were banging their heads on walls as a result of the shoddy media coverage this is getting. Here's the original study which is available in full for free (a nice change)."

NoShitSherlock,37ojap,nliausacmmv,10,Fri May 29 04:02:23 2015 UTC,"Republican legislators were happy to stand up against aid for Hurricane Sandy, but are quick to play the sympathy card when their state gets hit by weather. I can name Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz of the top of my head. The No Shit part comes in because this is an ongoing theme with Republicans on the far right, they want fiscal responsibility, until it benefits them. When it benefits them we are supposed to break the bank. It was a crap post, and it probably was put here for someone's political agenda, but when an article states the obvious, isn't that the point?"
NoShitSherlock,37ojap,sakonyachen,3,Fri May 29 04:47:21 2015 UTC,The overwhelming majority of republicans supported this bill and in fact it was written by and sponsored by a republican.
NoShitSherlock,37ojap,dgillz,2,Fri May 29 15:38:56 2015 UTC,"That's not obvious to everyone. It seems pretty bad when you put it that way, but you're also only seeing it and presenting it from one side.  The alternative argument is that Ted Cruz was actually against the Hurricane Sandy bill because it had a bunch of the funds tacked on as opportunistic ""pork barrel"" spending. He supported revisiting it without those additions. It's also possible he'd be against this bill passing to help his own state out if it had the same sort of opportunism going on.  I don't agree with that explanation 100%, but that's another way to look at it. However it's not obvious to everyone that Republicans ""are only for spending when it benefits their states"", as from their side they see it differently. That makes it obvious to only a subset of people and not everyone.  It should be ""obvious"" across political lines to be posted in /r/NoShitSherlock I think is the main idea/request of the OP."

Don't blame us for pointing out all the stupid things they say and do, that is the point of this sub.  Your first example doesn't fit here at all, the second example is a perfect fit.  It seems like you are the one pushing an agenda."
NoShitSherlock,37ojap,antisyzygy,1 point,Fri May 29 12:57:19 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Republicans see it very, very differently than you do. When you view it with limited information and a liberal POV of course it seems like they do stupid things. Usually when you dig deeper there is some justification that is more reasonable for what they do and say. That justification you may not agree with, but people are allowed to disagree on things and each citizen has different priorities.  In the case of the Hurricane Sandy bill I recall the Cruz said he didn't approve it because it had a bunch of opportunistic ""pork barrel"" spending attached to the bill, but he'd support a revised one. That may not be the truth, but it's a reasonable explanation that Republicans believe. It may actually not be true that they Cruz is going back on his word, maybe the bill to help out Texas doesn't have all the pork barrel opportunism attached. It takes more research than reading titles or editorialized articles on liberal websites to figure out their motives for doing things.  I'm liberal leaning so I'm not defending Republicans, I think their leadership sucks and they are doing the wrong things, but I'm just saying that it's not actually obvious that ""Republicans are only for spending when it benefits their own state"" to everyone. I personally think that since it takes research to find that out what their view of the issue is it's not really a ""No Shit Sherlock"" topic."
NoShitSherlock,37ojap,sakonyachen,1 point,Fri May 29 17:09:45 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Republicans see it very, very differently than you do.    It doesn't matter if they do. Or even if they are correct. I don't really care if the article's title is accurate, just wether or not what they are saying is not really worthy of an article because most people know that anyway, or at least believe it anyway. Basically any post that uses a group of more than a million people can't be correct because huge groups are not going to consist of a single opinion.   The reason this is happening more with republican missteps and stories about the popularity of liberal ideals is because republicans exalt themselves to levels that are their own detriment, and liberal ideals nowadays are really just disagreeing with the views that seem to go back to either deep pockets or religious authoritarianism. After watching right wing blow hards for years tell us we want to destroy the world for several decades, the left is getting mouthy about everything as well. It's not that complicated."
NoShitSherlock,37ojap,antisyzygy,1 point,Fri May 29 17:39:51 2015 UTC,"Again, you're showing a significant liberal POV there. That's the problem, it's not obvious that Republicans are doing the negative things you mentioned to around half the people out there. The last thing we need is another /r/politics circle jerk fest."
NoShitSherlock,37ojap,sakonyachen,1 point,Fri May 29 17:52:02 2015 UTC,"It's not a liberal point of view that republicans say more silly shit, or that middle of the road is now considered liberal. I may phrase it badly because I have a liberal bias, but it's true. I do agree that this sub bashes reps more than dems, but /r/politics is a serious sub,I only really like to go to /r/politics to pick arguments with people who have bad arguments, even when I agree sometimes. That sub is a joke now. This one is supposed to be. I guess that's really what I'm trying to say. But asking someone to think that something isn't obvious because people are in denial is unfair. In a democracy, you have to cater to those people as well, but in a sub that is sarcastic in the first place, you should be a smart ass. Even if the joke is factually incorrect. I tried to concede the fact that it was bullshit to you earlier, but I got sidetracked. The part that wasn't bullshit is that the same dude that fought against Sandy aid is now asking for aid. Is that textbook hypocrisy? Not if his reasons for blocking aid for the East Coast were legitimately all about pork. But, that would also mean he needs to fight every bill over spending not related to the core of the bill for that premise to excuse him. Which is close enough to true in Cruz's(is that the possessive of Cruz?) case. But to think that this doesn't fit the point of the sub is a bit extreme. It's a crap post, but it's not the death knell of the sub's validity. It's just a crap post, as many more will be.   I do have a liberal bias by all accounts, but if you check my history, I don't hate conservatives. Honestly, I am conservative in my personal life, and far left in my politics. I think we need conservatives to have a strong voice to check liberal ideas from running amok when they start to inflict harm, just as much as I believe liberals have become to complacent about the conservative push of the last forty years or so. But when you make a joke, you shouldn't have to give a fuck about whose feelings get hurt, unless you are being crude or way too personal. Shit, if the bias bothers you that much, find some right wing No Shit links and post them. Just try not to be so concerned with the political slant of a comical sub."

Don't get me wrong, was a great school. But I think the phone ban hurt way more than it helped.   The reason that grades were so good there was because of the entrance exams and screenings, not because the phones were gone. I feel like the lack of phones really amplified the social drama.   It also made it harder for the graduates to interact normally when they were released into high school (it only went up to 8th grade). Everyone in the school haven't learned how to healthily use their phones, craving every interaction on it.   The school's response to this problem was a cyber bullying curriculum, which mainly consisted of the tech teacher telling us ""Don't cyber bully, don't meet people online, and stay away from people who cyber bully you"".

You know what? Maybe it will continue to run for the next ten years. Or, vastly more likely, it will continue to 'run' while having to visit a mechanic every couple months, if not just outright die. Maybe it will get the job done. Or maybe it will leave you on the side of the road waiting for a tow truck.

I could care less what the general public thinks, because it's not their body and I'm not here to please them or follow every single one of their rules. Putting someone else first by helping someone find their way when they are lost is one thing, asking someone to literally change something about their body so that...what...they don't have to look at them? That is not only selfish of anyone to ask, that is also incredibly shallow. Not that you were insinuating as such, but I'm just saying that it's a lot more complicated than you make it out to be.  Being obese is undeniably unhealthy, but just like nobody in the world owes you anything, there is nothing that anyone struggling with obesity owes you either.

NoShitSherlock,34so08,rockos_modern_strife,6,Mon May 4 05:45:26 2015 UTC,I remember some telling me the opposite. Basically the conventional thinking was that MMA caused less damage because of the lower number of blows to the head.
NoShitSherlock,34so08,MrTossPot,2,Mon May 4 07:29:56 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that fewer blows doesn't necessarily mean less damage occurs, even over a given career. Yes, the risks can be additive with any injury to the head, and boxers may withstand more total blows to the head in a given career.   However, knockouts occur more often in MMA vs. Boxing and I'd assume those knockouts would have the greater potential for injury than any additive effect.   I found an article that compares the rates of knockouts among contact sports but the actual journal is not a free publication, so it'll have to do.   Either way, athletes take risks of long term complications with any amount of repeated contact."
NoShitSherlock,34so08,MrTossPot,1 point,Mon May 4 17:25:29 2015 UTC,I honestly think that number of knockouts doesn't necessarily make for more brain damage. The article states that in MMA people are hit like 5-10 times on average AFTER they're knocked out. That must fuck your brain up badly. Actually that was the thing that convinced me the article was probably correct.
NoShitSherlock,34so08,MrRogers4Life2,1 point,Mon May 4 20:14:50 2015 UTC,"After they're knocked out though.  In boxing do they count how many times people get hit after the first time they touch the floor.  Because in mma if you hit the floor once the fight is almost always called, while boxing you have 10 seconds to stand up over and over and over again. So to get a fair comparison count the number of times you get hit after the first knockdown"
NoShitSherlock,34so08,PetevonPete,1 point,Mon May 4 20:19:11 2015 UTC,"I remember some telling me the opposite.   Well, that certainly sounds ironclad."
NoShitSherlock,34so08,MrRogers4Life2,5,Thu May 7 16:06:59 2015 UTC,"According to this article (which literally gives no statistics about nor really talks about boxing that much) forgets to mention a few things.  First being that those ""small fingerless gloves"" actually encourage fighters to punch with less force than 16oz boxing gloves.  Yeah, fighters wear those for their own protection not to protect their opponents, at the first ufc there was a guy who wore one boxing glove so he can punch people without breaking his hand (look up art jimmerson).   Second this article talks a lot about traumatic head injuries, but those aren't the ones that gets every fighter scared or worried, it's actually the ones that happen over time.  Did you know that after you get your first concussion the next ones come easier, well they do, and the only thing that will help is recovery time.  If you go to a dinner held by a boxing organization, ask yourself if all those old veteran boxers are totally alright in the head, nope, even the ones that didn't get knocked out are probably affected by some kind of brain injury.    The reason people say boxing is worse than mma in regards to head trauma is not because of knockouts but because of mindset.  Pacquiao vs Mayweather was 12 3 minute rounds, that's 36 minutes of 2 men who are very very good at punching people in a ring for 36 minutes hitting each other.  That's more than twice as long as a ufc championship bout.  And if they get knocked down once, they have 10 freaking seconds to get up, 10 seconds is a lot of time to stand up, especially if you could use the ropes, which you can.  Boxers also fight a lot more than mma fighters.  Amongst the current ufc champions, only one or two break 30 professional fights. Mayweather has 48, and that's not that crazy for a boxer.    But the main reason that I feel mma is safer than boxing is really just the mindset.  Even if boxing was less likely to get you traumatic brain injuries, ufc has done more to prevent and treat concussions than any other organization involved in managing contact sports.  For example UFC has a minimum 3 months between fights if you've been knocked out, and you can't do contact training for 60 days.  As well as being unable to return without a doctors approval.  You just don't see this kind of policy or awareness in boxing or even ""safer"" contact sports like football.  Tldr; this article doesn't exactly paint a thorough picture of all the factors that surround the issue of brain trauma in contact sports"

Probably waaaay lower than USA and many other countries still."
NoShitSherlock,34sqmv,okalyddude,8,Sat May 9 11:00:26 2015 UTC,"Strong gun laws are not equivalent to taking guns away from citizens. To the contrary, they consist of transparent rules and procedures designed to manage the possession, storage and carrying of firearms in order to limit access to legitimate users alone.   Here's why this is bullshit:  I live in NJ.  The gun laws here are arguably stricter than anywhere else in the US.  They're stricter than Canada and some European countries.  At no point in the foreseeable future could NJ's laws be enacted in much of the country without starting a civil war.  In other words, we already have gun laws that are stricter than are logistically feasible for the rest of the country.  And we still have a shit-ton of violent gun-crime.  There is a lengthy process to get a FID card (what you need to purchase any long gun) involving a criminal background check, mental health check, digital fingerprinting, and interviews with your friends, family, and employer.  Each and every handgun also requires a separate permit involving a background check and must be applied for individually.  This is in addition to the federal background check done at the time of purchase.  You are limited to one handgun every 30 days, and there is a whole list of banned guns and banned features which you can't own at all.  The whole process can take anywhere from 2 to 10 months and involves a couple hundred bucks worth of fees.  I list all the hoops we have to jump through to illustrate that in NJ, anybody who legally possesses a gun is incredibly unlikely to be a threat.  The process scares away plenty of non-criminals.  Actual criminals certainly won't make it through.  Legal gun ownership in NJ is 12% - second lowest in the country, just above Hawaii.    And yet our gun crime statistics are smack in the middle of the pack.  We have more gun murders per 100k people than gun-friendly states like Kentucky and Ohio.  Virtually all of those murders are carried out using illegally acquired guns.  You could outright ban legal gun ownership in NJ, and our gun crime numbers wouldn't move an inch because the people who comply with gun laws and the people committing the crimes are not the same people.  But don't take NJ's word for it.  Look at Washington DC.  It has more than twice as many gun murders per 100k residents as any state, yet has the lowest percentage of legal gun ownership at 3.6%.  It has been nearly impossible to legally purchase a gun in the district for several years.  Nobody can legally carry in DC unless they're on some congressman's security detail - and yet their gun crime is at near-Somalian levels.    Obviously making it harder to legally purchase guns doesn't prevent gun crime.  The sort of folks who are willing to disregard laws like ""don't shoot people"" aren't going to give two tugs of a dead dog's dick about laws like ""don't buy guns unless we give you permission"".  It's like trying to cut down on meth lab explosions by enacting stricter OSHA requirements.  You're trying to stop people from breaking the law by making more laws.  It's patently absurd.  With over 300 million guns in circulation, disarming America is logistically impossible.  No matter how hard you make it to purchase guns legally, illegal guns will always be cheap and plentiful.  If you want to reduce gun violence, you need to fix the underlying causes - poverty, institutionalized wealth disparity, and non-existent mental health support."
NoShitSherlock,34sqmv,candre23,-3,Mon May 4 13:51:05 2015 UTC,"The problem is that local laws can't combat this sort of thing.  As long as you can go on gunbroker and arrange delivery, or just drive to a more gun friendly state, then gun control is doomed to failure.  Something like nj style laws, on a national level, could, after a few years, have a noticeable impact."
NoShitSherlock,34sqmv,therealbighairy,6,Mon May 4 15:49:43 2015 UTC,"As long as you can go on gunbroker and arrange delivery, or just drive to a more gun friendly state   You make it sound so easy, like anybody can do this.  You're right - anybody can.  But they're looking at 3+ years in prison if they get caught.  The laws here are no fucking joke.  People get chewed up by the system all the time.  Seriously, all the damn time.  Again, there are more than 300 million guns in America.  Practically none of them are ""registered"" in any meaningful way.  We don't know where they are or who has them.  If you drive the gun trade underground with national restrictions, that trade will be well supplied for several decades, at least.  Up until a couple years ago, weed was illegal everywhere in the US.  And anybody could get weed without too much hassle.  It's both valuable and ubiquitous, so anybody willing to risk the wrath of the law could get some if they wanted to.  Guns would be the same.  Criminals who aren't afraid of going to prison for armed robbery or murder aren't going to pause because they might go to jail for possession.  Most of these criminals already aren't allowed to have guns, even in gun-friendly states.  If the US became a gun-free zone today, they wouldn't have any more difficulty acquiring guns than they do now.  The only people you'd take guns away from are people who obey the law - people whom, by definition, are not the problem."
NoShitSherlock,34sqmv,candre23,-2,Mon May 4 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"It's a war of attrition, though.  In time, as more crooks are caught with guns, there will be less guns available to them.  It seems insurmountable, especially when it is tackled piecemeal, instead of nationwide."

It goes in to significant detail as to why this is impossible.  You'd start a civil war.  Before you claim I'm being hyperbolic, please remember that the governor of Texas just deployed the state guard because he is concerned that Obama is about to put Texas under martial law and ship its citizens to FEMA concentration camps.  The majority of the country prefers gun rights to gun restriction.  A portion of law enforcement and army personnel have already pledged not to enforce gun confiscation laws.  Between rampant police brutality and NSA spying and out-of-control civil forfeiture, nobody trusts ""the government"" right now.  If ""the government"" came for everybody's guns, a lot of those folks would hand them over to ""the government"" one bullet at a time.  I don't agree with that mentality.  It's not reasonable or rational, but it's true.  And it has to be considered as a virtually-guaranteed response to any federal gun-grab.  Sure, they'd lose... eventually.  But there would be Waco-level standoffs on a weekly basis for decades, at the very least.  Some states (Texas, certainly) would attempt to secede.  It would be Bad."

NoShitSherlock,34sqmv,therealbighairy,3,Mon May 4 20:40:44 2015 UTC,"I think the above commenter pretty much hit the nail on the head, if we do that guns would be the next weed. Very few people would follow the rules, and you'd essentially create a culture of disregarding the law in a large demographic of people who very strictly follow it. Not to mention, it's not difficult to make guns. People do it all the time, hell, all illegalizing would do is drive gun prices up further, and create more of an incentive for criminal organizations to produce amateur gun factories. It'd be the next prohibition!  And as I mentioned, your argument doesn't hold much weight considering how easy guns are to produce. We need to target crime and poverty, and yeah that's difficult, but banning guns isn't going to solve any issues, just make dumb people feel better about themselves well ignoring dangerous social problems and refusal to help communities that actually need it.   Oh, and let me toss in another! It's in our bill of rights ffs, our army has taken an oath to defend our constitution, so you'd need to pass a constitutional amendment to get that through. And granted you somehow do, the legality of that amendment would be incredibly iffy, this is the same part of our law that guarantees freedom of religion and speech. So granted you even try, it'd likely be grounds for civil war."

NoShitSherlock,34a839,nliausacmmv,4,Thu Apr 30 21:09:48 2015 UTC,"I'm treading lightly here because I really don't know the answers to the GMO dilemma.    I was a biology major and taught biology for 15 years.  I'm no expert nor do I claim to be when it comes to GMO's.  What I do know and this comes from basic genetic and biological principles is that every living organism has a set of instructions or code (DNA) that for the most part is in relative harmony with its environment.  One concept that most 10th graders understand is that the strongest survive and the weak die off.  So the best set of instructions or DNA tends to survive and the weakest or least useful tend to die off.  As we began to understand DNA and how specific genes can affect an organism we also began to alter certain genes and found that in certain circumstances modifying that code can be a good thing.  Problem with the GMO debate at its present fever pitch is that it has become emotional.    Before I go further it is essential to note that science has been wrong many, many times.  At best science represents the best of what we know now.  There is still so much more to discover.  Back to the emotional debate.  For many who support GMO's they routinely site ""science"" and the foolproof studies that state there is no danger.  For those opposed to GMO's they claim or believe that there is an inherent danger in ingesting an organism that has been altered.  So let's take a look at the idea that our bodies, specifically our digestive system has evolved over time and in relation and relative harmony to the food we ingest.  As food changes or evolves so too does our bodies to keep up or in tune with the food.  The big question and concern is that we really don't know the long term affects of GMO's at this time.  I'm not saying that they are bad, nor am I saying that they are good.  What is clear is that if you look at the biggest food allergies (https://farrp.unl.edu/informallbig8 ) many of these foods are ""new"" to human consumption.  That may or may not suggest that our human digestive tract has or has not caught up with the introduction of these foods.  Take milk for example.  Humans have only been drinking milk for 7500 years ( http://phys.org/news170657572.html ).  So what changed?  Humans in dairy farming communities evolved to digest milk, more or less.  7500 years later many humans still get sick if they drink milk.  At this point in time, no one knows how GMO's will effect humans in the long run.  We know that 7500 years is not enough time for humans to catch up with mild consumption.  Again, I am not saying that you should not eat GMO's, I'm only pointing out that there still are some unknowns.  Clearly there are huge financial incentives for companies to produce GM foods.  And for good reason.  There were only about 3 billion people on the earth in 1960.  Today we are over 7 billion.  A better strain of grain that is drought resistant may be a good idea.  Back to the milk dilemma.  If we accelerate the natural selection of food traits by modifying them, basic scientific process would theorize that this would or may disrupt the human's ability to adapt as quickly.  We are 7500 years into milk consumption and milk is one of the most common food allergies.  It is mandatory to label any food product that has milk because it could be dangerous.  Yet, GMO supporters are so quick to label anyone cautious about GMO's as crazy, demented fools.  So let me say this.  I don't care if my food is GMO.  I'm not allergic to any foods.  My genetic code and my ancestors adapted to the new foods.  However my daughter is very allergic to milk and we as a family must be careful about what we consume.  So my question is this.  Since we really can't see 7500 years into the future, Why is there so much opposition to simply labeling any food that has been modified?"
NoShitSherlock,34a839,Stone_One,-1,Thu Apr 30 22:07:00 2015 UTC,"Since we really can't see 7500 years into the future, Why is there so much opposition to simply labeling any food that has been modified?   You can say this about anything people do.  Such a irrational and incorrect use of the precautionary principle completely discredits your concerns.    But since you mentioned labeling....   Labeling is an attempt to ban GM products, it is not to educate. Many anti-GMO activists state this explicitly.  http://files.vkk.me/images/44218639cd7ad0c686050a38c3913bed2c7caf3a.png The decades old scientific consensus is that there is no difference in health or safety between GM and non-GM crops.  http://i.imgur.com/Dj0MLX1.jpg 'Non-GMO' and 'USDA Organic' labels already exist.   There is no compelling reason to mandate a 'life-style label'.  Consider religious groups mandating all non-halal or non-kosher foods be labeled instead of the other way around. Given there is no compelling scientific reason for a mandatory label, such laws run afoul (ironically) of free speech.  This is the primary reason the law will be struck down in court.   Labeling laws (as stated so far) would cause serious logistical issues, because it would require completely separate handling and storage of different varietals, a chain of custody would be required from farmer to processing plant.  A state passing such a law would be in effect legislating across state boundaries and be struck down under the commerce clause.  This is a secondary reason the law it will be struck down in court. Adding to the expense of food with no compelling reason is dumb. There is no well defined definition of what constitutes a GMO.  Everything from artificial selection to transgentics are genetically modified in one sense and only activists seem to confuse Genetically Engineered with Genetically modified.  This is another reason the law will be struck down in court.   Most GM crops are animal feed or are processed to the point that there is nothing ""GM"" about the product.  Maybe you can point to the ""GM"" part of a sugar molecule.  How can such a thing be meaningfully labeled or enforced?  This is another reason the law will be struck down in court."

His arguments are copy and paste and he's way too fast to respond with rote numerical marketing type blasts.  It smacks of professional marketing.  Almost all his responses use the most current marketing research techniques and none of his responses allow for any discussion.  Confirmation bias and a lack of dialogue and cherry picking lines and quotes from other posts used out of context, again are signs of professional marketing strategies.  Much the same drug companies and corporate backed research has a rich history of slanting the data to favor the product or profit.  http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/lies-damned-lies-and-medical-science/308269/ Adams main argument is for us to provide the data.  We/I can't and I will never be able to afford multi million dollar research projects.  This is the pinnacle of professional marketing tactics.  Scientology, big pharma and other organizations uses tactics like this to silence any dissenting voice.    More importantly Adam is working very hard to silence our questions and if he was really that concerned about the labeling process then he would back more research.  Also his history states that he is a teacher and I have never seen any competent teacher disregard an opposing view so vehemently.  The strategy is to push hard, overwhelm with information and disregard any alternate view.  One thing for sure is that Adam did not read any of my posts.  Confirmation bias had him reading to find a wedge, not answers and certainly not dialogue.  In the end I still find no reason scientifically at this point in time to not ingest GM food.  However I want the choice and I want my food labeled and when I see Adams of the world bulling any dissenting voice it makes me eager to push for labeling.  Labeling GM food will only affect Adam if he is paid by the GM food companies.  If he is not compensated by GM food money then he should not care about labeling our food."

Carcinogenicity of tetrachlorvinphos, parathion, malathion, diazinon, and glyphosate   There was limited evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of glyphosate.  Case-control studies of occupational exposure in the USA,(14) Canada,(6) and Sweden (7) reported increased risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma that persisted after adjustment for other pesticides.The AHS cohort did not show a significantly increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.   In male CD-1 mice, glyphosate induced a positive trend in the incidence of a rare tumour, renal tubule carcinoma. A second study reported a positive trend for haemangiosarcoma in male mice. (15) Glyphosate increased pancreatic islet-cell adenoma in male rats in two studies. A glyphosate formulation promoted skin tumours in an initiation-promotion study in mice.  ...One study reported increases in blood markers of chromosomal damage (micronuclei) in residents of several communities after spraying of glyphosate formulations. (16) Bacterial mutagenesis tests were negative. Glyphosate, glyphosate formulations, and AMPA induced oxidative stress in rodents and in vitro.   The Working Group classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2A).   Group 2a means: there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals and strong evidence (in vitro study) that the carcinogenesis is mediated by a mechanism that also operates in humans.   So basically, they don't have good evidence that it is carcinogenic in humans, but they they can find some evidence in rats.  (I didn't see a Seralini reference but I haven't searched the second level of citations).  They know that glyphosate can do some damage in vitro studies (duh just about anything would)."

People share a lot of chemical similarities with plants though, and I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow they found an enzyme in humans that reacts to glyphosate.

But, I don't think it's fair to say that the person you replied to is ""rejecting science for ideological reasons."" It's true that when it functions correctly, science is an invaluable, impartial, indispensable tool.  At the same time though, it is important to pay attention to who is doing a study or where the funding is coming from. In a perfect world, science is perfect - but at the end of the day, the process can be corrupted.   It should be self-regulating and self-correcting enough to resist this, and maybe it is. Then again, the other person said it was ""an issue of trust"" and they ""might be paranoid."" So not like they're firmly taking the stance that studies have been bought. They're just distrustful of a very powerful, very influential entity which could in theory misuse that power.  Again, I'm not against GMOs, but it's not as if it's completely unheard of for peer-reviewed science to be corrupted sometimes. Another example are all those lovely ""hey tobacco is harmless isn't THAT bad!"" studies that just happen to be funded by companies like Philip Morris.  Again, I'm not spouting conspiracy theory nonsense here, because I'm not saying there is a conspiracy. I'm just saying that it's not automatically ""anti-science"" for someone to be cautious.

People who reject (or even accept) the scientific consensus for the wrong reasons are in the position of reject not the given topic of consideration but the fundamental core of what makes science    A person who 'believes in' climate change for political and ideological reason is really no more following science than the creationists who denies evolution for political and ideological reasons.  It doesn't matter if one of their beliefs happens to correspond to the scientific consensus and one doesn't.    Second, you claim ""No one really knows the effects of GMOs."" is completely false and betrays a basic lack on knowledge on the subject.     Genetic Modification is a process not a product.   We certainly can know the effect of a given genetic modification.  That is the whole point of actually doing them, we can predict and control the changes, if we couldn't then the field wouldn't even exist.  Basically you are making an argument from ignorance. If you apply the same standard you outlined in your post to the rest of life we would be still living in the trees.    to profess that they are safe at this time is the equivalent to accepting the science of the 50's at it related to smoking.   False analogy.  The anti-GMO movement is much closer to the tobacco lobby in this case.  They are the ones who have to manufacture evidence.

NoShitSherlock,34a839,adamwho,13,Thu Apr 30 08:54:04 2015 UTC,"Lets take a look at your reasoning   GMO's are bad because of laws and politics. In a lot of cases GMO's have patents and you are not allowed to to recoup your seeds to plant again so instead you have to buy seeds from the supplier instead.   Your reasoning is at least 50 years out of date and has nothing to do specifically with GM crops.   Seed saving started to stop in the 1930s (long before GMOs) when hybrid crops were introduced; hybrids don't breed true. Seeds have been patented also since the 1930s, see plant patent act of 1930. Most commercial grade seeds are patented, this is not unique to GM crops. Seed saving is expensive and it is less cost effective and gives less reliable results.    Another problem with GMO's is that it contaminates organic fields and if they want to take the seeds out they will get sued on the premise that it might contain copyrighted material.   This is not an issue for several reasons.   There simply are not that many varietals of GM crops, the main ones being field corn and soy.  GM crops dominate these crops so the risk of contamination is almost non-existent because there are no other non-GM crops to contaminate. Pollination distances are well understood in commercial crops and framers already have a set-back if there is a possibility of contamination. Why is contamination an issue in the first place?  All the crops are harvested and used not replanted. If there is a case of legitimate contamination the companies that supplied the seeds (such as Monsanto) are willing to clean it up for free and compensate the farmer. There has NEVER been a case of one of the big Ag companies suing for accidental contamination.  Every single case has been about the farmer trying to steal patented seeds or trying to circumvent intellectual property.    GMO has a lot of problems, there are many reasons why countries in europe and asia absolutely refuse to deal with import GMO's. None of them have anything to do with eating it.    Science has nothing to do with why Europe blocks (some) GM crops; it is trade protectionism and pandering to a public ignorant of the science. The scientific consensus is there is no difference in health or safety between GM and non-GM crops. The scientific bodies of European countries and the EU have done their own independent studies and came to the some conclusion.     You have based your beliefs on some basic misinformation.  If you want citations for anything I said, then let me know."

I would say it is more like showing up wearing standard business attire instead of something creative.  Times New Roman isn't Wingdings.  It is still a legible font that isn't grossly unprofessional in the same way that sweatpants are.    I will agree that using the default font means you spent no time thinking about font selection, and I agree that there are HR people who will put a lot of stock into that.  I just don't agree that they should read too deeply into using a specific font."

NoShitSherlock,348gum,thefran,2,Wed Apr 29 21:18:36 2015 UTC,"1) changing font can change your spacing and resume layout, so depending on the font you switch to it can take longer than 10 seconds.  2)  The amount of time it takes has nothing to do with what I was saying.  The point I was trying to make is that sweatpants and a t-shirt are unprofessional.  Times New Roman is not unprofessional.  You can claim it is unimaginative to use it, and you would have a point that the person writing the resume probably assumed you cared more about what was written than what font it was written in and so they didn't think about it.  That doesn't mean that Times New Roman is as unprofessional as sweatpants and a t-shirt."
NoShitSherlock,348gum,oneineightbillion,-1,Wed Apr 29 22:16:05 2015 UTC,"It's not that sweatpants and a t-shirt is unprofessional, it's that the business suit is professional, whereas sweatpants indicate that you've put zero thought into getting ready for an interview.

Applying our theory to parents and children, this means that a parent does not have the right to aggress against his children, but also that the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights. The parent therefore may not murder or mutilate his child, and the law properly outlaws a parent from doing so.

(1b) How many of those who attempt to hijack a flight will be drunk college students? (2) How many people will decide to NOT FLY during that month?

Neither group will be told which is which - one group will be randomly selected as a true ""security theatre"", where both groups think they have a chance of being in this group.

The UK is also first past the post, and they traditionally have just two strong parties. The relative success of the Lib Dems seems more recent.   And while I have no solid basis for this thought, my guess is that both the GOP and the Dems prefer things the way they are and work to maintain that the arrangement.  edit: I'm not here to argue which one of these is better than the other.   There are pros and cons of each, and obviously both methods fail when compared to a totalitarian dictatorship.

The problem with FPTP is that it rewards strategic voting; if you vote for whoever you like best, you're likely to get a worse outcome than if you try to pick someone more electable.  This could be an advantage in some ways.  In theory, by forcing people to hold their noses and vote for someone electable, you get more moderate views in the legislature, which makes it easier for the legislators to come to agreement among themselves.

Because third parties are never allowed into the debates, they do not have the same opportunity to address people on a national level and share their message.

Same goes for religion I suspect."
NoShitSherlock,2x02ie,Greyhaven7,5,Wed Feb 25 01:16:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely. The Facebook approach, and search engines that refine searches based on history, are particularly insidious in how they quietly move a person in to their own personal echo chamber. What is socially acceptable is guided is based on observations of others, and this gold fish bowl approach can easily send someone down the wrong road. The problem is, it's giving people exactly what they want. It's difficult to be with people very different to ourselves and to have conversations that challenge our ways of viewing the world. It's far more pleasant to be in an environment where we get to be part of the consensus without being challenged. These conspiracy minded people were fed exactly what they wanted to see. I'm yet to meet a conspiracy theorist or an alternative medicine enthusiast who subscribes to just one aspect of these fields. More likely acceptance of one thing leads to an every expanding list of things that are often mutually contradictory, but accepted because they are individually compatible with the overarching belief that we are being deceived by government, big pharma, and the jews.

Specifically by:  may not block lawful content, applications, or services, subject to reasonable network management;  may not prohibit the use of non-harmful devices, subject to reasonable network management;  may not throttle lawful traffic by selectively slowing, speeding, degrading, or enhancing Internet traffic based on source, destination, or content, subject to reasonable network management;  may not engage in paid prioritization; and shall publicly disclose accurate and relevant information in plain language regarding the network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of its broadband Internet access services sufficient for consumers to make informed choices regarding use of such services and for content, application, service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings, except that a provider is not required to publicly disclose competitively sensitive information or information that could compromise network security or undermine the efficacy of reasonable network management practices."

Your own NY Times link states, ""In the intervening weeks, politics on the so-called net neutrality issue have shifted so much that House and Senate Republicans are circulating legislation that would ostensibly do exactly what the president wants: ban the blocking or “throttling” of web traffic and prohibit the creation of paid “fast lanes” for Internet content providers willing to pay for faster delivery.""

Democrats and Obama are backing the Title II, or so it seems, which would give the FCC heavy oversight on the industry.  Keep in mind, one of the main reasons these companies have been allowed to become quasi-monopolies is because government has regulated competition out of the marketplace.

NoShitSherlock,2u4p4q,Shotgun_Sentinel,2,Sat Jan 31 06:16:33 2015 UTC,The research is available.  But none of that is relevant. The fact that guns make suicide easier is incontrovertible.

Using exclusionary research is just bad because it is bad science. Even still the point isn't too make suicide harder, but less frequent. Gun control has obviously failed to do that in the examples I have mentioned."
NoShitSherlock,2u4p4q,Shotgun_Sentinel,1 point,Sat Jan 31 21:00:00 2015 UTC,"Well you're conflating to bodies of work that are independent.   It is not bad science, it is the the science that the top psychological journals and the science that NEJM uses. If you think it's bad science you better have some peer review research from trusted sources to back it up.   It's a funny topic to me. People who don't want guns to be dangerous are always changing the goal posts. It doesn't pass the common sense test, as they are a tool explicitly designed to kill (and in some cases explicitly to kill humans). It doesn't pass the statistical analysis test, when comparing gun deaths between largely similar economies and countries. It doesn't pass the historical test when countries pass more strict gun control they see a reduction in gun crime. And it certainly doesn't pass the suicide test, which is where this all started. The research is consistent. More guns=more deaths.  All I ever hear from the pro-gun lobby is a constantly changing field of why 'this' experiment was flawed or 'that' data is wrong. So another experiment is run and more data is collected and, shock and surprise, pro-gun hypothesis loses again, but oh the attacks pick at the science and the source and process again and again. I've seen this same tactic with global warming, evolution, nicotine and gun control.  I would respect those that debate this issue more if there was some authenticity. Just say it, I like guns and the fact that more people die because I like guns is ok by me. At least then we can have an authentic debate on what is a reasonable societal risk as opposed to this silliness."
NoShitSherlock,2u4p4q,actuallychrisgillen,2,Sat Jan 31 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"NEJM uses.   They are very bias against gun ownership, and always have been. This just proves that just because a group says they like it doesn't mean its good science. I and many others can use our brains and read the studies quoted, and realize that the science is bad because it excludes important variables and examples. I don't need a peer reviewed study to say those studies are bad, because I can use reason and logic myself.   It's a funny topic to me. People who don't want guns to be dangerous are always changing the goal posts. It doesn't pass the common sense test, as they are a tool explicitly designed to kill (and in some cases explicitly to kill humans).    No one is moving the goal posts, and no one is saying that guns can't be dangerous. The reality of the matter is that by in large guns are not a danger to their owners or other people. You can also have danger with less guns present, as proven by the numerous examples of nations with higher suicide rates and homicide rates than the US. That is one thing your ""common sense"" can't seem to grasp.   It doesn't pass the statistical analysis test, when comparing gun deaths between largely similar economies and countries.    Actually it does, because Germany, France, and Switzerland are all safer than the UK. Also if you have to use similar economies(the US is not similar to Europe anyway) you are already admitting that the correlation follows along that variable, and not whether a country has guns or not.   It doesn't pass the historical test when countries pass more strict gun control they see a reduction in gun crime.   There you go using exclusionary and loaded language. When talking about safety, you have to include all of the dangers. Many of those countries did not see immediate or strong drops in their total crime and violence rates, if anything they rose.    And it certainly doesn't pass the suicide test, which is where this all started. The research is consistent. More guns=more deaths.   That's only true if you ignore examples that go against this notion like Japan, the UK, Russia, and France. When you look at every country on Earth you will see that the country with the most guns(the US) is not the most dangerous place from homicide or suicide. You need a lot of asterisks to make that comment true.   All I ever hear from the pro-gun lobby is a constantly changing field of why 'this' experiment was flawed or 'that' data is wrong. So another experiment is run and more data is collected and, shock and surprise, pro-gun hypothesis loses again, but oh the attacks pick at the science and the source and process again and again.   There are many studies that go against your line of thinking, you have just ignored them as usual.  http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/03/new-study-finds-firearms-laws-do-nothing-to-prevent-homicides.php  http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba324  It is you who ignores the science you don't like, while clinging to bad biased science that just so happens to agree with the people who funded it. Those people being the gun control lobby. I also don't need science to look at raw data and see that there are numerous examples of high gun control low gun ownership nations that are also more dangerous than America when it comes to both suicide and homicide.   I would respect those that debate this issue more if there was some authenticity. Just say it, I like guns and the fact that more people die because I like guns is ok by me.   No I am not going to say that because it isn't true. More people die because desperate and/or crazy people get violent. That's the root cause that should be addressed here.   At least then we can have an authentic debate on what is a reasonable societal risk as opposed to this silliness.   There is no reasonable risk, because the entire debate around defending life is an emotional one. It comes down to which side is emotional about what. My side at least acknowledges that with liberty people can choose to keep themselves a live instead of just playing the odds. These odds are not determined by the level of gun control or gun ownership, but instead by the level of social and economic development."

My dad, who's a practicing Catholic as well as a scientist, doesn't believe it should touch science in anyway. Philosophy is all it is. We don't teach mythology in the classroom. We also don't teach any other religion because it deviates from the point of science. Take a religion class for goodness' sake."

A book written thousands of years ago with no current ability to test or reference any type of foundation using the scientific method is sooo beyond ridiculous.

It barely qualifies as a hypothesis.  It isn't based on any scientific data, doesn't make any testable predictions, and all but the most wishy-washy forms of it are in direct contradiction to the genetic, fossil, and observable evidence.  It's not scientific, and doesn't belong in a science classroom."

Original article claim ""Creationism isn't a science""  Your rebuttal: ""I find that the vast majority of the time I hear someone arguing for ""science,"" that science is not the issue at all, but rather materialism and secularism.""  My rebuttal to that: ""Maybe that's true sometimes but not in this case. Creationism literally is not a science for X reasons""  Your reply: ""That has nothing to do with my statement.""  ...  ...  Nope, I'm still lost. Maybe you could explain what exactly you mean? Since no matter how I look at it, my reply has everything to do with your statement."

NoShitSherlock,2tubiy,stillbatting1000,3,Wed Jan 28 03:00:42 2015 UTC,"Not nearly as often in my experience, but there's plenty of assholes out there so it does happen.  Just an FYI though: Darwinist is a strawman term. It fell out of usage after the 19th century once we learned more about biology. Darwin may have been the first one to put together the idea of evolution via natural selection, but his knowledge on the subject was miniscule when compared to what we know now.  It was replaced for a time by the term neo-darwinism, to imply that difference. But even that largely vanished by the 1930's.  The term Darwinism was revived in recent years by creationists trying to equate belief in the theory of evolution to religious belief. Ironic really since they claim belief in evolution is weak because it's faith based, then will turn around and say that belief in creationism is strong for exactly the same reason."
NoShitSherlock,2tubiy,blacksheep998,-9,Wed Jan 28 03:13:03 2015 UTC,That doesn't make it wrong. It just means that science lacks the ability to ascertain one way or the other.

NoShitSherlock,2tu8pd,ravenouscraving,2,Tue Jan 27 17:10:21 2015 UTC,"United States presidential election, 2012:       The United States presidential election of 2012 was the 57th quadrennial presidential election. It was held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012. The Democratic nominee, incumbent President Barack Obama, and his running mate, Vice President Joe Biden, were re-elected to a second term, defeating the Republican nominee, former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney, and his running mate, Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.  As the incumbent president, Obama secured the Democratic nomination with no serious opposition. The Republican Party was more fractured; Mitt Romney was consistently competitive in the polls, but faced challenges from a number of more conservative contenders whose popularity each fluctuated, often besting Romney's. Romney effectively secured the nomination by early May as the economy improved, albeit at a persistently laggard rate. The campaign was marked by a sharp rise in fundraising, including from new nominally independent Super PACs. The campaigns focused heavily on domestic issues: debate centered largely around sound responses to the Great Recession in terms of economic recovery and job creation. Other issues included long-term federal budget issues, the future of social insurance programs, and the Affordable Care Act. Foreign policy was also discussed including the phase-out of the Iraq War, the size of and spending on the military, preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and appropriate counteractions to terrorism.  Obama would go on to defeat Romney in both the popular vote and the electoral college by a 3.9% popular vote margin and 126 votes in the electoral college. He became the eleventh President and third Democrat to win a majority of the popular vote more than once. Obama carried all states and districts (among states that allocate electoral votes by district) that he had won in the 2008 presidential election except North Carolina, Indiana, and Nebraska's 2nd congressional district.

It's interesting of its own accord, though you're also neglecting to consider Android device activations (which require a Gmail account).  Which should give you some idea of just how damned big Gmail is these days.  Google themselves have been generally claiming 300-500 million accounts, depending on how you slice it.  The 2.2 billion number surprised me, though it's been verified elsewhere by a team including a G+ employee.  I really wasn't particularly interested in the total, though it's reported as relevant to the analysis.  It's the actives I'm most interested in, and they're a lot lower than I'd thought.

A single can of soda is typically around 150 calories in 12 ounce can; and those little juice-boxes are if anything even more sugar-laden @ around 100+ calories in generally less than 8 ounces.  And most parents provide multiple doses of those per day (I doubt it is all that uncommon for a kid to get 500 or even 1000 calories per day just from juice/soda.)  And then things like breakfast cereal -- which are almost entirely carbohydrates to begin with, even without the ""sugar-frosting"" -- and are consumed not only as a breakfast food, but a (so called) ""healthy snack"". (And while the ""serving size"" on the box probably says it's just 80 to 100 calories, that serving size is generally a lot less than the kids actually consume in a bowl -- most kids will probably eat 2 to 3 ""servings"" worth at a sitting... all ""empty calories"".)

Provided they are given the opportunity to burn them off (outside recess, just general ""running around"", etc).  The problem/solution is NOT to make pizza ""healthier"" (by which I assume she thinks the meat & cheese should be reduced or removed and lots of uncooked veges added -- doubtless she'd like to see them eating something packaged as ""No need to heat... tofu & broccoli, with rice-cake crust, pizza"")...  No the problem/solution is to let the kids actually BE kids, rather than strapping them into school-desks with little or no recess (not to mention drugging them with ritalin/adderall so that they ""focus"" like zombies); and then to get parents to STOP being so paranoid about ""stranger danger"" pedophiles that when they get home they force the kids to stay inside and sit in front of the TV, computer, game console (and munch on more snacks).

The plane crash survivors discovered curious scientific installations, other people living on the island, a secret political organization that had their own submarine for transiting personnel to and from the island and many twists. Who was good and who wasn't was a constant question. One season restarted from before the flight and had it not crash and showed how the passengers would have gone on with life normally. This was intercut with island life.   They invented a story device now called a ""flash sideways"" to have a character living a parallel life or alternate existence. There were hints of time travel and immortality. It was intriguing and confusing. Story threads spanned multiple episodes and critical  events could take seasons to be recalled. The explanations were never quite complete and plot points never quite resolved.  It was innovative and demanded viewer attention in a way that television avoids. There was a great mystery that didn't unfold linearly and revealed new secrets that ran counter and at tangents to everything before. At times it felt like there was some interesting path the story was going to find and the it threw one off to a completely different concept.  The ending wrapped it up with an easy and unsatisfying package in a way that seemed like the writers just gave up. They had no idea where they had been going the whole time, but they sure knew how to make viewers think they had a great new idea."

And though they left a lot of questions about wtf was up with the island at the end, they left only a handful about characters themselves. They chose to go with an ending that was character focused. I thought it worked perfectly because it was a character centric show."

Mac were at below 5% marketshare in the early 2000 and I believe they are still quite low (around 14% in the US and much lower everywhere else). On top of that, their bestseller is the MacBook Air whose price has consistently been falling off. The Ipod is dying and the Ipad has been decreasing steadily for a couple of years now.

If someone had a broken leg not a single person around them would accept any of these as an excuse and would do everything they could to get them to the hospital and if the situation were bad enough (compound fracture/bones sticking out of their leg) they could possible be made to go because they would appear to be mentally impaired for refusing to have medical attention in a potentially life threatening condition.

For the purposes of the metaphor we're not talking about compound fractures. There are probably a lot of homeless people with broken limbs that were healed over without being set.

NoShitSherlock,2rwc3n,wolfkin,-6,Fri Jan 16 06:10:55 2015 UTC,misleading headline.  it's not that healthy obesity is a myth. It's 'real'. It's just not likely to be stable. it's like saying you're on the verge of being poor. You're fine on the verge but most people slip into poverty. The same way if everyone stayed in that 'healthy obesity' level they're fine but people slip and when they slip they'r enow in unhealthy obesity.

NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,redw04,4,Fri Jan 9 16:07:44 2015 UTC,Meth or PCP or Heroin are also pretty scary ass drugs.

It's a tough point to debate"
NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,redw04,6,Fri Jan 9 16:57:04 2015 UTC,"People do shitty things under the influence of alcohol. Very shitty things. Go to listen during a few AA meetings.  People lie, cheat and steal. They verbally and/or physically abuse family members. They assault people. They drive while intoxicated and either injure or kill people. They even rape or kill people sometimes because it just seemed like a good idea to their heavily intoxicated brain at the time. This is ignoring the body and mental health problems alcohol abuse causes the addict that makes them an extra burden on the health care system.  Here's the kicker, something like 1 in 5 people abuse alcohol regularly, and 1 in 12 is a full blown alcoholic. Half the guys in the county jail are in there because they did something stupid while they were drunk. Alcohol shouldn't be legal if the litmus test for defining a ""problem drug"" is damage to society.   The problem is if you make alcohol illegal you end up with far worse problems. Aside from the product quality and safety being terrible in the black market, if your business operations are illegal then you can't use the legal system to make sure people honor agreements or to recoup money you're owed, etc. What recourse does that leave when you have a problem with a competitor, supplier or customer? Violence.   Violence is rewarded in the black market because it means people fear competing with you, fear stealing from you, and fear ratting on you. The legal system doesn't offer much for disincentives against violence because of the heavy-handed sentencing for drug crimes. After all, an assault charge isn't a big deal when you're already doing something that could land you in prison for 20 years.  It's the lesser of evils to just make everything legal and regulate it. We have or can create laws to protect society from addicts. The way it's working now we're punishing non-violent addicts, who are victims of their own human physiology (drugs hijack your brain's reward system), and enabling a system that feeds massive amounts of money to very violent people."

NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,ikorolou,2,Sat Jan 10 05:27:09 2015 UTC,What's wrong with decriminalization? Sending addicts to rehab seems way more constructive than sending them to jail.
NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,blacksheep998,2,Fri Jan 9 17:11:50 2015 UTC,The drug supply has no regulation.  Users cannot guarantee what they get.  It also keeps the black market in place that attracts people to the quick money making something in demand illegal creates. This leads to other criminal activity.
NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,GracchiBros,1 point,Fri Jan 9 17:20:43 2015 UTC,I'm not advocating full legalization for both the reasons you stated and others.  Selling drugs would still be a criminal offense. The only difference that decriminalization of drugs would make is that users caught with drugs would be sent to rehab instead of jail.
NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,blacksheep998,1 point,Fri Jan 9 17:29:37 2015 UTC,"Huh?  I listed reasons against decriminalization.  As you say, decriminalization only resolves one (it would make users more likely to seek help as well) of the many problems prohibition has caused."
NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,GracchiBros,2,Fri Jan 9 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand. I was trying to explain why those weren't good reasons.  As I said in another reply:   But lots of people (and I've known a few) have resorted to selling drugs or stealing because there's no other way for them. They don't have an easy legal alternative. If there's a way for an addict to get help without fear of punishment then a good number of them (not all of course) are going to try that before they resort to selling or stealing to feed the habit further.   Under decriminalization, selling drugs would still be illegal. As would any crimes committed because of them. The difference would be more former addicts living as constructive members of society and fewer current addicts living in jail still supporting the sellers because there's no shortage of drugs in jail.  This lowers the amount of sellers and of drug related crimes in general.  Decriminalization won't end drug use of course, I don't think anyone claims that. But it will result in lower drug use and lower levels of drug related crimes vs our current prohibition system."
NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,blacksheep998,1 point,Fri Jan 9 17:53:19 2015 UTC,"So why not make them legal and make many of those selling jobs legal as well?  Why not regulate the system so a user can know how much of what they are getting?  Logically, you have to think the downsides are worse and I don't see how unless you think there are millions of people whose lives have been saved due to making selling illegal.  I haven't seen anything to suggest that's reality."
NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,GracchiBros,1 point,Fri Jan 9 18:03:35 2015 UTC,"Because lots of drugs are very harmful even when they're not cut with more harmful substances.  Things like PCP and meth are scary drugs and we shouldn't be condoning their use. The people selling them know that they're killing people and they should face punishment for that.  The small time users are totally different though. Many of them are guilty of no crime other than being addicts.  Sending them to jail doesn't help them. In fact, it turns many of them into much worse criminals."
NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,blacksheep998,1 point,Fri Jan 9 18:18:26 2015 UTC,"So even if the laws hurt more people than the drugs themselves (which are being sold and used anyway),  it's more important to get retribution?"
NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,GracchiBros,1 point,Fri Jan 9 18:25:55 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, with no uncertainty, but that to me means reform of the bill allowing addicts to get the help they need without fear of penalty, but I still don't think decriminalization is necessary for that. On top of that, there are addicts who do or have done bad things to get money for their habit, so while sending them straight to jail isn't productive, they should be held on higher scrutiny after being released from rehab."
NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,redw04,1 point,Fri Jan 9 17:21:02 2015 UTC,"We need the reform you mentioned, but I don't see it happening while possession of a small amount of drugs is enough to send you to jail for years at a time.  I'm not saying we should let people sell drugs on the street, and of course those who have broken the law because of drugs should face punishment for any crimes they committed.   But lots of people (and I've known a few) have resorted to selling drugs or stealing because there's no other way for them. They don't have an easy legal alternative. If there's a way for an addict to get help without fear of punishment then a good number of them (not all of course) are going to try that before they resort to selling or stealing to feed the habit further."
NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,blacksheep998,1 point,Fri Jan 9 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"I don't possibly see how my alternative is worth the millions of lives wasted in our legal system, the erosion of our liberties justified by going after drug users, and the many thousands killed because of the lack of regulated supply or safe ability to get help.  Do you really think that that millions of more people would have their lives ruined if these drugs were legal over and above the ones that already do? I don't see how anyone can come to that logical conclusion except an extreme to the point of silly distrust of anyone that's not themselves."
NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,GracchiBros,1 point,Fri Jan 9 17:18:21 2015 UTC,Sale and manufacture can continue to be illegal while decriminalizing use. At least that will allow people to get medical help without having to fear being fined and/or incarcerated (and often billed for being jailed).
NoShitSherlock,2ruzn6,ravenouscraving,1 point,Fri Jan 9 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"i think harder drugs shouldnt be criminalized(unless your dealing them in big amounts, such as selling a few bricks of coke) while lighter, more natural drugs are allowed. we also need to teach what drugs are actually like and not just ""drugs give your cancer and make you lose controll of your body and possibly make you murder people"". weed isnt going to do much for you and isnt any worse than alchohal but meth will fuck you up. punishment for using harder drugs should be rehab and not jail time. throwing someone who has a drug addition in jail wont do anything because they will hop right back on the drug when they get out but rehab can keep people off of it(there will still be people who will do it anyways or stop just from jail but rehab is more successful)"

NoShitSherlock,2qfvsr,begrudged,3,Fri Dec 26 20:21:16 2014 UTC,"Given collusion and price fixing, I tend to hate most ISPs a similar amount.  That said, TWC has been the best choice we've had for a while. Service gets frustrating sometimes, like how you have to play hardball with them to get them to upgrade your service to a modern package. No, $50 for 15Mbps down, .5 up is out of date, and we refuse to pay for it any longer. I'll take the 30 down, 5 up package you're advertising on your front page, else we will have to change our internet to something more cost effective.  Seriously, I get that they're not required to call us and say ""hey, we notice you're getting 1/4 the service for the same price,"" but I get pissed when I have to handle the call because they won't just say ""yes ma'am"" when the account holder calls and asks for it.  All this said, I am hoping to see community broadband continue rising. The legal efforts by large companies, including but not limited to TWC and Comcast, to squash competition is underhanded and despicable. The frustration of most people having absolutely no choice but to pay for service that they know is overpriced and underpowered just multiplies it all.  In a way it's like having a toll on your own front door, and a bunch of thugs offering you safe passage all for the same price with only inconsequential differences in their methods.  /edit: Holy fuck that turned into a rant  TL;DR Yes, the services usually work, but given collusion, price fixing, underhanded legal tactics, and arbitrarily limiting performance, almost everyone knows these companies are bad for the internet as a whole, let alone to the people that are practically required to buy their service."

Here's my theory: Having lower income parents is also correlated with having poor math test scores and children with lower income parents are more likely to be fed fast food on a regular basis.  This is almost certainly just another correlation related to income to add to the pile.

""Family socioeconomic characteristics were parent reports of household income-to-needs ratio, combined parent highest education, household food insecurity,18 and maternal employment."" pp 3.  Here is the abstract.  Objective. The objective of this study is to examine the associations between fast food consumption and the academic growth of 8544 fifth-grade children in reading, math, and science. Method. This study uses direct assessments of academic achievement and child-reported fast food consumption from a nationally representative sample of kindergartners followed through eighth grade. Results. More than two thirds of the sample reported some fast food consumption; 20% reported consuming at least 4 fast food meals in the prior week. Fast food consumption during fifth grade predicted lower levels of academic achievement in all 3 subjects in eighth grade, even when fifth grade academic scores and numerous potential confounding variables, including socioeconomic indicators, physical activity, and TV watching, were controlled for in the models. Conclusion. These results provide initial evidence that high levels of fast food consumption are predictive of slower growth in academic skills in a nationally representative sample of children"

Plenty think he's actually an okay guy with good points. It reminds me of how C S Lewis is widely regarded as a great apologist, and this view comes almost exclusively from Christians. In reality Lewis was a great writer, but his arguments are pretty readily dismantled by anyone not automatically ignoring the gaps, unfounded assertions, and the suppositions on which his arguments rest. For example, Lewis' claim that humans having similar moral systems worldwide means God. It couldn't possibly be convergent social practices based on shared biology! His liar, lunatic or fraud argument assumes we have accurate records of the life of Jesus. i.e. we don't even know that Jesus claimed what he is said to have claimed.   I can respect plenty of Christians, the intellectually honest ones and the just plain honest ones. Cameron fits neither of these categories. Intellectual honesty to Cameron is what a jog in the park is to a fish. He's had no experience with it and is unlikely to anytime soon.  Edit: clarified"

He must have a million yes men surrounding him praising both his talent and his faith. When was the last time he had an honest discourse with anyone? The arguments made in the movie sound laughable and the logic tortured at best. How many people around him just nod and smile all the time? How long has he listened to only his own voice echoed back before deciding this was profound insight?   Even this film, from the sounds of it, with its sanctification of consumerism and wealth is really the Kirk trying to rationalize how he gets to be Kirk and can still be considered one of the chosen.

Feminism is the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men. Egalitarian doctrines maintain that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or social status.    Feminism specifically to refers to inequality experienced by women, but it in no way conflicts with egalitarianism or implies that women are superior to men."

However my point still stands- calling them something other than feminists would destroy the history. (HIS-STORY) of what it was like.

You still have not given any concrete examples of ""suffering"" other than tired old tropes of days gone by that don't apply to modern society. But since you seem fixated on the past let's go there.  Men were never property?  Yea you're gonna have to look up Feudalism which was the ancestor of modern Western society..  Men and women alike couldn't own land, had the privilege of working for a master and paying homage in coin and goods in order to live.  Unless you were nobility you were a peasant and fucked.  This is not exclusive to women.  You had no freedom and failing to pay meant death.  You think men today in prison at the mercy of the state are not property made to labor for free?  That's state run slavery.  You think they have rights?  And yes, today's third wave feminism has gone off the rails and does not deserve the equal rights banner it purports to fly when it disenfranchises, ignores, and belittles the current suffering of others because of some past wrongs and at the same time claims it will help those same people.  How the hell is that ""equal rights""    You may not be a troll, but I can't tell the difference really.  It's Poe 's Law in how your reply is indistinguishable from someone actually trying to rile people up with over the top comments.

Take history for example.    late 14c., ""relation of incidents"" (true or false), from Old French estoire, estorie ""chronicle, history, story"" (12c., Modern French histoire), from Latin historia ""narrative of past events, account, tale, story,"" from Greek historia ""a learning or knowing by inquiry; an account of one's inquiries, history, record, narrative,"" from historein ""inquire,"" from histor ""wise man, judge,"" from PIE *wid-tor-, from root *weid- ""to know,"" literally ""to see"" (see vision).    The word has barely changed from the original latin. It has no relation to modern english pronouns what-so-ever.

The fact that we have feminazis* and a congregation of white cis male haters who are being the advertised forefront of neo feminism, I think makes it just. We have a group of women filled with more hate than even the KKK has these days. That's kind of nuts. Where saying hi to a women on the street is harassment or attempted rape.

That analogy doesn't apply at all. You can't just say ""I have an STD, and I'm going to have AIDS right now."" If you don't have AIDS, you don't have AIDS available to you.  The ""subset"" of STD->AIDS is a classifying a distinct physical infection within its mode of transmission. The ""subset"" of harassment->sexual harassment is a matter of classifying a tactic into a goal.  You can say, ""I harass people, and I'm going to do it in a sex-related way now."" If you're a bully, sexual harassment is one of the ways you can harass someone. It's a choice of method, and it's reasonable that if your game is harassment, your tactic might be sexual harassment.

It's not necessarily proving that video games cause a reduction in violence, but there's no way that it's causing an increase in violence, since youth violence in general has seen no increase in recent years. The issue with the original title isn't with causation VS. correlation, but that it found that there may be a link, but the link would be negative if there is a link at all."

In the case of Comcast and Time-Warner, there's active collusion where one will actually pull out of an unprofitable neighborhood and ""give"" it to the other.  DSL isn't much better. Most cities have, at most, one telecom operator that provides all phone service, including DSL. Third-party local ISPs compete on what endpoint services you get, but that's all. The actual level of service is entirely up to the sole telecom provider for the area. In some cases, there are two telecom operators, but only a handful of Central Offices between them, limiting options.  Then a few cities have fiber providers, which are almost always absurdly expensive, unless it's Google or Municipal Broadband (owned or built by the City).  So unless you live in dense metro areas like New York City or in areas like Silicon Valley, your options amount to ""Company that everyone hates for justifiable reasons"" and ""Company that offers almost no services whatsoever."""

I'm no anti-vaxxer, and I do think that people should believe in valid scientific research and facts. The problem is that a lot of people aren't very well informed as to who they should trust to provide the facts. I think that the media is probably the most blame worthy entity as far as that goes. The ""news"" media in the USA and other countries I'm sure,  is constantly reporting half truths and outright lies just to grab people's attention. Some people who may not have the best education or who may just be paranoid of (perhaps for good reason) the powers that be, just can't separate the truth through all the bullshit. The Ebola scare going on right now is a good example of how this can happen. Some people can see right through the sensationalism and know that it's a ploy for the media companies to cash in on people's fear. Other people though may see it as a plot by the government or some other entity and will only believe what seems logical to them through their skewed vision of the truth. The problem with this is that sometimes the ""conspiracy theorists"" are right. There have been government and media plots to mislead the general public."
