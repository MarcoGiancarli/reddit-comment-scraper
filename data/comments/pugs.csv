We all loved him and would never intentionally hurt him and I'm sure you felt the same way. Sometimes bad things just happen. Maybe you could have done a single small thing differently and the outcome would have been different but that doesn't mean you did anything wrong.   I understand how you feel, but I hope you know that whatever happened was not your fault. I believe our dogs always know on some level how much we love them and when they pass on, they pass on knowing that. Oreo knew you loved him and he loved you and in the end, that's what's important.    Losing your dog in any way is incredibly hard. I'm so sorry this happened."

Huskies are predisposed to hypothyroidism, which would lead to a pretty horrible quality of life. http://www.gsshc.com/hypothyroidism-in-the-siberian-husky.htm  German Shepherds commonly suffer from hip dysplasia. And it seems to me that walking would be pretty important for a dog as active as a German shepherd. http://www.petcarerx.com/article/german-shepherd-hip-dysplasia/1508  Beagles are prone to epilepsy. http://www.aladarbeagles.com/epilepsy.html  Boxers, Labs, and Golden Retrievers are at higher risk for cancer than other dogs. http://www.petmd.com/dog/slideshows/general-health/dog-breeds-highest-cancer-rate  But none of them receive criticism on any level, despite the fact that these problems are substantially worse than pugs' breathing issues (which are typically corrected early on with surgery, if it is deemed appropriate by a vet!)."

pugs,3csnns,digitalpizza,2,Fri Jul 10 17:13:49 2015 UTC,I suspect it comes off as nicer than it is in that photo.  It's much darker than it looks and is nothing more than standard berber style builder-grade carpet.  It actually pulls really easily.

pugs,3cpsqw,imadamb,10,Thu Jul 9 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"Ruby fell into our lives at just the right time. Our little dachshund mix passed away unexpectedly early November, on Thanksgiving we decided we'd start looking for another little friend for my bigger dog. We tried to adopt a couple of different Boston's but they didn't work out. In February a friend was looking for a home for this tiny little pug thing after discovering her Yorkie wasn't going to warm up to the idea of a little sister. Ruby was born on Thanksgiving, so we always kid about Matty helping get her ready for us. She's a tiny little pup, but she's been body building and eating well now that we've discovered Stella and Chewies freeze dried nuggets, and has packed on a few pounds. She weighed in at 13.1 when we dropped her off this morning. She's two and a half years old now, and is just the sweetest thing ever and means the world to us, so we're impatiently waiting for the all's clear call from our vet. They know how special little Ru' is though and take great care of her.  We wanted to have her first heat before getting her fixed, but then she had a false pregnancy that lasted until her second heat, which resulted in another false pregnancy, and she was finally ready enough to have the surgery. Glad for that, it took much longer than we anticipated to get it all done. She's getting a little growth on her lip and some baby teeth removed. Never nervous about these kinds of things, but this little girl means so much after losing Matty.... Anyhow, this is our little sweet potata, Ruby :)"

pugs,3caq7x,ciabattabing16,2,Mon Jul 6 13:00:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, my pug (a rescue from a backyard breeder) had most of his teeth pulled the first time they did a dental on him. He still has some upper and lower molars, and eats just fine. He even can crack a hard biscuit although I make sure he gets the smaller ones. He's a pug, so he'll be just fine with eating.   It's better for him to have the teeth gone, because bad teeth are painful for them. He'll adapt just fine to less teeth. You're doing the right thing.  Also, don't feel guilty about the teeth. My vet said that some dogs and breeds (like pugs) are more prone to bad teeth. The important thing is regular checkups and dentals when needed. The sedated cleaning is necessary even when they don't have visibly bad teeth because they get the best view of everything when they're not fighting a conscious dog.   Good luck!"

Use the edges to get around the deep sensitive areas. As long as you are gentle but firm around the eyes, give it a good scrub and pugster will be just dandy."

pugs,3btxqk,2TrikPony,3,Thu Jul 2 03:08:48 2015 UTC,"Some rescues that aren't pug specific may have puppies. You can check petfinder.com to see what might be available in your area. If not, you can search for legitimate, responsible breeders in your area and see if they might have a new litter coming soon. When you contact them, here's a good list of potential ways to find a breeder. There's also a list of questions you can ask. Basically, any responsible breeder will not have anything to hide and will welcome the opportunity to show you their home and how the puppies are raised. If there's any hesitation on their part, that's a warning sign that they may not be legitimate. I did a lot of research before finding a breeder that I was comfortable with. They were over 100 miles away, but I made the trip to visit their home and yard, meet the mother pug to make sure she wasn't being mistreated, and then felt comfortable enough to get a puppy from her litter."
pugs,3bs5wj,kalitarios,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"Be still, resolute and focused.  Throughout my journey so far, I have stumbled and become ungrounded more than a few times. Frustrations, setbacks and lost recipes didn’t help much.  One day I was in a rush and had called my dogs into the house so I could prepare to leave. My oldest dog, Oliver, refused to comply, and I grew impatient. I walked outside and called for him to come in. Oliver sat in defiance. Again I called and he remained, resolute. I decided to walk over to Oliver and try again, however as I approached, he laid down. Standing over him, I sighed and thought to myself “Fine, if you aren’t moving, neither will I.”  And so I sat down in the grass. I looked at Oliver and he looked up at me and closed his eyes. I took a deep breath and exhaled. I could feel the warmth of the sun and the breeze blowing over my skin. The sounds of cars, thoughts of tasks and work faded away and the songs of birds filled my ears.  What Oliver had done was teach me to be still. To remain resolute and to relax. Oliver had helped me realize that I needed to stop worrying and focus on nature and the good things around me.  Be bold, ambitious and take a leap of faith.  Many of life’s greatest discoveries, creations and changes happened because someone dared to question why. Dared to color outside the lines and take a chance at an idea. One of my dogs, Sam, is the very definition of rebel.  His chaotically good nature is a combination of good heart and free spirit; a pathfinder, benevolent and complete disregard for regulations.  Sam has been picked up by the police and brought home in a squad car for breaking out of the yard, stung by bees for wandering into the bushes, stepped on, drugged, knocked around and trapped in a closet. If it happens, it happens to Sam. That’s not to say he doesn’t go looking for trouble, but trouble always seems to find Sam, somehow.  One particular day, Sam had managed to wiggle himself between the fence and a large shrub and ran into the woods across the neighbor’s yard. I gave chase, and it was cat-and-mouse game of tag for about 15 minutes. Every time I thought I had Sam cornered, he would duck under a shrub or under some brush, where I couldn’t fit. By the time I had run around the obstacle, Sam had doubled back or moved on, and I found myself trying to keep up with a small dog who was outsmarting me.  When I finally managed to catch up to Sam, he had already made his way back to the yard. I shook my head and admired his tenacity to find adventure and fun in the world so full of boundaries and rules. I turned and locked the gate behind me, then started to head back into the house. Through all that chase I smiled and admitted to myself that it was actually quite entertaining trying to outmaneuver Sam. I heard a rustling in the bushes and when I glanced over, there was Sam, on the other side of the fence again, watching me for a moment before dashing back into the woods.  Sam taught me to let my guard down, to take chances and always include an element of enjoyment in everyday life. As we get older, we realize that some rules were made to be broken… to have courage enough to live on my own terms and never apologize for it. Go against the grain if need be, take the road less traveled and refuse to conform.  Create something that is greater than the assembled parts.  How can something so apparently opposite actually create a complementary relationship?  By themselves, Sam or Oliver are fun loving, free spirited companions that will bring cheer and warmth to my day. When they are together, their complementary methods of interaction form a dynamic relationship that cannot be broken. They are an indivisible whole; a team and an inspiration for my company, Sam & Oliver to model itself around. Stay resolute, passionate and confident. Take chances, focus on the good and to enjoy the adventure.  I love my pugs."

pugs,3bjqvw,areeoddnuh,3,Mon Jun 29 20:03:16 2015 UTC,"I would do the fostering. I haven't fostered a pug but I did foster another dog and it's a great experience. Be prepared to give him/her up though if someone submits an adoption form and you don't have the money saved yet. Also, estimate how much a dog costs and multiply that by like 5. Unexpected vet bills always seem to come up. So far, my pug has required a 5 K bowel surgery for eating a tampon out of a garbage, and probably 2 K in other bills most relating to multiple urinary tract infections that turned into a kidney infection, and a couple weird episodes of gastric upset. And then there's all the regular vet bills like vaccines and checkups once a year, and probably a teeth cleaning/extraction around middle age (6-8 years old). But fostering is great having the agency pay all the vet bills!"

Fosting is also a good way to see some of the issues a dog can/will have to know on an annual basis what you really need to have set aside for their vet care.  I'm not talking about $200, I'm talking about $1000+ of a safety net for their wellbeing."

pugs,3bh3j1,killmesara,8,Mon Jun 29 04:11:48 2015 UTC,Please take Maggie to the vet ASAP! Your girl is suffering and needs care. Nose bleeds and green eye discharge are NOT okay. I understand times are tough financially but this is something you don't want to mess with. You can't go to Reddit for sound veterinarian advice. :-/  Please update us on her condition.
pugs,3bh3j1,StereotypesSaveTime2,3,Mon Jun 29 05:04:13 2015 UTC,"Best course of action would be to see a vet immediately and rule out an infection. With that being said, if you absolutely cannot afford it, some temporary means to alleviate some of her symptoms would be instilling an ophthalmic lubricating gel, such as Systane, into her goopy eye several times a day. My little guy, Mugsy, had keratoconjunctivitis sicca which did not respond to steroid eye drops, and eventually we had to get the affected eye removed. The green mucus was being secreted to compensate for the lack of tears. The mucousy discharge would weep down into his skin folds and cause irritation and itching on his face. The eye gel will only temporarily help, and your girl will need to be placed on long term steroidal eye drops, most likely Optimmune, because the cornea will continue to dry out and is at risk of rupturing. As far as the cough, wheezing, nosebleeds, dogs can develop allergies just as we humans can. The coughing and wheezing may be a symptom of this, give your house a thorough cleaning and vacuuming, as well as clean all air filters in your furnace or air conditioning units. Don't allow anyone to smoke in your home or around Maggie. My vet has told me that when Mugsy's coughing, hacking, and wheezing is bad, to orally give him 25mg of diphenhydramine (Benadryl) every 4-6 hours to control it. With all that being said, please see a veterinarian. There are many low cost vet clinics, call around to local shelters and see who these use, and get your baby in, it really sounds like she needs to be seen by a professional. Edited to add: Prednisone is an immune suppressant. If the other dog had any type of illness, your Maggie has a very high susceptibility of catching it due to the prednisone weakening her body's natural immune system. Having shivers can be from having a fever due to infection. Infections left untreated can lead to systemic organ failure, so I will say it again, please take her in ASAP."
pugs,3bh3j1,LoriCupcake,3,Mon Jun 29 12:39:09 2015 UTC,"Some vets and emergency vets can set up a payment plan. Your dog needs to see a vet now. Don't wait until you can't save her.

pugs,3b8dax,rhit06,4,Sat Jun 27 01:28:07 2015 UTC,"He just loves to be chased. He loves to run up and steal something you have or grab something on the floor he shouldn't and make you chase him until you catch him, flip him over, and rub his belly.   When you're chasing him, if you stop and he's not done being chased, he'll bark at you until you start running again. His favorite spot is to run circles around the livingroom table."
pugs,3b8dax,rhit06,2,Sat Jun 27 02:20:51 2015 UTC,I was mostly just making a joke that he was running away from a banana :-). My guy loves to be chased too.
pugs,3b8dax,mrsdavyjones,2,Sat Jun 27 02:24:58 2015 UTC,"My pug is Queequeg's brother! I looked at this pic and thought, ""Wait, this dog looks oddly similar to mine. Also, I need a life."" Then I looked though my reddit post history and realized that yours is the other one from the litter!  Oddly, Gimli doesn't like being chased at all (it seems to terrify him), but he LOVES to chase someone else. Then it gives him the puppy zoomies and he runs around the living room for a while.  Additionally, this picture made me laugh until I cried. I think that as a whole, pug people are the type that do things like chase their dogs in banana costumes. :D"

Then yesterday he had a big episode where he seemingly couldn't use his right front leg, then this morning it was both front legs, then this afternoon his hind legs were getting affected.  Blood work came back fine so best guess was a pretty significant neurological or spinal issue. He started to whine a little as the day went on so we knew he was in pain and the decision had to be made.  He was given the initial sedative while I fed him treats and he fell asleep within seconds. It was honestly the hardest decision of my life."
pugs,3b0wc1,SteelGlory,16,Thu Jun 25 03:32:01 2015 UTC,You made the right choice. You gave that dog the best 13 years it could of asked for. I hope you are doing alright.

pugs,3b0wc1,munchkinchic,6,Thu Jun 25 06:06:09 2015 UTC,"friend, i'm going through this same decision right now and it feels terrible. my pug, Tilly, has nerve damage in her spine and her back legs seize up about once a day for 5-10 minutes.   She cries and can't walk, and like you mentioned, it's awful knowing that she's in pain. i feel awful because I know putting her to sleep is the right thing, but I very selfishly don't want to.  i'm so sorry for your loss, thank you for sharing with me and giving me the courage to make this hard decision. he is a precious boy and i'm glad he had you as his human."
pugs,3b0wc1,Frozty23,7,Thu Jun 25 07:13:49 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry to hear you're in the same situation.   The options for us were to either let Quinton go to sleep peacefully with his family that adored him petting and feeding him, or to undergo numerous tests and procedures in the hopes of a miracle solution. Realistically we didn't want to force him into a situation where he would certainly be terrified and in pain any further.  It may have been the right thing to do, but it was also the hardest moment of my life.  Is Tilly fine the rest of the time outside of those 5-10 minutes?"
pugs,3b0wc1,munchkinchic,3,Thu Jun 25 07:52:46 2015 UTC,Realistically we didn't want to force him into a situation where he would certainly be terrified and in pain any further.   Damn. I am saving this.  I fear that day when we will face this decision for either of our two aging pugs that we have 10 years now since they were 6 weeks old.  Thinking of it in terms of minimizing their discomfort rather than trying to squeeze out just a little more time when they are obviously suffering will help me make that right call.
pugs,3b0wc1,worldvirus,2,Thu Jun 25 12:00:52 2015 UTC,"It really is such a hard decision and I hope that you have peace from your decision.  Tilly has always had hip problems; in the past, we could pick her up and she'd be fine, but lately, her seizes have been lasting longer and are more frequent. She's also been having accidents in the house and sleeps about 22 hours a day. She can't go on walks any more, and she sits or lies down instead of standing or walking, I think due to pain. I feel like her quality of life just isn't what it used to be and that the pain she does experience is scary and traumatic for her.   It's just sad when furry friends hurt :("

Then he picked up his spear without saying anything and limped over to Beaumont. He knelt down beside him ad took his head on his lap. He stroked Beaumont's head and said, ""Hark to Beaumont. Softly, Beaumont, mon amy. Oyez a Beaumont the valiant. Swef, le douce Beaumont, swef, swef."" Beaumont licked his hand but could not wag his tail. The huntsman nodded to Robin, who was standing behind, and held the hound's eyes with his own. He said, ""Good dog, Beaumont the valiant, sleep now, old friend Beaumont, good old dog.""

I want to take my dogs (one being a pug) to the beach this year but am afraid of getting myself cloth seats ruined. Should I invest in one of those car seat covers? Should i find a place to rinse off my dog? The beach is about an hour drive if that matters.

When I have taken him to the river I usually put a towel down because of the sand and him being wet. I usually don't worry about it because I just vacuum my car out afterwards. Yes I have cloth seats too. Usually just a towel though and dry him off the best I can before he gets in my car.

pugs,3aqzl1,GodRibs,6,Mon Jun 22 20:18:24 2015 UTC,"Pugs, like any purebred dog, can have health issues.  In my opinion the health problems (especially as described on reddit) are blown way out of proportion.  Many can be prevented with proper care and maintenance.  For example regular nose wrinkle cleaning is a must.  They can ""overheat"" if it is too hot so you have to take care on what the temperature is before taking them on a super long trek.  This is not to say they need to be in the AC all the time by any means.  Mine loves running around outdoors and playing on warm days.  The ""health problem"" of overheating is solved simply by being conscious of the potential issue and mitigating it.  Many health issues are caused by overweight dogs.  Keeping your pug trim and active helps avoid many of those problems as well.  Outside of health issues they are the most lovey, goofy, cuddly dogs out there.  From personal experience mine is almost 5 and I have had no health costs out of normal vet checkups/neutering. I expect that will change as he gets a bit older but that is true for any breed.  Can pugs have health problems?  Yes.   Do I think they get a bad rap more than any other breed? Yes.  I think pugs are amazing dogs and companions.  Simply being aware of potential problems and doing what you can to avoid them will alleviate most of the health concerns you hear about pugs so much.  But also be responsible in understanding and being prepared for when/if an unexpected vet expense might arise.  Before I met a pug for the first time I admit I was not a fan and thought they were a bit ugly.  Having met one I fell in love with their personality and how they look.  Having had a pug I don't think I'll ever own another type of dog.  They are your constant shadow and lap warmer from day one, and will never fail to provide a laugh when you need one.  Edit: /u/dvlman makes a great point I forgot.  Breeder research is very important to getting a healthy pug from the start.  Bad breeders certainly don't help pugs health problem reputation."
pugs,3aqzl1,rhit06,3,Mon Jun 22 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"You said all the things I wanted to say, but I got hung up on the breeder part. My little guy loves to run, and like you said, we just prepare before we leave the house. We bring water for us, and water for him, pretty simple. I don't see us owning any other breed either. They are the sweetest animals on the planet."
pugs,3aqzl1,rhit06,2,Mon Jun 22 21:09:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for you're reply, you guys have reinforced my idea of getting a pug. Me and my girlfriend are massive pug fans often trying to spot them whilst out driving.   From the feedback it seems the health problems are blown out of proportion."
pugs,3aqzl1,rhit06,2,Tue Jun 23 06:24:12 2015 UTC,"Happy to help.    My first dog was a pug, but my wife grew up with other dogs.  She's a pug lover now too I think.  Like I said 5 years in no health problems yet.  Pugs are amazing dogs, but one thing I didn't mention is that they are a bit stubborn (or can be -- the problem being they think they're people).  If you are first time dog owner be ready to expect house breaking might take some time.  Just use positive reinforcement as much as possible.  Pugs love positive reinforcement and strive to please their people.  Anyway.  If you have pug questions this is a great subreddit or just pm me:-). Good Luck!"

pugs,3ap2ek,izmatron,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:49:42 2015 UTC,I have a black pug and do a big 1/2 cup 2x a day so pretty similar.  Thankfully he's gotten pretty good about not snarfing his food so days when he isn't as hungry he may leave some in the bowl and come back to finish after a nap or two :-)  Most days he usually gets some small carrot or celery pieces too as treats.
pugs,3ap2ek,madhattergirl,2,Mon Jun 22 16:58:15 2015 UTC,we fed our pug wet food for awhile.... and she seemed to do the same thing.. so we switched to dry food... 2 times a day and she perked back up. also the wet food seemed to mess with her tummy after awhile. no matter what brand we used. so dry food it was. and she's been fine ever since.
pugs,3ap2ek,PK73,2,Mon Jun 22 17:14:00 2015 UTC,My two guys get 1/4 cup of dry food (Organix Small Breed) four times a day. Our vet has remarked multiple times about how perfect their weight is and how they have steadily maintained. It seems the multiple meals keeps their metabolism up. We are also careful on the amount and types of treats as well.
pugs,3ap2ek,mediweevil,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"We give our guy about a 1/4 of dry food twice a day with a spoonful of wet food (mainly to coat the food so he eats it all) and about 1/8 of frozen cut up carrots.  The carrots are great since they're a nice filler and he's lost weight, has less farts, and firmer poops."

Add in a few treats during the day and a baby carrot or two in the evening, and that's her daily food intake. She's usually between 18-20lbs depending on the day, so she's not super skinny."

One thing I would teach them while young is how to interact with people touching their paws and cutting their nails. I would recommend using the desensitizing method of after cutting a nail say ""good boy!"", give lots of rubs and also a little treat. That will make them less likely to hate nail trimming later in life. Also, bathe them at home for the first few baths. Don't bring them anywhere where they might feel abandoned. Then do the desensitizing again but in the tub. Give positive sayings, lots of rubs and treats. That should help considerably. C:"

pugs,3a7jgb,dzsquared,2,Thu Jun 18 05:04:12 2015 UTC,"Not a groomer, but a foster parent.  I've trimmed nails on about 15 different pugs in the last 3 years of varying stages of life.  Many pugs are absolutely horrendous about having their nails done, but some are totally chill about it.  For pugs that can handle the noise, I prefer to use a dremel because it has a lower chance of splitting the nail, can get nice rounded edges, and you can see when you get closer to the quick.  Some pugs like to be cradled like a baby, and for pugs that like/tolerate it I prefer that ""hold"" because I have easy access to all 4 legs and can support them nicely while telling them what an adorable, loveable, amazing creature they are. I try to spend a lot of time ""holding paws"" with the dogs as well, I've had to soak/treat the feet of ex-breeders for cysts etc. Loving and tender touches all over the feet go a long way, especially when you start them during ""tv time"" and bedtime."

pugs,3a4ujr,pullacatengo,2,Wed Jun 17 06:13:23 2015 UTC,Is there a story here?
pugs,3a4ujr,PookyBearTrady,3,Wed Jun 17 17:11:04 2015 UTC,I forgot to post it :/  Eli was recently diagnosed with a luxated patella. Turns out his tendons are actually tilorn behind his knee and he needs surgery. I have Googled some to see if any organizations out there might be able to help with the cost but didn't find much. Have any of you experience or knowledge of any organizations that could help? I just want him to be better soon and the surgery is pricey. He helped me through cancer and I want to help him though this. Thanks in advance.
pugs,3a4ujr,xthedevilsadvocatex,3,Wed Jun 17 19:05:31 2015 UTC,"I have seen people run gofundme campaigns for help in covering the costs. I don't know of any official organizations that routinely do this though. Perhaps talk to some of the local veterinarians, and if there is a veterinarian school within driving distance, see if they offer any services for the aid of teaching students. Best of luck, he looks like such a sweet pup."
pugs,3a4ujr,xthedevilsadvocatex,5,Wed Jun 17 19:28:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you (: we don't have any vet school nearby unfortunately. We did set up a gofundme, just having a hard time with getting it seen by lots of people.  Thanks for your well wishes!"

pugs,39eqvw,turtlewheels,3,Thu Jun 11 12:19:13 2015 UTC,She was really high and couldn't keep her tongue in her mouth lol
pugs,39eqvw,PinkDalek,11,Thu Jun 11 16:33:15 2015 UTC,Evee had to get a cyst removed (third time in 2 years!!!) from her tummy. This one was much much larger than the ones we have seen before so the incision was much larger so she is in a lot of pain. Her brother (not a pug) loves licking her so we had to buy her a baby shirt to make sure he didn't have easy access. Evee is currently high on morphine and a million times more cuddly than normal so she is getting all kinds of loving from us!!
pugs,39eqvw,orlanderlv,3,Thu Jun 11 06:13:10 2015 UTC,I like her baby shirt! Don't squeeze her too hard until she's all healed up! :)

pugs,39eqvw,JustAmys,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:18:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely! She's already looking a lot better, it's just her scar is really big so I'm avoiding the other pups licking it. Also preventing her from jumping too much"

pugs,39da2r,EctoplasmTourniquet,3,Thu Jun 11 00:42:58 2015 UTC,Why... Did you buy Apple Watch if you think it's lame?
pugs,39da2r,SimplyQuid,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:07:21 2015 UTC,"I bought it because I like gadgets and it brings me one step closer to my dream of becoming a cyborg one day. What I don't like about it is that the apps are few and not very well designed, the activity reminders are annoying and not very accurate (pop ups tell me ""Time to stand"" while I'm standing all the time), and I hate that when I lift my wrist up to look at the time there's a good chance the screen doesn't even turn on unless I make this dramatic wrist lifting motion. It's a step down from my 90s Casio calculator watch."
pugs,39da2r,Robo13,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:23:02 2015 UTC,"It's the first watch, and the first OS with a few updates. More apps are coming for it with Watch OS 2, as well as bug fixes and other updates. You should tell Apple about the stuff you would like to see. Don't give up on it so quickly, I'm sure the future os upgrades will fix a lot of things."
pugs,39da2r,Legend9119,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:09:32 2015 UTC,What's lame about the Apple watch in your opinion?
pugs,39da2r,Bgndrsn,3,Thu Jun 11 04:58:53 2015 UTC,The wonderful thing Apple has going for it is the Apple watch is on par with the watches companies like Motorola and LG released 2 years ago but their consumer base thinks Apples is the revolutionary one without ever having heard of the others.

But, as time goes on and they get used to their surroundings regarding where you are when they sleep, they seem to be very easily disturbed.  Ours will be two years old tomorrow (NEED TO GET BIRTHDAY CAKE!) and he likes to snuggle next to me on the couch. Sometimes he gets himself into a goofy position and I go to take a picture but the slightest movement around his puggy circle of tranquility has him get up and look at me like a normal derpy pug.

pugs,38wves,Apologician,22,Sun Jun 7 14:57:23 2015 UTC,Our does this when I exit the bathroom.
pugs,38wves,Naturespocket,23,Sun Jun 7 16:28:57 2015 UTC,Lies. You can't get in a bathroom without a pug. They blast into the door and bark and scratch the door if they can't.
pugs,38wves,ciabattabing16,14,Sun Jun 7 22:41:33 2015 UTC,A minute longer and he probably would've keeled over from loneliness.
pugs,38wves,the-nub,8,Sun Jun 7 19:18:48 2015 UTC,"Well, who's getting the hugs here? I say that's a smug looking he's giving you."
pugs,38wves,MrFidel,8,Sun Jun 7 18:39:23 2015 UTC,I'd say that's pretty standard pug behavior. I'm gone for two weeks right now. I imagine he'll lose his mind when I get home haha.
pugs,38wves,purplepug22,13,Sun Jun 7 20:12:19 2015 UTC,Oh man you're in for a treat. I was gone for a week and my pug lost it when I walked in the door. Full on psycho dog with so much excitement.
pugs,38wves,katpissneverclean,8,Sun Jun 7 23:02:42 2015 UTC,"Each and everyday I come home from work as promised, yet each day my pug acts as if she was positive I had abandoned her for good this time."
pugs,38wves,somecrazybroad,7,Sun Jun 7 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"My pug stays with my parents & she absolutely loses mind when I come home for a visit. She literally screams, runs to both of my parents barking to let them know I'm there, knocks our other dog out of the way, then grabs a toy & starts chewing on it while staring at me."
pugs,38wves,RavenousOyster,5,Mon Jun 8 03:19:56 2015 UTC,"that's not how you spell ""adorablicious"""
pugs,38wves,darkmagician47,4,Sun Jun 7 22:30:22 2015 UTC,lol... when we go to the store.... and dont take our pug.... she will stand in the window and look out... its the most pitiful thing you ever saw... eyes big... standing in the window watching us leave. and when we get back.. she darts around like a rocket all excited lol.
pugs,38wves,twiliprince6,2,Mon Jun 8 13:21:56 2015 UTC,"Mine squeals and cries and carries on every time I get up and put shoes on, or my parents call me."
pugs,38yzqq,kirmur3,2,Mon Jun 8 01:07:23 2015 UTC,"I'm conflicted, sure this pug is cute but I'm not sure I can forgive the fact you didn't know there already is a sharknado 2"

pugs,38unzi,IHoldConvosWithCats,5,Sat Jun 6 23:49:46 2015 UTC,Awesome! Great looking pug... my rescue had long nails as well. Take her to get her nails trimmed every two weeks and the quick will work it's way back.
pugs,38unzi,turbosi,3,Sun Jun 7 02:02:44 2015 UTC,I've been using a nail file for them since she hates getting them clipped. If you have any suggestions on how to make her comfortable with clippers it'd be much appreciated! :D
pugs,38unzi,StereotypesSaveTime2,4,Sun Jun 7 04:11:25 2015 UTC,"Pugs are notoriously difficult when it comes to trimming their nails. If you can afford it and it's convenient, it's just plain worth it to pay a groomer to trim them. Money well spent!"
pugs,38unzi,ZePikachu,7,Sun Jun 7 06:49:39 2015 UTC,Used pugs are the best pugs!
pugs,38unzi,Brobi_WanKenobi,10,Sun Jun 7 03:21:25 2015 UTC,*Pre-loved pugs
pugs,38unzi,ZePikachu,4,Sun Jun 7 05:06:36 2015 UTC,YES. This is a much much MUCH better description! Who doesn't love puggies?
pugs,38unzi,tawney182,5,Sun Jun 7 05:13:11 2015 UTC,"I agree! When we met it was love at first sight! She's precious. She always has to be by me and if she's not she'll cry. Just the other day I was sitting in the living room and she decided she wanted to go lay on the bed, five seconds after she laid down she started whining because I didn't follow her."

pugs,38sjc0,clayduck,3,Sat Jun 6 13:07:24 2015 UTC,What in the world is that controller?
pugs,38sjc0,SimplyQuid,8,Sat Jun 6 17:03:25 2015 UTC,"It's a game pad that came out for mortal kombat x in the last few months. The buttons are rearranged a bit to help with combos, etc"
pugs,38sjc0,SimplyQuid,2,Sat Jun 6 17:11:10 2015 UTC,Neat

pugs,38sjc0,jasoncrab,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:44:23 2015 UTC,How is that PDP controller? It's either that or the Hori Fight Commander. I've heard some weird things about the PDP though.
pugs,38sjc0,jasoncrab,2,Sat Jun 6 18:47:54 2015 UTC,"I loved it while it lasted, but the X button wore out on me already. It only works about 70% of the time when tapped. I have to really mash it to get 100% use. Oh well. Pug still works!"
pugs,38r7im,sedated_Meow_healer,3,Sat Jun 6 03:05:55 2015 UTC,Haha that expression!
pugs,38r7im,pigglypuffdrea,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:34:58 2015 UTC,Good dog.
pugs,38ornl,tragicfun,7,Fri Jun 5 16:34:06 2015 UTC,Awww he's all tiny.
pugs,38ornl,netherminde,6,Fri Jun 5 17:56:06 2015 UTC,And sweatery!
pugs,38ornl,Frozty23,5,Fri Jun 5 19:02:22 2015 UTC,Suspicious pug... Wondering if you really meant it when you said he's a good boy.
pugs,38ornl,kookiemnstr,3,Sat Jun 6 04:16:33 2015 UTC,Too much
pugs,38ornl,HandMeMyThinkingPipe,2,Fri Jun 5 17:18:21 2015 UTC,Hello puggy!
pugs,38ornl,aldesuda,2,Fri Jun 5 18:15:04 2015 UTC,That's a very skeptical pug.
pugs,38ornl,TroubleEntendre,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:01:15 2015 UTC,The look on his face tho
pugs,38ornl,COYAD,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:26:38 2015 UTC,yes work the camera!
pugs,38ornl,puglova,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:36:47 2015 UTC,God damnit.  Puppy + puppy sized sweater.    OP is cheating.
