You can smith staircases, hangers , even jewelry , from Damascus.  learning to make knives is also a good skill, but its focused on one subject.  i would take the Damascus course to get a feel for machines and general smithing techniques first, then go for the knife making course   edit: also take a course in woodworking if you dont know how to work wood or wanna learn advaced stuff. the Handles is a part of the knife"

knives,3e3x5a,sprinklydonut,2,Tue Jul 21 19:36:30 2015 UTC,"All you really need to know about knife grinds is this: ""Thinner cuts better"". That applies to the spine, but more importantly to all points behind the edge."
knives,3e3x5a,accountonphone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not too much of a steel snob, but S30V and VG-10 are my favorite stainless steels thus far. High Carbon on my scandinavian fixed blades are always great. I use Lauri blanks. I am getting to know a knife in S90V currently. Full-Flat-Grind (FFG) blades make great slicers. Saber grinds are more rigid (hard use appropriate?). Hollow grind would make an even better slicer than FFG (it is what straight razors use). There are volumes of information on steel and grinds and blade profiles and heat treating. I'm no expert."
knives,3e3x5a,nreyes238,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:18:06 2015 UTC,"Grinds are pretty simple - thin is for cutting, thick is for strength. Different uses require different combinations of these attributes, so there are dozens of different grinds available to meet these needs.  For example, a deep-bellied knife can have a reasonably thick spine, but still have a thin edge. However, it can be hard to get it into small spaces, or to make it into a folding knife that is convenient to carry, so you might go with a hollow grind instead, but that can make the edge frail and it will break if it's used for chopping. Every blade shape is a compromise for the intended use.  As for steel, there is bad steel, decent steel, and fancy steel. Decent steel is just fine for most uses, really. Fancy steel might hold a slightly better edge or hold a it longer, at the cost of being a bit more stubborn to resharpen. Some steels are more rust resistant or more crack resistant but in most cases the practical differences are fairly small. Very few people can tell different steels apart just by using a knife.  Keep in mind that any steel is only as good as the temper, and furthermore, the desirable properties of the steel need to be matched to the grind. A steel that excels in holding a fine edge is wasted on a thick-bladed chopper. There is no One Good Steel or One Good Grind any more than there is One Good Car."

knives,3e3385,fiskedyret,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:17 2015 UTC,"My hesitation is all of the talk of getting that ""grail"" 20 degree bevel. I basically use the sound of the stone to match whatever bevel is already on the knife. Maybe it makes more sense to get one of the Gatco/Lansky systems that will put a 20 degree bevel, then use the stones for final sharpening."
knives,3e3385,fiskedyret,3,Tue Jul 21 20:32:56 2015 UTC,"if you are anywhere near half decent at freehand sharpening, then the 20 degree bevel doesn't matter all that much. the only thing that matters is that the knife cuts the way you want it to, if it doesn't the all you have to to is lower the spine a bit and sharpen at that angle. systems like the lansky can't keep an even bevel along the entire length of the knife and the angle will also be affected by the width of the knife. if you aren't sure you're hitting the entire bevel of the knife, then use the sharpie trick to see what part of the bevel you're hitting."
knives,3e3385,accountonphone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:38:42 2015 UTC,"There is nothing special about 20 degrees at all. In fact many would argue that 20 degrees per side is far too steep for the vast majority of knives. One of the benefits of freehand sharpening is that it relieves you of the angle restrictions of the set angle systems, which in turn allows you to optimize the cutting performance of your knives rather than simply accept and use the obtuse factory grinds."

knives,3e3nkd,alfredbordenismyname,0,Tue Jul 21 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"i can't say anything about the company but D2 tool steel is a very good knife steel, for the right applications. D2 is a very hard steel, it's the kind of steel they use to cut and form other hard steels in industrial manufacturing.   it takes a good fine edge and holds it for a long time, even through hard use. but on the other side of that is when you do have to sharpen it, it will take a fair amount of elbow grease to get the job done (but the quality of edge retention means you won't have to do it too often).    now, on the down side, because of how hard it is it can be brittle under certain circumstances. with improper use, instead of curling the edge over and having to remove the material with a file and putting an edge back on it (losing only a small portion of the overall cutting edge during reprofiling), it can chip whole pieces off, or worse. the knife won't be useless but you will likely have to drastically redesign the blade profile to fix whatever damage has happened.  not a deal breaker by any means, just don't be foolish with it by throwing it around, dropping it, or sinking it into a log and sharply twisting or bending it. just proper knife use in general and this knife will likely out last you."

knives,3dzbzk,NOT_ENUFF_LUBE,12,Mon Jul 20 20:20:50 2015 UTC,"Actually this was one of the most frustrating parts about buying the Sebenza for me, there are very few comprehensive comparisons out there. I couldn't decide until (fortunately) I found a local store nearby that had both knives in stock.  There are strengths and weaknesses of each knife. I know a lot of the details of the 940 after carrying one for 5 years. Unfortunately I've only had my Sebenza for about a week so I cant offer as in depth an analysis of it as the 940. One big note is that they use the same steel (the new sebenzas use S35 instead of S30 which is supposedly stronger, but manufactured the same way).  With that said, here's my take:  940  Strengths:   The blade is weighted perfectly to how much the axis lock holds it back. The best out of any benchmade I've handled. There's no way it'll open in your pocket, but deploys with speed and ease.  Crazy long cutting edge for its profile. It totally breaks convention for length vs width, but pulls it off gracefully. The blade is thick enough to pry with. It's got enough backbone to handle using unconventionally. Purple and green is my favorite color combination and it's damn sexy Will hold a razor-sharp edge through months of heavy use.   Weaknesses:   Over time, due to the high amount of force it generates when being closed, the edge of the blade will start to hit the titanium spacer, dulling it right where the blade curves. No on-blade jimping means if you want to put a lot of force behind it you're forced to put your thumb on the back of the blade. It's not very comfortable. I cannot stress this one enough. A 940 is a great EDC but for more delicate tasks like carving it can seriously hurt your hand. Over time my 940 wore down the washers and the blade started to wiggle, my Sebenza may do this as well, but just an over-time observation. The aluminum scales scratch really easily. It will start looking beat up very fast The handle is so narrow that closing it with the axis lock is slightly terrifying. I have relatively small hands for a guy and the blade came way too close for comfort to my knuckles every time. The blade is a little to thick for precision slicing   Sebenza  Strengths:   The jimping is quite literally perfect. I can now dig deep into wood I'm carving and not have to worry about hurting my hands. This also allows for a higher degree of precision in intricate carvings (I like to carve fleur-de-lis-esque carvings into walking sticks for myself and friends). The hollow grind allows for precise slicing (i.e. meats, fruits, etc) The clearance off the spacer is huge, eliminating my worry that it will eventually hit and dull itself. It is much more precise in it's movement and feel. If you have the opportunity to go down to a store that carries both you'll understand. When the Sebenza is open it feels like a fixed blade knife. The Benchmade 940, while solid, feels like it's comprised of separate entities when sitting next to a Sebenza.   Weaknesses:   The blade just doesn't feel thick enough to pry with. It feels a way more delicate in hand. Very slow deployment. It can be easily opened and closed with one hand, but not with the same ease as a 940. Very plain in style, if you want to impress your friends this one looks like ""just another knife"". People wont understand.   Comparison  In comparison, the 940 is an extremely sturdy knife if you plan on being in situations where you need the prying power and a blade that is thicker and more sturdy in general.   However, the Sebenza is a step above in every other category in my opinion. It feels much better in hand. The blade feels like an extension of the handle and vice versa. When open it's the closest to a fixed-blade feel in any folder I've experienced. The 940 feels like separate pieces.  The 940 is also a wonderful knife and served me well for years working up at Boy Scout Camp. If I still worked there there is no way in hell I would've gotten a Sebenza. I needed to pry, use my knife as a screwdriver, and do all sorts of heavy duty tasks with it. However, I now work in an office as a software developer and don't need that level of utility anymore, so a graceful knife that's better at intricate use fits much better for me.   Sorry for the long comparison. Hope that helps!  TL;DR The 940 is an imprecise heavy-duty workhorse while the Sebenza is a precise knife good for more detailed work"
knives,3dzbzk,Bohemous,5,Mon Jul 20 20:56:59 2015 UTC,"Imo the Simple look of the sebenza is one of the best parts. Why would you want something flashy? I buy knives for practicality.

knives,3dzbzk,fadugleman,3,Tue Jul 21 00:29:41 2015 UTC,"I appreciate its simplicity too. My 940 had a polished silver blade with no serration and wasn't particularly eye catching to the untrained eye either. The Sebenza is great,  it's a no-nonsense knife.   However, when purchasing knives, looks and style is a heavy consideration for a lot of people. Take it from someone who's sold knives to people who couldn't tell a buck from a benchmade. Flashy a Sebenza is not. So I just thought I'd include that in the comparison."
knives,3dzbzk,cyclic_rival,4,Tue Jul 21 00:34:04 2015 UTC,Hey maybe you can answer a question I have. I've never owned a benchmade but my next knife purchase is gonna be in the more expensive/quality region. Obviously benchmade makes quality knives and I'm wondering how it compares (if at all) to spyderco. I know spyderco seems to mostly make good slicers. Hope I'm making sense. Basically im asking why do people choose benchmade and why do people choose spyderco.  Im only comparing these two because theyre amongst the more popular brands
knives,3dzbzk,theambulo,4,Tue Jul 21 00:39:50 2015 UTC,"That's like asking why some people choose to drive a BMW vs Mercedes. I can answer it, but there's a ton of opinion involved when discussing differences in comparable brands.  First of all, if you're moving from cheaper knives to the nicer ones you need to understand a few things about folders in general. First of is how the blade is ground. The two most common (and what you should be looking for) are flat grinds and hollow grinds. This is one of the largest factors slicing depends upon. A hollow grind will slice better, but isn't as sturdy as a flat grind and vice versa. See below:  Different grind types  Next is jimping. AKA the ribs on the back of the blade or handle that you put your thumb on. As I mentioned in my review the jimping on the 940 is on the handle, while the jimping on the Sebenza is on the blade. This also makes a world of difference. While handle-only jimping is generally sufficient. I tend to like jimping that is seamless between the handle and blade (allows for more precise use of the knife).  You can find examples of knife features that fit your needs in both brands, it really boils down to the individual knives and how they specifically fit your needs.  Now, the fun part of benchmade vs spyderco is the type of lock. In my opinion nothing beats an axis lock, not even my integrated lock on my Sebenza. You can pull the lever in the back down and make your blade completely loose, allowing you to open and close the knife with gravity alone. Spydercos typically feature a lockbar (your standard locking mechanism for knives).  At the end of the day it's all about how you personally plan on using the knife. If you PM me a few options and what you're planning on using it for I can help you narrow it down to a knife that will fit your needs. Or if you'd like some recommendations of my own. I'm more than happy to help."
knives,3dzbzk,patriotik,4,Tue Jul 21 00:51:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughtful and thorough response and congrats on your new knife. I have a 940-1 that I am currently getting to know. I'm worried that my S90V blade will not make a good pry bar like your S30V did. However, the CF scales are a bit thicker than the aluminum and the titanium spacer has a ton of clearance from the edge when closed so I think it should address some of what you mentioned as cons for the 940. Here's hoping that both of our new knives age well."
knives,3dzbzk,c3h8pro,4,Mon Jul 20 21:17:13 2015 UTC,"I got the chance to check out the CF scaled 940 when I was buying my Sebenza. I'm confident they solved the blade clearance issue with that knife and the handle felt a little better. I heavily considered the 940-1, those were actually the two out on the table when I made the decision, but the Sebenza just felt right.   I was worried at first using my 940 as a pry-bar as well, but Osborne blades are tanks.   I'm sure they'll both age fantastically. Really cant go wrong with either knife, at a certain point the differences become minor semantics in high-end knives."

I recently found an older benchmade 550 lying around and decided to clean it up(it had been used to gut several deer and was covered in unpleasant things. Given how extensive the dirt was I removed the blade to treat is separately from the handle. After cleaning, oiling, and reassembly, the action of opening the knife is extremely rough and stiff. I know that I fucked up in some way, but I can't seem to find any info about similar issues or fixes. Additionally, it has occurred to me that the screw holding the blade in place is too tight, but it seems to be stripped out and I can't remove it. What do you think the best course of action would be to fix the knife? it still locks out completely fine and is usable, but is very, very stiff. Thanks for any responses!"

knives,3dvqmz,Jeromefleet,0,Mon Jul 20 06:48:54 2015 UTC,"so? OP didn't lend him the knife. he found it, and had it for months. for those months, it was HIS knife. he can do whatever he wants with it. if you are of the opinion that he stole it, then asking him to pay for the scales is a pretty weak response. I just don't see it as appropriate. Either it was innocent and asking him to pay is ridiculous, or he stole it and OP should take a stronger stance."

I know they replace blades for $25 if it is NOT a warranty issue.  I bet they will replace the handles for you either free or for a small fee.  They probably have the best warranty in the business.

Especially if you're not trained in knife fighting. I'd suggest pepper spray or a bright ass flashlight that can double as a club. Im sure they make tactical flashlights. Something with a pointy end or two. Can temporarily blind someone with the light. That being said , go with a clip point or tanto. With a plain edge. Or serrations idc. If it's for a girl I'd get spring assist.   Can't go wrong with a good flashlight tho man."

With a spring assist or a liner/frame lock, you have a bit of push back to let you know you have a firm grip and you can close the knife by touch alone, I found myself always having to be extra careful closing and opening the griptillian to make sure I didn't screw up"

knives,3dutj6,Gromann,4,Sun Jul 19 23:41:21 2015 UTC,"My barrage has that satisfying feeling of force.  How the blade torques your wrist from the force of it opening.  As if the knife goes from carry to ""LETS CUT SOME SHIT!!!!"" mode."
knives,3dutj6,FullThrottleFRS,2,Mon Jul 20 00:27:46 2015 UTC,"I dunno, my Mini-grips still give me that ""LET'S CUT SOME SHIT"" mode feeling. I obviously don't get the torque feeling, but the geometry of the Axis lock, retaining the blade slightly when closed, provides a perfect amount of resistance for a super satisfying ""SNICK"" as I flip it open.   Still every bit as fast as assisted open knives I've handled, as just as satisfying in my opinion."
knives,3dutj6,Viddog4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:02:01 2015 UTC,I had a mini grip and full size griptillian before acquiring this one myself. It's not inconvenient at all. I found closing the previous knives still required a practiced flick and now it's just a different method (I generally Gently put the tip against my pants and push down not pushing the blade towards me but more the knife parallel downwards closing the blade) no harder no easier. However obviously opening is so much easier with the assisted.

Sorta the equivalent of ten years of hand wear.   Ganzo knives have rather stiff springs on the lock so I did what worked on my old Ganzo G704, I removed one. It still locks up fine and now has a soft feel that I prefer.   I put some FrogLube in the city with the lock return spring and put some gun oil on both pivot bearing washers.  I reassembled the knife and backed off the pivot screw so the blade will gravity open and close.   Then I stropped the blade and made the lanyard.  One thing I really like about this knife is that it only has three screws per side and they are all big and the same size.

I had a Kershaw Zing, a Rat 2, and even carried a Dragonfly 2 for a while.   Then I got a Ganzo G704 and loved the lock but it was big and heavy so I got a Sanrenmu LB-763 which has a similar blade and lock in a smaller package. But I was spoiled. After the G704, the LB-763 felt like a toy.   I went back to the G704 but there were a few things I thought could be better and this G717 seems to hit them. First the scales feel better to me. Second the G704  has a bunch of tiny Torx screws attaching the scales which are a bother and easy to strip. The G717 has only two screws in addition to the pivot screws per side and all of them are T8s. Beefy and I only need one tool. An added bonus is the rounded spine"

It's about the same size as a Spyderco Paramilitary but still has a full flat ground blade. I have the 7063 which I think is the same knife just a different number now.  How difficult was the lock to reassemble? I know they are far more difficult that just a pivot or torsen bar. How is the thickness for cary of the 717 and 704?

knives,3dziik,Badd_Karmaa,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:31 2015 UTC,"Grind it back to center. Once your steel is cooled it weakens it significantly to reheat and reshape it. Even bending out the waiver will weaken the steel. Your best bet is to grind the waiver out. You may end up with a little less knife than you bargained for, but it'll be much stronger that way."

knives,3dvsrn,crazzyazzy,2,Mon Jul 20 03:07:27 2015 UTC,Did that Ka-Bar get the serrations ground away??
knives,3dvsrn,T-Money93,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:24:23 2015 UTC,"You know they still make the straight edge, right?"
knives,3dvsrn,crazzyazzy,-1,Mon Jul 20 07:59:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know but look at the coating near the handle. It's not uniform and that's where the serrations are on the krayton handled Ka-Bar fighters. Not only that, but zoom in on the blade edge. Grind is different in that one section than the rest of the blade."
knives,3dvsrn,crazzyazzy,2,Mon Jul 20 08:32:03 2015 UTC,"It is the straight edge model, however I wasn't happy with the factory edge, it was extremely shallow. So I tried to re-profile it to around 20 degrees and I didn't do the worlds best job. Its sharper now and gets the job done I just mucked up the coating a bit."
knives,3dvsrn,crazzyazzy,2,Mon Jul 20 13:00:54 2015 UTC,Huh that's interesting. I wonder what the normal grind angle was.
knives,3dvsrn,T-Money93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:27:31 2015 UTC,The normal angle on the big Kabar is around 20 degrees. When they made the short model they kept the same blade stock thickness as the larger Kabar but drastically reduced the other dimensions. So in my opinion the edge angle on my short Kabar was around 30 degrees when i got it.
knives,3dvsrn,crazzyazzy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:08 2015 UTC,Ah interesting. I just reprofiled my BK7. Had lent it to a friend and he fucked it beyond belief. Took me about 3 hours with the Lanksy System but now it's got a nice 20° edge and I'm loving it.

knives,3dsugh,Smellydogfur,2,Sun Jul 19 17:20:16 2015 UTC,"Tanto is more difficult to sharpen because it had two different edges, instead of one.  It's not ""that bad"".   It is obviously more difficult though, and does not give any real advantage.  It reduces the total useable blade length.  I have no idea why you can't put an edge on a normal blade.. because it is easier.   That's a fact.   If it has a recurve that's another story -- that is more difficult."

As much as I love the santoku, I'd suggest going for the more traditional Gyuto (Japanese chef knife) as the pointed tip and length of the blade makes it more versatile to use compared to a santoku.   What kind of budget are you setting for yourself? if you only want to spend a tiny amount, that victorinox that /u/Austinist mentioned would be just fine, if you are willing to spend more, the possibilities and options become rather more grand."

knives,3dwrtn,cyberklown28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:44:58 2015 UTC,"Based on your favorable reply to a Victorinox, I'd add a Tojiro DP santoku or gyuto to my list. For $20-ish more for any given style and length, you get a better steel, better grind, and a more traditional (though not really better) handle.  For a home cook there's nothing wrong with picking a santoku over a chef knife or gyuto if you find their length and profile comfortable. You'd notice the lack of length most when working with large quantities of food, which is more common in a restaurant, or when slicing proteins."

I'm getting a manix but I Also wanted a nice budget knife for fun. Variety is the spice of life. Wanna try out another blade. I already have the tenacious btw.   Also thinking about the roadie but part of me doesn't wanna pay 50 bucks for a knife like that.

I re cut the bevel to 20 on my Lansky, and mirrored it out with my 6k King water stone. Still shaved arm hair.   I cut the tops off of boxes every day, and haven't re-sharpened in months. It's about the steel. I also think putting a great mirror on the edge helps, but I'm not sure. My M2HS Benchmade Ares also has no issue with boxes."

knives,3du4nv,sprinklydonut,4,Tue Jul 21 03:55:51 2015 UTC,I would go with the Benchmade Mini Onslaught. It has an extremely shallow bevel that will go through boxes all day.
knives,3du4nv,Alchoholocaustic,2,Sun Jul 19 22:08:36 2015 UTC,"I suggest looking for something with a thin spine and full flat grind or very high saber grind. These will go through cardboard with test resistance, more like a razor. Many spyderco designs fit the bill (chaparrel, caly 3, delica/endura 4). An opinel would be exceptional at this work and nice and easy to sharpen, but of course no serrations, no clip and 2 handed opening.   Keep in mind that nomatter what knife you get, using it daily for work means it will go dull regularly, so you will need to sharpen frequently. Take into account ease/time of sharpening in your system for any blade you decide on."
knives,3du4nv,accountonphone,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:11:34 2015 UTC,Delica 4 with combo edge would be perfect I think. FFG is awesome :)
knives,3du4nv,tehDemonseye,2,Sun Jul 19 23:28:43 2015 UTC,You want a Spyderco Manix 2.  The full flat grind slides through cardboard.  The leaf shape blade is especially good at piercing to start a cut.  The Axis style lock makes it super easy to open and close one handed when your hands are full.  I would advise against the combo blade as I don't think it helps with much and it's difficult to sharpen and you lose useful slicing surface.    Source:  I have worked in print shops and warehouses for a long time and have used many knives.  I cut cardboard and nylon straps all the time.  The Manix 2 was a revelation.
knives,3du4nv,konzy27,2,Sun Jul 19 23:53:23 2015 UTC,Gerber EAB or something similar. Disposable razor blades are great for cuttingboxes.

I won't bore you with all of them. The biggest cons are the wear on my pocket and the speed at which your knife dulls fighting boxes. The biggest pro ican think of right now is the ease of use. The wear I on my pants is what killed it for me, my pocket would wear out in two months from the g10 of the m21. My solution was to carry a fixed blade morakniv bushcraft (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B009O01H0Y/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?qid=1437344030&sr=8-2&pi=AC_SX200_QL40&keywords=morakniv+bushcraft&dpPl=1&dpID=318sRSIdo7L&ref=plSrch), it'll hold an edge all week with moderate to extreme use and wont wear out my jeans unless I stab myself in the leg trying to put it away.

knives,3dt3wm,Ulferor,2,Sun Jul 19 07:03:09 2015 UTC,Jasco paint and epoxy remover. Buy it at most hardware stores. Then after the blade is clean you can force a patina with warm vinegar or mustard.

knives,3dso5h,FullThrottleFRS,3,Sun Jul 19 02:03:04 2015 UTC,"My old and new EDC knives. Obviously both Benchmade Mini-Griptilians. The old one wasn't very old, maybe about a month. I got the Doug Ritter Mini RSK Mk1 in the mail today, very fast shipping. Decided that I thought the scales would look better reversed, so I swapped them.  Like I said, I got the first one about a month ago. I wanted to start carrying a knife for my job out on a road construction project, so I looked into good folding knives, as I'm all educated and have a well paying job now. The mini grip seemed to be what I was looking for, so I checked out if my local outdoor/sporting goods store had any. They only had this one; OD green handle, black serrated MDP blade in 154CM. I really liked how it felt in person, so I bought it.  At the time, I already knew I didn't really want serrations, but went with what they had in stock versus ordering online. It was a good thing I did, as the next day I actually had a couple good uses for the knife throughout the day. Had I ordered online, I would have been wishing I had bought this one.  But I still didn't like the serrations. So I looked into ordering a custom version from Benchmade. I was going to upgrade the steel to S30v, as I have a fixed blade hunting knife that uses it, and I'm really happy with that. I waffled on the decision for a week or so, and was about to buy it, even had it in the shopping cart. Decided to take one more look for other mini grips online with upgraded steel, and stumbled upon the mini RSK Mk1. I read up a bit and found M390 seems to be comparable to S30v, so for $10 cheaper than the custom S30v version, and a nicer looking blade profile and finish, it was a no brainer.  Overall I'm very happy, both are extremely smooth and well built. These will be knives that last me a long time. I know a lot of people get the blade bug and can't stop buying knives, but I really don't think I'd change anything from this mini RSK Mk1, so my wallet should be safe."

I'm guessing they still might charge you as you blade is decent but my point is the voided warranty is a gray area.   Edit: they'll also send you deep carry clips for free if you ask them via there website. I asked on my warranty form and didn't get one but asked again after I got it back and had one within the week"

Their attributes vary, it may wear fast and cut fine or be extremely hard and difficult to coax into releasing fresh abrasive - you may have to get creative to make sure it cuts at a reasonable speed.  For around 20 bucks you can pick up a norton india or norton crystalon combination stone on Amazon, more consistent stones that are known to work well - used extensively by butchers etc. Lubricate with honing oil or mineral oil/wd40.  A little more expensive you can get a smiths diamond stone instead.   For around 30 bucks you can usually find a lansky deluxe kit or crockstick kit."

knives,3drp66,SovietCorgiFromSpace,2,Sat Jul 18 20:27:56 2015 UTC,The hole for the pivot screw probably isn't deep enough/even/plumb/flush for the screw so you can't seat the screw properly.

knives,3drp66,crazzyazzy,2,Sat Jul 18 20:56:46 2015 UTC,Np. You're probably going to need to use a larger drill bit to bore out space for the screw head so that the head can seat more flush. I'd use a drill press if you have it and go slow and constantly check it.

The latch did not close properly. it would sit on the edge and slip off when I put the slightest pressure on and part. So I returned it. I was sad. I went through the five stages of grief. I wallowed in my own self pity. But the I saw the light. I went the blade hq online and found it. The one. The beautiful Benchmade Special 51. In blue and black. I immediately fell in love. So I bought it. And on Thursday, the second most love of my hands came in the mail. So here she is. My new baby( part 2)."

Super tight lockup with no play whatsoever, and feels really strong. In the closed position, it provides enough resistance to keep from flipping open in my pocket, but it's light enough where a light flick on the thumb stud opens the knife incredibly smooth and fast to a full lockup. Closing the knife is really easy as well, just pull the button and a slight wrist flick followed by releasing the button and its closed. Overall very fun to absentmindedly flick open and closed when I'm bored; that's not to say it's gimmicky, just works very well and is satisfying to open and close. I have no desire to buy any frame/liner lock, Axis is king in my opinion. Safe, smooth, solid, and sexy."

They're also finished by Todd Rexford so you are paying a little more to have something that he's actually worked on (and fit/finish is superb - which it ought to be for the $).

knives,3dgfhj,IlllllIIlllIIllIIIII,4,Thu Jul 16 02:43:43 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm not sure because it was a complete surprise from my folks.  My father and I had a conversation about them a few weeks back but they picked everything out.
knives,3dgfhj,IlllllIIlllIIllIIIII,10,Thu Jul 16 02:47:06 2015 UTC,"No, I mean the patent."
knives,3dgfhj,edman400,16,Thu Jul 16 03:12:27 2015 UTC,Ah sorry.    The patent was filed through my employer so I'm not sure how much it runs but I would imagine it is fairly expensive especially with the legal support we receive.  I'm an engineer for an automotive OEM in the crash safety department and they are always pushing us to get patents.  I've applied for 10 and this was my first to go through (also the first I applied for).
knives,3dgfhj,edman400,4,Thu Jul 16 03:21:26 2015 UTC,What did you patent? Just curious

This was my first application and I've submitted 9 behind it is what I should have said. Once we apply it takes a year and a half or more for the patent office to approve them. Sorry for the confusion.
knives,3dgfhj,WyattDerpp,2,Thu Jul 16 13:15:06 2015 UTC,I'm still confused have you sent off for 10 but so far only had one go through?
knives,3dgfhj,mijazma,4,Thu Jul 16 14:19:49 2015 UTC,Yup. The one that was just approved by the patent office I submitted a little over two years ago.  There is still 9 in the queue that still need to be evaluated. It takes them awhile because they have to check the application to previously submitted patents and decide if it's an actually patentable design.

If texas allows autos and you want one, the new kershaw launch series look pretty incredible with a nice 154 steel and made in usa.   Spyderco doesnt have assisted knives for all I know, I could be wrong. And their knives look pretty funky at first but their beauty is in their function. Theyre mostly light weight, and easy to use. The delica, and endura come to mind as well as the dragonfly, cat, chicago, sage, and chapparel or something like that. Theyre all around the blade size you mentioned, although the endura is not, not even close. Also none are assisted."

One of the biggest advantages of the Scandi is that it's so easy to sharpen because the edge is so large and flat. This seems like it would negate that advantage, but still leave a big giant edge exposed to rust."

I assume it's aftermarket?  And I don't know how to say this, but I'm passably familiar with the Masakage lines and I don't think that's a Kiri. The Kiri's finish is a suminagashi pattern that covers the entire blade face  and VG-10 doesn't tend to have that level of contrast when used as a core steel. I would bet money that's a Masakage Yuki."

My first mod was acid etching the blade, then I replaced the zytel handles with custom G10 scales, I ordered a custom titanium clip to replace the factory one which I found to be kinda meh, I stonewashed the frame/liner, and finally, I bronzed the screws and standoffs.

A traditional camp knife would be something that is very bad at brush clearing because it would be much shorter so you could never generate the blade speed that you could with a machete and you'd have a short reach so you'd have to bend down alot and get very close to the brush where youd subject your hand to getting hit with thorns or whatever's in the brush etc.  I've seen others recommend you the junglas, which is not a true machete because it is thicker and heavier, making it sort of a hybrid which is geared more towards heavier chopping and wood splitting. There are many other options that are similar. Something like that would be better for brush clearing than a smaller camp knife, but will be worse for brush clearing than the lighter weight machetes which you can swing much faster.   Not sure what you mean by bushcraft activities besides clearing brush, but it will likely require a second blade. If you mean mostly precise wood carving type uses, then the mora is sort of the performance standard. If you mean prying and hammering your blade into wood and other materials, the esee or becker lines may be up your alley. If you mean cleaning small game and fish, something like the schrade old timer sharpfinger would work well."

knives,3di638,Other_accountant,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:02:34 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a job for a machete or Bowie knife, neither of which I know much about. If you want something durable (and amazing quality for its price) and incredibly light, the S&W Border Guard excels in both fields. Mine has lasted years through rain, sleet, and mud, and is still in excellent condition, aside from scars and scratches, though I doubt it would be any use for heavy brush and shrubbery, it works great as a utility knife if you're carrying it over long periods of time, and limited to what you can carry."
knives,3di638,Alchoholocaustic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:46:10 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you are the price varies, but a KA-BAR USMC will last you a lifetime for general bushcraft. It's not big enough for clearing brush though, for that you'll need a machete. Ontario and Cold steel make some nice ones.  If you're totally broke get a Mora. Good knives for light duty work and food preparation in the bush."

Get a machete for clearing brush.   Some one suggested the esee junglas which is good, but expensive.  For bushcraft,  my first recommendation is the tops B.O.B.. There are a few others too.  Esee 3, Benchmade bushcrafter, white river gti 4.5.  If you are on a budget   I'd go with condor knife and tool.  You can get a solid knife and machete for 150 $US or so.

These systems allow you to put a uniform angle on the edge. Makes things so easy even I can do it. Every knife i've put through my Lansky has come out shaving sharp. Watch youtube videos before you try it.

They're both useless, and the karambit will get you arrested if a cop decides to search you while you have it. Just get something normal that you can use for regular EDC stuff.

knives,3dg5h6,tdotnrd,5,Thu Jul 16 00:52:53 2015 UTC,"A karambit is perfectly legal in Canada.  Don't ever say it's for defense or for harming someone or for any crime though.  That'll get you into some shit in Canada.  But if you got a karambit on you and you say it's for opening boxes that's fine.  Tool, not weapon.  I would not recommend the karambit anyhow.  I don't like 'em."
knives,3dg5h6,Silverlight42,5,Thu Jul 16 02:09:19 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the ultimate arbiters of what is a weapon and what is a tool in Canada are police officers and judges. Most karambits, especially the sort that a 14 year old kid who is also interested in balisongs is likely to buy, are pretty clearly intended as weapons, regardless of how many boxes the OP is claiming he's opening - especially if he's out hanging around a park or a mall or doing other things teenagers do. If an officer judges that OP's karambit is designed or intended to harm or injure a person, OP is in for a world of pain with a weapons charge on his record. It's not even close to being worth the risk for the reward of carrying around a goofy impractical knife."

For Canada, a bit.  Give me some more info to work with.  I like getting blades with different profiles and blade steels and materials that I don't have in my other knives.  That's how I like to collect.  Or I go with a certain custom maker (though generally that's way above $80).  When I was 13 or so, I had crap knives.  First knife I bought for myself was when I was 18, and it was a Gerber Gator.  I was decent at sharpening at that point, but learnt more, sharpened more.  I suggest you also get into doing that.  It's an important part if you use your knives.  Don't get a karambit.     Don't ever tell anyone your knives are for defense or for a crime or hurting anyone.  against the law here, just saying the words can get you into trouble.  It's a tool, never a weapon."

knives,3dg5h6,Al_X,4,Thu Jul 16 00:46:23 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing with ""exotic"" knives....unless they're the high-end, custom made types (read that as way more than $80) they are pretty much useless for anything but display.  Now, it's none of my business what people want to collect.....but those ""exotic"" knives you see sold in malls & flea markets really have no collectible value....likewise they have no value as a functional knife.  I have a small collection...maybe 12-15 different knives.  You know what one of my favorite knives that I regularly carry is?  It's an antique ""Kamp King"" scout knife from the 50's-60's that I paid $10 for in an antique store.  It's not very valuable but it is collectible, and pretty decent knife for what it is.  If you currently have a simple metal folder and a box cutter (nothing wrong with either one, they both serve a purpose)......why not start a collection that you will be proud of for years and possibly even pass on to your kids some day?  Something like a Buck 110 is a well made, iconic knife that you can carry every day and will last you a lifetime.  Or something like a Victorinox Swiss Army knife in the Cadet or Pioneer models?  Quality and functionality.  Or...if you want to start getting into outdoors & bushcraft....you can't go wrong with a Mora, as /u/steamBommer29 previously mentioned.  Any of these will make a fine foundation for a knife collection that will serve you well and last you a very long time.  Ultimately, it is your money....and your decision.  Buy what will make you happy.  However......I think once you hold a $40 Buck or Victorinox....or even a $20 Mora......and you see the kind of quality you get for the money....versus some fancy-looking fantasy knife......I think you'll see what we're getting at.  I have two Moras that I paid less than $20 each for....and you could shave with them out of the box."
knives,3dg5h6,StandForMe,3,Thu Jul 16 01:20:31 2015 UTC,I'd say get a mora for when you need a fixed blade and get an Opinel of a Swiss army knife for an EDC Folder. They're not very expensive but are all good quality knives.

knives,3dg3sx,Silverlight42,6,Thu Jul 16 21:04:41 2015 UTC,"with the intent to harm someone   This is the important bit.  It's the same in Canada.  Don't ever say it's for defense or protection.  Your knife is a tool not a weapon.  You open boxes, hunting, whatever.  Some utility function.  Also make sure it's visible and if an officer ever asks you, you declare that you have a knife on your person.   It's much less hassle if it's not concealed pretty much everywhere.  Those knife laws are pretty decent if that's all there is.  Might as well be on the safer side of things, unless you absolutely need to -- but I personally don't think there's really a need to conceal carry a knife.  As for how the law defines a bowie knife... well chances are that'll be up for the courts to decide if an officer decides to arrest you and the DA charges you with it.  A KA-BAR I could see them misconstruing that as one.  It is not, but again -- up to the officer first, then the courts.  Avoid trouble, don't conceal carry and never say it's for protection or anything that can possibly mean harm to someone.  Opening boxes, skinning deer."

Don't buy the pull through sharpener, it might be cheap, but anything else will be better.

knives,3dblc3,sprinklydonut,2,Wed Jul 15 04:30:23 2015 UTC,Just a really nice little pen knife. It was designed in 2013 when the TSA announced a plan to change their rules and allow knives on planes again after 9/11. The plan was later withdrawn but in the meantime Spyderco had designed this as an option to have a decent little blade that would be accepted under the new rule.  The blade is a high quality stainless (N690Co) with a wide profile and a full-flat grind so it's quality steel and a really nice edge that is easy to maintain and is super sharp out of the box. Maintains an edge really nicely and is super sturdy with the overall thickness of the blade.  The finger choil at the base of the blade gives a lot of control and grip on the knife considering the small size of it. I have large hands and with my index finger on the choil the handle ends at my ring finger but doesn't seem small or delicate at all.   I also just really like the aesthetics of the design.
knives,3dblc3,carramrod,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:31:43 2015 UTC,"For a small non-locking knife its solid, and the SLIPIT joint does a good job of not feeling like its gonna fold up every time you use it. The wide profile of the blade is nice also."

I've also never experienced cramping, though I'm not usually using it for super heavy duty stuff where I'm gripping it tightly for extended periods. That being said, if I were to have a need for heavy duty use often, I can see where a larger knife would be better. For my personal use, it's great.  It's my first ""good"" knife that I've bought for EDC, and it has me satisfied. I've looked through the current catalog of all of the major brands, and nothing appeals to me like it does. First and foremost, the Axis lock is, in my opinion, unmatched by anything else I've seen. It's also one of the smallest Axis locks out there, without making sacrifices like the Valet does. Anything similar to the Axis lock from other companies is too big for me to want for EDC.  It's pretty much ended my search for a quality EDC knife, I only plan on buying another one from Benchmade's custom shop to be exactly my preference. I only bought this configuration because it was the only one available at my local shop. The one I'll order will have a raw S30v sheepsfoot blade, no serrations, and black scales. Then I'll be ordering a deep carry clip, because the stock clips don't appeal to me much."

""as a tactical officer in the field he had no equal"" (of bombing or weapons) done or for use in immediate support of military or naval operations.   Paramilitary means ""unofficial military force""  In layman's terms, the Spyderco Paramilitary 2 is a tactical knife because it's name and design lend itself to being a combat weapon."

knives,3dcjyi,trap_clap,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:11:57 2015 UTC,"It's a perfectly suitable EDC tool. But its name and design suggest combat. Like an AR-15 for hunting or target shooting.

knives,3dcjyi,Soggy_Pud,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:32:08 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're ordering from amazon, the aluminum version is only 8 dollars more than the Tanto serated glass filled nylon handle version ($38 vs. $46). I would just spring for the straight edge aluminum version..and even though they're the same weight, a metal handle always just feels better to me than plastic or G10. If you get the nylon tanto version you will also get the serated edge...something I'm not a fan of. The straight edge nylon model is even less at $30, but you won't get the black-coated blade of the aluminum ""sport"" model. It is a very balanced feeling knife in hand & is a substantial feeling liner lock for $45 so I recommend going for the aluminum before they're all gone, as they have been discontinued.  I have never owned another CRKT knife but I hear the hei-ho, ripple, and swindle are quality blades. I think the Shenanigan is the coolest looking, though. While it is definitely one of CRKT's less flashy & more subdued looking style of knife, it was very well done in my opinion. I sold my kershaw leek because ive been exclusively carrying my shenanigan since I got it."

I know you said you don't like lockbacks, and I don't really either but it's really not that big of a deal.  Again I don't really know that much about Spydercos, so hopefully someone else can chime in.   I feel far more comfortable using my mini Griptilian with a sheepsfoot blade when I have to use the tip hard, like for prying. You may want to consider one of those."

knives,3dcf7p,blitz331,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:55:16 2015 UTC,"It's a great user knife.   The steel is good for edc knives. Steel controversy stems from so many people buying into the hype of ""super steels"", but it is just that... hype. I won't get into it fully, but most of what you hear about how much better one steel is over another is based in cognitive bias imo. Sure there are some benefits of some of the modern stainless varieties, but for a user blade, the differences aren't nearly what they are made out to be, and often aren't worth the price difference for pure use. Spydercos heat treatment and quality control is good so you don't have to worry about damage from normal use and their 8cr13 will hold it's edge well when properly sharpened. It is technically stainless, but it will rust if it is left wet for an extended period.  The design is good. Smooth action, easily accessible one handed, reasonably comfortable grip (not really suited to long hard use from ergo standpoint, most edc blades aren't), good traction, simple to take apart and reassemble, reasonably thin blade grind suiting it well for slicing tasks etc. The liner lock is quite thick and strong compared to many, and the lockup is great and will last many years of daily use."

It's an easy transition from a Benchmade with the axis style lock (though admittedly not as smooth as the axis).  That leaf shape blade is a beast.

knives,3dbjk5,LouRedwood,3,Wed Jul 15 00:11:11 2015 UTC,"I hope someone has tried the Messermeister stones. I see them sometimes in restaurant supply stores an on knife trucks but have never used them.  What's your budget and what are you sharpening? It's a lot easier to learn how to sharpen on good or even great stones, so spending as much as is comfortable can help a beginner. I try to convince new sharpeners to start with one excellent stone, like a Shapton Pro 1.5k, a Bester 1k, or a Naniwa Professional 1k, and then buy other more costly stones to compliment it once that stone is giving them good results. When your edges off a 1k stone are better than most out of the box edges, your edges off a 5k stone will be exceptional.  There are some good combo stones too. Look into Gesshin and Suehiro. I don't like the King combo stone much for beginners, though the stones are good individually, and again haven't tried the Messermeister."
knives,3dbjk5,UncannyGodot,2,Wed Jul 15 04:36:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't been able to find a decent review on the Messermeister stones.   As for my budget, I am willing to spend more on decent stones that work rather than spending less on a product that doesn't work as advertised, but I didn't want to spend a fortune on my first stones because I do not have much experience. Although, I am willing to buy decent stones first if that is the better way to go.  As for the knives, I have a few Shuns that I typically use, but I also want to be able to sharpen the rest of the more common knives in my kitchen. I also plan on investing in a few more higher end Japanese knives in the future. So I would like to go ahead and try to learn to use the stones.   I have used electric sharpeners and grinding wheels (not a good idea I found out), but I feel I can get more out of the stones with less damage to my blades."
knives,3dbjk5,UncannyGodot,3,Wed Jul 15 04:45:57 2015 UTC,"There's nothing technically wrong with a less costly option, like King's 1k/6k. Many talented sharpeners have started there. But if you have any expectation of moving on to other stones later, just buy those instead. They are a much easier learning platform and are just a easy to own and use.  For reference, a few options. Bester's 1k or 1.2k with a Suehiro Rika 5k. Both are medium hardness soaking stones. The Bester is quite fast and the Suehiro provides one of the most effective edges you can get in a kitchen knife. Shapton's Pro 1k or 1.5k and their 5k. These are harder stones that do not need to be soaked. The 1k works faster, but the 1.5k leaves a particularly nice finish for softer European and American knives. Because they are harder and don't produce a lot of mud you need more consistent angles to get good results out of them. They're a little harder for a beginner, probably on par with some budget stones, but you will never grow out of them.  Shun's knives don't need any special attention in terms of stone selection, so whatever you buy for them will be fine for your other knives too."

knives,3d4ze0,MeatCurtainRod,8,Tue Jul 14 15:46:45 2015 UTC,Meh.  To me it looks like he's twirling a pencil around his fingers.  That is a very dangerous move.  FYI a traditional butterfly knife has a one sided blade and is ALWAYS swung around blade facing backwards.  You aren't doing this and will risk getting cut.  And cutting yourself is not cool.
knives,3d4ze0,Ahandgesture,9,Mon Jul 13 21:28:31 2015 UTC,"Not always. There are tricks with the butterfly knife where you have the blade coming toward your fingers. ""Around the world"" for example has a twirl in it where you rotate the inside of the bite handle around your index finger. Screwing up the execution of that can definitely ruin your day."
knives,3d4ze0,flukshun,2,Mon Jul 13 21:42:37 2015 UTC,and then you have guys like me who tried that trick next to a friend and sent the knife whirling past their face.  stay safe folks.
knives,3d4ze0,outphase84,3,Mon Jul 13 23:02:58 2015 UTC,Not true. Quite a few tricks require bite handle first. Just requires practice and muscle memory.
knives,3d4ze0,Acefighter66,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:01:15 2015 UTC,"As an avid flipper, balisongs very frequently use bite handle situations where the possibility of being cut are very real. Keep your blade sharp, and it's rarely more than a few minutes of sucking your finger and a band-aid to fix the problem. Primarily though, when practicing new knife tricks you should tape the blade."
knives,3d4ze0,ocxtitan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:40:33 2015 UTC,"Meh, I think you could get this down pat pretty quickly. Practice the flip with the blade closed, then do it slowly with it open, graduate speed and it's relatively safe with experience. Muscle memory really."

knives,3d4ze0,ImNotM4Dbr0,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:07:39 2015 UTC,Well g10 is more expensive to manufacture and overall a better material. All g10 versions of Spyderco knives cost a lot more but it's for a good reason. The g10 Endura's liners are even a different shape and that adds to cost since they can't just use the same liners as the frn version. I like my Enduras but g10 feels better an a g10 endura would replace them.
knives,3d4ze0,AllFactsRedacted,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:02:26 2015 UTC,"My point wasn't that there is a price hike, but how much of a hike it is. The difference in price is the same as a persistence (also with steel liners and G10 scales) costs."
knives,3d4ze0,ImNotM4Dbr0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:02:36 2015 UTC,"Because it's a pretty much different manufacturing process, if they were using the same liners and just slapping g10 on top I'm sure the hike wouldn't be so high.

So yeah, it can be hard on your fingers but only if you go at it like crazy. Even then, the skin will toughen up and it won't be a bother.  Even so, having bought many more knives since I still find the hole completely superior to any stud I've used.

Have you looked at the ESEE Candiru? I think it is 5 and an eighth.

I would probably still suggest ESEE, especially the ESEE Izula and the ESEE 3, as they are easily concealable, look good, and are tough and made for use.

knives,3d97px,secpol,2,Tue Jul 14 14:14:18 2015 UTC,"Not 100% sure what you're asking for, since as far as SAK's go, it's fairly easy to figure out what you want. You've narrowed it down to an ALOX model (good choice!) so you have even less variety to sift through. Simply pick the model with the toolset that most appeals to you and your needs. You really can't go wrong with a Victorinox SAK and it will serve you well for many years to come...it may even outlast you :P I personally really like the Electrician (sheepsfoot blade instead of can opener), but any ALOX model based on the pioneer will serve you very well as long as you like the set of tools. Most people would probably go for the pioneer or the farmer I think."

The only problem is, where to buy them here in Europe online with not so sky-high shipping costs.

knives,3d8vmz,AngraMelo,2,Tue Jul 14 12:25:48 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest a mora companion for camping, but I doubt it'd skin game well. Maybe a buck 679? I use a hatchet I picked up from home hardware (or home depot? can never remember) a couple years ago, it's a benchmark and works well. It cost me ~$30 or so. The buck 679 is $45-$50 I think (I bought mine on clearance without a sheath, so got a nice deal) and a mora companion will run you about $20."
knives,3d8vmz,eleventytwelv,2,Tue Jul 14 19:08:38 2015 UTC,"I've skinned several deer with a Mora. Works just fine. Sure, it's not the ideal knife, but if you just want a decent ""ourdoors"" knife then it is a great multipurpose blade."

knives,3d8vmz,Sa91surfnerd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:03:53 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with my Fiskars hatchet and a mora. If you want to upgrade from the Mora to something that is a good outdoorsy knife and can skin game, take a look at the Becker 16. I haven't put many miles on it yet so I can't completely recommend it, but I like it so far. The blade shape of the BK 16 is a little more conducive to skinning than the mora's. The sheath sucks though. At least, it's not my cup of tea.  If you want to spend more money on a hatchet, the brand that tends to get thrown around as the next step up in quality would probably be wetterlings. I don't have one, but I much prefer their styling over the fiskars modern composite look. Each to his own however.   Good luck!"
knives,3d8vmz,happycamper374,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:08:39 2015 UTC,A really good value for axes is the Estwing brand.  They can often be found at Home Depot type stores.
knives,3d8vmz,psychicspy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:47:36 2015 UTC,"Most of the special purpose hunting knives are skinning knives, which are often different than the usual outdoor survival knife, although you can use almost any knife to skin if you are really persistent. Skinning knives often don't have as long of a blade, have more belly, and sometimes have a gut hook.   I use a mora companion for hunting and camping, because it is cheap, easy to sharpen (I did a secondary bevel, and it is non-serrated) and it is a solid good quality beater knife. They go for about 15$ on amazon.   I bring an estwing 'sportsman's hatchet' camping with me, and it works great. Those usually go for about 30 bucks in sporting goods stores or online. If you are doing more splitting and are less worried about size, they make great larger axes too."

Super great knife for about 30 bucks. It blows knives twice it's price out of the water. Another great knife around this price is the Spyderco Tenacious. The Kershaw Skyline is another popular choice in that range. If you want to go a little higher, I'd suggest looking at the Kershaw Blur, Kershaw Camber, and the Spyderco Delica. All great choices for 50-80 bucks. If you want to go really nice, I would point you toward the Benchmade Mini Griptillian, and the Spyderco Sage 1. Both will run you around 100 bucks. If I were to pick one knife from this list, it would be the Sage 1. Beautiful knife, with excellent steel, and classy carbon fiber scales (handle).  On the low end, I'd pick the RAT-1, and midrange, I would pick the Delica."

knives,3d1eo0,UncannyGodot,3,Mon Jul 13 03:11:49 2015 UTC,"Many of the most popular knife companies have international ties. Kershaw and Zero Tolerance are subsidies of Kai, a Japanese retail group. Kershaw produces plenty of its knives in China, as do SOG and CRKT. Spyderco produces knives in Japan, Taiwan, China, and a handful of European countries. Boker is German, Victorinox is Swiss. And perhaps most tellingly Kizer is another wholly Chinese company making awesome stuff. Frankly, the only big truly domestic company making modern folding knives that I can think of is Benchmade, and a few years ago they were making knives in China too.  Suffice to say, non-Americans can design and produce a fine knife, and usually for less than American companies. I like some of the stuff Camillus has been making recently. If buying American is important to you, do so, but not because a foreign designed or made knife is necessarily bad."

knives,3d2keb,BigWil,3,Mon Jul 13 02:52:54 2015 UTC,"$100ish is a good budget for a home cook. What you buy should depend on your experience and expectations as a user, particularly your sharpening routine.  You can get a Tojiro DP 210mm gyuto off Amazon right now for $59 with prime shipping. That's VG10 with a decent heat treatment to around 61HRC, a solid handle, and good ergonomics. Most knife people would be very happy with that.  If you want something a bit sturdier, you could get a Messermeister Elite 8"" chef knife. They're a refined rendition of the German chef knife with a few modest improvements over Henckels and Wusthof. They give you a choice of a pakka wood, poly, or olive wood handle. The fit and finish on these are exquisite.  If you want something similar to the DP but a little more impressive, look at the Kagayaki CarboNext or the Kanehide TK. Both are clones/alternate renditions of the Ichimonji TKC, so they're semi-stainless steel with a very neutral profile and somewhat thin grind. The Kagayaki usually comes with fucked up bevels, so you'll have to give it a full progression sharpening out of the box. The Kanehide comes with a small highly polished section near the edge that, in mine, was a little crooked, but came with a good out of the box edge. Both come with good fit and finish and nice handles. The steel both companies use is ridiculously easy to sharpen.  If you want a knife with a Japanese handle, I would suggest a Tanaka. They often come with rough fit and finish but with a little sandpaper to round the spine/choil and refine the handle, they're extremely impressive."

knives,3cz3tr,lasr00,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:41:27 2015 UTC,What's the Kabar like? I've read a lot about serrated edges and people say they're mostly pointless.
knives,3cz3tr,Saintzillla,2,Sun Jul 12 04:26:03 2015 UTC,Its a matter of preference. On bigger knives I like it because it makes them look scary and you can use it if you need to.  Because of the length of the blade you don't have to use the serration if you dont want. On folders I prefer plain edge because the partial serration takes up too much of the blade. Easier to sharpen. In general I'm a plain edge kinda guy but for stuff like the kbar I like the look it gives it. More rugged and intimidating.
knives,3cz3tr,lasr00,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:33:29 2015 UTC,"I've actually been on the fence about getting a KA-BAR with or without the serrations (I'm getting a KA-BAR either way) but I'm planning on getting it with the shortened blade (From 7"" to 5 1/4"") so would it still be worth it?"

knives,3d2dof,Snarggles,0,Mon Jul 13 01:24:16 2015 UTC,"I have a BM SOCP178 that I absolutely love, but tbh, I've been hearing kinda rough things about them lately.   I wouldn't want to think they're banking on reputation over quality, but their balisongs seem barely better than average, and their ""custom"" grips and mini-grips just make me cringe on principle. That's not custom, and as a knifemaker, they should know the difference."
knives,3d2dof,WillTellMissed,3,Mon Jul 13 01:39:29 2015 UTC,"I'm going to get downvoted for this but the pm2, for me at least, doesn't fit that role. For me the pm2 is a tactical knife and it doesnt do terribly well with much else (food prep and box cutting aside). It's not as tanky as the reviews would have you believe. The tip is quite fragile as I found out and though the lock up is legit, you have to do some adjusting to get it right. I'm not saying they're bad knives, they're just not do all/tank knives like they're said to be. That being said, I do carry mine quite a bit for self defense.  I own the manix2 and it gets the most carry time. The leaf blade is strong and versatile. It does everything and does everything well. It exceeded my expectation where the pm2 was a disappointment.   You might also consider kizer cutlery, they're made in China but if you didn't know that you would never guess. The quality is that good. They have some very very attractive options in your price range. I love my kizer.  Commence the downvotes."

knives,3d2dof,WillTellMissed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:44:29 2015 UTC,"Gotta dip the blade in cyanide...game changer. lol jk  Well, I'm not talking about stabbing though the pointy tip is good for that. The kind of self defense I'm talking about is for slashing which it's well suited for. The way I see it, I'm going to pull my knife in a situation where I have a chance. If the attacker has a gun, he/she can have whatever they want. If my attacker has a knife, I'm running. If my attacker has nothing but fists, I'm pulling my knife. Ya, he may have something hidden but if they pull it then I can reassess and make another choice. If I'm staying to fight, I'm slashing with the same or more violence and ferocity that's being presented to me. My logic is, how would I react if someone who I thought was vulnerable suddenly shows me they're not. Unless, they're mentally unstable/have nothing to lose, they're going to retreat. I would. Others may disagree and in most cases they might be right, but I don't have any other recourse in my county except pepper spray or a stun gun."

knives,3d2dof,usmcknifeguy,0,Mon Jul 13 04:32:36 2015 UTC,"Much weaker lock, less ergonomic handle, less EDC useful blade shape, less grippy handle, near-useless jimping, lacks a forward choil, steel more prone to chipping, steel that is not stainless.  If you're looking for a pretty knife, it might be subjectively better, but for a user, the pm2 is damned near the best on the market."
knives,3d2dof,outphase84,2,Mon Jul 13 21:57:12 2015 UTC,"Being the owner of both of those, and having used both on and off for about a year, I'll say that s30v is definitely more prone to chipping, the blade shape of the GB is just as useful as the para2, and lock strength doesn't mean much when the blade is so thin on the para2 that you'll break it in half way before the GB has a lock failure. The para2 is a good knife, but people put it on the pedestal far too often and everyone jumps on the bandwagon thinking it's the best thing ever"
knives,3d2dof,usmcknifeguy,0,Mon Jul 13 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"You're full of shit about s30v being more prone to chipping. Crucible makes all of their c-notch numbers publically available, and at the hardness of their s30v and their m4, it takes 30% less force to chip m4.   There's nothing fragile about the pm2's blade. You're off your rocker if you think you'll snap the blade before a liner lock fails. Especially considering the blades are about the same thickness, and m4 is a more brittle steel.   People put the pm2 on a pedestal because it's one of the best damned knives on the market. Even people who hate spyderco love the pm2. It's not fancy or trying to be a beauty queen. It's built from the ground up to be a hard use edc, and it excels at that."
knives,3d2dof,outphase84,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:08:11 2015 UTC,"M4 is a fucking tool steel, and given spyderco doesn't run it very hard means that yes, it's definitely tougher than s30v, it may not be 3v levels of tough but it'll definitely out perform s30v in everything but it's ability to not rust if you don't take care of it. And have you held a GB? That liner lock is basically a frame lock, damn thing is so thick they needed a lock relief to bend it. And I've seen a whole lot more evidence of broken tips and down right failed blades from the pm2 than I have from the GB. Also I've chipped almost every s30v and s35vn blade I've had, that steel is nothing special, it's becoming the normal run of the mill stuff, why else would people be getting all giddy about the m4 sprint run spyderco did on the pm2 a few months back, because it's way fucking better. And if we really want a super tough lock, perhaps we just need to look to benchmade for the axis lock, which is arguably better than the compression lock. Again the para 2 is good, but I wouldn't buy another one even with how cheap they are."
knives,3d2dof,Gromann,2,Tue Jul 14 13:21:14 2015 UTC,"M4 is a fucking tool steel, and given spyderco doesn't run it very hard means that yes, it's definitely tougher than s30v, it may not be 3v levels of tough but it'll definitely out perform s30v in everything but it's ability to not rust if you don't take care of it.   Spyderco runs it at 65 HRC.  You don't seem to understand how material works, so here's the short and simple:  the harder a material is, the more brittle it is.  Again, you can try to argue this all you want.  CPM publishes the c-notch tests for all of their materials.  At Spyderco's hardening, it takes 8.1ftlbs to chip M4, and 11ftlbs to chip S30V.  This isn't spewing opinion, this is the manufacturer of the steel's published information.  Harder steels will chip easier than softer steels.  This is true of every steel.  It's simple physics.  Softer materials will bend and give, harder materials will not.   And have you held a GB? That liner lock is basically a frame lock, damn thing is so thick they needed a lock relief to bend it.   Yes, I have.  And while it's a superb example of a liner lock, it still suffers from the same design problems that every other liner lock does:  hard gripping can actuate the lock(which isn't a problem on framelocks because gripping squeezes the lock tighter), and tension against the lock will attempt to deform the lock.   And I've seen a whole lot more evidence of broken tips and down right failed blades from the pm2 than I have from the GB.    You keep saying you've seen broken blades, I've never seen a single one.  And yeah, people have broken tips before, but that's a concern with any clip point, regardless of material.  Don't pry with fine tips.  You shouldn't be prying with a knife, anyway.   why else would people be getting all giddy about the m4 sprint run spyderco did on the pm2 a few months back,   Because every pm2 sprint run makes people go crazy.  They all sell out incredibly fast, regardless of blade material.     And if we really want a super tough lock, perhaps we just need to look to benchmade for the axis lock, which is arguably better than the compression lock.   Both locks are so strong that the tang of the blade will fail before the lock does, so that's kind of a moot point."
knives,3d2dof,statictonality,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:33:39 2015 UTC,"Very well then, I was under the impression spyderco ran all of their M4 at 62-63 hrc because that's what all of their mule blades tested at and I can't find anything stating otherwise. As for locks failing and blades breaking, neither of these are going to happen in day to day use unless you are abusing them. So I guess it comes down to looks, edge retention, corrosion resistance, and weight. To each their own, but for what it's worth I'll keep using my Tuff for hard use stuff and my Southard for normal stuff"
knives,3d2dof,statictonality,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:58:44 2015 UTC,"I think they generally keep their m4 around there, but Sal confirmed on the spyderco forums that the Bradley is hardened to 64-65, since that's what Gayle uses in competition. Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking the knife -- it's an excellent knife, I just don't think it's as good as the pm2 for an EDC. Especially my s35vn pm2  The southard and the tuff are both on my shopping list. How's the southard flip? It would be competing with the zt 0808 for pocket time for me."

I'm not extremely familiar with it because personally I don't care for Cold Steel. :) (and there's actually not any folding knife lockup stronger than a balisong).

Just to put it to perspective he filed off the serrations and I even saw him trying to ""sharpen"" a nail with it. Made me cringe just looking at it. But it kept trucking on despite the lack of love it had received."

When the blade was out it was great. but folded the spring latch would sit on the edge and release in my pocket. so I brought it back to the store I got it from and the other one they had did the same thing.

I have both and the moment I got the tenacious the shuffle got pushed out of rotation. Not to mention the spydie hole is much more comfortable and natural feeling than a thumbstud. The whole blade is a belly which gives it tones of cutting potential over a tango style blade and it comes razor sharp out of the box.

Depends on your environment, but the Tenacious is just large enough to get weird looks from coworkers/customers when I pull it out, but the Persistence offers the same design and functionality with a smaller blade. It's a spectacular EDC knife, and despite not being top of the line or anything, it feels really excellent. It's become my go to EDC, even over some of my much more expensive blades, just because of the size and ergonomics. I really can't recommend it enough."

It rests nicely in your fist and feels even better backwards for throat slitting lol. Plus it looks pretty rad sitting on its back like it is in the picture.

knives,3cwjfa,docfelt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:00:59 2015 UTC,I never got a shipping email. It just showed up one day and I was pleasantly surprised.
knives,3cwjfa,docfelt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:16:48 2015 UTC,That's interesting.  Thanks for the info.  The email i got saying it was being assembled/sharpened states that the next email I would receive would be with the shipping info.    I've had things come up missing from my house before so id really appreciate a tracking number.
knives,3cyg89,wangibangi,4,Sat Jul 11 22:34:58 2015 UTC,"Smith and Wesson knives are generally not the greatest. A missing screw seems a bit weird though, maybe you just got the odd one out. But yeah, Kershaw is just a better knife company. From my experience with them, all of my knives have come sharp and everything was in its place. The only issue I've had with Kershaw is a loose scale on my Injection 3.0."
knives,3cyg89,pengabear,3,Sun Jul 12 00:22:14 2015 UTC,Any Taylor brand knife is going to be made of sub par materials and cut cost manufacturing. You could take pictures and write an email asking for replacement parts but I wouldn't waste anymore of my time.
knives,3cyg89,poopscarf,3,Sun Jul 12 03:32:33 2015 UTC,So I bought this knife today. It looked good in the store and I wanted something cheap to use outdoors/in the woods and I liked the black.  I didn't have too high expectation since it was cheap. When I got home I unpacked it and there was already a screw missing. Luckily I had a similiar one in my screw jar. Then I wanted to see how it feels without the clip and bummer the screw is already round. Another thing I noticed: if I open the knife slow via thumbstud (instead of flicling it open) the linear lock doesn't fully snap on... just a little bit. To all that the edge on it is pretty bad(its still sharp though)  Is this normal or did I just had bad luck?  I mean my kershaw chill was also pretty cheap and yet it is very nice and even after over a half year edc I love it.
knives,3cyg89,longswordjockey,4,Sat Jul 11 22:42:00 2015 UTC,This is 100% normal for this caliber of knife. Your kershaw and the mass market smith/etc knives are WORLDS apart in quality. Surprised you got an edge out of box whatsoever. Money is always better spent on even the cheapest SOG/Kershaw/CRKT etc. At that price point for what you wanted I would have snagged a RAT 1 on Amazon.

I know for their Kirkland ""craft beers"", they have at least 2 different contractors (one for West Coast, one for East Coast) but I don't know who makes this light beer since it's a pretty recent addition to their lineup.  I will say that their Kirkland branded ""craft beers"" are pretty decent for the price. Not the best tasting or overwhelmingly amazing, but they're good when you have a very huge party and need lots of good brews to go around.

I really loved the versatility of the blunt til with chisel grind. It was great for prying tasks and being used as a flat head screw driver. However I had a lot of trouble keeping (and getting) the chisel grind sharp. Eventually the blade got so beat up and I lost a piece during cleaning that I sent it back to Benchmade for repairs and a note asking them to switch blades to the 915 style. I like the 915 blade way more. It's still very thick all the way up to the tip, the blade shape is great, and I have no trouble beating on it a bit.   Oh, and the 916 blade was partially serrated. Ew.   Here's an album: http://imgur.com/a/hc9CL"

knives,3cx9j9,xlorken,2,Sat Jul 11 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"I make knives from 6al4v, with thin geometry and carbidizing, they actually hold up really well. Especially in terms of holding a working edge, they do so very well.   But you really need carbidizing, otherwise edge retention falls off like crazy. But they are perfectly serviceable!   For something that can save your life, I'd still go with a Nitrogen steel or something like that, though."
knives,3cx9j9,Valencourtcustom,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:18:03 2015 UTC,"Tell me more! How do I go about the carbidizing, or do you recommend I return the knife and get something else?

knives,3cx9j9,Valencourtcustom,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:57:00 2015 UTC,"I have some machines I use for carbidizing, but basically I am welding Tungstem carbide to the blade, in short.  This is done on one side of the knife only. If you look at this post of a knife I made. One side has no carbidizing, the other has gold carbidizing. What happens is, as you use the knife, the side without Tungsten carbide (Which is far harder than any steel, 9.5 on Mohs hardness scale, almost diamond hardness) will wear away faster than the side with Tungsten carbide. The side with tungsten carbide will hold up to abuse, the softer Ti side will wear away. So this leaves you with more exposed carbide as you use the knife, giving you a self sharpening, toothy edge, effectively. I find in my testing, that as I use the knives, the edges become grittier, which is nice for baic cutting.   I'd love to see this knife you are talking about, personally unless it is at least 6al4V I wouldn't purchase it, but that's me, and Ti can be carbidized, I do offer the service. :D  It won't hold as well as steel, but you'll get all the advantages of using Ti, no one perfect knife."

So popular that the chinese made a fake version of it that is so close only knife nuts can tell when it's taken apart.  regular one is about $400.  This one was $55. This one came with CF scales, regular is with brown G10.  They say on the legit version steel is supersteel... and this one like aus-8 normal.   nobody has confirmed eitherway but i'd assume more or less correct.  spyderco version has more hard square lines on every edge, like spydie hole, etc.  this one slightly rounded.  That's most of the differences.  I have a lot of knives, some expensive, some not... though this is just my opinion.  Weigh it as you see fit."

knives,3ctwpk,djstefan96,11,Fri Jul 10 19:16:03 2015 UTC,"Sure.  Tl;Dr: stabbed a guy because I parked where his drug dealer liked to park.  It was a warm muggy night and me and my 9 month pregnant wife went to our favorite little river front bar and grill for 25 cent wing night. The parking lot was small and already full so we parked in the street in front of a house, which wasn't the first time and we weren't the first to park there.  We had a wonderful dinner while I watch her demolish 2 dozen wings.  After paying our tab and thanking out waitress we went outside to see that our car was intentionally blocked in by two other cars. When I say intentionally, there was no way either of them were able to park so close without someone guiding them. There was maybe a fist width between the three cars bumpers. I approached the fence to the back yard of the house we were in front of and firmly but politely asked that one of the cars be moved so we could leave.  This guy comes out really aggressively, starts making threats and pulling his shirt off to show me his prison tattoos and just generally talking shit.  About that time, a girl came out of the back yard and starts to get in the car blocking me from the rear.  I climb into my own car, shut the door and put my seat belt on. From the corner of my eye I catch a shadow coming up the drivers side rear of my car. As soon as I saw him, he had my door open and was punching me in the head repeatedly. My pistol was on my right side in a concealment holster with a seatbelt on top of it.  I reached into my left pocket and pull out my trusty Blur, pop the seat belt and jump out of the car and went prone with an open knife. The guy jumps back 10 feet immediately. At this point the car behind me has moved enough to get out so I jump back in the car, knife still in hand just wanting the Fuck out of there.  I have no idea what possessed the first guys buddy to attack someone with an open knife but he did. Two punches in I thrust my blade out and caught him from wrist to elbow filleting his arm open. After he retreated I made a hasty escape around the block and called 9-11. The LEO's that responded were polite and courteous and had obviously had problems with these kids before because not once was I treated like I was responsible or guilty.  The kid that got cut was life flighted to another hospital because the local one wasn't staffed to deal with his wounds. He spent three weeks there.  No charges were ever brought up even though I tried to push the police to. They finally told me to drop it because they were both being charged with felony B&E a week after the bleeder was released from the hospital.  To this day, that is the worst thing I have ever done to another human.  I played it in my head a thousand times end no matter the what ifs, I did the right thing.  I felt bad, but not guilty, he had it coming. The cop even told me I should have just shot him to make his life easier.  So that's my story.  If anyone knows where to pick up another Kershaw Tanto Blur with grip tape, I would love to buy it, even if it's out of your own personal collection and a little worn. That knife started my love of Kershaws."

It's a steel blade made to look like obsidian.  It even has an edge if you look close.  It's super nice work.  If  you want one like it you're going to have to figure out who made it and talk to them.  Cause i've never seen anything like it.  It almost fooled me for a sec.

knives,3cqqxp,ztealthy,6,Fri Jul 10 14:57:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's very very similar to glass.   Glass when it breaks too can break in a way to create an edge that cuts better than a razor.  again, very brittle and will chip when you cut things or look at it funny.  But for that first lil bit it's gonna cut better than anything."
knives,3cqqxp,Silverlight42,3,Fri Jul 10 11:46:54 2015 UTC,"Yup, obsidian blades are still used over steel in some surgery and for cutting on a molecular level.   Arrow heads can hit bone and still be in good shape (flint, I'm not too sure about obsidian) without losing too much, or even a noticeable amount of material sometimes."

Real knapped obsidian  It's a technique where they take a tool and chip away the hard obsidian.  It creates an ultra sharp edge, but obsidian being so hard it's brittle, so it chips easy.  Obsidian can be sharper than any steel.  They make scalpels out of the stuff for when they need to make insane perfect cuts.  Hope this helps"

knives,3cqqxp,Silverlight42,2,Tue Jul 14 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"yeah I have no idea.  I've never seen anything like it apart from scales... and they didn't match that... totally different G-10 or micarta from steel though...  But here is an example of scalloped scales.  Now... if you're trying to look for what you're looking for... traditionally when working with obsidian or flint, that technique is called knapping... used for flint or obsidian mostly.  So you're looking for a blade with a knapped look.  Like I said I'm really sure it's a unique look so you can't find that anywhere but from this particular person that made the blade likely.  No idea how they did it on the actual blade but it's definitely not by the same means.  Just grinding of some sort i'm guessing.  You can see the grind marks up in there.  You might be able to get some other maker to do it... but likely they'll refuse or not do anywhere near that quality a job.  Just my take on it."
knives,3cqqxp,micahkid,2,Fri Jul 10 18:32:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's done on G10/Micarta with a dremel/wen tool, but I've never seen how the technique is done on steel.  Borka blades is a maker I follow that does a similar technique on his spines.  I'd really like to try it on some steel, but I'm looking for a tutorial that isn't hammering the steel while it's coming out of a forge...  I'm wondering if it's just done the same way with a dremel before it's heat treated and the steel is soft."

knives,3cpvwu,hundred_ways,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:36:48 2015 UTC,"I have one and so far, I really like it. It's simple and not perfectly finished but it is well made and the sheath is excellent. The blade was very sharp out of the box and has stayed that way with some stropping. The handle was oiled at the factory but the sheath had absorbed some of the oil, creating dry spots. I've applied Danish oil a couple times and it's starting to look pretty good. One last thing to consider is that it's 1075 steel (so is the LT Wright). It's easier to sharpen than 1095 so maybe it's a better knife to start out with but it won't hold an edge as long. Overall, it feels like a steal for $35."

Could be my imagination but something about the way it snaps closed doesnt feel right. I watched that YouTube video that someone posted in this thread. In the video he talks about removing burr and some other stuff I don't know what that is. I'm guessing you already know all that stuff? Would you hone it or strop it or any of that?

I've done small customizations on knives for my Fianceé, mother in law, uncle, various friends and my dad. I like seeing knives used, and maybe even a little abused. And besides, my karma could use some up upping, haha."
knives,3cr69h,LtPlatypus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:20:26 2015 UTC,"It can be done fairly easily with a victorinox. Though those serrations are not terrible they'll probably diminish on their own with regular use of a sharpening stone if you treat it like any other knife. I can remove them and have an edge put on with a finer tip. You'll lose a bit of blade material, but that is how the metal working game works, you can't remove serrations and have just as much steel as before."
knives,3cr69h,xtremepado,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:07:34 2015 UTC,Someone else offered to take them off for me too. I'm kind of surprised. Is that just how the knife community is? How do I decide who to give my blade to for serration removal?
knives,3cr69h,slowwburnn,2,Fri Jul 10 15:13:54 2015 UTC,"Well I do it for money and people will probably tell you if you ask that I am reputable, but yes, people generally are very nice around here. I mean don't just go trusting everyone with your stuff lol,  but in all actuality yeah, people on these knife communities are very nice people. If someone offered to do so for free, ask a few questions pertaining to the job such as ""How long will you have my knife?"", ""What do you plan to do to do the work?"", ""What do you want for shipping?"", ""Do you have any examples of your work?"".  Edit: As far as me goes, PM me for pricing, but I won't have your knife longer than a week, the turnaround for a knife generally is a week from you shipping it, to you looking and finding it in your mailbox. Plus I will have good correspondence if you've got questions while I've got your knife. Here is an example of my work, I put the edge on there as well as the top swedge bevel on the top side of the blade."
knives,3cna5m,perfunctificus,4,Thu Jul 9 05:54:21 2015 UTC,"I had some thin 440C from jantz that had been kicking around for a while and I had no plans for, so I decided to experiment a bit and make this.  First knife I've done with a plunge in a few months, quite happy with the results there.  Turns out this was probably the hardest grind I've ever done, the blade is so thin and flimsy that keeping the surfaces flat is a real challenge.  Everything you do, both pre and post-ht, will curve the blade and you constantly have to be working it back to straight.  Wasn't sure how it would fare through ht being super thin (0.005"" at edge, ~0.09"" spine), but Peters' nailed it as usual and it came back spot on.  Handle is ironwood burl, fastened with two corbys on either side of the mosaic pin, with G10 spacers against the tang."

I have an Osborne 940-1 on the way that weighs 2.4oz. I would love an Al Mar Falcon that weighs less than 2oz. So 2oz would almost double the weight of my EDC knives.

knives,3cnbml,Kromulent,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:39:23 2015 UTC,"I believe your Spyderco Cat has a 440 stainless blade. It is possible for it to rust, particularly if it is exposed to blood or salty water, but it does not require undue care. Just keep it clean and dry.  I rarely if ever disassemble my knives. Soap and water are perfectly good for cleaning a knife like this, or you could hose down the joint with lighter fluid if there is something gummy in there. Some lubricants (particularly WD40) turn into a gummy varnish after a while. Just use plain gun oil or sewing machine oil, nothing fancy. A drop or to into the joint after it is clean and dry and you are good to go.  To protect the tip, just remember it is small and comparatively frail. Twisting action or sideways force on a tip is bad. If the tip is embeded in something, only apply pressure straight down or straight up.  You have a good quality knife, it should last a good long time. If you do damage the tip I'd expect Spyderco could make it right for a minimal cost."

Honorable mentions: microtech - could easily be on this list, top notch quality but not easily serviceable by yourself;  spyderco - not as consistent as others on this list but their spectrum of designs is mind boggling and their collaborations are the nutz;  benchmade - excellent customer service but their prices don't match their quality or consistency but I love the axis lock;  rockstead - the ultimate in quality but quirky designs and out of this world prices;  Kershaw - excellent values and designs, others just ultimately take the cake for me.

knives,3cl6x7,lejalapeno,4,Wed Jul 8 19:43:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely. You could honestly get all three for under $100 and be happy.  The best modern cleavers you see floating around are the Dexter-Russels with the wood handles, though for the record I usually prefer a hacksaw with a devoted blade.  For filet and boning knives, the style you want is important. Victorinox and Dester-Russell make great boning knives in their Fibrox and SaniSafe lines, respectively. If you want a more impressive wood handle you could look into F.Dick. If you want to get into harder Japaneae knives look at a 150mm petty. They are more likely to chip against bone if your techniqie isn't good, but they hold an edge much better. Tojiro's DP line would certainly make you happy."
knives,3cl6x7,UncannyGodot,2,Wed Jul 8 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is that there is no good compromise between a bone breaking cleaver and an all purpose one like a ""Chinese cleaver ""? Which is why you opt for a hacksaw?"
knives,3cl6x7,UncannyGodot,3,Thu Jul 9 03:28:32 2015 UTC,I'd say there's a middle ground that's too thick for effective use for most vegetables but too thin for bones. A Chinese cleaver is going to be far too thinly ground to go through bone.  I like a hacksaw (or a bandsaw) because I don't like the splintering a cleaver can cause going through bone. For going through joints any boning knife will be a better option than a cleaver.

However, to maintain the blade itself, most people will use something like renaissance wax, or alternatively frog lube or just really light mineral oil. Lithium grease would probably work, but I prefer a lighter oil. Oil will help to protect the blade itself against rust. It is important to also clean any gunk off your blade, because the rust will start there."

For my 30th I was trying to find a high-quality, high-value folder to incorporate with my EDC. Two months later, I kept finding myself staring at the Hogue Extreme Series 4"" Drop Point in Aluminum. After going back and forth for a few weeks between Benchmade, ZT, and a few others I pulled the trigger and - Oh God - I'm glad I did.  It's lightweight (Al frame) is perfectly balanced, blade thickness is smack-dap in that sweetspot of full utility without being absurdly thick, and the geometry of the large drop-point blade w/ swedge is simultaneously gorgeous and intimidating in person.  I get open-mouthed gawks whenever I use it around my buddies, which is super validating and feels great to someone who's otherwise prone to buyer's regret.  Obviously folders/hawks = apples/oranges but Hogue has won me over as a client.  Post-purchase I read someone's post in which they described the fit & finish quality as being on par with some of their higher-end ""mid tech"" knives, and I whole-heartedly agree.  As long as Hogue maintains their manufacturing quality, they've got a client for life. If my EX is any indication, you can buy with confidence. For anyone who's on the fence regarding a purchase, that's a big deal."

knives,3cks0e,flat_pointer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:45:37 2015 UTC,"Ah gotcha. Well, enjoy! Probably the responses you're getting are in part 'cause we're snobs who sneer at Mantis Knives and 420HC (though to be fair, Swiss Army Knives are probably just 420HC and I always have one of those)."
knives,3cks0e,louie1113,5,Wed Jul 8 22:22:19 2015 UTC,I think you could do far better for a fixed edc knife. That thing will be excesively heavy given the thick blade stock and won't slice very well also because of the thick stock. Something like a tops blue otter or a fixed buck omni hunter would suit edc needs much better. Also if u want to do a paracord wrap the ESEE izula would be a good choice.
knives,3cks0e,flat_pointer,5,Wed Jul 8 20:16:13 2015 UTC,"Seems like you'd be better off with a Cold Steel Bushman or a Mora.   Really, if you need a light/moderate EDC knife, you should look at folding knives like the Ontario Rat II or a Spyderco Tenacious or a million different knives from Kershaw as well.   Tanto blades are less than fun to sharpen, in my experience. 420J 420HC means you will likely have to sharpen the knife more often, as it can be pretty soft."
knives,3cks0e,Zickefoose,4,Wed Jul 8 20:11:04 2015 UTC,I don't think you'll find anyone here who owns one. More than likely this is because most people would prefer using a fixed blade knife with good steel (1095) for cutting things and using a $10 pry bar for prying things.

knives,3cffql,TheRealJasonsson,4,Tue Jul 7 20:16:43 2015 UTC,"The defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree (see Penal Law § 265.01) for possessing what was alleged to be a gravity knife. On appeal, he asserts that the knife he admittedly possessed, what is commonly known as a ""butterfly knife,"" did not fit within the statutory definition of a gravity knife (see Penal Law § 265.00) and thus the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. We agree. Penal Law § 265.00(5) defines a ""Gravity knife"" as a ""knife which has a blade which is released from the handle or sheath thereof by the force of gravity or the application of centrifugal force which, when released, is locked in place by means of a button, spring, lever or other device."" We agree with the defendant's contention that a gravity knife, as so defined, requires that the blade lock in place automatically upon its release and without further action by the user. It is undisputed that the knife the defendant possessed was a type of ""butterfly knife"" which required manual locking. Thus, it does not come within the definition of a ""Gravity knife"" as that instrument is defined by Penal Law § 265.00(5) (see People v. Mott, 137 Misc.2d 757,758; People v. Dolson, 142 Misc.2d 779, 780). Accordingly, the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the defendant's conviction on the fourth count of the indictment, which alleged that he possessed a gravity knife in violation of Penal Law § 265.01 (see People v. Perez, 123 A.D.2d 721, 722; see generally People v. Contes,60 N.Y.2d 620). Since the defendant was acquitted of the remaining counts alleged in the indictment, it must be dismissed."

knives,3cg9qr,kyleqead,11,Tue Jul 7 18:00:19 2015 UTC,Leatherman is generally the best value while Victorinox is going to be higher quality. It seems that most multi-tools don't include tweezers. The Leatherman Micra is the one that I am aware of. The Leatherman Wave is probably the most popular MT and your requirements seem pretty basic so I would recommend that as a starting point. From there you can go lighter and simpler with a Skeletool or bigger and more features with the Charge TI that you have been eying. Or you can go big (and I mean big and heavy) with a Leatherman Surge.  The great thing about the charge is that you get an S30V steel knife. There is also the Charge AL which slims down compared to the TI and still has great knife steel.
knives,3cg9qr,nreyes238,2,Tue Jul 7 18:21:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks. The skeletool doesn't really interest me as i already have a killer blade, the spyderco Calypso 3.5 ZDP189 with Carbon fiber scales."
knives,3cg9qr,nreyes238,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"I'm of the same mind. If I were to get another full sized MT, I'd probably swap the blade out for another tool since I always carry a folding knife."

knives,3cg9qr,Skwirlman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:20:47 2015 UTC,"That is their reputation. It seems to be the more refined tool. It should be smooth and solid. The machining will just feel nicer and more precise. The handles will be smooth in your palms when you use the pliers. The downsides that I have heard are that it is not as strong as a leatherman when put to hard use (Some would just say it is abuse instead of hard use), It doesn't appear as easily modified by the user as a leatherman, and some of the Swisstool variants have a lot of redundant tools like 3 flat-head screwdrivers."

I carry one every day complimented by a 4"" Proto crescent wrench and  Stremelight Protac 1-L. Amazing combo. Although, I'm a contractor in a chemical plant.  The Wingman is a nice edc, although slightly heavy. It have a pocket clip and a decent amount of tools, plus a wallet easy price point! Also, spring loaded pliers!

If you get a Micra or Squirt and don't want to take your keys out every time, get a pocket dangler. I suggest the Pangea Designs Pickpocket Torq. I have one and it's actually a great bottle opener and the Leatherman adds leverage and grip. A+ combos. Again, I speak from experience.   Also, the Skeletool.

knives,3cg9qr,calyco81,5,Wed Jul 8 02:43:47 2015 UTC,I use my leatherman wingman everyday. I love the ergo. The tool fits well in your hand when opened and there is good action on the pliers. All of the tools open smooth and lock up tight. I had a wave in the past but most of it went unused.  I prefer my wingman.
knives,3cg9qr,ArzenHouse,4,Tue Jul 7 19:48:20 2015 UTC,"I have a Victorinox SwissTool that has lived in my glove box for close to 20 years.  It has been a great tool, but admittedly has lead a pretty east life.  I have used Gerber MTs and recently got the Leatherman Sidekick.  The Swisstool is much more solid then either of those.  I've never used the Leatherman Wave to compare it to.   I like the ST because all the tools are accessible without having to open the pliers, but all take 2 hands to open.  It's comfortable to use, but is a little too big for me to want to carry in my pocket.  The case is nice, but holds tight enough that it's easier to use 2 hands to get it out.  So it's a great tool, but not as convenient as some of the Leatherman models.  That's why I got the Sidekick to EDC but bring the ST when I know I will need a better tool"
knives,3cg9qr,kennethsime,3,Tue Jul 7 20:08:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your detailed reply. The locking mechanism in the ST looks very nice to me, and it seems its only negative when compared to the Charge TTi is its lower quality blade, which isn't an issue for me."
knives,3cg9qr,Number_06,2,Tue Jul 7 20:36:56 2015 UTC,"Been carrying Victorinox Spirit to work for many years while the Leatherman Wave sits at home. Some reasons are just personal preference, but some are pretty objective stuff.  The quality of fit and finish is much better on the Spirit. Everything moves smoothly and snaps in and out of place with a spring and lock. It's a simpler tool, with less parts. It gets dirty and wet and I need to be able to just shake it out and not worry about cleaning and rust. Wave has a million nooks and parts. Wave has a one-handed knife, which would be illegal in much of Europe. I wish Victorinox made a version for north america with a thumb stud. Leatherman has some awesome designs, and many of them to suit different needs.  I could write and essay going over pros and cons for each.  To sum it up, I wish the two would have a bastard offspring. The quality and engineering of Victorinox, with the design concepts of Leatherman."

knives,3cho6e,sprinklydonut,9,Wed Jul 8 00:02:38 2015 UTC,"Stay away from pull through style sharpeners if that's what you meant by pocket pal.  The only good sharpeners use some form of abrasives (usually synthetic stones, ceramics, or diamond plates). There's many functional abrasive based products that are operated in different ways. Which is best for you depends on you (budget, willingness to spend time learning/practicing, time alotment for sharpening in general, preferences in materials etc) and what knives you will be using it to sharpen.  Stones require the largest learning curve but once you  get good at it, they can be the fastest and most versatile tools for sharpening. They range in price dramatically - You can get a knife sharp with no more than a 20 dollar stone (eg double sided norton india stone), but you can also spend thousands to collect a range of different stone types and grit levels while chasing the perfect edge (eg high end Japanese natural water stones). Most hand sharpeners take the middle ground and build a collection of stones over the years as they come to view sharpening as a hobby.  -stones can be split into 3 categories, 1) oilstones, 2) waterstones, and 3) diamond stones.   oilstones include synthetic stones, usually made from aluminum oxide or silicon carbide, as well as natural stones such as arkansas stones. These are typically lubricated with oil while sharpening and tend to work a little slower than waterstones and diamond stones. Silicon carbide will generally cut any steel allright, but aluminum oxide and arkansas have problems with some of the modern wear resistant high carbide steels. The cheap sharpening stone you can usually pick up at ace hardware is an example of an oilstone, as is the norton india I mentioned above - both are fairly coarse. The arkansas stones are more of medium to fine stones - again they tend to cut slower than other options but they wear down very slow so they require little maintenance and will last a lifetime. In oilstones coarse is generally up to around 300 grit, medium is between 300 and 800, and fine is anything higher. A sharp blade (but toothy) can be made with only medium stone, but a typical kit would include a coarse and fine stone as well. The smiths and lansky tri hone kits are decent inexpensive ways to get into oilstones, I have heard good things about stones from here too. waterstones include synthetic stones made from various abrasives and binder material, as well as natural Japanese stones. The waterstones are known for  releasing abrasive fast to keep the stones cutting quickly, and thus they tend to be faster at cutting most steels than their oilstone counterparts. However the faster wear means they have to be flattened frequently and have a shorter life. Additionally many water stones must be soaked in water prior to use. Different waterstones have different abilities in what steels they cut well, some (eg shapton glass) reportedly cut modern wear resistant high carbide steels well, others not so much. In waterstones, coarse is anything under 800, medium is between 800 and 2000, and fine is anything higher than that. A new sharpener can certainly get away with a medium stone only (again you can get very sharp but toothy edges), but a typical kit would include a coarse, medium and fine stone because it allows faster bevel setting, reprofiling, and repair with the coarse stone, and a more refined edge with the fine. An economical way to get into water stones is to buy a combination stone with a medium and fine side (eg a king 1k/6k, or a suehiro 1k/3k), and use drywall screen mounted on something flat (eg a chunk of marble off a broken countertop) to ""lap"" aka flatten the stone as needed. A more full kit would include a coarse, medium, and fine stone from reliable brands (like shapton, naniwa, nubatama, arashiyama, suihiro, beston/bester etc etc.) and a coarse diamond stone for lapping (dmt xxc or atoma 140). diamond stones are straight forward, they are just diamond particles set into a flat metal sheet. They are nice because they always stay flat, unlike all other stones, but their useful life is less ime to most normal stones and they are fairly expensive. Diamond excel on modern hard steels. The grit numbers for courseness roughly match what i said above for oilstones. Again you can get away with just a medium, but coarse and fine will give you more versatility and may speed up your process. Smiths and eze lap make some more affordable options, dmt is sort of the middle ground, and atoma are the top of the line. I've only tried dmt so I can't comment on comparisons here.    Angled kits require a shorter learning curve but tend to take more time to use each time once you are proficient, and each have their own limitations. They also range in price from about 20 dollars to nearly a thousand depending on what accessories you want.    One style of kit uses ceramic rods that are held in place at a certain angle and the user slides a blade down against them - this style includes the highly regarded spyderco sharpmaker as well as the more inexpensive lansky turnbox. These are great for maintaining properly sharpened knives quickly, but are bad at reprofiling and taking damage out of blade edges.  Another style of kit clamps the blade in place and the user slides stones attached to a guided rod against it. This style includes the inexpensive but highly regarded lansky deluxe and diamond kits, the mid range kme sharpener, the edge pro apex, and the wicked edge. The lansky has trouble with blades much over 4-5 inches and is limited in the angles it can make - however it is an easy and economical kit if you are only interested in sharpening folding knives and small hunting knives etc. The other systems have fewer limitations but they get pricey fast.   There is popular misconception that ""Sharpening steels"" like those that come with most knife sets are used to sharpen knives. In fact they are only useful in very skilled hands at prolonging the usefulness of an edge shaped on abrasives like those described above. Beginners should stay away from steels, it is very easy to dull an edge with and difficult to utilize their small value to the average knife user."

knives,3cho6e,accountonphone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:23:36 2015 UTC,Absolutely. You just need to grind down the edge bevel and set a new apex. How hard it is depends on the level of damage.
knives,3cho6e,accountonphone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:39:14 2015 UTC,Why do some people wet the blade or stone before sharpening?
knives,3cho6e,_psycho_dad_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:31:48 2015 UTC,"Most stones work better with lubrication. In the case of waterstones (and diamond stones potentially according to preference), water is the lubricant. It helps float metal particles above the surface, helping the stone not to ""load"" (when steel cloggs up the surface, slowing the cutting speed). Also the wetness of water stones affects the speed of abrasive release. Waterstones also tend to form a slurry or mud made of water and spent abrasive which can be used to affect the way the stone cuts in favorable ways. Wetting also affects how the grinding feels by hand and may aid in a users ability to keep proper angles."
knives,3cho6e,accountonphone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:02:14 2015 UTC,The stone arguably works a bit better and it also contains the metallic particles that's coming off your knife. You shouldn't be inhaling that stuff. Removing that metal has a very specific smell and if you're smelling it...well...it's going into your lungs.

I do know that at the very least I would be looking for stones that ship from Japan,  both of the stones you listed appear to originate in china.   Assuming those are quality stones and labeled accurately, 1000/4000 is a decent medium and fine grit range. 3000/8000 is a pretty fine combo, if that's your only stone you are still going to want to get a 1000 or 800 grit stone for bevel setting.

knives,3cho6e,BigWil,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:40:33 2015 UTC,"Assuming you got a medium grit stone then... it should be plenty to get sharp but may take some time depending on how dull your knife is. Dont get discouraged. If you stay on top of sharpening before your knives get too dull and avoid damaging them, it should work out great for you. Let me know what stone you decided on.  You definitely do not need a honing rod or strop - a good diamond stone should let you get shaving sharp edges by itself. I have some recommended YouTube channels of you want help with how to and form. Good luck with the practice to come.  Lots of beginners rely too heavily on strops because strops make it easier to get a high level of initial sharpness even with bad techique, but that bad technique damages the apex steel and sacrifices edge retention. However with good form a strop may help you bring out an even sharper/finer edge than you can get without one and can be a fast and easy way to maintain your edge between sharpenings. It can be a great tool, but it's certainly optional. A ceramic or diamond rod or tapered rod could be useful if you have recurved blades or serrated blades you want to sharpen, otherwise id stay away."
knives,3cho6e,accountonphone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:31:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for all your help man.  Recurved blade like the big belly on my spyderco?
knives,3cho6e,WhiteStripesWS6,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:45:56 2015 UTC,"Recurves refer to blades whose edges make sort of an S shape, curve inward like the inverse of normal belly, or other funky non traditional designs. They can be hard to reach with just a flat stone (you can sometimes get away with just using the corner of the stone). The big belly on a knife should be no problem for your stone."
knives,3cho6e,accountonphone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:52:56 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you're looking to get out of it but first of all, avoid pull through sharpeners.  Anyway, If you're willing to put a lot of practice into it and eventually get great results, I would go with stones. If your sharpening will involve reprofiling (changing the angle of the bevel) then a Lansky 5 stone deluxe set might fit you best. I'm very happy that I went with the Spyderco Sharpmaker. It's super easy to figure out how to use and will produce screaming sharp knives in no time. it does have a couple downsides compared to the other two though, 1) it's not perfect for reprofiling, even with the diamond stones. and 2) lack of options for angle (at 30 and 40 inclusive). But once you get past that (which should only be a max of once per knife) it's great.  Personally, I'll probably move on to free handing with stones sooner or later but the SM is a great starting point.  Also, pick up a strop."
knives,3cho6e,WhiteStripesWS6,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:59:53 2015 UTC,Why would one want to change the bevel?
knives,3cho6e,UncannyGodot,2,Wed Jul 8 00:27:31 2015 UTC,"Thinner knives cut better but sacrifice strength. This is especially true the closer you get to the edge apex. If you want to improve the cutting performance of a knife, one thing you can do is reprofile the bevel to a shallower angle which makes the blade thinner near the apex. On the other hand, if you have a blade who's edge is taking damage during use, you will probably want to add a steeper bevel.  I thin out the edge bevel if almost every knife I own, you might be surprised  at how much better a knife will cut with a lower bevel angle and the shoulders of the bevel knocked back."
knives,3cho6e,kennethsime,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:10:32 2015 UTC,shoulders of the bevel knocked back.   Could you elaborate on what this means?
knives,3cho6e,_psycho_dad_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:17:52 2015 UTC,"A shoulder can be thought of as the intersection of two planes at an obtuse angle - the plane of the bevel, and the plane of the primary grind. Where they intersect, there is a sort of corner, commonly referred to as the shoulder. You can grind down that corner, smoothing the transition from bevel to primary grind, reducing both wedge effects and friction as you cut.   One approach to this is a simple flat ""back bevel"" where you pick an angle shallower than the edge bevel and grind down, but stop before ever reaching the apex. This creates sort of a stepped transition from bevel to primary grind. Another approach is to add a ""convex"" back bevel, rounding it so the transition is smoother."
knives,3cho6e,_psycho_dad_,2,Wed Jul 8 17:21:32 2015 UTC,"Ok, so the bevel being the part where the angle of the blade grind meets the actual angle of the cutting edge.  I see what you're saying now, thanks!"
knives,3cho6e,_psycho_dad_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:11:35 2015 UTC,"It depends. Different needs benefit from different equipment. If you want something easy and cheap, the Spyderco Sharpmaker or, perhaps, a Lansky sharpener. If you want something easy and price is no object, a Wicked Edge or an Edge Pro. If you want something light and easy to transport, some sort of compact diamond plate. If you want the most utility, benchstones or plates. Stones feel better and offer a variety of finishes on most steels, but perform poorly on some highly alloyed high end steels. Plates are again easier to transport and cut all steels extremely well. You can add a bench grinder for lower grits and heavy work."

Latin American or bolo style are my preference.  For that type of work, soft mild carbon steel makes a lot of sense because they hit lots of rocks and knots and glance off things at strange angles, putting tons of pressure at the edge. Harder steels would chip badly and take much more time to sharpen in the field.   In other words machetes are hard use blades and they get banged up a lot so spending a lot on steel and fit and finish for them doesn't make sense.   With your budget you could buy a good working machete for brush clearing and also a fun big camp knife or chopper/splitter or the like. I might buy a good tramontina bolo 14 inch, and with the rest try out an esee junglas, becker bk9, Ontario sp50 sp51 or rtak2, HI ang khola, etc or even a nice hatchet."

I used wet or dry sandpaper, from 400 to 800. It took around 2 hours. It's far from perfect and I will probably try again with better tools (I used a semi hard sand block but should have use a hard one). Also, next time, I will start with 200 or 300 grit sandpaper to make sure all the small dents from the stonewash are gone.

knives,3cggdn,ZMush,3,Tue Jul 7 18:45:16 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming that the blade of your knife is held in place with a pin, which is peened on each end. 'Peening' means that it's been tapped to expand the end of the pin over the hole, to fix it in place.  If you are brave, and if this is not a valuable or antique knife, you can peen the pin a little further to tighten it. If you really want to do it right, you can get a little tool with a rounded tip to preserve the rounded appearance of the pin. If not, you can use a very light hammer, or something similar. In the past, I've use a tablespoon. A regular household hammer is way too big.  Peening is done with many light strokes, not a few big ones. A hard stroke will crush the mechanism and bend the pin. Expect to tap it fifty times or more. Lightly.  Every five or ten taps, check the blade. You don't want it too tight.  If the knife is valuable or old, it would be best to send it to a professional."

Bending it might cause the whole tip to crack off, and if it does you'll need to reprofile the tip with a file.   The last time I bent a tip back, it worked out well - I tapped the tip against a hard surface, over and over again like a drum stick. It's a hit or miss kind of thing."

knives,3ce939,kennethsime,3,Tue Jul 7 17:31:49 2015 UTC,"I couldn't find anything about the maker in a quick google search, but here's what I'll say.  It looks like the man knew what he was doing, it's not exactly easy to make a knife. It's especially not easy to make damascus from scratch, so to speak, if that's what he was doing.  Although the combo of 5160 and 15N20 is pretty common for damascus, I would probably choose a different steel for a knife I was going to put to work. One example would be Mcusta's damascus gentleman's knives, which have a core of vg-10 steel (which makes a very nice working steel).  It doesn't really matter if it's full-tang or not, what matters is if his chosen method of construction was done well or not. People who rail on and on about ""full-tang"" construction are used to cheaply-made import knives which quickly fall apart if they're not made from a single piece of steel. A well-made hidden-tang design will outlast many cheap full-tang designs."
knives,3ce939,kennethsime,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:05:18 2015 UTC,"To follow up on this, there are countless threads like this that have the same question: ""Hey guys, I bought this knife that I know almost nothing about, it is of high quality?"" This is a very difficult question to answer.  If you ask us about a regular-production knife such as a Buck 110, ""yes, that knife has been in production for 50 years and has a fairly good reputation."" Quality is relative; if you ask us about a Spyderco Tenacious, we could say something like ""yes, for $40.00 it's really hard to beat that knife."" However, if you ask us about a Chris Reeve Sebenza, some might say ""I wanted more for $400.00,"" while others will be quite pleased with their purchase.  Without knowing anything about your maker, seeing the knife in person, or using it over an extended period of time, it's really hard to say whether or not any of us would call it ""quality.""  Hope this helps."
knives,3ce939,kennethsime,2,Wed Jul 8 02:27:11 2015 UTC,"Yea I totally get that. Value is personal perception. The knife maker I bought it from has a profile page on LinkedIn (I know anyone can make a profile page.) I also found his name listed as a vendor at a knife show in Philadelphia. The reason I asked people's opinions is because I have only ever bought the big brand knives that you mentioned. And I wasn't 100% certain if the materials and grinding technique was high quality. I can say this though, this is the sharpest knife I have ever owned. And I do not think it's an Pakistan knife like some of the posts have said. I bought a few Pakistan knives before and they are definitely cheaply made. I should have a better understanding of how well it will work for me after this hunting season.

This knife has not been used but it has been in a display case for several years.  Blade length is 4"" and the overall length is 8.5"".  The steel used is 5160 (Spring Steel) and 15N20 (High Nickel Contrast Steel).    This pattern is a Firestorm pattern.   Included is a premium custom leather sheath made from heavy leather and fitted to this knife.  Handle material is Walnut with a Damascus steel finger guard.   No File work, rare if ever on my knives.  The knife has been tempered to 58c and has approximately 180 layers.  The hollow ground blade was done on a Bader 3 and an 8"" contact wheel.  This knife is a caping knife that is designed to make the proper cuts in game hide that is planned for taxidermy.  People today call it a gut hook but if you look carefully you will see the hook is flush with one side of the blade unlike a gut hook that is center ground.  I am a retired knife maker and started my business many years ago grinding and selling finished blades only and sold them mostly through a broker in England and New York but have sold hundreds of knives in the past 2 years and I have dismantled one more display case which housed 30 or so knives so they will be offered for sale because my knife shop and equipment have been sold.

knives,3ce939,Jake-from-state_farm,2,Tue Jul 7 05:57:51 2015 UTC,I personally love the look of Damascus steel. This one was made in the new Damascus steel making method by using the 2 different metals welded together and folded repeatedly to give you that Damascus look. The two steels he used in it are strong and flexible so there should be no problem there. I would say you made a good purchase as long as you like to look and feel of your blade.

Personally I hate that they matched a potentially really neat handle (if it is cool, it's the best thing about the knife) to a shitty shitty shit shit blade.  It would have been way cooler if it was an open-source handle tech they could sell to other companies or replace on other knives.  Because I don't like ANYTHING about those blades.  The steel is questionable, the heel of the blade has been ground to be useless, there's too much belly and upsweep, it's probably not convex, I doubt there's much distal taper, and I bet the heat treat is soft as bugger all, less than 60 hrc for sure."

Took 3 years before it got really loose, so I took it off, grabbed one end with pliers and slightly bent it back.  Reattached it and it was holding onto my pocket much better again.  All in all a great little knife that's just ultra practical.  Hell if you want to make your own, they let you do that on their site and only charge you $20 extra for a custom.

knives,3cc8j4,konzy27,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"Oh there are so many factors to be honest. And to be fair I carry anywhere from 2-3 on me most days. The 0566 is my constant and then I will rotate the rest depending on what I have going on. Typically the second that I have with me is either a Spyderco police, a tenacious or a Kershaw blur. If I am just hanging out and don't have much planned, I will carry my leek or crkt swindle or my Kershaw Emerson  colab (one of the cqc's, can't think which right now) but that can be a bit intimidating for most people. Anyway I digress. The 0566 is pretty compact, it is absolutely rock solid, holds an awesome edge with very little touch up needed. It just fits my hand perfectly. And then there is just that snap when you deploy the blade that is just so satisfying. And for a guy that likes to carry big knives ( resilience, police etc) it is still really satisfying. I don't know what else to say other than it is just a good complete package, from comfort, performance, and price. I highly highly recommend it.   If you can find a store locally that has one that you can handle, do it and decide for yourself. It was the first knife that I spent that kind of money on, which in the scheme of things is not that much, I could not have been more impressed."

knives,3cbe7d,iamda5h,3,Mon Jul 6 16:23:05 2015 UTC,"Honing, in this sense, is a maintenance method by which you straighten a rolled edge on a somewhat softer knife. The grooved rod catches the various teeth that make up the knife's edge and allows them to be bent back to true. The smooth hone is usually harder, in this case much heavier and sturdier, and is intended to be gentler on your edge because it won't take off those teeth. For what it's worth I've used a smooth F.Dick hone and the Victorinox Fibrox hone in comparison and never saw much of a difference in final results.

knives,3cbe7d,Kromulent,2,Mon Jul 6 19:58:41 2015 UTC,"A smooth steel burnishes the blade, rather than honing it. A rough or grooved steel, like these, acts sort of like a sharpening stone by scraping off some of the blade's metal. They are not ideal.  The trouble is that it is difficult to hold a steady angle from stroke to stroke, and at any given time there is only pinpoint contact between the blade and the rod."
knives,3cbe7d,UncannyGodot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:00:09 2015 UTC,"I've heard that for a long time and it seems sound, but after using both I don't know if I agree. The grooved rods do take off some errant metal, particularly if a knife wasn't deburred well, but I never saw a difference in edge retention between them. They both just straightened things out."
knives,3cbe7d,abstractattack,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"I don't have a lot of experience with the grooved variety so I can't really say. I was influenced a while back by a Bernard Levin article on the topic and never really explored it further.  I did have an inexpensive, grooved example that I could never get to work right, but I suppose that was not really a fair test.   Finding a good smooth steel was difficult, but I eventually found a vintage example on ebay for a decent price. I've since learned that ordinary carbide rods will generally work just as well.  Do you recall which brand worked well for you?"
knives,3cbe7d,abstractattack,2,Mon Jul 6 20:27:16 2015 UTC,"I hate to have to say it, but I get good results with most everything. I've had Mercer, Wusthof, and Victorinox hones, and used a few more besides, and can't tell a practical difference in them other than length. The Mercer hone has a nice handle. If you were using an old or particularly cheap hone it's possible the hone was too soft for the knife you were using, which does hurt your results.  I wouldn't move back to a grooved rod if a smooth rod is working for you and you're already invested. I did like using the F.Dick rod more than the alternatives and found it a bit more natural to use. The weight keeps it steadier and, as /u/abstractattack pointed out, consistent angle is key.  In all honesty I use a ceramic rod instead of a steel one, even on softer knives that can be honed. But more than that I just strop. Same effect, better and more repeatable results, kinder on your knife."
knives,3ccnec,EatCookieCrapThunder,5,Mon Jul 6 21:42:50 2015 UTC,"The GSD is pretty but the Griptillian is just a better knife in every other way.  154CM is a much better blade material than AUS-8.

The hole in the blade (like Spyderco's ""Spyder hole"") is used like a thumb stud.  I prefer the hole because it doesn't catch on things like sharpening stones."

knives,3ccnec,kennethsime,2,Tue Jul 7 06:37:50 2015 UTC,"154CM is already stainless so, unless you plan on getting it wet or coming in contact with corrosive agents a lot, N690 is not necessary and probably a downgrade in edge retention."

Is this a known model (kind of like Cold Steel Tai Pan is known)? Are there similar ones on the market? It's hard to google search for knife wide blade without catching a bunch of folding knives. I searched for Bolo knives but all of them are single-edged and usually sloping, kukri-style, not symmetrical like the above knife.  It's a big knife, looks to be around 15-20"" when held by the counter-sniper in fighting-grip.  Video link to full movie on youtube, knife is seen after 1:13:05."
knives,3cacuf,Ungoliantsspawn,3,Mon Jul 6 10:17:04 2015 UTC,"You're right that it isn't really a bolo, which I'm assuming is what they call it in the film. Bolos are usually single edged and widen toward the tip for additional weight.  That said, in the Philipines bolo can be used as a catch all term for a knife big enough to clear brush."
knives,3cbex6,Glitchsky,2,Mon Jul 6 16:28:36 2015 UTC,"Have a professional do it. If you try to do it yourself, or get someone inexperienced they could heat the blade up while grinding and ruin the heat treatment on it."
knives,3cbex6,robotdesignwerks,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:11:29 2015 UTC,Could I chill the blade first to mitigate the risk?
knives,3cbex6,UncannyGodot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:33:49 2015 UTC,You're only going to overheat it with the use of power tools. That's mitigated by going slow and constantly cooling the knife by dunking it in water. But it would be quite a challenging first task with such equipment.
knives,3cbex6,UncannyGodot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:09:59 2015 UTC,"I like a challenge and would have to accept the risk of replacing the blade (...can you buy just a replacement blade?). I'm masking out one of my cheapo knives now thinking about it. I'd get the grinder first, maybe another cheapo knife to practice on.  I'm still really curious what it would cost to have a pro do something like this too."
knives,3cbex6,UncannyGodot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:44:01 2015 UTC,"A belt sander would be the more kosher option. You can get one that's up to light reshaping from Harbor Freight for very reasonable prices. Be aware that even after you have the shape you want you'll probably have to do a lot of work thinning out the grind or the knife won't cut well.  You can, indeed, have the blade replaced if things go wrong. Benchmade does blade replacements for a reasonable fee.  For a pro I would dive into the various knife forums out there; I've never had anything like this done, but I'm guessing it would take an hour or two of work and minimal material inputs, so it shouldn't be ridiculous."
knives,3cbex6,UncannyGodot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:40:48 2015 UTC,"I'd want the angles to be dead on, so a jig would be a must. Could I make that work with a belt sander? Why not a Work Sharp as /u/Ulferor mentioned?  edit: just watched a video on the Work Sharp, I don't think that would get the surfaces and apexes as sharp as I'd want. More research needed. Also - check out the design I mocked up!"
knives,3cbex6,kennethsime,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:48:46 2015 UTC,"A Work Sharp would get the knife sharp, but we're talking about much more than sharpening. The guides would hurt you while reprofiling.  Speaking of reprofiling, if you just cut the edge deeper without thinning the grind you're going to have massive shoulders on the knife.  It will cause the bevels to look uneven and perform poorly. If you do grind it down you're going to strip off the coating.  As for the design, I wish you well and I'll offer the best advice I can, but I hate tanto tips. They lose functionality with no gain and they're a pain in the ass to sharpen."
knives,3cbex6,WhiteStripesWS6,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:04:27 2015 UTC,"I think I understand what you mean by massive shoulders, I tried to show a tip-bevel in my mock-up - did I get what you were talking about? I'd probably steer clear of the black blade to account for losing the coating.   I appreciate any input and criticism I can get. I'm here because you all know more than I do. This knife, for me, will be a usable art-piece as much as a knife. I work at a desk, won't be using it for a whole lot to be honest. Opening the occasional box and prying the occasional paint-can lid (KIDDING). I imagine it will last a very long time.   I am thinking more and more I should have a professional do it. I'm confident I can go slow and cautious, but imagine trying to get that end/shoulder bevel right would be incredibly difficult without botching it.  I'm curious; how is a tanto less functional?"
knives,3cbex6,Ulferor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:45:56 2015 UTC,"It would be somewhat difficult, but it's definitely not impossible. You would just have to go very slow. I would suggest blocking it out with a marker, many times, and taking it in stages. And I would definitely practice a few times on cheaper knives first. Since you're doing those things I think you'd be fine. It would make for a good project.  As for functionality, the American tanto tip purportedly offers better penetration than a continuous tip. I have never found peneteation to be lacking in any continuous edge so long at the tip is thin enough. The 940 and its siblings are fine on that point. Perhaps better penetration is in reference to the knife as a weapon. What is unquestionable is that you lose the ability to cleanly make a cut from the heel of the knife to the tip. The transition to the forward edge leaves you with, instead of one 3.25"" edge, one 2.75"" and one .5"" edge. Some tanto tips can also be fragile and they definitely suffer visually if the tip breaks off and you're obliged to repair it by cutting down the spine.  Thankfully for you its your knife. A large part of enjoying high end cutlery is personal preference. I endorse customization and embracing your preferences more than I care about the perfectly efficient knife. Frankly, anything past a Delica for most of us is just about making the user experience better."
knives,3cbex6,Ulferor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:42:47 2015 UTC,"I've thought a lot about how I could jig and clamp a blade for precision grinding. I live in a studio so large power-tools are out of the question, but I may yet find a solution. I have a Dremel, maybe I can find a guide of some sort for it. I do see your point about a continuous edge and the possibility of the tanto tip breaking ... what a terrible thought. I'd have to be prepared to have another blade made if it ever broke. I'm not worried about penetration, but I don't really need a long continuous cut either. I may end up getting an Urban Trapper first to quell my lust for a suit-knife, then work on a custom 943 slowly and methodically over time to be sure i'ts perfect. I've never understood why some people here have so many knives ... I may be getting sucked in!  *The Delica ... that nose makes me feel the same way as the nose of the 940 - I just can't look past it."

knives,3c9clf,nreyes238,2,Mon Jul 6 02:45:46 2015 UTC,"I've handled both and own the 940-1, and in my personal opinion which one you get depends on what you're looking for. A lot of people don't realize just how light weight the 940-1 is, as it's definitely quite a bit lighter than the 940. I personally bought it over the 940 for that very reason because I like how it just vanishes in the pocket (I also love carbon fiber so there's that), but in contrast the S90V takes considerably longer to sharpen than the S30V of the 940, so if you're planning to get it dull a lot (depends on type of intended use) then the 940 might be less troublesome to maintain. That being said S90V does hold an edge quite a long time.  As for buying... now that Benchmade is enforcing their minimum advertised pricing (MAP) with all vendors, if you really want to get the best deal than you must get either one off the secondary market. Plenty of people are selling them as they're both incredibly popular, and you can get a like new pre-owned/barely used one for much cheaper than any vendor will be selling them for."

On really busy days I'd have to sharpen them two or three times, depending on how much prep needed to be done. $50 for three is pretty pricey, you can usually find them for $6-8 at Asian markets. They are super easy to sharpen and actually hold an edge for quite a while (you can expect to get a case of onions, a case of carrots, and a case of celery all fine diced out of one sharpen) After 6 or 7 months the edge tends to become flat instead of slightly curved, and then you should replace them.

knives,3c61bn,accountonphone,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:02:10 2015 UTC,"I have the same issue in my family, many of whom have used dull blades almost exclusively for their entire lives. They usually learn a bit of respect after the first time they hurt themselves but after I noticed the trend, it almost seems like a bad idea to sharpen family knives because it's bound to cause injury. I always try to make a big deal about how sharp the knives are now and stress extra care, but it's hard to teach old people new tricks. But on the other hand they have all been minor cuts, so hopefully it's a learning experience that wards off more serious injury in the future.   That whole dull knives are more dangerous mantra is flawed, at least when it comes to accidental finger cutting in the kitchen."

If you have big hands it's hard to say just how excellent they are.  The Leek is aimed at a different purpose.  Whereas the Blur is a workhorse, the leek is more of a light duty knife.  Packages, cutting tape, you could use it to dress animals but metal handles don't lend themselves well to being wet.  The grip tape on the blur is phenomenal.    The walmart near me had the blue one on clearance for $50 and I missed it.    My recommendation would be; Blur first, Leek later.  The blur will do everything you need a knife to, you can get a leek as a light carry later since it can't handle the same vigors."

Its unknown by troops what steel was used, but they suspect its the same as that used to make Matchbox cars. It refuses to hold an edge and gets bent quite easily.  Its so awful, in fact, that Arrsepedia, the humorous guide to all things British military, as declared it to be a British Military Procurement Mystery, alongside the SA-80 itself.  In reality, its a pretty ambitious knife. The scabbard is a two-piece arrangement, where the hard plastic liner contains a hacksaw blade and a sharpening stone, and when connected to the knife via a cut-out in the blade, can be used as wire cutters.  better photos here"

knives,3c1zjo,UncannyGodot,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:04:38 2015 UTC,"Heh. It's probably because a santoku is a gyuto with a third of the knife taken off. The loss of a pronounced tip does limit the ability of the knife to do large ingredients and detail work, but it's nice that they need a little less space. A lot of chefs give them flack, but they're okay by me."
knives,3c1zjo,RefGent,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"It's important to realize what they are intended for. Santoku means 'three virtues' or the 'solution to three problems'. The three problems are slicing, dicing, and mincing vegetables, not chopping things, or slicing meat like the french chef or gyutos are intended to do. Expecting a santoku to function like a chef's knife is a surefire way to be disappointed."
knives,3c1zjo,UncannyGodot,3,Mon Jul 6 07:34:57 2015 UTC,"If you go by the etymology of Japanese kitchen knives you're going to be badly mislead regarding their use.  Both a gyuto and a santoku are all-purpose knives. Their name reflects the changing food culture of Japan when the knives were on the rise, at which time a lot of Western ingredients and techniques were entering the market. The gyuto profile was not designed with meat in mind, despite its name. It is, after all, just a chef knife, and a chef knife isn't really for meat either. The height on a gyuto that allows it to be used rapidly to evenly dice produce frankly hurts it in fabricating or sectioning proteins. Various boning knives and slicers will outperform it on those points, respectively. The only time I cut beef with a gyuto is cubing it for soup or grinding. And a santoku is less a tale of three virtues and more a tale of marketing in an effort to sell knives to the housewives of Japan. Prior to the introduction of Western double bevel knives Japanese kitchens had primarily used specific knives for specific tasks. For vegetables, you needed one knife. For fish, you needed a different knife or two. For chicken, you needed a different knife. The santoku's three virtues refer to its ability to perform adequately on all of these tasks, which is how it was and continues to be marketed.  More to the point is their actually use in the kitchen. A santoku can in fact be expected to perform as a gyuto and will do pretty well. The profile on gyuto and santoku mirror one another closely save the missing length, as do the grinds. In fact there is a lot of overlap in 180mm-210mm gyuto and santoku that would allow many to be labeled as either. They vary in technique a bit as a santoku does necessitate a bit more push cutting, but push cutting is in vogue right now anyway. I will admit I miss the tip when I use a santoku, though. Gyuto tend to be ground quite thin there and that makes for easy work through dense product.  As for people not liking the santoku, I think it generally comes down to familiarity. And many Western cooks equate weight with solidity and quality in kitchen knives, which you're obviously not going to get in a santoku. But that doesn't translate well to actual use, where they are quite capable."
knives,3c1zjo,RefGent,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:15:07 2015 UTC,"You get an upvote. In regard to the chef style of the french and gyuto slicing meat, I did mean in an allrounder capacity as we are talking about all-purpose knives. The extra length of the chef lends itself to be better at slicing meat than a santoku."
knives,3c1zjo,fiskedyret,2,Mon Jul 6 14:37:03 2015 UTC,"The lack of belly in the blade is due to the japanese mainly using a push cut instead of a rocking motion when slicing veggies. the lack of tip is because the nakiri is a veggie knife, its only really used for prep, so you do a lot of scooping with the knife, which the tip isnt all that useful for."

They can also eat bone tissue, but it takes longer and doesn't give them the nutrition they need to stay in our world.  They must consume flesh somewhat often to maintain their power.  Over time, the spirits will weaken and enter a dormant state.  This is why older KABAR knives will not consume the user if they cut themselves on it when taking it out of long-term storage.  The blood WILL wake the demons up, but not very quickly.  Future injury can trigger their feeding frenzy, though."

If you leave it on it'll make a varnish like finish which will give you hot spots or blisters.  Wire wool is a great thing to keep in your inventory. I've been using it for years, as long as I can remember actually. One pack should last years. I like fine stuff. A bit of wd40 or white sprit on it and it will really clean up carbon steels.  You can also get a thing called a blade rubber. It's cheap and removes rust off blades, in fact it'll even polish off a patina off a blade. Just mind your fingers when using it. I saw someone chop off a big chunk of skin off a finger as he used it on a knife I had recently sharpened for him, still razor sharp, but had a patina as he cut some onions and the got some brown sauce on it. The 20 odd stitches and tetanus jab later he now has a true respect for my sharpening skills. I did warn him it was a lot sharper than he had ever got it as I've been free had sharpening for about 25 years now. Plus I do go a bit anal when sharpening. Up to 6000 grit and stropped to oblivion."

knives,3byj8m,vertebrate,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:29:26 2015 UTC,"My experience (not that you asked, but hey) is that the handle feels too narrow, and when you grip it tight, the whole handle flexes a little too much.  Additionally, and this might just be the way I flip the knife, the blade is basically a cam, which when deployed flexes the frame, and there are times when my fingers are a little pinched.  So my overall impression is that this is not a serious knife.  I don't use it, but I do like to look at it.  It is a beautiful looking knife, much larger than I expected, and the blade is gorgeous and heavy."

Yeah, they have downsides, but just about every other style of knife has its downsides. The most common argument against using a balisong is that they're undesirable self defense weapons because of the requirement of fine motor skills in a stressful and unforgiving environment. Yes, this is true, but this is an argument that implies other knives are good self defense options - which is frequently argued against as well. I've yet to hear a strong argument against a balisong to really sway me at all."

It's a tool to me, like any other knife, and in that aspect it has many redeeming qualities. I enjoy flipping and in my work I have to open lots of boxes on a regular basis and once you do start to EDC you really start to see lots of uses for carrying a knife. While I hope that I never do have to use it in a self-defense scenario, that split second extra it may take me to open it likely isn't going to be my undoing.

knives,3bwi89,iamstealthor,3,Fri Jul 3 13:10:07 2015 UTC,"Been debating buying this knife for at least the last year, OP please convince me. How do you feel about it?"
knives,3bwi89,iamstealthor,3,Fri Jul 3 01:01:52 2015 UTC,"It's a very solid flipper, it feels great in the hand, and is as smooth as butter. Picture a knife that opens as smooth as possible, and it's smoother. The latching mechanism is fantastic. It has a spring preventing the latch from getting in the way during spinning, and that allows faster one handed opening by simply squeezing the two handles and it will pop out. It did feel a bit wiggly but that's simply due to the nature of the knife and that I haven't applied loctite to the threads (I highly recommend it for ALL balisongs, it keeps them at the perfect tightness for flipping so it doesn't loosen over time). Now when I said the knife was smooth, I was talking about its opening and closing, however, the blade is exceptionally sharpened out of the box and sleek to the touch on the sides and spine. The pocket clip is removable and reversible (I'm almost 100% sure it's reversible). The clip is very strong. It will not accidentally fall out, and you will notice a bit of a struggle if someone tried to pickpocket you. The blue accents look great with the black G10, and the spear point blade looks amazing as well. I realize my argument wasn't very good, because I definitely could have spent much more time on this. These were my first thoughts about the knife, and I think it's worth the purchase if you have the money and want a quality balisong. If you'd like to try out flipping, I suggest getting a cheap $10-15 balisong first before you spend $240 on a knife only to find out you don't enjoy flipping the blade. Also, the knife is much larger than I expected. It's not a bad thing, I was just surprised when I opened the box because most of my other balisongs have been smaller (and far cheaper)."

knives,3c0kne,themaggic,2,Fri Jul 3 22:09:52 2015 UTC,The seal series are solid knives i have owned all of them my favorite being the seal pup elite. The seal team elite is quite beefy and strong it is a full tang knife which is awesome and the nylon sheath is ambidextrous. My one gripe about the seal team elite is that its huge it really is not practical yet it would shine in a combat and most survival situations (to be expected) the seal pups are way more practical and ergonomic in my opinion just remeber they are half tang knives so if you start really prying on something it is a possibility that you will snap the handle in half. That being said seal pup elite is my suggestion its has good strength nice feel and is good with precise work.

That's the primary problem with sharpmaker, 'cause it has fixed angles (30 and 40 degrees). Check each angle, start with 30. Marker indicates if stone touched the edge or not.   If it's not touching at 40 degrees and you have only medium+fine set - you are out of luck a bit. Use edges of the medium stones to get to the edge (you can set 30 degrees angle: it should take much more time at first, but sharpening in future will be much more easier).   Anyway, good luck."

knives,3bwyuw,I_die_to_BS,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:32:35 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend one with a blade similar to this but not necessarily that particular knife.  The reason I suggest that blade design is that it gives you what you might consider two points for cutting, the tip can be used for the plunge (stabbing) cut and the second for trimming tape or opening boxes with more control.  Hope that makes sense and helps  Edit: down vote for making a suggestion that fits OPs criteria? Wow so what is your stirling suggestion then?"

knives,3bwyuw,blitz331,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:24:18 2015 UTC,"My guess is the downvotes are for the crappy knife linked. I personally would never recommend a half serrated blade, or a tanto (unless you stab a lot of stuff with it), but if it works for OP then that's what matters."
knives,3bwyuw,KamaKaZzie,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:59:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah the overall kinfe is crap, ( jenfe my comment ""not nessarily this prticular knife"") however the blade design does fit OP's requirements. Aserrated blade is highy desirable if you are cutting nylon reinforced packing tape."
knives,3bwyuw,blitz331,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:55:01 2015 UTC,"There's really no need to the partial serrations, a properly sharpened blade will cut easier than serrations ever will.

knives,3bxnw2,Glitchsky,4,Fri Jul 3 00:27:10 2015 UTC,Maybe a benchmade 940 or a stryker tanto. I would recomend the 940 unless you are set on a tanto.

knives,3bxnw2,theprofromdover,2,Fri Jul 3 16:52:11 2015 UTC,A small tanto Sebenza 21 has everything you want. It is a frame lock so if that doesn't do it for you it may mean a pass. New they are in the high $300s but used you can generally find them near $300.I have a couple of CRKs and like them very much.

knives,3bsl9w,paygun68,3,Wed Jul 1 21:23:41 2015 UTC,it was a propane forge and a proper anvil. i don't remember the steel it was over a year ago i will have to email the guy i made it with to remind me. hammered it down to around 1 to 1.5mm then belt sander to make the edge then sharpened with stones and a strop. bloody keen edge for such a big thing.

You have to be diligent with scale removal after heats and before hammering. The scale builds up and is beaten into the steel, leaving depressions."
knives,3bsl9w,carlEdwards,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:20:09 2015 UTC,"Ohh absolutely, I realised I was making that mistake straight after I had finished the shaping process. But it does not bother me too much. I have since made an axe/tomahawk and I defiantly didn't make that mistake again. It's pretty much scale free. It's just a matter of getting confident with the materials and comfortable with the techniques."
knives,3bsl9w,batterrier,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:22:04 2015 UTC,"I remember hearing about knives from...I think it was Siberia. They intentionally hollow one side of the knife, kinda like those depressions have, while leaving the other flat or convex or whatnot. Sometimes they'll add etching or artwork in the hollow.  Point being, I heard that the shape of the sides actually affected how ice and such formed between sheath and knife, and helped keep them from freezing in.   Just a thing!"
knives,3bsl9w,ZeeyardSA,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:32:36 2015 UTC,It has those depressions on both sides. It's just where some scale has been hammered in and then bits have come away. It doesn't really affect the overall blade shape on either side.

knives,3bt6cq,Bigsasquatch,2,Thu Jul 2 13:41:27 2015 UTC,The best places to get them is where they recently replaced tracks.  They seem to just throw them down in huge piles every so often. As far as I know it's illegal to trespass on a railroad but I walk along side them when I pick them up.  I've tried making several tomahawks with the spikes but I haven't perfected that yet haha

knives,3bt0rl,mikefitz23,2,Wed Jul 1 22:20:51 2015 UTC,"Decided I needed to carry a fixed blade, so I looked around online and landed on the Saddle Mountain Hunter with composite grips from Benchmade. First, the blade is sharp from the factory but not scary sharp; passes the paper push test, fails the hair shaving test (for what its worth). The knife is very attractive, in my opinion, which was important to me in this purchase. The wood grips just look classy, and are grippier than I expected. S30V steel, 'nuff said.   I really like how low the sheath rides on the belt, I'm pretty sensitive to things poking me in the side (sorry for the dog hair: http://i.imgur.com/9F5oI4O.png ). Another thing I like is the ""narrowness"" of the blade and sheath; I can fit my leatherman and the knife between one set of belt loops on any of my pants. Finally, I also like the fact that with a typical shirt of mine (Carhartt T, long polo) I can completely conceal the sheath, it comes about 3/4"" short of the bottom of my shirt.   Anyway, haven't done much field testing (other than slicing some potatoes earlier), I can say I like the thinness and flat grind of the blade, I think it will excel at EDC stuff."

A lot of people just get a green mora companion in stainless and never look through their other products, if you go to their website and look through what they have you might find something a little more to your liking, note they don't actually sell anything on their site and you just buy it by copy and pasting the name of the product into Amazon, Mora has so much to offer and I don't want you to just look at the companion and forget the company all together, you said you were looking at the Bear Grylls knives, as others have j would advise against that, if you like the design of it, Mora has something very similar (with better steel) for the same price as well.

knives,3btbqy,eleventytwelv,2,Thu Jul 2 02:16:09 2015 UTC,Free hand sharpening is incredibly difficult. The sharpmaker is essentially idiot proof.
knives,3btbqy,eleventytwelv,3,Thu Jul 2 04:10:46 2015 UTC,"As a beginner, its recommended that you use burr based sharpening while learning - this means sharpen one side until you get a noticeable burr along the entire edge of the blade, Then sharpen the other side until you again get a burr along the whole blade. Then work to remove the burr.  Get yourself a decent stone, look up some YouTube videos of good freehand sharpeners and try to emulate their form. Good inexpensive stones to start are norton india or crystalon combination stones (oil stones), or maybe a king 250/1000 grit stone if you want to try out water stones (but then prepare to buy additional supplies and spend time to flatten them).  I'd reccomend browsing videos from mredgy, korin sharpening, carter cutlery, and jdavis. There are plenty more.

knives,3bpghq,UserM16,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:16:54 2015 UTC,"Cuts better? How's that exactly? I find the ESEE 6 too large for most jobs around a camp as it becomes too unwieldy for a lot of small carving tasks. Plus any jobs the 6 can do, the 5 can do as well. You lose an inch of thickness on logs you can baton, but if you need the ESEE 6 to baton a log, you need an axe anyway. Additionally the 5 could still baton the same log, you'd just have to hit the handle which is only slightly annoying. I see no downsides to its thickness either."

The Junglas, which is their longest blade, is only 3/16 of an inch, which is sufficient for strength.  The ESEE 5 (I hear) was designed to be able to stab through airplane and helicopter skins among other things.  The thickness doesn't help your average user though, and makes the knife a boat anchor for every other task.  Honestly, my favorite ESEE is the 3.  People are turned off because they think it's gonna be small but it's not, it has a 3.5+ inch blade, it's only an 1/8 of an inch thick, and its only 5.2 ounces.

The Hinderers, on average, seem just a titch more heavy duty, but that's not a big deal to me. I've never broken any knife under hard use, so I'm not too worried about it. Anyway, the ZTs are usually 1/2 the price. I honestly can't think of a reason why I'd buy another Hinderer, other than the ""cool factor."""

knives,3bnolu,literal_humor_guy,5,Tue Jun 30 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain, why fixed knives are generally more expensive than folders in the same class? It makes zero sense to me. Like this one: it is a great knife and all, but for its price I can buy two Rat 1 knives, and still have like 10 bucks left. And I assume that it takes more effort to produce a folder with all the mechanics and parts that needs to be precisely manufactured and properly assembled, while fixed blade is pretty basic. So, what am I missing?"
knives,3bnolu,berest,2,Wed Jul 1 02:02:53 2015 UTC,1) RAT 1 is a cheaper metal.  2) RAT 1 has less metal 3) RAT 1 has less Micarta (if the scales are even Micarta)  The reason fixed blades are more because it requires more of an expensive material. Simple as that.
knives,3bnolu,crazzyazzy,0,Sun Jul 5 18:40:25 2015 UTC,"Right, but folder requires more complex/expensive manufacturing process. I also don't believe that micarta contributes much into the final price, there are quite a few cheap folders with micarta scales out there. Another example, let's take a look at Spydeco: you can have a decent vg10 folder for around $65 (Endura 4). Now good luck finding a fixed blade Spyderco for less than $100 - closest would probably be ""Bill Moran"", which retails for about ~$100, a small knife made from the same vg10."
knives,3bnolu,berest,3,Sun Jul 5 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"CNC machines can pump out those complex parts very quickly. All you need to do is load up the template and run it with the stock material. Once the materials are produced, assembly is probably a matter of minutes. So two knives, a fixed blade and a folder, using the same metal, say VG10, the fixed blade is going to cost more because it needs more VG10 if it's a full tang fixed blade. The folder requires only the length of the blade of VG10. When you lay out the template on a sheet of metal, you can make a lot more folders than fixed blades. So the point still stands, more metal, more money."
