It woke me up in San Jose and did some minor, yet not insignificant damage to our house. Had to have the chimney demo'd last week because it was wrenched about an inch from the house during that quake. We start retrofitting the foundation next week thanks to some shifting in the foundation which was also exacerbated by the Napa quake.

I've had dozens of conversations over the last few years about how sometimes all we really want is an iced coffee and one of the breakfast bagels/breakfast sandwiches.   To be honest, it is probably more of a nostalgia thing for many of us. I personally become giddy whenever I see one in an airport or when I'm traveling, but don't go more than a couple of times when I am back home (Maine). It is also a pretty solid breakfast for $6."

This means that the dude has absolutely no idea what he's getting into. Opening nine formula retail stores in San Francisco in this day and age is a feat due to both the expenses involved in leasing San Francisco real estate and the difficulties of obtaining San Francisco permits. It's not a way to start a profitable business. The only other  chain who has done anything like this recently was Quickly, and we all know what happened there.  I strongly suspect Bhatt visited San Francisco, was shocked that there were no Dunkin Donuts here, has some leverage from his prior successful developments and experience with Dunkin, and thought ""how hard can it be?"" It can be hard, Nick. It can be very hard. I wish you luck, and you're going to need it.  I mean, we don't even have a single Psycho Donuts in this city! What's up with that?

It's possible. That's kinda what happened with 8 Washington. A bunch of rich people wanted their views preserved, so they got their PR to spin it as ""save the waterfront from evil developers"" and the public believed it. However, the most likely scenario is that people don't understand supply & demand. The cause/effect is happening at the same time, so it looks to them that new luxury developments are causing prices to go up, instead of high prices making it profitable to build luxury developments. They see the lack of new building as a way to stop people from wanting to move to the Mission.   If you believe stopping construction will lower rents, wouldn't it also make sense to tear down existing housing, to really have an effect?   They want to keep existing residents, so they wouldn't be in favor of that. Though if you made it so that only luxury housing got torn down, there would be lots of support."

In fact, residents have witnessed for years the results of a failure to build.

Demand is just that high.   If you believe it's worthwhile to have more lower cost housing as soon as possible, then the only solution is to get developers to include more below market rate units.

sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,acgourley,4,Tue Jul 21 01:58:42 2015 UTC,"My chief issue with requiring some percentage of 'affordable' housing is that it explicitly divides housing in the city between economic classes, and really gouges out any semblance of a bridge between them.

This projects are huge. So really this will only effect future midsize projects which means just a handful of affordable housing units. The math doesn't make sense. Typed on a tiny keybroard."

Right now, the moratorium is demanding everything and agreeing or promising nothing. The activists might later offer something in return for a moratorium. As I understand it now, it's a moratorium and nothing.   This moratorium gives the city time and eventually leverage to demand more affordable units be built in each development.

They could just chuck it later? Even then, the wording is about not increasing the supply but making 50% of the units be affordable. Affordable by what measure?

sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,CowWithBeef,6,Tue Jul 21 06:26:33 2015 UTC,"Not sure if serious, but just in case you are: below market rate units are units where the owner is only allowed to charge for them an amount that is considered affordable to a certain income bracket based on a percentage of ""area median income,"" usually 60%-120% of area median income. People are selected to live in these units through a lottery run by the mayor's office of housing open only to people whose income is in the target range of percent area median income. Every developer of market rate housing for projects over five units has to include a certain percentage of BMR units, usually 12% but sometimes higher."

But, I've come to accept that most of those will be forced to leave.  I'll dutifully cast my vote against the moratorium.  But honestly I know that things will have to get worse then they are now before the city tackles the issue of constructing enough housing for its residents in a serious way.   Which means that the best thing that could happen is for the moratorium to pass and for other neighbourhoods to follow suite by correctly pointing out that it's unfair for them to have to pick up the slack because the Mission got special treatment.

sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,ShitsInPringlesCans,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:31 2015 UTC,"SF doesn't have to do anything.  We could easily continue on the path we're on.  However, people generally seem to agree on a few high-level goals for the city:   Rent should be cheaper We'd like to avoid long-term residents of the city getting kicked out   The way to accomplish both of these goals is to increase the housing supply.  If there were more available housing, rent would decrease, and there'd be less pressure to evict or price out existing residents.  There are a lot of ways to accomplish increasing the housing supply, but removing barriers to new construction is one of the more common suggestions.  On the other hand, if we continue on the path we're on, rent will continue to increase until only the quite wealthy can afford to live near the city.  In economics 101 terms, the price will increase and demand will decrease (as a result of the price increase) until an equilibrium is reached.  It's not clear where that equilibrium is, but there's no sign that we're close yet.  People generally seem to agree that that's the worse possible outcome, since it fails #1 and #2, while at the same time changing a lot of what people like about SF: the character, the people, the groups and institutions (many of which will have been priced out by the time we reach equilibrium).  So, to answer your questions:   SF must build more housing to achieve the above stated goals. It's more a ratio of demand for living space vs available supply of living space.  Our demand is much higher than the supply.  Increasing the supply would address this.  So would letting the price rise. Yes, a lot of people want to live here.  As the prices increase, basic economics would dictate that fewer people want to live here.  There are a lot of non-basic-economics complicating factors, but that's the simple version. Sorry for not following, but I don't see how nation-wide housing regulation plays into this.  Are you arguing that there should be no housing regulation anywhere, or that there should be more, or that we should change regulations elsewhere to affect demand here, or what?"

sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,BeABetterHumanBeing,-13,Mon Jul 20 21:15:34 2015 UTC,"If we fail to build more housing, prices will keep increasing, until the ""urban renewal"" trend of the mid-90s reverses (note: the urban decay trend took 50 years to reverse).  I own a home and have two kids in public school.  As prices increase, families are forced out.  Renters sooner or later have to deal with ellis acts or family growth.  As other families are forced out, we lose our social support structure.  That's not a joke; we have no family here (like many) and so our friends are our families.  This makes it harder and harder for us to stay.  We are expanding, to build an additional bedroom.  As housing costs rise, so are building costs.  Our new bedroom addition is going to cost more than what I had the entire structure insured for in 2002.  That's insane.  I don't want to have to pull my kids out of school and find a new job because we can't fit in this house anymore.  Another reason is the ""soul"" of the city.  So many people come in here complaining about ""manhattanization"" of SF.  But the thing is, the people make SF what it is.  I like the fog and the hills and the Victorians, but I love the people here.  As prices rise wihtout new units, people are replaced.  When that happens, the new residents don't take on the soul of the older city, things change.  Now, I'm not  passing judgement on the newbies.  I love change.  But I would like to see some of that social personality transferred to the new caretakers rather than replaced.  Lastly, I'll just say this... we have plenty of room to grow upward, without sacrificing what makes SF what it is.  There are areas in the Richmond and the Sunset, even down by me here in Glen Park that can take on higher density without destroying what we have.  But we have to plan for it, we have to create infrastructure and deal with transit and all that good stuff- we just can't ignore it.  The other thing that people don't get... we're not fighting to save people who live in the mission now.  We're fighting for the people there in 5-10 years.

Becoming ""cool"" is a side effect of the job and affluence growth  South of market and parts of the mission were gentrified in the first tech boom in the early 2000s.  Then rents slowed until the current tech boom, which is much more broad based."

When job availability starts to match housing availability. People may always want to live here but they won't be able to unless they have a job. It's not the raw desire to live here that's driving up prices, it's runaway job growth paired with no new substantial housing development.   2) Given that there are already restrictions on the use of the Ellis Act (and more in legislation at the moment), it seems already pretty limited. Apart from this, why shouldn't people who own property (of any type) be able to do with it what they wish?   It's limited but even in its limited state Ellis Act evictions are occuring all the time in San Francisco. Don't get confused and think I'm saying landlords shouldn't be able to evict. What I'm saying is that they wouldn't want to evict if market rate rents weren't so disparate from rent controlled rents from even a couple years ago. If we'd built housing to meet demand starting 10 years ago, we wouldn't be seeing rampant evictions because the incentive wouldn't be there."

sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,dboy999,2,Mon Jul 20 20:32:55 2015 UTC,"Is there a specific ratio between jobs available and housing by distance between which needs to be met?   Actually, yes! Your intuition is correct.    Honestly, is this just a case of 'a lot of people want to live here'?   Mostly, I think so. Whether it is because of an increase in money around or an increase of people wanting to buy is not totally irrelevant. It does have a similar conclusion, however. The price of housing is communicating to us the willingness of a people to spend their money on a house at that price. That's what price really is: the information of the urgency of a product or good.  SUPPLY and DEMAND CHART  Take a look at this chart: http://i.imgur.com/4YIRhNI.gif  The chart is a sort of model of the housing market in SF. The bottom axis shows the quantity of housing and the left hand axis going up and down is the price. The price can be all over for different units, but these charts are for the aggregate of a market. Maybe the cost in dollars per square foot for residential houses. It's a simplification to be sure, but it's a model we can look at and examine closely.  The red line marked D1 is representative of the demand in the past. The D2 line represents demand now. The Blue line represents supply of housing.  The black dots where they intersect is the price at a given quantity of available housing. We want the price of housing to go lower.  From the time when the demand was less, the D1 line, we can see the price and supply was also lower. Now, at the D2 line, the price is also higher. So is supply, but only at the higher price. Apartments can rent for more. Houses bought with mortgages 30 years ago were far, far lower priced than they are today.   At the higher demand, the $1 million dollar selling price of a house will make some people decide to sell and move to Portland.  Now at D2, the demand is higher, and so is the price. The supply of housing hasn't really changed. People are more willing to sell, but only at the much higher price. The demand just seems to keep pouring in. People from all over the world will just keep paying $1 million or more for a 2 bedroom, it seems. The demand increase will stop sometime but it's already too high.  Some of these people are buying places sight-unseen. It's an investment vehicle and a place to keep money. They're not here for the ambiance of the city. Others are here because their job is here. Paying an extra $1,000 a month in rent is a fair price to not have to commute an extra three hours per day for some. San Francisco is a nice city to live and work in, if you can afford it.  POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS  So how do we reduce price? Could the city institute a visa system to say who can and cannot live here to reduce demand? It seems unlikely. If we can't affect the demand, then we have to look at supply. If we could make a new supply line, moved to the right and call it S2, the price would go down.  It's a difficult balancing act because housing developers have to make a profit -- this is their job and they need to make a living, too. Some ways could be subsidies from the city or possibly state government. Others would be simplifying building codes. It's hard to make a medium sized or middle income  housing development because of the administrative costs and lawsuits from neighbours would be too costly. So, they either revamp a single family house and push the price way up (because it was already expensive to buy a fixer-up special) or build some gargantuan luxury tower type situation.  I earlier mentioned the supply is up but only from the price change. To really see the supply increase like we want, we need to move the blue line to the right, like we did with the red line. Only by new construction of more dense housing.  CONCLUSIONS  It may already be too late to do much because people hate to see the value of their house fall. There'd be political fallout for those in city hall. Also, there are city planning headaches to higher housing density, such as transit, and traffic, where to put bars and loud venues. The situation we have now is the result of multiple layers of poor planning. The affected citizens are too disorganized and seemingly ill-informed about the nature of the market forces working against them. Developers need to make a profit, and it's hard to do so in a way that meets the city's needs. When prices are set higher, they have a hard time coming back down. Some means of meeting all of these actor's goals needs to be found, but I worry it's too late.  The current housing situation is a convolution of economics, failures in local San Francisco and regional bay area planning, poor mass transit infrastructure, an aversion to taxes from the populace, the concentration of wealth in fewer hands, interest rates being low, quantitative easing from the Federal government, actors at the local, state, and federal level all acting in conflicting or self interests. They're nuanced and complex problems, and at present, San Francisco Bay area governments are not dealing with them well. In fact, most American cities are not.  I dunno about you, but I'd much rather keep the people living in the mission and have the character of the buildings change than loose the people, too."

sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,b_m_hart,9,Mon Jul 20 20:17:09 2015 UTC,"They're also concerned about Ellis Act evictions. I've heard lots of nonsense about 'greedy landlords' using the Ellis Act to evict tenants and either go condo or tear the building down for development. Basically, (it seems) they want to make the neighborhood so hostile to development that no one bothers to build anything new.  There's also the contingent that wants to get rid of all luxury housing in favor of below market rate housing. This one I sort of get as I remember seeing million dollar luxury condos being built in NYC when I was growing up and wondering why they didn't build housing for normal people. Then I took an economics class. It's naive to think someone isn't going to build luxury housing if there's a demand for it. We're all better off if it gets built anyways. Does anyone really think someone that makes $500k/yr wants to live in an unrenovated victorian rather than a brand new building with all the amenities?"

So, on average, 0.3% of all units are cleared out by owners.  There is no ""eviction epidemic"", it's simply people using a wedge issue and riding it as hard as they possibly can."
sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,yourparadigm,8,Mon Jul 20 20:43:52 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you. Evictions in SF are basically a rounding error.

I know there really isn't a model for it, but isn't that correlation not the selling point of development? i.e. build something nice and new, and the demand for it will push up value?   I know in SF it's about catching up with demand, but until housing supply is sufficient, I would think that opening a new building would cause spikes in those neighborhoods, while relieving pressures in others as renters start shifting around."
sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,runamok,4,Mon Jul 20 22:08:53 2015 UTC,"I think you have it backwards -- increased housing prices spur more development, not the other way around. The prices are increasing partly because of demand, and partly because there's been a reduced supply over the last several years. The reduced supply is caused partly by NIMBYism and partly because the cost of development is particularly high in SF (due to land and permitting costs). Developers see the signs of new potential profit and want in on the action, therefore building more."
sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,needbubbles2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:20:24 2015 UTC,"As someone that lives on the peninsula and works in SF I will try to give as objective a response as I can though I am firmly in the ""build more because rents and houses are astronomical"" camp.  SF is a very ""quaint"" city. Few things are over a few stories high.  The panoramas are nice and we have few skyscrapers. There are all sorts of rules about whether you can interrupt the views of others. So the incumbents that have been here for a long time don't want to build up or build tons of condos because they feel that will change the feel of the city and further increase traffic, stress services, etc. You could argue that they are part of why the city is cool and unique and if we go nuts with unrestrained growth we lose some of what makes SF unique. The place is constrained on 3/4 of the perimeter so something needs to change I would posit.   This article gives some perspective of how tough and expensive it is to actually build anything which of course makes it more costly to the end user. http://www.spur.org/publications/article/2014-02-11/real-costs-building-housing  Prop 13 in California also helps incumbents and hurts newcomers. The thought process though is that ""you lived here your whole life,you paid your taxes, why should we push you out when you want to retire and not work full time"".

sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,yourparadigm,0,Mon Jul 20 21:41:35 2015 UTC,"So, ignoring your snarky jabs at my honest questions, if you artificially increase supply (by building), prices go down - but only so long as the supply outstrips the demand. So when does the building stop? And why wouldn't doing a bunch of building ultimately mess things up? Certainly cramming too many people in to San Francisco would cause the city to lose what charm it has left. Then people would want to move out, and they city would be stuck with a bunch of empty apartments. As this cycle deepens, it winds up being Detroit (obviously I'm exaggerating here)."
sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,b_m_hart,2,Mon Jul 20 21:58:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's clarify some concepts and facts:  1) A government regulating market forces is what makes a supply/demand change artificially.  2) Developers who want to build on land with the desire to sell it after construction are not artificially increasing supply -- they are the natural part of this economic exchange.  3) SF has been artificially restricting building in the city for the last 10 years  4) There is naturally high demand to live in and around SF. (It's a great place with great weather, good services, and various other perks that people want in their city).   Certainly cramming too many people in to San Francisco would cause the city to lose what charm it has left.   5) SF is far below the density of most major cities. Cities also don't stay static and are constantly evolving. This so-called ""charm that SF is losing"" is the exact same reasoning as parents lamenting music of their children not being as great as when they were kids. It's a silly feeling of nostalgia that each generation creates for itself and should not be used to guide law and instigate force against others.   Then people would want to move out, and they city would be stuck with a bunch of empty apartments.   6) The demand to live in SF is not going to decrease. It would take a monumental ecological disaster to do something like that to SF.    Detroit   7) Detroit has had issues for many reasons, none of them related to too much housing. Their economy was dependent on a single segment of industry (automobiles). SF does not have this problem as it has a very diversified portfolio of jobs (tourism, computer tech, bio tech, finance, etc). Detroit's weather is also atrocious and nothing like SF.  If you are confused about what I said or disagree with any of my points, I'm happy to clarify or debate."

sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,b_m_hart,3,Mon Jul 20 20:43:08 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of that has got to do with the borders of SF being so narrowly defined.

sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,FishToaster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:25:20 2015 UTC,"No, it eventually just hits an equilibrium. You don't have thousands of people move into an increasingly dense city suddenly all leave because one too many people arrived. There are only so many people who DO want to live here, only so many tech jobs to fill. We WILL hit an equilibrium of one kind or another: either with a higher population or higher rents. Maintaining both low supply of housing and low housing costs is just not possible without doing something much less attractive. Detroit didn't collapse because too many people wanted to live there or the prices got too high. Car companies laying off their entire workforces is what happened to Detroit."
sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,General_Mayhem,4,Tue Jul 21 15:49:38 2015 UTC,"I think craigiest largely hit the nail on the head, but I feel I should elaborate:  1  The building doesn't stop unless people stop wanting to live here.  That's how human settlements work.  If you look at population charts for any given city, they tend to rise over time.  In fact, when the population of a city flatlines or decreases, it's generally considered a sign of poor health.  Ideally, we build to keep pace with demand, but right now we're so far behind that we need to build a lot just to catch up.  2  ""Ultimately messing things up"" is something that a lot of development opponents are worried about.  I can totally sympathize: people come to SF for it's charm.  People don't want an urban dystopia- they want the small city feel.  They worry (and not without warrant) that we'll end up in a city that feels like Manhattan: giant towers everywhere, and super-dense.  However, you really have to consider what the alternative is.  The charm of this city isn't the buildings, it's the people.  If rent continues to increase, more and more people will be priced out.  You'll end up with only one kind of people left: the wealthy.  Now, the wealthy aren't inherently evil or anything, but the variety of people in this city is what gives it its character.  Filtering out everyone that's not upperclass will mess things up way more than increased building.  So: more building might harm the city's charm.  Less building (and thus ever higher rents) will definitely kill the city's charm.  More building at least gives us some control, and lets us try to build in a way that preserves the afformentioned charm.  As a final aside: building more apartments isn't artificially increasing supply- it's just increasing supply.  That's how supply normally increases- building more  :)"
sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,bmc2,2,Tue Jul 21 01:51:04 2015 UTC,"one kind of people left: the wealthy   Also the homeless, the denizens of the more stubborn SROs, and the few working poor who won the BMR lottery. Not a lot of middle class, though."
sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,sfthrow87,3,Mon Jul 20 20:36:40 2015 UTC,"This is basically the history of cities around the world here. London wasn't always the home to millions of people. Ditto for NYC and every other city on earth. SF is growing and we need to house people somewhere. Putting our heads in the sand and refusing to build anything new only results in stratospheric housing costs.   Building stops when there's an equilibrium in the market. If we don't have expanding industry in the area, there's no need for more housing, and developers don't build any more since it's not profitable to do so.  Detroit had nothing to do with the city being too dense, over building, or anything of that nature. Detroit happened because all of the major employers in the area refused to face reality and fix their products. The Japanese ate their business, the companies laid off a ton of people, and the rest is history. The only way we could become detroit is if business left the area. Theoretically, if prices get so high that no one can afford to live here anymore, the Bay Area stops becoming an attractive area, and industry moves somewhere else. Prices would drop, but when the center of the tech universe has moved elsewhere, it isn't coming back."

There is a lot of wealth down there and the residents have been even more resistant to development than San Francisco.

sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,swolesister,2,Tue Jul 21 05:54:45 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, then that statement doesn't fit what we're discussing - since this article and our comments are clearly discussing the housing shortage and rising rents in San Francisco. And this article is specifically on the Mission.  So if you're attempting to create a closed economic model where rents in San Francisco will rise until they meet the economy of San Francisco, you're already wrong - because the money that's causing the rise in rents is coming from outside San Francisco. To have a model that was somewhat accurate, you'd have to also include rents outside of San Francisco also - which aren't rising near as much or as quickly.  And that's really the whole point - the tech boom in the Bay Area is causing people who don't have tech-level salaries to be forced out of San Francisco, because so many people want to live here. There's plenty of cheaper places with more square footage, etc. elsewhere in the rest of the Bay Area - but the most intense rent bidding war is in San Francisco.   And all these people running here is changing the culture and the city for the worse, as artists and establishments that have been here for decades just can't afford the rent increases that tech money can.   I don't really see how these observations are at all controversial."
sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,bayareamota,3,Tue Jul 21 07:19:49 2015 UTC,"You are not looking at the Mission as part of the bigger picture. The most important places we can build new housing are dense, urban areas with good public transit infrastructure. The Mission fits this better than just about any other residential neighborhood in the entire Bay Area. If you eschew your responsibility to build housing in one particular neighborhood, you are claiming your neighborhood is special over another. This is textbook NIMBYism - that you're okay with it just not here in my back yard. Well everyone says that about their neighborhood - that's why we're in the situation we're in."
sanfrancisco,3dz0eo,bmc2,2,Tue Jul 21 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"I am looking at the Mission as part of the bigger picture. You are ignoring the bigger picture - tech money. Somehow you are avoiding the fact that tech money is behind the rise in rents.  Let's talk about responsibility. Who is in trouble here of being forced to move by higher rents? Long-time residents who aren't making huge amounts of money, or new residents who are? Answer please.  Let's talk about results. Why do you think more housing will lower rents - when the money that's coming into the Mission and San Francisco that is raising the rents, is not at all dependent on the economy of San Francisco?  Let's talk about supply and demand. Why do you think that more housing will lower the rents - when, once again, the money that's going into those rents and all the new people who want to live here is not at all dependent on the economy of San Francisco?  You can go ahead and call it NIMBYism if you like - but it doesn't connect. I don't have an objection to new buildings. As I originally stated, I'm for those new buildings if they are specifically targeted to lower incomes.  Basically, if we're sure the lower and middle class have homes, the rich can bid over the rest as much as they want.   Well everyone says that about their neighborhood - that's why we're in the situation we're in.   ^ lol. So it's your contention that SF's current housing shortage and rising rents has nothing to do with tech money. It's only because people don't want new buildings?  Really, does that honestly make sense to you."

sanfrancisco,3dz96x,TheAntiPedantic,10,Mon Jul 20 20:17:20 2015 UTC,"It's a result of the ruling in the Shelley v. Kraemer case by the Supreme court in 1948 that prohibited the refusal of renting based on race. But suburbanization at this point in time was just starting to happen and many formerly white neighborhoods such as the Richmond and Sunset were being depleted of residents and the low costs of these buildings allowed many people emigrating to the US a cheap place to live. I can't say exactly the exact correlation, but the time period is coincident."

The problem is that the rest area is off to the side a bit so I feel like you'd be further away in order to get a straight-on shot like that. Unless you've got a drone or something.

It takes me all of 10 minutes to walk there, about 1 minute to drive.  Our police station is Taraval station, 3 and a half miles away, almost all of which is stop signs every single block. It takes police 45-60 minutes to show up there.  Break-ins and home invasions are getting incredibly commonplace in my neighborhood right now, as seen on all the posts on Nextdoor. From what I understand, there's supposed to be beat cops patrolling our area. Know what? More than half of the cops I speak to who come out here didn't even know that this was part of their territory. All the resources go to patrolling the Sunset.  So what the fuck? How in the world does it make sense to isolate a community from it's incredibly obvious police station, and link it with a station half the damn city away with cops who don't even know the community that they're supposed to be protecting? I genuinely do not understand this, so if anyone can elucidate it, I'd appreciate it, as would the five people on my block who's houses have been broken into over the past three months.

It's mostly terrified housewives and typical SF 311-spammers. Email Taraval's CompStat officer (usually listed on the weekly newsletter) and ask for details about crime trends in your patrol area.  Finally, if you really feel you aren't getting the service you require, you can attend a Police Commission meeting and ask, during public comment, for changes."

At One Kearny, the developer was required to provide roughly 2,500 square feet of space for the public - no easy feat, given that the project consists of a mid-block addition to a modest 1906 bank tower already fused to a 1964 wing.

I'm a motorcyclist/scooter rider in the city, and it's can be harder than you might think to find spots, especially in the residential areas where people block their driveways and spill into the curblets on either side. I've come back to my bike parked well clear of people's driveways with notes on it from homeowners saying I'm still too close because I guess they like to swing wide."

sanfrancisco,3e2xb1,mhallgren5,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:20 2015 UTC,"It's definitely way easier than parking a car and absolutely a perk of a bike! No question. On my particular block in the inner Richmond, it can be a little hairy, that's all. Just about everywhere else in the city it's a breeze, but the residential areas can be tough. And by tough I mean slightly harder than usual for a motorcycle, by which I mean still significantly easier than a car.

I don't really know what the deal is with scoot, is this his bike for a period of time?  Is it more like getaround?  Can someone else pick up this bike and if so why haven't they?  Or why hasn't he moved it when he realized he is completely blocking off a legitimate parking space for a car?  There are dozens of spaces around here (all within a 1-block radius) that accommodate bikes but not cars."
sanfrancisco,3e2xb1,chillvetica,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:59 2015 UTC,"Scoot is more like Getaround or Zipcar, I guess someone else just hasn't rented that bike yet.   When you take Scoot's very brief instructional class (and every time you end your reservation with Scoot) they tell you to try to seek out curblets if you can. They also tell you to :try: not to take a spot that could be occupied by a car and not to block driveways, so I guess this guy is trying to pick as many of those as he can. Oh and you have to park somewhere where you won't get a ticket within 48 hours.   But if you say there are curblets, he should be parked on a curblet."

sanfrancisco,3dwts3,yumdumpster,3,Mon Jul 20 18:59:49 2015 UTC,Just need some good cameras and they don't need to chase them. Just go meet them at home.

I don't mind them trying to pull them over, but it's basically impossible given the numbers and the flexibility a bike gives. There's all kinds of videos on youtube where the cops get involved with a group like this.   In a best case, they could focus on one guy until he ran out of gas, assuming he didn't give them the slip. And even then, catching 1 out of 50 doesn't do much."
sanfrancisco,3dwts3,CivetSeattle,3,Mon Jul 20 20:19:12 2015 UTC,Why don't people call the cops on these guys? They are clearly breaking the law and creating a dangerous environment.
sanfrancisco,3dwts3,joshiness,5,Mon Jul 20 18:12:37 2015 UTC,"Cops won't do shit because of the no chase policy.  Basically, all the guys on bikes have to do is pose a threat to the greater public and the cops can't and won't do jack shit.  It's fucking retarded.  If you ever want to evade the cops in SF, all you have to do is try to ride on the sidewalk, and the cops aren't legally allowed to follow you."
sanfrancisco,3dwts3,NotFromKentucky,3,Mon Jul 20 19:59:53 2015 UTC,"There's a reason for it, with how dense we are as a city, having bikes and cars blowing red lights trying to get away from the cops would be disastrous. Yeah, these guys are being idiots and pose a threat to the public, now imagine them being chased by cops.   I'm not sure what better solution there is to getting these guys, but putting more people in danger is not the solution. Perhaps City cameras identifying individuals that don't have their faces covered? I'm not sure."

Drones out there loaded with Stingray like cellphone tower simulator equipment able to scrape cellphone information.  If the local cops are going to play with their toys, this is exactly the type of scenario they might want to apply them towards. That ever expanding 'terrorism' definition may as well include man-childs terrorizing the roadway."

sanfrancisco,3du7nk,adelie42,8,Sun Jul 19 17:34:30 2015 UTC,"There are lazy, dangerous, and discourteous drivers of bicycles and cars; but the Idaho Stop law is safer for all when properly followed. It is not a slacking of law, it is a critical look at traffic dynamics that appreciates the differences between cars and bicycles in the same way many vehicles must play by slightly different rules that make sense for their situation."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,HBombthrow,10,Sun Jul 19 18:33:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agree.  People forget though that Idaho Stop is still ""Red light equals stop sign,"" i.e. full stop at timed lights."

sanfrancisco,3du7nk,cowinabadplace,17,Sun Jul 19 18:48:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with stop-as-yield, especially since all these people crying themselves hoarse about cyclists doing rolling stops probably don't do proper stops either.   I mean, I've seen maybe a handful of vehicles in total doing full stops (3 s of no movement). Instead, any time I stop fully at a stop sign¹ and I'm trying the bloody balancing thing, or if I clip out and clip back in, someone always takes that as an invitation to quickly go in the perpendicular direction.   The thing is, I don't blame them. A full cyclist stop will take me time to accelerate from if I'm clipping in again, and they can fit in in that time.   ¹ I do this every time because I'm trying to get faster off the block."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,xanados,6,Sun Jul 19 18:19:47 2015 UTC,There is no law that says you have to stop for three seconds. The law only requires you to come to a complete stop.

sanfrancisco,3du7nk,xanados,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:16:39 2015 UTC,"I think that's what they tell you to do in drivers ed as a sort of ""to be really safe"" kind of thing."

sanfrancisco,3du7nk,HBombthrow,4,Mon Jul 20 02:20:34 2015 UTC,"Idaho Stop is still ""Red light equals stop sign,"" so full stop (and give complete right of way) at timed lights when red. It only turns into ""Yield"" at actual ""Stop"" signs."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,scarlotti-the-blue,7,Sun Jul 19 21:16:15 2015 UTC,"That's correct.  So people who blow red lights would still be breaking the law, but stopping and rolling would be fine, which makes sense if no one's coming."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,HBombthrow,2,Sun Jul 19 21:42:56 2015 UTC,"Rolling is not okay at a red light.  I'm just saying that b/c it seems like a lot of cyclists think Idaho Stop would mean a ""rolling"" yield on a red light.  It means that on a stop sign, but on a red light it's still full stop, look, then go, even if nobody's coming. (Edit: except on right turns only)"
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,scarlotti-the-blue,43,Sun Jul 19 22:09:07 2015 UTC,"""stopping and rolling"".  I was using the term ""rolling"" to mean, ""carry on, after stopping"".   But frankly, it doesn't really matter if no one's around.  Yes, it would still be illegal, but saying it's not okay is still matter of interpretation of the circumstances in any practical world :-)"
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,BDB_JCD,24,Mon Jul 20 01:47:08 2015 UTC,Gosh I wish they would come over to my neighborhood and start ticketing the drivers blowing through the 4 way stop all day long in front of my building.  They could fund most city services.
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,yourparadigm,11,Sun Jul 19 16:22:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I think we need a lot more enforcement of the road rules for everyone. I can't believe they don't have cops camping out in intersections giving huge fines for blocking the box downtown for instance (like they do in NYC).

It's real damage.  But in San Francisco traffic now, we can't assume everyone else will stop. Us pedestrians have to anticipate that bikers will blow lights or stop signs, and illegally encroach the crosswalk while we're in it."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,SuckerFreeCity,4,Sun Jul 19 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/scarlotti-the-blue's comment further down that the Idaho Stop (red lights are a hard stop, stop signs are a yield) should be law for cyclists.  I have zero sympathy for cyclists who blow through red lights-- red light violations can and should be enforced.  But as a cyclist, I'd really hate to get cited for running a stop sign when there are no cars around."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,dixieStates,4,Mon Jul 20 02:19:45 2015 UTC,"I couldnt agree more. Cyclists who dont stop at red lights are suicidal. As for stop signs, people who dont ride will have a hard time understanding just how much energy it takes to start from a dead stop. 4 way stops should be a de-facto yield for bikers."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,in_my_underwear,3,Mon Jul 20 05:23:51 2015 UTC,"I am ALL for everyone keeping the flow of traffic moving in every safe way possible.  I am not a cyclist but I don't need to be to know that an Idaho Stop keeps the flow of traffic moving.  As long as you approach  a stop sign at a speed where you COULD stop if you need to (rather than the standard 15mph wiggle approach) and you get to the line before I've come to a stop in my vehicle, it's all yours.  In the same way, if you're a pedestrian and you get to the curb at the same time as a motor vehicle, just fucking let them go.  It will take them half the time to do it and therefore keeping the flow of ALL traffic moving.  This is not an ""I'm in a car I get to go"" mentality because I spend half of my time as a pedestrian waving cars through or walking away from the crosswalk so they'll go when I'm on foot.  This city is fucking CONGESTED, lets all keep it moving safely."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,nohxpolitan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:52 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what the law should be.  The law is that bicyclists must come to a full stop at stop signs.

sanfrancisco,3du7nk,faux_bro,39,Mon Jul 20 06:23:46 2015 UTC,"okay... but this is a discussion thread, and our (the public's) opinion of the law is important.  The article itself quotes the SFBC's opinion of what the law should be too."

I'm not going to put my feet down at a 4-way stop unless there are people who are meant to go before me.

sanfrancisco,3du7nk,faceslam,4,Sun Jul 19 17:08:00 2015 UTC,you are so wrong. i make complete stops to avoid tickets because that shit is expensive. You are the problem and this is why they are cracking down.
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,craigiest,12,Sun Jul 19 17:31:06 2015 UTC,"If a bike comes to an absolute and complete stop at a four-way when they have the right of way, it just makes everyone wait longer. It also risks the driver misinterpreting that the cyclist is yielding and going out of turn, increasing the chance of them hitting the cyclist. There's no excuse for blowing through stop signs, but there's a sane way to safely navigate an intersection without putting your feet on the ground. The law should be changed to reflect this rather than pretending that what makes sense for a one-ton, hundred-horse-power machine makes sense for a bike."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,tonyray,11,Sun Jul 19 17:47:20 2015 UTC,"what you said is not true. Brush up on your driving laws. If i see a cyclist stopped when i get to a 4 way stop, i wait for them to go because thats the law.. you are supposed to yield to the other person. Waiting is not an issue either. This city has tons of pedestrians and i am accustomed to waiting for an old grandma taking her time walking the crosswalk.  You are the reason why this crackdown is happening, you have a weird way of thinking about 4 way stops. The law is the law and you dont like it, change it. Until then you should follow the law like everyone else."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,SnapMokies,6,Sun Jul 19 17:51:28 2015 UTC,"People in this city have no idea how right of way works. Drivers violate that part of the law constantly. The safest way I've found to interact with cars is to greatly slow but not completely stop when I have the right of way so the car doesn't take off into me, or to completely stop when they have the right of way and insist on them going first, even though they usually try to wave me through. Motion is a gesture that communicates your intentions. Taking that away in the name of laws designed for automobiles does not increase safety."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,chewp911,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this scenario where you have the right of way, never stop, and are worried about getting t boned.  You get the right of way when you stop.  If someone is already stopped when you stop, they have the right of way.  If you're stopped and someone else gets to the intersection, they will wait for you and you won't get t boned.  If you never stop, you're right of way is never triggered."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,Paradox,9,Sun Jul 19 19:04:50 2015 UTC,"What he's talking about isn't how bikers get t boned. He's saying that if they roll the intersection at low speed after verifying they have right of way and it's clear it isn't a safety concern, which is true.   The problem is bikers ignoring signs/lights and blowing the intersection at speed."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,Rudacris,12,Sun Jul 19 20:16:57 2015 UTC,Wrong. It's called an Idaho stop and is not unsafe. Do some research before climbing up on your high horse.

sanfrancisco,3du7nk,DesktopStruggle,11,Sun Jul 19 19:00:53 2015 UTC,California stop is when you do it in your car. Idaho actually has a law passed about it.

sanfrancisco,3du7nk,DesktopStruggle,3,Sun Jul 19 18:15:00 2015 UTC,"(like every single car does, none of you stop either)   What are you talking about?  Cars running stop signs are the exception.  Most cars stop at all stop signs, though some will just do a rolling stop.  I stop even when traffic doesn't require me to because I want to avoid tickets.  Bicyclists rarely stop because they know they probably won't get a ticket."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,Zharol,7,Sun Jul 19 17:23:32 2015 UTC,"Most cars stop at all stop signs   If you applied a rigid standard -- full stop behind the limit line, yield right-of-way to pedestrians, and so on -- you'd realize your statement is untrue.  I just walked over to my living room window and looked at my nearest sleepy residential neighborhood intersection to collect a little data. As expected, only one out of five cars lawfully stopped at the stop sign.  And rather than the pouting over unfairness that constitutes most of the driver comments in these threads, this is actually dangerous. Rather than asserting their right of way, pedestrians are giving way to cars to avoid being hit and injured or killed. All because drivers don't think safety laws are important enough to apply to them.   That's where the true safety problem is -- with drivers."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,Zharol,3,Sun Jul 19 17:46:48 2015 UTC,"I wasn't applying a rigid standard.  I know that a lawful stop is for a full three seconds, and that most people don't do that every time.  I was referring to the kind of stop that most people would consider reasonable when not impeded by traffic.  I also don't expect bicyclists to make a full, lawful stop every time either.  I just don't like seeing them blow through intersections without even slowing down or yielding right-of-way.  My initial comment was only meant as a reply to the comment equating how cars behave at stop with how bicyclists behave. Regardless of the issue of safety, it's pretty obvious that bicyclists are worse than cars when it comes to following the rules of the road."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,DesktopStruggle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:58:54 2015 UTC,"And I disagree. Cars are by orders of magnitude more dangerous. (And statistics bear that out.)  Also, by rigid standard I meant a safety standard. The three seconds has nothing to do with it. The four out of five cars I saw were being unsafe (only one of them stopped at all). That fits my experience out on San Francisco streets as a pedestrian."

So what to them is a reasonable stop, is quite often a dangerous one to pedestrians."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,baklazhan,3,Sun Jul 19 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on this, but as for your other point I guess we've just had different experiences.  I've lived in SF for over 20 years and have been without a car for many of those years.  In my experience as a pedestrian and as a car driver, I've almost been hit by reckless bicyclists more times than by cars.  When you consider how many more cars I encounter on a typical day than bikes, that is even more significant.  Obviously getting hit by a car is worse than being hit by a bike, but that's not what my point was about.   Edit:  I've also been a bicyclist in SF.  For a couple of years I rode a bike to work every day through downtown, so I do know what it's like for bicyclists and I'm not prejudiced against them."

sanfrancisco,3du7nk,faux_bro,4,Mon Jul 20 00:58:23 2015 UTC,"Just for fun, I stuck my head out the window and watched the nearest intersection, which has a stop sign. 9 cars. 2 stopped fully (there was cross traffic). One squealed to a stop for unknown reasons (maybe someone on the opposite side of the intersection which I can't see). Six rolled through it at various speeds."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,stouset,2,Mon Jul 20 00:31:37 2015 UTC,This exact thinking is why so many drivers are frustrated with cyclists
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,sfthrow87,0,Sun Jul 19 19:18:12 2015 UTC,Well then I see no reason for cars to stop either if they are so certain that an intersection is clear.

If we think the roads are unsafe for cars and pedestrians, then adding large numbers of cyclists adds to the danger. The arrogant habits of both drivers and cyclists is what needs to be addressed.

This was footage from my dash cam that I recorded at one of the last intersection on the wiggle - northbound Scott and westbound Fell.  Notice that the 1st the cyclist wasn't even considering stopping until he saw me turning left onto Scott from Fell, and another cyclist cut across early into a driveway and onto the sidewalk.  I see this happening all the time, especially during the evening commute home.  They're cutting off vehicular access southbound to Scott at Fell at some point which will eliminate this issue, which will some headache for those of us who live on Scott between Fell and Oak, but overall will be a good change for both cyclists and motorists.  Pedestrians, on the other hand, sometimes don't realize that there's a protected left northbound, and will start crossing the street before it's their turn..."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,Leachmere2020,8,Sun Jul 19 18:27:32 2015 UTC,I bike that route everyday and you're absolutely correct.  Cyclists are idiots at that intersection.  What people aren't aware of is that the lights are timed in such a way that you can barely get to divis just as the light turns red.  So the people who actually wait for the turn signal end up catching up to them anyway.  Completely unnecessary.
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,OverlyPersonal,2,Sun Jul 19 19:53:23 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how you reach that conclusion. If you wait for the green light, and go, you'll ""barely get to divis just as the light turns red"". This is obvious, because the lights are timed for drivers on Fell. First, the lights on Scott and Fell switch to red on Fell and green on Scott-- stopping traffic on Fell and allowing cyclists to go. Then, ~eight seconds later, as cyclists are approaching Divis, the lights change to stop traffic on Fell and allow Divis to go."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,baklazhan,5,Mon Jul 20 00:49:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a known hazard which, as you say will indeed be fixed when they eliminate the left turn there.  I usually defend bikers but that's a stupid move."

Like it or not, we've gone to great lengths to encourage everyone to own and use a car. This discussion is about some bicyclists who are breaking the law by not coming to a complete stop every few hundred feet as they travel across town. A few blocks up from the Wiggle, you have Fell and Oak, (re)designed for cars to drive across town at 30 mph without stopping. And with more fatalities than on the wiggle, to boot.

Putting a barrier to entry in front of cycling is a net loss for communities. What we really need to do is make cycling proficiency part of the education system. At around 10 or 11 years old, you should be taught how to ride your bike safely on public roads as part of your school year."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,faux_bro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:10:38 2015 UTC,"This is something a lot of local law enforcement already does because schools don't have anywhere near the resources needed. There are bike fairs and expos that have been put on multiple times a year in every town/city I have lived in where they teach all the rules, have demo areas, and organize group rides to help kids/adults get more comfortable riding in traffic. The issue is only a section of parents bring their kids so they can learn and those kids eventually start riding and doing what they will and we end up in situations like these."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,OverlyPersonal,2,Sun Jul 19 19:02:00 2015 UTC,"What we need is more awareness of the rules of the road on the part of drivers, and an understanding that the road does not belong to them. It is beyond shocking the number of drivers who don't know that they can't park in a bike lane, who don't know how to make a legal right turn and who don't know that they need to pass cyclists with a minimum of 3 feet. Coming from Switzerland, I find biking here to be far more stressful not because cyclists don't know how to ride but because drivers are ignorant and entitled."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,stouset,4,Mon Jul 20 19:16:07 2015 UTC,"That's a wonderful and idealistic idea. Given that our school systems do not have the funding to provide bikes to kids to learn to ride on-- let alone the significant levels of liability that schools would take on by providing them (i can just imagine the lawsuits when a malfunction happens and injury is caused). But I do love the idea of teaching kids this in school. The reality is that won't happen any time soon, and we still have an existing problem of cyclists that either don't care about the laws, or are ignorant to them.  Edit: I think it's important to point out that many of the laws in this case are not about arbitrary tax collection, but are deeply rooted in reciprocal safety."

If a cyclist's (or driver's) poor judgment gets themselves killed, no law is going to stop that. The difference is that cyclist's bad decisions don't tend to risk others' lives (as borne out by the statistics), while drivers' do. That is the type of behavior we should care about.   Cyclists have been responsible for two fatalities since 1995. Automobiles are responsible for more than twenty per year. Given that we have limited enforcement power, do you truly believe we should be spending it on reducing the already-minuscule cycling side, or the hundredfold larger automobile side?"

In 2014, 18 pedestrians were killed and three bicyclists died, according to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency.  While deaths were down slightly compared with 2013,  Schneider says the number can vary drastically from year to year. One way to better measure safety progress on the streets, she said, is to also consider the number of severe injury collisions.  City transportation planners studied more than 2,000 collisions involving pedestrians in recent years and found that 60 percent of severe injuries and deaths occur on just 6 percent of streets, mostly in the Tenderloin, South of Market and North Beach.  Many of those streets are dangerous by design, say advocates, and encourage speed and bad driving behavior. That’s why city officials have eyed those streets for near and long-term improvements under Vision Zero.   Source"

When calling 911 ""I just saw someone get run over"" ""Is that person a cyclist?"" ""Yes"" ""If they are hurt call back /clickendcall""  The police department does not care one iota about cyclist.   Their belief (which is somewhat true) is that the public pressure and tax base comes from car owners.   As we continue on though the tax base is shifting where only 30% of citizens in some neighborhoods own cars, and the financial demographics cannot be explained anymore by cars vs. carless.

I've received stop sign citations from SFPD and when I went in for my trial, the judge took one look at it and said ""this is ridiculous"" and immediately dismissed my fine. I see this crack down as nothing more than a money making scheme. To truly eliminate pedestrian deaths you would need to ban cars all together, however, I don't see that happening for the foreseeable future. A bicycle and car are two different things and should not be subject to the same traffic laws. For instance, its safer for me to hop a red light once the intersection is clear to get ahead of the cars behind me, rather than taking off at the same time and risk getting clipped by someone."

For this reason, most people don't notice the sheer ubiquity drivers breaking the rules of the road. When cyclists do it, it stands out because it isn't normative. They say the kind of thing you do because the default is that drivers are in fact entitled to the road and to breaking the rules. Most don't care to learn the rules and many harass cyclists for legal behavior like taking the lane. I'm all for cyclists stopping at red lights and stop signs, but their behavior is all in all less dangerous, less illegal and less entitled."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,stouset,3,Mon Jul 20 19:23:29 2015 UTC,"No - the big difference is cars are killing people by the thousands every day, but we attack cyclists for breaking the same rules and divert efforts into enforcement that does little to protect the people. Incidentally, you've lumped all bicyclists together, a classic faulty generalization used by anti-bike, prejudiced types such as yourself."

Maybe go pop a few sea lions in the head, because no one will be harmed by that.  Besides, we all know a bicyclist could never kill someone could they? I mean,it simply couldnt happen. SO no need to enforce any laws against those special snowflake bicyclists...  http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2013/08/15/107079/Chris-Bucchere-Sutchi-Hui-bicyclist-pedestrian  And bikers wonder why the rest of the world fucking hates them.

I for one always stop at red lights, but when it comes to stop signs I only really come to a full stop when someone else is stopped and has the right away. All other times I treat it as yield. Funny story though, I was flying up Polk about to go up the hill gaining speed and a jay walker pops out from behind a car parked at the side of the intersection. I ended up hitting him but we were both okay. Made me more cautious on intersections all together."

Can't even tell you the number of times I've seen a MUNI bus blow thru a red, and then stop blocking the whole bike lane in the intersection.  Unfortunately pretty much everyone stops in the bike lane, because practically speaking doing anything else is a huge pain.

sanfrancisco,3du7nk,beatboxrevival,0,Mon Jul 20 19:26:18 2015 UTC,"Most uber drivers do this illegal, and it forces cyclists to unsafely pass on the left. There are ways around this, like having the app disallow any bike lane to be a pick up zone. I'm not sure why this isn't happening already."
sanfrancisco,3du7nk,dilap,2,Sun Jul 19 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"So what do you suggest we do? Circle the block until we orbit around the pick up location so our passengers can do a running jump into the back seat?   If taxi cabs are allowed to do it, so should ubers we provide just as vital of a service as taxi cabs. In fact we provide the same service and then some.

Uber doesn't pay those fees. So no, they shouldn't get the same benefits. You should park in a space that's legal and doesn't impede other commuters.   I'm sure city would love to know that uber drivers are using the bike lanes illegally, with full knowledge and understanding that what they're doing is illegal."

A jaded mind will dismiss the occurrences of past decades as long-since dead, but I would argue that there was a force at work back then that created measurable change, and that it will not die. And through my mind-bending nights with friends piled in the back of my green Honda civic, I raced alongside Thompson through the same roadways, the same routes, finding mischief and laughter at every turn.

I really only got a few thousand more than I was expecting. had to spend about 10k for staging, painting, polishing and cleaning. No foreign buyers or all cash offers. Financing can be tricky in certain buildings and HOA rules such as pet policies can get in the way of an offer. It wasn't the slam dunk I expected. First buyer pulled out right before signing, that added time and stress. Overall 10/10, would sell again."

sanfrancisco,3dpyp6,johnw188,2,Tue Jul 21 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"Seems right to me for a small condo. Don't skimp on that, 20k in staging can get you 100k more than you would have otherwise."

sanfrancisco,3dpyp6,johnw188,3,Sat Jul 18 19:15:51 2015 UTC,"20k is more for a single family home, but think about it. You're going to repaint the whole house, probably refinish some floors, and hire an interior designer who specializes in staging to figure out what furniture/art/whatever would make your house most attractive to buyers. You're then going to rent all of that stuff, hire movers to move it in, storage to store all of your stuff while you're waiting for the sale to go through to buy a new house, movers to move the stuff out afterwards, and probably a host of other little details."
sanfrancisco,3dpyp6,VROF,3,Sat Jul 18 19:47:18 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the people buying the house want to choose the color and floor finish? I guess I just assumed the market was so good that stuff is unnecessary.

sanfrancisco,3dpyp6,sshue55,3,Sun Jul 19 20:29:34 2015 UTC,"Real estate agent here. I'm not an owner but I can help answer this question to shed some light on this issue.   *How much over asking did you get? (A percentage is fine)    This is a funny question because it totally depends on what the agent/owner prices it at.  Ex: if a house is worth 950k (we know this because we look at similar comparables that sold in that specific district), we can choose to price at 949k, 899k, 849k and even 799k.  If the place sells for 1m, how much over asking would that be? Well, depends on how low the listing price was. With that being said, the lower you go, the better the results in this market. It's actually bad if you price at what is worth because people think it's going to go way above and be scared off. If it's worth 950k and you price at 950k, people will think it will sell for 1.2 and not bother to put an offer. This just happened to my listing!   *How many foreign offers did you get?    My listing received 6 offers and none were foreign buyers. Only one was all cash and it was the lowest of all the offers. I think it was just an investor from the states.   *Did you take a lower offer because you preferred to sell to one person over another and why?    Normally in this market if my client likes an offer but it's not the highest, I will recommend countering the offer you like to match the price of the highest. Say the highest offer is an investor and just wants to rent it out but the second is a young family just starting off.  The seller might feel for the family and give them a chance to bring their offer up.    Do you know the current state of your old building? Was it torn down? More space added?     This was a 2012 condo so it will remain there for a while. Most places that are purchased are rarely torn down. Most common is just an updating of kitchen and bathroom. If there is room for expansion, it would mostly happen in the basement adding another room and bath.   Hope this helped! Keep the questions coming!   Thanks."

You didn't mention whether you can budget 2.5k just for mortgage or if that is your budget for total cost of ownership (taxes, maintenance, HOA, etc) but lets assume 2.5 K towards just mortgage.  With 15k cash available you'll come close to paying your closing costs and be looking at financing 100 percent or damn close to it.  So you will need to pay PMI, or take a 80% primary mortgage and a second to cover the rest.  So what I'm trying to say nicely is: Your interest rate is going to suck.  You're looking at being able to afford something in the range of 350k to 400k.  So living in SF proper is probably not going to happen, but I think there are decent areas, close to BART, where you could make that work and then have easy access to SF."

sanfrancisco,3dpyp6,instant_michael,2,Sat Jul 18 16:43:39 2015 UTC,"I sold a TIC unit in the mission approx 2 years ago.   Sold at approximately 10% over asking to a couple pregnant with their first child.    Received an offer within a few days, with only a financing (i.e., not all cash) and inspection contingency.  No foreign offers.   A higher offer (by about 5%) came in after I  had accepted the first offer. I went with the lower offer, but told them I wouldn't accept any reduction in the offer based on inspection results.   I had listed my unit as a pocket listing (not officially on MLS). I need to sell in a hurry, so I didn't want to wait to repaint, make minor fixes, stage the place. The rush was because I had bought a duplex in SF, and didn't like the idea of having my life savings tied up in an one type of asset.  That meant that not all offers arrived at the same time, and probably caused me not to get the highest possible price - but still an incredible return for me personally (39% more than I had paid 3 years prior)."

The other offer was someone who worked for Google. He preferred to sell it to someone who likes the home for what it is and not as a project.  See last response.  Condo is still as is and nothing has changed. My friend renovated it before he sold it though.    Edit: The people he sold to were a retired couple from Berkeley. They paid cash for it."
sanfrancisco,3dpyp6,conductive,3,Sun Jul 19 00:50:51 2015 UTC,I bought a home (that I currently live in) a couple of months ago in the Richmond.    Ended up paying 12% over asking.  No contingencies.  20 day close.  There were two other offers in the end of the day.  I'm told there were a couple of preemptive offers as well but the seller refused to look at them.
sanfrancisco,3dpyp6,blincan,2,Mon Jul 20 07:18:48 2015 UTC,"OP:  It doesn't matter how much over asking a place goes for because there is no control on the asking price.  In fact, asking prices are routinely set low in order to generate more interest."

My assumption is that the Chinese buyers are looking in twin peaks, nob hill, Pac heights or the higher price areas? Anyone validate these assumptions??"
sanfrancisco,3dpyp6,adagencies,3,Sat Jul 18 18:50:17 2015 UTC,"There are three types of Chinese buyers that I have encountered. Will add more if can think of any others.   Chinese buyers purchasing in San Francisco for the sake of ""swag"" or living in excess. These are the buyers interested in the huge condo towers with views of the Bay bridge, ocean, and to be in the top floors of new buildings.  They prefer brand new construction.  Purchasing for education. Now this can vary depending on how old their children are. I had a client purchase for their 19 year old daughter at 1.22m that went to usf. I believe there are a lot of international students accepted there since it is a private school (can neither confirm or deny).  So areas around USF is potentially a factor when they are looking for housing for their children when they go to college.  They will also follow what previous friend have dinner too so if a friend purchased in Millbrae because they heard the high school is good out there, they will follow suit and be interested in purchasing further south. Lastly, these Chinese buyers want to live in a familiar community. Walking distance to shopping and restaurants. Sunset and Richmond fulfill those needs.     Overall, I don't see too much purchasing in the middle of San Fransisco such as diamond heights or twin peaks.  Not interested in bayview either."

I know the last one was in Hong Kong and I don't know where the other one was.   They knew how to get every penny out of a rental.  The property management was Chinese, the maintenance and all the contractors I ever saw were clearly illegal chinese (show up before dawn, come through the garage and keep the door closed all day, get rid of any debris after dark), and they even operated their own wholesale hardware store.  I got close enough with one of our maintenance guys that he told me quite a bit about it.  There's at least one warehouse store that only the Chinese can shop at and they can get a toilet, for example, for about a third of what you'd pay.  It's somewhere down in the Bayview."

Obviously that could have a huge affect on Uber, but remember there are other business model issues here.  Catching a Taxi is a very on-demand activity. Nobody buys a regular subscription to a specific driver.  House cleaning is different. Lots of people are looking for regular house cleaning. If you used Homejoy to find someone you liked, you can just set up a side-deal with that cleaner. At that point, neither the worker or customer have any incentive to use Homejoy. That customer never uses Homejoy again.  Of course there is some demand for one-off cleaning, like before/after a party. But is that enough?"

Of course they do - even a simple google search turns up Homejoy subcontractors complaining about it.   Great. Non-competes are not enforceable in many states - including California, where I live and where Homejoy's HQ is located.   Then what does that clause mean? It means they have a strong legal basis to sue you if you poach their customers. How much can they sue you for? For their damages, of course.    I haven't read the non-compete, but I don't have to, because they aren't enforceable where I live, and also in many, many places.   OK, so Homejoy can sue its subcontractors for damages if they poach one of their customers.   ....sigh. You're not a lawyer. Stahp.   Now what were you saying again?

The people they were firing were already off-platform for that business. It's conceptually pretty messed up that if you use homejoy to schedule a cleaning on Tuesday, that they would get to control who you contract to clean homes for on Friday. Homejoy doesn't automatically deserve to be a permanent middleman skimming a cut of all future transactions once the initial introduction is made. Homejoy gets a cut of the actual cleaning they were responsible for arranging."
sanfrancisco,3dntk7,GailaMonster,4,Fri Jul 17 23:27:49 2015 UTC,"EDIT: As someone pointed out below, Homejoy didn't classify their cleaners as employees, so the notion of a non-compete doing anything is even more tenuous. The punishment for violating homejoy's terms and conditions about contracting outside of the platform is that you get your account on the platform deactivated. Big Whoop.  Non-competes are not enforceable in California, and non-competes attempting to restrict the work of non-exec level employees, who do not possess IP knowledge or trade secrets of a business, are unenforceable in many, many places.  This is the risk when your business model is to be a middleman in between two contracting parties. If you do not provide a value justifying your presence, you get cut out of the deal.  Besides, you're going about this wrong. Homejoy doesn't ""own"" the identity of the cleaners. It merely had brokerage influence over the actual transactions that people entered into on the platform. If you use a realtor to find a person selling homes and buy one, you owe that realtor his/her cut/broker's fees (becasue they did the leg work to connect you with the person for THAT sale). you are under no obligation to use that realtor going forward, if you want to talk to that person about their other homes, you don't owe the broker anything else.   I think Homejoy failed because, unlike Uber replacing cabs (which were perennially shitty and not ""competing"" to do a better job,  the system Homejoy sought to replace wasn't seriously broken. Recommendations and Craigslist (and yelp) provided many ways for people to try cleaners, and there are lots of quality cleaners out there you can loyally use while ignoring the low quality services."

If the gig worker isn't an employee, they have no loyalty to the company. If Homejoy says it's not a home cleaning company (as they do on their website), it's an ""introduction"" company. Like OkCupid. I don't have to pay okc to keep dating someone I meet on there, and neither does the customer or gig worker have to use the app to set up a business deal independent of the company."

Ideally, with the hard work whoever cleans your house does, he/she earns decent pay and can afford to have a life with some balance too.  Realistically, though, his/her life is probably really tough.  e.g. an example of the family situation at home (in reply to u/ImFeklr also): http://www.npr.org/2014/11/18/364062673/new-york-city-teen-balances-school-and-life-in-poverty  There is also another great article that I can't find right now, also from the perspective of a child of a maid or nanny, and it shares how his/her mom coming home tired and frustrated (by the client family's kids and housework) meant his/her quality time to be a child and raised by a parent was non-existent.

These are traits that not everyone has and she is thus compensated according to availability of those that can successfully accomplish that job. A lot of sales skills can simply not be taught, and I think there are many people that would have an easier time going to an engineering bootcamp.

sanfrancisco,3dntk7,orageslointains,3,Sat Jul 18 00:00:38 2015 UTC,"Bottom line is this was a bad business. They grossly underpaid their staff, and as a result had horrible untrained staff. I witnessed two Homejoy cleanings, and both were garbage. ITT are a ton of people who will qualify that they consistently don't do a good job. Sometimes they do, most of the time they don't. Shitty house cleaning is not an in-demand commodity."
sanfrancisco,3dntk7,Mister_Squishy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:50:03 2015 UTC,"In essense, they sought to ""solve a problem"" and they failed. Their involvement in a given homecleaning transaction did not improve the experince of either the person cleaning (shit pay) or the person buying the cleaning (varying quality, cancellations, theft).   Homejoy didn't provide any value. Good riddance."
sanfrancisco,3dntk7,GailaMonster,3,Fri Jul 17 22:59:46 2015 UTC,"I think the ""worker lawsuits"" is a red herring. Homejoy wanted to make money connecting gig workers/customers. Once they were connected, why would either person continue to use the app? If I found a cleaner I liked, I would just arrange my cleanings with that individual outside the app. The ""independent contractor"" has no loyalty to homejoy, since they are not receiving any benefits of being an employee and the app is not essential to them providing the service (Unlike Uber).   Additionally, professional home cleaning is not something that pretty much anyone can do (like being a driver). It is a finely honed skill and it's hard to find a good cleaner. Promising good cleaners without actually having a system in place to vet and deliver skilled cleaners was a lazy mistake.   It's also risky to invite someone into your home and trust them with your property and personal items. The specious background checks that homejoy promised didn't go far enough, and neither did a vague mention of insurance (after saying they are not a home cleaning company). I'm also nervous about Uber/Lyft drivers - I'm basically getting into a stranger's car! But I'm only in there for 10 min in a big busy city vs inviting someone into my home.   My roommate got us a homejoy person once.. it was not awful, but I wouldn't have used the service again. She basically wiped down the kitchen counter, vacuumed, and dusted a bit and somehow took 2 hours to do this (takes me about 30 min). Then they wanted extra time/hours to clean the bathroom. It definitely wasn't sparkling clean, and I could do a better job myself. Whoever this person was obviously had no professional cleaning experience or skill. Connecting me to her through an app, convenient as it was, ended up being pretty much useless."
sanfrancisco,3dntk7,zeusfaber,2,Fri Jul 17 23:11:25 2015 UTC,"Here's a question: Why would homejoy even deserve an ongoing cut, if the value of what they provided was the initial introduction?   These middleman apps are brokers. Brokers get paid for the initial introduction and sale. Then they go the fuck away. If you like that person the broker introduced you to, and want to work with that person on a future project/transaction, the broker doesn't OWN you or that other person; the broker has also already been paid for the introduction."
sanfrancisco,3dntk7,GailaMonster,2,Fri Jul 17 23:54:11 2015 UTC,"Agree with you - they don't deserve a cut, and they were swiftly informed of this.   All of these apps share this quality - they want to use the workers and their resources and take a cut, without taking responsibility for the workers or the service provided. ""We are a tech company"" - not a transportation company, home cleaning company, shipping company, etc. Workers are ""independent contractors"" and use their own personal tangibles to do the job - cars, cleaning supplies, cell phone, etc.   Sounds like a plan, right? Low overhead, no real training for workers or quality control, no cost for tangibles such as vehicles, cleaning supplies, and space to store them. That's all on the worker bee. At some point you become hands-off enough to become just that - a broker. Then you're not going to be necessary in the long run."

sanfrancisco,3dntk7,HebrewHamm3r,2,Sat Jul 18 02:57:22 2015 UTC,"This contractor vs. employee thing is sure claiming a lot of collateral damage.   It used to be clear: if you don't control when to work, and where to work, you need training to do a job, and equipment is provided, it's obviously a JOB, not contract work.   OTOH, if you can refuse a job, you schedule your own job, you don't need ""training"", and you provide your own equipment, then it's clearly contracting work.   By this definition, both Uber and Homejoy are pretty obviously contracting work. You decide when and where to work (i.e. you can choose which job to take, log out if you don't want to work), you don't need training, and you provide your own equipment.   So WTF happened with the court decision? I have no f***ing idea.   Frankly, there's NO WAY Uber will pay benefits without MASSIVELY increasing current rates and/or reducing payout to drivers. Their ENTIRE business model relies on them hiring contractors.   The only comparable case would be Veolia / Supershuttle, and those guys are cheating the system by forcing the drivers to buy out their vans and suddenly become ""contractors"" to the company."

Most of Winnipeg is accessible from just driving within the city and the cities around us are all farms so most don't venture out. We have really hot summers so it kind of makes up for it.

Did you know, there are an estimated 250,000 Canadians in Northern California?  UC Berkeley has had a Canadian Studies program since 1982. Here's our facebook and twitter (pardon our website that looks like it's from 1982.... we're launching a new one in a few weeks).    Another fantastic group is the The Digital Moose Lounge. A social and professional group that serves as a first point of contact for new Canadians in the Bay Area, helps people get connected and settled, and hosts a bunch of events each year. You just missed their annual Bay Area Canada Picnic. DML is open to all Canadians and Friends of Canada in Silicon Valley / the Bay Area. (DML's website is also being redone and will be modernized in a few months...)  Because Silicon Valley attracts the best and brightest tech workers from around the world, there is a particularly large contingent of Canadians in the Valley.   The Consulate General of Canada in San Francisco represents Canada officially in the Bay Area. Cassie Doyle is Consul General.   The Canadian Women's Club (CWC) of the San Francisco Bay Area is a longstanding philanthropic and social group of Canadian women who do a lot of great things in the community. There's also a Canadian Women's Club 2.0 for younger women.   Welcome to /r/SanFrancisco!

You're going much slower and have much better visibility than you would in a car (higher up, further forward and with no wide A-pillar to block your view). If you see a cyclist who doesn't slow at all or doesn't stop to appropriately yield to other cars, etc. he's obviously being unsafe and there are a lot of people like that, but just rolling a stop when you can see nobody's coming shouldn't be a problem for bikes and is even explicitly legal in some places."

It seems like bicyclists can be a little arrogant when it comes to defending the actions of other bicyclists. I don't think you will find many car drivers who think that all car drivers are angels and that cars aren't dangerous. I think that there needs to be an attitude adjustment in the bicyclist community as it becomes more ""mainstream."" Utilizing a bicycle does not make you different in any way with regard to your responsibility to not be an asshole. If you need examples of the defensiveness of the bicycle community look at the vehement denial and response of advocates in this thread. It seems like the bicycle coalition is not willing to give any ground (as a reading of the article shows and others in this thread have mentioned). In my opinion the bicycle coalition hurts its stated goals of advocating for bicyclists by going too far in this regard.

And because they are drivers who think the roads are for cars, they constantly look out for cars and give way without even noticing all the laws being broken. Bicyclists on the other hand, probably aren't part of what they expect. So everything wrong (or perceived to be wrong) that a bicyclist does is unexpected and scary.  That's my best guess anyway. Since bicyclists don't even come close to presenting the danger that drivers do, the explanation has got to be something like that."

As a pedestrian I am not threatened by cars or bicycles because I've always taken care to be extremely aware of my surroundings. That doesn't stop me from being annoyed when a cyclist doesn't give right of way or violates some other law. A scofflaw does not have to directly impact you for it to cause you to feel annoyance. I could be walking and see a car blow a red light, a car double parked, and a cyclist blow a red and be annoyed at all three.   I've seen cars fail to yield to pedestrians and nothing would make me happier than to see that driver cited, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't want to see a cyclist cited for a similar offense, or a pedestrian for jumping out in the street while on their phone with cars coming.  We live in a society where there are a lot of collective action problems that don't have to directly threaten you or impact you for you to care about them. Quality of life for everyone is improved when drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians have a little due regard and common sense.  Also in answer to your question, there are plenty of elderly, frail, or otherwise unable to move quickly pedestrians who are afraid of cyclists because they are less able to control for assholes. These people are terrified of vehicles for the same reason and of course there is a much greater threat from the vehicle, yet that does not alleviate their fear of the cyclist just because statistically they would only be somewhat injured and not dead."

There are people who are not primarily drivers, who walk (or ride a bike) as their primary means of transportation, while driving only occasionally -- and frankly look at the world from a different perspective.   Part of viewing the world from a different perspective is recognizing how terrifyingly dangerous drivers are. You're just not noticing what drivers do, probably because it's normal to you (and you likely drive that way yourself).   Every street, every intersection, even almost every sidewalk has a driver doing something that impinges on pedestrian safety, with pedestrians deferentially giving way out of self-protection. That's our normal, but it's not the way it should be.  Not expecting you to believe (or even understand) this. But that's the alternate perspective that you're having so much trouble seeing."

For the record, I've easily driven over 100k miles and never had so much as a scrape on any of my cars.   Clearly, you're the one who's showing his lack of perspective here.    Every street, every intersection, even almost every sidewalk has a driver doing something that impinges on pedestrian safety, with pedestrians deferentially giving way out of self-protection. That's our normal, but it's not the way it should be.   Of course there are bad drivers here, especially in California. But it's often due to lack of good driving skills than flagrant disregard for the law.   Have you seen people drive in other countries? It's so much worse (except for Germany). People barely obey traffic laws. Due to enforcement here, it's a lot better. Hopefully with some more bike enforcement, we'll have safer bikers, as well."
sanfrancisco,3dngzc,sfthrow87,3,Sat Jul 18 22:48:59 2015 UTC,"Why can't they just crank up the fines on people making egregiously dangerous behavior in order to fund broader enforcement across the board? If you run a red light at 20 over the limit, or hit someone with your car/bike, or drive on the sidewalk (seen it happen), or blow through a stop sign without stopping you should get blasted in the ass with a huge fine. Add some hardship exemptions to stop from bankrupting lower income families and make it on a sliding scale upwards. All you need is one whale to get ticketed and you're good to go.

sanfrancisco,3dngzc,Velonoch,7,Sat Jul 18 05:45:15 2015 UTC,"Hopefully I can preempt the debate a little right now:  The natural way for bicyclists to navigate an intersection is to slow down,  check for danger or others' right of way,  and then proceed.   Bicyclists have been responsible for only two deaths in SF since 1990.  There is an implicit understanding between enforcement and cyclists that if the cyclists screws something up,  they are going to really hurt themselves.   Enforcement will never change behavior.   It will maybe make cyclists look for cops more at certain intersections,  but a bicyclist coming to a complete stop at an intersection is the equivalent requiring a driver to shut off their engine at each stop sign.     Enforcement of this will never ever lead to compliance,  so why waste the resources on behavior that does not result in injuries anyways? We need better laws,  like the Idaho stop rule that permits rolling through stops but enacts harsh penalties for right of way violations."

sanfrancisco,3dngzc,Eclipsed830,6,Fri Jul 17 19:58:06 2015 UTC,why should each type of vehicle have separate laws when operating on the same road?   Several states do have motorcycle / bicycle specific laws that allow them to run reds if they aren't triggering the sensor at the light.  Do you think these laws should be removed so that all vehicles have the same laws on each road?  I think basic physics should be consulted for examples like this.
sanfrancisco,3dngzc,cantquitreddit,3,Fri Jul 17 21:39:27 2015 UTC,"So should motorcyclist be allowed to roll stop signs and red lights too?   I think the Idaho stop law is a good idea but I'm not sure the answer. Considering some of the justifications for the law:   People on bikes have an unobstructed view of the road with no blind spots. Motorcyclists have this too.  People on bikes have stereoscopic hearing. Depending on how loud the engine is this may or may not be the case for the motorcyclist. People on bikes aren't moving very fast, making it easy for them to yield the right of way at a stop sign without coming to a complete stop. On this one motorcycles clearly lose. Most motorcycles are capable of traveling much faster than a bicycle.  The law simply codifies actual riding behavior. It's annoying for a person on a bike to come to a complete stop at an empty intersection and then expend the effort to get going again, so most simply roll through anyway. I don't think the same could be said for motorcyclists, though. It's essentially effortless for a motorcyclist to stop and start at an intersection, requiring little more than a twist of the wrist.  The law makes riding a bicycle easier, thus encouraging an activity with many positive externalities. I think this is true for motorcycles, to an extent. They're more efficient than cars, for sure, but I think many people would bristle at the idea of encouraging a lot more of them on city streets as many tend to be much louder than a typical car.    So after considering the reasons for the Idaho stop law, I have concluded that no, it should not apply to someone on a typical full-sized motorcycle. I'm not really sure about smaller scooters and the rapidly proliferating flavors of ""e-bikes."""
sanfrancisco,3dngzc,unpickle,3,Fri Jul 17 21:06:31 2015 UTC,"Well I'd disagree with you completely as someone who rides both bikes and motorcycles on a lot of your points. 1. We agree on   A lot of the cyclist I see wear headphones while they ride otherwise I'll give that one to the bike. People on bikes can still go 40mph and many do... especially those blowing through red lights/stop signs going downhill. I see it all the time in my neighborhood (Potrero) and in the Mission especially on 16th street coming from Bryant towards Mission. I'm sure this happens everywhere in the city. Its also annoying for a motorcyclists and stopping on a motorcycle is much more work then stopping on a bike. Its more then just a twist of the throttle. When I stop on my bike I can balance for probably a good 30 seconds or so without falling over or having my feet touch the ground. Its easy to stop and wait when you have just 22lbs between your legs. On a motorcycle I have to push in the clutch, downshift, downshift, wait... and that requires holding up 450lbs between my legs, then let go of the clutch while applying gas and upshifting. Its way more work then stopping on a bike. lol My car is a Prius. I drive a Prius not for my safety (I could have purchased a lot safer vehicles for the same price) but because I think we should do our best to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Every time I have to stop my Prius at a stop light it hurts my vehicles efficiency. Maybe we should make a law that allows EVs and Hybrids to roll through stops too encouraging people to buy more efficient vehicles.   But that would be stupid because the road already has laws. And its stupid to have a bunch of different rules to abide by depending on the mode of transportation you drive.  If this was truly about SAFETY perhaps the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition should work hard to get laws passed in San Francisco requiring helmets and lights at night."

People on bikes can still go 40mph and many do... especially those blowing through red lights/stop signs going downhill.    I don't think you really have a concept of what 40mph feels like on a bicycle and just how few riders are actually capable of going that fast. I can guarantee you you've never seen one going anywhere near that fast while blowing a red light at 16th and Bryant.   Maybe we should make a law that allows EVs and Hybrids to roll through stops too encouraging people to buy more efficient vehicles.   Maybe, but it would fail justification #1. As a driver your vision and hearing are severely impaired by the car around you. You simply don't have anywhere near the situational awareness that someone on a bicycle has. After a week of only biking I find getting behind the wheel of my car somewhat terrifying, like being asked to don earplugs and walk around a city while looking only through binoculars."

Biking is not natural.    It will maybe make cyclists look for cops more at certain intersections, but a bicyclist coming to a complete stop at an intersection is the equivalent requiring a driver to shut off their engine at each stop sign.    That's exactly what modern cars already do.    Enforcement of this will never ever lead to compliance, so why waste the resources on behavior that does not result in injuries anyways?    Do you have any research backing that statement? Or any fundamental reason why enforcement will work for cars, drugs, alcohol, and virtually everything else but not bikes?

Bike citations are such a small percentage of the overall number. Not saying they should be on par with car citations, but something needs to be done to curb the flagrant disregard a lot of bikers have for stop signs and certain other traffic laws.   And it's not either / or - in 1 year, they were able to get Vision Zero citations up from 22% to 33% while simultaneously getting bike + pedestrian citations up from 2% to 6%. Not that Vision Zero is anything but politics, all the police would have to do is stop issuing other citations to automobiles than the selected 5.   Edit: For the record, I barely drive in the city, I support expanding bike lanes where they make sense, and I do think less cars in SF would improve things.

I don't mind police ticketing cyclists when they see them engaging in unsafe behavior, but things like the ""trap"" they set up for months on Arguello are counterproductive and do little to improve safety.  I'd much rather see any kind of policy that discourages driving and encourages more cycling (such as something like the Idaho stop, where cyclists can treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yields), which will have a net reduction in injuries and fatalities pretty much no matter how badly cyclists behave. Anything that discourages people from cycling is going to be less safe overall, increase congestion, and have a detrimental effect."

The benefits of enforcement in this case are essentially a small windfall to the local government in the form of a fine; it pretty clearly has little to no effect on overall cyclist behavior at intersections.  On the other hand, even simple things like helmet laws reduce the incidence of cycling. The benefits of cycling (healthier populace, reduced greenhouse gases, reduced traffic congestion, etc.) are such that any drop in cycling from such a law would completely obliterate the meager benefit.  I'm perfectly fine with liability being on someone who isn't following traffic rules. I'm even perfectly fine with cops ticketing cyclists who they happen to see breaking the law (even though I strongly suspect the net effect of doing so costs society as a whole). But setting up cycling ""traps"" is asinine, when the same amount of enforcement would be better spent curbing bad driver behavior, which is responsible for over two orders of magnitude more deaths, injuries, and property damage than that of cycling."

You're being completely hypocritical here. You're saying that enforcement simultaneously has no effect on cyclist behavior at intersections, but it somehow deters them from bicycling at all? Come on...   But setting up cycling ""traps"" is asinine, when the same amount of enforcement would be better spent curbing bad driver behavior, which is responsible for over two orders of magnitude more deaths, injuries, and property damage than that of cycling.   Setting up traps can be efficient because there are particular areas where traffic is higher and percent of law breaking is also above normal. They can have more benefit for the cost of setting one up than general enforcement - something you seem to be very keen on.   Enforcing all laws requires a balance of resources. You can't say that a given bike trap is necessarily a worse use of resources than using them on drivers. There may be a stretch of road that has a lot of bikers constantly breaking laws, with a history of bikes hitting pedestrians and also being hit by cars and being at fault. That could very well be an efficient use of resources."

Please explain to me why you think we'd be worse off if we reduced enforcement of things like cyclists running stop signs.

Idaho's largest city is a fraction of the population of SF with 1/10 the density.   So what? This is also clearly the de facto situation in SF, and yet cyclists have been responsible for two deaths to others since 1995.

European cities also have much more narrow roads and do enforce bike laws. I spent some time in Amsterdam a few years ago and saw a decent number of bikers getting citations. I'd like to see some data showing they barely enforce bike laws.   I've spent several months cycling across Europe (Zürich, Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Antwerp, and a dozen other areas) and have yet to see a single cyclist receive a ticket. To be fair, I also see a lot less bad behavior from cyclists, ostensibly because there is real bicycle infrastructure there.   So you're saying we need to increase the likelihood of being caught to prevent bad behavior. Gotcha.   An infinitesimal number times ten is still infinitesimal. And as I keep repeating, cyclist bad behavior (which I too find distasteful!) is a blip on the radar in terms of negative impact to others. I am extremely utilitarian when it comes to this. Enforcement isn't simply a mechanism by which you can ""adjust"" cyclist behavior to be better without affecting anything else. In the large, enforcement does almost nothing to change behavior of cyclists (for example, police set up a trap for a few months enforcing cyclists stopping on the downhill at Arguello gate; hang out by there now and tell me if it made a difference), but it will reduce the number of people who decide to cycle.

Cities and states do not have the rights to control immigration.  Homelessness can only be addressed at the national level."

sanfrancisco,3dle26,citronauts,0,Sun Jul 19 02:36:01 2015 UTC,"Ever been to Chinatown, DC?  Sure, it used to have a relatively high concentration of homelessness/people in unstable housing situations.  Now, the streets are glitteringly clean and the only way you know you're in Chinatown is cause Bed, Bath, and Beyond and Chipotle are written in Chinese on their signs.  In a larger sense, both CHI and DC have only managed to shift the burden of its impoverished and homeless to the surrounding suburbs/counties.  Chicago shut down a bunch of public housing in the 90s and dispersed tenants into the surrounding suburbs with little access to transportation*, economic opportunities, and so on.  DC just straight up pushed the poor people out with the wave of gentrification in the 2000's.  Suburb counties like Prince George's county underwent incredible shifts in crime and changes in demographics.  tl;dr the solution to poverty, as others have said, is not to sweep them under the rug and usher in legions of affluent taxpayers.  All you're guaranteed to accomplish is whitewashing your city's neighborhoods with transplants who tend to not give much of a shit if local institutions go under after 40 years.  Cause, hey, Whole Foods carries my favorite VGF meat replacement anyway."
sanfrancisco,3dle26,Helovinas,3,Sun Jul 19 02:49:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been to Chinatown in DC.  I used to live a mile from the PG metro.

Hard to have a sense of what it was like before if you weren't there, but this article touches on it:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/as-homicides-fall-in-dc-rise-in-prince-georges-numbers-meet-in-the-middle/2011/12/21/gIQAjopBTP_story.html  Anyway, I'm not saying SF is doing everything right.  I totally concede that this city has contributed to a positive feedback loop for transient individuals.  The non-profit industrial complex is real, like the ones in academia, the prison system, and the military.  But that's not unique to SF and CHI and DC are by NO means paragons of policy for this city to follow.    Consider that LA has nowhere near the same level of social services, transit infrastructure, and general outreach initiatives, IMO, yet they have a similar homelessness epidemic.  As someone said, part of it is the climate of the area; it's possible to sleep outside here year-around where that couldn't be said for, say, Chicago, which also caps the number of nights people can sleep in a shelter, and doesn't operate 24-hour warming centers unless* when it's 20 below.    Now, if that's what the people of Chicago collectively vote for, then whatever.  On the flipside, DC, which had a spike in meth use and HIV infections when I lived there, tried to put in place a needle exchange, but the House (which controls 100% of DC's budget) struck the initiative down.  In reality, if the people of DC were able to exercise more control over what their budget looked like, the city might look a lot more like SF.  Anyhow.  I see fucked up shit around SF, needles sticking out of arms etc, but I can't tell you how many homeless people I saw in CHI walking around with open wounds that look like infected hamburger.  I've also noticed fewer people here that look like they're in the terminal stages of untreated diabetes.  IDK.  SF values the out-group and that's contributed pretty fundamentally to the city's character.  SF will find a way for itself, one way or another, and if you don't like it, Chicago's got a better club scene anyhow.  :)"

sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,lost_in_blizzard,41,Fri Jul 17 05:49:26 2015 UTC,"I got $30k to move.  Edit - a bit of background:  We were going to move anyway, however before we gave notice out landlords agent contacted us about them wanting to sell the house.  Normally I'd have just said ok we were going to move anyway, however this particular landlord had been a jerk from day one, put our rent up a by $1500 a month over 2 years, didn't disclose that some of the storage in the house would not be available to use when we signed the lease and was generally bad about repairs and maintenance. It's a single family home so no rent control but it did have eviction protection.  I picked a number that would recover all of the rent increases we'd paid.  I probably could have pushed them higher - a single family home in Noe would go for about $200k more empty than it would with a tenant who would have to be OMI or Ellis act evicted. Particularly since we fall into one of the protected categories that require a years notice under the Ellis act.    We considered buying the house but decided it wasn't what we wanted.   They offered $15k (the Ellis act minimum) we countered at $30k and did the deal.  It's not clear if they sold the house, it was pending then the listing was removed. We're very happy in our new rent controlled apartment in Pac Heights, great building, great manager."

sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,poser4life,8,Fri Jul 17 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"Not only does this make complete economic sense, there's a straightforward mathematical way to calculate the value of a buyout.  If market rate for the apartment is $X, and you're paying $Y -- the owner is missing out on $ X-Y in income. Economically speaking, if he pays you some number less than the present value of an $ X-Y income stream -- he's better off.   The math of present value may seem complicated if you're not familiar with it, but if the rent and discount rate stayed constant -- the present value would be (X-Y)/i, where i is the discount (interest) rate.   Of course, rents are increasing (at different rates which makes the differential grow) and discount rates will change. That makes the calculation slightly (but not much) more complicated. If the owner has any sense at all, he's making this calculation."
sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,Zharol,5,Fri Jul 17 15:47:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, while this is the Econ 201 calculation, you aren't thinking about this with behavioral economics or game theoretically. If they offer every time, everyone will ask. A smart landlord would not accept offers out of the blue, rather only present offers when the owner WANTS the person to move. Then make offers occasionally."
sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,scoofy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:09:11 2015 UTC,I was careful to use the word value. That's not necessarily (or realistically) what the owner will offer or pay -- but it's what it's worth.  A smart owner is going to only rarely offer. A smart renter should always ask.
sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,Zharol,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"Do you mean the federal interest rate? Let's say I'm paying $1000 for an apartment the landlord can rent out for $2000 if I move. The discount rate is apparently 3.25%  so that means 1000/0.0325 = $30,769 as an approximately reasonable number?"
sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,openzeus,5,Fri Jul 17 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"No, he is using a ""discount rate"" which is a rate determined by doing a little finance math (you can look up CAPM if you would like).  Real estate valuations typically work off whats called a ""CAP rate"".  summary of cap rates  The best way to know what the current cap rate in the market is would be to call a few commercial real estate brokers and ask them what the current multifamily cap rate is.    Keep in mind, what ever you calculate should be discounted further since increasing rent from x to y does not mean that the NOI (Net Operating Income) will increase by exactly that much.  Also, uncertainty may also discount it.  Also, the landlord is going to have to come with cash out of pocket. $30k may be a lot of money for someone who has a bunch of low yielding, rent controlled apartments."
sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,citronauts,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:06:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the discount rate makes a huge difference in the calculation. Yet they're constantly changing, and not everyone is going to agree on the precise one to use. (Though almost everyone is going to agree on a ballpark related to risk, so the rate openzeus chose is out.)  Couple that with nobody knowing what future rents will be (since it's mathematically impossible for SF rents to increase at recent rates for a long period) and you can have two reasonable people coming up with very different estimates. That's why there's a market and negotiation."
sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,Zharol,2,Fri Jul 17 18:30:29 2015 UTC,"yeap, exactly.  Your point about yearly vs monthly below is extremely important and would easily be overlooked by someone who didn't know how this works.   Probably the best way to figure out what you could get on a buyout would be to take the annual difference and multiply it by somewhere between 1 and 3.   paying $1000 in a $2000 unit.    That is a $1,000 a month difference, or $12,000 a year.  Multiple $12,000 by 3 = $36,000.  Accept somewhere between $12,000 and $36,000 for the buyout.   3X revenue is likely the most anyone would realistically pay, even though they are getting 20X in value.  The uncertainty and the fact that so much cash has to come out of pocket makes it impossible for them to pay out the full 20x."
sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,citronauts,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:06:06 2015 UTC,"You need to be careful about time periods. Use a monthly discount rate with monthly rent, or an annual discount rate with annual rent.   Also, there isn't a fixed discount rate. Discount rates reflect the value being placed on cash flows of varying risk -- citronauts gave a reasonable one (your landlord may assess differently, part of what makes a market).  If you really were paying half market rent, the economic value being lost by the owner is huge (half the value of the unit). He's not going to pay you that full amount for a couple of reasons. First, he could just sell and receive the full value. Second, you'll take a lot less (as is obvious by the folks in this thread getting excited about tens of thousands). And he'd also want a healthy profit in excess of his costs related with dealing with you."

And that's totally fair! It's your property, and you are free to do with it what you please. I disagree vehemently with the blog posts that imply people who don't rent their spaces are somehow 'holding out' on the good people that want to live there.  I'm a firm believer in rent-control and pro-tenant ordinances. All of those things make finding a place a real hassle for sure -- but if it wasn't profitable, no one would do it. Lots of people do, though, so I'm not willing to budge on those protections for the renters."

sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,TheAntiPedantic,3,Fri Jul 17 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The property in question isn't subject to rent control, and isn't already rented, so it's not about the amount of rent charged, which would be fairly lucrative. It's just the difficulties that could be encountered if we needed to move back in, or if we weren't happy with the tenant. We should in theory be able to do an owner move in, but from what I have learned from others, nothing is trivial in this regard. All I'm saying is that anecdotally amongst my friends who own property, very few are interested in offsetting the cost of owning their property / homes with long term renters due to the perceived risks. Certainly there are others who are more financially strapped (aka ""house poor"") and have no choice but to do it. I think the good intentions of tenants rights have backfired to some degree and created a more scarce and desperate rental environment for everyone. I've been renting here for decades starting in the 80's and the whole non-need-based rent control thing struck me as weird even then."

One of the (few) windfalls of being a renter in this city is that sometimes you can seek a payout for leaving. I wouldn't weep for the landlord, they are sitting in the catbird seat whether they pay or not. The payment, bear in mind, is voluntary, they're free to let you continue living there and collect the lower level of rent.  I'm no apologist for capitalism, but this is just how that game is played. They'd exploit you and they often do. The person who bought a house in SF back in the early 90s didn't ""deserve"" to see their investment triple in size, but they got that just the same."

In this case if the assumption that the tenant will leave regardless of if the actual buy out occurs, there is no change in supply.  Assuming that the renter doesn't reenter the rental market, buyer demand also does not change.  What does change is the profitability of the landlord, it decreases.  You can make an argument that with less profitability, the market of landlords will decrease (to those operating on low margins) and the reduction could be so great to create less, high-quality options available to renters."

Rent-controlled apartments are subsidized by newer or future renters who have to make up the shortfall. That 1 bedroom going for $4k is because the neighbor has been paying $1,500 for years, even though they could each rent for $2,250.

It's going for $4k because they can rent them for $4k... each. You can fairly argue that rent control has some (somewhat hard to quantify) impact on reducing availability and thus raising the demand price. That still doesn't come close to fixing the very wrong economic principle you displayed with your $2,250 example.  That apartment, fresh on the fresh market, will be rented at $4k whether the landlord pays the tenant $7,500 or $0. Prior subsidy has nothing to do with it.

Landlords charge rent based on what makes the most financial sense for them. They don't raise or lower rent based on fees they paid to some chick last year, that doesn't make any sense."
sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,WillRedditForBeer,-5,Fri Jul 17 15:40:00 2015 UTC,"^ Landlords charge rent based on what makes the most financial sense for them.   That's the only smart thing you said. Everything else is an assumption on what I think about how a property owner/manager operates, and a terrible example involving hotdogs, which does not compare to housing. Hotdogs are consumable and not subject to market influences in SF like housing, unless hotdogs are made of houses."
sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,_garr,10,Fri Jul 17 15:51:57 2015 UTC,"Ok, screw hot dogs. A landlord has a house to rent in SF. He can get $2k/mo and rent it out now, or maybe get $2.2k/mo if he lets it sit a few months and hopes someone bites.  Now that landlord gets fined $100k by the IRS. How much should he lease his unit for? $20k? $50k? For just $100k/mo he can pay off his debts in 1 month!  I don't understand how you think landlords work. They don't get to invent a magical price and people will pay it. They list their places at market rates, it's the maximum amount they can get for it. This isn't rocket science."
sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,WillRedditForBeer,-5,Fri Jul 17 15:55:21 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how you think landlords work.   Thank you for that. The point I am making is that there is a direct cause and effect when a landlord/property manager suffers a loss, it has a trickle down effect across ALL their properties.    You argue that the effect is stretched over a long period of time, and thus distilled. I agree with you, but you cite a model where a landlord owns and rents a single unit. I argue that case is not the norm as SF has many more apartment buildings that are renter occupied instead of single family homes or duplexes. I see compounded losses having collateral damage in the form of less caring and updating to ALL properties in the owners/landlords portfolio; A ripple effect, impacting all housing managed by that one property owner/manager.   The owners/managers are limited to market rate economics, and they still need to meet their expected profit margins, all on the back of a renter's quality of home/life."
sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,orageslointains,2,Fri Jul 17 16:10:51 2015 UTC,"man, you don't understand this sf market at all.  1) the rate for the new renter will be market determined; 2) increases ""across all owner's properties"" will either be determined by what the market will bear (if non-rent controlled) or regulation (if rent controlled); 3) maintenance is regulated, refusing to maintain properties is an adjudicable issue with financial penalites, paint can peel carpets can be cleaned less but nothing that really matters can decline significantly, otherwise the tenant is entitled to reduced rent.  basically, in sf, there's no point at which the 7500$ payment can be extracted from other tenants."
sanfrancisco,3dlg2z,OneRedSent,2,Fri Jul 17 18:12:27 2015 UTC,"I think what /u/WillRedditForBeer is saying (and correct me if I'm wrong) is that if the landlord still had the $7500 in his pocket, he might decide to put new carpet in his units (for example), but now he can't so the new tenants have to live with the old carpet. It's not an illegal carpet, but it's not as nice as it could have been. And actually with new carpet, the unit might rent for slightly more, so the landlord might be losing a couple hundred a month in lower rent too."

If the market can sustain your property at that ""extra"" $625/month, I hope you'd have the sense to price it that way to begin with, $7500 buy out or not. Anything lower and you're willfully refusing money.   It's a shitty thing to do   Why did they agree to it if they can't afford it? This is what I don't understand from this argument. Why am I supposed to feel sorry for someone who makes a business deal that is not in their best interest? No one forced them to. Just like I don't feel sorry for anyone (including myself) who pays outrageous rent. We all make that choice every time we sign the papers.   Do you go up to the counter at your local grocer and say, 'are you sure you don't want me to pay more for this? It seems like you can't afford to sell this produce at such a low price.'  Do you go to a used car dealership and say, 'Hey, I'm not sure you know what you're doing here -- this price is too little for this kind of car. How about I throw in an extra 2 grand?'  Do you go to a realter and say, 'I'd like to buy this place for $750k over asking?' (Oh shit, nevermind...)  Edit: One other reason you won't find sympathy in this sub is that it's a landlord's market. Housing is in high demand and you can ask for pretty much whatever you want. I know that your rental property is in another state where the market probably isn't outrageous, but in that case -- you'd just refuse to shell out the $7500."

Nothing's forcing the landlord to accept.   In SF, because rent price market rates are increasing quickly and rent control freezes the rents of older tenants, the landlord will often make more money in the long run by accepting a buyout. It's a win-win situation."

There is a long list of pre-2001 movies where San Francisco gets destroyed. And New York City got destroyed in a few movies post-2001 as well."

Reddit's laissez faire style might have worked when the site was small but with some big subs having 6 million readers it's clear that mods are hugely important.

sanfrancisco,3djfmh,_garr,6,Fri Jul 17 15:49:33 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the tech side of things skews this quite a bit. Rent as a percentage of average income is directly tied to average income. If the average income is 100K because of high paid workers you're not going to reach that 30% as quick as a place with a 25k average income. The more high paid tech workers the greater rent can be and still be considered ""affordable"". But, that doesn't mean much to non tech workers. If you're making $15 an hour in SF you probably don't care that housing is relatively affordable to those making 200K a year. That doesn't change reality for those being priced out."

So if Uber handed over it's data and San Francisco found, for example, that most of the rides in SF went to whites and Asians (or pickups in neighborhoods that aren't Hunter's Point, eg), rather than Latinos and black people, they could interpret that as a sign that Uber is somehow discriminating against Latinos and black people, when in fact it's just usage bias (whites and Asians way more likely to use smartphones/ridesharing apps in San Francisco, and comprise like 75% of the population).  Data can easily be massaged to fit whatever narrative you see fit, (and forget the competition angle), and Uber knows this."

I told them sure and they sent me a phone and activated my account and told me I'm good to go without performing the 19 point safety inspection required by the CPUC. Huge slap to the face to those of us that fought for regulation and put our faces out there in front of California Commissioners in the name of ride-sharing. Told them to keep their money and haven't considered driving for them since. Its also pretty comical on the amount of Uber drivers I currently still fail during my mentor rides because their vehicles still don't pass that safety inspection or they fail Lyfts dl background check.

It's so algorithmic I suspect y'all are a bunch of bots.   post link to local vitriolic ""article"" without any added original content add libertarian vitriol pointing finger in wrong direction profit?   Oh, then there's the step where someone like me comes in and says, ""no, it's complicated"" and gets a drizzle of downvotes. Maybe I'm a bot too.  So, regarding the Old Mint, here's the ""it's complicated"" part. No one knows what to do with this amazing structure, and any government folks who are wrassling with the problem are thinking about a lot bigger-ticket issues than a handful of homeless guys in tents.  (I'll point out here that, by the pictures, the homeless folks here are not running a bike chop shop, so that already puts them toward the bottom of the list of homeless deserving our ire.)   ...building is in a transitional period, as the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society, which had occupied the mint, is still moving out after being evicted by the city   The Mint is a sad albatross with no simple solution. Grumpy-youngman would say raze it and build 70 stories now! I'd say let's find a good spot and relocate it and build 16 stories...anyway, there are a lot of entrenched reasons neither of these are going to happen. Top of these reasons is that it's an historic structure and we'd need to change a raft of laws to work around that.  So it sits and various folks try their hand at making some hodgepodge use our of it. I got called to consult on some audio issues there last year by the group now getting evicted, and it was an eye-opener.  If you haven't been inside, I recommend it. They don't build em like that any more, so the structure, history, etc are fascinating. Equally fascinating is the complete fail which is the attempt to cobble a modern use out of it. Modern use = put people into the building, duh. Okay, an occupancy permit means fire sprinklers. But historic structure = no punching holes thru the walls. Okay, we'll run the sprinkler lines outside the walls and STRAIGHT THROUGH DOORWAYS as needed. Pic 24 of the sfgate article shows exactly what I'm talking about. It's quite insane. I saw no solutions I could offer for their problems and ran away quickly.  So yeah, it's no surprise to me that making the homeless ""move along"" from the Mint steps is low priority. Move along for what? The building has no use.  tl;dr It's complicated, but you knew a wishy-washy liberal like me would say that. Now back to the normal circle jerk and don't forget to re-post this story tomorrow."

sanfrancisco,3diflz,Octoplop,2,Thu Jul 16 19:10:44 2015 UTC,"The Old Mint is one of few buildings in this city with a historic landmark distinction that deserves it.  It survived the 1906 fires.  It still has space for horse parking in the basement.  It would be great to see it put to a great use, like the Armory has been.  I don't think anyone would get far arguing here that we should tear it down."
sanfrancisco,3diflz,TheAntiPedantic,6,Thu Jul 16 17:34:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want to raze this building for a high rise! I'd sell it to the highest bidder who wants to turn the existing structure into a gym, night club, or tech office ;)  I think your comment is astute. But I just can't believe that letting homeless build camps on the elevated steps of a central historic landmark in a bustling commercial/business area is the right thing to do. It almost sounds like a narrative from a dystopian fiction book."
sanfrancisco,3diflz,grumpy_youngMan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:45:25 2015 UTC,"Gym is one fun idea. That could totally fit. But couldn't do showers without changing that raft of laws...but you could put the showers outside...and then the homeless could use them too! Win/win!  They did have dance parties in the courtyard (never attended, but that was the one area where audio reinforcement DID work). Clearly still not enough of a revenue stream to pay the rent, though.  I agree, it presents a dystopian image and doesn't add to SFs charm. I wish there was some solution. Dat gymnasium idea though..."
sanfrancisco,3diflz,cunty_cuntington,2,Thu Jul 16 17:26:22 2015 UTC,"But historic structure = no punching holes thru the walls.   I find that hard to believe. Usually landmarks preservation boards give owners a reasonable amount of wiggle room when it comes to adaptive reuse and retrofitting. That is, if you can argue that the rules are making the building unusable then you're allowed to break them."
sanfrancisco,3diflz,unpickle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:01:51 2015 UTC,"And yet, there are those sprinklers, stopping every door in the building from closing.  I won't pretend to have followed the Mint's post-89 history closely, so I don't know how it came to this. Perhaps those shitty sprinklers could be pulled out and holes could be punched in the walls. Perhaps steel framing could be added a la typical seismic retrofits.  I'd love for someone to chime in, who has real info. It would be great to understand why the Mint has had a different arc from the old Post Office on 7th/Stevenson, which is a similar building in broad strokes. And yet it had a lovely rehab and is now the home of the 9th circuit court. (Another gorgeous building to go inside if you get the chance...fantastic mosaics.) I suspect the federal govt was able to use some sort of force majeure in order to make it happen, and SF doesn't have the same sort of muscle to make magic with the Mint.  (i know, I'm using force majeure wrong...eminent domain? 800-lb-gorilla? ianal)"
sanfrancisco,3diflz,cunty_cuntington,0,Thu Jul 16 18:38:31 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet the Historical Society (or whoever paid for the work) was just short on cash but wanted to get the retrofit done as soon as possible so they could start using the building.
sanfrancisco,3diflz,unpickle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:43:47 2015 UTC,"But as landlord, why would the city sign off on that? Hmm, maybe this all happened when we were broke. If the sprinkler arrangement was preventable, I'm mad. It's so absurd, I assumed it wasn't."

Here are some more photos of interior doors in the Mint. No sprinklers.

I promise you, the architects' photos you linked to must be before that conduit was placed. There are a few foyer doors on the first floor not blocked, but that's it. In the basement, 100% of doors are blocked.  It was well over a year ago I was there. I had two mental notes re the blocked doors and sprinklers. I think my sprinkler note must have been: there are none.  So it's electrical, not sprinklers blocking the doors. I don't think it really changes my point here (although it would be somewhat easier to correct than iron high pressure water pipe...but now we see the additional issue of the building being un-sprinklered). The best way to satisfy yourself with ""evidence"" would be to take a visit yourself!"

In the long run it's probably cheaper...(plus think of all the bus driving jobs it would create)...a national migratory cycle of passing the buck from one city to the next and back again.  Or the other other alternative...just euthanize them all! Because honestly, nobody really cares about the homeless or is willing to chip in to see anything actually be done to help them.

The conversation was well managed to include many different viewpoints and direct opportunity to weigh in around the group.   It's informative to hear directly from those arguing emphatically to reign in ""freeze peaches"" rather than through written word. I have suspected a significant factor in disagreement are different definition of what free speech means. To me free speech means the ability to have a conversation about the godamn TPP or CISPA openly in related news subreddits without those conversations being removed from public sight.

And, indeed, when The New York Times reviewed Pinterest in 2012, they rightly referred to it as ""female-oriented,"" but when the CEO of a 74 percent male social network resigns after facing intense criticism from its users—much of it laced with misogyny—they somehow forget to label Reddit, in turn, as ""male-oriented."" Reddit too often passes in the media as unmarked and neutral territory while sites like Pinterest get pigeonholed as girly."
sanfrancisco,3dg6x9,eean,4,Thu Jul 16 17:39:32 2015 UTC,"This may be a matter of proper interpretation of summary statistics, but I have been trying to better understand reddit demographics as reported by Alexa.  The bottom of the page reports 'Who visits reddit.com?'   Audience Demographics  How similar is this site's audience to the general internet population?   Relative to the general internet population females are reported as over-represented, and males under-represented. With a high degree of confidence.   Pinterest demographics as reported by Alexa for comparison.  I'm left wondering how a site with such a wide range of subreddit for every interest with greater than average internet female population can be generalized as:   It’s the front page of the Internet for young men. That’s it. That’s all it ever was. And every statistic backs it up. Source.   Sounds like we're describing 4chan here.  Really reddit is a glorified web forum that made improvements to filtering conversation and streamlined creation of new topic boards. Every range from the good to the bad to be found on the internet may be found in some representation of the site. The internet has its Ebaumsworld, SomethingAwful, StileProject, LiveLeak, and multitude of horrific sites. With such a wide demographic those interested in such things are represented right alongside those who love fluffay kitties.   It's too easy to fire up reddit and pluck some salacious quote to write the next article. The click-baits and special interests are having a field day."

sanfrancisco,3dg6x9,eean,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:22:46 2015 UTC,"I suspect it has to do with the surprising results, such as Simpson's Paradox, with aggregated statistics.   If what you're trying to get at is 'Do women like this site?' or 'Do men like this site?' looking at the raw counts could provide useless results.   For exaggerated example, lets say there are 12 million females and 41 million males on the internet. Pinterest numbers might show 9 million females and 10 million males view the site. From this it would technically be correct to state that 52.6% of site visitors are male but it's probably not reasonable to then state that Pinterest is more popular with the male demographic. If instead we look at gender internet population averages we see 75% of the female internet population, and 26% of the male internet population are visiting.   Alexa has probably found that results in relation to the internet average population is a more reasonable measure of whether a gender tends to like a site.

I was too young for it and it initially terrified me -- once you navigated a mirror maze, you'd come to the entrance and be greeted by explosive air vents mounted in the floor. Those badly startled me. With further exploration, I began to really enjoy it. There was a mechanically rotating ""Barrel of Fun"" and two excellent wood slides, one of which was at least three stories high. I particularly enjoyed these little corridors with abruptly pumping floors that put you off balance when you walked them. The whole thing was a museum of stuff you can't do to kids anymore without terrifying an insurance lawyer.

There was old games from the amusement park. All the games still cost a nickel or penny. And  it was awesome.they moved them down to fishermans warf and now cost quarters and more than one. Really really sad   I really can't believe. Even though I can because of what the city is turning into. That they took that down at the beach. It was for the everyday folk. Now they changed it to that fancy restaurant and pretty much killed the cliff house. It's really sad to witness

(Fun fact: SFPD is supposed to maintain a list of ""Saturday night special"" handguns on an annual basis to be prohibited from sale. It's never done it once.)  This is just another poorly thought-out law designed to make it look like the sponsor (Mark Ferrell) is doing something about gun crime, when in fact all he's doing is hassling gun owners.

sanfrancisco,3dh1no,SakisRakis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:50:23 2015 UTC,"The words ""can be"" seldom have deterrent value.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person who, in the commission of a felony specified in subdivision (a), personally uses a firearm, shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for 10 years. The firearm need not be operable or loaded for this enhancement to apply.

If it is not hard to reference the Penal Code, why did you fail to do so before opining on the state of the law in California?  I am sorry you see having it pointed out that the solution is not as simple as you see it is only    shitting on [your] ideas   but maybe you should spend a bit more time thinking through issues before offering a solution.   Reducing the total number of guns in the United States is the only measure that would meaningfully impact gun violence, but a combination of political and constitutional roadblocks prevent that sort of policy movement."

The Chron published a whole series of articles about this airbnb effect on the housing market. They say the data ""bolsters"" claims about subjective outcomes claimed by people who want to regulate airbnb. But all these stats and analyses and column inches are unworthy of the time of their readership.  Before slicing and dicing this data set to try to cluster hosts into various categories or show which categories are growing or shrinking, it would be good to see whether all the categories combined could possibly make a difference or not.  Consider the Egan criterion: how many units does my policy proposal create, compared to the number (100000) the city's Chief Economist thinks would be needed to have a significant impact on housing prices? The 350 housing units we're putting under a microscope score 0.0035 on this measure, meaning that we need to shut down airbnb and 286 other, similarly-widespread housesharing services to have a meaningful impact. There do not exist 286 services comparable to airbnb, so the proposed regulations cannot begin to address the problem that motivates us.  Who cares whether these hosts rent daily or yearly, for a day or a month at a time, where their properties are, etc.? It's very clear from that first, simplest statistic that the claimed effect is so tiny it may as well not exist."

Here the state is  using resources to deny an individual their rights, so they aren't in compliance with the law.  An example of the latter would be recreational use of controlled substances, legal in some states, but still illegal at the federal level.

Do you think their agents come in during the day and think about how SF city policy is driving down crime or preventing a flu epidemic, and how their practices for apprehending illegals impacts that?

sanfrancisco,3dc6ju,kryptoniterazor,12,Wed Jul 15 04:47:20 2015 UTC,Politicians are people who have opinions.

And if every time you talked to that organization your words and decisions were twisted against your will into a message you do not support, I'm sure you'd be more and more hesitant about talking to them at all.

Let me quote some snippets from the article:   Two-thirds of the money in his arsenal — $461,479 — came from public financing, raising questions about just how tightly the city monitors the spending of taxpayer dollars doled out to mayoral candidates under the city’s generous campaign financing law.  The newly completed audit of his 2011 campaign found that Avalos’ committee “failed to maintain complete campaign records” for more than $391,000 in spending, or 60 percent of the total.  According to auditors who searched bank records, that included $631 paid for Web services to his then-wife, Karen Zapata, and $21,984 to his City Hall aide and campaign consultant, Raquel Redondiez, with whom he later confessed to having an affair.  Avalos, by the way, didn’t spend every last dime he got from the city. Along with his letter to the Ethics Commission, he enclosed a check for $46,966 that was still sitting in a bank account — begging the question of why it took four years to return the unspent funds."

I am also in favor of regulations on unzoned commercial, non-inhabitant use of real estate that's zoned for residential occupancy, which is scarce to begin with."

sanfrancisco,3dejjw,old_gold_mountain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:44:03 2015 UTC,"And the above report substantiated with research / data shows that it's a mere drop in the bucket when it comes to contributing to residential scarcity. 0.1% of all housing, and who knows if those 350 units would even end up on the rental market if Airbnb weren't available. There are other arguments against Airbnb, but you're barking up the wrong tree by taking this angle."
sanfrancisco,3dejjw,sfthrow87,2,Thu Jul 16 00:51:38 2015 UTC,"Look, I didn't even say what kind of regulation I'd be willing to advocate for and you're already saying I'm being irrational.

sanfrancisco,3dejjw,old_gold_mountain,0,Thu Jul 16 00:56:31 2015 UTC,"I'm going off of what you said in your reply:   They are not necessarily the same people.   Then you go on to talk about yourself as an example of not being the same people as those against development, implying you're on the side of those faulting Airbnb for removing ""scarce housing"". If you're not, that's fine, but what you've stated definitively implies you are.   Airbnb, in general, increases efficiency of a scarce resource. It's a step in the right direction - ultimately, less hotels need to be built, which frees up that space for other development. That a small fraction of Airbnb units are being used full-time, and might contribute up to 350 units back to the housing market, is a ridiculous argument."
sanfrancisco,3dejjw,sfthrow87,2,Thu Jul 16 01:03:43 2015 UTC,"Are you asking whether I believe that AirBnB incentivizes uses of property zoned for residential use as commercial, non-residential endeavors, thereby reducing the number of units available to residents? Then yes, that is something I believe. Large quantity, small quantity - I don't know. Part of the reason I don't know is because we have very little public data to go on other than meta-analysis. But whatever the quantity, that claim is true.  Also note that this isn't just 350 units total on AirBnB - this is 350 units being rented full time which is a violation of city regulations. How many more are being rented nearly full time? If we created a metric such as ""unit-days"" measuring how many days of potential unit occupancy are being removed, what would that look like? The equivalent would be a lot greater than just 350 units if I were to venture a guess."

Gentrification is inevitable. There's nothing we can do to stop the highest bidder from visiting and living in SF.

But you can bet your ass that if I could afford to buy a house in SF but only live there a few weeks or months a year, or a few days a week (it would be ideal for me right now), I would fucking not rent it full-time, and instead AirBnb it, so that I can be flexible enough to occupy it when I'm there, and get a revenue from it when I'm not.  Now sure, there are existing zoning laws and regulations in the City. The question is - do those make any fucking sense nowadays? The answer is no. In fact, they never had. SF always had an underground B&B industry.  Keep going with the status quo, and all that empty apartment/house inventory will just remain empty, or be leased under the table to friends and family (or for free).  Or you could try what some radical lefties have been pushing for in some Western European countries, which is to force those landlords to rent. Good luck with that plan."

sanfrancisco,3dbolb,Kovnerbielski,7,Wed Jul 15 05:13:56 2015 UTC,Nice! A few questions:  Where is this located?  What happened to that poor streetcar?  How did you get access to take these photos?
sanfrancisco,3dbolb,PhaZePhyR,10,Wed Jul 15 03:14:17 2015 UTC,The Muni Metro East rail facility is located in the Dogpatch area. It is a brand new state of the art rail maintenance facility that the city is bring up to full capacity.   The smashed up streetcar was in an accident with an 18 wheeler in January 2014. The shop has not been able to attain the funds to properly fix the streetcar. The car is so old and has such specialized mechanisms and the damage is so extensive that they have not yet been able to properly fix it.   How did I take these photos: I am SFMTA employee.
sanfrancisco,3dbolb,CalebIO,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:39:23 2015 UTC,Do the trains ride to the facility via the rail? Or do they need to be transported there by some other means?
sanfrancisco,3dbolb,PhaZePhyR,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:35:17 2015 UTC,the facility is connected to the T line. It is not only the maintenance facility but the holding yard for all of the LRV trains. in the morning almost every LRV comes out of MME

sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,Ores,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:27:36 2015 UTC,"Cops live in the burbs so the crime wave doesn't affect them. (been living there since white flight so they don't have the excuse that they can't afford the city)  Also, judges don't prosecute, I wouldn't be surprised if they live in some of the posh suburbs as well. Releasing criminals back onto city streets doesn't affect their quality of life."
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,Kraam,15,Tue Jul 14 23:56:33 2015 UTC,"Judges don't prosecute, prosecutors do.  That said, you have a point. It's not the SFPD that's the problem here, it's the SF District Attorney's office, which won't do jackshit about this."
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,arnaudh,2,Wed Jul 15 02:23:41 2015 UTC,I'm actually really surprised to find out that the SFPD makes an effort to combat bike theft. A lot of other places would see this as a low priority.   I've chatted with Officer Matt Friedman a couple times and he's definitely doing what he can with what little resources he has. I've even tweeted the SFPDbiketheft account with pics of stolen bikes/chop shops and received back photos of the police responding and confiscating said bikes.
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,essef_sf,2,Thu Jul 16 22:04:01 2015 UTC,That's great. But don't expect the DA to do much prosecuting about it. The SFPD might respond if you tell them that you found your bike somewhere and the thief. But don't expect that guy to get prosecuted.
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,arnaudh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:09:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly. I'm just glad they are setting a precedent by taking the bikes.   Prosecution would just be a big circle jerk and it's never going to be a deterrent — those guys don't have much to lose, so why not keep doing it? However, if your finding your inventory consistently seized, well that's not so good for business."
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,essef_sf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:13:13 2015 UTC,"Well, thanks to Prop 47, it now take at least a $950 bike to make a bicycle theft a felony. So it's not like those thieves give a shit."
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,arnaudh,10,Fri Jul 17 00:18:48 2015 UTC,"Most SFPD officers would rather a shorter commute; driving anywhere around here is absolutely brutal.  They live out there because, as far as an old SFPD cop was concerned, raising a family in San Francisco was hideously dangerous before it was prohibitively expensive. Not exactly the most accurate conclusion, but lots of cops don't want to live where they work. Familiarity breeds contempt and all that.  Consider the following anecdote. A former coworker of mine brought his little girl to a toy store one day, to get her something or another. He ran into some scary homeless guy he'd booked the other week. The homeless guy recognized him and threatened to rape his daughter, while she was standing right there.   He moved out of town about a year later."
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,bird_person_forever,2,Wed Jul 15 02:11:37 2015 UTC,"""Releasing criminals back on to city streets.""  You can thank the California voters, in part, for that one. Prop 47 makes it so that if a bike thief is caught and arrested, they'll be given a citation, and then they walk away. Off to steal another bike. Prop 47 also removed custodial arrest for continuing offenses, so cops could catch and cite the same thief ten times in a day for the same crime and he/she will still only be cited each time.  So, a portion of your issue has nothing to do with cops or judges, it has to do with what the voters wanted because they were mislead into thinking Prop 47 was all about drug offenses."
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,sam_burke,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:00:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I love it, voters pass law that make it easier for criminals to avoid jail time and then they blame the police because the streets are full of them. You reap what you sow, if you want a society where punishment for crime is trivial, be prepared to deal with more crime."
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,BBjustice47,2,Wed Jul 15 22:15:48 2015 UTC,But I mean you have to hand it to the voters. I feel as though the public wants to reduce the insane overcrowding that is in our prison system. Prop 47 might not be a perfect set of laws but at least it is something rather than nothing.
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,livinlife2hard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:21:02 2015 UTC,Cops don't live in the burbs.. cops live in the Sunset/Richmond. I guess the burbs? I live here and certainly wouldn't call it the burbs lol..
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,mhallgren5,13,Wed Jul 15 14:59:30 2015 UTC,"Here's a startup I'd like to see: a AAA for bikes / insurance company / bike bounty hunter firm.   You pay them a nominal monthly fee. Maybe $10-$20, sliding scale based on the value of your bike. They hire an army of people to patrol the city and intervene in bike theft when they witness it, and attempt to recover your bike when it gets stolen. If they find it, you get your bike back. If they don't, they cut you a check for the value of the bike so you can replace it.   When we moved to the Bay Area I told our State Farm agent that we wanted Renter's Insurance with a deductible low enough that it would cover a stolen bike. She told me that State Farm does not cover bike theft in California because, and I quote, ""bike theft is too common here."" THAT'S THE POINT! That's why I want the friggin insurance!! We've always carried renter's with a low deductible to cover stolen bikes. When my husband's bike was stolen two years ago in Washington state, he got a check to replace it. We can't get that here. Drives me nuts!"
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,soundslikepuget,8,Wed Jul 15 00:00:36 2015 UTC,Put tracking devices in bikes. Problem solved! The tracking device will have to be in hidden in the frame so the thieves can't remove it easily.
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,webauteur,2,Wed Jul 15 01:14:49 2015 UTC,"There's a thing called Tile that seems great in theory. Basically crowdsourced GPS.   Also, my renter's insurance covers bike theft, or at least they told me it did when I asked explicitly and there's no clauses in the contract that indicate it doesn't. I think I use State Farm so you could check that out again if it's still a problem for you."
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,openzeus,3,Wed Jul 15 02:19:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting. The problem was that they wouldn't write a deductible low enough to cover the value of the bike. We're Bay Area Broke-asses, so we ride $300 bikes. I think the mimimum State Farm would write was either $500 or $1000 if memory serves. Was able to get some other company to write a lower one"
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,soundslikepuget,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:47:56 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. My bike is the most, and only, expensive thing I own since it's my main method of transportation. I basically only have renter's insurance to cover the bike. I think I have a $500 deductible as well, so it's useful for me but I can see how it's not useful if your bike is less than that amount."
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,openzeus,3,Wed Jul 15 13:42:32 2015 UTC,"How do you do that in such a way that it doesn't run out of battery? I know US Passports have an RFID chip in them that can be read from 10 feet away, and they never (need? run out of?) power.

Yes, I know that the $10 a month I mentioned I would pay for it in a little over a year, but for a Bay Area broke-ass like me, that's a big difference.   There's a lot of us at the bottom of the economic ladder that can swing $10 a month for a service (eg, neftlix) but can't swing $150 for a product."
sanfrancisco,3dbb9s,soundslikepuget,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:07:52 2015 UTC,"It's nowhere near cost effective for me either - but hopefully things like this will become more common, and the costs will come down.

This next part is probably gonna be unpopular, but am I missing something with the dude that got all those bikes stolen? It seems to me that after the second break common sense would kick in and you would either not leave the bikes in the garage, or lock them up inside the garage.

sanfrancisco,3dfiho,ahminus,2,Thu Jul 16 00:16:40 2015 UTC,"I would think total inventory is the proper metric. Assume there are 1 billion units currently rented, 100 units available for rent, and 100 units off the market on airbnb. Do you really care that airbnb represents 100% of the currently available units or doesn't it make more sense to say airbnb has taken 0.0001% of the supply off the market. I mean, in that scenario, if you put them on the market, they'd get snatched up in 2 seconds and there would still be only 100 units available at any given time. I don't understand how comparing quantity of airbnb units to to available units is very meaningful."
sanfrancisco,3dfiho,_garr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:13:26 2015 UTC,"relevant to what question or claim?  Many people are interested in the question of whether further regulations (or outright prohibition) of airbnb would decrease housing prices. For that question, it's not useful to compare airbnb count to ""on the market"" inventory, because the market inventory is turning over very rapidly. I.e., the hundreds of hypothetical new, low-priced inventory units created by airbnb shutdown would be quickly rented and would vanish from the market.  Another useful stat to consider would be the Egan criterion: how many units does my policy proposal create, compared to the number (100000) the city's Chief Economist thinks would be needed to have a significant impact on housing prices? For reference, the airbnb proposal scores 0.0035 on this measure, meaning that we need to shut down airbnb and 286 other, similarly-widespread housesharing services to have a meaningful impact. Sadly those 286 businesses do not exist."

sanfrancisco,3da1ed,genericactionhero,6,Tue Jul 14 22:10:18 2015 UTC,Except rent control laws allow people who already live here to continue living here... Which accomplishes the intended goal of any possible solution to the crisis. It's literally the point of the whole thing
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,Buying2wheels,14,Tue Jul 14 23:46:15 2015 UTC,They also allow people like myself to pay a rental rate that is well below market. Which removes the incentive to move to a different neighborhood so rent controlled apartment will not change hands.  Its a perverse incentive. I want to move but if I move no matter where even a worse location it will cost me more than my current place so why would I move?  If I didnt have rent control I would be force to  think about moving as the rent went up each year. With rent control you never think about that 20 years go by and then bam your evicted surprise surprise.
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,kill-9all,8,Wed Jul 15 02:21:49 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why rent control ends up raising rent and hurting everyone. The incentive system behind rent control is to never move. It doesn't matter if you moved in single, but now have three kids and would normally upgrade to a better spot. This ends up with a net reduction in supply as now rentals are changing hands less often. This means that the same number of people are competing for fewer spots. Combine that with an increase in demand and already high prices and you have a full blown crisis."

sanfrancisco,3da1ed,eean,4,Wed Jul 15 04:52:02 2015 UTC,"They don't allow anyone to live there if the units are taken off the market, which is worse for everyone. Plus just because that's the goal of rent control doesn't mean that rent control is a good solution to the problem. I wouldn't amputate your foot just because you stubbed a toe. Even if that was the whole point of the amputation!  My point with the original post is more that AirBnb with 350 units is NOTHING. It's like saving a few cents on your monthly budget when there are hundreds of dollars to be saved elsewhere. Unoccupied rent controlled buildings is just one example of better things to focus our efforts on."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,genericactionhero,4,Wed Jul 15 01:40:14 2015 UTC,"That number is from 2011, and the only support given for blaming it on rent control is one person's anecdote."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,MrWakey,5,Tue Jul 14 23:39:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, it is an estimate after all. This more recent article has another estimate between 10,000 and 25,000. But let's just say that the lowest estimate I could find was still 10 times too high. That means that there are still 1,000 units purposely left off the market which is 3 times a greater impact than the 350 from AirBnB.   But AirBnB is still being loudly scapegoated for a problem that existed when it came here and will exist even if we kick it out. There are so many solutions with better potential than 350 units to focus our efforts on."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,genericactionhero,3,Wed Jul 15 01:49:57 2015 UTC,"I think zombie titles should also be pointed out as part of the problem in the suburbs. I live in antioch and there are at least 4 homes with a few blocks of me which have been boarded up for many months, bordering on years. Several have ended up with squatters, another was burned down, all of them sit vacant and unkept.   Apparently they sit because it's not profitable for the bank to take it back despite the tenant having been evicted. The bank stalls in taking over the title so they don't have to pay for the home if the cost of taking over the title is going to be more than they would get in the resulting sale.  This does several things. One, it drives up overall home prices in the area by keeping cheap houses out of the market that are (or were) otherwise sellable. Next, once it becomes profitable for the bank take over the title on the house again, the bank finishes off the 'stalled' paperwork and flips the home then at a profit instead of a loss. One nasty side effect from that is during that time where the bank can stall the paperwork, the original (now evicted) property owner is still on the hook for things like property tax and upkeep despite not being able to live in the property."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,sclarke27,7,Tue Jul 14 22:16:31 2015 UTC,"This is easy to fix.  Craft a tax that makes renting out a whole apartment full-time on airbnb no more profitable than renting to a tenant. Make the tax only applicable to non-resident listings (as in you don't pay the tax if you share your home, only if you would be a landlord but instead chose to list on Airbnb). There are lots of tax schemes that make idle housing you don't live in expensive, and libertarian ""I own it so i can do what the fuck I want with it"" types are welcome to sell, lobby against the tax, put a tenant in that unit to avoid the tax, move into the unit themselves, or shut up and fucking pay the tax because boo-hoo, you're still wealthy enough to have housing you don't even need to live in in one of the most expensive housing markets in the world."

Meanwhile the city is short tens of thousands of housing units and refusing to build any OR address the existing laws allowing our current situation to happen.

sanfrancisco,3da1ed,steady-state,0,Tue Jul 14 21:37:41 2015 UTC,"Again, that is subject, but for me, yes. I have lived in other states and consider my quality of life in the Bay Area to be higher than any other place I have lived. That may change at any moment, and I understand that, too."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,GailaMonster,3,Tue Jul 14 21:39:25 2015 UTC,"Right, but what does that have to do with taxation?   If you look at the places in the world with the highest quality of life for everyone across the board (e.g. Denmark, Norway), they have WAY higher taxes, even than in SF. If you want to live in a place with low taxes (and the infrastructures and opportunities that accompany them), move to:"
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,steady-state,0,Tue Jul 14 22:42:17 2015 UTC,"If we are going to go down that route, I bet the quality of life is better in Switzerland, with a tax rate of about %9 vs %40 in California.  And if I want to pay the same tax rate, might as well move to Canada, where it's identical but I have an even higher quality of life. And I can work in the oil industry as an engineer and make more than those silicon valley people!  Win win!  No love, higher taxes does not mean a better quality of life for everyone."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,somethrowaway39,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:55:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, if you compare the tax rate as a % of GDP, you'll get a much better figure.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDP  Switzerland is higher than the US, because they have much more tourism in relation to their country size, which means they can tax their citizens less (if i had to guess). EU is also in a special place, because any EU member can study abroad at a school for basically no cost, if they desire. Also: move/live/work. they share each other's resources to some extent.  I think that the number of social services offered in a country is a major contributor to ""quality of life,"" which is often necessitated by a higher tax rate--though not to say that a high tax rate necessarily ensures a high quality of life. For example, Mongolia has a higher tax rate than Canada."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,MAGZine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree on that.  It's the efficiency & availability of social services, or just services in general, not the tax rate per say.  You'll also notice that the biggest services with the biggest shortages in the USA have a lot of regulation, monopolies and supply constraints for them, such as college degrees, housing units and medical services..."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,somethrowaway39,15,Thu Jul 16 01:48:06 2015 UTC,"This isn't really a fix. If people have enough wealth and you attempt to add this complex tax compliance scheme, they will simply just let the property stay vacant.

sanfrancisco,3da1ed,SFGetWeird,6,Tue Jul 14 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, I know about rent control. I am an attorney and have done housing cases for some area non-profits. but thanks for assuming that because you disagree with me, i must be ignorant ;) Care to share what rent control factoid I must be unaware of that would change my opinions? What ""random, ignorant comment"" of mine runs contrary to SF's rent control ordinance?  If the units were rent-controlled and went back to being occupied by tenants, they would have rents re-set to market rate. If they were rent-controlled and occupied at the time of purchase, the owner got the same price discount at acquisition that would be contemplated in a sale of an occupied unit. It's on the purchaser to be savvy of that consideration. Don't want to be subject to rent contol and the impact it can have on sale price? don't but an older building. Easy.  Besides, I still don't see any statement in the article stating what percentage of these units are subject to rent control, but I guess you are randomly assuming it's most/all because of the general age of the housing stock."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,GailaMonster,7,Tue Jul 14 19:26:33 2015 UTC,"but I guess you are randomly assuming it's most/all because of the general age of the housing stock.   Then, by virtue, it's not a random assumption. 72%+ of the city's rental units are under rent control. A lot of the newer, high unit rental buildings that aren't explicitly do not allow for any form of short-term rentals. People with rent controlled units have more financial incentive to leave them vacant or Airbnb them than those with non rent controlled units. Seriously, do some research and thinking before posting."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,sfthrow87,7,Tue Jul 14 19:55:17 2015 UTC,"Wow - came back from lunch and /u/sfthrow87 nailed it. The basic most simple premise is this example: I own an apt and I  am afraid of renting it and losing my ability to sell it or use it down the road because of rent control, so I am going to leave it empty. Oh wait, here's a cool new vacation/ST rental service(Air BnB) that is way easier and more popular than the old vacation rentals. I will use that to get SOME income from my property and not risk long term issues. Oh wait, now they are setting this complex tax on it, I will just not rent it again go back to letting my family and friends use it when they visit SF. It's really that simple. For the owner, the benefit he receives from not having to deal with tenants and rent control is worth more to him than the rental income he would receive from tenants."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,SFGetWeird,5,Tue Jul 14 20:37:24 2015 UTC,"Your point is not at all lost with me, and i don't know why you think it is.  I have never argued that the benefit of renting is higher to a landlord than airbnb - in fact, the premise of my argument is that of course it's preferable to have an airbnb guest to a rent-controlled tenant, otherwise how would taxing ""entire unit"" airbnb listings push that incentive back towards tenants?!   My point is I have no sympathy for an owner of a property that was VACANT (and thus only making the landlord money on paper with increased sale value) who then made it an airbnb listing, when they bitch  about a tax levied on that money. They were making 0 before airbnb, they're making a positive amount with Airbnb, and now this HORRIBLE TAX OMG would suddenly cause them to...continue to make a positive amount thru Airbnb.   See? if you were making 0 because you kept it empty, and now you're making money thru airbnb, then unless the tax is 100% of your airbnb revenue, you're still making money. If you thought the value of having tenants was less than 0 (and thus you kept it empty before airbnb), then you will probably pay the tax and still list the property, and I don't have pity for you that your ability to earn money with airbnb is subject to a tax. The world is full of income and transfer taxes.    The landlords were all apparently just sitting on empty property before airbnb and that was fine by them. they're still better off, even after paying a tax, the revenue for which could go to some public good (or- gasp! measures to alleviate the housing crisis).  I would NEVER buy a property subject to SF's rent control. I don't even think rent control has a positive effect on keeping housing prices affordable. It seems MANY of the people disagreeing with me here assumed i had a certain type of broad housing philosophy, when in fact i was only advocating taxing the ""whole listing"" Airbnb hosts, and made no such comments on the merit of rent control, the fiscal prudence of owning investment properties subject to rent control, or whether I want to ""eat the rich"""

Literally no one here is arguing against a general Airbnb tax, such as the hotel tax, or taxes in general. What we are saying is that your proposed tax is extremely narrow, both in scope and mind. It would not be worth it to taxpayers to enforce. It would not fix any problems, and it's uncertain whether there's an actual problem to fix. The fact that you did not consider the rent control implications when positing the consequences of your proposed tax is just further proof it wasn't a well thought out proposition."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,sfthrow87,0,Tue Jul 14 21:12:24 2015 UTC,"You realize that the AirBnB revenue is taxable at both the federal and state levels already right?

You realize that you can deduct your CA taxes on your federal return, right?  You realize that whether something is already taxed, or how much, does not necessarily mean that another tax is imprudent, right?  I completely admit that my argument is ""meh"" in that there aren't nearly enough people doing this (350 units) behavior for a tax on it to make much money or shift much inventory. But your ramblings about taxes don't really form an argument for how this tax is bad in the abstract."

Guess what, if they're already in the highest bracket, then the marginal money they would make from Airbnb would be taxed at around 50%. That additional 20k per year or whatever from Airbnb would end up being 10k after taxes, assuming they're rich and already in the highest bracket. Again, please go read up on marginal analysis."

That the current owner may have purchased the unit at a depressed price because it was still under rent control does not mean that now that it's vacant he will be more willing to re-rent the unit and cause its value to be again depressed.   He was fortunate enough to have the unit become vacant during his time of ownership.

How much would rent decrease due to another up to 350 units being added? Not much at all, as seen in the past few years.   Jealousy is not a reason to impose a tax."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,sfthrow87,4,Tue Jul 14 21:59:46 2015 UTC,"It's a far, far logical leap from ""I think this tax might cost more to enforce than it would take in"" to ""therefore, you're only suggesting this tax because you're jealous."" Your first point is potentially totally legit: it's not worth a tax that is a net cost to enforce. I agree with that point, but I don't think that would be the case here:  Airbnb already handles the hotel tax, so it seems like it would be easy to the same for this suggested tax."

sanfrancisco,3da1ed,sfthrow87,2,Tue Jul 14 22:47:40 2015 UTC,There are other headaches associated with renting. Airbnb means short term rentals.

sanfrancisco,3da1ed,maldovix,2,Tue Jul 14 20:15:58 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't solve the problem for a lot of these 350 units. Given the high market rate rent right now, many of them would probably make more money with a lot less hassle renting to a full-time tenant. But as soon as you do that, you heavily reduce the value of your unit, as it's now occupied by someone under rent control.

If they would be subject to rent control today, they were subject to rent control when the owner bought them. Perhaps the units were occupied when the current owner bought, and that was built into the purchasing price, so i'm not exactly worried about it being built into the sale price.

That is just the type of property that was bought.   And all of that has absolutely nothing to do with the current owner's present decision to sell or not. If his unit is pre 1979, he's going to decide whether to sell for 800k, keep the unit vacant, or start renting and have the value go down to 600k-700k. The price at which he bought it won't really matter unless he's under financial pressure. Please pick up any econ book and learn about marginal analysis if you're confused.   And frankly, as a prospective buyer, i'm ALL ABOUT heavily reducing the value of your unit ;).

That place certainly isn't California, and I have no pity for people who are savvy enough to buy investment property in CA and yet not savvy enough to realize that taxes 1) are a thing and 2) are subject to change and 3) are not cheap in Cali. Just like you hedge your investments against loss, you hedge your tax liability by not dumping all your investment assets into a class that could all be suddenly subject to a huge change in tax liability. You want a low tax liability, buy stocks. Or make a movie. Or seek incentives to build a manufacturing plant someplace.

Lots of people with lots more money than me are way smarter about their investment choices than to buy residential property as an investment in SF and then claim the sky is falling when someone proposes a tax to steer landlords away from Airbnb and towards traditional tenants.

You're really cherry-picking my comments to misrepresent me. That's a dumb way to have a discourse. A person renting out their couch != someone with 10 apartments in SF on Airbnb. the first person is not necessarily rich (though she may be). The second person almost certainly is. You're not honestly too stupid to make this distinction, right? So you are just intentionally avoiding taking note of this obvious divide between Airbnb host types.  I am a home-sharer. I don't consider me renting my couch out to be consuming housing that would otherwise be available to rent. My interests as a home sharing host on Airbnb make perfect sense when paired with my concern over non-resident hosts renting out multiple entire units on the site - it's politically unpopular but the harm is blamed on all hosts."

sanfrancisco,3da1ed,sfthrow87,2,Tue Jul 14 20:24:03 2015 UTC,I would not have a roommate if I didn't use airbnb. So your premise that it would be housing is false.

That is a pretty substantial jump from ""rent controlled tenants are less desirable than non-rent controlled tenants"". You're basically saying the value of a tenant to all property owners of would-be rent-controlled units is less than 0""  Do you honestly, genuinely think they were all vacant? I don't, if only because it's false that 100% of the rent controlled units are vacant now, and because specific examples are easy to find. here is one in Berkeley, and here is another in L.A.   If some were not vacant, then some might go back to traditional tenancies. If all were vacant (which i doubt), than this proposed tax would basically be taking a portion of the windfall of the housing crisis to these hosts, and applying it to a need (housing). In addition to providing incentives, taxes absolutely are designed to re-distribute resources."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,GailaMonster,-2,Tue Jul 14 21:09:14 2015 UTC,"And no one is saying 100% of these units were empty before Airbnb. The article is saying there are only 350 of these full-time units in SF. That is an extremely small number. Proposing a complicated tax to just these in order to free up a percentage of an already small number is not good legislation.    You're basically saying the value of a tenant to all property owners of would-be rent-controlled units is less than 0"" Do you honestly, genuinely think they were all vacant?   Your logic is terrible. This is obviously not true, or nobody would rent out their rent controlled units. Everyone is different. Many of these 350 units are full-time Airbnb rentals because they value short-term non rent controlled rentals over long-term rent controlled rentals, not necessarily because they make more money using Airbnb. There are other factors in the equation which you did not at all realize when you proposed your ""easy fix"". And now, instead of accepting that (despite being someone who keeps a bedroom void of a long-term tenant), you keep trying to defend your ""easy fix"".    If none were vacant, than this proposed    then, not than. I wouldn't point this out for anybody else, but for an attorney, this is regrettable.    In addition to providing incentives, taxes absolutely are designed to re-distribute resources.    Despite your apparent desire for Robin Hood type taxes, this tax would be so narrowly applied that enforcing it would cost the public more than the revenue that it would bring in."
sanfrancisco,3da1ed,sfthrow87,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:22:17 2015 UTC,"Who says these hosts are renting 10 apartments? That's a rather large assumption with no basis in the data presented by the article. Your following invective is equally baseless and irrelevant.   There are reasons against home-sharing, as well. You seem to think you're at this perfect level, where those using Airbnb in other ways are unjust, whereas your method is perfectly just.

sanfrancisco,3da14e,nlcund,4,Tue Jul 14 19:30:28 2015 UTC,"Previously, it was very compelling to say ""people shouldn't have to leave a place just because they get old and retire and go on a fixed income"". However, people are living longer (so there are just more old people going onto a fixed income in need of housing), and we have a protracted housing crisis that is creating some horrible commutes.   At what point does senior housing take a logical backseat to allowing the people with the jobs (who are paying into the social security system) to live anywhere near where they work? How much sense does it make for retirees (who are supported by current workers' payments into the system, and don't usually have to mess with rush-hour commutes if they don't want to) to live near all the places of work, while the workers themselves, who may never GET social security as it currently exists, are saddled with a time- and wallet- draining commute? Ideally there would be enough housing for both, but I would rather see people with brutal commutes see relief if only one is going to happen...

Apparently pre-bailout it cost the auto industry $3000 in healthcare costs to produce a car in America vs $1000 to produce it in Japan. There's other factors, but this definitely plays a role.  The other problem is that up until recently these infrastructure projects have been sporadic at best.

Transplants from a different ethno-cultural background move in and complain about the neighborhood in such a way as to imply an innate connection between Latino culture and crime. Like it or not, there is racial tension in the area directly impacting how people react to local politics. Are they wrong for feeling that way? I don't know. It isn't my neighborhood and to be honest, I have no attachment to the neighborhood aside from St. Francis Creamery (even then, douchey hipsters took it over) but I do understand why people have reservations about the rapidly changing demographic from working class Latinos to upscale whites. I may not agree with them but I have to acknowledge their sentiments and at least attempt to understand where their arguments come. If I'm wrong about anything , I have to welcome corrections or there is no point to dialogue.   The media choosing not to include detailed suspect information has more to do with how useful that information truly is to the public. Oftentimes, calling out the media for not reporting ethnicity is motivated by racism (see Fox News, Stormfront, the comments on SFGate, etc.). Is it really so important that I know a black male weighing between 180 and 230 pounds aged between 25 and 35 commited a crime in an area populated by blacks? Or a Latino male aged 18 to 25 weighing 150 to 190 pounds? These descriptions, despite being detailed, are actual so specific as to be vague. Using them serves little purpose other than to satisfy confirmation bias of racists and reinforce racial ideology.

The TURNOVER of a rent-controlled unit (what this article refers to) only means the unit is no longer 'affordable' based on the current median income and asking rents.

Rent control does NOT create affordable housing. Far from it -- rent control actually diminishes the supply of affordable housing wherever rent control is found. See here:  As an example of the types of problems caused by rent control, Watchdog.org has found that 31,000 rental units in San Francisco are being left vacant by their owners, who prefer to leave them vacant rather than be subject to the restrictions of rent control. From a watchdog.org article:  ""In San Francisco as well, a combination of rent control and strict eviction laws have caused landlords to abandon an estimated 31,000 units— one out of every twelve . When New York City began its rent-stabilization measure in the late 1960’s, it caused New York City landlords to abandon 300,000 units from 1974-1984.""  A study on how rent control drives out affordable housing:  http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-274.html  ANd from Wikipedia:  ""In a 1992 stratified, random survey of 464 economists and economics graduate students in the US, 92.9% generally agreed or agreed with provisions that ""[a] ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available.""[38]  Economic[edit] Most economists believe that a ceiling on rents reduces the quality and quantity of housing available.[38][39] This view is based on analysis of empirical evidence as well as the understanding generated by theoretical models.[40] Economists from differing sides of the political spectrum, such as Paul Krugman[41] and Thomas Sowell,[42] have criticized rent regulation as poor economics which, despite its good intentions, leads to the creation of less housing, raises prices, and increases urban blight.""

sanfrancisco,3d5w0q,Jkid,-2,Tue Jul 14 01:00:37 2015 UTC,"and that's the problem. What's worse we are building a type of housing that is not needed bullshit ""luxury apartments"" where you pay 2,000 for a one bedroom because amenities you don't need or want."
sanfrancisco,3d5w0q,kill-9all,11,Tue Jul 14 01:07:16 2015 UTC,You acknowledge the problem and then just help it continue. We need to build any housing whatever type. The luxury apartments that people move into free up another apartment that tenant would otherwise have rented.   Saying we need to build and then trying to limit the options is exactly why we are in this mess.
sanfrancisco,3d5w0q,argath_thadalfus,6,Tue Jul 14 02:48:34 2015 UTC,"Do you know why those types of housing get built and others don't?   Rent control and related regulations don't magically make property not cost money. When a landlord pays market rate for a property, they need to make a return on investment, or at the very least break even. Rent control and related laws mean that, while they might charge market rate today, if someone moves in and stays there for 20 years, they will be losing money in the long term Strict tenant protection laws mean that one bad apple can ruin a landlord. A landlord might make a tidy profit for a decade, but then get the one tenant with a pet that pees all over everything. Boom, $40,000 repair bill that you can't ever legally get from the tenant. Your last decades' profit from your property just vanished.  (For landlords owning multiple larger properties) There are legal requirements to set aside a certain number of affordable housing units. If your housing development will only break even at $2000/mo/unit rent, but affordable housing means that 15% of your units must be below $1200, that money needs to come from somewhere.  (For landlords owning multiple larger properties) The long bureaucratic process involved in property development in SF means that there is both a large delay, and a large uncertainty, in construction of new housing properties. This substantially drives up the cost of building housing.   In all of these cases, the laws and incentives present in SF have created a situation where landlording is a high-risk business. Not necessarily an unprofitable one, but one with a large uncertainty. One where there is a likelihood of events that wipe out your finances. So how do landlords deal with this? They work in extra margins where they can. As a crude, oversimplified example: if you have to charge BMR rents for 15% of your units, you need to charge above-market rates for the rest to break even.   Except landlords (contrary to popular belief) cannot just arbitrarily raise the rent. If my neighbouring landlord is renting units at $2000/mo, I can't just arbitrarily rent units at $2500/mo; tenants won't rent my house when an identical house is 20% cheaper. Rents rise over time, but they rise together; one individual can't raise the rent on new units on their own.  But they need to raise the rent in order to account for the risk they're taking as a direct result of various well-meaning, poorly-thought-out regulations. So what do they do?  They increase the quality of the housing they build. By building luxury units instead of regular units, they allow themselves to charge a higher rent.  ""But wait.... they charge a higher rent, but it also costs them more. How does this give them the extra profits they need to account for the risk?"". Good question. And the answer is that luxury goods can get away with higher profit margins. If you're a working class family with children, you need to be price conscious; you can't afford to waste money. But if you're already the kind of person who can spend $4000/mo on a luxury condo, you're going to be less careful with your money (since you have a lot of it). An extra $100/mo above market rates will cripple a lower income family, but it's pocket change to a high income professional.   And so, all of these various factors align to motivate landlords to build higher priced, higher-profit-margin housing. Which in turn makes the plight of poor families worse in the short term. Which spurs populist legislation attempting to protect them. Which increases the incentive of landlords to build more expensive housing. It's a vicious cycle caused by bad incentives.   If you want landlords to build cheaper apartments, you need to make it easier to do so. Note that I am not making the supply side argument of ""landlords build expensive housing because they are greedy;if you give them more money they'll build cheaper housing"". That is not the case. But what does need to happen is that risk needs to be taken out of the landlord business. Bad tenant risk. Can't raise rent to cover costs risk. Construction project falls through risk. As long as landlords are in a position where one problem tenant can ruin them (while completely protected from having to take any responsibility for said problems), they will be risk averse, and this manifests as building housing for a higher income tier.   You want more lower- and middle class housing? Do the following:   Make it easier for construction projects to happen. Take uncertainty out of the equation. This means cutting red tape. Keep in mind that most red tape is there for a reason; some people feel strongly that their specific piece of tape is necessary. They will be upset. Ideally, you would pass fast-track legislation like some cities have: so long as a construction project conforms to certain fairly general requirements, it is assumed to be permitted by default, with their permits revoked if they are not up to code Related to this, increase height limits + density. Increase density everywhere, not just in SoMa and the Mission. I'm looking at you, Geary corridor. Increased height limits mean landlords can build more units on a given plot of land. More units allows them to spread out the risk of any one individual unit going bad. It also increases the total stock of housing, driving down rents in the long term per supply/demand. And before you raise the concerns about Manhattanization, consider the following. Everyone loves Victorians. Those nice, 3 storey, 4-8 unit buildings in the Mission. If you (hypothetically) replaced every house in the Richmond and Sunset with a Mission Victorian, you'd double the population density of SF. DOUBLE IT. Without building anything more than 40 feet tall (Which is, btw, the height limit assigned to Port Authority land as per the voter initiative that followed the 8 Washington debacle).  Make it easier to evict problem tenants. I know, eviction is a four-letter word here. It's horrible when hard working families in tenuous positions get their housing taken away. But it's also horrible when you are legally required to allow a problem tenant to keep living in your house. The people who destroy your property, and you can't recoup your costs from them. They are a drag on the whole system and penalize those of us who are honest and responsible renters.  Eliminate or drastically reduce rent control. Rent control is implicitly subsidized by new renters who pay market rates. Rent control does not protect poor people; it protects people who have been here a long time. Rent control prevents landlords from recouping their costs in the long term. Replace it with something targetted more specifically to people who need it."
sanfrancisco,3d5w0q,greatjones,3,Tue Jul 14 18:20:40 2015 UTC,"This is a well put together argument covering many aspects of this complex topic.  One minor point I think you could improve upon is this part:   But if you're already the kind of person who can spend $4000/mo on a luxury condo, you're going to be less careful with your money (since you have a lot of it).   I think they point you are getting at has more to do with wealth elasticity of demand, which is a bit different than not being careful with money."

But what about the middle class with good jobs and the working class who work in the service industry who can't afford these rents now? Eventually, San Francisco will have a bifurcated economy: Wealthy and working poor only, while the middle are forced to commute. And with rising fares and deteriorating services, the middle class may be forced to abandon their careers and forced into low-wage work."
sanfrancisco,3d5w0q,argath_thadalfus,3,Tue Jul 14 20:48:33 2015 UTC,"But what about the middle class with good jobs and the working class who work in the service industry who can't afford these rents now?    Honestly, it sucks to be them. This problem has been created over 40 years, it won't be solved over 4 months. There will be massive instability before it's over.   The current policy of the city seems to be to deny that this is happening at all, punt as much as it can forward, and let the people get extremely fucked eventually. I'd rather set up systems to help them through the unstable transition period. I don't know what that looks like.   In the extremely short term, there is nothing we can do. Lots of people will get hurt, but that's what happens when you let problems fester for so long.   In the regular short term (think on the order of years), the only viable solution is to move to cheaper areas. This isn't really viable right now though; short of certain specific locations (mostly BART stops), SF is inaccessible to most people. This could be made to work, in a pinch, by dramatically increasing transit service to suburbs. This is a chicken-and-egg problem though; this investment won't be made until people already move, and as long as we are committed to keeping those low- and middle-income households within these 49 square miles, people won't be moving.     That said, I take exception with several of your implications.    But what about the middle class with good jobs and the working class who work in the service industry who can't afford these rents now?    Most of the tech workers I know can't afford these rents now. That's why they live with roommates. I don't think it's reasonable to complain that middle class people can't afford their own places, but then not care when the people you accuse of being richer then them also can't afford it.    Eventually, San Francisco will have a bifurcated economy: Wealthy and working poor only, while the middle are forced to commute.    Yes. Yes it will. That's kind of my point. It's been on this trajectory for a long, long time.   That said, I also think this is disingenuous. This is how it is in most of the world. This is how it is in New York; poor and middle class people don't live in Manhattan, but they still work there. This is how it is in most European cities.   It also hypothesizes the San Francisco city limits as a barrier that it is unacceptable to cross. That's an unreasonable expectation. For comparison, look at this image. This is my home city superimposed on San Francisco. My home city is approximately the same population as San Francisco. The ""middle class"" live at the border edges and commute to downtown.   Bear with me for a second for a thought experiment. What if San Francisco amalgamated nearby land. What if the bay area wasn't 101 cities, but was just a handful. What if everything within the bounds I drew on that map was San Francisco, instead of Other Cities. Would people be so upset that you had to move to the outer parts of SF to afford to live there? I don't think they would, on the grounds that nobody is upset that they have to live in the avenues to afford it here, and that's conceptually the same thing.   San Francisco is really really small and it's not reasonable to expect to be able to have millions of people within walking distance of the FiDi.   I assume that the first thing people are going to say in response to this is ""yeah, well, the cities you talk about have better transit"". First, the city I'm from has near-nonexistent transit. But that's a fair argument; NYC's subway is lightyears ahead of ours. I see this as falling under the umbrella of ""40 years in the making"". BART is insufficient for this area. It has been insufficient for a long time. And ultimately, that's on the voters of the Bay Area; I only moved here 3 years ago, and I'm an immigrant so I can't vote anyway.   And with rising fares and deteriorating services, the middle class may be forced to abandon their careers and forced into low-wage work.   That doesn't make sense to me, and I'm hoping you could clarify it. What are you using as definitions of 'lower class' and 'middle class'? The Mayor of San Francisco defines the middle class here as $80,000-$150,000/yr household income, and the median household income is $73,000. ""Median"" seems a reasonable threshold for middle class, since it is the literal middle. For lower class? Full time minimum wage is probably a reasonable guess, that averages over the lows of part time workers, and the highs of multiple earners per family, tipped staff, and people with seniority who make more than minimum wage. That's $15/hr * 2000hrs => $30,000/yr. Do you really believe that rising fares (I assume you mean transit) and deteriorating services (not sure exactly what you're referring to) would motivate people to more than halve their income while increasing their rent? That doesn't add up to me.   Additionally (and this is a little more hypothetical and optimistic, but it's also kindasorta born out by history), if you had middle income earners quitting their salaried jobs to take minimum wage service jobs in SF, all of those middle income employers won't just disappear. They still have viable businesses, serving real needs that real people pay for. It is much more likely, if such a thing would happen, that the employers would follow them and they would be able to maintain their incomes. I can't prove this (that's why it's hypothetical), but for example, this is literally what tech companies have done. Tech companies all put their HQs in the south bay, where land was cheap. But for various reasons, their employees opted to live in SF. Said tech companies opened SF offices, so their employees wouldn't quit. I see no reason why other companies would not do the same, if they were faced between doing this or going out of business."
sanfrancisco,3d5w0q,Murica4Eva,5,Tue Jul 14 23:44:59 2015 UTC,"The point isn't to build housing specifically for anyone in particular. The point is simply to build housing.

I understand why this bothers you, but that has nothing to do with the price of tea in China.  If you are worried about the middle class, you will be pro development at all levels. If you're not, you're simply part of the problem. Luxury housing directly benefits the middle and working classes. It's not bullshit and it is necessary. It's not some 'yes, but' situation.

This is like the world's simplest and most easily fixable problem with extremely apparent policy causes, and is flat out easy to fix. The issue is that your judgments are clouded by your anti-tech, anti-development attitude. Be pro-developer and watch rents decrease, or see the middle class disappear. You have two options.

They pay 1/3rd-1/4th what I pay, because they've been in the city for 10 years. They neither need nor deserve the benefits of rent control, and every dollar of subsidy towards their rent is a dollar not going to people who desperately need it.

TLDR; the number of non-white tenants increased along with average rents (up 53.7% over 3 years).  According to RealFacts (via), average rent in SF in 2015 was $3458 and in 2012 it was $2663, an increase of 29.9%.  But if instead of comparing the last three years in SF to the immediate aftermath of Boston's rent control phase-out, we look at the same period for both cities (1994--1997) we find that SF rents increased by 52.3%.  So I think it's tough to argue that rent control keeps things affordable generally, although clearly it does benefit incumbent tenants to the detriment of everyone else."

They offer a novel way of getting from one part of the city to another with few stops in between.  Sounds kinda similar to LEAP in that way.    The cable cars are custom designed and built.  Many of the cars were built or rebuilt after the ADA was enacted, however not one cable car is wheelchair accessible.  It therefore seems that  MUNI has intentionally made a decision that wheelchair riders do not fit in with their business model.  People accused LEAP of doing the same thing by not reinstalling the wheelchair ramps they tore out, along with everything else, during the redesign."

sanfrancisco,3d5ism,seablizz,-7,Mon Jul 13 23:07:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting reads.  Thanks.  Though, being exempted does not change the fact that if they really wanted to they would figure out a way to make at least one car wheelchair accessible.    This one car could take reservations so that the wheelchair user wouldn't have to wait for the one car to make it to the terminal they are waiting at.   In general, I just think the exemptions and grandfathers of the ADA is not fair.  If the ADA requires startup transit companies to be 100% compliant from the start, then existing companies should be forced to do the same immediately.  For example, every stop of the L-Taraval should immediately have a ramp constructed for wheelchair access."

Its basically an airport shuttle style van with lots of pick up times and route flexibility. Since Leap only had a handful of those fancy busses, their routes were pretty limited. Chariot is basically a cheap alternative to taking the bus, lyft line, or uber pool. I think their biggest competition is people taking uber or lyft instead.

And any group that is %70 to %60 white is just reflecting the general population percentage of the USA.  It's really asians who are 'over-represented' in these numbers, not whites.  Asians are something ~%5 of the us population, but represent %30-%40 of most tech companies!  But you would also see this 'imbalance' in most ivy league schools if they didn't actively discriminate against asians in admissions."

How about we flip it around and start asking things like ""why aren't there more Asians in other industries, like finance?""

Presumably the hope is that the tech industry won't fight back as hard as Wall Street did (or at all).  If you have any doubts that it's some of the same people, do some searches on people like Max Bell Alper (the fake Google employee from the bus protest) or Erin McElroy (from the eviction mapping project). They have histories with Occupy movements. The specific complaints don't need to be the same in every case for there to still be a pattern.

Getting a degree is not nearly enough, you have to know what the hell you are doing.   You don't need to train to be a cube monkey to get into the industry, I jumped over from a pure academic background due to the marketable programming and hardware skills I developed in that field. If you encourage people to learn science, math, engineering, electronics, and programming as useful tools for everyday life (which they are IMHO) you will have more people choosing that as a vocation and others that will introduce those tools to their profession of choosing (reducing the ""cloister"" effect of tech) as it stands now you either are exposed to it form a young age due to higher SES of white and asian communities or you enter way behind the rest of your classmates and fight to catch up in college.

sanfrancisco,3da0ta,GoatLegSF,2,Wed Jul 15 03:07:26 2015 UTC,"They are taking the piss outta something that already took the piss out of regular skateboards. Longboards are bad enough; they aren't agile in the slightest, can't jump up and down and over things, have a design tailored to downhill skating (great for wide turns, carving, going fast), generally aren't suited to regular street riding. These electric boards make it one step simpler with motor power, but would be completely horrible at doing what an ""analog"" longboard is good at. It's simple step to tread backward from where 95% of longboards are being used; one need only get a pool board, that is to say, get an 8 1/4 board, throw on some risers, fat/soft wheels, and if you're into it, some wide trucks. The. You'd have an agile board that you can kick fast as fuck, roll over every crack, and if you need to, Ollie up the occasional curb, over potholes, manhole covers, whatever. If you want to sit atop a motor, be agile and 100% street legal, just get a fucking moped and be done with it."

Sure, they could hire a property management company to rent it out, but I suspect that many of these investors are content with capital appreciation and don't want the extra hassle of renting out their properties.  As an interesting aside, pre-2010, China had a negative real interest rate which effectively meant if you kept money in the bank (or even in a conservative stock/bond portfolio), the value of your money would decline more than your return. Conversely, it was quite advantageous to borrow money because you would effectively owe less than what you borrowed. During this time, Chinese money flowed into international real estate like mad. Since property value is inherently deflationary (i.e. they're not making any more land), the best investment you could make with your Chinese money was in property. It's no longer the case that China has a negative real interest rate, but other market fluctuations could case a similar outcome."

sanfrancisco,3cuou9,SFLadyGaga,8,Sat Jul 11 01:10:02 2015 UTC,"Because, bad and all as some Muni drivers are, the balance of probability is that the door was opened in front of the bus."

sanfrancisco,3cuou9,openzeus,6,Sat Jul 11 02:59:19 2015 UTC,"The real problem with self-driving buses in cities is they will be programmed to be extremely risk-averse. Pedestrians and cyclists will be safe to just about totally ignore them, to the detriment of everyone on the bus reaching their destination on time. Human bus drivers, on the other hand, can take more 'risks' (as they would be identified by AI) since they exercise individual discretion with their actions and 99 out of 100 times no one is hurt. People will get out of the way of an angry, honking (possibly crazy/incompetent) bus driver where they'd ignore a patient, 100% consistently risk-averse robot. Self-driving technology works best in driving environments where pedestrians are prohibited, like highways and subway systems."

I mean if I had a bike that was worth practically nothing, I would lock it up on the street only if I needed to. So I wouldn't really care if someone jacked it (and it would be so basic, hopefully most would not bother). I could just go buy another one when I need it.  But if I had a bike that had any sort of value, I just wouldn't even bother trying to lock it at any public space in SF.

sanfrancisco,3cr9ug,instant_michael,3,Fri Jul 10 15:14:36 2015 UTC,Like everyone has already said it really depends on the location....What type of sun the area gets and the soil.  Things like tomatoes and lemons need a lot of sun!
sanfrancisco,3cr9ug,yuckyuck12,3,Fri Jul 10 15:16:16 2015 UTC,"Take this to a garden forum for better responses, but I 've had great success in the last 10 years since I started with...  Anything leafy/green will grow pretty easily, artichoke for sure, potatoes, carrots, strawberries, beets are really easy, mushrooms are inoculated all over my garden with different sport types on different woods and mulches, rosemary,mints, green beans, onions, garlic, green onions are pretty easy.  Bigger items like squash, tomatoes, etc  typically need more sun, at least 5-6 hours of direct lite to get to good size. So if you want to do tomatoes, go for the cherry type. Peppers, smaller ones. loquat tree for a rare fruit that will never be at whole paycheck, asparagus.  There are much more, go experiment     Pro tip: Raised beds are better but cost some cash to make. If you direct sow, use a layer of cardboard, straw, then some new top soil an inch or two make a sandwhich. wet cardboard/soil before planting, make hole where you want to plant in cardboard. Total weed suppressant and conserves water. It can look really good. Wood chips too for the win.  Look here for what I mean. https://www.google.com/search?q=cardboard+layer+solid&safe=off&biw=1272&bih=626&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=hOmfVdeuHIT1oATk06CYBg&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg#safe=off&tbm=isch&q=cardboard+layer+soil  I will also add, just do it, go have fun and start small, something you can manage and each year you gain knowledge. A lot of people start out with all sorts of veggies and realize it's a lot of work to keep the garden healthy.   Secondly, as you are aware, water is an issue. I do all sorts of techniques to collect grey water and recycle it into my 40 gallon drip system. Try to conserve water, this is why wood chips are really good for gardens.  Without spending too much money, go find 4 cut trees, make a naturally raised bed and you will see a little habitat grow for all sorts of food systems. Try to create a bio diverse area even with your small garden. Have things in a state of decomposition, always, you get ""good"" bugs eating the ""bad"" bugs. Good luck."

I put a raised bed in my section instead of digging into the soil because I'm lazy. Here's what it looked like last Sunday, and I started in mid-May. I've been getting lots of greens (lettuce and bok choy), summer squash, and sugar snap peas so far, with lots of tomatoes growing too. My roomies just planted straight into the dirt after adding a couple bags of compost, and they're seeing good progress on tomatoes, summer squash, spinach, eggplant, and cucumber. Beans, peppers, and beets on the other hand didn't do so well, probably because it's a bit cold for them.  I recommend going to a garden center and picking out some tomato starts (cherry tomatoes do really well in our climate) and a couple packets of lettuce and spinach seeds.

Instead, because of the voting system, all but one particularly vocal minority of newcomers are being effectively chased away.   At times reddit can be a cruel mistress, but the up/down voting is part of its soul.   Downvotes have chased away a few I've introduced to the site. Ultimately I feel it's good to toughen the skin a bit. Like learning to take constructive criticism on English papers in college without feeling attacked personally.

Bacon is wonderful but not part of a pure burger.  I like my burgers without cheese, so I get it with everything standard.  IMO a burger is judged by:   The patty: Is it flavorful (correctly salted) and juicy (correctly cooked and made from fatty enough--but not too fatty--cuts of quality beef?) (70% of score) The bun: Is it soft yet with a bit of chew, and can it stand up to the burger without becoming soggy or falling apart?  (20% of score) The toppings: Are they fresh?  Does the restaurant offer all of the standard toppings (no homemade ketchup--always Heinz, mayo, mustard, pickles, onions, lettuce, tomato)? (10% of score)   How would you score? :)"

I'd say they were just being polite, but the look on their faces after they choke down that first bite of beefy splendor reveals their honesty when they say to me, ""that was the best fucking burger I've ever had."""

sanfrancisco,3covil,melancolor,13,Thu Jul 9 16:45:38 2015 UTC,Yeah the light heartedness of the article is weird.  These people were shooting at a couple in their 70's.  To the shooters it may not seem like a big deal but it is highly likely one or both of these people were on blood thinners which would have meant severe bruising and possible dangerous bleeding.  The stress of being shot could have easily triggered a cardiac event.    Not to mention the damage to someone's vision when one of these paint balls invariably ends up striking someone in the eye.

Brinklow seem to share; that people being gunned down in the streets isn't a big deal unless it's by actual bullets.   It is known that paintball rounds hurt. There are people in this very thread attesting to how such attacks can be damaging physically as well as psychologically.    The shooters know of the pain they cause.  They know, and they are going around and hurting others, attacking those who are most vulnerable, for fun.    If you aren't upset about that, what the fuck do you care about?"

I never said they shouldn't try to catch and prosecute these jokers.  However, to me when you compare it to murder and rape and things like that, it does have a much more light-hearted tone.  As far as I know, nobody has ever been killed by a paintball and honestly it really doesn't hurt that bad. The time I stubbed my toe yesterday hurt more than any time I've gotten hit by a paintball.

The first thing that comes to mind would be the recent Embarcadero shooting I guess.  I've never really been attacked by a stranger before and have always made the assumption that that type of violent crime happens to people involved in some sort of crime to begin with eg. a drug deal gone bad.  The fact that my gf and I frequent the area, sometimes late at night is disturbing.  Bullets kill, paintballs don't."
sanfrancisco,3covil,melancolor,0,Fri Jul 10 22:21:31 2015 UTC,"You see, I do understand that paintball hits aren't likely lethal.  What has been bothering me from the start is the fact that it is battery. It's not a marshmallow shooter or a bubble blaster; it leaves a mark.    A couple of the victims were in their 70's.  As we age, our skin thins and we become far more fragile.  I feel like the fact that the shooter(s) chose such easy and especially vulnerable targets makes the attacks even more disturbing...   Imagine you and your lady are strolling down the Embarcadero.  Early in the evening, there is a slight breeze, and the city lights are just beginning to glow bright in the dusk.  A sedan slows down and pulls up next to the two of you, but you hardly notice. The atmosphere is wonderful and you're both so happy to be alive. But the back window rolls down and the barrel comes out.  You hear the pops and and as you're pelted, your breath is taken away from you. Fight or flight kicks in, but the car speeds away and before you even really register what is happening.  You have no recourse. Your girlfriend's dress is ruined, the night is ruined, and neither of you can stop shaking.   I get that you're not a fan of my melodrama, and  either of us could probably type up an alternative anecdote about how you guys get hit and it doesn't hurt so much, and you both laugh and keep your paint-splattered shirts as souvenirs.   But pain is subjective.  Everyone has walked a different path in life, and things affect us differently based on our past experiences. People deserve peace and respect to their bodies and space; that's why battery is a crime."

You also have a Sheriff whose department kicked the guy loose even after he was asked to be withheld.  Clearly there's a total lack of responsibility from the people who are supposed to protect us.

[Also, the $470k/unit number assumes that these units are only 640 sqft., I'm not sure what the sqft of these units actually are, but it's likely much more.

If this is how the city plans to spend the housing bond money, it's really going to have zero impact.

sanfrancisco,3cnlgw,greatjones,5,Thu Jul 9 08:21:48 2015 UTC,"Transcript - The center of gravity of the global economy is actually shifting east and south to some extent. In fact what’s interesting about that is that if you actually tried to do a center of gravity analysis you’ll actually find that the center of gravity of the global economy by 2025 will actually be somewhere in East Asia is where it will be. And what’s interesting about that is that that’s where it was in about year 1 A.D. So in fact in some ways it’s a return back to where the center of gravity used to be. So you’ve got that big geographic shift happening. Associated with that same geographic shift is actually another shift which is in some ways even more interesting which is the rise in importance of cities and urbanization. I think for the first time we’re going to see the majority of humanity live in cities in ways that are way more profound than we’ve ever seen before. In fact if you actually look at the global economy through the lens of cities you see a few different things. One you see that, for example, between now and the year 2025 something like two-thirds of the global economy and the growth of the global economy is going to be led by about 600 cities. And that’s a very finite number. I mean 600 cities in the grand scheme of things is not a very large number. And of those 600 cities something like 440 of them are actually in emerging countries.  Most people haven’t heard of cities like Komatsu, Tianjin, Honshu. So there’s a lot of cities on that list in the global economy that are quite extraordinary. And by the way this rise in urbanization is interesting because, you know, we’ve actually been adding something the equivalent of if you like six Chicagos every year to the global economy, to just the sheer scale of this urbanization trend. We know that people are wealthier on average when they move into cities. We know that cities as economic engines are actually more productive because of that density. We also know now as a result also of other things like technology that some of the most interesting innovations and business models and models are actually happening inside cities. So it’s no surprise that the vast majority of some of the trends we’re seeing whether it’s the Ubers or the Airbnbs and all these kinds of new interesting models all happen in dense urban environments. So cities are actually very interesting places and I think we haven’t thought enough about them as sort of engines of economic growth and performance."

Cats do have really sensitive noses and will be affected by bear spray. There has been cases where people were able to fend off mountain lions with bear spray, but the trick is to know you were about to be eaten by the cat and have time to pull the bear spray out..."

The Navigation Center is near the 16th Street BART Station in the Mission District. The city is running the Navigation Center in conjunction with the San Francisco Interfaith Council as a pilot project with the goal of creating an efficient path from the street to housing. Episcopal Community Services is providing support, such as counseling and case management. Since it opened 2½ months ago, the Navigation Center has gotten 35 people into housing. Organizers hope the original donor will renew the $3M pledge. The property the shelter is on will start being developed into affordable housing by 2017."

sanfrancisco,3cgn4h,emiterusaemskcolc,12,Tue Jul 7 20:02:06 2015 UTC,"So there are three ECS buildings in that area: Canon Kip Senior Center, Canon Barcus Community House, and Sanctuary Shelter.   Canon Kip is on the SW corner of Natoma and 8th, and there are frequently a good number of people milling around near the entrance doing various things ranging from relaxing and listening to the radio or smoking crack.  Canon Barcus is on the NE corner of Natoma and 8th, and has a lot of family housing. Occasionally people hang out outside, but I think the proximity to the nearby school and family atmosphere have driven most of the undesirable activity elsewhere.  Sanctuary Shelter is down on Howard and 8th. This location is the most variable and as far as I can tell, the shorter term housing option that ECS provides. Sanctuary is a lot like Next Door Shelter in the TL. There's all manner of people coming and going from here: some are polite and quiet, some have dangerous mental disorders. You're just as likely to get a friendly ""hello"" as you are to get spat at by a crackhead.  Truthfully, that area is getting gentrified pretty hard and pretty fast. Old crackhouses on Natoma are getting torn down and replaced with new buildings (no rent control). There's no shortage of young money unafraid of a few tweakers willing to move in.

Here's the only thing the $3M should have been used for:   Toilets Showers   Build a bunch of those wonderful Lava Mae vans or public toilets in critical areas around SoMa and the Mission and reduce human waste, feces, and urine on the street and you will engender more respect and care from the people.  And before you respond, yes this is a short term solution but the payoff will mean larger measures and donations might come from people who are less ""pissed"" off about the state of affairs."

Tech doesn't need to impress the city, it already brings in money to the local economy via the spending power of tech workers.   San Francisco is the center of innovation in the world right now because of tech.  The shit that tech does here is shaping the way we will live in the future in a way no other industry is.   Yes, the side effects of an influx of highly paid individuals deserves discussion but hot damn if it's not exciting right now to be in the center of our version of the gold rush."

Plus, when you kick out natives to make space for condos, which is happening everyday, the people that move into those spaces are not other natives or minorities or middle class or small businesses, they are the privelidged that are pulling in 100K+. The only way to fight that is not by encouraging more bland, lifeless condos, but rather through regulation.

This is a pretty simple problem. People want to live here. Yes, if you build expensive stuff people will want to buy it...the market is demanding expensive stuff because the city has made it impossible to build.   The point isn't to build housing specifically for anyone in particular. The point is simply to build housing. Case in point, I live in a cool place near 24th and Mission in a unit that certainly was filled by a local until I moved here. The installed little altar space for a Maria statue makes that point to me. I, on the other hand, would have been happy to live in, and pay more for, a soulless apt somewhere near a Caltrain station. Housing is an entirely fungible commodity. I am going to live here either way.  This is an interesting model looking at it in a reasonable way. http://sfbarf.tumblr.com/post/123336484965/how-does-adding-expensive-housing-help-the-little  I don't want natives to leave, but I am going to live here. And you can't petrify this city in time. Urban populations are growing nationally, city living is becoming more popular. Suburban flight was the exception to human history, not the rule. Yes, the population will increase, and yes, change will occur....but large cities do tend to have culture too.....Tokyo or NYC or Rome or London or Paris or whatever.  Personally, I think the city would be better with 40k more housing units and all the natives still here along with the newcomers who want to live here as well, but you want to prevent development....well, at least the results are fascinating from an economic perspective."

But it's not really about helping as many people as possible. It's about serving the delusional fantasy held by progressives and the social service set that the homeless are a shave and stable address from having jobs downtown. (They probably don't have a real clear idea about what getting and holding a job involves, to be fair.)  Actually, I'm pretty sure they don't really believe that. It's more about, what's the point of housing people if you don't get the benefit of having them as reliable voting base for years to come. So if that can only benefit a relative few while the rest have to remain scraping by in the street gutters, so be it. An inhumane waste of resource."

SF has arguably the toughest gun laws in the nation, and yet this still happened. It also has the slackest sanctuary city laws, when, in 2013, Mirkarimi made it official policy to only obey ICE detainers for those arrested or convicted of violent felonies - unlike the other sanctuary cities that would have actually handed Lopez-Sanchez over to ICE.   This article is purely trying to protect progressive policy by misplacing blame."

California state law expressly permits municipalities to ignore civil detainers from ICE.  If ICE wants someone deported badly, they can go through due process and get a criminal warrant which would then be honored even by San Francisco.  Let's go through the cities though.   South Tuscon - 'STPD shall not detain a person solely on the basis of an ICE detainer that is not supported by probable cause*' Alameda - released all inmates being held only on civil ICE detainers last year LAPD - allows for ""discretion"" especially for misdemeanor crimes. LA Sheriff's dept - The LASD is not detaining inmates based on ICE issued civil warrants... Inmates with valid detainers will be released. Washington DC - ignores detainers for non-dangerous crimes Cook County - Cook County sheriff claims that detainers cost the county $43k/day and are not reimbursed by ICE.  Cook County Sheriffs dept ignores detainers unless there is a criminal warrant. Orleans Parish, LA - ""The Sheriff's Office shall decline all voluntary ICE detainer requests except if an individual is charged with first degree murder, second degree murder, aggravated rape, aggravated kidnapping, or armed robbery involving a firearm.""   Those are just some of the policies with hyperlinks.  San Francisco's interpretation is hardly extreme in comparison."
sanfrancisco,3chm0m,ihatemovingparts,2,Wed Jul 8 01:51:25 2015 UTC,"Cook County actually complies if ICE offers to reimburse for the particular detainer:   The Sheriff of Cook County shall decline ICE detainer requests unless there is a written agreement with the federal government by which all costs incurred by Cook County in complying with the ICE detainer shall be reimbursed.    DC:   Washington DC - ignores detainers for non-dangerous crimes   No, their policy is not to ignore, it's to exercise discretion - unlike SF, which is a blanket ban.    LAPD - allows for ""discretion"" especially for misdemeanor crimes.   They're willing to turn over for even misdemeanors - this is far more lax than SF.   Let's look at LA Sheriff's dept:   LA Sheriff's dept - The LASD is not detaining inmates based on ICE issued civil warrants... Inmates with valid detainers will be released.   Why did you leave the rest out? Here's what it really reads:   The LASD is not detaining inmates based on ICE issued civil warrants, nor are we detaining inmates up to 48 hours beyond their release date in order to facilitate transfer to ICE custody. Inmates with valid detainers will be released through our regular release process; however, ICE may take those inmates with valid detainers into their custody during this processing time. The LASD will not be detaining inmates any longer than is required to process their release.    That gives ICE the opportunity to take them during processing time, unlike SF. This is extremely different from SF not giving ICE any opportunity whatsoever. Why did you leave this part out? You even inserted a period mid-sentence in your quote."

After talking with each one, I realized they didn't understand at all how the economics of housing worked and that they would never be convinced that in order to lower prices we needed a flat policy like the following:  1)  Uniformly raise density throughout the mission.    2)  Require all new development to have 30% affordable housing units.   3)  Remove all NIMBY power so that a nice mix of affordable, middle class and even luxury units get built.  (luxury units are great because they keep people who want nice places from having to buy 5 unit houses and convert them to a single unit!)  After talking to the people who wanted me to sign the petition I realized that we will never get affordable housing built until all of the people who want to restrict housing are forced to leave the mission due to rising prices.  I am now fully in favor of the moratorium.  The faster the neighborhood is gentrified, the easier it will be to get rid of people like Campos and bring the neighborhood construction policies where they need to be to benefit everyone.    Hopefully we can get back to building in the next 10 years and bring in a new group of affordable housing for future generations, but I'm confident that the Mission has lost its affordable housing for this generation."

I'd still prefer the moratorium doesn't pass,  but if it does it will accelerate the ""changing of the guard"" and we'll get a younger demographic faster,  which will generally vote in favor of density."
sanfrancisco,3chlhl,maldovix,2,Wed Jul 8 15:44:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I had my way, we would preserve 24th street, Mission street and Valencia street's density, and increase the density on all other blocks.  In addition to what I said above, I would also encourage small retail space be required in buildings that are being constructed with over 8 units so that small, mom and pop retailers can continue doing business in the mission.  (small sq ft retail is important because most big chains and proven concepts require more sq footage so restricting development to small retail footprints helps create more mom and pop businesses)."

sanfrancisco,3chlhl,kill-9all,3,Thu Jul 9 01:15:10 2015 UTC,"Kind of, the important thing is that if you flatten what is required so it is known, the cost of building affordable housing units simply reduces the land value.

It is suffering from a lack of market rate housing that is distorting the market to all fucking hell up and down the line. Advocating we build 30% affordable housing is just one more insane anti-development law that will continue the crisis we are dealing with right now, drives up the cost on construction, and dramatically increases the cost to produce units and thus the rents those units must command to be worth building.   If we want to fix this, require developers to build an additional 30% market rate houses in another area. But don't advocate for unrelated social policies when addressing the city's real issue. Having a few more lottery winners does nothing to help us."
sanfrancisco,3chlhl,Murica4Eva,2,Wed Jul 8 17:25:52 2015 UTC,"When I am talking about affordable housing, I am not talking about rent control, I am talking about programs like the LIHTC program.    30% may be too high, but every community in the US has an affordable housing policy and SF should have one too.  Sometimes affordable housing doesn't mean extremely cheap rents.  It would be reasonable for example to have subsidized 1 bedroom rents for people making less than $90k to rent at $1,500.  It may be somewhat of a lottery, but it preserves the middle class."
sanfrancisco,3chlhl,citronauts,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:33:12 2015 UTC,"You're generally right but I have an issue with #2.  I don't think that using tax money to make housing artificially cheap helps anyone in the long run.  I am basing this on some things I believe, so please let me know if I'm wrong:   If you buy a BMR unit, you can not sell it for more than you bought it for, so you aren't building personal wealth. Because BMR units can't gain value, no one takes care of them, so they go downhill quickly and are never updated. But BMR units will still somehow end up on Airbnb and in illegal market-rate subletting situations.   Am I wrong?"

What metrics do you think we should use to determine whether housing units can be added in a particular place?"
sanfrancisco,3chlhl,citronauts,6,Wed Jul 8 00:43:21 2015 UTC,"The moratorium is proposed because of the lack of a strategy for meeting the housing shortage.

They will simply go to other markets."

If you want to solve the crisis, empower developers, else you are a part of the real problem. There no ""strategy"" needed, market forces will allocate resources.

sanfrancisco,3chlhl,quaxon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:18:35 2015 UTC,This is exactly correct. The status quo in San Francisco is to demonize market rate housing. The truly radical thing to do would be to build lots more housing at any and all price levels. Anything else is just more of the same failed policy.
sanfrancisco,3chlhl,quaxon,0,Thu Jul 9 01:54:42 2015 UTC,"I definitely think SF needs tho build more housing, but it needs to be smart about it and not just sell off all of it's assets to shady developers who want to turn everything into tacky looking luxury condos or expensive cafe's. Personally I have no problem with building tons of high-rises in the Soma, dogpatch, and other under-developed areas, however I would like the culture and charm of historic neighborhoods like the Mission, Haight, North Beach, etc. maintained. What good could come to the Mission if 24th street became just like Valencia? Perhaps a lot of the techie/libertarian transplants don't give a shit, but a big reason I moved to SF was because of it's rich culture, arts, liberal stance, and it was a city that catered to everyone whether they were rich or poor. Now it is becoming a city that only caters to the rich. I would also love to see city government work with neighboring cities to develop more and take the heat off of SF. Also I don't think building any realistic amount of housing is going to bring housing prices down, so currently I'd rather fight against evictions and any laws that threaten rent control until this bubble burst and the majority of the new transplants who didn't give a shit about SF move back home."
sanfrancisco,3chlhl,citronauts,14,Wed Jul 8 01:01:39 2015 UTC,"How confident are you that freezing housing development will preserve the character of the neighborhood, though? In 2014, 75 new units were added to the Mission. You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who believes that the gentrification there is the result of 75 newcomers. So where are these newcomers moving in to? Existing units. Which are rising and rising in rent due to demand. Do you really think neglecting to build new units for them will prevent them from moving in? Or prevent rents from rising?  With a freeze on housing, the Mission, and San Francisco as a whole, risks going the route of Paris - the once bohemian city of artists neglected to add any new units to its city center, and now, only the ultra-wealthy can afford to live there while ethnic minorities and professional artists are confined to the peripherie Banlieues. It happened in North Beach already and now it's happening in the Mission."

I agree that we are not building enough and I definitely want to see more housing being built, it just hurts every time a great venue, bar, or eatery gets closed down for some up-tight fancy place. Personally I would love to see massive housing built over the old industrial buildings in the dog patch and other areas that aren't 'cultural hubs' if you will, while also building tons of affordable housing units which I believe none of the new buildings are doing enough of."

Housing is fungible. I would have happily lived in one of the apartments you don't want to build.   Building affordable housing units is fun social policy, but it doesn't lower rents a nickel. Either we build market rate housing, or we watch rents go up, evictions happen and natives flee. Either way, techies are staying, but we'd prefer to be here ALSO. We are not the ones creating an artificial crisis in a ridiculous attempt to petrify a city in time.  I am going to live here either way. We can either build homes, or the Mission can continue to put itself into an economic straight jacket.  There is an answer, and it is build market rate housing, period. If you have another policy, you are part of the driving force behind rent increases. You can vote for the moratorium, but you'll get to watch Mission residents leave their homes in doing so."

sanfrancisco,3ce28d,funkyloki,10,Tue Jul 7 05:11:50 2015 UTC,Didn't realize I was engaging a known troll
sanfrancisco,3ce28d,laughingcurve,7,Tue Jul 7 06:03:51 2015 UTC,"There are more people in favor of AirBnB than libertarians -- my own story lends itself to that. I moved cross-country to the Bay two months ago for a great career break without any kind of real savings. Bringing my medium-sized lab along wasn't a help either. If it weren't for me being able to find an AirBnB far in advance that could accommodate me for a couple of months, it would've been completely hopeless...  Or my company would have had to pay me more, eat away at taxable profits and cause me to further inflate the market with a higher salary. Or they could have put me into corporate housing, costing more (see taxable profits) which are spaces that are exclusively rent-seeking properties rather than things like split-level homes which can hold an extra party.  AirBnB exists because there is a serious issue at hand. AirBnB is not the cause it's just a symptom. The housing stock is far under where it needs to be for the amount of people in the Bay. Lack of housing and market pressures are driving the rates sky high. Prices which only motivates more and more people to buy up spaces for rent or relocating population to hold onto their property and rent it out through property management instead of selling it.   There are really a lot of important fiscal policy levers that can be used, but all economic actions draw reactions, often unforeseen. Price ceilings and floors create artificial imbalances, and while sometimes prudent or needed, other times can make the problem worse. For SF it is both saving elderly and low-income tenants from eviction while at the same time definitely causing people to stay put in their current spaces to avoid market rates -- can't blame them, the lack of housing stock combined with new jobs means a clusterfuck. No one is being served well here either.  The fact is that as long as development and the urban inversion continues, these parcels of land (note, not the building) will become worth more and more. Rent control can only hold the bursting dam for so long. Before it breaks, the city needs to find a way to help it's citizens by making housing affordable. Sure more housing units are important, but things like expanding and improving transit means that lower-income families can live further out from an urban center while still being able to commute in for work. Frankly everyone caught in this mess (aside from some particularly vicious fucking landlords I've read about) seems to instead be undergoing major growth pains from macroeconomic forces way beyond any one local government or citizen's group.  If your rejoinder to all this is a snarky 'Well we don't want you here anyway!' then what on earth do you expect people to do with a position like that? I can understand wanting to find a solution that is pluralistic, but  'Nothing should change, new people should be barred entry, keep everything how I like it!' That's no liberal I know. San Francisco was the place I dreamed about living, and while you may not know me, I am the kind of person you want living here. It's not just about fitting in culturally, it's about what myself and many like me intend to do in order to give back to our chosen home.  AirBnb, tech and new people aren't the problem... it's housing. Your homelessness problem is out of control and getting rid of rental services isn't going to put them in a safe place with their own bed to sleep on. It kills me every day to see it. I did not grow up in an urban area, and I am sad that I have had to learn to deaden myself to mental illness and poverty I see daily.  While I understand that a popular vote probably will succeed, simply because it was passed by ballot does not make it either effective, moral or virtuous. AirBnB saved me and allowed me to move here to join a community, be productive, and build a life. I took a good long while to articulate my thoughts, I sincerely hope you can at least understand and feel things out from my perspective."
sanfrancisco,3ce28d,laughingcurve,9,Tue Jul 7 07:37:16 2015 UTC,"The initiative proposes a law with a 75-day limit on hosting, quarterly data reports from platforms and an ability to go to civil court if the planning department does not react to complaints in time.    This regulation basically just wants to put a maximum stay at 75 days. AirBnB isn't going anywhere."
sanfrancisco,3ce28d,bunnymeee,2,Tue Jul 7 13:59:59 2015 UTC,"75 days   Which is less than I actually signed up for -- 3 months/95 days. Heck, three months was totally under-selling what I really needed considering how it's been a brutal slog trying to find a permanent spot. One month left, and I still haven't been able to put pen to paper. It's not me, my credit, my salary or (totally) my dog's fault -- there's just too much demand that pushes me out from listings."
sanfrancisco,3ce28d,laughingcurve,4,Tue Jul 7 15:08:51 2015 UTC,"The AirBnB regulations are only on short term rentals - those under 30 days. Your situation, 3months/95days, is legal now and would be legal after the regulations as well. At 30 days, you are considered a tenant.  Edit: the regulations limit the sum of the rentals < 30-continuous-days to 75 days per year."
sanfrancisco,3ce28d,lithophore,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:54:01 2015 UTC,Isn't this a risk for the owner? Doesn't it become difficult to remove someone if they are a tenant?
sanfrancisco,3ce28d,VROF,2,Tue Jul 7 07:59:58 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's a risk for the owner. If you pay rent and occupy a space for 30 days, you gain tenancy and all the rights that entails. So, in theory, a tenant could refuse to leave after 30days and force the landlord to evict them. If they continue to pay rent, then the landlord would have to go through something like an owner move in eviction or an Ellis Act eviction. If they don't pay rent, then the land lord can attempt to evict them for cause. In practice, I'm not sure how much this actually happens. But this is one reason why airbnb is so attractive for owners, the guests (I think the term is transients) have no meaningful rights."
sanfrancisco,3ce28d,lithophore,3,Tue Jul 7 08:12:13 2015 UTC,It's just symbolic. It means you book on AirBnB in two or three installments. You will no longer be able to book one stay for more than 75 days. But you will be able to book two or three stays for 75+ days.
sanfrancisco,3ce28d,bunnymeee,-3,Tue Jul 7 08:27:22 2015 UTC,"Making it a hassle and costing more money in booking fees. If that is indeed the text of the referendum and that loophole is allowed to remain, then not only is this a farce it's actually counter productive. My feeling is that AirBnB will themselves enforce it, and thus that 75 limit will not be a law in theory only."

I moved cross-country to the Bay two months ago for a great career break   A lot of the locals that support these regulations see you as a person just here for a job and not because you wanted to move to SF. I came here for both so I'm not here to judge you.   There are really a lot of important fiscal policy levers that can be used   You lose the opposition when you bring out the economics speak. This is an emotional issue for them. They don't care about ""fiscal policy levers"". They just know they and the people they know are being evicted and priced out of the city.  Again, I'm not here to judge. Just know how the opposition feels so you can make a more persuasive argument."
sanfrancisco,3ce28d,ChronicElectronic,-7,Tue Jul 7 15:47:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry to be blunt but it's not all about you and what you want. Or what tourists want. It is all about what we as citizens want. And we don't want AirBnb taking rental stock and operating illegal hotels in non hotel zoned areas.   The referendum should make the will of the voters clear on this.

Really though let's be honest, at this point it's clear you're a cranky nativist home owner who doesn't want anything to change but loves seeing his property value go up.  You shit on libertarians like it's going out of style when you're clearly willing to pretend to be something resembling a liberal when all you really are is anti-other people making profits.  You can't even be bothered to make a counterpoint so your response is to be 'sorry' for lacking any nuance.

As for ""it's only the worst case"": If an EIR states that the trucks will drive X amount more it's because they most definitely will. Again--this isn't a building plan, what's on the table here is pretty well known. What, like the distance to the dump will suddenly be less? Like there's a sweet shortcut or something?"

Recology currently drives the trash to a dump they don't own in Altamont and pays twice as much as they would if they took it to their own dump in Vacaville.   Kromm added that it comes down to a business decision for Recology, which currently hauls the garbage to Altamont and not to the landfill it owns near the city of Vacaville even though the Hay Road Landfill is a 40 mile-longer trip.  However, the decision was up to San Francisco, and according to Potashner, Altamont’s tipping fee is twice as much as Recology’s.   http://www.thereporter.com/general-news/20150418/plan-to-haul-sfs-trash-to-vacaville-landfill-is-garbage-to-some"

The golf course is only ""public"" on a surface level. Sure if you're white and don't look too dirty you can walk around in it. But to actually make use of it you need to pay, and if you look anything less than reputable I'm sure you'd be kicked out. If you're going to insult me at least say something constructive and intelligent."

sanfrancisco,3cdao3,instant_michael,2,Tue Jul 7 03:49:00 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem is that we have a divided, broken federal government. A lot of the laws in California are created with good intentions in order to counter act really backward federal law. Both parties know we need federal reform on issues like immigration, homelessness, taxation, healthcare, etc but our government is so broken that nothing gets done. So in the meantime the people of California push for state level band aids. The problems these band aid laws fix are very valid, for example giving illegal aliens drivers licenses makes sense so they're not totally undocumented, but all of these laws create massive unintended consequences. We're stuck voting for either backward federal policy or sad attempts of fixing what should be fixed  in the federal level. We're not the California Republic and sadly some things are out of our league to truly make right."

We can start with rejecting the false dichotomy that ""some are here to work and some are here to continue their criminal lifestyle."" That's true in a literal sense but gives the false impression that there's some balance between the two categories. The vast majority of undocumented immigrants in America are here to work in America and are otherwise as law abiding as everyone else in our country. The violent criminal element can't be ignored, but when undocumented immigrants are broadly painted as bad and dangerous criminals, which is often the portrayal, it is nothing more than unfounded nativism and scaremongering.   Of course, there's a rich tradition of painting out-group immigrants in the worst possible light in America. See: Chinese, Japanese, Irish, and Eastern European."
sanfrancisco,3cdao3,MilitantManatee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:08:41 2015 UTC,This article has some statistics you should look at
sanfrancisco,3cdao3,thisoneorthatone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:32:19 2015 UTC,"I read the opinion piece you linked to from Glenn Beck's website. Curious, I tried to independently corroborate these unsourced numbers and was unsuccessful. Can you?   According to Federal Bureau of Investigation crime statistics, 95 percent of arrest warrants in Los Angeles are issued for illegal immigrants, not American citizens.  Seventy-five percent of the people on law enforcement’s “Most Wanted” list in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Albuquerque are also illegal immigrants.  In addition, 53 percent of all investigated burglaries reported in California, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas are perpetrated by illegal aliens.  The FBI also reports that a whopping 25 percent of inmates inside California’s state prisons, county jails, and municipal detention facilities are Mexican nationals.   Three appear to be adaptions from this e-mail forward, falsely attributed to the Los Angeles Times. You can click on that link to see how they are falsely presented. If these are actual verifiable stats, I'd love to see their original source material.  For a data set backed up by verifiable data, this Pew analysis is a good starting point. First generation immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than citizens. Their children have higher crime rates than their parents. However, that crime rate is basically on par with citizens. As described in the analysis, ""It's the dark side of assimilation."""
sanfrancisco,3cdao3,MilitantManatee,-4,Wed Jul 8 02:21:44 2015 UTC,"So we should call you a criminal, because you went 28 in a 25 mph zone? Of course I am sure you've never smoked weed, which is a federal felony.  Not all laws are the same."

sanfrancisco,3cdao3,Kalium,-4,Tue Jul 7 21:32:40 2015 UTC,Why would San Francisco (or California) do that?  Kamala Harris was directly responsible for the assassination of an entire family and went on to get elected AG and will probably be the next federal Senator of CA.

sanfrancisco,3cdao3,praxulus,12,Tue Jul 7 05:13:52 2015 UTC,What the fuck are you talking about exactly???  She shielded Edwin Ramos from ICE after being arrested for various crimes including weapons charges who then went on to assassinate the entire Bologna family because Ramos drove the wrong way down a one way street.
sanfrancisco,3cdao3,Patranus,9,Tue Jul 7 05:31:18 2015 UTC,"People keep bringing this up but its just 100% untrue. Kamala Harris didn't ""shield"" him from ICE -- ICE failed to put an immigration hold on Ramos for unknown reasons. They did in fact check before releasing him after that weapons charge. The other violent felonies he had were committed while he was a juvenile, which the original sanctuary policy excepted. A week after the murders, the policy was changed to abide by ICE holds for violent juvenile felonies."
sanfrancisco,3cdao3,Y_BOT,7,Tue Jul 7 06:04:16 2015 UTC,"So she released a known illegal immigrant who was arrested on weapons charges, a known MS13 gang member, and had other felonies.  Got it."
sanfrancisco,3cdao3,Patranus,0,Tue Jul 7 07:29:42 2015 UTC,"Look obviously Ramos was a piece of shit who shouldn't have been on the streets, but you're trying to paint this in an over-simplified and untrue way. Let me go point by point.   So she released a known illegal immigrant   Yes, the DA doesn't deport people, ICE does. They checked with ICE before releasing him and there was NO immigration hold. None at all. ICE messed up.   arrested on weapons charges   Yes, when you drop the charges against someone you typically let them out of jail.  He was pulled over for an illegal window tint and a passenger in his car was found to have a weapon. There was no way they could prove that Ramos knew his passenger had the gun and thus the charge was dropped   a known MS13 gang member   Again he was a piece of shit but being a known gang member isn't illegal. Commuting a crime as a gang member is illegal. Planning a crime with a gang is conspiracy. Loitering as a gang can be illegal. But you can't throw someone in jail for being a ""known gang member""   and had other felonies.   Yes he committed felonies when he as a teenager, for which he was convicted and sentenced. He carried out the sentences. Once someone does their time you can't put them in jail again for the same crime."
sanfrancisco,3cdao3,Y_BOT,4,Tue Jul 7 15:46:15 2015 UTC,You progressives shielding responsible parties are hilarious.   You admit he was a peace of shit gang member and committed felonies yet you argue that he didn't do anything illegal.    Yet he was an illegal immigrant.  Hrm.  Why should they be releasing any illegal immigrant?
sanfrancisco,3cdao3,Patranus,0,Tue Jul 7 17:13:16 2015 UTC,You admit he was a peace of shit gang member and committed felonies yet you argue that he didn't do anything illegal.   That't not even close to what I argued
sanfrancisco,3cdao3,Y_BOT,2,Tue Jul 7 23:38:38 2015 UTC,The implication is that the city should have assumed brown people should be fingered to ICE just in case they want to throw them down some hole.

sanfrancisco,3cdao3,BaronVonMannsechs,2,Tue Jul 7 08:50:51 2015 UTC,Maybe ICE should have sought a warrant instead of issuing a mere detention request. A warrant establishes probable cause to detain the person; a detention request does not.

The point is that it's hard to see the sidewalk since the tiny section of raised curb (thanks to the large bulbout ramp) is not very visible due to the sloping nature of the street. If you approach from the East, the corner is pretty well hidden below the slope of the road. Combine that with driving at night and low visibility, and people are going to have problems.

Fell is pretty hectic at night and with people driving slow for all sorts of reasons (e.g. lyft/uber pickup, looking for parking, looking for a street sign etc), therefore many people are trying to pass slower cars from all sides.  The rain garden thing is not well lit and is not a common feature.  Usually the space it occupies is road.  Therefore, an unfamiliar person may try to pass someone as they drive through the divis intersection and end up in the raingarden."

sanfrancisco,3ccacr,eean,13,Tue Jul 7 17:52:50 2015 UTC,"I don't really get the point of figuring out how much people pay in rent who live here already. Don't we already know how much we pay in rent?   OTOH the number by Zillow etc of how much rent costs when someone tries to find a place now seems relevant to anyone moving into the area. Had a frustrating conversation the other day about rent control which tripped over this distinction. Rent control provides financial stability but it does absolutely nothing to get rent prices down for folks looking for a place to live. (I mean we could have price controls where newcomers paid the same as longtime tenants, but that's just not the system we've ever had in the US in peacetime.)"
sanfrancisco,3ccacr,bq13q,5,Mon Jul 6 21:36:29 2015 UTC,I agree that this is a much less interesting statistic compared to market rents (which matter not only to people moving into the area but also for people who might wish to move around within an area).  It isn't totally useless though; it is helpful for quantifying the distortion in the market due to rent control and for filling out the economic picture vis a vis low and moderate income residents (who clearly are not paying market prices for housing).
sanfrancisco,3ccacr,eean,2,Mon Jul 6 21:50:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed, you could do some interesting research, but I don't see why it's interesting in the popular press without the extra number crunching."

sanfrancisco,3ccacr,Awfy,13,Wed Jul 8 14:43:46 2015 UTC,"My theory is that most people who rent do pay less than the reported averages because they sublease rooms. This makes it seem like rent is exceptionally high even though a lot of people won't be paying near those prices.   Most of these reports are also about 1-bedroom apartments. Which, in a tight density city like SF, are a luxury. As much as that's hard to hear and that it really shouldn't be the case that they're a luxury, that's just how cities at this density work. 1-bedrooms are most people's preferred way to live but they waste a lot of space.   For every 1-bedroom apartment you also have 1 kitchen, 1 bathroom, and most likely 1 living room. In a 3-bedroom apartment alone you're saving a minimum of 4 extra rooms (potentially 6) that people really don't need (mostly just want).  Raising a family or being in a serious relationship is hard under these circumstances, but that's the cost of wanting to live in a world famous city which is limited to only so much land and is surrounded on all sides by extremely lucrative industries."

Would you rather SF be like New York where it's just like here, but all hedge funds and bankers instead of developers?  I know there is a lot of crap that is made here, but there is also a lot of good.  At least we're not stealing money from people's pensions like those bankers.  That's why I never wanted to work for any investment companies.  I want to earn my living creating, not destroying.  But the thing with SF is it isn't as prepared to support all of these people like NY (kinda) is.  Now the rents are even starting to price us out, which is only going to leave financial people able to afford it.  I live with a roommate who works 2 jobs and over 60 hours a week to be able to barely scrape by, and it sucks to see it.  I'm subsidizing her room even!    The only people who are to blame for this are the politicians who aren't doing shit (or worse, spending 18mil on land for subsidized housing that they sold for 3mil 6 years ago), and the greedy-ass landlords of this city (and maybe airBnB).  The worst thing about these apartments are that even for $3500 a month, you get a pretty terrible looking place, with awful windows and shitty appliances.  Because they don't want to let a single dollar go into actually making the place feel like it's worth the money.  So all of that money goes out of the economy, into the bank account of some millionaire.    And just to defend us, a lot of us came from nothing, and this is how we got out.  I grew up living on food stamps and the terrible wage my mother made as a nurse.  I worked my entire life to get out of that situation, and I made it.  This city has a lot of amazing qualities that some of us really enjoy, and we really do want to be a part of it.  But a lot of the city doesn't want us to.... Did people really like San Francisco when more neighborhoods were just like the tenderloin is now?  Before it was 'gentrified'."

It looks like they're trying to refute the $3k and $4k numbers that have been tossed around by other companies.  Got news $2300 a month IS NOT BETTER! If you pay ~200 in utilities that brings it up to $2500. Figuring the general rule of spending ~30% of your salary on rent and housing you're looking at  a necessary salary of $90k-$100k minimum to feasibly live in the city.  That's almost DOUBLE what the average American FAMILY makes per year. That's asinine. This city is too damn expensive to be worth it.

sanfrancisco,3ca0ex,1PantherA33,31,Mon Jul 6 08:17:50 2015 UTC,"well, it was a mistake to create the policy in the first place."
sanfrancisco,3ca0ex,dboy999,10,Mon Jul 6 16:12:46 2015 UTC,"It is supposed to improve relations between law enforcement and minority communities. Essentially so people aren't being deported for routine traffic stops, and are more likely to cooperate and talk with the police. It is only supposed to be for nonviolent offenses. Which this guy apparently didn't have any of. I am not well enough informed, to have a strong opinion on the policy."
sanfrancisco,3ca0ex,1PantherA33,3,Mon Jul 6 16:56:13 2015 UTC,"This wasn't a traffic stop. It was a drug charge SF had him transferred from Texas for, then decided to not charge him AND refuse a request from the federal fucking government."

It was a drug charge SF had him transferred from Texas for, then decided to not charge him AND refuse a request from the federal fucking government.   Exactly.  It was a civil request (detainer) not a criminal warrant.  If he was understood to be such a grave threat, why did ICE not get a criminal warrant?"
sanfrancisco,3ca0ex,ihatemovingparts,-7,Tue Jul 7 02:10:42 2015 UTC,"Why are we worried about improving relations with people who are in the country illegally? I mean, shouldn't our relationship with them be trying to find them and deport them?"
sanfrancisco,3ca0ex,el_Sharko,22,Tue Jul 7 14:27:52 2015 UTC,"For example, lets say a crime is commited in the Mission.  The suspect is thought to be Mexican/American.  So SFPD goes around the area the crime was committed asking for information.  They keep finding people without ID/papers so they keep taking them into custody and handing them over to ICE.  They have quickly exhausted the resources that this bicycle theft warranted, and for some reason no one will talk to them or answer the doors anymore.  Then there is a more violent crime and the same thing plays out.  I imagine it is the same concept as giving plea deals to lesser criminals to get them to testify, just with a lot less paperwork."
sanfrancisco,3ca0ex,1PantherA33,15,Mon Jul 6 18:37:07 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but if you are an illegal you often a victim of said crime. If you can't report the crime that puts all the power in the hands of the ""real"" criminal victimizing you."

Would you aid a police investigation or testify in court if you thought the cops would deport you?"
sanfrancisco,3ca0ex,unpickle,-6,Mon Jul 6 21:44:07 2015 UTC,"Because the vast majority of them don't commit crimes...   Other than, you know, the Federal crime of violating immigration law.  Oh, right, laws don't real when you don't personally agree with them. Got it."
sanfrancisco,3ca0ex,el_Sharko,11,Mon Jul 6 18:54:49 2015 UTC,Technically anyone smoking pot is also in violation of federal law. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_history_of_cannabis_in_the_United_States  And yet people in droves have signed up for medical marijuana licenses. Any of those folks using are committing a federal crime. It just doesn't happen to currently be enforced at the federal level. During any time that could change.   Law and order types don't want to admit it but laws are selectively enforced all the time.

Also they pay about 3 billion in taxes in CA. Maybe that would be a good thing as we would all be paying more for services and food but the people providing them could live off the wage.   I am less condoning it and more acknowledging that as long as you have such a poor neighbor and a huge border illegal immigration is going to be a fact. Police could spend all their time ONLY doing that.  Frankly immigration is such a mess in the US it does not surprise me there are so many illegals. I'd favor fining the shit out of the businesses that take advantage of them than the folks just trying to make some money in a place far from home."

Every time you stay in a hotel room, every time you order from a restaurant, every time you let a worker pick up your office's garbage, every time you buy produce at Safeway - you're indirectly contributing to illegal immigration.  Support immigration reform and a guest worker visa program, and then we'll see the number of illegals dramatically decrease, because it won't be worth jumping the fence anymore if instead they can apply for legal status.  And those not getting their shit together get deported, because no excuses."

sanfrancisco,3ca0ex,twistedmind1586,-5,Tue Jul 7 03:00:47 2015 UTC,"Yes. San Francisco and many other cities around the US have had this policy for years, and we shouldn't overreact because of one incident which was not in any way caused by the fact that this guy was undocumented. It could just as easily have been a US citizen who picked up that gun.    In fact, the problem most directly connected to this tragedy is the availability of guns in the US. It's hard to imagine this happening in any other developed country where guns don't outnumber people."
sanfrancisco,3ca0ex,percussaresurgo,2,Tue Jul 7 03:40:20 2015 UTC,Actually those happen in other countries with strict gun control policy as well. Just not as often. But don't believe that it's that hard for someone to procure a gun in Britain or Argentina or Spain.

I notice the same thing down on the peninsula in the way the public works department designs stop lights and sidewalks. What they do seems designed to make their job easier, not to delight the citizens.  I still shake my head when I see the peninsula train stop ""weather shelters"".

This accommodation reduced the available space by forcing Caltrain design cars that can be used with both the current, low-level platforms, and to-be-completed elevated platforms."
sanfrancisco,3c7s2f,old_gold_mountain,2,Mon Jul 6 01:16:14 2015 UTC,"The multiple door heights would be a temporary measure until all of the station platforms can be upgraded. The shared platforms are not really an outcome of peninsula cities concerns, but were a request from local transit advocates to better integrate the two services an ease passenger access while reducing station costs. The shared platforms will really help at the Transbay terminal, since space is so limited and shared platform areas will allow for greater flexibility in routing both future high speed trains and Caltrain. Down the line, future high speed rail stations at Millbrae and San Jose were initially proposed above and below Caltrain stations because of platform incompatibility. The Millbrae station alone was estimated to cost $1 billion, but it would actually be harder for people to get to their trains because of the additional stairways and wayfinding complexity. The same is true for San Jose. Shared platforms reduce cost, simplify passenger access, and allow funding for other station upgrades."

Caltrain is regularly filled over 100% capacity in both bike-cars and non-bike cars during rush hour. Increasing bike space and removing restrooms in favor of seats will make more room for people who use it on a daily business - not just those who take it to sporting events.

I took Uber last week and my driver told me he drives to San Francisco from Sacramento on his days off just to make extra cash. But he said there are over 12,000 cars on the road so it seems like the market might be saturated. It's nice though that every time I summon Uber someone is there in 5 minutes"
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,Hannachomp,11,Sun Jul 5 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"This wasn't mine, this was my cousins who drives uberx, I currently drive for uber black. But anyhow, he worked most of the day and he made $500+ before 12am.  He got really lucky though, he got mostly long trips. One of his trips hit $180. He started in the city and got pulled out of the city. From SF down towards San Jose, then Freemont, up as far north as Berkeley Hills, then finally back to SF. It went completely dead for him past 1am, too many other drivers on the road, called it a night.  Weekends can be difficult given the amount of other drivers on the street. Those ads about uber where you make $XX an hour can be misleading. Most folks won't make that every hour if you work 8 straight hours (or if you average it). But it is possible if you are experienced and know the city/bay area well. And its not just about heading to surge areas (cause many other drivers will be head there and probably beat you to it), you literally need to get a feel for the life of the city, know what events are going on, and anticipate areas during a certain time that will get busy. There are also dead days where no matter what you do you're not going to make much and your going to have to work much longer just to reach your minimum goal. And that's the thing, set a goal amount and work towards it. While working don't think how much your making an hour. That request to drop someone far off in the East Bay/Peninsula may come from an area you least expected.  It also helps that you network. I have four cousins who also drive and we have a group txt updating each other what's going on. That's where I got this screenshot.  I on the other hand made about $400 before 12am, which is kinda average. But I started late, and was stuck mostly downtown doing short trips. Didn't have a single airport or long trip. But between 12am to 5:30 I made about another $400 (had two early airport runs). This may seem high compared to uberx but my overhead is MUCH higher driving a 8.5mpg (in the city) SUV. I still plan to work more today in a couple hours. Just woke up!   oh I should say Friday was DEAD! I started late and thought I could at least hit my minimum goal. I actually ended up in the negative as I also rent my Black Car SUV for $100 /day. Too many other drivers out, and barely any requests. I quit earlier than normal and went home to play videogames :P   You can do well but be patient and learn. Talk to other drivers too, make friends!  /edit: clarity/typos (same deal on some of my other comments)"
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,jadedgoldfish,2,Sun Jul 5 21:13:37 2015 UTC,Can you clear up the tipping thing? I almost always tip in cash because I can't figure out how to tip in the ap.Then I hear from others I'm not supposed to tip. What's the deal?
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,ultimogaijin,6,Sun Jul 5 22:58:09 2015 UTC,"Lyft has tipping in the app.  Uber doesn't want riders to tip, please don't feel obliged to.  If a rider offers me a tip, I say no please don't feel obliged to. But if they insist and put it in my face I'll graciously accept it. Pushing it away could be seen as rude with some people and can negatevely effect me when they rate me.  Driving for uber black I encounter this more often than when I did regular uberx.  Among the uber driver circle, I've been hearing that drivers have been pushing for a tipping option in the app. Honestly I'm pretty neutral about it. On one hand not having a tip functionality probably attracts riders, so it could be detrimental to the business to implement it. Then on the other hand getting tipped is nice, yet still I honestly don't want people to feel obliged to, in the long run it could lower the amount of rides I get.  Actually I kinda have negative feelings adding a tipping function in the app. I've heard stories from riders who have used Lyft, get a shitty ride, and the driver has the gall to demand for a tip. And hence those riders chose to ride with me/uber and no longer use Lyft.  I actually hear a lot of other negative stories about Lyft (dirty vehicles mostly, trash/used cups found in the back), and even with regular uberx (out of town drivers who have no clue driving in SF).. so they prefer to ride with $$ black and that's fine by me. (btw, blacks city knowledge test is significantly more difficult to pass) If you ever have a questionable ride with any ride service please say something or report it!"
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,cromagnum_android,2,Sun Jul 5 23:20:11 2015 UTC,"Making tips standard would just give uber an excuse to further reduce fairs, probably making it a wash for drivers anyway."

So I'm grateful to the drivers who talk to me share their knowledge and help me find a good bar or even to fix a mistake I made ordering Uber in the first place.
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,Simon_x,2,Sun Jul 5 23:26:29 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear you joined ;)  Regardless of where you prefer to work in the bay you're going to get pulled into the city/SFO. Downtown is tricky with all the one ways and no left turns (there are a NUMBER of places the GPS will show you can turn bit it's illegal, so pay attention!). GPS is not dependable, some areas the tracking is way off (financial district/twin peaks), and its good to hear riders are giving you tips. Never argue, feed off their knowledge, even if it may be wrong. When going north through SOMA the GPS often wants you to get on the freeway (bad idea/traffic unless past 11pm), take Dubose/14th/under the freeway and turn left onto Folsom/Bryant if its heading towards/past the ballpark. During traffic Bush/Battery are good until you get anywhere near Market street and it's BAD! If you need to get on the bridge during traffic you're better off crossing Market via Jones/Hyde (via Golden Gate if needed), crossing Market then getting to a bridge entrance through SOMA. Octavia/South Van Ness freeway entrances can also be better if coming out from Richmond/Marina districts.  Best of luck!"
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,Pikachut,2,Sun Jul 5 23:52:21 2015 UTC,Oh so long trips are good? I always feel bad taking long trips from like SF to MV if cal train stops running or MV to SF if I have to be somewhere in a rush and couldn't wait for the next cal train.
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,troIIoIIo,0,Sun Jul 5 21:33:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely, especially with surge pricing. But they can suck to if the city is busy but you got pulled out far to a dead area (Concord/Fremont), and you simply have to make your way back to the city/area where its busy. Or to the nearest area you can anticipate where there will be requests."
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,Simon_x,3,Sun Jul 5 21:43:43 2015 UTC,Barely anything... My boyfriend was driving last night for 4 hours and made $100. People see the surge and don't take the rides.
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,troIIoIIo,5,Sun Jul 5 20:03:17 2015 UTC,Surely the algorithm would make supply/demand equal?
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,Simon_x,0,Sun Jul 5 20:30:18 2015 UTC,"It's not actually due to demand exceeding supply, it's because people are willing to pay more at that particular time. If people actually take fewer rides due to higher prices, that's okay because uber doesn't have to pay the drivers sitting idle, a key factor in this equation. You often see rows and rows of drivers on the map sitting idle during these times, something that would never happen if it were based on supply and demand. If it were, prices would go down as more drivers came on; prices would would end up to be pretty unpredictable and wouldn't necessarily even be higher at peak times, and might even be highest at the least popular times. Uber is a rent-seeker, not a market-maker."
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,troIIoIIo,11,Sun Jul 5 21:06:19 2015 UTC,"Where did you hear this? Surge pricing is an algorithm. It is literally supply and demand. If demand is high but there aren't enough drivers then surge mode kicks in (automatically, there's no one flipping a switch) to encourage more drivers to turn on the app."

It's by far in Uber's best interest to have lower prices, more drivers on the road and more passengers on trips."
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,Eclipsed830,-6,Mon Jul 6 01:04:35 2015 UTC,If it's in interest of Uber to keep prices lover why we have this price surge thing exist? Why it's not just one price for everybody anytime?

sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,burgeoning_philosoph,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:22:55 2015 UTC,Not sure about with Uber but with Lyft prices do fluctuate with demand. Its based on a ratio of idle cars to cars with passengers within a certain distance. Thats why one minute it can be 100% primetime in an area and the next no PT.
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,rushingkar,2,Sun Jul 5 21:56:26 2015 UTC,"Does it go down when supply is ample? That's the key question. When demand is higher than supply then they have to raise prices; when supply is higher than demand is the difference. Under market pricing prices must fall when supply increases, in the uber/lyft pricing schemes they're potentially highly incentivized against that."
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,Awfy,2,Sun Jul 5 22:59:13 2015 UTC,"potentially highly incentivized against that   I wonder if even Uber knows how much. Pricing is complex, and it's possible that lowering prices might increase profits for Uber in some cases.  For example, if Uber gets a 25% cut, and if setting the price at $10/ride gives them 100 customers, then they make $250. If lowering the price to $9.50/ride attracts an additional 10 customers, they make more: $261.25. (Of course, even though Uber's per-ride costs are probably very low, they do have some costs like credit card processing fees, but these are probably less than $11.25 for 10 rides.)  On the other hand, Uber also gains something by keeping some percentage of drivers idle, so that there are always drivers available to respond to requests to be picked up. Also, by lowering prices, Uber is making things less profitable for its drivers (what's left over from taking out expenses from 75% of $9.50 instead of 75% of $10), and attractive/keeping drivers is important to their business.  Basically, Uber needs to optimally balance all these concerns. They may not have things fine-tuned that well yet. Heck, they may need to research to figure out the right parameters to do that fine-tuning. For example, how many more customers will they actually pick up by dropping the price from $10 to $9.50, under a certain set of conditions?"

sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,champagnepupi,7,Mon Jul 6 19:20:59 2015 UTC,That's why you uberpool.
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,cirion5,2,Sun Jul 5 22:07:07 2015 UTC,"Very true! That can actually get pretty high too if you use it out to the peninsula, no 2nd rider, and surge pricing. I once had a fair hit $130 just from Castro to SSF. So beware! The rider did expect the fair to be high though and knew there probably wont be a 2nd rider to where he's heading. The $7 uberpool thing only works for the north half of the city. (idk if if its even still $7 as I've been driving black car for a while)."
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,rnjbond,6,Sun Jul 5 22:15:06 2015 UTC,"Idk about uber, but with Lyft Line, it gives you the price before requesting the ride, and I don't think it changes after you request, regardless of if your ride gets another pickup or surge or anything"

sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,sfchristobal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:14:05 2015 UTC,"Overall I'm defending the industry of paid ridesharing more than Uber specifically as a company. They definitely do some shitty things.  I'll need to look into that citypaper quote when I have more time, not sure where the 28% number is coming from, my numbers could be off.  As for the ""math of their pay""... that's just marketing. I'm not sure I understand the argument. Uber claims drivers earn more, but really more money is going to Uver's pocket. OK. That doesn't really change whether or not the drivers are being payed fairly, it just means they are being shitty with wording and marketing.    Seeing how the rating system essentially make the passenger your ""boss"". Would you complain about your job to the person whose tips feed you and whose bad reviews could get you fired? No, you grumble and complain like the rest of us do, off the clock to our friends.    This is clever, but I don't buy it. Sure they might not complain to me or tell me they can't make rent, but the drivers I'm talking about have gone out of their way to tell me all about how their last job sucked and how much more they like this job. They might pretend to be in a good mood to stimulate happy conversation and raise their rating, but to suggest that they are bullshitting stories and lying to my face is a bit extreme. The fact that they keep getting more and more drivers seems to suggest that driving for Uber is a good alternative to other jobs, or a good way to supplement income. Many of the drivers I've spoken to started out part-time and then shifted to full time because it was better. Either that or they are all tremendous actors with great made-up backstories to improve their rating.  Personally, I've started using Lyft more as I find it to be a friendlier service in general, but I've heard similar stories from drivers of both services, and in fact, many of them actually drive for both, switching off to maximize their income. Similarly, many riders here (in San Francisco) have both apps installed, and will check both. So if Uber treats its drivers too shitty, they will start driving for lyft, which will cause wait times and surge prices to increase in Uber, and drive more customers to their competitor. I understand this isn't the case in many cities, but it definitely is here."

sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,deadershoppingmalls,2,Mon Jul 6 21:53:44 2015 UTC,"I'm morally opposed to Uber in SF because the system for getting a taxi medallion is onerous, and people have sacrificed so much into a system that limits taxis on the streets and has significant costs. Uber has circumvented that system and has destroyed the value of taxi medallions which cost $250k and has also ruined the livelihood of professionals who have put in significant effort and time only to see it eroded by a city greedy for money.   I never have bad experiences with taxis. I always chat with the drivers, and if I don't use Flywheel, I have cash because I know that they are required to float the money for the credit cards until that money is disbursed to the company (I think that takes a month or so)."
sanfrancisco,3c6wr5,sfchristobal,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:17:52 2015 UTC,"I totally feel for those drivers that bought medallions, they got royally screwed. I think they ought to have a case to get some of that money back, because what they purchased wasn't worth anything.  However, I find it hard to place that blame with Uber. Do you really think the taxi medallion system was fair and good for drivers and consumers? Maybe in some places, but my general experience, as well as lots of other people, were that it was very difficult to get a taxi unless you were in certain areas at certain times. Flywheel has certainly helped, but there's no way it would even exist without competition from Uber and the like. Taxi's had a monopoly and didn't have to improve. I didn't often have problems with the actual drivers, but I did receive my fair share of ""I'm not going all the way over there"" or ""Credit card machine broken"". I also always pay cash if I have it, but sometimes I don't. My #1 problem was that I'd call, and never get picked up. Almost missed a flight because of it, and swore never to call a taxi again. I think it was because I lived close to a tourist area, so they'd just pick up someone who flagged them, instead of driving the extra 5 blocks to get to my place and pick me up. And there was no rating system, no recourse, etc. I'm sure you've heard all of this before.  Medallions were outrageously priced and hoarded and broken. Uber has its problems, for sure, but I see it as a step in the right direction.  In any case, thanks for the answer, this is a topic I find very interesting."

There's also plenty of spas in that area to fulfill your spa wishes. Shops with awesome clothes and funky stuff line the whole area. It's also pretty flat, which is a plus.

What I, and the other poster, we're attempting to convey was that labor is a fraction of the cost of a burrito.  What size fraction has been left unaddressed, but let's agree that it is less than 100% because food and rent are not free.  So if labor costs raise 14% it is not logical to assume costs have raised 14%. Unless you are alleging raising minimum wage will cause all costs across the board to immediately inflate 14%, i.e tomatoes now cost 14% more because the tomato slicer makes 14% more. Again that conclusion requires the food to have no cost and their transportation to be free."

sanfrancisco,3cdci5,roboczar,18,Tue Jul 7 04:04:06 2015 UTC,"I don't see why this is hard to understand, labor is only a fraction of the cost of any product out there. I'm not a businessman at all but it's pretty common sense to understand that there are lots of other things that go into what dictate the price of any given item, off the top of my head with Chipotle I'd guess you have rent, the cost of the items that make up the food, various fees and taxes, and employee pay. I'm sure the list is a little more extensive than that but that's enough to prove the point.   So if there are other factors in play here, you can't really say that a 14% increase in something that's a fraction of it's overall price correlates to a 14% increase in the overall cost of the item. I mean, this isn't really rocket surgery here, it's pretty simple math.  Now, as to what that increase can be attributed to, I can't say for certain, but what /u/PossiblyAsian guessed sounds pretty spot on to me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

You're not stupid, you're trolling. You can't possibly, earnestly be arguing that you don't understand that the cost of labor (even including EVERYTHING besides just the wage) is still not the entire input cost required to run a business?  If the humans (wages plus all your other considerations, insurance, payroll taxes, disability, hell let's add tuition reimbursement!) are HALF the cost of running Chipotle (still a huge overstatement but i'm trying to be generous here), and the total human cost gets 10% more expensive, then the price of the burrito is only driven up 5% by the human cost.  If Chipotle raises their prices by 10% in response to labor getting 10% more expensive, they are pocketing a 5% price increase. They do that because stupid people don't understand how to multiply fractions.  EDIT: I should add that i'm STILL being generous with the above logic, since a 10% labor cost increase only pushes up the burrito cost 5% if the burrito was originally sold at cost. There is profit built in to the previous price, so the total input cost of the burrito was somewhat lower than the price to begin with."

sanfrancisco,3cdci5,kill-9all,5,Tue Jul 7 01:50:51 2015 UTC,San Francisco doesn't exactly have an unemployment crisis. Our biggest problem is that people have too much money and all their spending is driving up prices across the board.  Diverting more of that spending into the wages of our lowest-paid residents instead of toward ever-higher rents seems like an awesome tradeoff.
sanfrancisco,3cdci5,UnReal31337,0,Tue Jul 7 03:02:01 2015 UTC,"Diverting more of that spending into the wages of our lowest-paid residents instead of toward ever-higher rents    As great as it sounds, I don't think that's how it works (increasing one does not necessarily decrease the other...)"
sanfrancisco,3cdci5,Cheesebro69,0,Tue Jul 7 05:00:01 2015 UTC,"An increased cost of living definitely puts downward pressure on rent. People either leave or just have less money to bid up rents.  Whether an increased minimum wage actually results in more money paid to minimum wage workers is more nuanced, but it can certainly happen if the minimum wage starts out low enough relative to the local labor market."
sanfrancisco,3cdci5,ziggykareem,2,Tue Jul 7 05:22:59 2015 UTC,"The theory is solid. But in practice, its negligible to the ridiculous forces of SF supply and demand. A 50 cent increase in burrito prices will not put a dent into a $3500 median rent. Somewhere in Texas, I'm sure this increase will have an effect where the ratio is actually significant, but in SF this sets us back to last hour's rent prices."

Context is the key to the sound.  Guns don't sound like fireworks when used on the street to kill someone. (and yes... they sound different when shot ""jubilantly"" into the air during fireworks)  Maybe at rifle ranges or target practice areas they sound different. The times I shot guns I wore ear protection or it was out in a field.  There is something very distinct about the pacing of shots and the ""pap..pap..pap"" - even the rare occasions when we hear semi-automatic fire it's very distinctive in its rhythm and it is typically followed by a certain type of human scream or car wheels screeching.  Firecrackers have a really distinctive crackle that you can definitely hear on a cold foggy july night, the big m80 types have a huge following boom, rockets nearly always have a whistle before the boom. Street guns don't really sound like those.  In my non-expert opinion and experience you can tell the difference if you know what you're listening for.

From a legal perspective letting the guy go wasn't a proximate cause of the murder unless the city knew he planned to kill someone.

If San Francisco and other cities have made it clear they're not interested in deporting all illegal aliens, it makes sense for the feds to try to figure out a way to work with the cities to prevent potentially dangerous immigrants from being released."

When they did they filed a detainer asking to be notified if the person was going to be released so they could then continue the process that was already started.  San Francisco did not cooperate.  It is absurd.  The Feds should cut off all funding for law enforcement, because they do provide all sorts of grants, to any city that refuses to abide by detainers or federal warrants.    I also hope the family sued the city, because they actions of allowing a convicted violent felon who has an open ICE warrant, which comes up on the III ""rap"" sheet which takes a few hours to get is nearly criminal."

(And they could have gotten that federal warrant from what I can see.  No idea why they didn't.)  It's also not just SF, but ""three states, the District of Columbia, and at least 293 localities (29 cities and 264 counties) have officially restricted the extent to which law enforcement may continue to detain individuals to hand over to ICE.""  I tend to agree with the idea that ICE shouldn't be able to issue quasi-warrants that have not gone through due process and are enforced at the burden and cost of those that have to comply with due process.  Which is what the city said when the law was passed."
sanfrancisco,3c2k0t,fonetik,4,Sat Jul 4 16:54:21 2015 UTC,"First, the entrance and deportation of non-citizens is the province of the Federal Government and not the State.  Second, the detainer is the initial process of the due process of a deportation proceeding.  For the federal warrant to issue a federal offense and charge would have to have been filed, which is not always the case.  That means instead of simplifying the process you force criminal charges to have to be filed, which is counter productive because then you are forcing the Feds to actual criminalize the process instead of trying to keep it on the civil side.  Then keep in mind what happens is when an illegal alien is picked up by ICE is they do a want/warrant search and if there is one they ask the issuing agency if they want the person.  This is because it makes no sense to do a deportation proceeding then have the guy convicted of a crime and sent to prison and then have to do the process again.  So the defer the process.  SFPD should have said they did not want him and/or agreed to the detainer.  This is not someone that was picked up by SFPD then a detainer filed.  This was a guy picked up by ICE given to SFPD because of the warrant.  SFPD had to say they wanted him returned in the warrant.   So my response would be not to provide any courtesy to cities with these policies.  Cut federal funding to their agencies and cities for law enforcement and/or prosecutor's offices.  Because the bottom line is that the detainer is valid under Federal Law and has been upheld upon judicial review, which is the proper venue to attack the legality of a federal law and not in the offices of city legislators."

The sheriffs office (SFSO) is responsible for detention of arrested individuals and security of judicial proceedings. SFPD does not have any interaction with ICE in regards to the custody of illegal/undocumented individuals, it's all SFSO."
sanfrancisco,3c2k0t,sam_burke,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:07:45 2015 UTC,"You are partially correct.  The original warrant was issued by SFPD.  So the person is turned over to SFPD, the issuing agency.  SFPD then processes the arrest then turns the person over to corrections, SFSO, and their job is done.  So SFPD had an interaction in this case.  It really depends on the circumstances of custody and how custody is obtained."

Quite frankly, all the 'southern border' talk is a red herring.  EDIT: By Red Herring I meant that the controlling the border to the degree many seem to want is impossible.    Sure, the Chinese built the Great Wall to keep out the Mongols, it took 2000 years and didn't work but it's a great tourist attraction today.  Look at Israel.  They have more control over their borders than probably any other country and yet they still cannot prevent the illegal flow of people, supplies, and weapons.  The Southern Border is a red herring because the goal is simply unachievable.  You want to go after the employers who hire undocumented workers."

sanfrancisco,3c2k0t,dboy999,11,Sun Jul 5 00:53:24 2015 UTC,"Many of the immigrants in sanctuary cities are there on asylum because they are persecuted in their own countries (I.e. Beat, harassed, death threats) for their sexuality, race or other. Sometimes it's just a case of a bad family back home that wants them dead as well. As we can all see the terrible state that Mexico is in, after the Jalisco New Generation Cartel has started to make a name for itself by offing up to 80 people at a time just to gain credit as a cartel. Mexico isn't the only Hispanic country that is unstable at the moment, and we have a lot of Nicaraguan, El Salvadorian, and Panamanian refugees coming in as well. The violence against normal citizens in these countries is absolutely awful and that is why sanctuary cities like SF, Berkeley, and Oakland take in those that can prove that they deserve asylum within reason.   I'm not arguing that this man is a good man, and that he should have been allowed to stay. Normally those granted asylum in the sanctuaries cannot have a criminal history whatsoever. I think his case is one that shows the federal government and the cities need to work together more and communicate the records of each person in question.

The guy had zero violent convictions and the Border Patrol was clearly no match for his reentry skills.  Also, it's not like the City of San Francisco decided to dismiss the charges on which he was brought here--there was a court proceeding with all that due process stuff, presumably.

SFDA declined to prosecute on the warrant (surprise, surprise as they seem to refuse to prosecute any crime that is not a near 100% conviction).  What is suppose to happen is the holding agency, here the sheriff's deputy., is suppose to contact ICE on the detainer.

There's a chance some of those thousand of people will go on to commit a violent crime, and yet not jailing people who smoke weed is still a good idea."

Notice a number of those cities are in Texas itself. But SF gets a whole load of shit over this because we're perceived as this liberal haven that's soft on immigration.

I think we should stay a ""sanctury city"" but SF has gone beyond that.  SF's current law prohibits city officials from assisting ICE officials in any way, which is completely insane, and is not in line with laws in some of the other cities you listed, who consider themselves sanctuary cities.  Situations should be looked at on a case by case basis.  We shouldn't be ignoring a 7 time felon to make eveyone feel warm and fuzzy inside.     Sanctuary laws do a lot of good and can engender trust between public officials and the communities they are responsible for.   If the SFPD is performing raids on behalf of ICE, that's a bad thing.  On the other hand, Sanctuary laws can cause distrust and fear when they allow violent felons who should be deported to be released so they can shoot people randomly.  There's a middle ground between those two extremes.  SF is so worried about pissing off certain constituencies that the pendulum has swung too far in one direction.  And Kate Steinle is dead."

sanfrancisco,3c2k0t,OrganicCertified,8,Sat Jul 4 05:03:50 2015 UTC,"No. Ice turned him over to sfpd over an old Marijuana arrest. The prosecutor decided not to press charges over a years old possession arrest, so since there were 0 active warrants on him, sfpd let him go.  If there had been an active warrant, afpd wouldn't have released him.  Edit for money quote:   On March 27, a San Francisco Superior Court judge dismissed charges of possession and distribution of marijuana against Sanchez for reasons that were not clear Friday. He was held in jail for two more weeks, according to Freya Horne, legal counsel for the San Francisco Sheriff's Office. During that time, Horne said sheriff's deputies checked with federal prison officials to ensure that Sanchez did not have any holds for any other crimes he may have committed, or for any immigration violations. None came up in the prison system, she said.  So, Sanchez, who is a citizen of Mexico, was released on April 15.  ""They are well aware of our policy, and it's a policy that is being adopted by municipalities across the state and the country,"" Horne said.  ICE officials could have ""easily issued a court order,"" Horne said. She added that sheriff's officials had ""no legal basis"" to hold Sanchez after his case was dismissed."

He hasn't been convicted of murder yet. Sfpd is holding him for that trial.  Doesn't he had to wait to be found guilty or innocent? Doesn't matter if he's legal or not?  Yes. That's why he's currently in jail awaiting trial.   I'm trying to understand how someone on trial for murdering an innocent person is allowed free. Or is he not on trial?    Here is the series of events:  Years ago: guy gets arrested for having pot in sf. Guy is not tried for this crime, probably because he was released on bail or his own recognizance and then he just didn't show up for his court date. Years ago: guy gets arrested and convicted for narcotics use. Years ago: guy serves time for narcotics use. Years ago: guys gets deported. Years ago: guy reenters. Years ago: guy gets deported again. Years ago: guy reenters. Years/months ago: guy arrested and convicted of some crime in texas. Years/months ago: guy released from texas prison and put on probation. Months ago: guys gets picked up by ICE for being in the country illegally. Months ago: ICE notices he has a standing warrant for the marijuana arrest at the beginning of this list. Months ago: ICE transfers him to sfpd to handle marijuana trial. Months ago: ICE either fucks up the paperwork or intentionally files it in such a way that they know will mean sfpd will not return him to them when they are done. Months ago: sf prosecutor/judge decline to press charges. Months ago: sfpd looks to see if guy is wanted for any other outstanding warrants or immigration violations and finds none. Months ago: sfpd releases him without informing ICE in accordance with their years-old procedure. Days ago: guy shoots girl. Days ago: girl dies.

You can have a civil dispute with the government.  In this particular case, this has been settled for well over 100 years:   Unlawful Presence in the US is civil. Improper Entry is criminal.   This is similar to the difference between recovering your property from a thief versus from a pawn shop.  The thief committed a crime.  Anyone knowingly receiving stolen property from a thief has as well.  Once the person didn't know it was stolen, it's a civil matter.  Whether that's a good idea or even makes sense, well, that's up for debate.  As a matter of law, however, he was being deported on civil grounds.  Since we're apparently all about looking at policies and laying blame here, this is interesting for two reasons:   The policy of the sheriff's office is to still fulfill detainer requests that are ""supported by judicial determination of probable cause or with a warrant of arrest"".  This appears to be a violation of their own policy (or, perhaps, the feds didn't file the paperwork correctly?). He already was deported five times.  There comes a point when you have ask how much of the blame lies with the local sheriff and how much lies with the border patrol.  In particular, the local police did an amazing job of catching him and making sure he didn't get away.  Saw what you want about the sheriff and his administration, the officers did what they could here and that deserves respect.

Second, this isn't about illegal immigrants having a higher rate of committing violent crimes than the general population as you state below - it's about illegal immigrants who are arrested with multiple prior felony convictions and whether they should be turned over to ICE. It's a specific subset of illegal immigrants who are already felons."

Neighboring cities to San Francisco have much higher crime rates like Oakland (5th most dangerous city over 25k people in the US), East Palo Alto (43rd), and Richmond (67th).

sanfrancisco,3bvqom,TheAntiPedantic,21,Thu Jul 2 21:09:32 2015 UTC,"But SF has a higher violent crime rate than the majority of big US cities, so I'm not sure what your point is.  Do some actual research, and you'll see that this weird idea that some people have (who are often transplants who don't know the city that well, I've noticed), where SF is supposedly extra safe for a big US city, is wrong.   Here's some crime data for you going back to 1985, for every US police agency with a service area of 10,000+ residents:  http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Crime.cfm  In 2008 for example, there were 76 cities of 250,000+ residents in the US.  SF had a violent crime rate higher than 51 of those cities and lower than 24 of them...so that's 67% of big cities that had a lower violent crime rate than SF.  The category SF did worst in was robbery, with a robbery rate higher than 78% of cities.  And if compared to even larger cities, SF still does worse than the majority.  In 2008 there were 35 cities in the US with 500,000+ residents. 22 of them had lower violent crime rates than SF, and 11 that had higher violent crime rates. Once again, SF did bad for robbery rate, coming in at worse than 74% of US cities.  2008 is a little old, but I already had that data ready to post, it made my point, and the rankings should be similar today.  SF obviously isn't the worst for crime or anything, but it's actually worse off than the majority of US cities.  SF has more than a few rough areas, a lot of poor people (100,000 below the poverty line and another 100k just above it, 30,000 public housing units in the city, etc), lots of gangs, tons of drugs, etc, and bad stuff does happen here regularly (over the past decade there have even been a handful of other shootings on the Embarcadero, and other news crew robberies in SF, not that anyone remembers), though this seems to be unknown to many people around the country (AKA the new transplants who make up 75% of SF's population), who apparently seem to think the entire city is populated by rich yuppies/hipsters, ex-hippies, tourists, and the cast of full house."

Since this happened to members of the media, the DA will certainly tell the SFPD to investigate this.  Remember - people always bag on the SFPD for not investigating such crimes. They often don't because the DA won't do shit about it. The problem on those things is not the PD, it's the DA, which in San Francisco has had a long culture of ignoring property crimes and muggings and hit and runs because they won't prosecute them. Remember that when Harris is on the ballot at the Senate primary, or, if she wins it, on the ballot for that seat. Because she contributed to this problem in a major way."

I was shocked that a mayor would appoint a police chief, who has never prosecuted a case or even conducted a criminal trial, as the DA and then a city council would affirm the appointment.  There a so many problems with that.  It is even a bigger joke when the DA is investigating misconduct by the police force which a lot of happened when he was chief of police.    Then the unsuccessful DA gets elected to Attorney General and the new incompetent DA is re-elected.  Basically it is proof positive that if you have the support of the local Democratic Party you will win an election no matter what, and that is sad."

sanfrancisco,3bvqom,SplotchEleven,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:55:37 2015 UTC,"I'm totally for reasonable gun laws. I'm for waiting periods and background checks. I'd even like to see laws go further and require that gun owners attend threat de-escalation courses.  I also recognize that my prior occupation and training help make me not only a more responsible gun owner, but also more likely to be useful in an actual hostile situation.  The underlying point of my joke isn't that I wish there were more guns on the street. I'd be perfectly happy if no one carried legally or illegally, but since that isn't the world we live in, I'd like for law abiding citizens have the ability to intervene in potentially lethal situations when the police aren't able to do so."

sanfrancisco,3bvqom,nvgeologist,3,Thu Jul 2 17:37:50 2015 UTC,Bearing in mind that everything on the internet is true -  Here's an article from about a year ago with a breakdown. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/weapons-and-mass-shootings/
sanfrancisco,3bvqom,Likely_not_Eric,4,Thu Jul 2 17:44:18 2015 UTC,I believe it's the guns stolen from lawful people that tend to end up in the hands of criminals for an affordable price. Reduce the supply and it becomes prohibitively expensive to own a gun illegally.  Not to  mention that if you're searched for something unrelated and found to have a gun you can then be identified as unlawful and have the gun removed. A few decades and it might be much safer.  Edit: The assumption about stolen guns appears to be incorrect. See here.
sanfrancisco,3bvqom,SplotchEleven,3,Thu Jul 2 21:27:25 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see a statistic to back that claim up.   As I understand it, gangs don't have to rely on stolen fire arms. Anyone with a clean record can buy an inexpensive handgun or just leverage affiliated family or associates with clean records to purchase them.  That being said, I don't disagree that having fewer guns available would eventually lower gun crime. There would have to be a major cultural shift in this country for that to happen though. Americans willingly turning in their firearms in return for a tenuous promise that someday maybe things might be safer? That's a tough sell."
sanfrancisco,3bvqom,Ad__Hominem,3,Fri Jul 3 01:30:59 2015 UTC,"If you buy a gun with a clean record and that gun is later tied to a crime, you no longer have a clean record."

It seems I've fallen victim to the common misconception (according to the argicle). From the PBS Frontline:   Stolen guns account for only about 10% to 15% of guns used in crimes  -ATF Agent Jay Wachtel   From this blog post the author estimates that only 6% used legal guns, though the analysis doesn't appear accurate. I was unable to find a statistic on actual firearm use in crimes (whether the user was legally allowed to have the firearm they used).  From the arguments made about the difficulty of enforcement it does seem that if guns were made outright illegal then it would be easier to enforce and thus drive the price up (as risk increases and supply dwindles)."

Your incenting a company to move mass from someone's business or house to a processing facility. You want to incent low landfill usage (land is scarce) and high recycling. Mass is hard to fake (except stealing it) so creating a freer market where people are paid per kilogram of trash they deliver seems like a route to take.

sanfrancisco,3bxdjy,kill-9all,4,Fri Jul 3 02:15:59 2015 UTC,She is right we arrest and release. If they arent going to jail for at least a week why even arrest them?  Someone who breaks into a car window in front of a cop isnt even worth arresting they will be on the street the next day.  You have to enforce crimes at all levels or this is what you get.
sanfrancisco,3bxdjy,_rhetoric_,15,Fri Jul 3 04:17:24 2015 UTC,"In San Mateo even misdemeanors are prosecuted by the District Attorney if the case is solid because they know that the juries in San Mateo do not stand for any bullshit. In San Francisco the DA has to work in the climate that they are in, which is juries which consistently only care about violent crime. Take it for what it is, but the juries here are extremely liberal in that regard. No one likes property crimes, but when it comes down to it, the juries want to ""help"" the criminals not put them in jail. I'm not advocating one way of thinking over the other, I'm just saying that is the way it is in San Francisco as opposed to neighboring counties."
sanfrancisco,3bxdjy,kill-9all,4,Fri Jul 3 10:52:47 2015 UTC,"Interesting do you have any example cases of this occurring?  I can totally see that, its the SF Passiveness.   Its no wonder we have so much property theft. You see a window break in post and not a single person is surprised or even thinks the one committing the crime will be caught."
sanfrancisco,3bxdjy,pezcone,3,Fri Jul 3 16:37:21 2015 UTC,"They aren't released because of juries, they're released because of the supreme court decision regarding over population in prisons. Most criminals sentenced to less than a year in jail are released the same day in california right now."
sanfrancisco,3bxdjy,citronauts,-5,Fri Jul 3 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"If I were on a jury and I had to convict someone who broke in to a car, and stole a $1,000 laptop, but they were to be sentenced to over a year in jail because the item is over $800 or whatever the felony level of theft is, I would probably not convict because I couldn't in good faith sentence someone to 1/40th of their adult life in prison for a small crime.   If the punishment was 15 days in jail and 100 hours of community service, that would be a lot easier to convict."
sanfrancisco,3bxdjy,_rhetoric_,12,Sat Jul 4 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"And therein lies the issue. You are not in charge of sentencing, you are in charge of deciding guilt or innocence. There is a reason there is a judge and a jury, but you want to be both. If you don't get your way, then you will refuse to do your job. This seems to be a common attitude in San Francisco, so criminals get away with crime. Then people come to reddit to bitch about how the police aren't doing their job when it is a revolving door for criminals regardless of police action."
sanfrancisco,3bxdjy,citronauts,-1,Sat Jul 4 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, I understand all that which is exactly why I posted.   My attitude might not be ""right"" but it is the reality of the city.  The politicians in charge need to figure out a way to reduce sentencing while making convictions more likely.  This is the way the world is going and we should be aggressive about getting a better balance in our judicial system.   As someone who grew up in Florida, and has lived in Boston and DC, I find the crime to be disgusting here.  I have never seen so many people with acute mental illness in the public until moving here and we are doing nothing about it.   I don't want to see someone with a mental illness being locked away, but when they are having an episode, police should intervene quickly, they should be evaluated by a psychiatrist.  Every other municipality in this country has procedures in place, but ours does not.   Property crimes should be prosecuted regardless of whether sentences are handed down or not."
sanfrancisco,3bxdjy,_rhetoric_,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:16:42 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying, but I'm curious why you think SF doesn't have procedures for dealing with the mentally ill. SFGH has PES (Psychiatric Evaluation Services) where the mentally ill are taken when they are having an episode where they are considered to be a danger to themselves, others, or are gravely disabled to the degree that they cannot care for themselves in a way that is immediately life threatening. (Section 5150 of the Welfare and Institutions Code) There is also the Dore Street Clinic, which deals with mental illness but not when the person is 5150. There are numerous other mental health facilities in the city as well and they do the best they can. I think that the issue is that there is no real solution for mental illness. These programs act as a bandaid until the person is done with their episode, then it's on to the next one. As you noted, they can't just be locked up indefinitely because of their mental illness.   To your last point, it doesn't make sense for the District Attorney to allocate resources to prosecuting crimes that will not result in convictions. There is already a huge strain on the DA's office without them trying to waste time on a jury trial which for the reasons you listed above will not result in a conviction. The DA instead cuts deals with the public defender in the vast majority of cases to avoid a jury trial that they know they will lose. The result of this is that those negotiations are heavily weighted on the side of the criminal, who will get probation and then set loose on the city again, secure in the knowledge that he can continue to commit property crimes with relative impunity."
sanfrancisco,3bxdjy,citronauts,2,Sat Jul 4 20:36:02 2015 UTC,"I figured we have some set of mental illness procedures but the bar is way too high for police intervention.   At 5:30 on Thursday there was a man taking a shit on Valencia while simultaneously yelling at people passing by.  The police were called, no one came.  This guy was in full meltdown and seemed extremely aggressive.   This is the kind of stuff that would NEVER fly in other cities.  He would be picked up for breaking law.  I honestly believe that the citizens of this city are just accepting that aggressive and illegal behavior is fine as long as it isn't violent.  That is absurd."

Here's what she was saying a couple weeks ago:   Defying what Wiener and others had argued, Kim said “police officers do not prevent crime.” But, she said, “we do know that keeping a kid in school prevents crime.”  Which led to a remarkable suggestion: What if the city decided to take the 283 most at-risk youth and commit to spending $175,000 a year on each of them? “We would make sure they have a secure home, three meals a day, the best education and tutors, and a guarantee that their college education was paid for – and that they could take unpaid summer internships since money wouldn’t be an issue,” Kim said. “Would that make our city safer? I think it would.”   http://www.48hills.org/2015/06/23/supes-decide-that-more-cops-are-the-answer-to-crime/"

sanfrancisco,3bxdjy,emmawatsonsbf,3,Fri Jul 3 18:49:29 2015 UTC,"Hiring more police officers reduces crime. The economic benefits also outweigh the cost of hiring more cops, even at the generous price the SFPD pays. Kim, Campos et. al are dead wrong, as usual. It's even more effective than spending the same amount of money on incarceration. Just putting cops on the street reduces crime, even if there's some level of catch-and-release."

I've seen idiot SJWs in the Mission yelling at some dudes who were detained by SFPD ""you have the right to remain silent!""

As these figures show, it is obvious which faction of uniformed public servants suffered the worst losses. Painful as it may be, the following questions must be asked: * Why was there such a huge discrepancy in fatality rates between these two groups of equally-lauded individuals? * Why have mainstream media outlets fostered equal public adulation for both police and firemen, when the firemen suffered many times more losses? * Why is every police department across the nation permitted, (if not encouraged), to bask in the reflected glory of the NYPD (undeserved as it may be)? * Are we supposed to believe that the lives of policemen are worth more than the lives of the other decedents? Don’t forget, before 9-11 unjustifiably whitewashed their image, the NYPD had a far more sinister, far more realistic, and far more deserved reputation. Are we supposed to forget this fact, (and ignore reality), simply because twenty-three police officers happened to die on the same day that 15 times as many firemen died, and 130 times as many civilians died?

sanfrancisco,3bwmq4,scoofy,-15,Thu Jul 2 21:19:04 2015 UTC,That's where you and I differ. The choice to evict people from their homes should never be made lightly with the sole justification that this is their right. It is absolutely his right but he is essentially destroying people's way of life in doing so.
sanfrancisco,3bwmq4,old_gold_mountain,15,Thu Jul 2 21:27:20 2015 UTC,"So, this is where the structure of disagreement comes.   You advocate a moral view that is post hoc. That is, you ignore that the contract that gave them the ability for this lifestyle came with conditions. One of these conditions is that if the owner wants to move back in, they must move out. Now, today that seem like a hardship, but that's what renters sign up for.   We can talk past each other all day, since we clearly have a different moral framework here, but while you care about the moral dilemma of the present, i'd argue it's a myopic moral argument because it doesn't include the contractual obligations the renter originally signed on to when renting the unit."
sanfrancisco,3bwmq4,scoofy,5,Thu Jul 2 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"but that's what renters sign up for.   The problem is that the renters could not have reasonably foreseen the housing crunch that's hit San Francisco in the past decade or two. When signing the contract, many of these people with middle class incomes could have reasonably expected to be able to find a new apartment if this situation arose. But as time passed, that situation became less and less likely. This makes it more and more important to stay put. Until we get to this situation where it's virtually impossible to relocate without leaving the city entirely."
sanfrancisco,3bwmq4,old_gold_mountain,10,Thu Jul 2 23:04:33 2015 UTC,"But as time passed, that situation became less and less likely.   It would be easier to sympathize if, at that point, rent control beneficiaries began clamoring for housing construction. Or if they were at least doing that now. Or if they at least were not actively working to thwart housing construction."
sanfrancisco,3bwmq4,raldi,4,Thu Jul 2 23:13:42 2015 UTC,"I agree at a high level, but we can't hold individual people being evicted responsible for the political climate of the entire city. We don't know what these peoples' stance on that particular issue is, nor should we predicate our sympathies on their politics. Their personal views are just that - personal. But we all have a responsibility to collectively make the right choices. We've all failed to do that collectively so we need to collectively figure out how to start without witch hunting."

It wasn't abuse.. it was simple inflation.  Clearly the point of it was to keep people in their apartments during boom cycles, not simply to stem abuse.  I don't really care if newcomer libertarians dislike it or disagree with it. The vast majority of voters continue to vote for it and enhance it. It is here to stay and yes it enables people to stay in SF for their lifetime.   And if someone uses Ellis, which was passed mostly by people not from SF who wanted to profit from investments without participating in our community, they are going against the will of the community and committing an immoral act."

sanfrancisco,3bwixg,Richandler,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:21:00 2015 UTC,"So Weiner bill guy is basically admitting to calling in the troops while pretending to care about the culture of the park. The culture that will obviously be trampled by the changes he brought around.   ""I don’t support forcing people to remove beach chairs, kicking Robot Dance Party out of the park, forcing the macaw guy to remove his bird, preventing people from enjoying a six pack or bottle of wine with a picnic, or stopping people from playing music that isn’t blasting and is helping people enjoy themselves."" But he does nothing to ensure that these activities will be allowed. Once you invite rangers or police into an area, you have to expect that they will act in a certain way. It doesn't take a genius to understand the dampening effect that sort of presence will have on the culture that exists in the park or SF in general. If you want a strict society, there are lots of other cities you can go to."

If you listen to the whole video, the newsperson talks about the other two times before now that the mural was defaced."

Would you put a ""gun free zone"" in front of your house like we do at schools?  We provide easy targets where many can be killed by banning guns in specific zones.  Move to Australia or Europe if you are that afraid of guns, let me know how the stabbings go."

Christ, listen to yourself with your stupid straw men arguments about psyche drugs. You and your family are far more likely to ever be shot with you own gun than to ever discharge it in defense. The only reason you think you need a gun is because you allow others to possess guns. It's a death spiral.   And we're not moving to Europe. People who are uncomfortable living in a fucking firing range are the majority in this country, and we will get our shit together. You better believe that in the next 50 years, we'll be coming for your guns here in America.   For your edification, Jim Jeffries"
sanfrancisco,3btyta,psychonaughties,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:00:16 2015 UTC,"Take the gun I don't have, good luck with that.  Nobody said unfettered access but how do you expect to defend your property in the country without a firearm?  Criminals only understand force and will always find ways to kill people.   Good luck taking peoples fire arms, are you going to be the police officer assigned the task.  If you can go back in time and prevent the gun from ever being made them you can effectively ban guns. Any other attempt will fail, in a few years you will be able to just print a gun a home. Good luck stopping that."

Why does this city need more people? I don't know, why does the earth need more people? SF is not your personal gated community. We live in a free country and you can't simply put up walls. You can however build more housing so that this city isn't just affordable housing quotas and ultra rich.  Also, while tech is the accelerator here urbanization is happening all over the country.

Firstly, a city doesn't need people, a city is people.  People need jobs and the current trend is that the jobs are in cities since most new jobs being created involve being around people since we're getting pretty good at growing stuff with machines. Hence cities are growing.   Now with this in mind, it basically leaves 3 options.   1) Sit around whining about it and try and stop any new developments or changes.  2) Build a wall and run some kind of lottery for admission  3) Try and build new houses for the people who are coming anyway.

Those of you who are lionizing him for riding the MUNI forget that he has always done that; just like I have always ridden the MUNI since moving here. 100s of 1000s of people ride the MUNI every day. Now, it would be something special if he was a driver before he got elected, but opted to ride the MUNI after becoming a Supe. That would be noteworthy.  When asked about SFPD abuses, he never bothered to respond again. When Amelie was killed on Folsom, people wrote to him asking for a hearing (or some official reckoning) of the way the SFPD botched the investigation and harassed the bicyclists. But since the SFPD Union is so strong, he steered clear and avoided that topic altogether.  A Supe is supposed to represent you, and be your interface to the City government. He was anything but.

That aside, the bigger issue is that there is too much at stake, for everyone involved, to enact any real sweeping change.   Local politicians risk losing votes and/or support from local constituents and potential campaign donors, should they enact any major legislation that displaces anyone. Current property owners & landlords risk losing money on their current investments. Renters risk potentially losing their living space, should rent control reform happen. Developers risk losing profits should be absolutely forced to build BMR housing, as part of their projects.   No one wants to budge, essentially leaving them in a stalemate.

I'm sure that it is a relevant factor, but I think the economic pressures treated at the start of the video have more impact on policy.  Also I have a quibble about Georgian crescents and canal-side Gothic palaces. Those are both beautiful styles that people have appreciated for hundreds of years and they incorporate classic elements and relationships that people have appreciated for thousands of years. Innovative contemporary architecture isn't necessarily bad or ugly, but any particular innovation is unlikely to be as good as the best architecture civilization has ever produced. So we really shouldn't be afraid to make new buildings that look like classics and I for one will be greatly relieved when mainstream architects are finally ready to move on from the revolutionary 1960s and the architects' narcissistic preoccupation with stylistic innovation."

You can see it from the Victorians in the northeast part of the city and the Spanish style of homes in the South/Western part of town  That fits into the narrative of how so many projects enter gridlock in the planning process for not fitting into the ""character"" of the neighborhood. That being said when I was in Boston I noticed that in the older parts of town known for it's Brownstones that a lot of the new developments in the same neighborhood pay homage to their style yet still have their own contemporary features that set them apart, though that's coming from an objective standpoint, I kinda cringed a little when I noticed them.

sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,scoofy,2,Thu Jul 2 05:25:05 2015 UTC,"The ought to make it a ceramic mosaic... Paint can easily be removed, replacement tiles are trivially easy to procure, and it's fireproof."
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,loudin,2,Wed Jul 1 23:43:54 2015 UTC,"We need to replace the mural. We can't be bullied into submission because it sends a dangerous message - if bad people are persistent enough, they can diminish the work of the good people.  Any chance we could maybe set up a camera system or have an SFPD officer stand patrol near the mural to catch the people doing this?"
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,aarong707,10,Wed Jul 1 16:16:59 2015 UTC,Any chance we could maybe set up a camera system or have an SFPD officer stand patrol near the mural to catch the people doing this?   No chance. Waste of money
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,CivetSeattle,6,Wed Jul 1 16:55:24 2015 UTC,They actually set up a camera after it was vandalized the first time.  SFPD is just keeping the videos under wrap.
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,kschang,2,Wed Jul 1 17:24:39 2015 UTC,Drones... with dye paintball guns. The same kind of dye you put in those bank bags that goes POOF. ;)
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,dboy999,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:13:06 2015 UTC,"i thought they already put in cameras.  and you cant post a cop there, its a waste of time and money considering that if the assholes see them they wont do anything. so then how long do you keep the cop there? and when theyre gone, theyll do it again"
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,openzeus,6,Wed Jul 1 16:20:00 2015 UTC,What if they paint the cop's uniform so he blends into the mural so that vandals don't see him?
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,I_AMA_IRONMAN,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:44:55 2015 UTC,Then I suppose they would set the officer on fire
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,notappropriateatall,3,Wed Jul 1 17:13:48 2015 UTC,If not a cop then maybe Batman?
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,dvidsilva,2,Wed Jul 1 16:55:58 2015 UTC,"Rad at his instagram, the guy is not anti-gay or whatever, they're just upset because that's a very traditional neighborhood.  ""Stop trying to force your values on us. Would you like it if we put a traditional family values mural in the Castro? How would that be received?""  He also complains that while a lot of churches are being vandalized and there's a lot of violence around there that is never reported or investigated, while a printed piece of paper gets all the coverage.  I might take his side on this, there are way more important things in SF to be worried about than a piece of paper in a wall."
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,Kraam,2,Wed Jul 1 18:10:07 2015 UTC,"Traditional? As in gays traditionally being  beaten, burned, stoned, gassed and generally being treated as subhumans?   The churches got tagged because they have a wall not because the vandals are anti catholic."
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,MacroMeez,2,Thu Jul 2 21:59:54 2015 UTC,"yeah after reading this i feel pretty torn on the whole issue.  The mural was put up by people from an entirely different city, not even just a different neighborhood.  ""sukkafreetone@barrio2barrio this shit has got me genuinely pissed off, they have an online donation page for the replacement, but still no date for the community forum/meeting.""  it sounds like no one asked the actual people of the community if they wanted it there.  A lot of the response to the recent rulings have felt like a ""ha ha we win you lose"" thing that honestly is just going to cause more animosity.  Going into a conservative neighborhood and putting up a gay mural that no one there asked for is certainly not going to add harmony."
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,dvidsilva,0,Wed Jul 1 18:24:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is supposed to be a place where we can all express our opinions and everyone is respected.   Demanding more respect for one group or another can lead to conflicts we don't need."
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,DINKDINK,2,Wed Jul 1 18:33:19 2015 UTC,Are you claiming that threats against people's free speech is good?
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,dvidsilva,0,Wed Jul 1 20:10:34 2015 UTC,ah?
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,DINKDINK,7,Wed Jul 1 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"Putting up art is speech, Supporting aggression towards that is threatening free speech."
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,Kovnerbielski,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:44:04 2015 UTC,It's almost like when white people complained about black people interpreting their traditionally white neighborhood.  It's not any better just because the bigot happens to be brown.
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,deadfermata,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:07:34 2015 UTC,Put cameras up. Not MUNI ones as those probably don't even work. Vandalism is Vandalism.
sanfrancisco,3bqt3r,b_m_hart,-8,Wed Jul 1 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"I love the fact that they burned the two faggots, cuz that's wrong. However, they left the two chicks - cuz that's hawt, amirite?"
sanfrancisco,3bt4rf,vader540is,8,Wed Jul 1 22:51:56 2015 UTC,"No, that's a crash. Nothing alleged about it."
sanfrancisco,3bt4rf,asherrd,0,Thu Jul 2 05:59:00 2015 UTC,That's the joke?
sanfrancisco,3bt4rf,trentblase,3,Thu Jul 2 22:53:44 2015 UTC,3rd and Fitzgerald. Dui driver crashed into street sign. Pedestrian tried to help the driver out of the car...the suspect got out of the car and assaulted the Pedestrian trying to help her... then ran off stumbling down 3rd...fell twice... Then ran back  to get her night train & purse.... Just another day in HP.
sanfrancisco,3bt4rf,caliform,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:54:27 2015 UTC,Fucking horrendous. I hope whoever it is that they get their license taken permanently. I'm glad nobody died.
sanfrancisco,3bq09m,kstew4eva,11,Wed Jul 1 05:37:16 2015 UTC,"I live in (lower) pac heights. One thing that's crazy is how many high-end houses are unoccupied. It follows that if you can buy a place that costs $8m (plus $80k/yr property taxes and who knows what in upkeep/renovations) odds are you have a house in Aspen, another one in Dubai, another one in NYC etc so you probably only go to your SF place a couple times a year, you just hire a caretaker to keep it looking good.   Maybe the caretakers sleep there? I'd like to think so. It just seems wrong that no one's waking up in the bedrooms with the best views in the city."
sanfrancisco,3bq09m,eyeclaudius,4,Wed Jul 1 18:30:53 2015 UTC,"It's actually far more likely that the house has been in the family for generations and they're paying barely any property tax on it - maybe renting it out occasionally, mostly just waiting for it to appreciate so they can sell and split up the proceeds.   Check the latest tax assessments on some of these houses - they're publicly available."
sanfrancisco,3bq09m,sfthrow87,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:56:06 2015 UTC,BF lives in this neighborhood too and we are always amazed how many times the houses have no lights on. It's super rare to ever see any one home or any lights on.
sanfrancisco,3bq09m,jwkm,-1,Wed Jul 1 23:20:48 2015 UTC,I hope one day people will be comfortable with with co op housing that awesome homes like this could be shared by a group that would appreciate it.
sanfrancisco,3bq09m,lunartree,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:23:24 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of people that are down with co-op housing and plenty of people wealthy enough to live in places like this, even with roommates. There just isn't much overlap of the two."
sanfrancisco,3bq09m,IHateShaneBattier,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:01:03 2015 UTC,"Traditionally, no. However, I could certainly see millennials and future generations eventually enjoying the idea. If you're young and not married it might make sense to go for housing with some communal aspects because it means everyone can enjoy something far higher quality than any individual would be able to afford, and there's a lot of value in the social atmosphere."
sanfrancisco,3bq09m,lunartree,4,Tue Jul 7 06:58:56 2015 UTC,TIL where I want to live when I have several million to spend on a house.
sanfrancisco,3bq09m,Cricket620,8,Wed Jul 1 14:59:12 2015 UTC,Correction:  Tens of millions ;)   and then a ridiculous sum every year in property taxes!
sanfrancisco,3bq09m,hobbnet,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:18:51 2015 UTC,Pac Heights contains Billionaire's Row. He will need a lot more to fit in with that crowd.
sanfrancisco,3bq09m,Unhelpful_Scientist,4,Wed Jul 1 19:11:24 2015 UTC,Looks like these pics were taken in 70s with that color
sanfrancisco,3bq09m,ghettobacon,2,Wed Jul 1 15:22:32 2015 UTC,cityporn the first one. nice shot!
sanfrancisco,3bq09m,BosSF82,2,Wed Jul 1 16:13:59 2015 UTC,"Some really nice pics in that set!  I used to work in Pac Heights and ride in on my motorcycle to get there. Beautiful architecture aside from a few silly modern houses. Surprised not to see the Doubtfire House, not that it is necessary, just that so many people shoot it. I worked right by it and tours and people were always coming by to see it."
sanfrancisco,3bq09m,VictorianPornStar,2,Wed Jul 1 14:27:13 2015 UTC,"Wow. That was like a walking tour of the neighborhood in which I grew up. You missed a few cool things though, like the river stone street (Broderick @ Vallejo), and the secret Presidio gate at the end of Broadway. Not a huge deal.  Great tour anyway."
