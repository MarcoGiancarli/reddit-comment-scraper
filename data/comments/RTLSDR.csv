RTLSDR,3dzn3s,dafunk60,3,Mon Jul 20 20:44:05 2015 UTC,I built this simple tool for use with my HackRF but it should work with any SDR supported by SDR Console.  Although it is probably not necessary if Unitrunker supports your SDR directly.  This application will allow Unitrunker to control multiple SDR Console VFO's. Perhaps someone will find this useful. Enjoy!

RTLSDR,3dzf06,CactusEU,2,Mon Jul 20 19:47:45 2015 UTC,"Google ""collinear antenna"" There's plenty of online calculators and designs out there."
RTLSDR,3dzf06,moogintroll,2,Mon Jul 20 20:42:42 2015 UTC,"Fully general procedure for retuning any antenna design:   Find the ratio of the designed wavelength to your wanted wavelength. Use the same ratio to scale the design.   (To check you did it the right way around: higher frequency = shorter wavelength = smaller antenna.)  For your case we get 144/170 ≈ 0.85, so multiply all the dimensions by that and build.  Caveat: In order for this to truly work, you have to scale all dimensions. But the diameter of the coax is fixed, so you won't get exactly the ideal result."
RTLSDR,3dzf06,kpreid,3,Mon Jul 20 21:50:41 2015 UTC,"Hello. This is the FBK 2/70 (mysterious) antenna. I'ts a derivate of the Townsman and the J-Pole antenna. You can find a easy  calculator for the J-Pole or Slim-Jim (it's almost the same-it is basically a 2m antenna with extentions). See here : http://www.m0ukd.com/calculators/slim-jim-and-j-pole-calculator/  I dit much tests with the FBK 2/70, and he has more peaks than 144MHz and 440MHz. I have a VNA diagram of it. If you do NOT sending on this antenna, he has very good receiving from 100MHz to 600MHz and higher, and it is no must to place him on a high position.

RTLSDR,3druuz,MastersInDisasters,3,Sun Jul 19 11:20:45 2015 UTC,"Then it's not RFI from your computer!  It still could be RFI, but it seems very structured.  This could even be an overload of the front end of the SDR receiver and you're getting an image from somewhere else.  From your post history, you're Dutch, and I'm assuming that you're in the Netherlands, so I can't help much with what SHOULD be at that frequency.  From a quick look on this page, it sure does look a lot like an LTR signal, and the sound seems similar, except the pitch(? tone?) is off, which could be explained with the recording in Wide-band FM mode.  I am confused by the frequency 424.812461, as it does not appear to be ""standard"" (at least in the U.S., and I am pretty sure that the bands are divided up the same way:  100KHz, 50KHz, 25KHz, 12.5KHz, 6.25KHz, etc.), so check to make sure the SDR ppm is set correctly.  If everything is set and this is correct, it's likely an image from a nearby transmitter, and I see this more at the edge of the display for whatever reason.  Since it's strong enough though, try running a decoder for LTR on it and see what happens."
RTLSDR,3druuz,MastersInDisasters,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:54:13 2015 UTC,I found a pdf with Dutch frequencies. It's probably a trunking signal. Do you know any software that i could use to decode it?

RTLSDR,3dsnpc,singaporetheory,2,Sun Jul 19 01:58:32 2015 UTC,you need a telescopic antenna with magnet foot. like this one. So you can adjust the correct /4 lambda for each frequency. this gives you best results.   http://www.winradio.com/home/ax06b.htm
RTLSDR,3dsnpc,pit0711,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:46:28 2015 UTC,"That's a magnetic mount ground plane antenna. You can use it, but it won't give you the best performance unless you have a sheet of metal to put under it (like a car roof, or a non-aluminum pie pan, or a file cabinet, toolbox, ...). And if your dongle came with one of the nicer telescoping antennas that NooElec's do these days, you basically already have one.  I used this one, ProComm JBC180M3 stuck on random metal bits for a while and it served me well. It also has a standard 3/8""-24 screw joining the whip to the base, and the whip itself is fastened with a setscrew, so if I wanted I could reuse the base with a different length element (just a piece of stiff wire cut to length). Unfortunately, it seems to be discontinued. (Not that I did a thorough evaluation — I just bought something cheap off Amazon.)  The one you linked apparently has loading coils (the lumps in the middle) which means it'll do better at the specific bands it's been designed for, but its overall performance across the entire range will be worse than a plain whip.  For reliable standalone performance, you want an antenna which has “both halves” in a single unit — vertical dipole (tricky to mount), j-pole, discone, or one with radials/ground plane built in (look for a circle of horizontal elements sticking out of the base)."

They seem to have gotten a bad rap in some circles, and I think that was just the result of an unwise decision by Michael Ossman who seems to have been under pressure on some level to bundle what appears to have been a really crappy screw on one piece antenna.  If people just thought about the problem they would realize that a HackRF cant be beat in terms of flexibility at almost any price.  The addition of a few inline filters to your toolkit can work wonders.   The HackRF itself is capable of a lot more than an RTLSDR and in many respects the receiver is better. They both suffer from a number of image issues and issues related to the 8 bit design. the same interventions help both of them a lot. The interventions are quite simple and the parts needed to do them cheap so it does not take much work to get a lot more performance."

RTLSDR,3d3jzc,kabincruzer,2,Mon Jul 13 06:12:01 2015 UTC,"You have Analog checked on the voice role VCO but the audio output path is set to ""Unspecified"". If you want to hear analog calls, point this to your speakers.  You appear to be running release 30. Consider upgrading to release 31. You will likely need to reconfigure your receivers."
RTLSDR,3d3jzc,unitrunker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:30:09 2015 UTC,"I just left the other options as their default since I'm trying to decode P25 anyhow. And I used release 30 because of the small changes to the UI there aren't too many guides out there yet using the newest release. If it helps at all my location is Columbus GA and I'm trying to listen to Muscogee Regional Commnications System. Based on manually toying with the channels as they pop up in SDR#, I assume they use P25? I appreciate your help!"
RTLSDR,3d3jzc,unitrunker,2,Mon Jul 13 06:43:48 2015 UTC,Looking further - the waveform is very fuzzy. On the voice role RTL stick ...   turn on baseband AGC. turn off auto gain. adjust the manual gain value up or down as needed (try values between 250 to 500). tweak the correction value.   DSD+ (and P25 decoding in general) is particularly sensitive to slightly mistuned waveforms.
RTLSDR,3d3jzc,leader2november,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:40:00 2015 UTC,Still no dice. I do notice that the signal receiver does regularly listen on an alternate control frequency but I assume that is normal?
RTLSDR,3d3jzc,rtlsdrblog,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:58:59 2015 UTC,"Just park on 852.1125 for your control channel. Now one of the issues you are going to find with the Muscogee Regional Communications system is that the channels are so damn far apart it isn't funny. You will see that the control is in the 852MHZ range and the ""talking"" happens up in the 855/856 range. That is pretty wide for RTLSDR dongles unless you are running multiple dongles and set it up for one to serve as signal and one (or more) to serve as your voice decode."
RTLSDR,3d3jzc,rtlsdrblog,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:30:11 2015 UTC,All else aside: If I have kinda shoddy antennas could that be an issue in unitrunker? I noticed I can manually browse for communications in SDR# and generally pick up what they say but I wonder does Unitrunker have a need for better antennas?   Also I'm never opposed to scrapping my work and starting anew if you have a better guide?
RTLSDR,3d3jzc,leader2november,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:06:44 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it's unencrypted P25?  I suggest that you test it first by changing your voice receiver to output audio to your speakers, and listen and see if Unitrunker is correctly tuning to your P25 signals with good reception when a call comes in."
RTLSDR,3d3jzc,unitrunker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:51:16 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's not just based on the fact that I can manually browse the spectrum in sdr# and decode the messages that way. And when i listen to the direct signal it's that standard static tone type sound of a control signal. If it were actually encrypted would dsd+ not make an attempt at decoding as it seems to be doing?
RTLSDR,3d3jzc,unitrunker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:53:31 2015 UTC,So when you pipe the P25 signal audio from SDR# into DSD+ with Virtual Audio Cable it works fine as in DSD+ produces voice audio and text scrolls?
