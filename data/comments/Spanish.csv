There are four books I think, focusing on short, easy-to-digest tales from different Spanish-speaking regions (Mexico, Spain, Puerto Rico, and Latin America). Each story has English on one side and Spanish on the other. At C1, I found the Spanish a bit too easy, so for B2 it should be just right. It is labeled as Intermediate. Sorry, my Internet is being stupid right now so I can't post a link but I'll try to post one later if you can't find it."

Spanish,3e4jee,-Obito-,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:44:00 2015 UTC,"My Spanish tutor has me reading La lección de August - R.J. Palacio. She felt that it was a good option for me as it includes some slang, some conversational dialogue and a variety of vocabulary focusing on day-to-day situations and resulting emotions. The book was originally written in English, but translated into Spanish. I'm halfway through it and struggled slightly at first but am enjoying it now and really using it as a challenge to learn new vocabulary and improve my sentence structure.   It is a longer book at close to 400 pages but the chapters are 2-6 pages each (guesstimation) that allows me to easily digest each part of the story."

Spanish,3e4jee,bearsinthesea,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:11:23 2015 UTC,"I always found it easier to read translated versions of books I had already read when I was starting out. Hemingway and Steinbeck translations are pretty easy to tackle, especially if you're already familiar with the story. However, the first book I ever read cover to cover in Spanish was Yo Soy El Diego de la Gente ""by"" Diego Maradona. As a huge Boca Juniors fan (and fan of Argentine futbol in general) I found it enjoyable but since it's a futbol autobiography, the prose is fairly easy to follow.  I guess the most important thing when picking something to read in a new language is choose something you're genuinely interested in. It makes a lot easier to stick with it when it gets tough.  Edit: Just noticed the ""anything interesting about Spain"" part. I read Por quien doblan las campanas (For Whom the Bell Tolls)  and Fiesta (The Sun Also Rises) by Ernest Hemingway when I was first starting to read in Spanish. They are both excellent books set in Spain that deal with a decent amount of Spanish culture/history."

Spanish,3e077v,ludable,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:31:52 2015 UTC,"Traer can also be used with the meaning of carry in many circumstances. The same happens in English: you can say ""I always bring a needle with me"", or ""I always carry a needle with me"".  In the case of this particular sentence, I would understand what you mean, although I would think that perhaps you only bring the needle here as opposed to carrying it everywhere. Very subtle difference and not a major problem.  Now, there's a mistake there that could be your transcribing (or not): ""Siempre traigo una aguja en caso de emergencia.""  You write un águila but una aguja. The difference is that the a in aguja is not stressed."

Also, it's not that all the Spanish speaking people from Paraguay use leísmo, and it's not used consistently either across all the people who use it:   Desde el punto de vista diastrático, el leísmo paraguayo, tal como lo he descrito, se encuentra en los isolectos más distanciados de la norma lingüística regional en la  totalidad de sus registros orales y escritos, y en los isolectos medios y superiores en los registros orales fundamentalmente (aunque también se dan casos en el registro escrito) y en circunstancias preferentemente no formales si bien, en ocasiones formales, se pueden encontrar también casos de leísmo, sobre todo referidos a sustantivos caracterizados por las notas (+humano) (+ animado) y (+ singular).   Origen y formación del leísmo en el español del Paraguay. Ensayo de un método,  Germán de Granda (1982)  I mean, there is leísmo in Paraguay, but it's not the same as the well-known leísmo from Spain. If you were to take leísmo from Paraguay into this conversation, there should be a lot more of examples that the ones given by /u/-Obito-, and probably would confuse OP unnecessarily, unless they target specifically Spanish from Paraguay.

Teníamos que manejar el coche hasta otra ciudad una hora para comprar materiales con que construir y el jefe me preguntó si quisiera conducir. Nos tomó dos horas y luego comimos una media hora. Después quedaron tres horas del día para trabajar. Y en esas horas, sí que hice bien mi trabajo como hago todo que me dan.

Ya había trabajado, pero me dio 300 coronas en lugar de 600. Igor decidió eso porque estrellé el coche que conducí y también porque no trabajé más de tres horas en el sitio aunque yo y Igor manejamos para comprar materiales y tal una mitad del día. No tengo una licencia y mis jefes lo sabían, pero me dejaron conducir de todos modos. Y además, nuestro acuerdo es un sueldo de 70 coronas a la hora o 600 al día. Por eso, no importa lo que haga, lo importante es que esté allí y que ayude, y eso lo hice.  Me dijo que a pesar de no trabajar todo el día en el sitio y de chocar el coche, me daría 300. Dijo que los otros tipos hacen más que yo y el otro chico con quien trabajaba, pero no era nuestra culpa que no logramos mucho ese día, era la de Igor, quien no planificó bien el día. Llevábamos casi todo el día comprando lo que nos faltó y no soy culpable de eso. Ni hasta quería él discutirlo, como si supiera que tuviera razón.

The spanish is different from that of Latin America but you definitely will learn and improve in speaking and writing. 10/10 would recommend going to study there!  Also if you went to a study abroad program school they would have classes entirely in spanish that you could take. Its not as intense as a full on spanish university.

Es recomendable que acudas a la embajada española local o te pongas en contacto con ellos para hacer esto ya que aqui no podemos guiarte en como hacer este paso y alli tendran algo de experiencia al respecto probablemente.

Siempre pensé que las clases se limitaban a la ciudad, pero me alegra saber que no es el caso.   ¿La prueba de acceso a la Universidad sería equivalente al SAT? Me pondré en contacto con el ministerio.  Verdaderamente agradezco toda esta información. Hoy estaré por nueva york así que haré de ir a la embajada. Gracias :D"

Spanish,3dwfsm,Good_Eatin,6,Mon Jul 20 02:34:59 2015 UTC,"Sure, in general I think it's very good. Your spelling and sentence structure seem to be perfect in most cases. Here are a few grammar mistakes I saw:   Está una noche muy hermosa   Here ""hermosa"" is an attribute of the night. Check again which verb you should use at the beginning   ¡Tendremos la boda de sus sueños!   Think about ""sus"" and to what person it is referring to. Which pronoun should you use. My hint is to remember that you are talknig from Esteban's point of view directly to Shakira,   ¡Tan caro como quieras!   ""Caro"" is referring to a noun you used just before. What gender is this noun? Should you change the adjective?   ""¿!Quién es esto?!""   You are referring to a person. In Spanish in phrases like this you can't use esto, you have to use él or ella.   Esteban: ¡Eres malo!   Esteban says this to Karina, who is a woman. The adjective should correspond in gender.   Tienes que ámame   I don't know how to explain it but ir should be ""Tienes que amarme"" using the infinitive   Tómalo atrás   This is a direct translation of ""take it back"". I suggest that you look up equivalent phrases in Spanish since this one doesn't work."

Shakira: ¿Prométemelo? or ¿me lo prometes?  Esteban: !¡Pensé que estabas muerta!  Shakira: ¿!Quién es esta?!  or ella instead.  ¡Pensé que ella murió en un accidente de un globo aerostático!  (Has no mistakes, but it's so unnatural). Maybe ¡Pensé que ella había muerto en un accidente en un globo aerostático!  Karina: ¿Me recuerdas, ah? Entonces, ¿por qué te tienes una novia nueva?   Karina: ¿!Por qué ya no me amas todavía!? (not sure what she wants to say).  Karina abofetea a Esteban   Esteban: ¿Por qué me mentiste miénteme? ¿Por qué te reapareces para darme problemas por en mi relación?   Karina: ¡Porque nos pertenecemos juntos el uno al otro! ¡Tú nueva novia es un problema!   Esteban: ¡Ella no lo es!   Karina: Yo sé cómo arreglarlo.   De repente, Karina dispara *a *Shakira   Esteban: ¡Eres mala! ¡Eres una bruja que volvió de entre los muertos!  maybe despiadada instead of mala.  Karina: (...) ¡Tienes que ámame! or ¡Tienes que amarme!   Esteban: ¡No, no te amo! !Ahora creo que te odio!   Karina: ¡Tómalo atrás! (???) You mean like take it back? That would be... ¡retráctate!

If you can learn about the subjunctive and more vocab from books or the internet, then you don't need a teacher. However, be very careful about turning your friends into teachers. Also, don't be surprised if they cannot explain the rules to you. Most native speakers cannot.   Use  your friends/native speakers for vocab and your teacher for the subjunctive.

That'll let you not only catch the accent but also learn about the reality of the country before getting there.  Telenovelas are fine too, but you need to know that they're not nearly as big in Spain as in America, to the point that many of the telenovelas in Spanish TV come from Venezuela or Mexico (at least that was the case when I used to live there).  Wikipedia has a listing https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Canales_de_televisi%C3%B3n_en_Espa%C3%B1a of Spanish networks, just look the websites and most of them have free video on demand.  Also, depending on which part of Spain the accent can vary dramatically. E.g. if you're going to Andalucía you really really want to watch Canal Sur to get the accent, while if you're going to Madrid watching TeleMadrid is better to get acquainted with the city, etc."

Spanish,3dsd2f,blakeh36,10,Sun Jul 19 00:10:04 2015 UTC,"Okay so generally people make the outlook sound pretty damn bleak for a person to learn but I promise it IS possible. I couldn't for a few years, then this year, I just could. So it's possible and don't forget that. My biggest help was listening to spanish music and sing along!! At first, I could actually only roll my tongue while singing (horribly might I add), but I could. I would sing all the time and practice every single day in the shower. Don't think too hard about it. The more you listen to people doing it and just generally speak trying to pronounce things correctly, you should get there. I believe there are also a few tongue twisters to practice (I'm on mobile now, but if you're interested I remember one abour a ""perro"" that I'm sure I could find.) Keep trying!!!"
Spanish,3dsd2f,eatscheeerios,4,Sun Jul 19 00:52:14 2015 UTC,"right? usually when I ask people, they always say ""just say arrrrrrrrriba, and there you go"", which is incredibly frustrating. Thanks, I've been listing to things in Spanish, but not very often. I'll be sure to do it more. Thanks!"
Spanish,3dsd2f,eatscheeerios,3,Sun Jul 19 02:33:36 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! If you're unsure of where to start, listening to music in spanish does NOT have to be all mariachi and daddy-yankee type pop, so don't get caught in that trap unless that's what you're into. In /r/spanish there are quite a few posts about music, so check 'em out and I replied to another comment with a few of my favorite bands."
Spanish,3dsd2f,riverloves2dance,2,Sun Jul 19 08:49:41 2015 UTC,Could you recommend a few artists? I love singing as a way of learning a language and I'm always on the look out for new music.
Spanish,3dsd2f,eatscheeerios,3,Sun Jul 19 07:12:28 2015 UTC,"Of course! I think my favorite is Zoé, a mexican group that I would describe as sort of alternative-y with a little bit of electronic sound. Their MTV unplugged album is straight up genius. When I first listened to them, I actually didn't really love it, so don't write them off after just one song if you aren't impressed. Here's two of my favorites: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tEePqzckTAY and https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JyM5ogDABqk If you're more into a pop sound, I'd suggest Plastilina Mosh. They are also Mexican (my best friend is from Matamoros so I tend to know more Mexican artists than anything else) and they have some very interesting lyrics... I'll let you listen for yourself. Some of their songs are half in English and half in Spanish, which is fun, while others are just Spanish. My favorites: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mN292c5y4cE and https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zE7woxcB35s. Back to more of an alternative sound, there's Panda. They're again, Mexican, and have a little bit of a more grungy  (not necessarily Nirvana-type, just rougher) sound, but have clever lyrics and fantastic guitar. In relation to learning to roll your tongue, I would credit these guys the most. They're great to sing along to once you get the hang of it. Bonus: the lead singer is pretty cute! Here are my two favorites from them: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CF72RkHcKqs and https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tTZ18m4W3gY  Similar to Panda, although with a very distinct voice is División Minúscula. They're pretty solid rock, and like I mentioned, the lead singer's voice is pretty unique. Also Mexican! Again' my favorites: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DVBgt4vYGPU (this one is really fun on guitar if you play!) and https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=luZz40sD0qQ Now, for something a little different, there is Chilean band, Kudai. With a male and female singer, they were another one that I wasn't 100% sure of at first, but ended up loving. Their sound is pretty distinct as well, sort of a pop alternative if that can be a thing. Hard to describe, but have a listen: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HxuR6HeLVO8 and https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yAkoQxjDfp8 I could go on forever, but I'll leave you with one last artist. This band has a female singer and is once again, Mexican. They employ a variety of sounds and I really love the lyrics to their songs. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K88rVosLMVE and https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O2hBcocaFvw Sorry that the formatting of this post is a little crazy-- like I said, I'm on my phone, so it does weird things.

The other night I was going through this thread super frustrated because as a kid it was so easy for me and then I got four teeth removed and braces. I haven't been able to roll my r's since. Well, at least not when I'm trying to it seems. Some words like ""perro"" and ""arriba"" (reading this thread ha) are really hard. I feel like I'm making weird faces just to say some words. I definitely can't do a long rolling r.  I'd be interested if you happen to find the tongue twisters."
Spanish,3dsd2f,eatscheeerios,2,Sun Jul 19 20:32:31 2015 UTC,"The first two from here are specifically for rolling your r's and I quite like them. The other ones on that site are also good for other pronunciation help as well, so be sure to check them out. I like this one because it has a few different versions so you can say whichever feels most natural to you.  This site also has a few. Some are the same, but there are a few different ones.  At first, yes, you're going to be thinking about it as you say them (and like we've both mentioned, it doesn't really happen when you're thinking about it too hard), but I would pick one or two, memorize them, and just say them to yourself over and over until you don't have to think about it. Then you might have better luck, and you'll know some cool Spanish trabalenguas!"
Spanish,3dsd2f,AmIaMuppet,2,Sun Jul 19 20:47:52 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness, the ones in the first link are ""terrible"" hahaha! In all seriousness though, thank you.  That second site I think might have helped pin point something for me. It's a lot easier to do the DR for me so I think really doing that particular exercise might help. Really a struggle to do the words beginning ""tr"" or just ""r""  or when it's smack in the middle without that little warm up.  Muchas Gracias!"
Spanish,3dsd2f,eatscheeerios,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:04:58 2015 UTC,"De nada :)  I have the same problem with the getting it right at the beginning, I usually have to already be speaking for a while to do it. Just keep on practicing, like you said. You'll get it!"
Spanish,3dsd2f,noanoita,2,Sun Jul 19 21:08:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for giving me some hope.  I'm a native speaker but I grew up in the US and could never roll my 'r'.  I listen to a lot of Spanish music and sing along all the time.  I was so excited the last time the 'r' came out naturally, without me trying, so I'm hoping it'll happen again and more often."
Spanish,3dsd2f,Spitalian,5,Mon Jul 20 02:13:11 2015 UTC,"If it sounds like a machine gun, it's probably because you're not voicing it. Sounds are either voiced (like a z sound) or unvoiced (like an s sound). With voiced sounds, your vocal cords vibrate. Put your hand on your throat and pronounce a long z sound. You should feel your vocal cords vibrating. Now try to do the same thing while you vibrate your tongue.   Also, make sure the tip of your tongue is vibrating on the ridge behind your teeth (where you pronounce a t or a d), but not on your teeth themselves.  After that, you mostly just have to practice a lot. Try saying the rolled r before and after the 5 Spanish vowels. Some vowels make it harder to roll your r's in my experience. Here's an exercise to get you started:  arrá arré arró arrí arrú   errá erré erró errí errú   orrá orré orró orrí orrú   irrá irré irró irrí irrú   urrá urré urró urrí urrú"
Spanish,3dsd2f,Spitalian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:09:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I should have specified, but I am making a tone while I'm vibrating my tongue. when I do it, it sounds a bit like I'm saying the 'z' sound while I vibrate my tongue. Thanks for the exercises. I tried them and it already seems to be helping a bit!"

Spanish,3dsd2f,Esterlwf,8,Sun Jul 19 02:32:38 2015 UTC,"I'm by no means an expert, but when I was taking Spanish 1 in High School, the teacher gave us a short little exercise to try. Not everyone got it but I found it to be helpful.  What the teacher had us do was practice saying the sentence ""put it away"" faster and faster, while slowly slurring it together and emphasizing the t sounds. The teacher told us not to focus on it too hard, but just go for it. It started sounding like ""put di da way"" and ""puddiddaway"" until all the d's were going fast enough to get a short trill and after a bit of practice with the feeling people started getting it.  I don't know if this will help any more than what you've already tried or what people have already suggested, but it was a little different and useful to me. Anyway, good luck!"
Spanish,3dsd2f,Leyetipants,3,Sun Jul 19 04:01:37 2015 UTC,This reminds me of Red Hot Chili Peppers's give it away where the singer says it so fast he gets a trill. I don't know but it could help trying it.
Spanish,3dsd2f,RojastheImmigrnt,3,Sun Jul 19 17:24:02 2015 UTC,"Gringo who learned Spanish a few years ago here. The best trick I ever picked up was to practice reciting Spanish from a book or something with a stick or pen in your mouth, so that your tongue has to press against it when you speak. This will strengthen your tongue muscles, as well as help you find the muscles you need to better control your tongue."
Spanish,3dsd2f,Sydarsin,2,Sun Jul 19 04:10:13 2015 UTC,"What helped me get it right was whenever you have a hard word or wanna pronounce the 'r' sound in spanish just take in a breath beforehand and as you say the word breathe out, keep practicing that a few times and it should work (it did for me at least). I was taught that by someone who had helped 5 other exchange students learn spanish. hope that works!"
Spanish,3dsd2f,BlissteredFeat,2,Sun Jul 19 05:14:40 2015 UTC,"Hi! It took me about a year to learn how to roll my r's. Until one day, I sat down for a few hours and I decided ""I'm going to figure this out.""  I looked up some wiki how's with a simple Google search, and I tried to do exactly what they said.  When I first started to figure it out, i started to roll at the back of my tongue (which sounds disgusting) and I eventually figured out how to move it up over the next few hours.   I wish I could give you one definitive tip to figure it out, but there are so many variables and I couldn't tell you what you're doing wrong even if we met in person.   I guess my two cents is sit down and really try to hash it out. And if your attempt doesn't work, just try to move your mouth differently and see if it helps.   Good luck! And it certainly IS possible"
Spanish,3dsd2f,GirlNumber20,2,Sun Jul 19 16:11:40 2015 UTC,"It's tricky.  One of the best things I learned is to relax the tongue, which is difficult because the tongue also has to be lifted into the right position.  The tip of the tongue should be anywhere from just behind the teeth to just touching the back of the upper gum (that's where it is for me). Play around with that position. If it's beginning to flap, I suggest just letting air flow over it without voicing it and just let the tongue relax as much as possible while still getting a trill.  If it's too stiff you won't trill, too relaxed and the tongue rests in the bottom of your mouth. You'll find a sweet spot, and then practice it. Relentlessly.  The other thing is that the rr is easier to say at the beginning of a syllable than the end, which is actually how syllables are divided in Spanish.  In other words, it's easier to say bu rro than burr o.  Mouthing the vowel followed by the rr distorts the ability to trill. But I think most English speakers naturally try to do the latter.  I couldn't roll my rr for years. Then I was going to move to Mexico and decided I had better learn.  I drove a newspaper truck at the time, and so had lots of time to practice.  I started my shift just trying to say bu rro any way I could.  By the end of 8 hours of driving I had it down. The nice thing about practicing when driving is that you can't concentrate too much, but you can get an enormous amount of automatic repetitions.  Sounds weird but it works--also like practicing scales on guitar while watching TV."
Spanish,3dsd2f,luzdelalunallena,2,Sun Jul 19 17:37:49 2015 UTC,"This is entirely unhelpful, but I was born knowing how to do this.  Literally.  My mom said when I'd cry, it went like, ""Wahhhh...R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R!""  Apparently, she'd get stares/laughs when she took me out in public.  So I'm sorry, I can't tell you any tricks, but I just want to say, practice!  Practice a lot, by yourself, so you don't feel self-conscious.  Pretend to be a cat trying to purr.  I know you said you've been trying for a year, but it's going to click one of these days.  Keep trying different techniques until the magic happens.  ¡Buena suerte!"

Spanish,3dsd2f,ReachForTheSkyline,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:02:20 2015 UTC,this is the only thing that really taught me how to do it.   you know when you're sick with a sore throat and you rub your glands to see if they're swollen?  touch those spots and just try to do it. those are the muscles that vibrate when you roll your r's.
Spanish,3dsd2f,ryloc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:58:04 2015 UTC,"Okay so you say you rest your tongue on the bottom of your mouth when you say the single R and I think that is indeed your problem.   The best way I've heard the Spanish R described is the ""dd"" in ""ladder"" or the ""t"" sounds when we say ""put it on"". Tongue needs to be up in the top of your mouth.   I actually just learned how to roll my Rs over the past week and the way I did it is that I would find a word with RR that I knew I could say pretty well (for me it was ""error"") and repeat that word over and over again until I thought I had it perfect. Then I would switch the vowel sounds around RR to something else (from error to arror to arrar to arrir) just to practice the different tongue positions/mouth formations that are needed. Then just throw these imaginary words into sentences and practice them at speed.   Hope this helps! Suerte!"

My grandfather once sat my uncle for a good 4 hours practice of:  Erré con erré, cigarro. Erré con erré, barril. Qué rapido corren los carros del ferrocarril.  I remember it took me about 2 years to finally get my 'R's. All you have to do try and try, and one day you'll do it. Then you just have to try to repeat what you did and practice practice practice. Remember one thing, if it isn't sounding like it should, move your tongue around try something different. ""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over, but expecting different results"".

Spanish,3dssh7,stargrunt6,3,Sun Jul 19 02:47:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say every country has their certain regions with difficult accents and dialects. I've met only a couple Hondurans, and they weren't too hard to talk to because they would ""put away"" their Honduran vocab and accent a bit, much like most everyone does when talking with someone not from your area, I think.  Just focus on neutral spanish, and talking with your families should give you all the slang and eccentricities from their regions =)"
Spanish,3dssh7,DownsetWithNothing,2,Sun Jul 19 17:24:13 2015 UTC,"Hey what a coincidence. I'm born in the US from Nicaraguan parents but lived all my life in Honduras.   Yeah, typically Hondurans speak with a lot of slang when talking in informal situations. The slang is very similar to the Salvadoran and shares a lot of words with other Central American slang. There's also Anglicisms, and Rio Platense, Mexican, and Puerto Rican influences. A lot of words I guess come from native languages , like Chirripa or Güaza/Waza (luck) Puchica (dammit) Purrunga (penis) Magayo (queer), or at least they sound like they do [Magayo definitely comes from Garifuna].  The thing you also have to understand is that Hondurans speak with a lot of play on words, like for example, ""Sebastian toda la bicicleta"" o ""Sebastian toda la vincha"" which translates to Spanish into ""Se va toda la vida"", a phrase that roughly means ""Of course I'd do it/her"". Words gets replaced but the sounds are the same or alliterations. One of our beers Salva Vida gets called Salvatore for example.  The good thing is that we are generally respectful and avoid using language people won't understand.   I don't know if you've heard this song before but it's all about Honduran slang. I can translate it if you request it, it wouldn't be any bother. There's also this nationally famous video about how Hondurans speak. I should say a few of the words aren't used like ""cheto"", it should be ""culo"". Those two videos covers all the basics.  My recommendation is to get conversational in Spanish. Since we do that thing about using words that sound the same as what we really mean, you have to have the vocabulary down. Also get exposed to some of the common slang words and sayings."
Spanish,3dssh7,Tutule,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:06:07 2015 UTC,"Oh and don't forget Honduras might be small but there are regional differences, some words might mean different things in different cities, also somethings might have different names. The best example I can think of quickly, of words with two meanings is ""rebanar"", in San Pedro Sula it means to have fun, joke around, or to make fun of; in Tegucigalpa it means to kiss, or make out. And for things called differently, a typical frozen treat is called topoyiyo in SPS and charamusca in Tegus, but I guess that's not slang."
Spanish,3dssh7,Tutule,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:36 2015 UTC,"Here in my Mexican city you can meet people from Central America on their way to the US and I have never thought Honduran Spanish (or any other CA variant) to be hard to understand. Again as DownsetWithNothing said, as long as people try to tone down the slang the language is the same so we have no problems understanding each other. I've never met someone from República Dominicana but I have no complains from the Cuban folk living in Mexico, in fact I find Cuban Spanish very Castizo and very charming."

Spanish,3dphm0,Realclock,12,Sat Jul 18 04:51:29 2015 UTC,"You may want to check a lesson or summary on Spanish accentuation. It's relatively easy but you need to learn it.  There are two main kinds of accents marks (there are more rules):   Accents that tell which syllable is stressed, e.g.: compro (COM-pro: I buy) vs compró (com-PRÓ: he/she bought) Accents that help us tell apart words that are written and pronounced the same but have different meanings, e.g.: te (pronoun) vs té (noun: tea).   This is a good explanation. I'll quote the most basic part:    Words that end in a vowel, -n, or -s stress the next-to-last syllable: clase, examen, mesas. Words that do not end in a vowel, -n, or -s, stress the last syllable: bondad, papel, cantar. Words that do not follow the above rules carry a written accent to show which syllable is stressed.    Just to be clear, 1 and 2 refer to words without accent marks."
Spanish,3dphm0,MistShinobi,0,Sat Jul 18 10:44:42 2015 UTC,"Accents that help us tell apart words that are written and pronounced the same but have different meanings, e.g.: te (pronoun) vs té (noun: tea).   Actually, all pairs of words like te/té are pronounced differently (one unstressed, the other stressed). Royal Academy decided to drop the solo/sólo (alone/only) difference because both words are pronounced the same. Now we should spell both as ""solo""."
Spanish,3dphm0,osnofla,2,Sun Jul 19 23:16:52 2015 UTC,"You are right, although this effort to ensure consistency is very recent and there are still a few exceptions (I imagine they will disappear since this has been the trend during the las 10-15 years). I still is ok to say that both words are pronounced to same when teaching accentuation, as this stress is more a matter of the sentence's prosody than the pronunciation of the words, and most teaching materials for foreigners make this simplification."
Spanish,3dphm0,MistShinobi,6,Mon Jul 20 09:11:20 2015 UTC,"If there's an accent, the stress is gonna fall on it always. If there's not, then it falls on the last-but-one syllable  (if the last letter is not ""n"", ""s"" or ""vowel"", then the accent is gone from the last one, but it still falls on it.)  So if you say ""compre"" the stress falls on ""com"".  If you say ""compré"", it falls on ""pré"".  If you say ""¿Quieres té?"" it falls both on ""Quie"" and ""té""."
Spanish,3dphm0,-Obito-,4,Sat Jul 18 05:10:31 2015 UTC,"If there's an accent, the stress is gonna fall on it always. If there's not, then it falls on the last-but-one syllable.   What if the word is stressed on the last syllable and it ends in a consonant other than N or S? What about ""comprar""?  You are very good at keeping it short and to the point (I beat around the bush too much), but even though syllable accentuation is relatively simple, you may need more than one sentence to explain it. :p"
Spanish,3dphm0,MistShinobi,2,Sat Jul 18 10:15:18 2015 UTC,"Ye, I guess I assumed OP would know the rules of accentuation for ""n s and vowel"", since he talked about stress haha."
Spanish,3dphm0,-Obito-,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:00:49 2015 UTC,"If a Spanish word ends in a consonant that is not s or n then the pronunciation rules (assuming there is no accent mark on the word) say that the final syllable is stressed (for example, ""papel"")  If it has an accent mark in any other syllable, then you emphasize that accented syllable (""cónsul"").  As someone stated earlier, the only time the Spanish language puts accent marks on syllables that are already the stressed syllable based on the pronunciation rules is when you have two different words pronounced and spelled the same way, in which case the accent mark lets you know which word is which (""té"" for tea versus ""te"" for you [as an object])."
Spanish,3dphm0,pinkgreenblue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"the only time the Spanish language puts accent marks on syllables that are already the stressed syllable based on the pronunciation rules is when you have two different words pronounced and spelled the same way   It's a little more complicated. Take for example mi(1) (musical note), mi(2) (possessive adjective) and mí (personal pronoun). mi(1) and mí are pronounced the same (stressed). mi(2) is pronounced differently (unstressed).  We have a pair of words like te/té or mi/mí if they are very common (not like musical notes) and they are pronounced differently: ""te"" is always unstressed and ""té"" is always stressed."
Spanish,3dphm0,osnofla,5,Sun Jul 19 23:23:10 2015 UTC,"The difference between compre and compré is the same as between the two meanings of English object: either ""What an attractive OBject!""  or ""I obJECT!""(except that in English the vowel sounds change a bit, too). Spanish just doesn't need to write an accent mark on the COMpre version because stress on that syllable is regular according to the rules of Spanish.  ¿Quieres té? would be sort of quiEres TE, where the E syllable of quieres is stressed because of the normal rules, and the TE syllable of té because the word has only one syllable. Plus, the pitch of your voice will be rising during the question."
Spanish,3dphm0,profeNY,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:39:14 2015 UTC,"Another thing I would add is that not every word is accentuated in a sentence. For instance, ""Quieres té?"" is, like you said, pronounced ""QuIEres tE"", but ""te quieres?"" (""do you love yourself?"") would be pronounced ""te quIEres"", without the word ""te"" being accentuated. So, of course the word ""te"" alone, would be accentuated, it will not happen when it appears in a sentence.  Normally, in sentences, only personal pronouns, substantives, verbs, adverbs and adjectives (did I miss anything? :3) are accentuated."
Spanish,3dphm0,enelsaxo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:58:01 2015 UTC,"To generalize, te (not té) is never stressed because it is a type of word called a ""clitic"", which is halfway between a word and a grammatical affix (prefix/suffix). Besides the absence of stress, clitics have limited syntactic distribution (only certain positions in a sentence). In Spanish all clitics are personal pronouns, but other languages have other types."
Spanish,3dphm0,profeNY,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:38:08 2015 UTC,"Ok so I only have one little thing about what was said about the intonation. While most dialects will show an rise in pitch at the end of the question, this is not always the case. This is especially true for the Caribbean varieties and even southern Spain and the Canary Islands. In these varieties the intonation may actually fall, which can be confusing for speakers of other dialects who, when asked, wait for you to get to the point haha.  Edit: To clarify I am talking about yes-no questions as in the example given ""¿Quieres té?"""
Spanish,3dphm0,NNNYES,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:57:16 2015 UTC,"That's not true. See my earlier post.  Porqué, porque, por qué, and por que are all different words.  For your one-syllable example, que and qué are different words, as are te and té. You're right that they are pronounced the same but they are not the same words."
Spanish,3dphm0,pinkgreenblue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:47:57 2015 UTC,"Té and te are not pronounced exactly the same. ""Te quiero"" is /te 'kjiero/ and ""té quiero"" is /'te 'kjiero/."
Spanish,3dphm0,osnofla,0,Sat Jul 18 18:16:06 2015 UTC,"If you say ""te"" without the accent, it sounds like a pronoun. People will first understand it as if you had said ""want yourself?""  A real difference would be ""Té, quieres?"" (tea, do you want some?) or ""te quieres?"" (do you love yourself?)"
Spanish,3dphm0,enelsaxo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:26:20 2015 UTC,"In some words, the accent is just there so you can tell apart homophones. Te and té, como and cómo, mi and mí, etc. Though I think in the case of te and té, te is never stressed while té normally is. Te is only used to attach to verbs, so it's not stressed as its own word. Te quiero, lávate, lavarte, etc."
Spanish,3dphm0,Spitalian,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"All diacritic accents (that are used to tell apart almost homophones) are used when one of the words is never stressed, and the other is always stressed. It can be argued that ""si"" (meaning ""if"") can be stressed, though."

Mucha vez se dice que el portugués es muy próximo al castellano pero vale decir que hay una diferencia grande y la variedad del portugués es casi tan impresionante como la del español.  Por ejemplo, compara el acento de este grupo lisboeta con este rapero de RJ.   Y he aquí algunas frases comunes (añado la AFI para que tengan alguna idea de la pronunciación donde podría ser difícil):  Oi: oye, saludo informal, también utilizado en Brasil para pedir que alguien repita lo que acaba de decir Olá [o.'la]: hola  Bom dia ['bõ.'ʤi.ɐ] (br-sudeste), ['bõ.'di.ɐ] (br-nordeste e pt): buenos días Tudo bem? ['tu.du.bẽ] (br) : ¿Cómo estás? (el saludo más común en Brasil) Está bom/boa [ɨʃ.'ta.'bõ/'bo.ɐ] (pt): ¿Cómo está usted?, ¿Estás bien? (saludo formal en Portugal) Adeus [ɐ.'ðewʃ] (pt): adiós legal [le.'gaw] (br): genial, chévere, bacano, (cool) fixe ['fi.ʃɨ] (pt): genial, chévere, bacano (cool, sólo usado en Portugal). tchau [ʧaw]: chao, adiós (muy informal)  Mándenme un pm si quieren más informaciones."

Después de Checo es Eslovaco, que algunas personas en el este hablan. Finalmente, hay el idioma de Silesia y alemán, de que los dos tienen casi a ningún que los habla, porque el idiomas de Silesia está muriendo, y los alemanes no se vivan en la Republica Checa nunca más.  Solamente hablo Checo, pero es fácil entender para un hablante de Checo Eslovaco. También, probablamente puedo aprender el idioma de Silesia, pero no creo que hay un uso para este idioma.  EDIT: ¡Frases!  En Checo: Já jsem český. Jsem z severa Prahy, a mluvím čeština, španělština, a angličtina. Myslím, že Kladsko a Slezko měli by se částy z Českou Republiku.  En Español: Soy checo. Soy del norte de Praga, y hablo checo, español, y inglés. Pienso que Kladsko y Silesia deberían ser un parte de la Republica Checa.  Punto interesante: ¡El pronombre reflexivo en Checo y Español es el mismo! Los dos usan la palabra «se», y están dicho casi el mismo. La división más grande entre los dos es que mientras en español «se» se convertirá a «te, me, nos», y «os», en checo nunca se convertirá a nada diferente excepto cuando uso en la segunda persona en el frase equivocado a «para (infinitivo)te» (eso es «aby (příčestí)ses» en checo)."

This paragraph talks about ""po"".   -Somewhere along the line, during the evolution of the Chilean dialect, someone started adding “po” to the end of words for emphasis.  “Sí-po” and “no-po” (yes and no) are the most common, although “obvio-po” (obviously, you stupid imbecile) and “ya-po” (hurry, more or less) are common.  When someone is really worked up (and usually whiney), they may say an entire sentence, pause briefly, and add “po” at the end.   I imagined it comes from ""pues"" and this etymology page seems to agree.  In Spain some people use ""po/poh/pos"" instead of ""pues"", especially in exclamations: ¡Poh bueno!

When I was there I asked someone why/how it started and they said that pues is often used in this way to add emphasis, but as Chileans tend to speak very quickly and shorten words (dropping an s, etc) pues became po attached on to the end of certain words/phrases.

For example I'm a blonde with a family who comes from Italy and there's not even a minuscule part of me that can be called aborigen. So what's the point? I lived here my entire life and so did my parents and grandparents and I still look completely European.  I really don't understand what's the point, this girl said she's Indian Latina or I don't know and she can't even speak proper Spanish. She's an American and that's it.

Spanish,3defg8,Hyperlingual,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:05:32 2015 UTC,"I had the same question, and eventually settled on this definition.  In short:     Hispanic refers to language. Latino refers to geography.     Hispanic includes Spain herself and places that were influenced by Spain.  Many of these people still speak Spanish (Mexico) but some don't (the Philippines).     Latino refers to Latin América, which is arguably anywhere in the Americas (including the Caribbean) except the U.S. and Canada."
Spanish,3defg8,polyclod,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:36:45 2015 UTC,"Hispanic refers to language.  Latino refers to geography.  Basically, you are Hispanic if you and/or your ancestry come from a country where they speak Spanish. You are Latino if you and/or your ancestry come from a Latin American country.   Those kind of contradict eachother though. You could easily rewrite the second sentence as ""You are Latino if you and/or your ancestry come from a country in the Americas where they speak a Romance language."" They both refer to language and, to an extent, culture."

Spanish,3dep71,anastee,5,Wed Jul 15 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"No one thing is going to take you from zero to expert, and there isn't much evidence to suggest that any one approach is superior to the others.  What I usually recommend is:      Find a beginner's course that fits your goals.  For example, if you're learning Spanish for travel, find a course that focuses on travel.  If you're learning for conversation, find a course that focuses on conversation.  Begin at chapter one and keep going.  If your chosen method is heavy on text (like Duolingo) or audio (like Pimsleur), consider using a second program to provide a more balanced approach.  By the time you're halfway through that beginner program, start using the language.  Read a Spanish language newspaper, watch some Spanish shows on YouTube, and find somebody to have a short conversation.  Studying the language will only get you so far; to really get comfortable with it, you have to use it consistently.  When you're done with the beginner's program, bump up the immersion activities.  If you have some time, this paper discusses several things you can do to improve your language skills.  Many people like reading the Harry Potter series, as they start easy and get gradually more challenging.  Another common approach is to find or make a flashcards deck of the 2,000 most common Spanish words and practice a few each day.   Some free online resources:     Duolingo - Very popular language software.  I'm not a huge fan myself, because it's heavily focused on written translation, but it's as good a place as any to start. Language Transfer - audio program delivered via YouTube.  Like paid programs Pimsleur or Michel Thomas, it focuses on forming sentences, which you might imagine is an important part of being able to speak the language. Coffee Break Spanish - Podcast, about 160 episodes of 15 minutes each.  The teacher is Scottish, but his pronunciation is good and the material is entertaining. Study Spanish - About 100 grammar lessons, including exercises for each.  I probably wouldn't go through the whole thing; I just read the sections that I need to know, like if I need some explanation of a certain verb tense."

This is where I go to learn how to conjugate verbs because literally no one Spanish program teaches verb conjugation, so I had to self-teach.  And after my studying is done I go to www.interpals.com which is essentially a online pen pal kind of thing. You find someone who knows the language and you begin talking with them.

As long as you realise that RS isn't a magical piece of software that will autonomously implant a language into your brain, you should most certainly feel like you are making progress with learning the language. People complain that RS doesn't sufficiently teach grammar and that it over simplifies things but if you simply do some revision on the words & phrases it throws at you with a Spanish dictionary or Google, it's actually a very handy method. It's similar to paying a teacher for lessons; the teacher cannot just make you a great Spanish speaker, it's something you must work on together to achieve. A language cannot be taught, it can only be learnt. This is how Rosetta Stone works and for me personally, it is working.  However, I feel that the price is exceptionally steep and this can almost undermine the actual value of the information presented. So if you don't see money as an object, I would certainly recommend Rosetta Stone but if you want absolute value for your money, then looking into other methods of learning would probably be the best idea. Websites like http://www.spanishdict.com/ & http://www.studyspanish.com/ are good places to start in my opinion. Either way, you will have to study hard and be dedicated...money or no money."

I just hate that I can walk into my local bookstore and see that overpriced yellow box being touted as the end all be all of language learning, when there are far more effective methods available for much less money. I don't really like Duolingo, but I would be very pleased to see them give Rosetta Stone a thrashing."

Spanish,3dav72,schugesen,12,Wed Jul 15 20:08:59 2015 UTC,"So, you advanced Spanish speakers and natives from all over the world, are ""B"" and ""V"" REALLY pronounced EXACTLY the same?    Yes. They are really pronounced EXACTLY the same. Pronounce both as a /b/ as in ""bacca"" from your example, never as ""vacca"". The English and Italian /v/ does not exist in Spanish, and both orthographic <b> and <v> are the same exact sound: /b/. There are two exceptions however.   The first is that there are two ways to pronounce <b> and <v>. The phoneme /b/ will become [β], a bilabial approximant in most environments, namely everywhere except at the start of a sentence, after a pause, etc (maybe after nasal consonants, I don't quite remember). It sounds a bit more like a [v] or [w]. There's still no distinction between <b> and <v>, they BOTH go through these sound changes in the same way (because, once again, they've been fused into the same sound since Old Spanish) but that may explain why you think you hear two different sounds, because BOTH <b> and <v> are pronounced [β] and [b].  The second exception is that I've heard that some heritage speakers in the United States WILL make a distinction. Though that's only something I've HEARD about. I've never heard that feature myself, and I'm skeptical about whether it actually exists in real native speakers. Still, this feature will only be limited to a small amount of people in the USA, not in the rest of the hispanic world.  [Edit: Source; Spanish phonology and linguistics classes in college]"
Spanish,3dav72,guoshe,8,Tue Jul 14 22:49:55 2015 UTC,"Correct. Some heritage speakers in the US have ""imported"" the American English v into Spanish. Source: I live in the U.S."

I know an Australian who has lived in Burgos, Spain for many decades and sounds exactly like a native except that he makes a distinction between b/v -- probably due to the English he learnt when he was young."
Spanish,3dav72,Dr_Gage,5,Wed Jul 15 02:37:31 2015 UTC,"The distinction in heritage speakers in the US comes up in some pretty limited contexts:   Reading of words spelled with <v> In spontaneous speech: Among folks who have some education in Spanish reading/writing as adults in the US (interference from the written form through analogy with English) In spontaneous speech: Through analogy with English cognates that are very similar in form   This last one can make for some other interesting changes as well.

Spanish,3dav72,profeNY,3,Tue Jul 14 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"Another perspective. You don't think about this when you speak English or Italian, but the articulation of /b/ and /v/ involves different parts of the mouth. /b/ is pronounced with the lips together (linguists call it a bilabial consonant) and /v/ is pronounced with the upper teeth on the lower lip (it's ""labiodental""). Same for /p/ versus /f/. So Spanish is basically missing the labiodental consonants; whether you spell it /b/ or /v/, the Spanish sound is always bilabial."

Spanish,3d5n67,CWHats,5,Tue Jul 14 13:01:39 2015 UTC,The reality is that getting good grades in Spanish class and talking to a professor is almost nothing like actually arriving in a Spanish-speaking country and having to talk to natives every day to survive. The pressure is really on when you don't have any other options.   I found this out the hard way as well. How could I get all As in Spanish and not understand a thing once in country?

Spanish,3d5n67,KingsElite,2,Mon Jul 13 21:04:00 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I don't know if your Spanish classes were the same but in mine there is a disturbing lack of meaningful speaking and listening of Spanish that occurs in the class, in the homework, or on the tests. It's a travesty really and there's no mistake when people leave these classes and struggle mightily with conversation. I don't know why they administer freakin multiple choice tests like they expect when we leave to use Spanish in the real world the people we talk to will write what they're saying on a sheet of paper and give us a list of pre-approved responses. It's stupid. That's not how language is used. If you want people to be good at speaking the language you need to get them practicing speaking the language."

I thought I had done everything right.  I met locals, I stayed with a spanish speaking only family, I studied my vocab and grammar every night.  But even 3 months in when I started hanging with locals who were in groups, I really struggled.  As others have said, one on one is your best friend.  See if you can find an international bar.  I was fortunate to have one within walking distance of my house and it's where all the local women went to meet international guys like myself.  They were patient with my Spanish and great fun to chat with, particularly over a few Escudos.  I had some very insightful chats I otherwise would not have had in group situations.  I could have stayed in my little American group the whole time but I got out and met people and that's what you have to do as well.  No te preocupes amigo!

The sound can be quite loud and really gets their attention. This same sound is also used to call dogs. You make it by touching the part of your flattened tongue just behind the tip to the spot where most people make a /t/ sound (the alveolar ridge) and sucking in.

Spanish,3d6hph,osnofla,5,Fri Jul 17 23:46:52 2015 UTC,"This is the table as my cultural experience as a Buenos Aires native speaker, parent as well of a two year old daughter:    Concept Spanish    Mother Mamá/Mami   Father Papá/Papi   Baby Nene/bebé   Food -   drink/water agua   sleep domí (""dormir"")   urination pipí/pichí   defecation popó/caca   bath -   hurt nana   walk -   breast teta   penis pitilín   vagina -   nice lindo   bad, don't no   dirty feo   hot quema   cold fío   nothing left yatá (ya está), nohamá (""no hay más"")   little chiquitito / tiquitito   dog babá / guau-guau   cat michi / miau   bird ?   goblin cuco   going out salí (""salir"")   peek-a-boo onetá (""dónde está"")   carry on back upa   noise -   goodies ushe    And I said ""cultural"" because that table is probably more of a social convention, an archetype that exists in people's mind and that is not universally applied. I am sure most parents will disagree in some of the items, because I think baby-talk is something that's developed between parents and the child who's learning to talk, it's two ways and evolves all the time, and the shape it takes when the baby still can't utter no words is based on what the parents heard when they were babies in turn. My parents would tell me ""pepés"" for shoes, and my wife's parents would not.  My personal take is that babies understand the same, no matter if you say ""pepé"" or ""zapato"", a word is a word, so I try to talk normally to my daughter, I use ""pis"" instead of ""pipí"" because it's more natural, and shorter ;) When I hear that she gets a word and tries to use it in her fashion, I won't contradict her and adopt that word to talk with her. So, for example, when she learned our dog's name ""Toto"", suddenly all dogs were Totos from that point on, and the proper word ""perro"" will be delayed and introduced later. The same for the birds: she saw a lot of different birds in her short life, but ""Pato"" (duck) stuck with her because of Pocoyó, so all birds were Patos since, even flies and mosquitoes (that she sees as really tiny birds). So if she sees a dove in the park, I would tell her ""there's a Pato"". Time will take care of corrections; eventually she learned ""mosca"" (fly), in her way (""moco""), for example. In this way, baby-talk is a language always evolving between her and us, and we try not to be patronizing with her. I would say ""lindo"" and she will say ""nino"", but I will keep saying ""lindo"": I will use her word choices, my vocabulary will be shorter with her, and my tone of voice also will be sweeter with her, I won't talk to her like an adult, but not as a complete idiot either ;)"

Spanish,3d5lj1,guoshe,2,Tue Jul 14 01:43:12 2015 UTC,"Hope this helps, it answers both op's question and yours. There are few exceptions, but the overall rule is very simple:  4.7. Sujeto de nombre colectivo. Los sustantivos colectivos son aquellos que, en singular, designan un conjunto de seres pertenecientes a una misma clase (gente, clero, familia, rebaño, hayedo, cubertería, etc.); los colectivos denotan por sí mismos la clase de seres a la que pertenece el conjunto (la gente se compone de personas, el clero de clérigos, la familia de parientes, etc.). Cuando uno de estos sustantivos funciona como sujeto, el verbo debe ir en singular, así como los pronombres o adjetivos a él referidos: «El rebaño se aleja definitivamente» (Bojorge Aventura [Arg. 1992]); «Esa misma gente prefiere que la embauquen a sentirse defraudada» (Esquivel Deseo [Méx. 2001]); a veces, sobre todo cuando sujeto y verbo están alejados por la existencia de elementos interpuestos o incisos, el verbo va indebidamente en plural, al realizarse la concordancia de acuerdo con el sentido plural del nombre colectivo, y no con su condición gramatical de sustantivo singular: «Esa gente nos están masacrando» (RdgzJuliá Peloteros [P. Rico 1997]); «La gente que componía todas esas regiones de Santander del Sur, sur de Bolívar y parte de Antioquia fueron muy afectadas por la violencia oficial» (Calvo Colombia [Col. 1987]); debió decirse nos está masacrando y fue muy afectada, respectivamente. La concordancia en plural sí es admisible cuando se pasa de una oración a otra, pues en ese caso al segundo verbo le corresponde, en realidad, un sujeto plural tácito: «La gente se acercaba y en cuanto veían la escena chillaban» (Llongueras Llongueras [Esp. 2001]); «Preguntábamos a la gente cómo se imaginaban que era Manuel Rodríguez» (Ruffinelli Guzmán [Ur. 2001]), esto es, cómo se imaginaban [ellos] que era... En las oraciones copulativas con ser cuyo atributo no es un adjetivo, sino un sustantivo, tanto el verbo como el atributo van en plural: «Esta gente son asesinos» (Universal [Ven.] 7.4.97); pero si el atributo es un adjetivo, es incorrecta la concordancia en plural: «La gente aquí son desordenados» (Santiago Sueño [P. Rico 1996]); debió decirse La gente aquí es desordenada. Cuando en el colectivo está incluida la persona que habla o a quien se habla, es normal en el habla coloquial poner el verbo en primera o segunda persona del plural: «La gente de teatro nos conformamos con poco y nada» (Clarín [Arg.] 12.2.97); «A los pocos días, toda la familia navegábamos por el Atlántico» (Olmos Marina [Esp. 1995]); «La gente mayor siempre habláis de la vida» (Gala Ulises [Esp. 1975]).    4.8. Sujeto de cuantificador + de + sustantivo en plural. Los sustantivos cuantificadores son aquellos que, siendo singulares, designan una pluralidad de seres de cualquier clase; la clase se especifica mediante un complemento con de cuyo núcleo es, normalmente, un sustantivo en plural: la mitad de los animales, la mayoría de los profesores, una minoría de los presentes, el resto de los libros, el diez por ciento de los votantes, un grupo de alumnos, un montón de cosas, infinidad de amigos, multitud de problemas, etc. La mayor parte de estos cuantificadores admiten la concordancia con el verbo tanto en singular como en plural, dependiendo de si se juzga como núcleo del sujeto el cuantificador singular o el sustantivo en plural que especifica su referencia, siendo mayoritaria, en general, la concordancia en plural: «Hacia 1940 la mayoría de estos poetas había escrito lo mejor de su obra» (Paz Sombras [Méx. 1983]); «La mayoría de los visitantes habían salido» (Marías Corazón [Esp. 1992]); «Una veintena de personas ocupaba la sala» (Chavarría Rojo [Ur. 2002]); «Una veintena de curiosos observaban de lejos a un piquete» (PzReverte Maestro [Esp. 1988]); sin embargo, cuando el verbo lleva un atributo o un complemento predicativo, solo es normal la concordancia en plural: «La mayoría de estos asesinos son muy inteligentes» (Mendoza Satanás [Col. 2002]); «La inmensa mayoría de las casas permanecían vacías» (Savater Caronte [Esp. 1981]). Los sustantivos cuantificadores que se usan sin determinante (infinidad, cantidad, multitud) establecen la concordancia obligatoriamente en plural, pues, en realidad, forman con la preposición de una locución que determina al sustantivo plural, que es el verdadero núcleo del sujeto: «Infinidad de católicos desatendieron semejante orden pontificia» (Vidal Ocultismo [Esp. 1995]); «Cantidad de organizaciones se dedican a [...] ayudar a personas que han sido víctimas de abuso sexual» (NHerald [EE. UU.] 21.10.97).    http://lema.rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=XEVeLzVZaD6CG25cW5"

I'm not sure as to why they provided that translation, but then again, the book may contain a few errors, as profeNY pointed out.  To mean something close to that translation, I would say something like: ""El granjero liderea para llevar a abrevar a los caballos."" Another: ""El granjero lleva el mando para llevar a abrevar a los caballos."" A bit wordy, but they work.  Those sentences mean the farmer is acting as a leader, and his goal is taking the horses to water."

Spanish,3d0ahl,eatscheeerios,8,Sun Jul 12 14:18:37 2015 UTC,"What /u/babysoul said was all very true! What I would add is actually try to memorize the vocab you deem important. For me, I was obsessed with learning the verbs and conjugations, but then had to go back later and actually learn more vocab to go with it. So, once you get to know the basic vocab, it doesn't hurt to always be learning more as you go along. Also, on that note, you are going to have to do some rote memorization at times, sometimes you are going to forget, but that's OK. The feeling of being able to come up with the words without a second thought makes it so so worth it. Just give it time and patience."
Spanish,3d0ahl,eatscheeerios,2,Sun Jul 12 13:41:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  It sounds like I should try to translate everyday things in my head as I do them, and if I don't know the word I should look it up since I use it more often. Have you done something similar?  And I'm glad you mentioned the memorization. I was hesitant to do it, especially with the conjugations, with hopes I'd just ""pick it up"" (very naive). So hearing that it's important from someone will give me some motivation for that; it'll be nice when I can come up with the words without a second thought!"
Spanish,3d0ahl,polyclod,3,Sun Jul 12 13:48:56 2015 UTC,"Sip! What you mentioned is exactly what I did. I took spanish through middle and high school, so I had very directed vocab lists that I just learned for the test and forgot, but then about halfway through high school I decided oh I actually want to learn not just get through this, so I already had a basic knowledge. I also have a very close friend whose first language is spanish so I frequently call him up to find out what the ""native way"" is. Basically what I did though, would be thinking about what I'm saying/doing and then write a note in my phone if there was a memorable word that I didn't know (like say, mirror, which for the record is espejo). I wouldn't go crazy and try to learn every single word all at once, though. You can build up your list, but only focus on a few at a time. Also, I'd suggest making a list and displaying it. For instance, every time I learn a new word, I write in on these papers that I have pinned to my wall and then when I'm just laying in bed or whatever, I can look over and see it. I'm so glad I could help!! :) Sorry for the poor organization, though, I'm on the reddit is fun app for andriod and it's not so good for formatting posts."

You can't use ""es"" here.   the bus isn't temporarily equipped with the restroom   This is one of the many criteria we use to tell if we need to use ""ser"" or ""estar"", but not the only one. Even the most basic ser/estar lesson explains that it's not always a matter of temporary vs permanent.  When we use the participle as an adjective, we always use ""estar. Ser+participle would be the passive voice, and you are not using the passive voice in this example.  Another way to look at this is that we use ""estar"" when the characteristic is the result of a change or transformation, e.g.:   La ventana está rota Mi abuelo está muerto El trabajo está terminado Estoy casado   These are not inherent qualities of these things, they are the result of an action or process, but once this happens, these qualities can be permanent.

En es más utilizado en tratos de persona a persona, donde los precios pueden fluctuar libremente (ej. Le vendí mi coche a Juan en 20 mil pesos, el precio de un coche es negociable); mientras que a es más utilizado en un contexto de un trato entre un negocio/tienda/empresa y una persona, donde el precio es generalmente fijo (ej. Compré esta pantalla 4K a 8 mil pesos, no es muy usual que uno haga una negociación con una tienda, así que el precio se mantiene fijo).

Spanish,3czmtc,earlgrhaay,3,Sun Jul 12 13:18:50 2015 UTC,"Boot verbs only make sense if you look back to Latin. The e that alternates with ie was a short vowel in Latin (e.g. Sp. sentir < Lat. sĕntire) while the e that alternates with i was long (e.g. medir < Lat. mētīre). This is the short answer -- for a longer one you can read this post or consult a good history of Spanish textbook, like Ralph Penny's. Since Spanish has lost Latin's difference between long and short vowels, you now have to memorize which verbs fall into which pattern. It's a nuisance, but just think how many irregular verbs Spanish speakers have to deal with when they learn English!  Edit: added sentir and medir examples."
Spanish,3czmtc,profeNY,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:29:51 2015 UTC,"The basic groups of -ir Radical changing verbs include the aforementioned ie-e and e-i, as well as the uncommon o-ue shown, as far as I am aware, by morir and dormir e.g. se murió el invierno pasado. The best way to employ these verbs correctly with the minimum amount of effort is to first find associated compounds (seguir, conseguir, proseguir, perseguir, subseguir) all of which will change in exactly the same way. The difference between E-IE and E-I can be further distinguished by examining the position of the changing vowel in the verb. It seems to be that E-IE occurs more frequently before an R e.g. sugerir, requirir, referir, pervertir, invertir, and that E-I more often precedes harder constonants like in regir and medir. Aside from this, repeated usage of these verbs, many of which are extremely common, will solidify their exact changes in your mind and they will definitely start to look more and more intuitive as time goes on, and hopefully there'll be no confusion between them."
Spanish,3czmtc,JacoboArbenz,-1,Sun Jul 12 22:38:27 2015 UTC,"well i don't want to memorize it, i want to know exactly what im saying and why im saying it. an example: mentir - to lie conjugates to: yo miento tu mientes miente and so on  then pedir - to ask for conjuates to  yo pido tu pides pide and so on...  the first one I have to change the e to ie and the second verb my book changes it from e to i so I am just confused..."
Spanish,3czmtc,molecularpoet,10,Sun Jul 12 06:00:50 2015 UTC,"well i don't want to memorize it, i want to know exactly what im saying and why im saying it   In the end you'll have to learn it. Just like you know that ""bring"" is ""brought"" but ""ring"" is ""rang"" and ""swim"" is ""swam"" but ""dim"" is ""dimmed"". Or why ""be"" becomes ""was"" but it can be ""were"" if it's second person etc.   I mean, you can go deep into the linguistics of these things if you're interested, but the best way for a Spanish learner is to learn the patterns and specific cases."

If you're ok with some more reggaeton stuff which is a bit faster then there's a huge variety out there. You may even remember Gasolina by Daddy Yankee all those years ago. He's had a large number of hits, many worth checking out. A notable recent one is ""Sigueme y te sigo"".  Nicky Jam certainly, you may well have heard ""Él Perdon"" as it climbed up the billboard top 100, he's one of my favourites alongside J Balvin (6am and Ay Vamos are probably the two best) and Farruko.  Don Omar, known (to the anglosphere) for the remix of Danza Kuduro has a new album out recently, which I think is fantastic. Wisin y Yandel are a great duo and have a variety of solo stuff. Chino y Nacho are a Venezuelan duo that have a couple of good songs.  A guy on youtube called ""DJ EDUARDO"" has made a few reggaeton playlists with a variety in them, lengths of 30mins to 2 hours.

Shakira packs A LOT of words into her songs, which is great for your vocabulary.  Try:   Duet with Maná ""Mi Verdad"" -- this has a nice amount of vocabulary and is easy to understand. Ciega, Sordomuda Suerte Gitana La Tortura   Draco Rosa -- cool vibe, I just like his music.   Blanca Mujer Cómo Me Acuerdo   I also like Pablo Alborán; he's a cutie and if you're learning European Spanish, he's your man.   Solamente Tú Por Fin   Enrique Iglesias, because of course.

When I first started learning, I was really hung up on pronunciation. Whilst small, you can hear in this song the differences between Yandel and Enrique on a few words, highlighting the different dialects - Seseo in this case but Yeismo is another important one. It's nothing to worry about but it's worth being aware of, as you'll infer by context what word they mean but some become homophones e.g. Casa and Caza"

Flatmates bought me another one for my birthday, am building a collection. The prior knowledge is good, helps iron out mistakes. I sit there reading them aloud, trying to keep a good pace.

Spanish,3ct26q,-Obito-,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:35:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'm troubled about 'Viajaba a Mexico', the 2nd one, because in my mind, 'I was on my way' and 'I used to go' have quite different connotations.  I would have thought the former would be something more like 'estaba viajando' or 'estuve viajando' (the difference between of which I am pretty confident I will never, ever truly understand ;) ). However, that opens up a whole new bag of snakes ;)"
Spanish,3ct26q,-Obito-,2,Fri Jul 10 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"I was on my way to Mexico = I was travelling to Mexico = ""Viajaba a México"" = ""Estaba viajando a México"".    The only difference between ""estaba viajando"" and ""estuve viajando"" is that the first one is a continuous event that was already taking place when something else happened (so you focus on what happened WHILE you were doing something):   ""Estaba viajando a México cuando me enteré de su muerte"" = I was on my way to Mexico when I heard of his death.   But the second one is a statement to express something that happened (more than once) and it's already done, and there is no more information to add to it (so you focus on the event that took place, and only on that):    ""Estuve viajando a México (una y otra vez)"" = I kept travelling to Mexico (once and again).   If you just travelled once to Mexico, you would simply say ""Viajé a México"" (I went to Mexico)."
Spanish,3ct26q,profeNY,2,Fri Jul 10 18:26:37 2015 UTC,"EyeAmAhEr, you're not struggling too much -- it's genuinely challenging!  For your fourth example (Viajaba a México y compré un coche), if you meant that you bought the car while you were traveling in Mexico, I think you need to reword this. Maybe Compré un coche cuando estaba en México or Compré un coche cuando viajaba por México. (Could use mientras instead of cuando in either of these.)  Otherwise you end up with Obito's interpretation, that you bought the car en route."

Spanish,3cpbr2,Kadmon_Evans,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:47:05 2015 UTC,"The way I think of it may help you. Have you ever seen movies or read books with that old, Victorian-style English? People says things like, ""That imbecile, I should like to smack him in the face."" Silly example, but bear with me.  That ""should"" clearly does not represent ""should"" in the sense of ""deber""; it is not a suggestion that you ought to do it, it's merely a suggestion that you would like to do it; you're not doing it right now, but, hypothetically, supposing that you may. It's like you're taking a bit of liberty with reality.  The imperfect subjunctive of Spanish can be taken to have this sort of ""should"" in it, and I find that this makes it easier to wrap the mind around its use, and when to use it. The use of the subjunctive in this way seems to have fallen out of use in English, but you can still hear it/read it in some places.  The way I interpret ""quisiera pedir una cerveza"", in my mind, is ""I should want to order a beer"".

I'm really into our country becoming more bilingual and this is a bit of a start. I'm not sure what the ""point"" is.   I DO know that Jeb Bush is pining for opportunities to flaunt his spanish skills, because Latinos usually vote democrat, because democrats usually support them in their specific ""big"" issues.

Spanish,3cm0rm,StarrkDreams,3,Wed Jul 8 23:21:48 2015 UTC,"I really hate when I ask a question and people give me an answer that is different than the one I'm looking for. However, I HIGHLY suggest watching shows in Spanish WITH Spanish subtitles. Try to avoid English subtitles.  I recommend going on Netflix (if you have it) and watching kids shows in Spanish. If you use Google Chrome you can download an app or plug-in called ""Hola"". Once you download this you can ""change"" the country you are viewing from.  I change mine to Mexico or Colombia and can view Netflix the same way a local of those areas would see it. Many shows (children and adult) are dubbed into Spanish. There are tons of kid shows as well, and you can filter by age. If you are starting off, try watching something for really young kids with Spanish subtitles. I promise you will start to understand a lot of it with time (many of these shows talk about shapes, colors, etc).   Good luck and I hope you will stick with my advice.  TL;DR  Spanish with Spanish subtitles = good Spanish with English subtitles = bad Use ""Hola app"" and watch Netflix from Latin America."
Spanish,3cm0rm,buenpescador,3,Thu Jul 9 14:46:44 2015 UTC,I didn't want shows with Spanish subtitles because I thought it would be hard to follow along without some sort of translation. I'll follow your advice and try that then.

Even if your vocabulary is very small, you will learn a lot if you watch kid shows.   I don't know much about you but I bet your vocab is much larger than a 3 year old (you probably already know 100's of words in Spanish without even realizing it). Watch shows made for 2-3 year olds if you have to. Dora the Explorer and Sesame Street are popular too. Look for ""comprehenisble input"" and give it your best. Good luck!"

José se puso su chaleco salvavidas y se tiró al mar.   Luego, José recibió otra llamada. Esta vez era Brandon. ¡Su autobús se había caído a un precipicio!  José usó su máquina mágica de crecimiento para convertirse en un gigante y utilizó su enorme garra para recoger el autobús de Brandon.   Brandon estaba muy contento.

San Juan, la ciudad más peligrosa en términos de asesinatos es la 7ma en USA pero la mayoría de esos asesinatos son entre pandillas de narcotraficantes. La isla en general aparece bastante alta en las listas de violencia a nivel mundial pero ese es el resultado de su extrema densidad poblacional que es la más alta en los Estados Unidos. Pero que conste, no estoy diciendo que en Puerto Rico no hayan demasiados crímenes, porque los hay, solo estoy diciendo que comparado con muchos otros lugares es un sitio en el cual uno puede estar seguro sin hacer mucho esfuerzo.  La isla es pequeña así que no tiene ninguna zona que esté fuera del control de las autoridades. Hay lugares en los que uno no debe turistear como los residenciales públicos pero eso ya es cuestión de ejercitar el sentido común. Siempre y cuando uno no deje su iPad en la playa o se meta a pasear tarde en la noche en los callejones oscuros de los barrios pobres a uno no le debe pasar nada."

Try Isabel Allende's La Ciudad de Las Bestias. It's written for about middle school age students (native Spanish speakers) I believe, but she's a good author and the story isn't lame. If you like it there are sequels and it's pretty easy to understand! Also, if you like Harry Potter, the translations are good level."

It could be interesting for American people since it's a compilation of stories about American life by this Spanish journalist. It was light reading and the stories were fun, far from the typical ""lol Americans"" type of book I've come to expect."
Spanish,3chnly,Alquivira,2,Wed Jul 8 05:46:34 2015 UTC,Sounds interesting. I'm also a Spaniard and had never heard of that book. Noted for reading this summer.
Spanish,3chnly,phlogh,3,Wed Jul 8 07:45:55 2015 UTC,"I agree that El Quijote might be too tedious and difficult to read. It's a very long book, with a very convoluted structure, stories within the story, poems, etc. It's also written in an early form of modern Spanish, and the author tried to incorporate the language of the popular classes as well as old-fashioned language of chivalric literature, so it has some weird vocabulary and spelling, and even native speakers have trouble understanding some of the stuff.  The book is in the public domain. You can try to read the first chapter and see if you make any sense of it."
Spanish,3chnly,MistShinobi,4,Wed Jul 8 08:37:08 2015 UTC,"Just remember that Spanish (just like English) doesn't mean only ""old and tedious books"" xD.  I prefer modern books, and Don Quijote can be.... tedious, yes that's the word."
Spanish,3chnly,-Obito-,3,Wed Jul 8 05:10:09 2015 UTC,"I am studying Spanish at my university and the only book i can remember enjoying off the top of my head from one of my literature classes was El Señor Presidente (there were others but either I didn't enjoy them or I can't remember their names at the moment, haha). It has a more political theme, but is a great book and one you should consider reading if you plan to continue studying Spanish since Asturias is a well-known author (and it's not as long as Don Quixote). But if you're looking for lighter reading I would recommend trying books by hispanic writers that maybe you have already read in english, like The House on Mango Street. This is a shorter example, but you could always take a few short books instead of a long one. If you already understand the plot, rereading a book in a different language will help you focus more on understanding different words and phrases in Spanish that you might not already understand. You could also try reading English (or classic English-translated books) books in Spanish- for example, I bought a book in an Argentinian book store that contains three of Jack Kerouac's works in Spanish."
Spanish,3chnly,oilpig82,2,Wed Jul 8 00:51:29 2015 UTC,I might try an English book in Spanish but I think it would be more fun if I first tried something in Spanish. The book you recommended looks great and I might get that one

The book is about a Chilean teenager whose father is detained by the dictatorship's secret police in the time just before the plebiscite that ended Pinochet's reign; and (via the protagonist's girlfriend's dad) it's also about that same plebiscite.  It's not too thick (230 pages), the number of characters is relatively limited, the language wasn't too difficult for me (I'm a B1 student in Europe, no idea what that's equivalent to in the US!) and the subject interested me greatly, having just been to Chile :-) Not an instant classic or anything, but I found it a great book to start reading Spanish literature!  More recently, I read Gabriel Garcia Márquez's Relato de un naufragó with a dictionary to the side for all the nautical terms. As this is about a guy on a raft, the narrative's structure is not as complicated as Marquez's other works :-)"

It is funny, easy language and it explains the problems young people in Spain have to find work after emigrating to Germany.  literally what's happening right now in spain.  Another one would be ' 8 apellidos vascos '  Funny and about the problems (rivalry) between the people from the south of Spain (andalucia) and the basque country in the north.

Spanish,3ca600,HelloYesThisIsDuck,8,Mon Jul 6 08:31:22 2015 UTC,"According to the RAE mar its a ambiguous name, that is, it has the both genders... I personally say always el mar, but among sea people (fishermen, etc...) they usually use ""la mar"" (as in your example)   No hay ninguna regla que nos permita reconocer un nombre como ambiguo, pero, en general, según el recientemente aparecido ‘Diccionario panhispánico de dudas’ (2005), «la elección de uno u otro género va asociada a diferencias de registro o de nivel de lengua, o tiene que ver con preferencias dialectales, sectoriales o personales». Así, en el caso de el mar o la mar, el uso del femenino es más frecuente entre personas que viven del mar o en el mar como pescadores o marineros, los que se hacen a la mar cada día, faenan en alta mar o hablan de la mar en las tascas del puerto. source"

Edit: Found it- “He always thought of the sea as 'la mar' which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as 'el mar' which is masculine.They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.”"

EDIT: I forgot another phrase, not particularly literary or naval, in which ""la mar"" is used. Namely when swearing: ""me cago en la mar"".

The RAE is not just being poetic, it's making a pun on a common phrase.  As for the phrase ""mar de..."", it's interesting that ""mar"" normally changes between feminine or masculine in that context, depending on whether a definite or indefinite article is used: it can be ""la mar de libros""...but also ""un mar de libros"", whereas both ""el mar de libros"" and ""una mar de libros"" sound rather strange."

You should ask them about how they feel about the activity.  It's hard to ask that question because like you said you don't know their level of English.

Stuff that Irish teenagers like is probably really similar to things Spanish teens like (I'm from the US and the Spaniards I've met knew so much about even kinda obscure things...I'm sure Irish teens and other European teens are very similar). Sports (especially football--almost everyone has an opinion on Cristiano Ronaldo, he's a surprisingly fun conversation topic) are a great bet. Other celebrities (particularly really crazy American ones) are always fun to talk about...i.e. Miley Cyrus and Kim Kardashian.  In regards to level of English, some Spanish teens will be better than others. When I was 16, I had an exchange student my same age, and she spoke practically fluently. It took a few days for her to warm up, but I honestly didn't have to explain much to her at all except for really weird slang stuff. Yet when I studied abroad at age 21, I met a bunch of Spanish university students my same age who had a really hard time even with shorter conversations (we had exchange meetings where we'd alternate Spanish and English). Of course, they weren't immersed, and I think that makes a big difference. I imagine you might have more problems at the beginning, but it should get much easier."

But thinking about it more, I would use le with certain verbs. For example, 'yo le di una patada' (I gave him a kick, I kicked him), but I don't really know why.

Spanish,3c0glc,elcangri2124,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:24:57 2015 UTC,"Well, that's because in the way it is defined in the US, ""Hispanic"" is not an homogenous group and it certainly does not refer exclusively to people with Spanish heritage, as usually everyone coming from the Spanish-speaking Americas is considered a Hispanic, while not everyone from said countries has Spanish heritage.  Most of the Hispanic population in the US is actually mestizo (mixed indigenous and European).  I don't know how you identify yourselves and what cultural elements you have (or how are there distinct from the ""mainline"" white population), but in Europe Spaniards are not differentiated or separated from the rest of white Europeans."

We have lived in New Mexico for 400 years or so and as such I would say we do have blood that is mixed with Pueblo and other European families but have also retained our Spanish identity and hopefully our language will not die but probably will.  Sometimes I consider myself neither white or mestizo but New Mexico Spanish even though that may sound strange.  We have developed our own distinct identity just as Cubans, Mexicans or any other Spanish colony.  We just never emerged as a new nation but were absorbed by the United States.  We are very much Americanized also over the past 200 years and as such feel very American."

Learn to accept all of our differences and appreciate the rich history that Spain brought whether it is New Mexico, Mexico or South America.  Our accent is distinctly different from people from Mexico or any other part of Latin America and different than current day Spain because the language has been isolated for so long.  New Mexico for hundreds of years was an isolated outpost settlement of Spain.

Spanish,3bx93k,whichever,6,Thu Jul 2 23:50:42 2015 UTC,"Mexican here.  I would suggest Mexican soap operas, the actors usually are not very good, but their diction tends to be great, even a bit over the top. I know a few people who work in telenovela productions and they have told me one of the reasons the script tends to be repetitive and VERY clear (for example, they repeat the FULL name of the character every time someone mentions him or her) is because soap operas' main target audience are stay at home moms who are doing house chores while they watch them, so they are going to be distracted half the time, and the producers don't want to alienate this audience because they can't understand what's going on or missed a key part of the action.  That said, my personal recommendations are:  El vuelo del Aguila - historical telenovela set in the Porfiriato (leading up to the Mexican revolution). Sort of historically accurate. Very interesting and you'll learn a bit about Mexico's history.  Cuna de Lobos - this is just AWESOME, the evil woman (Catalina Creel) is just delightfully evil.  El maleficio - Witches, potions and love triangles!  There are more, but I think those three are a good start.  Hope this helps :)"

I can often understand a new station perfectly, but will completely misunderstand any series that's spoken in a more ""real"" way.   Watch just about any news station or documentary. They enunciate more clearly and need to speak at a much slower rate naturally. You won't find many shows/movies that do the same."

Spanish,3bw5vu,Absay,17,Thu Jul 2 18:01:21 2015 UTC,"Repetuza doesn't exist in Spanish and it's certainly not Mexican slang (I might be wrong but I don't really think so).   Bear in mind the Spanish spoken by people living in the US is not the same as in Mexico (or any other country), so it's actually: 1) either Mexican-American Spanish slang, for which I have no idea what it means, or 2) they meant respetuosa, as in respectful, polite."

And I think you are also right with respect to Spanglish creeping in: the ad also appears to use the word ""confidente"" as an adjective, with the meaning of ""confident"" in English, when in Spanish it is only a noun, with a rather different meaning (""confidant"")."

You can see those produced by TVE on their website.  Generally speaking, you might want to check ""La 2"". It is the more cultural public channel in Spain and documentaries are probably the main content. Again, they combine national and international productions. You should check this list and see what shows you like. Most of those shows have episodes uploaded on Youtube. I really like ""Al Filo de lo Imposible"", it depicts the travels of mountain climbers and other adventurers and it's really well done.  If you want something more fast-paced and sensationalistic, you can check ""Comando Actualidad"".  The public TV in Spain shows tons of documentaries although most of them are more classic than Vice."

Noteworthy examples:   esternocleidomastoideitis: Not really used unless you're pointing out its length or you're a medical professional. electroencefalografistas: Easily understood word, still a bit too field-specific.   Thing is, syllables normally end in vowels in Spanish, so it only makes sense that there aren't that many words that end in consonants and are very long.  Also, there's the issue of actually defining what a word is (since you have a PhD in linguistics you're probably familiar with this dichotomy). You could always argue that the longest word would be muchisisisisisisi[...]mo or construct similar words like ultramegahiperrecontraquetequetequetequete[...]brutal (hey, that one even ends in a consonant!), which isn't exactly useful.  EDIT: added another example  EDIT2: Felt like finding more and came up with this: https://gist.github.com/clinchergt/8ed43b66a5343f552ee1 That includes ~40 pretty long words that end in a consonant (without filtering out plurals, which you don't seem to like).

Spanish,3bt1xc,QsGirl,3,Wed Jul 1 23:41:56 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I think maybe /u/profeny is studying syllable stress. Since words that end in n or s have the same stress as words that end in a vowel--stressed on the penultimate syllable--OP is categorizing them all together and instead is looking for words that may be stressed on the final syllable, as words that end with consonants other than n and s are."
