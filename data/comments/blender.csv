blender,3e2jh0,PandaHammer,13,Tue Jul 21 13:40:28 2015 UTC,"Hey, the helmet looks realy nice. But isn't >30K to high poly for a gameengine?"
blender,3e2jh0,thecali,0,Tue Jul 21 14:02:39 2015 UTC,"depends very much on the context.  culling means only a quarter of those are actually rendered when you're wearing it, and 2/3rds when you're not.  Plus, cutting it down and adding a normal map is always an option if we encounter framerate issues."
blender,3e2jh0,S1CKLY,10,Tue Jul 21 14:17:23 2015 UTC,"culling means only a quarter of those are actually rendered when you're wearing it, and 2/3rds when you're not   Programmer here; that's not how culling works.   If the helmet is made up of entirely separate draw calls your statement could be partially true (depending on the engine), but probably not.  If any part of a draw call is visible, the whole thing is passed to the GPU. Yes, fragments will be culled by clip or depth, but you're still suffering the cost of uploading all of the vertex buffers as well as all the textures/shaders required and the cost of the draw call itself, vertex shader, and possibly fragment shader as well if the verts pass clipping."
blender,3e2jh0,S1CKLY,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:07:21 2015 UTC,"Programmer here also, we have a fustrum culling algorithm that culls per surface, but thanks"
blender,3e2jh0,S1CKLY,10,Tue Jul 21 17:08:14 2015 UTC,"that culls per surface   So on top of the GPU cost for any surfaces that do pass culling, you'll be stressing the CPU with the excessive amount of bound checks as it iterates over each surface... even worse."
blender,3e2jh0,iKy1e,-28,Tue Jul 21 17:13:58 2015 UTC,Uppity little shit aren't you?
blender,3e2jh0,warepwn3,8,Tue Jul 21 17:23:23 2015 UTC,"Apologies if I was a bit blunt, I simply wanted to point out that more aggressive culling does not mean you get free wins.  If you think your engine can handle it, I'll take your word for it since I obviously know nothing of your experience level or even what engine you're using.  Edit: Also wanted to say that the helmet does look awesome. =)"
blender,3e2jh0,geoholyhart,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:21 2015 UTC,Ignoring his game engine I don't think my computer can handle it! I'll side with you.
blender,3e2jh0,nightwood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"Not a programmer here, would it be better to split the helmet into two mesh (front and back) and use mesh culling to hide the back of the helmet?"
blender,3e2jh0,Cheesewithmold,4,Tue Jul 21 21:44:39 2015 UTC,"I probably don't know enough about programming to even get in the middle of this, but I do know a little something about 3D modeling for games and for something so small (not sure how much attention its getting in the game) this does seem pretty dense, I'm especially not a fan of the vents on the front. I feel like you could be letting materials do a lot more work for you. Why not cut it down and let the normals do their thing like you mentioned earlier? Seems like the better route.   Does look really nice though. Good luck on the game."
blender,3e2jh0,boingyman,9,Tue Jul 21 18:06:32 2015 UTC,I'm amazed I can actually inspect this 3D model on my phone smoothly.  Anyway awesome effect/texture on the vizer!

blender,3e2jh0,Bubleguber,10,Tue Jul 21 18:45:18 2015 UTC,"Imho, not a very good model for a game.  Here's why:    You have numerous edge loops running through areas that are flat or areas that have no significant amount of change in the surface (especially on the circular ends). You have non-manifold geometry on the ""vent"" looking parts on the front, both inside and outside. You didn't delete the faces on the back side of the triangular prisms that give the vents their slots (that's 2 triangles per prism, 40 prisms, 80 triangles total). You didn't use a normal map to get some details (the two extrusions on the top, the one on the neck, even the vent slots). 32.4k faces on an object is extreme, even a bit of a stretch for characters (according to this) (Also, don't add polygons if you have the ""better hardware"" mentality (ex: ""I don't need to watch polycounts because I have a super computer!""), it just wastes polygons that you could put somewhere else)."
blender,3e2jh0,andrebravado,3,Tue Jul 21 17:22:46 2015 UTC,Aren't there tools to generate a low poly mesh+normal map from a high resolution mesh though?
blender,3e2jh0,andrebravado,2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:59 2015 UTC,"32,k of what? triangles or quads? in quads is really high but in triangles not, if in doubt always take triangles cos I think Sketchfab and everything out of blender/maya works with triangles and not quads."
blender,3e2jh0,andrebravado,4,Tue Jul 21 20:03:12 2015 UTC,Looks great! How do you do your materials when exporting from Blender into something like sketchfab?
blender,3e2jh0,Fortyseven,5,Tue Jul 21 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"blender exports the viewport settings to *.mtl files, which sketchfab accepts, then spend 5 minutes tuning them in the sketchfab PBR editor.  it's a really cool site I have to say.  Also thanks!"
blender,3e2jh0,Bouncingbunny13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:32:11 2015 UTC,So it exports the way it looks in the materials view on the 3d panel? And then the lighting is done inside sketchfab? Sorry for all the questions just amazed at the quality from an in browser experience!
blender,3e2jh0,Bouncingbunny13,3,Tue Jul 21 14:35:07 2015 UTC,"Question away!  Yes that's how it does it.  You can also select to use PBR materials which re-sets everything but the material's polys and the name, so you can build them from scratch to look real.  for instance, the whole helmet was white when I switched to PBR, but then I tuned the colours and textures for each material individually. [there's only about four on the whole model].  I really can recommend it for showing off your work, their PBR shader is almost perfect.  I would love them to support animations though."
blender,3e2jh0,Bouncingbunny13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:21 2015 UTC,Really cool - is the PBR shader node based or something different? How difficult was it to get the hang of?

blender,3e2jh0,WhenceYeCame,2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:35 2015 UTC,"it's variable based, so you specify a roughness, metalness, transparency amount etc.  obviously not as advanced as blender but quick to to work with and produces nice results.

There should be a sharpened edge with a precise angle.  The guards don't seem to be entirely functional. In a sword fight, it would be easy for the opponent to hit the ramp in the blade and jump his own blade over the guard into his hands.

blender,3dzliq,Dynamyght,8,Mon Jul 20 20:41:50 2015 UTC,Array modifier + curve modifier is my best guess. Make a small section and have it copied and curved into a circle.

blender,3dzliq,exDM69,2,Tue Jul 21 11:34:10 2015 UTC,"I tried as hard as I could to stick with Blender's sculpting but I just couldn't. It doesn't handle high amounts of polygons nearly as well (you can reach billions in ZBrush), and the retopology tools in ZBrush are amazingly clean (Zremesher). All in all ZBrush is a package devoted to sculpting, not a Jack of all trades, so it's a far more padded out program."

Basically he only has to do the detail work on 1/48th of a tire.   https://cgcookie.com/tutorial/modifier-stack-order/  this one has has some stuff on making motorcycle wheels, his technique is to say use a 32 sided circle, and then use 8 of the faces to do the detail work, and then copy it around using the 3d cursor as a pivot point(3d cursor is set to the center of the circle)  to turn it back into a circle. He also uses proportional editing using the pivot point as the 3d cursor to rotate the tire mesh around the 3d cursor to give a tire tread effect. He uses the same kind of circle technique to make the brake rotor and wheel spokes.   https://cgcookie.com/course/modeling-a-motorcycle/  Of course neither of them get into material set ups or texturing,or getting to that detail level he achieved but at least they give you an idea of how to create an even wheel.

blender,3e48tp,CGApe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:57:26 2015 UTC,"The 980 would be better for rendering in most ways. They both have 4gb of V-ram but issues with the 970 make it's v-ram split up into 3.5gb and 0.5gb chunks, which would vastly slow down memory intensive renders. As far as GPU horsepower goes your also better off with the 980, but not by a vast margin. If you're on a tight budget, the 970 is the way to go. You also mentioned interest in other GPU hardware. Any of the high tier quadro/tesla cards would be vastly better, but come with a huge price point. As for the rest of your PC, a 4790k is great but if you really want pure rendering horsepower, consider the 2011 CPU's due to their higher core count.

blender,3dxcir,thelopoco,8,Mon Jul 20 08:54:37 2015 UTC,"(x-post from /r/low_poly)  I'm back again after a short break!  This LoPoCo piece is a tribute to my two besties who moved from Copenhagen to Australia for work. They used to live together right on the waterfront at a place called Islands Brygge.  It's quite a unique area, with a purpose-built floating harbour bath (the harbour is clean enough to swim in) and has become an architectural icon in its own right, winning about forty bazillion awards. The atmosphere is what I imagine the lidos of the 1940's to be like.   If you've never seen this thing before, it might take a while for your brain to process what's happening. That's cool :)   Modelling and materials took around thirty hours I'd say, over the course of a month. I know you guys love work-in-progress stuff, so here's how it looked at the end of day one!   Generally when making these environments, I want to capture the essence of the place while making the scale diminutive and compressed. So some things become outsized and others are miniaturized. 7-story buildings become three, and some expanses of ground are removed altogether. You can see how it's all synthesized into a 'taster-menu' representation of the real photographs above. Absolute scale is less important than balance and composition. This is the first time I've really included figures in a scene too.   As ever, very happy to receive your comments, and I always do my best to answer any questions as fully as I can. Been Blending about four months now and still having a great time :D  You can follow the rest of my LoPoCo project on facebook or much higher quality on tumblr here.   Have a great Sunday, and don't swim in the water ;)  *  Additional: Someone asked how the building was made, and whether it was one giant mesh or separate meshes. I did a deconstruction render here  so you can see the modular assembly. I modelled one single vertical block, and then repeated it horizontally. Then created the window bays which overlay some other windows, followed by the turrets and roof sections. I like to keep things fairly modular, so I can re-use the assets in later pieces."

blender,3e1yql,andrebravado,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:42:41 2015 UTC,"There's a texture atlas add-on (ships with blender, simply called UV: Texture Atlas, enable it in the user preferences) which can be used to unwrap and bake your entire scene (or selected objects) to an image texture. It only automates the smart UV unwrap for multiple objects, though, meaning it's as fast as it gets, but rather inefficient. I've never had it result in overlapping UVs, but you never know.  Also, you'd still potentially need separate UVs for whatever materials you're trying to bake (unless you're using only procedural or box-mapped image textures)."
blender,3e1yql,TLOZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:59:49 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I'd not heard of the texture atlas. I'll have a go with it now.  Generally my materials in the scenes I'm looking at don't use any textures, just nodes. How does baking handle things like specularity and glass type shaders?"
blender,3e1yql,TLOZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:19:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a way to bake specular intensity in cycles the way you could do it in blender internal. You'd have to alter the material to output the specularity (e.g. two emission shaders, black & white, mixed by specular intensity). Hopefully they'll add in glossy intensity and roughness baking eventually.  Glass shaders you simply can't bake. I mean, you could, but it wouldn't look like glass. You'll have to set up a glass shader in Marmoset/ Unreal/ Unity/ whatever you're using. Generally speaking, you shouldn't and in some cases can't bake information that depends on the observer's point of view (e.g. reflections, fresnel, refraction)."

blender,3dzbgx,AttackingHobo,2,Mon Jul 20 21:13:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's obvious but use a mirror modifier with clipping enabled. Unless you have a special add on like retopoflow you pretty much start with a single plane or a vertice and then use face snapping in edit mode to get it to stick to the skeleton, then you extrude edges to create face loops. The F2 addon can help a lot(it's free and included with blender), I recommend learning a little bit about it. It can create faces very fast, I think you still have to use a transform operation like grab to make sure it sticks to the surface. I can't really look at your blend file because my internet is currently very shitty but on a normal characters arm usually you can save some time creating a cylinder and placing it around the arm and using the shrinkwrap modifier. I'd recommend trying to find some wireframes of humanoid models or skeletons with good topology to study first. I'm pretty shit at it still but I've retopologized two humanoid-ish models I've made, it takes practice and good planning skills unless you want to end up with a bunch of triangles or diamond quads."

blender,3dyfr5,TLOZ,2,Mon Jul 20 16:15:50 2015 UTC,"You can change the format in the render settings tab under 'Output'. There's an 'Encoding' section beneath where you can customize things further. In this case you'd want to change the format from MPEG-2 to MPEG-4 in the 'Encoding' settings. The 'Bitrate' defines the overall quality and file-size.  On a side-note, I'd never render anything straight to a lossy format. It's better to render out an image sequence (some lossless image format, e.g. PNG) and process that image sequence afterwards (which you could do in blender as well). That's especially useful if you're not sure what settings to use for the lossy encode (what you're trying to do). The video might end up having a poor quality, forcing you to re-render all your 3D scenes over again. Re-encoding an image sequence on the other hand is significantly faster."
