Im14andthisisWTF,2szrmw,gloubenterder,5,Mon Jan 19 23:59:26 2015 UTC,"I love ""The Raven"" and recite it every Sunday morning (from memory), kind of like a prayer or an incantation.  Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,  over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore;  while I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,  as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.  ""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door.  Only this, and nothing more."""
Im14andthisisWTF,2szrmw,2000luisluis,3,Tue Jan 20 00:01:41 2015 UTC,"Ah, distinctly I remember,  it was in the bleak December,  and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.  Eagerly I wished the morrow! Vainly, I had sought to borrow  from my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore.  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name ... Lenore!  Nameless here, forevermore."
Im14andthisisWTF,2szrmw,jomosexual,3,Tue Jan 20 00:03:03 2015 UTC,"And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain,  thrilled me, filled me, with fantastic terrors never felt before!  So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating  ""'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door.  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door.  This it is, and nothing more."""
Im14andthisisWTF,2szrmw,Holdmybeerwatchthis,3,Tue Jan 20 00:03:54 2015 UTC,"Presently, my soul grew stronger, hesitating there no longer,  ""Sir,"" said I, ""or Madame, truly, your forgiveness I implore!  But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,  And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,  that I scarce was sure I heard you...!"" Here, I opened up the door.  Darkness there, and nothing more."
Im14andthisisWTF,2szrmw,shurdi3,3,Tue Jan 20 00:04:34 2015 UTC,"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,  doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.  But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,  and the only word there spoken was the whispered word ""Lenore?""  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word ""Lenore...""  Merely this, and nothing more."
