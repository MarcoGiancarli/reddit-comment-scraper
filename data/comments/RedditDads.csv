RedditDads,3e5iwy,djnecroboomboom,5,Wed Jul 22 02:58:09 2015 UTC,"For the rally race, there's one thing that I've done which has worked quite well.   I created a rally race along the straight stretch of highway leading to and under Fort Zancudo, which ends on the north side of the tunnel. I then named it ""Daily objective rally race"" with a description stating that it's a short, simple race for completing your daily challenge.   I usually get someone who joins within a few minutes of invites going out who rarely leaves, because they know exactly by the description what they're in for.   edit: Link to rally race"
RedditDads,3e5iwy,Psychko,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:26:48 2015 UTC,Damn I wish you were on PS4 so I could bookmark it. Maybe I'll whip one together myself. Great idea though!
RedditDads,3e5iwy,Psychko,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:52:59 2015 UTC,"Haha I'd love to be on PS4 as well, but the race takes all of 5 minutes to create. Mine starts just before the bridge south of Fort Zancudo where the road first straightens out, then finishes just outside the northern tunnel entrance.  It's straight, no fuss, simple and it's almost idiot proof. Almost because there are some dedicated idiots out there ;)"

Thats what you call a fuck-up and I ashamedly did just that lol.  Its all good tho, the team forgave me even after I lost connection on the second attempt and no one seemed to get grumpy about it.  Plus you can't do much to avoid losing connection so even if you hadn't crashed it was beyond your control."
RedditDads,3e07i5,Fletcher_DarkWater,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:52:13 2015 UTC,"Don't feel bad, I managed to frustrate /u/tehjoyrider into taking a much needed break. It all started when I got behind the Lazer with the Velum and for some reason the Lazer just flew straight out to sea. I stayed on its tail and followed him, glad he didn't make it difficult. We progressed further and further and I asked /u/thejoyrider if i should keep following the Lazer. ""Sure, he will disappear any second now.""  Sure enough, he did. Immediately followed by a warning that I was out of the mission area and should return. Then everything went black and the fail-screen appeared....  That sparked a series of failed attempts, all for different reasons, causing a lot of Irish cursing and the aforementioned break. Just get back on the horse and try again!"

RedditDads,3dx9nn,Argo147,2,Mon Jul 20 13:33:42 2015 UTC,"So how do you tell if you receive an invite from a crew member?  I see all of the public invites popping up on the left side of the screen but there ain't no way I would recognize 99% of the crew members based on name alone.  I would have loved to run the Prison Break with RDAD's but I didn't get a chance to this weekend.  I tried running it with randoms and we did get as far as flying out of the airfield with the prisoner but got shot down while in the Velum and after that someone dropped off and I didn't feel like waiting around four a 4th random to join since we tried that mission 5 times prior.  On a good note, I did have some luck with randoms in completing the Fleeca job with a very patient 100+ guy -those hacking games weren't fun at all - and I completed the Series-A Funding job with a handful of Canadian teenagers that, despite burping and farting into the mic, were a pretty good group."
RedditDads,3dx9nn,rebo71,2,Mon Jul 20 12:13:55 2015 UTC,"Usually you can see a small RDAD-tag next to their names in the invite but sometimes that tag disappears for some reason, at least on PS3 it does."

RedditDads,3dx9nn,_Woodrow_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:07:18 2015 UTC,"Send PSN messages, bro.  Add players to your friends list since the crew list in the pause menu doesn't show everyone online so you can really see who is playing GTA.  I was in between heists and saw your invite, but it came up in the list that pops in after you finish a mission which means it's usually too late to accept it.  I waited a couple of minutes to see if it would come through again, but it didn't so I moved on.  Heists take a commitment to time so we always line these up over messaging instead of crew invites.  Also, and this is for everyone in the crew new or old, invites do not show that they are from a crew member and most of us are not joining random heists.  Don't assume everyone in the crew knows your name and will grab the invite.  I would have jumped in with you and know a few other players that were online that would have, too."

Although Im not experiencing problems with nat types, I only want to add my two cents.  in my case the relevant port list that did the trick was published on rockstar support pages.  The list included on xbox live support page do not worked for me.  If you check the port list on both sites, you'll spot a little diference on ports needed to map.  Again, great work Jpier!  EDIT: Update - This is not correct at all. This discrepance between ports is because I used the Xbox 360 list against Xbox One list hosted by Rockstar page. The point here is that the ports used by xbox 360 are different to xbox one."
