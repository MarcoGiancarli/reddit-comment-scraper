GunsAreCool,3e1oz9,BillySpeed,4,Tue Jul 21 09:05:55 2015 UTC,"You know, the institution of slavery that the black race has long believed to be an abomination upon its people may actually have been a blessing in disguise.  I mean, a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a two parent household than was an African-American baby born after the election of the USA's first African-American president.   Lets be real, America has been the best country on earth for black folks. It was here that six hundred thousand black people, brought from Africa in Slave ships, grew into a community of 40 million, were introduced to Christian salvation, and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known!  Lets take a moment and thank GOD for slavery, because if not, the blacks who are here would have been stuck in Africa!  And slavery wasn't all bad, if slave labor created wealth for Americans, then obviously it has created wealth for black Americans as well, including the descendants of slaves.  And we focus so much on slavery, far more of the African American community is being devastated by the polices of today than were being devastated by the policies of slavery.  I mean, the WORST thing that was done to black people since slavery was the great society programs. Am I right?   I mean if slavery was so god-awful, why didn't Jesus or Paul condemn it, why was it in the Constitution and why wasn't there a war before 1861?  The preceeding quotes were provided by the follow esteemed leaders: Rep. Jon Hubbard, Pat Buchanan, Michelle Bachmann and Rick Santorum, Rev.

It wasn't even about individuals. The arguments for and against at the time stemmed around the federal government taking away the states' right to have guns. The rationale for it was the British taking over militia stockpiles that the states had, not the British taking away individual's guns. They debated whether or not there would ever be a standing army big enough to overpower the states (and to show how little forward thinking they were, the majority thought there never would be, but still put it in as a safety measure), and never wondered about the individuals.
