CitiesSkylines,3e2zjm,Brysamo,14,Tue Jul 21 15:46:52 2015 UTC,this reminds me of my mod dream. all roads in cities skylines seem to use a bezier curve and a loft for modeling. we need a tool that will let you modify those points and curves after the fact.  http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/images/paths/cubic02.png  would seriously help my road OCD.

CitiesSkylines,3e34b5,FutureSynth,5,Tue Jul 21 16:24:40 2015 UTC,I enclosed the area with hydroplants and then I used waterpumps to drain it. I used 8 pumps per segment to drain them.
CitiesSkylines,3e34b5,Atys_SLC,3,Tue Jul 21 16:52:41 2015 UTC,If an area is surrounded by dry land and dams and you put water pumps in it you can drain it of water! Cool stuff.

I played a progression game starting in Little Darling, you can see the photos from the development and some info screens in this album  It may not look it from the city map pic, but it follows the same road hierarchy as shown in my traffic guides.  I learned two things building this city. First, when using the custom building themes there are fewer growable lot sizes and they won’t  fill all the nooks and crannies.  The second is loading all the vanilla, European, UK terraced, Trailer parks, and Neo-eclectic houses, and various high density custom assets saw the lag start to kick in a lot sooner.     If you’re looking for one of the attractions featured, I’ve tried to use the proper names to make it easier to search, but sort by unique building and by most recent and you’ll find it."

CitiesSkylines,3e2drs,BirdsOfHell,3,Tue Jul 21 13:27:30 2015 UTC,I used the Cimtographer mod to export an .osm file. I then used josm to open the .osm file and under View - > Map Paint Styles -> I used mapnik. Then I print it as a pdf after playing around with page size and margins.
CitiesSkylines,3e2drs,1Runar,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:24 2015 UTC,Thank you!
CitiesSkylines,3e2drs,1Runar,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:16 2015 UTC,"Amazing work yet again, I especially like how you handled the first original intersection. It also weird that your city turns out pretty much to what I had in mind when making the map, with the downtown area over on the peninsula etc, but I guess it's a pretty logic setup perhaps.   Any plans for future adventures?"
CitiesSkylines,3e2drs,1Runar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:38 2015 UTC,"The original intersection was like an orgy gone wrong. You start off with a simple three-way but before you know it you have a 4 and 1/2 way all over the place.  Next up I'm going to re-start Bruggesque, leaving the crappy map I made for a better Bruges like map. Course, I do have the map ready for GV7 and I still haven't hit the million mark yet. That said, I haven't opened Miho Bay. With Durban, Mangrove Beach, and this one, I could actually see the city in my mind and I couldn't stop till I got it out of my head. Maybe it's time to build an epic Asian city."
CitiesSkylines,3e2drs,boformer,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:14 2015 UTC,"It's cool that you kept the original Y-Stack and modified it instead of making a completly new one, even if it ended up a bit of spaghetti-orgy.  Had a look at Innerborg and yeah it's a good one, should be a pretty cool city, old-european-city-style I take it? Personally I really really like Miho Bay, it's a pretty small map to build on but I just love that lagoon and the Durbanesque shore with the mountain ridge.  I have two maps in the progress of being completed, the Egyptian red sea port of Safara and my take on the North Korean area around Songjon Bay and the village of Kowon."

CitiesSkylines,3e2ckb,bmulvihill,2,Tue Jul 21 12:40:24 2015 UTC,Whats the best way to connect two bi-directional six lane roads? Just a regular old stop light intersection or is there a better way?

CitiesSkylines,3e2ckb,xorana,4,Tue Jul 21 13:12:17 2015 UTC,Invariably it becomes a choke point and folks coming off the highway want to make both left and right turns onto the six lane road.  Some decide to use it as a u-turn.
CitiesSkylines,3e2ckb,mrmrevin,4,Tue Jul 21 12:35:37 2015 UTC,"As /u/bmulvihill said, you can just merge the highway on ramps with a 6 lane road.

CitiesSkylines,3e2ckb,tenbeersdeep,2,Tue Jul 21 12:40:20 2015 UTC,The trouble I have with this approach is that it doesn't stop the folks coming up to the six lane road from wanting to make both left and right turns.  so they'll stop at the intersection and traffic will back up on to the freeway while they sit there and wait to make a left turn.
CitiesSkylines,3e2ckb,Lilith42,5,Tue Jul 21 13:01:55 2015 UTC,Use traffic manager to stop them from turning.

CitiesSkylines,3dy1nf,SamuelYsc,132,Mon Jul 20 13:50:14 2015 UTC,Great city. I really do hope one of our amazing modders will soon come up with a building limit unlocker because this limit really halts these great cities' construction. We've already got a tree limit unlocker.
CitiesSkylines,3dy1nf,charlesnew1,52,Mon Jul 20 13:57:17 2015 UTC,I believe this is due to a hard limit inside the Unity Engine.

CitiesSkylines,3dy1nf,Kiloku,15,Mon Jul 20 19:31:37 2015 UTC,Theres a thread on the Paradox Forums where user KnightHawkTFC showed this is due to a limitation in the way the game is written (not Unity) and that it can be corrected - it even seems not that complicated to fix in the grand scheme of things. Impressively he managed to get a working correction (but with save broken) for a pre 1.1.1c version of the game but has done no more work on it as he wants CO to fix it properly themselves rather than it be a Mod.  Hopefully Paradox & CO have paid attention and this is on their to-do list at some point.

CitiesSkylines,3dy1nf,nitehawk39,11,Tue Jul 21 01:52:40 2015 UTC,The limit is probably their so the game doesn't break.  In the past the developers mentioned something about things like a million pop taking a toll on the game itself. The building limit and tree limit are probably for the same reason.
CitiesSkylines,3dy1nf,thisdesignup,3,Mon Jul 20 14:05:46 2015 UTC,They did it because the game engine renders each person/tree/building in real time. After a certain point (probably a little higher than the set limit) the engine simply can't render any more and it will crash.
CitiesSkylines,3dy1nf,MrNewReno,2,Mon Jul 20 14:54:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's probably why they did it. But they shouldn't make it too hard for people to unlock it."

CitiesSkylines,3dy1nf,davriguez,-7,Mon Jul 20 21:26:20 2015 UTC,"Same, that coupled with the traffic issues made me pretty much stop playing. It is asinine that a mod has to fix a game breaking bug regarding traffic. It's even more asinine this issue still exists after sales went above and beyond what the developers expected."
CitiesSkylines,3dy1nf,Gharst,36,Mon Jul 20 14:07:14 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what people are talking about when they complain about traffic issues. The stock game has an excellent traffic sim, especially comparing to other contemporary games.  You can have a 700k pop city and zone massive dense areas with tons of traffic, and still all trips go to completion. Buses, trains, metro, and walkways are all used, even including multiple transfers. There are a few irritating AI issues but you can solve them with thoughtful designs... even though the traffic mods allow much more customizability and micro-management, they are absolutely not needed."
CitiesSkylines,3dy1nf,2lost2bsaved,4,Mon Jul 20 16:04:03 2015 UTC,"traffic i can live with, but these limits fuck up everything and leave you with a non/half functioning city"
CitiesSkylines,3dy1nf,2lost2bsaved,4,Mon Jul 20 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair, these limits are impossible to reach without the 25 (or more) tile unlocker, which isn't an official mod. I don't count this against the game or Colossal Order."

CitiesSkylines,3dy1nf,Augustushomme,3,Mon Jul 20 17:06:40 2015 UTC,"The limit of dynamic in-game objects is due to the game engine, which is foundational.  Changes cannot be made easily (read: economically) when hundreds if not thousands of other processes within the game rely on it.  Since Paradox is a business at the end of the day, they have to weigh business decisions financially.  Considering this issue only truly impacts a small (yet vocal) portion of their customer base, it likely does not make economical sense to spend the manhours to fix the issue when ROI is low."

CitiesSkylines,3e2irn,Niclisten,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:16 2015 UTC,From my understanding the slow down of updates is due to the fact that they are all on vacation right now (they even posted this).  They have some plans for the upcoming gaming conference (can't remember the name right now)
CitiesSkylines,3e2irn,VoltaicShock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:16 2015 UTC,Updates were a little slow before vacation. And what this thread is talking about isn't new content - it's a revamp. I just think it's unlikely. It's a huge time dump :/
CitiesSkylines,3e2irn,VoltaicShock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:30 2015 UTC,True something like this is going to take time.  I'm sure it's not as easy as Build --> DX12 ship it out.
CitiesSkylines,3e2irn,VoltaicShock,2,Tue Jul 21 15:38:17 2015 UTC,"This game is more about CPU than GPU.  I have even seen my PC stutter and I haven't been able to do that.  I have played games, streamed music while playing, ripped a DVD, encoded a media file all at the same time and I couldn't cause it to stutter.  But once this game hit a certain population it will stutter ever so often."
CitiesSkylines,3e2irn,Jalatiphra,6,Tue Jul 21 14:47:45 2015 UTC,Most of the major improvement in DX12 is related to the CPU.  It solves the bottleneck that dx11 has with multi core CPUs. So it should be especially important for this game.
CitiesSkylines,3e2irn,maverikou,2,Tue Jul 21 14:57:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I was doing some more research on it and it seems it might help.  Would be nice if going to DX12 allows them to up the asset limit that is currently in place.
CitiesSkylines,3e2irn,gartenriese,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:21 2015 UTC,"it basically would make no sense, since i dont see any advantage in using dx12 for cities skylines. Granted with the new DX 12 API the rendering performance could be increased - but since cities is not really that heavy on the GPU - why would you bother to do so.  If your city gets big enough the cpu is working so hard on the simulation that its not able to do stuff the gpu wants. so framerate drops because your cpu is too slow.  It would make no sense to update a game to a new graphics API where the cpu is the limiting factor. The difference would be minimal.  However there is still a chance , because cpu usage will be reduced for rendering when using dx12 -> so it could potentially speed up the simulation a little.  However i dont think that this would be noticable. Maybe like 2-3 %. So its a money question: Should they put countless hours of developement/ testing time into a feature which does not bring any new stuff (non content features do not make good publicity) I think not"
CitiesSkylines,3e2irn,gartenriese,5,Tue Jul 21 13:58:28 2015 UTC,"A game like Cities: Skylines is one of the best examples of how DX12 can be used at its full potential and reduce CPU usage of graphics code by a lot.

I'm talking 50%+.   But if the CPU usage of graphics code is only ~20% total, 50% of that would not be that much anymore. And I highly doubt a game like C:S will get a graphics speedup of 50%."
CitiesSkylines,3e2irn,Socapex,3,Tue Jul 21 18:00:30 2015 UTC,Why only 2-3 percent? Multiple sources are claiming incredible performance gains for multi core CPUs. There 70% gains on a surface pro 3's fps. This would be especially important for a CPU intensive game like CS.
CitiesSkylines,3e2irn,gartenriese,2,Tue Jul 21 14:13:40 2015 UTC,"Your CPU can only have performance gains if it is used for graphical stuff a lot. Which is true for FPS games, but not for a game like C:S."

They dump their car pretty much anywhere, sometimes extremely far away from their home/place they are going. I've seen a car near an incinerator, in the middle of nowhere. On the other side of the city, where the cim was, and far away from both his home and job. Perhaps it was stolen. And when no parking space is available, they put it in their pocket."

CitiesSkylines,3e0v39,wacow45,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:49 2015 UTC,"All of the traffic is completely stopped in one lane. The point of a roundabout is to have constant flow.   It actually makes more sense for a driver wanting to turn left to enter the roundabout and take a left onto the straight section, than to actually use the roundabout.  If you want to go any direction, you have to go through TWO intersections, whereas a simple 4-way intersection would require only one stop. There isn't nearly enough volume here to justify anything other than a basic intersection or a small, 2-lane roundabout."

Put yourself in the trucks/cars shoes and it will help solve traffic problems as well. Also try and use the free form road tool to soften up those edges! Sharp edges slow down traffic quite a lot and aren't good when you have a lot. If your are trying to connect your industry to the highway I recommend you try and make the whole process a giant loop with one way roads. The way I make my industry is one highway going in which then branches out across many roads. Then comes back together for the way out. This helps divide traffic and keeps it flowing.
