crossfit,3e3ycw,ProfHotTub,12,Tue Jul 21 19:44:39 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll reply to this point by point. I'm critical of a lot of people and the ""sport"" as a whole as well. I make of it what I want to. Crossfit...is just the program and marketed name. It's the Kleenex of conditioning programs, if you will. It is entirely open to interpretation. You're going to find gyms where staff (I hesitate sometimes to use the word coach) will emphasize time over form, but that isn't the case everywhere by a long shot. The unique thing about Crossfit in the affiliate or franchise model is that each is really left to its own devices - unlike chain restaurants, where everything is basically the same regardless of where you actually are. You'll find two boxes across the street from each other that have the same basic equipment, but whose styles differ completely. One will be a solid barbell gym. Another will be a bootcamp-style box. You'll find some overlap, as there are some basic movements that everyone will probably get exposed to.   With that said -- you'll always find members who cheat reps or the movement in favor of time. I probably am not alone in saying that we all know some in our own boxes, and it's often known amongst our gym community who these people tend to be. Then there are those who are just plain hard workers. There are those who will make things harder for themselves, who have perfect form, who are the good runners, the good with gymnastics/plyo movements. It is what you make of it. Am I guilty of cheating a movement? Sometimes. And I'll look back at the workout later and chastise myself because it was stupid and egotistical. But that's just me. Can't say the same for anyone else.   Pull-ups - probably nothing is more contentious. This point has been beaten to death, but I'll summarize it. We don't need to say kipping pull ups because it is assumed. In Crossfit, a pull up is defined as starting from a hang and pulling your chin above the bar. However that's done, fine. The amount of work (force x distance) is the same - you're just involving more muscle groups and using momentum to cross that bar. Is it bad? It can be. No question about it. Hopefully you belong to a gym that won't let you do kipping pull ups until you can demonstrate enough control on the way down so that you're not ripping your shoulder out of its socket. I haven't heard people criticize our muscle ups because they're ""kipped."" Maybe you'll be the guy at the crossfit gym who only does strict pull ups, and that's what you'll be known for. Kipping is just faster and more efficient in terms of time - so long as the standards are fulfilled. And to be honest, kipping is more helpful when learning to do muscle ups on rings and the bar. It's helpful to know how to control your body and harness that kind of momentum to really do something bigger than a pull up.   Coaches - program however they want. This is why most members here will advocate that you ""shop around"" and find a coach you feel comfortable being in communication with. Sometimes we'll have workouts that specify strict pull ups. Or squat snatches instead of power. Or strict press instead of push press. Depends on what they're trying to fulfill with that programming. Coaches are not there to babysit your workout. If you want to cheat the wod, then that's up to you. I would hope that you have a relationship with said coach to the point where they're comfortable calling you out on it. But you're all adults, and you'll do what you want. (lightning edit: come the Crossfit Open (TM) or other competition, you'll get called out on it big time.)  The dogma is going to be different to each person. Some want to just their heart rate going, however that happens. Some want to forget all the bodyweight stuff and just weightlift. It is, what you make of it. Which is what it sounds like you're already doing. So, maybe in that sense, you are Crossfitting (TM) without even knowing it.   Crossfit Level 1 I think is unnecessary unless you're actually wanting to open a gym or coach somewhere. Otherwise, it's not particularly helpful.   Lightning edit 2: What keeps me in Crossfit, is the community of people at my local box. They're great people, and there's nothing like having people commiserate with/support you when workouts get shitty."

If someone just does random exercises on their own looking to progress in all of them gradually is that basically crossfit in nutshell? I guess I'm looking for some sort of programming concept that they follow. The way it appears to me sometimes is that a person who says they do crossfit will do a random ""name"" workout on one day then do olly or powerlifting on some other day."

crossfit,3e3ycw,reddit_again_really,3,Tue Jul 21 21:08:24 2015 UTC,"A number of people simply subscribe to the Crossfit.com main website and perform the workouts there, on their own. They don't have to belong to a gym, but have the equipment in a garage. Or do it at a globo gym. Whatever they have access to.   A lot of the pushback against Crossfit is that it consists of a lot of movements that people do already, and certainly don't need to be paying ~150 a month to do. The box community though, is the deciding factor for a lot of people.   But I would say what makes it a program is simply that there is a ""certification"" (the Level 1) and that you'll end up having to do some movements you haven't before. That's it. Everything else is independent.  In my opinion, a good Crossfit gym will have directed programming - a skill progression (i.e., muscle ups, or weighted pull ups, whatever), lift progressions or a power lift (Wendler's or 5x5) that carries over 2 or 3 months while sprinkling typical Crossfit conditioning workouts to keep things from being boring - or the part that really gets your heart rate up. A box I visited recently was doing 8 weeks of deadlift/muscle up. Twice a week, they would do deficit deadlifts 7x3, going up 5 pounds each session kind of thing. The other days they would practice on progressions for muscle ups (pull ups, weighted pull ups, dips, weighted dips, muscle ups, strict muscle ups, weighted muscle ups). Structure wise, it looked like this: 10 minute warmup, 30 minutes skill or strength, and 15-20 minutes for a conditioning piece (the workout of the day). I would say most boxes typically program like this. Strength/Skill followed by the conditioning portion. Some days we have a long conditioning piece that takes at least 35 minutes to do. Some days if there's 10 minutes left over, we do vanity workouts - like bicep curls and skull crushers (somewhat tongue in cheek)."

crossfit,3e3ycw,TheSensation19,5,Tue Jul 21 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"Go for it. Why not?  At the very least you will better understand what they are preaching at the highest level.   For me, I love Crossfit's ability to discuss all things fitness. I love cross-training and Crossfits popularized it. And because its become so big, so many masters of other sports or skills can always generate more education for Crossfit. That is why I consider it an Open source program. A world record jump roper can come in and talk about the skill of jump roping. A powerlifter can combine minds with gymnasts. And we are having actual guinea pigs working out using various programs with success and failures, so more discussion follows.   Also the business model I love. Let it be free.   Go in with an open mind and learn. To think you cannot learn a thing would be foolish"

crossfit,3e3ycw,ramblemn,3,Tue Jul 21 20:46:32 2015 UTC,"I really dk where this comes from. My guess is media's ability to scale up the facts into fiction.    I have been doing Crossfit on and off again for about 2 years. And never once have seen someone get hurt or was hurt. Not saying it never happened, but I never saw it or heard of it. I trained at 4 different gyms. I never got hurt doing Crossfit either.  Crossfit athletes, even the beginners, are some of the most prepared athletes I know. The community drives them towards a proper warm up which is what MOST people who ""work out"" dont do. Drives them to stretch regularly, sleep properly and works on proper form. I have seen a trainer tell someone do some crazy stuff, and I do not agree, but in the same gym I have seen the best trainer I have ever seen in all my years of sport training. Most trainers stress their members to go light if they even are hesitating a bigger lift."
crossfit,3e3ycw,ramblemn,2,Tue Jul 21 20:53:30 2015 UTC,"FYI. I have seen far more injuries from people playing soccer and hockey.   Lets not discuss serious injuries like broken bones which I see too much. In soccer I constantly see the same athletes getting hurt from basic running and sprinting done in a game. No one ever taught them how to properly run. They never ever warm up properly. Usually just stretch 5 minutes before, and get out there and run. They hurt it and though I tell them things they can do, they insist that rest is the only way. And yet, they rest it... feel better... then come back to soon and injure it again. And again. And again. Groins, Hips, Knees, Ankles. You name it.   Hockey not so much with this mild stuff. Mostly back pain from always being hunched over in skating position."
crossfit,3e3ycw,rpmbear,2,Tue Jul 21 20:57:02 2015 UTC,the injury rate is in line with weightlifting/powerlifting and lower than most regular sports
crossfit,3e3ycw,Bicepsandballgowns,2,Tue Jul 21 21:53:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything that /u/TheSensation19 has said, but I just wanted to add that people who do Crossfit recreationally and at an amateur level (i.e. not professional; i.e. not getting money or sponsorships from it) get injured the same way people who run/do gymnastics/etc. recreationally and at an amateur level get hurt: that is, they don't listen to their body, care too much about their ego and getting the best time/most reps/furthest distance, and keep pushing past their bodies' physical capacities, which results in them getting injured. Some CrossFit boxes endorse this die-hard balls-to-the-wall hard-as-a-motherfucker mentality, but from my experience – on this sub, at my CF gym, while dropping in – most CrossFit gyms try their best to steer themselves away from this sort of mentality, and most (recreational) CrossFitters would advise against going to a gym that doesn't make you feel safe, influences you to perform movements you're not ready for, and/or doesn't keep your long-term best interests in mind in terms of health."

What I also didn't add in my initial post is the shear number of coaches that I personally know who in my opinion have no business coaching these lifts.

(not just PR gains, but even sillly stuff like doing a handstand...)  If you are so awesome, then go coach."
crossfit,3e3ycw,NeededAnonymity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I'm not really looking to join a gym mostly because I have access to everything. Do you think a large part of crossfit is the community aspect versus people that do it on their own?  I do have a healthy ego and believe I am a little awesome so coaching wouldn't be out of my future. But I am definitely humble enough to learn from anyone. I mostly want to take the Level 1 to learn the methods to pass on to students and keep learning.
crossfit,3e3ycw,Daggon88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:34:05 2015 UTC,A lot of Crossfit is the community aspect in my opinion.  The relationship bonds are much closer than you would normally form in a typical gym (unless you brought friends you already knew along).  Several of the people that attend the same box as I do stuff outside as well.  Crossfit also has smaller classes in my experience.  You're more likely to get individual attention and critique than in a normal gym settings (unless you have a personal trainer).  It helps to keep you honest with the effort you give.
crossfit,3e3ycw,2001em2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:33:11 2015 UTC,I was going to say this. What I'm maybe unfairly reading between the lines is you find yourself to be more knowledgeable and more experienced then the coaches at gyms you've checked out. Go take classes. More then one. And come in with an open attitude.

crossfit,3e3ycw,guyonthissite,2,Tue Jul 21 20:14:17 2015 UTC,"You know how personal trainers are all different? Same for CF coaches. Mine luckily are emphatic on good form over time. Some folks get caught up in the competition and get sloppy, that's their decision. They have a lot of freedom within the CF methodology, which is great for great coaches and unfortunate for bad coaches who sully the CF brand.   Someone posted an article that made a decent analogy: strict (normal) pull-ups are to kipping pull-ups what a strict press is to a push press. Meaning one is better for developing strength while the other utilizes momentum from your body to move more weight faster. In a Metcon you want to keep moving and do more work in less time, so CF competitors adopted ways to do that with pull-ups. My coaches will often require us to do strict pull-ups for strength training however.   Just give it a shot, you're thinking too hard about it. There's the same cross section of people at a CF box as any gym: great athletes, koolaid drinkers, soccer moms, etc. for most people the enthusiasm comes from the results that a Globogym never delivered."
crossfit,3e3ycw,Solex159,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:12 2015 UTC,Thank you. Makes sense.
crossfit,3e3ycw,misteral,2,Tue Jul 21 20:15:03 2015 UTC,"Everyone is a critic of crossfit and that will not change when you join. To quickly answer your questions:  No all crossfitters do not stress time over form, but you will see this happen and it will make you cringe. If the coaches at the gym you are at do not fix this problem, find a better gym. Many gyms actually have Oly only programs and Olympic lifting has kind of exploded in this country alongside crossfit and the two are not mutually exclusive. ""Real"" pull-ups are known as ""strict"" pull-ups in the crossfit world and they are in most programs. Kipping pull-ups are just an entirely different movement used for a high amount of pull ups that wouldn't be attainable if you did the movement strict. No crossfitter is going to say that strict pull-ups are wrong and the general consensus is that you should have the ability to do 5 strict before attempting to learn the kipping pull-up. If a workout calls for 75 Pull-Ups, which is not uncommon, you would benefit from using the kip, but no one would fault you for doing the workout strict. One of a coach's most important duties is to modify for those that aren't capable. I would say that 3/4 people in an average crossfit gym regularly modify workouts down to their ability. A dogma... there really is none that is universal to all of crossfit. You can read what crossfit.com says, but even then a lot of people have discrepancies with that. It's just training and improving a little bit of everything with people around you that are trying to do the same. Some will take it more serious than others and some will be cultish about it and others won't. If I were you, I wouldn't waste money on a level 1 cert before you give it a good honest try and find a gym that you like. Given your background (I graduated with a kines degree myself), you are going to be very particular about the coaching and programming so take some time to find a gym that you are willing to go to."

This is why I am not in LA right now. I didnt want my life to revolve around crossfit anymore."

I say so far because half the events aren't announced so there's still the potential for something stupid, but so far there isn't really anything that caters to a particular athlete.

If it were televised on one of the million NBC sports channels that shows full coverage of non major road races or events like GRID then it would be much more likely to get full coverage for the week so they can fill air time. It's currently getting ESPN3 coverage which IMO is worlds better than full network coverage on some random channel no one ever watches.

You have some options to sub the breadcrumbs. Use almond meal, ground flax, or shredded zucchini for a leaner option. I'll use a costco pack of organic beef (21 oz I think) which is good for 2-4 servings depending on your needs. Healthier than regular meatloaf with pretty much zero change in flavor.  Enchiladas might be a little labor intensive but you can make them pretty healthy with beans, veggies, your choice of meat, corn tortillas. They're very microwave friendly for lunch at work.  I'll also cook off a 13x9 pyrex full of sweet potatoes or beets and keep them in the fridge. The potatoes are versatile and can be topped with eggs for breakfast or heated up for dinner. The beets can be cold on a salad.  And yeah, show cooker. The world is your oyster.

I love crossfit. I don't crossfit anymore for various reasons, but I think this statement is pretty off. If I had known when starting crossfit that this is what the most elite women of the sport look like I probably wouldn't have started to be honest. I remember starting to feel self conscious when my obliques and midsection began to turn more boxlike as I got more serious in CF, but was happy at the same time for starting to reach more PRs.   Crossfit women tend more towards ""I am amazed with the feats my body can DO"" vs the ""I am amazed with the way my body LOOKS"" mentality. It is a great shift in thought, but it doesn't come easy to women who start out with low self esteem. I think it's a huge mental jump you take as a woman who has just started working out and is working on body issues... Or maybe that shift in perspective was only paramount for me.

As someone who's always been a competitive athlete to some degree or other, I'm used to having big thighs and broad shoulders, and while it makes clothes shopping suck, it's always just been obnoxious (and part of my own body image issues.)   When I started doing Strongman, and trying to explain to my mother why I WANT to be able to squat 300#, she expressed grave concern that I'd get ""bulky"" (oh how I hate that word). I assured her that the amount of discipline required to get there is way beyond what I'm willing to put in. (Besides, I love beer.) But your point is a really good one - that the women we hold out as role models in the sport aren't the kind of body type that lots of women look for - which is fine - and they aren't the type my mom thinks I should be. Which is also fine. It just wasn't something I'd ever thought about before.   Sorry if this is rambly and nonsensical. On mobile and at work."

This is totally true for pretty much all of my friends and the reason none of them will do crossfit. They are terrified of even the possibility of looking like Camille whereas I kind of came into it idolizing athletes like her. My two biggest girl crushes are her and Ronda Rousey because I've always looked up to athletes who were great at what they do.   It just comes down to understanding what people's goals are. 90% of my friends workout to look better, whereas I workout because I want to C&J 200#. We're obviously going to train much differently and end up with different physiques simply because we have different goals."

We're focused on out-lifting runners and out-running lifters, going sub-5:00 in the mile and benching 300+ in the same day, and essentially specializing in not specializing.   Saying ""these women are stronger than you"" is a gross disservice to the participants: there are likely women in the field who have to sacrifice some overall strength just to maintain something else just as important in the Crossfit world. Saying these women are strong is such an obtuse perspective on what these women (and men) are: the fittest on the planet...(at crossfit) </waxing poetic about crossfit>"
crossfit,3dybiy,euthanatos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:26:51 2015 UTC,"Even if it's directed towards the average guy, it's pretty ridiculous. There are plenty of random guys in my mediocre globo gym every day who are stronger than many of the female CF athletes. The Rogue website lists Annie Thorisdottir as having a 255lb squat, which is well within the range of what a casually gym-going male could do. I'd venture to say that if you're a dude who is informed enough about lifting to be impressed by Camille's 108kg C&J, you can probably squat more than 255lbs."
crossfit,3dybiy,bigtonyt,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:27 2015 UTC,"You do realize that when an author writes ""stronger than you"" that they don't know you specifically?"
crossfit,3dybiy,euthanatos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:29 2015 UTC,"This doesn't have anything to do with me in particular. There are casual lifters in every gym I've ever seen who can squat 255 with no problem. An average guy who runs a decent strength program for a couple months should be squatting that. My skinny friend who weighs less than 160 was pretty close to that after running a linear progression for about two months, and he's far from a serious lifter.  The author of this article either:  1) Did not do the most basic research on the actual strength levels of female CF Games competitors. It took me less than a minute to find Annie's numbers on the Rogue site, and it took me another 2-3 minutes on the Games site to find out that the lowest squat number among the female competitors is 225lbs (not counting the  many people who didn't report a number).  2) Thinks that someone squatting in the low-to-mid 200s is ""stronger than you full stop"". Anyone who pays attention at a gym should be aware of how many fairly average people can do that.  3) Just doesn't care about the accuracy of his statements and is throwing out wild exaggerations. In a puff piece, I wouldn't be so surprised by this, but this guy goes out of his way to clarify and emphasize his assertion for a full paragraph, which rubs me the wrong way."
crossfit,3dybiy,achillesismyachilles,4,Tue Jul 21 16:44:52 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind that this piece was aimed at the audience of the Telegraph online, an English newspaper. Even the most ardent gymgoers in their readership are very unlikely to be able to C&J 110kg. Almost anyone who can (in the UK and USA, anyway) is likely to have at least heard of CrossFit already. It's an oversimplification, sure, but it gets the point across better than going 'The women are stronger than all but men who specifically strength-train.'"
crossfit,3dybiy,KarockGrok,2,Mon Jul 20 19:32:32 2015 UTC,"Let’s be clear: there's no hidden caveat to that statement. I'm not saying 'all of the women are stronger than you assuming you don't go to the gym', or 'all the women are stronger than you relative to their bodyweight'. No, what I'm saying is 'every single woman in the CrossFit Games is stronger than you full stop'.   He specifically says he's not putting any caveats to his statement. Yes, I'm being pedantic, but he's clearly overstating the truth just as much or more as I am being picky."
crossfit,3dybiy,achillesismyachilles,8,Mon Jul 20 20:10:05 2015 UTC,"So, we will be seeing you in the games next year? What stopped you this year?"
crossfit,3dybiy,KarockGrok,16,Mon Jul 20 17:43:58 2015 UTC,"The best women in CF wouldn't get out of regionals in the men's competition, and neither do I. I couldn't even RX all the Open events. Elbow problems have left me unable to practice muscle ups, so I can only do 1 or 2 at a time, and couldn't get any when I tried during the open.  Author stated all the women are stronger than you. No. They are FITTER than me. BY A LANDSLIDE – and let's not downplay that I'm saying they/she are/is, but from a pure strength standpoint, I strict press Camille's sloppy 155lb instagram PR for triples. Her C&J was listed at 108kg, mine is at 115kg. I'm just a regular dude who CFs three times a week and don't claim to be more than that, which makes the author even more incorrect in calling them ""stronger.""  Put me in the women's CF Games. I'd be in last place every event, by a lot, because strength is not the metric for Crossfit."

No. That's the exact distinction crossfit prides itself upon – the fittest in the world. The author is simply using the wrong word. No ill will here, it's just not true.   Show me a woman in the games who CF totals over 1000lbs. There's your strength metric – men do it all the time. ...and 80 Kipping pullups is not limited by strength nearly as much as by fitness, and it's still true that 108kg for a C&J is not stronger than all men."

crossfit,3dybiy,Sherbrooke,3,Tue Jul 21 06:38:17 2015 UTC,"Again, the author, in no uncertain terms, said there were no caveats to his statement including both caveats everyone keeps mentioning here in the comments. Look elsewhere where I've quoted it. Sure, they're pound per pound stronger, that is obvious. But the author said it didn't matter, and he's wrong. My beef is with a poorly researched and ineffectively written article, not the Games athletes."

If the audience is watching a group of athletes on rowing machines, or doing double unders, there should be a graphical or numerical representation.  I feel alone when other athletes at the box ask me if I saw so-and-so do such-and-such workout or movement. I answer, ""Who?"" I know of maybe a dozen Games athletes. Three went from my box this year, and there were others in the past. I support and encourage them, but I can't be bothered to watch the events on tv. They make me sleepy."

I'd seen the kipping videos, and knew all the criticisms and put-downs of kipping. I figured I could kipping pullups easily because I could do strict pullups. Wow was I wrong. I had no idea how hard they were to do properly. I'm just now getting to the point where I can get five or six kipping pullups strung together. I didn't have anywhere near the shoulder strength or mobility required to get into the hollow/arch positions. I've been working hard at this every time I'm at the gym and I'm finally making progress."

crossfit,3dxt14,Big_Shrimpin,14,Mon Jul 20 12:28:46 2015 UTC,My understanding is that it's a 5:4 ratio of rowing to running. So 125m row for each 100m run.
crossfit,3dxt14,badblood44,2,Mon Jul 20 12:33:18 2015 UTC,"Seems reasonable, thanks!"
crossfit,3dxt14,littlemrslarge,2,Mon Jul 20 12:57:23 2015 UTC,"Yep. We sub a 500m row for a 400m run, so 5:4 is correct."
crossfit,3dxt14,ampedtx,2,Mon Jul 20 13:01:24 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, is there a similar substitution for assault bikes?  I don't sub assault biking for running, but again, I'm just curious."
crossfit,3dxt14,badblood44,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:02:58 2015 UTC,"I actually asked the same question on the Crossfit official forums and was met with a resounding response of crickets.   Based on me and my anecdotal experience of using an Airdyne, it would seem the conversion rate would be somewhere between 2.7:1 and 3:1 ratio, airdyne distance to run distance.   But I've never seen any common sub like I have with rowing."
crossfit,3dxt14,power_yyc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:05:08 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I do whenever weather or injury makes running not an option.
crossfit,3dxt14,MBMathersIII,0,Mon Jul 20 15:16:05 2015 UTC,This is the easy answer.
crossfit,3dxt14,olenine,7,Mon Jul 20 18:07:51 2015 UTC,I phrase it as a 25% tax when you sub rowing for running; 1.25X whatever the run distance is.
crossfit,3dxt14,phrenic22,4,Mon Jul 20 13:17:03 2015 UTC,"Reading some of the replies here, I'm a little surprised.   Personally, I can row a 500 sub 1:35 if I'm pretty fresh. But just once. In a run workout (sets of 400s) I can maintain a sub 1:10 pace with 1:1 work to rest. I simply don't see the 1.25 conversion everyone else here is using. The amount of effort required to row vs run is significantly more (more muscle groups), but again, that might be just me.   With the 5:4 logic, you'd run an 800 against a 1000m row. Again, I can run an 800 in about 2:30, but my row lags really far behind at around 3:30.   If you're substituting for time, I'd simply look at what works for you. Do each once at about the same 80% effort, and see how the times check out. I'd have to run about a 1000 to match a 750 row or thereabouts.   Also, what is the workout? The other day we had run + muscleups in a workout - it rained, so we had to sub rowing. Rowing + muscleups is decidedly much harder since you're already taxing those pulling muscle groups from one to the other.  Or maybe it's that I just run fast."
crossfit,3dxt14,skushi08,3,Mon Jul 20 14:56:57 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm in the same boat as you. Most people do not take the same amount of time to run 400m as it takes them to row 500m, unless you're really that bad at running or that strong of a rower. I would just sub at a 1:1 conversion. 400m run is about the same effort to me as 400m of rowing.   I'm convinced everyone just quotes the 5:4 ratio because most runs are done in 1/4 mile increments and 500m is a standard preprogrammed distance on an erg, and most people are too lazy to program a new workout distance."
crossfit,3dxt14,phrenic22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:44:57 2015 UTC,that makes a lot more sense to me.
crossfit,3dxt14,jennifer1911,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:26:27 2015 UTC,"I think you may just be an above average runner, to be honest.    Although based on your numbers, you seem to be a pretty solid rower as well.  So perhaps at a certain level of fitness, the 1:25 ratio makes less sense."
crossfit,3dxt14,phrenic22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:29 2015 UTC,"My height disadvantage is really apparent while rowing - I'm just commenting that the ratio seems quite far off to me - but even when I consider the other members at my gym.   But I guess if it works for most, then maybe I'm just the weird one out.   a 2:00, 400m run is really an easy warm up jog. The equivalent effort (again, for me), might be closer to a 2:10 500m row. or even 2:15."
crossfit,3dxt14,iceberglived,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:20 2015 UTC,"No to crap on your parade, but a 1:35 500m row isn't very fast.  I think a closer analogy your run time would be in the 1:20-1:30 range.  But yes, you may just be an abnormally fast runner also."
crossfit,3dxt14,phrenic22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:41 2015 UTC,"oh, there's no doubt that I'm an ""meh"" rower at best. Besides wall balls, my height disadvantage shines through while rowing.   But keeping in mind some of the other members at my gym, a 2:00 500m row is a bit more strenuous than a 2:00 400m run. Even for the girls, a 2:00 400m run is easily doable, whereas a 2:00 500m row is at maybe 80% effort for them."
crossfit,3dxt14,littlemrslarge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:14 2015 UTC,"I think you're just a better runner than rower. I am. I run a 400 in about 1:30, but row 500 in about 2:00. Doesn't mean they're not equal work, just means I need to work on my rowing skills.  Edited to add: rowing should be more legs than arms. If you're taxing your pulling muscles on the rower, your form is wrong. I've been taught by rowing coaches :-)"
crossfit,3dxt14,phrenic22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"What everyone above is suggesting though, is that if you're subbing rowing for running, you should row further - i.e., if the run is 400, you should row 500 as a good sub.   But think about it. Take a boring conditioning wod: 4x400m run, 1:1 run to rest. At your pace, that's 12 minutes. They're suggesting that the equivalent is a 4x500m row. That would be 16 minutes. Clearly the two aren't equivalent.  Based on your own numbers, you could probably run a 600 in the time it takes you to row 500m. I would say your numbers are a pretty fair representation of most people I know in terms of the amount of time it takes for each of the conditioning pieces."
crossfit,3dxt14,phrenic22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"No doubt about it - rowing fries my legs. We have some D1 collegiate rowers back home for the summer, and they say my form's pretty good :-)  I'm just saying that rowing is more taxing on my arms/back than running is. It's most obvious when it comes to spacing out the run/row with muscle-ups in between. Did that this past weekend - it ended up raining and it too much longer than it should have."
crossfit,3dxt14,ad1d4s,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:35:36 2015 UTC,Just last week we had a row 5K/run 4k where you could do either.  I chose not to run (even though I would have easily ran the fastest time) so I could establish a new rowing PR.  Distance for distance my rows are faster than my runs.  But I could have easily run that 4K 2:30 faster than what it took me to row.
crossfit,3dxt14,thejoda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:07 2015 UTC,"It is not just time, but also work...rowing is a slightly easier overall movement than running. Don't get me wrong, I love rowing and think its a great exercise, but it is full body while running is more of a leg focused movement and not as efficient. This holds true even if rowing takes you longer over the same distance. That is the primary reason for the 5:4 substitution ratio. It is generally assumed that if you are subbing rowing for a run your time for the workout will be higher."
crossfit,3dxt14,JonK1980,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:25 2015 UTC,"In terms of freshness you're probably right but the ratio is used for workouts and aimed at when you're already fatigued.    Most people can row a 2:00 500m, and 1:45-2:00 is about right for a running section in a WOD when most are trying to get their breath back.  Agree on running/rowing fresh though."
crossfit,3dxt14,DontCallMeBenji,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:16:58 2015 UTC,"I ran track all through high school and college, and for me running is far easier on its own or with upper body movements mixed in. However, for some reason it's easier for me to row during workouts with lower body movements than it is for me to run. However, I purely think the ratio is on a situation and subjective basis.   The substitution I get really confused about is double-unders and single-unders. If the core movement is in the jump, and the secondary movement is in the rotation why is the sub generally three times. You jump the same number of times and rotate only 2 times more for a double under. Why not make the conversation 1.5 for singles?"
crossfit,3dxt14,phrenic22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"haha I guess here's the thing - at my box, subs are punishment gentle encouragement towards learning/doing the rx version. For example, we do 3 pullups / 3 dips as a sub for each muscle up. I don't find that to be equivalent in terms of effort or time, but so it goes."
crossfit,3dxt14,DontCallMeBenji,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:17 2015 UTC,"So it pushes people to attempt movements that they aren't strong or skilled enough to perform sooner than they should? Sounds logical... I really can't stand the entire concept of Rx. I've seen too many people miss the point of a workout because they had to go Rx. 30 minutes later and they have not only used the wrong energy system, but they failed to practice valuable skills like cycling reps properly and maintaining form. Makes sense for competitions, but people need to know their limits.   Edit: changed ""forces"" to ""pushes"" in the first line."
crossfit,3dxt14,phrenic22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:30 2015 UTC,"well, perhaps to some degree. I know it's a bad example, but I wouldn't really say that double unders is a thing you'd really get injured on going Rx. For that in particular, there's no real easing into it, you just have to try it one day. Sure you can get really good and fast at singles, but the difference in rhythm is pretty big.   The hope is that some of the subs mimic the movement enough so that you're building up enough strength to be able to get that muscle up. That's another example where I'd say, if you're truly ready and strong enough, that transition is nothing but a leap of faith that you're going to catch yourself in the bottom. I can't say I've seen many (if any) pretty 1st muscle ups that weren't just a bit of a struggle or surprise.  I completely agree with you when it comes to weights, however. Mostly because those can really mess you up if they fall funny."

crossfit,3e0jig,DRUNKOdin,2,Tue Jul 21 01:24:26 2015 UTC,"This exactly it. I am the same as you (i was 5'10"" and 145lbs when i started CF and can easily lose 4lbs in a couple of weeks if I don't consciously keep my calories up). At first, I gained about 8lbs over the course of the first 8 months then plateaud and went a few months without gaining much muscle mass (but was still getting stronger). I then made the conscious effort to track what I was eating and realized I was actually eating an average of 2400 calories a day, less than what was recommended for maintenance! So I started using my fitness pal to count calories and aimed for 3300 a day, using lots of avocado, healthy oils, sweet potatoes and rice to increase my calories and increases my protein intake to match. Within a month I went from 154 to 161. After you get your weight up, you still have to maintain a high calorie count."
crossfit,3e0jig,AHoserEh,6,Tue Jul 21 23:33:57 2015 UTC,"You don't eat enough, period. Start using butter and olive oil on everything, and eat about 125 g of protein a day.  You'll put on mass."
crossfit,3e0jig,admiral21,2,Tue Jul 21 02:53:25 2015 UTC,"Seriously, its this simple. Eat at a surpluss and put on mass. Eat relatively clean. Thats pretty much it for most people"
crossfit,3e0jig,d3xxxt0r,3,Tue Jul 21 14:30:39 2015 UTC,Track your calories and your weight. If you aren't increasing in weight on a weekly average basis then add more calories to your diet. Simple as that. Source: had the same problem
crossfit,3e0jig,SpongeyBoob,3,Tue Jul 21 08:32:14 2015 UTC,Diet first. After that you can think about adding accessory work. Simply adding an extra bicep and tricep exercise at the end of your wods will give you some good growth when you're just starting out lifting.
crossfit,3e0jig,DerNubenfrieken,2,Tue Jul 21 12:14:28 2015 UTC,"Being a naturally very skinny build I went from being around 154lbs to 168lbs from 2010 till 2012 through normal gym work and eating more than usual (I'm 5""11 and was 20 in 2010).  I then started Crossfit and I went from being 168lbs to 210lbs over the course of about 3 years. This was purely from Crossfit, weightlifting and strength training (with limited targeted cardio work). The initial weight gain came from, as every body else has suggested – eating everything... a serious load of chicken and also a litre of chocolate milk after big sessions! The result was packing on a lot of weight (and body fat). My main goals were to put on size and strength, as long as my performance was also improving as a byproduct I was happy.  Three years on, having done a couple of competitions, I'm really happy with my athletic progress and performance. I'm also quite a lot larger than a lot of the other athletes in my gym in terms of hypertrophy but carry a bit more body fat. As a formerly skinny person I was constantly looking to put on bulk, but now I've realised that it doesn't necessarily help my performance, I am now rowing in the mornings in addition to my normal training, and I am embarking on a nutrition programme to cut down some body fat to fuel my body correctly (rather than just by eating everything as before!).  Just as a side note in regards to the arms... my arms aren't massive and besides some supplementary tricep work, I've not done an arm work since I started Crossfit. Although everybody's physique is different, I still know quite a few Crossfit athletes who still train biceps :)  I hope that helps... for me becoming a Crossfit athlete has been way more satisfying than bulking up. 3 years on, I don't care about my size anymore I'm just looking forward to becoming as fast and strong as possible. Any physical change is a positive byproduct."
crossfit,3e0jig,Rex_00,2,Tue Jul 21 12:17:45 2015 UTC,"I'm 6' 1"" 185 and it's taken about a year to put on 5lbs. It's tough, and requires a ton of food. Also, limit Metcons and focus on strength training. In the context of WODs, try EMOM style workouts. Burpees and double unders dont really help with mass, they just burn calories.   Did I mention eating a ton? You'll be sick of sweet potatoes and eggs soon."

crossfit,3e0j3u,lafn1996,5,Tue Jul 21 03:23:41 2015 UTC,"The jar is round, the mug is round, they should call it round-tine.    You can't judge programming based upon 3 days. Most gyms program on a cyclical basis. Ask the coach what the goal of the programming is. Since you are an experienced strength athlete front squatting 315 for reps (wow, much strength, so amaze,) Crossfit may not make you stronger. But coupled with a good strength program you will see gains. Make sure whenever you question anything, after doing it for 3 days, and being completely new to something, and not really experiencing it, that you immediately come to the internet and complain about it. So to answer you're question, yes, you ARE crazy. Don't be rude can call people names."

crossfit,3e0j3u,iceberglived,3,Tue Jul 21 03:22:31 2015 UTC,"In my experience WODs aren't geared towards improving one lift or movement in particular, they're there to improve your overall fitness level if that makes any sense. My gym does lifting before our WOD, that's when we work on strength/technique. If you really want to improve your strength though, you'll probably need to be doing your own weight routine outside of classes.  To answer your question though, that definitely sounds like its on the tougher side of workouts, but nothing super crazy."
crossfit,3e0j3u,iceberglived,3,Tue Jul 21 03:26:11 2015 UTC,"The WOD is not really for strength. if you want more strength work, program it yourself as your box allows, or ask a coach to do it for you. If they wont, or won't let you, tell them to fuck off and go to a different box."

And i think that's also the reason why you are downvoted.  Heavy lifting is something you do on your own, or at lifting gyms or in Olympic Lifting classes (meh, sometimes not even then, mostly it's ""As heavy as form allows"") - WoDs are the high-intensity and overall fitness kind of thing that made CF so huge.  Occasionally you will have to find your FS 1RM - but you will also have to find your Max Effort Reps/ Max Reps for other lifts/ movements/ etc.  So yeah, you wanna lift heavy, go lift your 315 lb FS - but do it inbetween classes if the WoDs and programming doesn't suit you."
crossfit,3e0j3u,zata4,2,Tue Jul 21 05:44:40 2015 UTC,"If you want to lift heavy, join a barbell club or see if your gym offers an olympic/powerlifting specific program."
crossfit,3e0j3u,skushi08,3,Tue Jul 21 02:04:18 2015 UTC,If you have a question about the programming just ask the coach that's writing it. Coaches generally plan different cycles of varying lengths and not all are intended to just build strength in the big lifts. If he/she has sound logic for the workout design and goals they're working towards then that should be fine. If you're really concerned about your strength then supplement with your own squat program during an open gym time.
crossfit,3e0j3u,Danidreams,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:00 2015 UTC,"I totally understand why you think this is crazy; it's a long ass WOD without a lot of variety.  I actually think it is probably based on Nicole (AMRAP 20 of 400m run, max pullups.)  It's a really great WOD to push yourself mentally."
crossfit,3e0j3u,thegreyhoundness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:51:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds like classic crossfit. As it's a pretty small sample of programming and we don't know what the coach's goals and plans are, it's pretty hard to judge beyond that. As other people have said, if your goal is purely to get stronger on the four big lifts, then add some powerlifting to your life. Or just do powerlifting by itself."
crossfit,3e0j3u,misteral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:34:02 2015 UTC,"I think seeing what days each of these were scheduled would help.   CrossFit isn't for helping people improve big lifts. It's for conditioning fitness across all disciplines. Only heavy lifting is deadlifts? Go unbroken with 20lb wall balls between the 19th and 20th minute, and tell me they're not ""heavy""."
crossfit,3e0j3u,reg_sized_rudy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:27:19 2015 UTC,"Why are you hesitant to do your own thing during open gym? I'm assuming you're paying a decent amount of money for your CF membership, and part of that value is having access to nice equipment and open gym time to utilize it. If you're worried about stepping on the coach's toes by doing your own thing, run your goals past him/her and discuss what you can do during open gym to help you reach those goals. I understand the frustration of not having much strength work incorporated into the programming. If it continues, or if the coach makes it clear that strength work is not a priority, you might have to look at a different gym at some point. But don't make a snap decision based on your first impression. There could be a number of reasons why it's not being programming right now and unfortunately it sounds like you're too new to the gym to be able to make a solid assessment. Hang in there, squat in your own time, and hopefully have fun!"
crossfit,3e0j3u,lostmimic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:17 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, there are tons and tons of disciplines in Crossfit. Most boxes will try to get people doing all of them which can take time.   Yesterday for me was 10-9-...-2-1 burpee box jumps with 30 double unders or 90 singles (scaled) between sets for time. Today was 6 rounds of 6 HPC @ 165lb finish off the minute on the bike for calories and 2 minute break in between for calories.  Does your box do strength/technique work before the WOD? The box I go to does Warmup, stretch, strength/technique work then the WOD."
crossfit,3e0j3u,ArmyGuy2003,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"With that one I'd set a certain number of wall balls to complete before I went for a fast run. Figure, say 30 wall balls per 400m lap. Get others to join your rep scheme and you can have some fun. Push other members to challenge themselves to see 30 as an achievable number (to some it's more mental than anything). In that time, it's def possible to run 2 miles and over 150 wall balls."
crossfit,3e0j3u,continental-drift,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:26 2015 UTC,It's funny to see the assumptions people make online.

I have no qualms doing my own strength training and frankly that's what I have already been doing.   I don't presume to know more than the coaches; I am the guy who asks a million questions to better understand everything. That's what I'm doing here.  So thanks to the cultists who jump on anyone questioning CF methods.

crossfit,3dxs99,kjeserud,2,Mon Jul 20 12:50:37 2015 UTC,"We also get screwed on some weightlifting stuff, to be fair.  There was zero live coverage of the Pan Am Games in English."
crossfit,3dxs99,Juhneticks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:21 2015 UTC,"For sure, I was really hoping to see some, but no. TBH when it comes to weightlifting, unless Eurosport covers something I never see good coverage."

crossfit,3dxs99,ramblemn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:22:37 2015 UTC,Yeah we get hosed.  They want us to pay for it over here in the states.  I'll try a location blocker.

crossfit,3dxs99,Lekili,5,Mon Jul 20 17:40:52 2015 UTC,Here's a good list of times things will be airing List
crossfit,3dy7gi,ampedtx,4,Mon Jul 20 14:36:42 2015 UTC,"squeeze your glutes, squeeze them like you mean it. and keep your elbows pointed at the floor."
crossfit,3dy7gi,d3xxxt0r,4,Mon Jul 20 14:54:34 2015 UTC,"Deload to a weight where your technique is not impacted.  Keep working on mobility - do wall facing squats with a dowel / pvc to work on keeping your chest up. Do them frequently.  When you squat make sure to engage your lats / back (effectively your torso) as you take your setup breath. This will force you to stay more vertical.  Heavy goblet squats also help to focus on chest up, knees out and strengthening your torso using same setup breath + getting tight.  (these are things that have helped me, may not be applicable to everyone)"
crossfit,3dy7gi,DanaBug28,3,Mon Jul 20 15:13:49 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about deloading the weight.  Working with 50% just focusing strictly on form.  The wall squats and goblet squats idea is good too.  Thanks, man!  Much appreciated!"
crossfit,3dy7gi,superboomer23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:25:55 2015 UTC,how many times a week do you squat?
crossfit,3dy7gi,superboomer23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:49:33 2015 UTC,"Outside of metcons - between Front, Back and Overhead, it could be as few as twice, to as many as 3 times a week for strength training."
crossfit,3dy7gi,whidbeyislandus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:59:45 2015 UTC,maybe try to deload and do more often for crispy clean technique
crossfit,3dy7gi,forever_lurking1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:14:47 2015 UTC,"Sitting in a chair can kill your hip mobility. The couch stretch (preferably band assisted) is probably your best friend friend right now. Also, olympic wall squats: Lay on the floor and scoot your ass up against a flat wall. With your back on the floor, and your ass close to the wall, place your feet on the wall into a deep squat position. Add more stretch by using your forearms to drive your knees outwards. Hold for 2-3 minutes. This one really helps me because it replicates a perfect olympic (upright) squat position."
crossfit,3dy7gi,Solex159,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:09:42 2015 UTC,"Awesome.  I do the couch stretch for 2 mins a side on Deadlift day to help open my hips, and a lot of times the banded birthing stretch on squat day.  I'll add the couch stretch into my routine for squat day."
crossfit,3dy7gi,nowheyjose22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:22 2015 UTC,"Search YouTube for Chris Duffin teaching the squat for Mark Bell. Your back looks TOO arched and that may be why your ass comes out. Tl;dw of the video, keep a straight back, not an arched one.  But really watch the vid it helped up my squat by about 20 lbs just from the setup."
crossfit,3dy7gi,maduste,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:24:09 2015 UTC,Awesome!  I'll check it out.  Thank you!
crossfit,3dy7gi,d3xxxt0r,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:31:31 2015 UTC,Form always goes a little bit when you are close to your max. At least that's what I've seen at my local box. Just have to be careful and use equipment to minimize chance of injury like belts.

crossfit,3dvy6u,bynummustang,6,Mon Jul 20 18:28:13 2015 UTC,Why does he run like a stick figure?
crossfit,3dvy6u,BrittainTheCommie,6,Mon Jul 20 02:45:43 2015 UTC,"I doubt it's him actually running, I don't think Castro could clear any kind of hurdle without his family's money"
crossfit,3dvy6u,DuskytheHusky,22,Mon Jul 20 08:28:53 2015 UTC,"I get that Castro has the personality of a douchenozzle, but the guy is a former Navy Seal.

crossfit,3dvy6u,SLEEPER455,6,Mon Jul 20 11:21:00 2015 UTC,"Totally, I just like ripping on the guy, because he is a complete fucktard.   Genuinely though, having watched a bunch of videos where Castro is working out, those hurdles look too high for him to be clearing with such ease. I just reckon he gave the camera to one of the demo team"
crossfit,3dvy6u,DuskytheHusky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:40:19 2015 UTC,"Nah those hurdles are only 39"" tall if those are standard foam training hurdles, which isn't difficult to clear if you're actually sprinting."
crossfit,3dvy6u,skushi08,-3,Mon Jul 20 17:59:06 2015 UTC,Thank you. I agree 100%.
crossfit,3dvy6u,prbrit,3,Mon Jul 20 13:10:05 2015 UTC,"Can we go ahead and give this event to Dan Bailey? With his collegiate sprinting experience, I don't see how he doesn't win this."
crossfit,3dvy6u,mrigney,4,Mon Jul 20 05:13:02 2015 UTC,"i'd say ez muhammad and scott panchik both have as good a chance at winning this one. if it was just run fast in a straight line i'd go with dan. but this one comes down to executing the cleanest run, which will make it a bit more interesting."
crossfit,3dvy6u,garagewolf,4,Mon Jul 20 07:05:50 2015 UTC,"It is ""who can run the fastest in a straight line"" to some extent, though, isn't it? From the video, it basically looks like the zig-zag course + a 60 yard hurdle event. Dan wasn't a hurdler as far as I know, but my guess is that he's decently proficient at hurdles (at least comparable w/everyone else at the Games). Seems like over that last 60 yards he could have a huge advantage."
crossfit,3dvy6u,mrigney,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:58:45 2015 UTC,400 was his best distance if I remember right.
crossfit,3dvy6u,bynummustang,2,Mon Jul 20 18:26:24 2015 UTC,And didn't Spencer Hendel do well during the O-course 2 years ago (or 3 or whenever).   It'll be good to see how the people move.
crossfit,3dvy6u,JonK1980,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:25:55 2015 UTC,Marcus Hendren was the only one to beat Bailey 2 years ago and he didn't qualify. I'd say it's Bailey's to lose.
crossfit,3dvy6u,alavoil,0,Mon Jul 20 15:34:23 2015 UTC,"I get that Maddox is older but he was also a football player. I used to run the 400 same as Dan, and I can't call myself a sprinter in good faith. If anyone has 100m sprinter speed I'd say they have the edge."
crossfit,3dvy6u,bynummustang,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:37 2015 UTC,I wonder if there's a time penalty for knocking hurdles down? That'll give a pretty big advantage to anyone with a track and field background that actually knows how to sprint efficiently while hurdling.
crossfit,3dvy6u,skushi08,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:00:48 2015 UTC,Zig Zag Sprint results from 2013. 3 of the guys qualified this year and I have a feeling they'll be back in the top 5 on this event.  First: Marcus Hendren 0:11.1 Second: Dan Bailey 0:11.1 Third: Aja Barto 0:11.2 Scott Panchik 0:11.3 Michael Mogard 0:11.6 Ben Smith 0:11.7
crossfit,3dvy6u,vroflraptor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:22:22 2015 UTC,Relevant.
crossfit,3dvy6u,barnfagel,-4,Tue Jul 21 02:31:36 2015 UTC,Anyone else want to call bullshit on this given that Dan Bailey is seen doing basically these exact movements in the video that CrossFit HQ just released? Do certain athletes get an early inside scoop on some of the workouts and/or equipment that other athletes don't get to benefit from?  Start around 20:35 of this video http://youtu.be/Uu7ZqjIzfvQ   (I'm mobile and can't link to the exact timestamp)
crossfit,3dvy6u,rmm5t,9,Mon Jul 20 02:00:06 2015 UTC,This workout had been announced previously.
crossfit,3dvy6u,kplee,3,Mon Jul 20 02:04:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. That helps explain it. Any dated links showing when that workout was originally announced? I'm happy to revoke my original cynicism.

crossfit,3dym3j,Shes_the_Cheese,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:36:34 2015 UTC,Just found this site and ordered two. Tons of selection and they work well. I bought one for standard use and the other I only wear during double-under workouts. So far so good!
crossfit,3dym3j,kaslokid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:32 2015 UTC,Thanks! I just ordered one from Junk and we'll see how it goes!
crossfit,3dym3j,LatinPassion87,3,Mon Jul 20 19:37:10 2015 UTC,I started using short sleeves from old shirts i wasnt wearing then i found a good one on amazon. I sweat ALOT and they work great and great price.  Bondi Band Solid Moisture Wicking Headband http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JQXSRU2?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00
crossfit,3dym3j,ampedtx,2,Mon Jul 20 18:38:54 2015 UTC,"I have two of the Rogue tapered Bondi bands.  I like them.  I think they're like $9 a piece.  They help keep the sweat out of my eyes.  They don't look as fancy and hip as the Junk bands, but they functional."
crossfit,3dym3j,rattledamper,2,Mon Jul 20 18:59:02 2015 UTC,I use Halo headbands.  They work pretty well.  My main problem with them - and I have this same issue with the Junk and Hylete ones - is the damned brand name on the front.  I find that super obnoxious.
crossfit,3dym3j,dimsum_cart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:40 2015 UTC,I've been wearing ones from Hylete. They're not cheap but they are lightweight and super absorbent. I used to have sweat streaming down my face throughout each workout but this stopped once I started wearing these.
crossfit,3dym3j,sdotdebow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:14 2015 UTC,"I got them too cause they came free with the flag shorts, they seem to work well and dry out quicker then my shirts"
crossfit,3dym3j,bigtonyt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:37 2015 UTC,"I will second the junk bands. I got them from the Rogue site, black ones were like two for $9 or something. Work great"
crossfit,3dym3j,Tj_na_jk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:15 2015 UTC,I have the junk bands and the Hylete bands. They all do the trick for keeping sweat out of my eyes. The junk bands are a little thicker and hold moisture better. The Hylete bands dry quicker. I have the Hylete in both tie and infinity style. I prefer the infinity style for ease of use.
crossfit,3dym3j,Steveesmuyguapo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:41 2015 UTC,"I have like 3 reebok ones and a rouge one, most of them are junk brand head bands... Are they for guys... IDK but they keep the sweat out of my eyes for a while."
crossfit,3dylcu,HunterTC,5,Mon Jul 20 16:19:04 2015 UTC,"This usually depends on the gym's location and how many drop-ins they get.   We're located in downtown Chicago and see a lot of drop-ins from folks on vacation and in town for conferences.  We used to have a free drop-in policy (just buy a shirt if you want to support the gym), but, once we got to the point that we were tending to see multiple drop-ins per class throughout the day, we made the decision to start charging.  This isn't necessarily greed. Having revenue from drop-ins does certainly help cover costs and, believe it or not, most gyms need all the help they can get. We also wanted to start filtering drop-ins a bit to keep the volume under control for our normal members - especially since drop-ins can be disruptive to classes if they're not experienced in training. If someone is willing to pay a small fee, they're usually more experienced and dedicated and are less likely to disrupt classes."
crossfit,3dylcu,Southloopsc,4,Mon Jul 20 19:48:39 2015 UTC,"I've seen a fair variety ranging from first class free, buy a tshirt, buy some coffees, or pay $10-$30"
crossfit,3dylcu,Flowseidon9,3,Mon Jul 20 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"We don't charge at all for a single drop in. The proper etiquette is for the athlete to buy a shirt or something.  If it's multiple drop ins, we charge.  We also aren't in a ""hot spot"" so we don't look at drop ins as a revenue creator."
crossfit,3dylcu,SnatchAddict,2,Mon Jul 20 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"Drop ins range anywhere from free, to the the purchase of a t-shirt, up to $30, and sometimes even a Starbucks gift card  Edit: NorCal changed it from ""Starbucks Gift Card"" to ""Gift Card of your choice"" at some point since Friday lol"
crossfit,3dylcu,vroflraptor,6,Mon Jul 20 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"Why would it be free? You're using the facility, the equipment, maybe a bit of coaching?   How are you surprised  they charged you?   ...?  ?  They have bills to pay. Rent, insurance, payroll, utilities, equipment. Should you just use all of those things with out paying a fee?  ...?  ?"

crossfit,3dylcu,ronindog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:46 2015 UTC,Nope.  You are a very confused and very 1 dimensional thinker by your original statement.   Your response of why anyone would ever give free dropins since they have bills to pay proves you have an elementary mind.  fuck you too
crossfit,3dylcu,ronindog,0,Tue Jul 21 14:36:05 2015 UTC,"Good business model. Take for example a gym in a city that receives tons of drop-ins. Don't charge and hope they buy a shirt. Good idea.  Now you have drop-ins using equipment, space, possibly coaching, and you're not making a dime. But hopefully they'll buy a shirt. Lol. Good idea newb . I'm done talking to fools"

What I have noticed the last 2 years, most gyms are not free. I used to just buy a t-shirt, but it seems now days its $20-$30 bucks."
crossfit,3dylcu,vision1915,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:38:11 2015 UTC,"Some / many boxes do free drop ins.  We do at my box. I talked to the owner once about it, the impact of drop ins is so low on the gym that not charging for 1 time drop ins lets him differentiate the box from others in the area. A lot of people end up buying a shirt.  Myself, I've dropped in at places where there's been a drop in fee, usually includes a shirt. Places that don't charge I'll always buy a shirt from. From my experience large boxes or places with more notable coaches / people charge more"
crossfit,3dylcu,misteral,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:46:29 2015 UTC,"Not uncommon, I have found that is a $20-30 fee or a T-shirt, and some have the first class free and then a small fee for the rest.  I usually contact the gym in advanced to find their drop in policies. Not everybody accept drop ins, and sometimes you can get a deal if you are doing more than one class."
crossfit,3dylcu,bynummustang,0,Mon Jul 20 16:40:48 2015 UTC,Yeah i contacted about a drop in and there was no mention of cost. I should have asked instead of assuming.
crossfit,3dylcu,T_Rash,2,Mon Jul 20 17:05:45 2015 UTC,"Did you try looking on their website?  Many gyms that charge a drop in have it clearly listed on their site.  Probably 2/3 of the gyms I've dropped into charge some sort of a drop in, with the majority of them being $10-20 (or a shirt, which comes in around the same price usually)."

crossfit,3dyerg,biceps_tendon,6,Mon Jul 20 19:12:35 2015 UTC,"Doubtful, even if the sport became popular enough.  Crossfit has a stranglehold on the brand so that any sanctioned competition would have to be separate from ""crossfit"".

crossfit,3dyerg,diestache,5,Mon Jul 20 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"With the way crossfit currently handles their branding/sponsorships and the relationship between HQ and PR, they will never become a big name sport at all. They're constantly getting in their own way."
crossfit,3dyerg,DerNubenfrieken,4,Mon Jul 20 16:43:22 2015 UTC,No. They won't pay the fees to use the name or branding.

crossfit,3dyerg,Squatsandoat,4,Mon Jul 20 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"No. No, never.  You realize that at least in terms of open participation, there are only 200k people, in the  entire world. That's World Wide. This ""sport"" is a small small dot in the world. It's fun and I like it but it will never grow to be a truly national sport, like lax, gymnastics, tennis, swimming, or hell, even fencing."
crossfit,3dyerg,BrittainTheCommie,3,Mon Jul 20 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"Would that benefit CF-HQ and Reebok? I think so, more members and certs = more income. Would colleges let CF certs be legitimized? No. They're glued to their science degrees. It'll take time for this to change. Would colleges benefit? No, athletic departments cost schools money. I personally think college athletics (minus the big sports with tv revenue) will continue to fade away and clubs will grow.   4. The big question: Do advertisers want it? I don't think so, too small a sport niche vs. ""Under Armor & Football"" or ""Nike & Track"" and the like.   Personally (this may sound bad), I view CF as a great post-college sport. It helps adults live local lives and build local community and know your neighbor (vs internet global community ""relationships"" via Facebook).   It feels really weird seeing high school students getting into CF. I used to do triathlon, and I felt sick seeing 15 year olds show up racing $10k bikes teched out by mom and dad.  In Castro we trust."
crossfit,3dyerg,MBMathersIII,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:29 2015 UTC,"the way the Russells/HQ have been shitting on NSCA, Musclepharm, Gatorade, Nike, etc. makes it very doubtful.  All of these companies and organizations have affiliations with NCAA."

Oh and the grid league. However, as a teen who is going to college soon I like the idea of an on campus box. I've looked at one school that has one and I assume lots of other schools do."
crossfit,3dyerg,CFisLife212,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:51:46 2015 UTC,"Lolz. Considering there's already teen athletes ""sponsored"" I'd say fat chance in Hell.

crossfit,3dyerg,skushi08,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:19:16 2015 UTC,"No. It would ruin the sport. Let's assume it became a varsity sport and colleges started minor reciting. Now you have these crossfit training centers with access to state of the art facilities,  coaches and time. Once the first few classes leave college,  all of a sudden these athletes dominate the games. Down the line, these crossfit hubs will be producing tons of high quality athletes.
