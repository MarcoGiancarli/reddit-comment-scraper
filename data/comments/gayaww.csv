gayaww,399lcj,brlrussell,5,Wed Jun 10 06:20:16 2015 UTC,Ewwwwwwwww.... Windows 8.
gayaww,399lcj,majeric,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:56:17 2015 UTC,"Waaayyy better than 7 though! I've been pretty happy with it so far, its quick and everything works pretty well with it"
gayaww,399lcj,majeric,2,Wed Jun 10 22:53:40 2015 UTC,"Really, 7 is pretty stable (Fixing all the things wrong with Vista). I was really only kidding about 8. (Just thought myself funny).   8 tried to do something different. They might have tried too hard. We'll see what 10 has to offer."
gayaww,399lcj,Computerme,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:56:44 2015 UTC,"Was never a fan of 7 and for personal use I found the changes in 8 and 8.1 to be refreshing, but for business use I think it would be pretty irritating with the metro start menu thing. I was lucky enough to have a computer that was able to handle the behemoth that Vista was so it rarely gave me issues lol"
