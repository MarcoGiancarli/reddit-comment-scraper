OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,alleigh25,-2,Sun Jun 7 03:09:23 2015 UTC,"Im from LA and we don't have a football team, but we have 3 teams in California. If you just went with the closest team, everyone in LA would be Charger's fans but there are hardly any Charger fans in LA. The only Charger fan I know is someone who grew up in Northern CA, even though the Raiders and 49ers are both located in Northern CA. Some of my buddy's are Raiders's fans, my other buddy is a Steeler's fan and I like the 9ers cuz that was my dad's favorite team.  There's 50 states but only 32 football teams, and some states have multiple teams (Texas, California, etc.).

I tried to look it up on the off chance someone has actually looked into it, and it turns out there is actually a map of most common favorite teams by county.  For the most part, it is simply the closest team, except:   The Cowboys, Steelers, and Packers have a lot of fans outside their region (for example, most of Nevada inexplicably likes the Cowboys) The Raiders fans live farther away from Oakland than you'd expect The Jets don't seem to have even a single county (though they're also from the only city with two teams)   There are random counties here and there that don't match the surrounding area, but they're all either one region over, like the northern CA county that likes the Raiders, or the three teams I mentioned (unless I'm overlooking something or mixing up the annoyingly similar shades of red and blue).  However, that map is based on Facebook likes, so it may not be a wholly accurate representation."

According to the map no one like the Cardinals outside of Arizona, but like half the country is either a Broncos' or Cowboys' fan haha.

OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,-oligodendrocyte-,-9,Sat Jun 6 13:18:44 2015 UTC,For children?
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,Kenny_Twenty,7,Sat Jun 6 18:28:30 2015 UTC,"If you know it's a child, use 'girls'; if you don't, use 'women' and context clues will take care of the rest. This isn't really that hard. Is English not your native language? Using 'women or girls' isn't any different than using 'men or boys', i.e., err on the side of older/more general (in general usage, it's more polite) and adjust based on context."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,-oligodendrocyte-,-13,Sat Jun 6 21:39:59 2015 UTC,Why not use 'female' when it's the most accurate word?   Answer the question.
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,Kenny_Twenty,14,Sat Jun 6 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"Because it's not grammatically correct outside of specific technical contexts. In general usage, 'female' is an adjective, or a descriptor of something else (i.e., ""a female patient"" or ""the female subject""). I mean, if you prefer to go through life sounding like a research paper describing another species, go for it. I really don't care, I was just answering your question.   I'm guessing, from your ""Answer the question"" demand -- which prompted me to look into your posting history -- that you're actually looking to pick a fight. Preferably with a woman. I'm not going to give it to you. Go back to your crimson brethren, and please, continue calling women ""females,"" it's a useful heuristic for who's not worthy of attention."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,-oligodendrocyte-,-4,Sat Jun 6 23:17:18 2015 UTC,"Because it's not grammatically correct outside of specific technical contexts.   This is in no way true. Sorry, but it's a moment's work to open any dictionary and see that you're making it up. It's weird and awkward to refer to women as ""females"" casually without good reason, but it's not a grammatical issue."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,almillarskovich,3,Tue Jun 9 09:21:59 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you are getting downvoted. While female is primarily used as an adjective, there is nothing grammatically incorrect with using it in its noun form. That being said, it can be a bit cringey."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,bluedreams23,-10,Sun Jun 28 16:43:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't know you were a woman, nor did I wanna pick a fight with you. That's why I didn't respond to your thinly veiled insults in your last post, you silly goose.   I'm not a red pill zealot but I do like their view on self improvement. It makes me sick when I think people are resorting to it because they want to get back at women for whatever reason, though. But I'm not sure why I should be explaining myself to you when I really was only asking straightforward question.   Feel free to hate me. I won't hate you back. I am thankful that you answered my question, finally. I honestly did not realize it was an incorrect use of the word. You taught me something. Thank you.   Have a nice day."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,Kenny_Twenty,2,Sun Jun 7 00:16:25 2015 UTC,"I honestly did not realize it was an incorrect use of the word.   It is not. You should probably avoid it because it can be awkward, but surely you have access to a dictionary and easily confirm that the parent poster is entirely mistaken."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,almillarskovich,-4,Tue Jun 9 09:26:15 2015 UTC,I'm not gonna avoid using it just because aggressive social justice warriors don't want me to. There has to be a good reason. I don't agree that it's awkward or pejorative.
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,Kenny_Twenty,-4,Tue Jun 9 12:15:28 2015 UTC,"Because it's something stupid and irrelevant people can use to feel morally superior. Seriously one of the stupidest circle jerks around, once you start paying attention to it you'll see ""females"" being used in this context by all kinds of people and organisations. But why would you have to criticise any substance in a message when you can just do a quick ctrl+f for females and call it a day."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,Fake_Unicron,-3,Sun Jun 7 08:02:56 2015 UTC,"No. That's not the reason. It has nothing to do with superiority. The reason is that it's an incorrect use of the word. It's not offensive, though."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,Kenny_Twenty,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:46:21 2015 UTC,"Why do guys on reddit fight so hard for the word females? 99% of the time, women don't care if you use the word women, young women, or girls, but the assumption is always made that they'll flip or snap at you for it.  Females is strange. Referring to girls above the age of 15 (which is generally the type of ""female"" we're talking about) as women is not.  Nobody ever has the argument of ""males"" because no one uses it the same way.   Sorry, rant over, it's just so strange to me."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,mosdefin,2,Wed Jun 10 14:39:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not fighting  for  it. It's already there. It doesn't need to be fought for.   I'm just wondering why people like you are fighting  against  it.   In my opinion it's self defeating. You give the word this negative connotation when there wasn't really one before. I'm sorry, I don't mean  you  specifically. It's like feminists create a new way to feel insulted just to perpetuate this adversarial relationship with men who don't even know they're insulting anyone because they're just using (in general) what they believe the correct word is.   It's counterproductive in my opinion. Either way, I don't mean any disrespect to you or any women. This post has been somewhat critical of (some) feminists but plenty of men are just as wacky.    EDIT: I'm too dumb to use italics properly so consider the source, I guess."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,Kenny_Twenty,-11,Wed Jun 10 15:51:32 2015 UTC,"Some people greatly dislike the terms male and female. Why? They're either Tumblr users or assume that the catchall 'male' (men and boys, and even neckbeards) and 'female' (women and girls and legbeards) are some how rude. Now, when it comes to people that are transgender male/female can be a little confusing as the two biological sexes are male and female but they're also the names for two genders... Ah shit I stopped caring as soon as I started. Point is some people don't like how some words sound...   tl;dr? Reddit is now tumblr. Rip in pieces factual conversation and hello butthurt downvoting :("
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,Ulkreghz,-1,Sat Jun 6 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah whats up with that. Its not like a racial slur or derogatory term, its just denoting sex... How is that something to get mad about?"
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,CarlosSpcyWeiner,4,Sat Jun 6 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"So, it's not something most get mad about. Reddit's a bit prone to exaggeration or to rely on Buzzfeed/tumblr as a way to measure how people feel, but people don't think of the word ""female"" as comparable to say, the N-word, if that's what you're thinking.  The issue is more the way some will call women ""females,"" but in the same sentence, call men ""men."" Here's a couple examples.  Female and male are meant to be descriptors or used in journalism/scientific research. Like:  ""Two female pirates were captured and executed on the Hamburgler border for trespassing.""  ""Why are there more male coaches for women's teams than there are female coaches for men's teams?""  ""Studies show that 96.3% of females prefer 5 Guys, compared to the 87.5% of males who prefer In-and-Out.""  This is the generally accepted usage. They're clinical words, meant to signify objectivity or an otherwise not casual setting.  On the internet, it's generally more of a:  ""Reddit, why are females so emotional, and why are men bastions of logic?""  ""I saw a really cute female the other day. What do you guys do when you're trying to hit someone up?""  ""Why are there more men in STEM fields and more females in artistic careers?""  It's an unusual habit that quite a few people have picked up, and it's rare for it to be the other way around, which is why some people have become annoyed by it.  tl;dr It's not so much what's said, so much as how it's said. It's not offensive so much as an odd thing to do. It's a little dehumanizing when we already have a word for a female human. And the idea that women will be offended over being called a woman or a girl is grossly overblown."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,mosdefin,0,Wed Jun 10 15:14:56 2015 UTC,I get that. But there doesn't seem to be an alternative. So that's a problem for people taking an issue with it.
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,Kenny_Twenty,0,Sat Jun 6 18:29:22 2015 UTC,"Your comment isn't actually factual. If you're actually interested in knowing why people dislike the terms (outside of the generic ""anyone who disagrees with me must be from tumblr, there's no possible other explanation"" whine) I'd be happy to explain. If not, whatever."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,mosdefin,-1,Wed Jun 10 14:41:52 2015 UTC,"I went through your post history to see what sort of conversation this would develop in to but it looks like you'll just get upset because somebody used a word you don't like. Female and male are words used primarily to refer to the sexes male and female. Sometimes they are also used to refer to genders. There's nothing wrong with calling people male/female. I, myself, am male and judging by your response you're a femalegirl (sorry, forgot that female is bad because... you said so...)."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,Ulkreghz,2,Wed Jun 10 22:50:41 2015 UTC,"Sigh, typical illogical, emotionally charged reddit tier attack, what a shocker. I don't expect better from teenagers."

OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,greenshrubbery,2,Fri Jun 5 21:32:51 2015 UTC,"Yes but I will say that he tweeted that after getting frustrated because he got a B on a history test or something. That tweet was definitely blown way out of proportion and I thought he was a smart, funny kid (until now)."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,poodlepaws,2,Fri Jun 5 21:27:19 2015 UTC,"He's interning at some Fortune 500 company, right?"
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,CarlosSpcyWeiner,-2,Fri Jun 5 21:28:15 2015 UTC,"Hell of a player tho. He was a 3rd string QB that never started a game, got his chance to step up in the Big 10 Championship and 3 games later he led his team to an upset victory over a heavily favored opponent in the national championships. Thats the stuff they make movies about.  I dont think that tweet makes him a bad person tho,  it was just a joke. Definitely not the kind of joke you should make as a high profile athlete, seeing as how he just alienated half of the nation's fanbase but still, seems pretty harmless to me."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,CarlosSpcyWeiner,6,Fri Jun 5 22:19:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think these tweets make him a bad person, but it is undeniable that it is indicative of a backwards mentality that I just cannot appreciate in anyone. It's a joke, but it's definitely grounded in his real views.   I still think he's a hell of an athlete, but if I were a Buckeye this would put me off from buying a jersey (at the very least until he owned up and apologized)."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,greenshrubbery,-3,Fri Jun 5 22:54:32 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I dont think you can say for certain that he actually believes that. To me, it seems like he was just trying his hand at some observational humor and didn't realize how offensive it would be, its impossible to transmit facetiousness over the internet.  There's no denying it was in poor taste, but I always give people the benefit of the doubt in these situations. I dont think one bad joke should be indicative of your character. I say offensive stuff all the time but I dont stand behind my statements, its just fun to make people laugh. The only difference is a guy like Cardale is in the spotlight so hes gona be highly scrutinized for every move he makes.  Plus, you gota remember hes still just a kid playing football. He's not a seasoned politician or anything."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,CarlosSpcyWeiner,8,Fri Jun 5 23:23:48 2015 UTC,"Everyone makes mistakes, and I would definitely even be willing to think that this was a joke. The reason I posted this on this sub and the main reason I take issue with his actions is that he didn't have the courage to either admit he made a mistake or stand behind what he said and claim it was a joke. He instead backtracked when he realized people found it offensive and shifted all blame off of himself."
OopsDidntMeanTo,38pchd,mybaby51,2,Sat Jun 6 00:45:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah regardless of whether he meant it or not, his backtracking puts him squarely in this sub."

People need to learn to look within themselves, the world requires a lot of adaptation and compromise when you are in public.

OopsDidntMeanTo,359bmj,TheRealGentlefox,7,Tue Jun 2 21:14:56 2015 UTC,"eMule isn't a site, it's a file sharing program.   I can attest to the fact that in older file sharing programs, 90% of results were bunk, randomly generated porn names. You would search something like ""The Beatles"" and the majority of results were weird shit like ""tight teen fuck dog ass in double sexy"". I don't know if they were viruses, or links to websites or what, but even the ones that got a bit more accurate with the naming conventions would still be these 1-10 kilobyte files, which made it pretty obvious that they weren't actually video/mp3/pdf/whatever files. Nowadays we have well-run torrent indexing sites that can clear out the spam, let uploaders establish credit, etc. but programs like eMule, Limewire, and Kazaa were the wild west of piracy.  What he's claiming isn't completely clear to me, but I think he's saying he just went to the amateur porn category and downloaded all the most popular results, rather than downloading a single popular ""pack"" of porn. If that is indeed what he meant, I have no doubt that you would accidentally end up downloading a lot of weird stuff.

Your browser downloading an index page with that text on it is not enough, ""recents""  doesn't search within files.   Its also not a search of his whole computer.... Or his browser history... It's his actual recent files. Something that was watched, and then deleted, most likely to eliminate the evidence of his actions.

There just aren't any ways that a file can be downloaded, watched, deleted, and have a name that indicates it is clearly illegal. This one didn't have a string of dozens of names, just one name: two thirteen year olds fucked in the ass. The way it got there is by being searched for, downloaded, watched (to put it in recent activity), and then deleted.   Why does a subset of reddit go to bat for pedophiles so voraciously? They are fucking pedophiles, they don't deserve your assistance. This guy sought it out, downloaded it, watched it, deleted it.

What kind of lameass 'hacker' would even do this? It's quite possibly the worst trick in the history of the universe. 'Ah-ha! Blue's left his computer signed into reddit!

Why would you post a comment saying that you don't care about Taylor Swift's mom when you could go onto R4R and make an ad saying that you're trying to break the world record for most penises inside an anus in a one hour period and need as many replies as possible ASAP.

OopsDidntMeanTo,2xjdr7,duggtodeath,37,Sun Mar 1 18:38:06 2015 UTC,"She meant to send it to a friend to mean ""fuck my workplace"", but accidentally sent it to her workplace (boss and co-workers). She backpedals by saying she didn't mean the workplace but all of Earth."
OopsDidntMeanTo,2xjdr7,duggtodeath,20,Mon Mar 2 05:51:37 2015 UTC,"I get that, but isn't the point of this sub to catch people pretending to accidentally do something when they meant it all along. This example is kinda weak. For example, a stronger one would be her taking a cleavage pic and instead pretending it was to spot a pimple on her chest when no pimple is present."
OopsDidntMeanTo,2xjdr7,andrewpolidori,44,Mon Mar 2 12:41:37 2015 UTC,Poor excuses/backpedaling is also what this sub is about. It fits the MO of this sub perfectly.

OopsDidntMeanTo,2xjdr7,KokiriEmerald,17,Mon Mar 2 16:18:55 2015 UTC,"Person: Sorry, I did that by mistake/accident/hacked/satire/etc.  Everyone else: nah, it was obviously intentional.   If this applies to a submission, it is valid.   In this case, she says ""Oh my bad, I didn't mean my workplace, I meant Earth"", which is absurd. Outlandish backpedaling is the point.   I get your point, but the sub is still unique, and this way it casts a broader net."
OopsDidntMeanTo,2xjdr7,Throkil,-14,Tue Mar 3 05:56:26 2015 UTC,"Oh my bad, I didn't mean my workplace, I meant Earth   That's clearly a joke because she knows she'd fucked. She's not actually backpedaling."
OopsDidntMeanTo,2xjdr7,ScoobyDoos_Courage,11,Tue Mar 3 14:28:25 2015 UTC,It's clearly not a joke. She meant what she said. Then she got caught and tried to backpedal out of it.
