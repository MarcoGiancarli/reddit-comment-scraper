wisconsin,3e2krq,snarkypants,-8,Tue Jul 21 13:51:52 2015 UTC,"Update  Landlord helps ID mystery woman injured in bike crash    By Vivian Wang of the Journal Sentinel    A landlord has helped the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office identify a woman who was involved in an apparent bicycle crash Monday morning at Veterans Park.  The 64-year-old woman, whose name is not being released, was found unconscious on the path along the lakefront directly east of the sailing center. Her bicycle, which was discovered near her, showed damage consistent with some type of impact, said sheriff's office spokeswoman Fran McLaughlin. The bike frame was bent, and the front fork pushed inward so that the wheel could not move freely.  The landlord saw local news reports about the office's request for help identifying her, as she had been found without a phone, wallet, or any other kind of identification. She lives on the east side of Milwaukee, McLaughlin said.   She was transported to Froedtert Hospital for treatment, and her out-of-state relatives have been contacted. No other information on her medical status was available. | July 21, 2015 12:18 p.m."

Most GOP stances are so untenable to half the population that to publicly endorse them alienates a huge portion of voters. So he alludes to feeling a certain way about a distasteful topic so hardcore GOPers can say ""see he's with us on this topic!"" while moderate voters can say ""see he's not so bad, his stance is right down the middle"". All of his statements are carefully crafted to hit both demographics.

wisconsin,3dymkc,z3dster,45,Mon Jul 20 16:27:48 2015 UTC,"The GAB was created by 2007 Act 1, which was voted for as follows:  Senate Democrats: 18-0 Senate Republicans: 15-0 Assembly Republicans: 52-0 Assembly Democrats: 45-2"
wisconsin,3dymkc,toasters_are_great,22,Mon Jul 20 19:08:38 2015 UTC,"To piggyback on my own comment, Kevin Kennedy of the GAB has now issued a statement:   There has been a great deal of misinformation about the Government Accountability Board in the past two weeks, especially following Thursday’s Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling.  The G.A.B. has been a Wisconsin success story, and in many important ways has achieved what the Legislature intended by combining two separate agencies.  At the time, the Legislature determined that Wisconsin needed an independent watchdog to ensure that elections, ethics, campaign finance and lobbying laws are administered and enforced in a transparent nonpartisan manner.  Those goals remain central to our daily work at the G.A.B.  The G.A.B. has established itself as a model to be emulated throughout the country.  We have been nationally recognized as one of the top performing states in the administration of elections, lobbying and campaign finance laws.  We have been consistently commended by our local election partners and customers as indispensable to the effective and fair administration of those laws.  Policymakers and elected officials should be bragging about and taking credit for the structure and accomplishments of the G.A.B., and ensuring that it has the resources to continue its statutory responsibilities.  Unfortunately, it has become more expedient to use the G.A.B. as a political target than to honestly assess its performance.  In establishing the requirements for our Board and staff, the Legislature determined that this agency would be accountable not only to partisans, but to our many customers.  We receive strong, positive feedback every day regarding the assistance we provide to local clerks, candidates and political committees, public officials, and voters.  Almost all of that work is completely separate from the political dramas that make the headlines.   Even in the midst of controversies and events outside its control, the nonpartisan and professional G.A.B. has proven its value.  It has been thoughtful and thorough in responding to any concerns raised by the Legislature and others.  The G.A.B.’s efforts to implement recommendations resulting from the recent legislative audit were swift and complete.  And while the G.A.B. is often sued as the agency that enforces and administers election and campaign finance laws, typically any negative court decisions result from shortcomings in the laws that have been passed, not from decisions or actions of the G.A.B.  The Legislature expected and intended the Government Accountability Board to operate in a professional, unbiased, and nonpartisan manner.  In doing so, we have been accountable not to any single individual or political party, but to the will of the people of Wisconsin as expressed in its laws.  The Legislature and Governor are free to change those laws of course, but I am proud of what the agency has achieved since its inception.  It would be shortsighted to simply disregard that success."

wisconsin,3dymkc,environmentalent,2,Tue Jul 21 01:05:55 2015 UTC,I don't see it as an overstep at all. At best his comments violate the sub rules. At worst they are illegal. Let's keep that crap off of our sub.
wisconsin,3dymkc,Thonlo,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:59:50 2015 UTC,"Haha, what? Show me the rule he's violating; show me the law he's broken. Insults against other users can be moderated—which has also happened and I’m not contesting—though he'd actually have to make a credible threat of violence (rather than hoping for someone else to do it) before breaking a law. You’ll notice that the sub rules say to avoid overt hostility and intentionally antagonizing others. Looks to me that he only got moderated because you antagonized him to the point of profanity. Of his seven comments in this thread, it took until the last three for him to reach that point—over half were fine. What you're doing is a near equivalent to one toddler poking another and feigning innocence when an adult looks over, which is pretty much why that rule was written. If the rules were applied evenly, both of you should have had comments moderated.  Edit: 18 U.S.C. § 875 does not apply; I already addressed that a credible threat is more than just wishing someone dead. Relevant links here (threats) and here (criteria). Moderation applies between redditors, which I've seen explained by a moderator with justification given that they'd be working overtime to address political hostility by everyone. And given that we're talking about moderator abuse, an appeal to a representative authority is inane. Also, he never mentioned Walker's family; you straight up invented that—anyone is free to see this for themselves by looking through /u/mattbluesman's history. And finally, this argument isn't for some kind of personal victory, but so that others can weigh the merits of what's been said."
wisconsin,3dymkc,environmentalent,2,Tue Jul 21 11:20:21 2015 UTC,"Haha, what? Show me the rule he's violating; show me the law he's broken.   Ok. 18 U.S.C. § 875 and others. I think he is afforded some extra protections as a presidential candidate but IANAL.   You’ll notice that the sub rules say to avoid overt hostility and intentionally antagonizing others.   You don't think calling for the dismemberment of a government official qualifies as ""overt hostility""? That wishing the person and his family dies a fiery car wreck so the poster can ""laugh and laugh"" isn't ""overt hostility""? I sure do. Are you interpreting the sub rules so that only applies to hostility towards other Reddit users?   Looks to me that he only got moderated because you antagonized him to the point of profanity.   I disagree. Looks like the mods disagree.   What you're doing is a near equivalent to one toddler poking another and feigning innocence when an adult looks over, which is pretty much why that rule was written.   That's a terrible analogy. Regardless, I said ""shame on you"" and challenged him to back up his ridiculous claim and then, yeah, it went downhill from there.   If the rules were applied evenly, both of you should have had comments moderated.   Report my comments. Message the mods.

Labor supply/productivity and price elasticity do not work in the same way, especially if you're evoking St. Reagan who artificially boosted the labor demand which created more jobs by skyrocketing the DOD budget.

The Americans (in Grey) held a Fort in Prarie Du Chein with a small band of men and a gunship that disrupted trading from Canada (a British colony) and the Native tribes that traded with them further down the Mississippi and Wisconsin Rivers.  The British offered a choice of surrender to the Americans or a ""battle to the last man"" in the fort.  The Americans have a quick reply that they would not surrender, at which point the British gave the Americans at the fort time to evacuate their women and children to a nearby town.   The fighting commenced with a British ""3 pounder"" cannon that centered it's fire on the gunship as the military focused on the fort. The men shown in the pictures without uniforms represent a contingency of Native Americans fighting for the British, as their trade was being damaged by the presence of the American forces.     On the second day of fighting, the British cannon advanced to a spot that they were effectively able to fire on the ship and hit it several times, which made the commander of the ship retreat downstream, effectively dooming the fort without adequate supplies.   On the third day, British forces collected the American lead shot from the field, melted it down to red hot cannon balls, and fired it into the fort to start the fort on fire.   The American forces quickly surrendered as they were out of ammunition and low on food.   The total casualties were five wounded, which included an American that had his fingers cut off when (after the surrender) he tried to shake a Winnebago Indian's hand.  This is the only battlefield of The War of 1812 (or Revolutionary War) in Wisconsin.   Edit: picture of my daughter with a British soldier for scale.   :)"

I would actually like to know what reasons someone would have for supporting the guy.  I'm not looking for you to justify your position, at least not at this point.  You do have to admit that the man and his group have made a number of controversial decisions, and has said some rather polarizing things - in some cases even said some pretty hard-to-defend remarks.  As far as ""justifying"" those things, all I'd like to know is if someone I'm conversing with fully endorses such moves/statements, or of that supporter is figuratively holding their nose over these statements/actions, in the sense that other issues are of greater importance.  It's an honest question, and those tend to actually improve dialogue.  Several users of a conservative mindset have managed to articulate their positions in this subreddit and there has actually been productive dialogue - maybe you'd noticed?  But what you're doing, the drive-by ""I support Walker!"" and no follow-up, substance, or really anything is just like yelling out the window on a highway - you're just making noise to make noise.  That doesn't tend to sit well, no matter the community.  Also - the ""I shouldn't have to justify to you"" attitude?  It reads as belligerently defensive.  If you're good with that, that's cool.

wisconsin,3do18w,blueblob11,-2,Sun Jul 19 00:10:55 2015 UTC,"Watch close how liberals dance around the voting ID issue, ""It's racist I tell ya!""."
wisconsin,3do18w,cookster123,3,Sun Jul 19 00:20:27 2015 UTC,I don't rate voter ID a high priority issue. I do feel like people should be able to vote and voter id is just going to slow down voting. I also feel like the number of illegal immigrants voting is lower or equal to the number of old people that don't bother getting a new ID because they can't drive anyways. Probably about even in terms of split of votes.
wisconsin,3do18w,blueblob11,-3,Sun Jul 19 00:28:19 2015 UTC,Sure as hell opens the door to cheating by the democratic party though!
wisconsin,3do18w,cookster123,6,Sun Jul 19 00:56:04 2015 UTC,"You do realize that sentence doesn't really make sense? You should put forth a real argument to substantiate your opinion if you want to be taken seriously. Define cheating, is redistricting so that Republicans win when they have a minority of the vote cheating? That is literally what happened."
wisconsin,3do18w,blueblob11,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:30:34 2015 UTC,"Implying republicans wouldn't cheat as well. Both parties suck, get over it."
wisconsin,3do18w,Seasniffer,4,Sun Jul 19 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with voter ID. What's wrong is, like /u/blueblob11 said, messing with early voting and weekend voting and trying to implement new voter registration procedures a few weeks before a major election when an estimated 300,000 citizens wouldn't be able to vote.  I think we all should be able to get behind that regardless of political affiliation."
wisconsin,3do18w,Thonlo,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"100%, I just was being an ass to that guy because of how he was acting. AMERICANS should have every incentive to vote regardless of anything, but being able to show an ID is just common sense. You need it to do anything else to show who you are anyways."
wisconsin,3do18w,cookster123,4,Sun Jul 19 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is that voter ID inhibits AMERICANS from voting too. People that are 70+ may not have ID nor their birth certificates (which is required to get a new ID) despite being born in the US because they were not born at a hospital. You can read about the people for whom this is true on NPR. Young people also haven't gotten IDs yet (which isn't really a problem because they can get them). Voter ID should have taken that into consideration and grandfathered people over 70 into not requiring ID. Disallowing 11% of Americans an ability to vote (typically elderly, which have the highest overall turnout percentage) in an effort to combat people voting twice without evidence that there's a problem of people voting twice and illegal immigrants (for which the last count in votes I can find is 28.2% of the latino vote which constitutes 8.4% of the overall voting population for a total of ~2.4% of the overall vote). So we disallow 11% (some fraction of it because not all of those people would have necessarily voted, in WI about 60% vote, out of individuals 65+, about 70% vote, so conservatively take 60% of 11% for 6.6%) of Americans to vote because we're worried that 2.4% of the vote will be non-american.  Personally I am fine with voter ID as long as there's a significant effort to ensure that American's that don't have ID can get ID."

Hiking in great river bluffs state Park is worth doing as well. South of la Crosse, the valleys are very deep and winding, and look great in the fall.   Door County is very scenic too, with  the calm waters along Green Bay, you get beautiful sunsets, especially in the town of Egg Harbor or Ephraim. The east side is pretty as well, along Lake Michigan, especially at Cana Island. The shore is unspoiled , and the lighthouse provides incredible views.   Northern Wisconsin also has very nice, wooded lakes. Honestly, the state has natural beauty pretty much everywhere."

wisconsin,3dmqyn,nklotz,23,Fri Jul 17 15:08:47 2015 UTC,"Shopping at Kohl's could really be seen as a metaphor for the current tax code in America. There are a lot of weird rules that not everybody is aware of, but if you're willing to exploit them to your advantage (especially finding loopholes that allow you to use the rules in ways that really go against the spirit of the rule), you can save yourself some money. So I imagine that somebody like Scott Walker would love to shop at Kohl's.  As an example of some of the crazy dealings you can cheat with at Kohl's: they allow you to do ""even exchanges,"" meaning that if an item has a tag that says 30.00, you can trade it for any other item tagged 30.00. However, anybody who has ever shopped at Kohl's can tell you that things are never sold at their sticker price. But not all 30.00 items in the store are going to be marked down uniformly. You want that $30 Nike shirt that is only marked down to 25, and you see a $30 TekGear shirt that is marked down to 15? You could buy the TekGear shirt for 15 and then even exchange it for the Nike shirt. It makes no sense why they would allow this. Then you have all the complications of Kohl's cash, the 15/20/30%'s, and Kohl's coupons... I would hate to be a cashier there and have to deal with all the coupon queens of the world."
wisconsin,3dmqyn,KevinSorboFan,3,Fri Jul 17 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of the macro image of Trump's shit eating grin like the face of a person that would go through the hassle of eating half a cheeseburger before complaining about it, getting her money back to buy another one across town. All the while thinking they played the system, ignoring how much time they spent and gas/mileage used.  Kohl's probably doesn't care that you can take advantage of some of their policies - it still means you're coming to their store and buying other stuff and they're still making a profit.  I would be surprised if Walker isn't getting campaign contributions from Kohl's for telling this story everywhere."
wisconsin,3dmqyn,timbenj77,3,Fri Jul 17 17:02:42 2015 UTC,Kohl's is a WEDC benefiting company as well.
wisconsin,3dmqyn,LongUsername,2,Fri Jul 17 18:39:57 2015 UTC,"Why would they allow it? Because very few people bother, and the ones that do think they've received a better deal than someone else. How's that for a Walker parallel?   Why else might they allow it? Because the Nike brand carries a premium, so if they sell most at $30 instead of $15, they'll still make plenty of money.   I would presume that the 15/20/30 coupons are very specifically targetted at the recipient, such that infrequent shoppers receive more 30% coupons to draw them back to the store. Kohls cash exists for the same reason: bring 'em back.  There's also the aspect of using the Kohls credit card for your payments, and the $25 or $30 late fees when you forget to pay it."
wisconsin,3dmqyn,jfoust2,13,Fri Jul 17 21:09:04 2015 UTC,"Well done Jimmy. Not only is it odd that he keeps repeating this story but, why is shopping at Kohl's something to be proud of? Does anyone identify with Walker here?"
wisconsin,3dmqyn,madgreenguy,13,Fri Jul 17 15:16:26 2015 UTC,He's banking on the Everyday Man image. Kohl's is very relatable as well as having the wife couponing for you (at least from a TV sitcom perspective).
wisconsin,3dmqyn,KEM10,5,Fri Jul 17 16:24:50 2015 UTC,He's hoping that business will go up and they'll create the jobs they were supposed to with their WEDC funds so he doesn't look as bad.
wisconsin,3dmqyn,LongUsername,4,Fri Jul 17 18:41:19 2015 UTC,I assume it is the result of a campaign donation agreement with WCFG.
wisconsin,3dmqyn,PeanutTheGladiator,2,Fri Jul 17 15:48:54 2015 UTC,"Well, on Wednesday I did buy two polo shirts at Kohls that were priced at $50 & $40 respectively.  I had been meaning to get a couple new shirts and had a Kohls' Cash that was expiring that day.  (I'd have gone sooner but laziness won out the previous times.)  There was a One Day Sale so the first was marked down to $20 & the other was marked down to $15.  Then I had a coupon from a mailer that just so happened to arrive on Wednesday that gave me $15 off and the aforementioned $10 Kohls' Cash.  So, I ended up paying $10.53 after tax.    I never really saw it as getting huge deals.  I just see a store that clearly starts out with its prices WAY too high.    Also, have never voted for Walker."

Interesting note about his Harley: Walker was given his 2003 Road King by Tonette in 2008.  He's put on no more than 6,333 miles between then and a month ago, but claimed he'd added more than 20,000 miles to it in his book, ""Unintimidated"" that came out in November 2013.  Edit: looks like the 6,333 mile reading is from a rental, thanks to /u/maolighter for highlighting the possibility."

It's not exactly credible that a Harley enthusiast wouldn't have at least a vaguely accurate idea of their odometer reading, or that they wouldn't be closely examining the relevant section of a book that had been ghost written for them prior to going to press.  Edit: looks like it's an Iowa rental and so this conclusion is sound but invalid."

wisconsin,3dojey,HeavyLeadBelly,4,Sat Jul 18 04:05:01 2015 UTC,That's going a bit far: he may simply not be a Harley enthusiast and is merely using it as a prop to create a relatable yet false image of himself.

wisconsin,3dojey,maolighter,5,Sat Jul 18 05:23:29 2015 UTC,"A good point.  I've had a few moments today to look into this: Walker tweeted that image on June 6th at 7:41am.  Thirteen minutes later his personal aide tweeted this 4 second video, so it's all but certain it's the same machine.  This image is from 2008, so it's unclear whether it pre- or post-dates Walker's acquisition of a 2003 Road King that year and hence whether that's a shot of it or not.  The picture in your link is captioned as being from the 110th anniversary parade in 2013, so geographically and temporally it wouldn't make much sense to use anything but his own for that.  I've also found an image from 2009 in this article - again, the context of the caption strongly suggesting that this is his own - but it would seem to be inconsistent in the color of the headlamp housing.  I'm not entirely sure about that, it's quite possibly be silvered and reflecting the dark lower portion of the windshield.  In the video, though, the lower portion of the windshield is clear, plus the panniers and luggage rack are different.  A different speedometer seems to have been standard between the 1997 and 2009 models, and the current model does seem to have numbering of the same font as the instagram/tweet, consistent with it being rather newer than 2003.  So it does certainly look like it's not actually his own, and I've been faked out by his renting one state over."

Those policies “are outdated,” Mr. Walker said on Fox News, because the United States is “at war and radical Islamic terrorism is our enemy.”   Shouldn't he open up carrying a weapon to his political rallies in order to protect everyone? Wouldn't that automatically prevent an attack?"
wisconsin,3doiuy,Abzug,2,Sat Jul 18 11:30:39 2015 UTC,Nothing is guaranteed to automatically prevent anything.  The reason why the weapons are banned is because security watches for those for good reason.  Having them flung over people's shoulders just makes it a bigger security CF.

This won't sit well with the great many voters who regard the large amounts of money in today's politics as a corrupting influence rather than a free speech issue.

Every one knows that an articles tone and how they present facts and data can change how a story is perceived. An example a liberal story may say something like Scott walker slashes school aid by X amount o dollars. Where as a conservative author may take the same numbers and say Scott walker saves the state X amount of dollars. Same facts and figures 2 different stories. I rarely if ever see a story posted on this sub from a biased conservative site but a story that was already pposted from the js may get 2-4 more posts from places like the cap times and TPM. That was my point. Also.maybe if every non walker bashing comment wasn't downvoted to hell you would get the nuanced response that you and peanut seem to want. But what's the point.
wisconsin,3dqzw3,toasters_are_great,0,Mon Jul 20 15:48:58 2015 UTC,"An example a liberal story may say something like Scott walker slashes school aid by X amount o dollars. Where as a conservative author may take the same numbers and say Scott walker saves the state X amount of dollars.   Those aren't quite equivalent examples though: the former explains what specifically has been done (while implying the latter) while the latter does not (leaving it ambiguous as to whether it's due to consolidating largely similar government efforts, finding a way to receive some greater amount of available federal funding in place of state funding, forced lapses, overt cuts, or something else).  If there's nothing more than that then the liberal comment in your example conveys more information than the conservative one.  On the other hand, if those are headlines rather than short nibbles of information within, it would be an inconceivably short conservative piece if it were not to mention the source of the savings and so the context ought to be there in either case.   Every one knows that an articles tone and how they present facts and data can change how a story is perceived.   I think the best example of that in action might be the monthly jobs data, of which the two items most reported on are the unemployment rate and the private sector job total (and the changes to them).  Often they go in the same direction (in a good news/bad news way), but sometimes they'll embark on opposite headings and you get to see which one a news outlet emphasizes.   I rarely if ever see a story posted on this sub from a biased conservative site but a story that was already pposted from the js may get 2-4 more posts from places like the cap times and TPM.   ++ on your latter point at least.  While occasionally they become sufficiently different to warrant new posts on the sub as a story develops, by and large there's a goodly chunk of duplication going about that'd be more appropriate to the original's comments if put anywhere IMHO.  (On the monthly jobs data, the last time the unemployment rate and private sector jobs diverged on the good news/bad news front was with the March data.  The CT was actually the only local news outlet I could find which emphasized both of those, all the others emphasizing the unemployment rate drop and qualifying the job change as an unreliable figure with only the Biztimes hinting at - though not joining the dots regarding - the underlying reasons for the unemployment rate drop.  Also the CT gave some national context to both figures so I'm hard-pressed to credit your implication of the CT being liberally biased, at least when it comes to reporting on government numbers like these)."
wisconsin,3dqzw3,Thonlo,0,Mon Jul 20 20:47:51 2015 UTC,THAT is how you take issue with the data and the article and not the source.   Your response is disingenuous at best and uninformed at worst.    lol. No.

wisconsin,3di118,MSACCESS4EVA,23,Thu Jul 16 15:46:30 2015 UTC,"From the ruling, Justice Abrahamson in her dissent:   ¶378 Second, the Special Prosecutor filed a motion seeking the recusal of certain named justices. Three motions to file amicus briefs on the recusal issue have also been filed. Neither the named justices nor the court as a whole has responded to the Special Prosecutor's recusal motion. The recusal motion and the amicus motions remain pending, and the due process concerns they raise remain unresolved.   That recusal motion being:   ¶494 The Special Prosecutor's recusal motion cites Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868 (2009). In Caperton, the plaintiff moved to disqualify a justice of the Supreme Court of West Virginia on the grounds of bias resulting from campaign contributions and expenditures. The justice denied the plaintiff's motion, and the Supreme Court of West Virginia ruled against the plaintiff on the merits of the case. The United States Supreme Court reversed and remanded, ruling that due process required recusal under the circumstances presented.   So, faced with the need to argue against SCOTUS precedent, the majority simply punt.  The West Virginia one isn't a tangentially relevant case, because exactly the same thing happened in there: future plaintiffs threw millions at a State Supreme Court Justice's election then received a favorable judgement from them a few years later.  The parallels go deeper in Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Gableman's particular case, since some of the plaintiffs here even contributed almost exactly the same amount between them to unseat Justice Butler, as in West Virginia case where plaintiffs gave $3 million to Justice Benjamin's successful campaign to unseat incumbent Justice McGraw.  Given the amazingly close parallel then by SCOTUS precedent (and the court has not changed ideologically since then), the majority are incapable of being seen to have dispensed justice here.  Given that they had the recusal motion in their hands and threw it away without even bothering to say no, the only conclusion is that they just don't care."

Anyway, the constitutionality of the current law (stated by the majority opinion that part is ""overbroad and vague"") could be challenged, and when the lopsided senate and assembly meet this fall the bills they will propose to stop any future investigation like this could also be challenged. I have no problem going after this kind of power grab.  So much of current politics is ""did my side win?"" when it shouldn't be about sides. Are our representatives representing us? With vague finance laws, backdoor deals and attempts to rewrite the law in their favor, why should anyone be okay with our elected leaders having endless political ammo? The simplest breakdown of this situation is doing something that should be illegal if the law weren't so vague, then paying the judges to rule in your favor, then (coming this fall) rewriting the laws so you can't be investigated like this again.

This ruling was bought and paid-for by WCFG and the outcome was preordained from the moment those justices didn't recuse themselves as would have been appropriate.   It's pretty clear the main objection was intimidation and not objective investigation.    That isn't clear at all. Quite the opposite.

wisconsin,3djhkq,Thonlo,4,Thu Jul 16 19:43:34 2015 UTC,"Addendum to follow:    Indirect Impacts to Dane County Government but Impacting the Community   University of Wisconsin System:  Reduces state support for the system by $300 million over the biennium and changes the organizational structure from a state agency to a semi-autonomous public authority structure.   Impact:  A great deal of attention has been given to this topic.  The impacts might include reduced employment in the system, higher tuition, reduced enrollment or course offerings, etc.  Lay-offs would impact our local economy. Joint Finance:  Decreased cut to $250 million  UW Extension:  Expects a $5.2 million cut and 10% loss of positions.  Areas of concern include layoffs of UW Extension agents who cover agriculture, 4-H youth development, family living programs and cuts to local county extension offices.  Impact:  The full impact of this cut to our local Dane County Extension Office will  start in 2017.   Mental Health:  Mingle Community Mental Health Program funds with Community Aids.  Require counties to provide community-based crisis assessment for emergency detentions by a mental health professional.  Provides $1.5 million in 2016 to cover costs.  Move the Office of Children’s Mental Health to DHS.   Impact:  Dane County already funds Journey Mental Health Center to provide community based crisis assessments for Emergency Detentions.  Joint Finance:  Deleted moving the Children’s Office to DHS office   New Time Limits:  Reduce the lifetime limits for W-2 participation and Medicaid coverage for childless adults from 60 months to 48 months.   Impact:  Fewer Dane County residents will be eligible for health services and W-2 which provides income, child care and job training support.    Juvenile Care:  Transfer juvenile aftercare programs from DOC to Dept. of Children & Families.   Impact:  Impact unknown at this point.  If the aftercare programs continue at DCF, there will be no impact on Dane County.  If the aftercare programs are eliminated, Dane County will need to take responsibility for aftercare of our Juveniles.  Dane County currently purchases aftercare from the State DOC.   Fostering Futures Connections Count Program:  Fund Community Connectors to interact with vulnerable families with children up to age 5 and direct them to community support services.   Impact:  Provide $360,300 in 2016-2017.  This funding might be a new source of revenue to support Dane County early childhood initiatives.   Drug Testing & Treatment:  Require drug testing for unemployment insurance, food  share, and Medicaid for childless adults.   Impact:  For Food Share and Medicaid, over 10,000 Dane County adults could be affected in Dane County with a cost to the state of $750,000 to conduct the tests.  The impact on those filing for unemployment would drive this cost higher and impact a larger population.  Joint Finance Action:  Change so budget bill provisions reflect AB 191 (FSET Drug Testing).  Governor:  Partial veto to allow treatment costs to be paid for by private insurance.  Vetoed “suspicion” as a basis for requiring a test.    Out of Home Care:  Transfer funding to DCF & continue support program for young adults 18 to 21 who are enrolled in school and have an IEP.  Provide $1 million in 2016 and $1.2 million in 2017.   Impact:  No fiscal impact.  This could be a program improvement.   Bike & Pedestrian Facilities:  Eliminates requirement for new highway projects.  Loss of $7.4 million. Joint Finance Action:  Repeal statute requiring bike & pedestrian facilities with highway projects.  Replace with WIDOT giving consideration to facilities in new highway construction/reconstruction funded by state and federal funds and need approval by local government.   Governor:  Partial veto removes local government approval.   DNR Board:  Removes the Natural Resources Board’s rulemaking authority and makes it advisory only.    Joint Finance Action:  Delete Change.   Senior Care:  Reduces funding for Senior Care prescription drug benefit.  Requires all participants to enroll in Medicare part D as the primary insurance payer. Joint Finance Action:  Delete changes. Domestic Violence Grants:  Increases grants to domestic abuse service providers by $5 million in the second year of the budget. Community Reintegration Services:  Changes statutes to allow the Dept. of Corrections to contract for community reintegration services for inmates discharged from prison.  These services are currently provided by Madison Urban Ministries and Project Return in Madison.  Each currently receives $50,000 per year."

wisconsin,3dftgx,layer555,12,Thu Jul 16 05:06:07 2015 UTC,"It is unfortunately becoming very common (I would say more often than not, but I'm honestly making that up) where the state/local government subsidizes a stadium for a major sports team.  The idea is that it brings in tax dollars for the area: sales taxes, not just for the events on the stadium but for everything that surrounds it, like that dinner or trip to the bar you made before and after the game, as well as taxes on the wages/salaries of those working, from players to stadium management to the guy who cleans up your seat afterwards.  If Milwaukee/Wisconsin won't put up big bucks for a new stadium, the Bucks are more likely to start shopping around for a new home, probably one where the city would be happy to buy a stadium (or at least, a major portion of the costs).  If done properly, this could be a good situation for the government and the team.  A multipurpose stadium could be built, owned by the government but rented to whoever wants to use it - sports teams, conventions, etc.  But sadly, that's not how it usually goes.    From what I have read about this, the tax dollars brought in and the money spent on the stadium ends up being a wash.  I'm no fan of Walker, but if I had to make the choice to have the Bucks in Milwaukee or not, and the financial effect was overall neutral, I'd probably vote on a new stadium as well."

wisconsin,3dftgx,Niehaus,3,Thu Jul 16 19:17:59 2015 UTC,"/u/spongebue has a great summation there.  Basically, it's not that the Bucks owners can't afford a new stadium. They certainly could. But they have leverage because they could pick up the team and move to Seattle and still be successful. So they hang it over the local/state economy's head and say ""we're moving unless you pay for part of our stadium.""  It's not exactly fair. You'd think the private owners would just privately fund it. But seeing as it's a competitive market and other cities have or would build a stadium to house the team too, it becomes more complicated.  So the bottom line is that if you want the economy stimulation from sporting events, in today's world, there's a good chance the local/state government are going to need to be proactive in getting teams here and keeping them."
wisconsin,3dftgx,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:03:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure it's as easy as picking up the team and moving to Seattle. The Bucks are a franchise entrenched in Milwaukee's history and they have a large fan base here. Making the move to a new city is never an easy thing to do, so I'd say that staying in Milwaukee is the easier route. Both the state and the owners would prefer staying in Milwaukee, so it's mutually beneficial for them to strike a deal before the league forces a move."
wisconsin,3dftgx,King_of_Shade,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:22:23 2015 UTC,Right.  But it doesn't change the fact that they could afford a new stadium. They just don't feel that they should have to. Because a stadium would be mutually beneficial.

The schedule is officially posted on Thursday at 530pm for the following Sunday through Saturday, but often isn't actually posted until Friday morning or afternoon.  In the 3 years at my current employer, I've had my schedule arbitrarily changed even after this in the computer without notification three times, and received angry calls from managers when I didn't show up.  Lucky for me they never updated the posted schedule so my ass was covered (plus the printed schedules are time stamped so they're hard to fake).  Otherwise I would have immediately been on a final warning for a year.  Plus they will not allow employees to get their schedule over the phone.  There is no way to access it online.  You have to physically come to the store to get it.  If you're on vacation, tough shit, when you get back, you'd better stop in before you come back to work.  Even if you live an hour away or take public transportation.  I lucked out and was granted full-time status within a few months of hire, but they have a company wide freeze on hiring full-time employees for the last two years.  Part timers don't earn paid time off at all, get zero benefits, and often work such ridiculously short shifts that they can work 7 days a week and still earn less than 40 hours.  Turnover is ridiculous, our sales floor and cashier coverage is abysmal, and the core team is burning out hardcore because we're saddled with all the operational shit and customer service shit at the same time.

Will there be some? Absolutely, no doubt. But on a larger scale I see more people getting a chance to push to 40 hours of work at one job instead of 20 and 20 at two and they are already working 7-8-9 days in a row. I know plenty of them already. I see them everyday and deal with their weird work schedules.  This is retail and manufacturing specific changes, correct? I think employers are going to watch the time clocks enough because many I know don't want to pay overtime and skate the laws of it already while their employees play along, stupidly.  There is a lot of talk of ""the day of rest"". But I can't see good companies pushing people past the 40 hour work mark, some may go 50 but man the taxes eat you alive and it isn't worth it. You can hire more people and keep everyone at 40.  Sorry to ramble on. As I said in my original post.. ""I'm not saying this change is great or terrible right now.""

The whole ""people will get the chance to work more"" is really horsecrap, since they could always do it on a voluntary basis to begin with.  It's a narrative pushed by business proponents to try and spin this as a positive for employees. The people you see with weird work schedules don't have them because of that regulation.  The insidious thing about changes like this is the slow speed of the change.  Slowly, employers start to force people to work more consecutive days. It won't be Wal-Mart, but it will be Menards.  It will happen slowly and employees will be told the same old mantra:    Be happy you have a job."

My guess is that the majority of Bucks fans are in the Milwaukee area.  Why tax the rest of the state to pay for the Buck's new stadium?  So the current Bucks stadium is 27 years old and they say they need a new one.  If the same thing happens with the Brewers, they'll ask for a new stadium in 2027, at which point we'll go through another round of threats to move and government handouts."

He also is Scott Walkers campaign manager, and he is also on the board of the Charter School Growth Fund.  Now Michael Grebe is also on the board of the Bradley Center, (i wouldnt be surprised if he had Bucks ownership as well)  and he also is president of the Bradley Foundation, which is involved in charter schools as well.  With the exception of banning microbeads, Walkers legislation changes basically only benfitted a few select number of people, it made small adjustments that ultimately allow a very small sliver of people to make huge profits, and does so  by taking tax payer money.  I honestly can't think of a singlle thing Walker did that makes me proud to have him as our governor.

I'd think the FCC would grant an exception for this since that station covered way more than just the Wausau area... now Rhinelander and other areas are high and dry.

wisconsin,3d93ii,WISubmittyman,4,Tue Jul 14 13:38:53 2015 UTC,Wasn't California's law dealing with having to be vaccinated as a requirement to attend public school? This article seems a little misleading if that's the case. It doesn't mention that part at all. Or are we actually proposing mandatory vaccines when medically possible?  Edit - medically
wisconsin,3d93ii,FatBox360,8,Tue Jul 14 18:19:35 2015 UTC,I would much rather it cover everyone equally. Breaking herd immunity because of irrational fear is stupid and irresponsible.
wisconsin,3d93ii,mullirific,8,Tue Jul 14 19:44:17 2015 UTC,"I think that everyone that can be vaccinated should be vaccinated, but by choice.  I dream of an informed society that would want vaccinations and we needn't worry about legislating it.  Mandatory vaccines just kinda rub me the wrong way, though.  I think requiring it in order to take advantage of public services, like schools, seems much more likely to stand-up to legal challenges than requiring it of all citizens, full stop.  I suppose the real issue is children of anti-vaccers not having a say in this and the rest of us wanting to protect them, ourselves, and our children from their idiot parents."
wisconsin,3d93ii,FatBox360,2,Tue Jul 14 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"I'm all for full and free choice, until it hurts other people. Breaking herd immunity because of a ""choice"" you made directly threatens and can kill others that weren't fortunate enough to be able to receive a vaccine due to allergies or suppressed immune systems. Since we don't have an informed society (clearly) the only option is to mandate it through the government...after all that's why government exists, otherwise collective group actions would never work."
wisconsin,3d93ii,mullirific,2,Tue Jul 14 21:10:09 2015 UTC,"An interesting wrinkle that could develop is if someone were to press charges or sue for murder/harm if someone's unimmunized kid gets a baby sick that is too young for the full set of shots. That would cut this down very quickly, imho.  Something to remember in these discussions is it isn't always immunosuppressive patients that can be harmed, but newborns as well."

wisconsin,3d93ii,Abzug,2,Tue Jul 14 22:27:49 2015 UTC,"One, the other guy is right. It'd be unbelievably difficult to demonstrate someone was directly responsible. Even if you were able to fingerprint the specific strain, you couldn't demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt the absolute route of transmission. Sure, maybe the anti-vaxxer is the most likely candidate, but who's to say both the sick person and the anti-vaxxer didn't contract it from the same source, maybe someone who stopped to asked for directions briefly and coughed on their sleeve?   Second, even assuming you could establish a direct history of transmission, no way it'd be considered murder. At best it'd be manslaughter, but more likely it'd be some form of reckless endangerment charge. Murder implies intent (either premeditated or as a crime of passion), whereas I doubt you'd be able to prove someone didn't get vaccinated specifically so they could infect others."

I m not a lawyer, but I thought a john doe investigation, is just supposed to be an investigation to determine if a crime took place, if there is reasonabe evidence that a crime took place, then I think the john doe investigation needs to cease, and a regular public trial needs to take place.  I dont think a john doe investigation is supposed to further proceed into a john doe trial, and thats why I think there was some issues?  I still dont fully understand what this was all about, it seemed like there was a PAC, and somebody involved in the PAC moved the money into other organizations that weren't necessarily in alignment with the mission of the original PAC, and were also organizations the director of the PAC was personally involved in.  This money grab was more about lining the pocket of the person running the original PAC.

He very clearly used a divide and conquer strategy by leveraging existing tension between Milwaukee and Madison (particularly Madison) and the rest of the state, and stated that high speed rail didn't benefit Wisconsin, despite the large amount of federal funding that supported its development and the bringing of Talgo into the state to manufacture train cars.  The recall election focused on ""sour grapes"".  They stated that he won fair and square the first time, and the recall election was simply ""sour grapes"" and nothing else.  It greatly simplified the actual issues, but was a very clear and powerful marking message.  Democratic challengers do have to take some of the blame.  Wisconsin didn't do a good job of putting the best candidates forward to oppose him.  I tended to vote against Walker more than voting for his opponent.  I did think that Arthur Kohl-Riggs was an interesting challenger, but he was absolutely crushed in the recall election primary, since he ran as a republican against Scott Walker, so he only got 3 percent of the vote.  Here's Arthur Kohl-Riggs's Reddit AMA:  https://www.reddit.com/comments/smphr/my_name_is_arthur_kohlriggs_i_am_23_years_old_i/  Walker has used an interesting strategy of creating more controversy than most Wisconsin voters are willing to pay attention to at the same time.  Many citizens choose to tune all (or most) of it out, which benefits Walker greatly."

wisconsin,3d6zxh,obrysii,2,Tue Jul 14 11:22:33 2015 UTC,"Originally in the 2010 election he appealed to me as a candidate that a young conservative could get excited about because of his conservative campaign platform.  This was the first election I was old enough to vote in, actually.   I was going to Madison in 2010 and was there when he won,  and implemented the collective bargaining legislation. I was there for all of the ensuing drama. Personally, I supported that move as I believe that collective bargaining for public employees represents a conflict of interest (I'm a federal employee btw and we are not nor do I believe we should be unionized).  In my year at Madison,  I was even more turned off from Wisconsin Democrats based on all the stunts they pulled (fleeing the state because they knew they didn't have the votes to stop the legislation,  then politicizing the Supreme Court election,  etc).  So I fully supported him again in the recall election.  In 2014 my support was a bit more lukewarm but I still voted for him over Burke who seemed like an awful candidate. There's something to be said for a candidate who,  after promising to enact conservative reforms,  actually does so.  There are a few major points where I disagree with him,  one being his little rant against gay marriage after the SCOTUS decision. I knew was against it but I was hoping he wouldn't continue to make it a campaign issue since it's an issue I don't agree with him on.  But overall, do I regret voting for him? No, if I could go back and change those votes I would still vote for him even though I would change a couple others (like Feingold instead of Johnson)."

It's clear from both that Walker is not particularly popular right now (although I'd always take St Norbert's with a pinch of salt because it's not restricted to either likely or registered voters and the methodology is pretty opaque).  The basis of attributing this to the education cuts in the latest budget is the more detailed questions in the Marquette poll.  It's a small stretch from that to claiming it's caused Walker's recent drop in popularity, because Walker has made many different not-so-popular decisions this year so it's rather tricky to parcel out the drop amongst the various possible reasons for it."

Compared to writing a blank check to UW so the professors can teach for 3 hours a week and sit in their multi million dollar estates over looking Lake Monona?   I don’t understand how all Walker supporters buy into this narrative that  teachers/professors in the state are these filthy rich leaches of society. I highly doubt there are many if any professors at UW with multi million dollar estates. are some paid well? sure they are, doesn’t mean you need to be jealous just because you have to put in 50 plus hours a week just to get by. any professor with a multi million dollar estate isn’t teaching 3 hours a week. they’re likely highly skilled specialists that devote the majority of their life studying and teaching their field.  but hey, lets talk more on the subject of writing blank checks. Like the WEDC, you know, Walkers flagship state jobs agency that’s been writing out millions in state taxpayer dollars for loans to campaign contributors like William Minahan and Ron Van Den Heuvel. William Minahan lied on loan applications and failed to pay his state taxes the year before Scott's WEDC decided he was a good applicant for a 500,000 loan. and how about Ron Van Den Heuvel who had red flags everywhere before being granted his 1.2 million dollar loan from the WEDC. he used his loan to pay for leases on luxury vehicles like a Maserati and even a personal Cessna airplane. that’s right, your tax dollars went to a millionaire Scott Walker donor so he could pay his leases on luxury vehicles and a personal aircraft. these are loans that will never be paid back. if that isn’t bad enough journalists are just scratching the surface on cases like these. there are many more just like this where the state will be out on hundreds of millions of dollars in loans that will never be paid back. which is why Scott Walker wanted to slash WI's open records laws so he could continue to keep these shady dealings in the dark and prevent tax paying citizens from knowing where their tax dollars are actually going.    Crushing the middle class? You act like teachers and state workers are the only people in the middle class. He didn't raise property taxes or income taxes. That sure sounds good to me. You act like Wisconsin liberals are so holy. Mary Burke would of ran this state into the ground.    oh sure he didn’t raise taxes, but he hasn’t had a hard time wasting state tax dollars with his WEDC business loans. and with wasted tax dollars and no revenue from new taxes or increases, quality of life goes down. who would have thought that quality of life goes down when taxes go down? the state park system once rated the best in country has become neglected, deer carcasses line the freeways because the tax dollars that use to pay the state workers who removed them are gone, and how about all the police officers and fire fighters that haven't had a raise in several years so you can save 30 bucks a year on property taxes. taxes pay for the betterment of all around us and provide us a comfortable civilized life. people like you who complain about taxes, are the truly greedy, self centered schmucks with an over blown sense of entitlement.   Let's talk about how none of the Democrats besides the ones from Milwaukee are going to vote for the Milwaukee Arena. Think of all those great union construction jobs that it will create. Think of all the inner city minorities in Milwaukee who would get good paying jobs.    you know this is just as much of a political trap as the funding for the Bradly Center scoreboard was.    Yeah, crushing the middle class.   gutting the rights of union workers is just the first step. once the unions are crushed and have no voice for workers rights they will move in and pillage workers rights in the private sector as well. and you can already see this happening as evidenced by slipping into the budget the 7 day work week polices. you like working 10 plus hour days? well just wait until your employer tells you you have to work 7 of them straight or they'll give your job to a younger guy in line for it.  Wisconsin is headed down a very dark path. you should really take a look into Walker’s polices and read about them to see what the Governor is actually doing to this state. or you can just keep masturbating to Megyn Kelly and blindly voting for a puppet held on strings by out of state billionaires."

wisconsin,3d6zxh,Niehaus,23,Tue Jul 14 02:54:32 2015 UTC,"Shit for alternatives. When people dislike both of their presented choices, they will either turn out for the one they think sucks the least or not turn out at all. All it takes is a sliver of people not turning out one one side and a sliver of people turning out on the other to win an election. Walker does have a poor approval rating. More than half of the state does dislike him. The question isn't what his approval rating is, it's does more than half of the state's voter turnout like him less than the alternative on polling day.  Not that it matters, anyway. The important election, ever since the gerrymandering business from 2010, has been 2018. By taking the governor's office then, the Democrats can force a redrawing of the district lines in a more fair way, meaning they can stand a chance at winning back the legislature. Getting Burke in for 4 years would have meant a legislature passing bills that wouldn't get signed, a change in the way government departments run, two makeshift budgets, and an easier Republican victory in 2018 when they say ""look how little Burke is doing"" and people buy it because, as is evidenced by nearly every topic on /r/Wisconsin, people blame the Governor for laws that, in the end, originated in the Assembly or Senate."

Voter ID was more so a nationwide effort to suppress votes that lean Democrat because their base is dying off.  As well, ever since Schultz and Ellis left, practically the entire party has acted as just one unit to consolidate power.  Walker, being the figurehead of it, gets the brunt of flack for it.  The thing about being Governor, though, is that when a poorly written bill piece of shit comes upon your desk, you're supposed to veto it.

Of the current crop, probably. If the Democrats are smart (which the last 5 years have shown they are anything but) they would bring up someone new. The Sanders-Hillary showdown is probably going to fracture the party. If one of them wins the presidency, it'll likely dictate the party's nation-wide direction for the next round of elections. If Hillary wins, I'd imagine Vinehout or LaFollette would have an easy pass in. If Sanders somehow pulls it off, though, we could well see someone with similar views becoming the candidate. Keep your eyes peeled during Walker's campaign. If I were the Democratic party, I'd roll out whoever I'm going to run with during his campaign. Get a contradictory, local voice in the news. Set up the fight early and let the other Republican candidates help you tear into every policy Walker has signed. Do that and 2018 is a cakewalk.   Some Most of those all laws did not originate from the Assembly or Senate since they were written by proxy interests.   Fixed. Without going into detail, I've been in closed-door political decision-rooms before. This is one of those things that pretty much every politician does regardless of affiliation, and for good reason. Plenty of our legislators have jobs back at home. Most have families, community commitments, and re-election to concern themselves with. You aren't usually going to find a legislator who actually has the time and knowledge necessary to write all of their own bills from the beginning. They'll typically take sample legislation from a special interest who they agree with, edit out parts they dislike, insert parts they like, and then present it. In many cases, that's a good thing. Legislators are writing laws that affect everything in the state. Health, transportation, university research funding, k-12 education, poverty, etc. How many senators who are also actively practicing medical doctors who also have Masters degrees in civil engineering and who moonlight as fourth grade teachers in poverty stricken areas while working on their new jet propulsion research do you know? Letting the industry have a hand in writing the laws is a good thing, because they understand stuff that you couldn't possibly hope to. The key is understanding that they want something out of the law, identifying what that something is, and then acting to stop it if it's bad or pushing for it if it's good.  Agreed on the rest of it. Walker's not about to veto things he agrees with. His signature is the final one on the documents and it makes him share responsibility, but that bill would have never reached his desk if a majority of the Senate and Assembly didn't also agree to its contents."

Walker won election THREE times. Not once, not twice but three. There is clearly something that he says/does/acts that resonates with Wisconsin voters.

And you're right, i responded more to your second statement.    Or not and continue to spout nonsense like that   Now why is what I said nonsense?   1), if Walker ""bought"" the election, Obama bought at least his first election in 2008. 2008- McCain spent $333 million compared to Obama's $730 million source. 2014- Walker spent $37.6 million compared to Baldwins $14.2 source  2) If the dems did not have a strong candidate, that does not take away from Walker still winning the election. Just like Obama winning doens't mean he won because because the republicans had weak candidates run (Mcain and Rommeny). Both Obama and Walker won because they were the stronger candidates.    Any of the arguments used against Walker winning, can be used against Obama. But when the opponent wins why do we have to try and reduce what they accomplished? They won, and elections have consequences. If the republicans don't put up a good presidential nominee, they will have to deal with a democrat president.    see you went with my latter suggestion. Absolutely nothing you wrote here applies to what I said.   So change my mind. How is this all nonsense?"

Las Vegas is already building a stadium that is 100% tax payer funded to entice a team to go there. It wouldn't be a problem if there were just more teams.   By the way, stadiums are actually good.

It's not the same thing and you know it. The Bucks will NEVER be the Packers. Never. No team in any sport is.  Also, I would argue that the Fox River Valley economy is built around manufacturing and heavy industry, not the Packers."
wisconsin,3d3x2i,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:01:57 2015 UTC,"You're correct about the Packers being a very special situation.   The Packers are the only community-owned franchise in American major league professional sports.[26] Rather than being the property of an individual, partnership, or corporate entity, they are held in 2014 by 360,584 stockholders. No one is allowed to hold more than 200,000 shares,[3] approximately 4% of the 5,011,557 shares[27] currently outstanding. It is this broad-based community support and non-profit structure[28] which has kept the team in Green Bay for nearly a century in spite of being the smallest market in all of North American professional sports.  Based on the original ""Articles of Incorporation for the Green Bay Football Corporation"" enacted in 1923, should the franchise to have been sold any post-expenses money would have gone to the Sullivan-Wallen Post of the American Legion to build ""a proper soldier's memorial."" This stipulation was included to ensure there could never be any financial inducement for shareholders to move the club from Green Bay. At the November 1997 annual meeting, shareholders voted to change the beneficiary from the Sullivan-Wallen Post to the Green Bay Packers Foundation, which makes donations to many charities and institutions throughout Wisconsin.[27]  Even though it is referred to as ""common stock"" in corporate offering documents, a share of Packers stock does not share the same rights traditionally associated with common or preferred stock. It does not include an equity interest, does not pay dividends, can not be traded, has no securities-law protection, and brings no season ticket purchase privileges. All shareholders receive are voting rights, an invitation to the corporation's annual meeting, and an opportunity to purchase exclusive shareholder-only merchandise.[28] Shares of stock cannot be resold, except back to the team for a fraction of the original price. While new shares can be given as gifts, transfers are technically allowed only between immediate family members once ownership has been established.[27]  Green Bay is the only team with this form of ownership structure in the NFL, which is in direct violation of current league rules stipulating a maximum of 32 owners per team, with one holding a minimum 30% stake. The Packers' corporation was grandfathered when the NFL's current ownership policy was established in the 1980s.[31] As a publicly held nonprofit, the Packers are also the only American major-league sports franchise to release its financial balance sheet every year.   The Packers can't pull the ""build us a new stadium or we will leave"".  The NFL, NBA, and NHL first and foremost goal is profit.  I think they should change to let other teams be like the Packers in regards to ownership but it's highly unlikely due to greed.  The NFL actively covered up football related brain injuries, ffs.   The National Football League has spent the last two decades engaging in a extensive cover-up campaign of potential links between its sport and long-term brain injuries, waging war against scientists and researchers who go against it, denying the science those researchers have produced, and misleading players about the effects the game may have on their long-term mental health. That’s the focus of League of Denial, the much-awaited PBS Frontline documentary that stays true to its name in painting a searing, two-hour-long picture of the NFL as Big Tobacco: an industry so hell-bent on making money and preserving its product that it would go to nearly any length to prevent research that shows it may be killing its practitioners from seeing the light of day."

There aren't as many entertainment options as those cities have so having an NBA team is a real boom,  especially as the NBA continues to grow rapidly in value. Secondly, Milwaukee actually will lose revenue if the Bucks leave,  notwithstanding any economic effect the team has on the surrounding area,  plus if we keep the Bradley center it will cost a lot to repair and we'll be repairing a dump of a stadium that doesn't even have a team."
wisconsin,3d3x2i,UncharminglyWitty,-8,Wed Jul 15 00:35:30 2015 UTC,No. It's been shown time and time again that stadiums bring revenues to surrounding business. The flops are actually the anomalies. Even the report that Oliver quoted is that it is just less good than other reports find. But it is still a net positive for a community/city.   I like Oliver but he actually used 0 data in this one and instead used 2 anecdotes. The Marlins were a fucking disaster and honestly that's a result of the city making handshake agreements rather than getting shit in a written contract.

If we let the bucks leave, we have an empty arena that we need to pay to maintain, plus we lose all that tax revenue from the players.  Let us not forget that the team is picking up any cost overruns too, unlike what happened with Miller Park.    A new arena will also attract bigger profile events, like the NCAA Tournament's deeper rounds.  I think it'd be pretty fucking cool to have the final 4 here someday."
wisconsin,3d3x2i,no_soul_ginger,5,Mon Jul 13 16:41:38 2015 UTC,"1) We will already pay for the space, arena or not.  Empty arena would be torn down for some other development project, undoubtedly under another TIF arrangement to ""spur downtown development"".  Yet another carrot, for yet another wealthy finance group.  If Milwaukee is so fucking desirable, why do we have to shell out hundreds of millions of dollars for second-rate ""investment""?  2) If the team ownership can afford to pick up cost overruns, they should be paying for the arena.  3) Are any of those events you're talking about possibly happening under a contract?  No?  Then it's only hypothetical.  Should the taxpayers be out several hundred millions of dollars because ""it'd be cool"" to have a NCAA game played here?  4) Look at MLS.  Chicago Fire ownership is a lot like the Bucks ownership.  Not wanting to really spend a lot to keep a team going, the team has the support of the fans, despite a crap record, and the Toyota Park stadium has proved to be an utter debacle for Bridgeview and the Fire."
wisconsin,3d3x2i,adamb10,4,Mon Jul 13 17:55:14 2015 UTC,"1.)  Like it or not, sport teams make an area more desirable and well known.  99% of the country would never have heard of Green Bay if the Packers did not play there.  Pro sport teams add credibility to an area.  2.)  The owners are paying for half the cost + overruns.  This is not typical of public financing deals, where the public is responsible for over half the costs (Miller Park.  Cost: $400 million, taxpayers: $290 million).  This is a pretty good deal.  3.)  It's all purely speculative but high profile events won't want to play in an aging arena.  They'll skip Milwaukee and play in Chicago just to the south more than they do today.    4.)  You're comparing a 2nd tier league (Major League Soccer) to the 2nd/3rd most popular sport in America. What?  The Bucks will generate more revenue for the area than a MLS team."

But it's a good deal!  You know what would make Milwaukee more attractive?  A couple hundred million dollars in school investments, after school programs, and community policing.  3) So?  What does one Final 4 event bring in?  Show some dollars.  4) LOL.  Educate yourself.  More people going to MLS games than NBA.  Not to mention, NBA has a talent monopoly, while MLS has to compete for players against worldwide leagues that are far older than MLS' 19 years in existence.

Actually I don't, unless my TV broke and I was in the market for one anyway.  In Milwaukee's case, we're going to be out of an NBA team so we are in the market for a new arena anyway.    3.)  The final four held in Arlington Texas a few years ago was expected to bring in 276 million dollars.  Admittedly I also found an article saying Indy is projected to lose  income on it.    4.)  Sure, MLS has slightly higher attendance than the NBA, but the revenue is higher for the NBA as a result of player salaries, ticket prices, and TV cable ratings.

While I don't doubt basketball growing in popularity overseas, it has a much longer way to go to reach soccer's levels worldwide.  In the US?  Soccer's gaining.

wisconsin,3d3x2i,karlshea,4,Mon Jul 13 15:10:49 2015 UTC,"You're only half right: The league can buy back the team from the new owners if construction doesn't start in 2015.  However, the current owners have also been using that as a threat to get taxpayers to finance the stadium. They could get private financing and build it themselves and the league wouldn't buy it back."
wisconsin,3d3x2i,toasters_are_great,2,Mon Jul 13 16:40:06 2015 UTC,"The league can buy back the team from the new owners if construction doesn't start in 2015.   I've certainly seen this claim many times before, but I've never seen the Bucks or the NBA actually produce such a contract and ESPN in that link only uses anonymous sources.  It's plausible that there would be one on account of the fact that the NBA has an interest in keeping a reputation for being a top-flight sport with their teams playing in shiny new facilities.  Assuming it's true, then, current owners Edens and Lasry are contractually obligated to see a new stadium built for the Bucks, but as we know (from Kohl's unchallenged statements about his sale to them), they are also contractually obligated to keep the Bucks in Milwaukee.  The two signed on both those dotted lines before there was a penny of public money proposed, so if state and local government doesn't lift a finger they have to build a new stadium in Milwaukee anyway.  So why lift a finger if it'll happen with or without public money anyway?"
wisconsin,3d3x2i,karlshea,2,Tue Jul 14 01:24:36 2015 UTC,My guess is that they are contractually obligated to keep the Bucks in Milwaukee as owners. However if the NBA buys the team back from them the NBA won't be under that obligation.  Of course since no one has seen the agreement it's all speculation.
wisconsin,3d3x2i,toasters_are_great,3,Tue Jul 14 04:33:45 2015 UTC,"Thinking about it some more, my wild guess is that they have a $100 million penalty clause in the purchase contract with Kohl if the Bucks leave Milwaukee.  Hence if they stay, Kohl is effectively contributing the reported $100 million, which wouldn't make too much sense otherwise (yes, he wants the Bucks to stay local, but throwing that much money at a team you don't have any financial stake in any more is a bit much).  That way it'd only cost Kohl less than a $100 million discount on the team in order to keep them in Milwaukee, since there was always a good chance of the current owners being offered an acceptable public bribe, but he'd get $100 million worth of incentive to the current owners to stay.  Pure speculation on my part.  But it wouldn't make much sense to keep that restriction on the current owners but not pass on the restriction to future owners, since the entire point is to keep the Bucks in Milwaukee."
wisconsin,3d3x2i,crewblue,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:47:16 2015 UTC,"Any deal with Kohl still requires approval from the NBA. They always push for teams to stay in their locations, but they won't approve sales terms that make it difficult to move if necessary."
wisconsin,3d3x2i,toasters_are_great,2,Tue Jul 14 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"But that deal clearly was approved, because the ownership transfer happened last year."
wisconsin,3d3x2i,crewblue,2,Wed Jul 15 00:23:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was saying I don't think the league would allow something like a penalty for moving the team. I'm not 100% familiar with the terms of the sale but I'm not sure if Lasry and Arden's would even be allowed to move the team. They might be required to sell it back to the league at number that was mentioned a while ago."
wisconsin,3d3x2i,toasters_are_great,2,Wed Jul 15 00:26:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok, I see what you're saying now.  I can't say I agree, because clearly the #1 thing the NBA cares about with respect to the Bucks is that they get a stadium with bells and whistles attached in the next few years, whether that's in Milwaukee or Seattle or wherever.  If Edens and Lasry have a contract with Kohl that all else being equal happens to make it cheaper for them to keep the Bucks in Milwaukee, I'm not sure why the NBA would be interested in such details."
wisconsin,3d3x2i,MindOfGregJennings,2,Wed Jul 15 01:15:20 2015 UTC,"I believe in the deal Kohl gave them he gave them massive incentive to keep the team in Milwaukee.  From what I've heard/read, the owners can't just move the team to Seattle.  Kohl wanted to ensure that whoever bought the team would keep it in Milwaukee."

It lacks any mention of the particular situation in Milwaukee, which has not happened before - namely, that the city county and state all stand to lose substantial sums of money should the team leave. This was not the case in Seattle, nor is it the case now in San Diego with the Chargers or St Louis with the Rams. Nor was is the case with the Vikings in Minnesota or even the Brewers when they were looking for a new arena.

That then puts additional stress on the remaining workers, who have to pick up the slack until a new recruit can be found to repeat the process again.  Carly was terrible, just in objective terms, because HP's stock was lower when she left than when she came in. Somewhat more subjectively, her merger with Compaq was considered a big decision made for the sake of making a big decision, which was not in the best long term interests of the company. She also touted HP's history as a great R&D company in TV commercials while simultaneously gutting the R&D department.  These are all things that judge Carly as a CEO, not as a woman.

In this case, there was no valid reason for the strike, and the resulting mess that it created.   Replacing everyone would be a mess in any sector of the industry, and is doubly true here.

No, but for real, here's my take on his place in the republican primary:  He's really an establishment republican in everything but name. While Jeb Bush is the epitome of ""establishment"" because of his family ties, Walker has much of the same political ties. Walker's rise to fame has been because of his contacts (i.e. donors).  I think he'll promote himself as the ""working-class candidate."" Because many other candidates have Ivy League polisci and economics degrees, the Walker Campaign is going to paint them all as silver-spooned, whereas Walker came from nothing and didn't even need a degree to get there. He got there with hard work.  He's also painting himself already as hard-line republican, rather than trying to appeal to moderates it seems. This has worked for him in the recall election and 2nd term election I suppose, but I'm somewhat surprised. His entire speech was premised on taking down Obama. (He said in his speech he wanted to take down Obamacare, Sanctions with Iran, and... 1 other thing, maybe immigration NINJA EDIT: Keystone pipeline was #3) on DAY 1 in office.  It's always hard in politics to do pros and cons, since almost every major issue is debatable and is therefore either a pro or con depending on your stances. But here's where he stands on the issues:   More for a flat tax- large tax base and lower taxes for rich. More states-rights and smaller central government. Business friendly.

wisconsin,3d581o,Thonlo,9,Tue Jul 14 18:14:42 2015 UTC,It will be interesting how his opponents address his dropping out of college. Personally I think it would be a mistake by his republican/democratic foes.

What's problematic for him on this one is that his story about why he dropped out doesn't add up: apparently to support a family that didn't exist for another four years.  Perhaps he really, really liked the Red Cross so much that he quit Marquette with about a year's worth of credits to go.  But that's not the story he gave for reasons unclear."

wisconsin,3d581o,nyee,2,Tue Jul 14 02:03:19 2015 UTC,"Not the person you replied to but I've got a question about the new bill on abortion that was just passed.    Why is incest, specifically called out? If it was unwanted incest, like a father raped his daughter wouldn't that be classified under rape?  Or is the term incest used here when it would be say brother/sister, and just for fun with an accidental pregnancy?   Like I said this may be a stupid question, i was just wondering why rape/sexual assault wouldn't cover the incest as well."

wisconsin,3d581o,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"So then the term ""incest"" was added to clarify that some abortions are made due to incest causing fetus anomalies?   I was just confused to why incest is specifically called out."
wisconsin,3d581o,HeavyLeadBelly,7,Mon Jul 13 17:56:58 2015 UTC,"Incest, in the broader sense, is when immediate family members are sexually active with one another.  So it could be a parent, sibling, or grandparent, aunt/uncle, and in some states first cousins.  Rape, being non-consensual, would be different if these acts were done with consent.  A brother and sister of age in the state, having consensual sex with each other isn't rape, though that baby would have a seriously high chance of massive defect, and could easily threaten the life of a mother - but no one would know until 20 weeks.  The incest part is usually in there as a stopgap against the slippery-slope fallacy of ""what's to stop people from aborting if the fetus has [name disease here]?""  that many anti-choice advocates repeat, in my estimation."
wisconsin,3d581o,silentjay01,4,Mon Jul 13 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"I did some reading on the subject and found varying rates (46% in an old Czechoslovakian study and 15-20% in a more modern one for the child to have defects or miscarriage) for parental-child incest, which would be biologically worse than sibling for guaranteeing genetic similarities. It cuts down to 4% for cousins, from what basic Googling got me, which is nearing (but still double) the rates for women having children much later in life.  An interesting question would be if, from a purely legal definition, exceptions for incest also mean exceptions for people with, or carriers of, severe defects themselves that they are 20% likely to pass on."

wisconsin,3d4vr0,HeavyLeadBelly,4,Mon Jul 13 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"The guy who created the ""Wisconsin Sports Logo"" included the Packers, the Badgers, and the Brewers.  The Bucks where nowhere to be found.  Popular support for the team is down, they have been terrible for years, no real stars and no real impact on the state outside of Milwaukee, IMHO.  I don't want the Bucks to go to Seattle.  That being said, I don't want to pay for their stadium either.  Brown County paid an extra .5% tax for Lambeau Field for years...and we still are.    It's kind of an ugly situation.  New ownership is threatening us with moving the team, but I haven't heard a plan to make the Bucks worth watching again either.  What's the investment plan on their part to make the team popular and successful, a pride point for Wisconsin and Milwaukee?  I'd like to see that.  I'd like to say proudly that the Bucks are in Wisconsin rather than belatedly remembering ""Oh ya, we do have an NBA team."""
wisconsin,3d4vr0,gedvondur,3,Tue Jul 14 01:41:42 2015 UTC,The Bucks are actually looking up. I mean they took the Bulls to 6 games in the playoffs last year and that was without Jabari Parker who was injured. They've also just made some moves in free agency and it's starting to look like under the new owners they could be good. It would suck if they left just as they're getting good and went to a championship a couple years later like the Sonics did when they left Seattle or the Browns did when they left Cleveland.
wisconsin,3d4vr0,PackerBacker50,6,Tue Jul 14 20:57:49 2015 UTC,"New ownership isn't threatening that.

wisconsin,3d4vr0,gedvondur,2,Tue Jul 14 15:33:29 2015 UTC,"this seems to be the biggest misconception right now with the whole arena deal. the Bucks themselves are not threatening to leave Milwaukee. The NBA is threatening to take the Bucks if we don't figure out an arena deal. this is out of the hands of the owners. it's in their vested interest to keep the Bucks in Milwaukee because if the NBA takes the Bucks they would likely have to sell for less than they bought them for and then if they wanted to buy back they'd have to pay more than what they originally bought the team for. thats a lot of hoops to jump and a lot of money thrown down the toilet just to enact some conspiracy of the owners threatening to leave.    I haven't heard a plan to make the Bucks worth watching again either   have you been watching at all? the new owners lured Jason Kidd here from New York to coach Milwaukee. players love him, he's a proven 2 time NBA champion and in his 2 years coaching has taken two different run of the mill shitty teams to the playoffs in his first year as coach. he took the Bucks from our worst record ever last year and got us to 500 and in to the playoffs this year. in the offseason we signed Kris Middleton and brought in a highly coveted free agent in Greg Monroe. this means good players currently want to stay in Milwaukee and other free agents are sticking their nose to L.A and New York to come play in Milwaukee. The Bucks have also done and incredibly great job in drafting great young talent and trading for great young talent. the Bucks have a young core group of players that will be together for a good amount of time and will be of championship caliber. the Bucks right now are currently set for success. they're going to be exciting to watch and if they leave, all the state bandwagoners are going to by whining and complaining when the Seattle Bucks win the 2018 NBA Championship. (seriously guys it could happen, the Bucks are gonna be crushing)  another thing lost on the new owners is their plans to invest in the new buildings, hotels, parking structures, restaurants, and other entertainment venues directly around the arena. they want to transform downtown Milwaukee into a more vibrant place with an exciting vibrant talented team to watch and be proud of.      I'm a huge Bucks fan so sure I'm biased but I know people will regret losing them if we do."

I believe that Milwaukee is something like the 5th smallest market in the NBA or something, they are near the bottom though.  The 2013/14 season they were dead last in attendance, last year contending for the playoffs they were still 4th from the bottom in terms of attendance.  Other small market teams do fairly well like Utah, Portland, and Memphis year in and year out.  The Bucks have always been an afterthought in the scope of Wisconsin sports.  I'm a big NBA fan, and I would like to see the league as a whole get more viewers.    I think the new ownership group is doing a good job at trying to market the Bucks as a Wisconsin team instead of just a Milwaukee team, which seems to me as how they are viewed now, at least to me here in the Western part of the state.  Again, I hope they work something out and can remain in Milwaukee, but to an outsider it doesn't appear the team gets too much support."

Thompson was a Republican governor in Wisconsin during this time and didn't do well in the primaries when he ran.  Don't assume Walker can truly use this as a strength."
wisconsin,3d4lke,belandil,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:49:50 2015 UTC,Thompson never even made it to the primaries. He dropped out after the Iowa straw polls.

Today people probably consider it some kind of meth reference, since smurfs are meth cooker underlings.  It's basically saying, ""The land of the decongestant purchasers who are paid in meth for their service to the meth cookers of Lake Pier, Wisc.""

He chews his words and his accent sounds like a little Wis-caahhn-sin mixed with a Brooklyn mobster.  He really often times doesn't sound like he's from Wisconsin.

Generally used for meals or hotel charges, but not exclusively. For example most construction workers will shop at a grocery store with one days worth of per diem, and then bank the rest of the weeks per diem. Just because they don't spend it on meals doesn't mean it's not theirs.  What you're thinking of is a meal stipend or meal reimbursement, which is different than Per Diem."

No contributors have to be disclosed or reported.   These millions then get shuffled into other entities and go on to do really questionable things, most of which never get fully uncovered because there are so many entitites involved. An example though, would be voter initimidation, such as buying billboard space in low income areas that threaten jail to felon voters.  This wasn't supposed to be allowed, because it breeds stong outside influence from a small number of ""people"" or corporations, because corporations are people too.  There were also rules in place that even if an individual wasn't officially a registered candidate, but was ""testing the waters"" once they accumulated $5,000 in support, they were required to immediately register as a candidate and disclose all donors.  This is why the politicians lie about their their desire to be a candidate. Some how denial + nonregistration of candidacy = ability to collect money from millionaires and billionaires around the US into a pot.  What repurcussions has there been from poiticians fundraising for years while not being a candidate? None as far as I know.

Perhaps don't cut the UW as the exact same amount of the proposed Bucks stadium funding as a political ""fuck you"".  You know what loses us money too?

If we lose the Bucks, we have an issue that CAN NOT be solved.  And that $130 million our economy loses will impact taxes in the general fund.  Where do you think the Republicans are going to look for more funding?  Oh yeah, they won't.  They'll cut more funding to the UW."
wisconsin,3cv7rd,pgrit154,6,Sat Jul 11 04:51:03 2015 UTC,"And that $130 million our economy loses will impact taxes in the general fund.   As a rule of thumb, about 5% of GDP is captured by general fund taxes, so about $6.5m/year (that happens to line up exactly with Koskinen's last slide).  But what Koskinen doesn't do is look at anything more than the state pledge to a new arena, which is barely 1/5th of the public financing of it.  The $250 million breakdown is roughly:   $55m from state bonding. $80m from Milwaukee County, meant to be paid for by uncollected debt that the state would collect instead, but at the end of the day this is money from the County. $93m in bonding from the Wisconsin Center District, which comes from various taxes it sets in Milwaukee City and County on hotel rooms, car rentals and food and beverage. $35m parking structure from the City. $12m in tax incremental financing from the City.   Also:   $630m property tax break from the City and County per state law.   So as it currently is, it might make some sense from the point of view of the state as a whole, but ironically not necessarily so much for Milwaukee itself."

Well, Milwaukee stands to gain some of the local benefits that the rest of the state doesn't.  Milwaukee will have access to a world class entertainment facility that will raise property values in the surrounding area.  Milwaukee will gain and/or retain restaurants, bars, and retail shops within the complexes sphere of influence - resulting in retaining or gaining property tax revenue (and that lovely .5% county sales tax).  Further, Milwaukee will benefit from something that isn't exactly measurable - quality of life.    If local politicians can see that this is a good thing for Milwaukee, I'm not sure why the state would turn this down if it happens to be a pretty decent deal for everyone else."
wisconsin,3cv7rd,pgrit154,3,Sat Jul 11 14:58:39 2015 UTC,"Milwaukee will gain and/or retain restaurants, bars, and retail shops within the complexes sphere of influence - resulting in retaining or gaining property tax revenue (and that lovely .5% county sales tax).   Property tax, not so much: professional sports arenas and related facilities are exempt from property taxes.  If you mean restaurants/bar/shops outside the actual arena complex, well, they can be outcompeted by ones inside on the basis of both distance from the arena and money (because they don't have to pay property taxes while their competitors do, plus their owners just got a big subsidy from taxpayers).   Further, Milwaukee will benefit from something that isn't exactly measurable - quality of life.   True.  The City and County would be stumping up about $200 million for this, to a team which is worth $600 million.  If the team is so important for the area and such a guaranteed future tax revenue generator, why not simply have the local governments buy them instead (or at least a controlling stake)?  It'd cost four times as much (you'd still need the new arena, assuming it's actually true that the NBA has a contract with the Bucks requiring them to move away from BMO Harris Bradley Center, which I've never seen).  But then the local Milwaukee governments can keep all the profits too and never again have to worry about them moving away.  At least then they'd get some equity for their money."
wisconsin,3cv7rd,toasters_are_great,3,Sat Jul 11 16:19:09 2015 UTC,Exactly.   It's going to cost us more than what we get back in return.    But the TWO bucks fans in here can't stop CJ'ing to understand that.
wisconsin,3cv7rd,mnpilot,4,Sat Jul 11 12:44:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that it will cost Milwaukeeans more than they get in return, just that I've never seen a cost-benefit analysis that suggests they're better off because of it.  If they want to anyway, that's up to them.  I have three questions though:   If taxpayers are to pay for half the arena, why won't they own half the arena and get to charge the Bucks half the rent? How is this different from the WEDC throwing $$$'s at a private business and saying to them ""you don't have to create any jobs beyond short-term construction ones which don't have to be for Wisconsinites, you don't have to make any taxable profit, you get a permanent 100% property tax break and you don't have any other obligations except to not leave the state right now""? Is this the best thing that Milwaukeeans can do with $200 million of their money?  If you look at Appendix 5 of the last WEDC audit (pdf page 107), apparently creating or retaining jobs can be had at about $10,000 a pop.

Listen to the economist people!"
wisconsin,3cv7rd,legsintheair,4,Sat Jul 11 03:49:36 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Koskinen is only talking about the income taxes on (principally player) Bucks salaries vs the cost of the $50 million state part of the bonding.  The state will get to tax most of the salary cap of about $70 million/year and presumably rather more in future years at the top rate of 7.65%, or about $5 million/year (split between the Bucks and visiting teams).  Plus there'll be a few low-wage jobs at the arena, maybe some knock-on if people come and stay to do more things than just the game, plus 5% sales taxes so the state is very likely better off with this deal than without, just as Koskinen says.  On the other hand, the City & County of Milwaukee plus the Wisconsin Center District are to stump up about $200 million.  Using Koskinen's figure of the state debt service costs being $4 million annually, the debt service costs to local governments will be $16 million annually (and almost certainly more, since without looking it up the state government no doubt can borrow more cheaply).  Local governments will receive zero property tax from the new arena + complex (sports stadiums are already exempted in state statutes, not particular to this deal).  There is no local income tax of course.  That leaves the 0.5% local sales tax on Bucks tickets, concession sales and any other sales within the complex, plus the Wisconsin Center District taxes, plus any local stimulative effect it might have (which is arguable: sports arenas do not tend to cause local businesses to become more efficient like, say, improving transportation access generally might, and tend to vie for a relatively fixed amount of people's entertainment budgets which might otherwise go to other diversions.  But there will be at least some via visiting teams' attending fans who wouldn't otherwise be in Milwaukee).  But pretty much in order to pay for itself the new arena needs to generate at least $16 million / 0.5% = $3.2 billion (with a b) of additional taxable sales each and every year.  At 41 home games per season and a capacity of 17,000, then presuming every game is sold out, each and every attending fan would need to spend $4,500 per game - more if the local cost of borrowing is higher than the state's, less if there's a general stimulative effect with a fiscal multiplier above 1 - in order for local governments to break even.  Well, either that or $250 on a per-seat hotel stay (presumably though most attendees will be local fans, so this figure would be much higher).  Even presuming infeasibly large economic multipliers, they'll be nowhere close.  Unless I'm missing something pretty major (and please point out if I am), Milwaukeeans will have $10-15 million/year of higher taxes and/or reduced services if this deal goes through.   And this is why I don't understand why it's even an option to not build a new arena   I don't live in Milwaukee so perhaps this is OK with those who do, but it's pretty clear to me that not throwing $250 million at billionaires in exchange for no equity at all is a very viable option."

wisconsin,3cv7rd,littleclick,7,Sat Jul 11 05:20:17 2015 UTC,"Good question.  From their website:   The Wisconsin Center District (WCD) is a government body created under Wisconsin State Statute in 1994 to fund, build and operate the Midwest Express Center (now Wisconsin Center) in downtown Milwaukee, and continue operating the existing venues now called the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena and Milwaukee Theatre. Not a unit of state, county or city government, WCD is instead a semi-autonomous municipality called a ""district,"" meaning its leaders are appointed and it can issue bonds and collect taxes within strict limits.   Basically, districts have taxing and bonding authority over a specific area for a specific purpose.  A few different districts that you may be familiar with include ""business improvement districts"" (BIDS) that maintain urban furniture, garbage collection, and planters, and wayfinding signage in urban downtowns as well as ""regional transportation authorities/districts"" that levy taxes for transit projects over a region.    Wisconsin Center already exists, their taxing powers would simply be redefined.  This would come in the way that they use parking lot taxes, rental car taxes, and hotel taxes.  They would bond against this revenue stream to pay for their portion of the arena."

That is some bullshit that is being fed to you buy somebody who has ownership in the Bucks, and also own a company that builds arenas.    The only reason why the Bradley center needs all these repairs is because somebody just says it does.  There has been no compelling evidence that the stadium needs anything.    The last time they got money, the just used it to make the skyboxes smaller so they could sell more and make more money, and they bought a scoreboard.   If the building was in dire need of repairs, the people responsible are the board of directors for the Bradley Center.  However, if you look at who has owneship interest in the Bucks, and who is on the board of the center, there is too much conflict of interest."

Tearing it down and demolishing it would most likely be even more expensive with is being right downtown and contains some hazardous materials such as Freon.  Yes the Admirals are there but for how much longer. We won't attract a new team or buyer due to its age and repairs needed. It seems a bigger waste to forgo the opportunity to redevelop an area that is full of vacant buildings and open lots.  Yes there are hundreds of more issues that deserved that money and funding from the budget issues. The thing is the budget is pretty set and done it will be signed and that's the end of it. The bigger debate should be on this project and not what is has taken away from the new budget.  Some stadium projects have been exceptions to the rules and increased and restarted development.

The Bradley Center has a board of directors, and it is up to them to fundraise and manage their cost of operations.    The problem is that some people on the Bradley Center board are literally in bed with Governer Walker, i.e. Grebe. Others have an ownership interest in the bucks, which is a huge conflict of interest.  There is no reason for the board to be motivated to look out for the best interest in the center, because Grebe asks for money from Scott Walker, and Walker just shovels it out to him.    Do you own investigation in regards to how many times The Bradley board asked Walker for money money money, and Walker said OK.  Then look into what they actually spend the money on, and ask yourself why they did that, if the building was in such dire straits.  In fact, in this arrangement they want, the Bradley Center still gets another 10 million more dollars. Why?  If this board can't make the center profit, there is no way a different center with less seating would be any more profitable.  The board of directors for the bradley center get paid to do jack shit for the actual center.   Its really disrespectful to Jane Pettit Bradley.    Has anybody heard about anybody from the Pettit-Bradley family coming forward and publicly exclaiming, ""We can't wait for you to rip down this 90 million dollar gift?""  I personally think the board trustees have done a great disservice, and I believe they are simply motivated by greed."

Non partisan attorneys reviewed all documentation and determined that the state itself had no obligation to make any repairs.   The center does, however, have a board of directors and trustees, and there should be some obligation from them to act in good faith and fundraise and make efforts to attract events etc.  If they can't do that, then they should be relieved of duty, and other trustees should be brought in that are willing to do the work.

Republicans talk about cutting welfare so people on it can't buy Lobster, then turn around and hand out this thing on a silver platter.    Maybe just let Marquette and Admirals use it, it seems to fit them well enough.   Such a turd sandwich."
wisconsin,3cv7rd,belandil,2,Sat Jul 11 20:12:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, it is a messed up situation. We should have taken the deal from the Menominee's no doubt about.  Marquette won't contribute any funds towards the building so I doubt they will want to renew their contract with the BMO Harris Center if the Bucks leave. I love the admirals but I don't think they could afford being the only ones.  It is a messed up choice. For myself in my opinion I feel like keeping them might be the lesser of the two evils, however only time will tell."

wisconsin,3cv7rd,wiscobadgers24,2,Sat Jul 11 19:32:03 2015 UTC,You said nothing about the NBA player salary tax revenue which was the main point of this video.
wisconsin,3cv7rd,Cyno01,-3,Sat Jul 11 20:32:04 2015 UTC,"His argument: The NBA brings money into the state mainly through broadcasting rights, part of which ends up as salary and is taxed, thereby justifying the expenditure.  I question if the NBA is such a cash cow why investors/owners can't make the investment in the stadium themselves.  According to Koskinen, it's more or less a sure bet that they'll make their money back.  Why must the state do it?  Why not the city?    Why are we supporting this endeavor and not other things which bring back returns on investment (the UW system and rail in particular)?  tl;dr: Fuck the Bucks, get on the train."
wisconsin,3cv7rd,zmichalo,2,Sat Jul 11 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"First of all, the city is making a significant contribution to the arena and the funding package itself was a bipartisan plan formulated by reps from the city, county and state.   Secondly, the state benefits greatly from the Bucks remaining in the Wisconsin just from the income taxes generated by the players alone. This doesn't even take into account any multiplier effects from the Bucks, which there are many.  I'm assuming your point about why investors/owners can't make the investment themselves is just a naive misunderstanding of the way professional sports/businesses in general work. The Bucks only make ~$11M annually in profit, which is a paltry return on the Bucks owners investment ($550M to purchase + $150M for arena). Even if you include the money generated from non-NBA events, these teams aren't necessarily ""cash cows"" for the owners. Now the Bucks owners are fine with that because of the prestige of owning a professional franchise and any appreciation of the Bucks value that may occur, but to expect them to buy the franchise for $550M and then plug an additional $500M into an arena is an absurd ask. A lot of people ask why the Bucks owners don't just take out a loan, but no bank in the world would loan $250M to a business that makes $11M annually after expenses are deducted. That's why arenas/stadiums in smaller markets have to be a combination of private and public investment.  There are four groups that benefit from the arena being built: Bucks owners, the city of Milwaukee, Milwaukee county, and the state of Wisconsin. All four groups would be worse off if the Bucks were to leave for another city. Bucks ownership get to own a professional sports team, the city of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County gets a world-class arena and an estimated $500M in ancillary development (property taxes + quality of life for citizens), and the state of Wisconsin ensures the +$10M in income taxes generated each year by NBA players continues"
wisconsin,3cv7rd,mst3kcrow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:32:17 2015 UTC,"Suppose some company is toying with the idea of setting up a new factory in Milwaukee.  Their factory is expected to cost $500 million.  Investors have pledged $250 million and are asking the State to give them $220 million.  The factory will employ about 100 people, but several of the employees will earn a lot of money and are expected to generate $10 million in income tax each year.  The factory is expected to make $11 million in profit each year, and their revenues are expected to grow quite a bit over the next few years as their product is delivered to new markets.    However, the State will have no ownership of the factory, and there is no guarantee that the factory will not be shuttered and its jobs sent to another state.  $20 million of the State's funding will actually go to paying down debt from existing factory which is considered obsolete.    Would you support building this factory?    Pish posh you might say.  You just replaced ""stadium"" with ""factory.""  But remember that the Milwaukee Bucks are a corporation.  Their official title is Milwaukee Bucks, Inc..  Just because many people like their product doesn't mean they should be treated differently than any other corporation.  This scenario isn't that different from the GM bailout, but in that case the federal government took partial ownership of GM, and actually sold their shares for a profit a few years later.  Why can't the State government require some ownership of Milwaukee Bucks, Inc.?"
wisconsin,3cv7rd,zmichalo,2,Sun Jul 12 19:22:13 2015 UTC,"Well the state does invest in ""factories"" or ""businesses"" that are deemed important to the state for a lot more than $4M annually. Now we can argue if that is a smart investment, but the state (and most others) already invest in companies to protect income tax revenues. People are just so adamantly against this investment because it's a sports team.  Listen if people really think it's a good idea to let +$10M of tax revenue walk out the door over a $4M a year investment by the state, then I guess that's your opinion but I also question how well you did in math in high school. Not to mention the huge loss in reputation that Milwaukee (and by extension the state) would face if they were unable to keep their professional sports team. This isn't some ""evil"" owner that moved the team overnight, this would be a clear case of a state being unwilling or unable to invest in itself. If I'm an out of state business why would I all of a sudden move jobs to Wisconsin if the state has shown such an unwillingness to support something that actually makes financial sense.   I know a lot of people use the argument, well I don't like the Bucks so this is dumb. But the fact of the matter is a lot of young professionals are moving away from baseball and to the NBA, and the fact is having the Bucks in Milwaukee improves the quality of life for a lot of people in and around the state's largest city. To discount that just on a matter of principal I think is really really narrow-minded."

You can't revitalize Milwaukee by taking money out of their public schools, attacking the UW system, all while voucher crooks fly to Florida with state money.  It doesn't feel like some fantasy revitalization.  It feels like a shakedown with $250 million dollars being a political fuck you, as that's the amount the UW budget was cut.   A husband and wife running a private Milwaukee voucher school that abruptly closed last month — after accepting a total of more than $2.3 million in taxpayer money — now live in a gated community in Florida by the beach, records show."

The cherry on top is that Jon Hammes just did a good job of convincing Democrats to tell him to go fuck himself.   You've gotta pick your battles, and losing this team won't do any good for the state.    If only this same amount of concern was given to the giveaway to Enbridge which was in the budget.

Anyways I really do not think Walker has a shot.  He lacks education and experience. That may be just fine for a mayor or even a governor but that will not go over well in a presidential run. Bottom line is, if Walker is the GOP pick then the GOP will be handing the white house over to the Dems. for the third time in a row."

In fact, I will not reply to this thread unless asked. I will be removing notifications regarding responses. Not that I don't care, I'll read them, but I want open comments without me hovering.   Riiiiiiiiiight. That's why you are commenting all over the place, including personally invoking mods to step in. Absolutely no hovering there. Sure.   I don't mean to disrespect anybody, but I am finding this amusing the more this goes on.   Prefacing your statement with ""I don't mean to disrespect anybody"" does not make this any less of a long-winded attempt to turn this sub into your own personal soapbox.  Try going outside, for crying out loud."

Three, if you call me out personally and not respond to the message, I believe I have the right to defend myself."

Walker stealing education from thousands of Wisconsin students is more important than your cool picture of the Apostle Islands.  The republican majority gerrymandering themselves into continued power despite flagging popularity is more important than a review of a really neat restaurant in Madison.  The systematic pillage of tax payer funds to go into the pockets of millionaires while our state's largest economic engine (The UW) gets defunded is more important than a nice picture of the Fox River.  The fact that Walker is jetting around the world on the Wisconsin taxpayers dime while pretending not to be running for president until Monday is more important than a story about catching panfish in the northwoods.  Here's the facts: WE ARE GETTING SCREWED. And some people are bitching because we speaking up about it (even if it is just to each other). Well sorry if this sub isn't all camping stories and bratwursts and beer and fishing trips, but shit is really bad right now, and there are a lot of us who are pretty fucking pissed about it. You want the old version of /r/Wisconsin back? Vote Walker out. I guarantee we'll go back to talking about the packers and camping within a couple weeks."

But only one opinion mattes in this sub, and if you're not of that opinion you will be down voted to oblivion.   If i posted a ""pro-walker"" opinion piece it would never get above the 1 up vote, that it gets automatically from me posting it.   If this sub, could handle opinion pieces from both sides it wouldn't be as bad requiring posts such as OP's to have more non-political articles posted.   Heck even look at my post you replied to. Already at -2, with only your response. People see something that doesn't fit with their ideology and they down vote. I never said anything that wasn't true.

You're not going to change the hearts and minds people here, so unless you're a digital masochist, it doesn't make much sense.  You have a right to your opinion, but you don't have a right to make other people like or accept it. You don't have a right to upvotes. You don't even have a right to make people listen to it, which is why you get downvoted so quickly. We've all heard the right-wing reasoning, and the sickening lies and oppression that go with it. That's why nobody is giving your posts the time of day.   Like it or not, this is what /r/Wisconsin is now, because that's what Wisconsin is now. As I said before, once the republicans are no longer grossly throwing their weight around, this sub will go back to Packers and bratwursts. Until then, this is how it's going to be.

wisconsin,3cytsx,jrice441100,3,Mon Jul 13 15:06:32 2015 UTC,"I come here because I do like to see a lot of the articles posted here. I'm don't really have to many hard lined views, so it's nice to read and see a lot of the other comments. I can just understand where the OP is coming from.   And i'm not trying to force people to look at a different point of view. No one has to read an article about how Scott Walker is amazing (hyperbole), but they should at least know/recognize if he has done something positive. It's not good for ANY group to only listen to their views. Now right now there might not be any positive news to know about.   Also, you don't have to agree with Walker but the tone in this sub is very discouraging. You can dislike walker and disagree with his policy all you want, but do it with some decorum?    To those of you that still stand with this asshole all I can say is go fuck yourselves.   It's comments like these that are up voted. Do you think Scott Walker is an Asshole? Cool if you think he is, but saying shit like this just looks poorly on the sub. Does /r/conservative say the same shit about Hilary? Probably but I never go there. You don't have to agree with people to be polite.   Be better than those you disagree with. Posts don't have to be vulgar to make a point.   I understand Reddit is a comment area where you can say what you want, and vent if needed. I just personally think all of the ""attack"" words/comments (even if they are justified) could be worded more civilly.   Edit: Hell even in one of your other responses you resort right to a personal attack of ""go watch another NASCAR race"". Sure the other poster started it, but doesn't mean you have to go to his level. Ignore his comment and don't reply. Personal attacks add NOTHING to the conversation and is what I dislike about this sub."
wisconsin,3cytsx,120z8t,3,Mon Jul 13 15:14:44 2015 UTC,"Have an upvote for a reasonable response.  A civil tone would make it more pleasant to be sure, but in responses to that:  1) This site is primarily middle-to-upper-class white males between the ages of 16 and 30. This is a group that may not have completely matured into civil discourse yet. I know I threw around plenty of profanity as a younger man. Asking for them to speak civilly may not be in their nature yet.  2) Responding with ""NO"" to your request for civility is not necessarily unwarranted. From their (our - I include myself in this group) perspective, in the last four years this administration has destroyed K-12 public schools, defunded a world-class university system, destroyed the DNR, broken our state parks, made it harder for small businesses, lost millions upon millions of dollars into the ether, gerrymandered themselves into power for the foreseeable future, and done so while proclaiming the other side to be awful. And then you ask us to be civil when we complain about it. To make a comparison, if I came over to your house, splashed gasoline all over it, and was pulling a lighter out of my pocket, would you say ""Excuse me, sir, but I think I disagree with what you're doing,"" or would you race out of your house screaming at me? Because for a lot of us, that's how we feel. This administration isn't just trying to burn our house down, they've already lit up the garage and it's spreading to the roof. So don't be surprised if we don't stand to the side and politely ask them to stop."

(totally made these two up below)    You're fucking crazy, go back to the woods   vs.    ""you're fucking crazy for supporting the new Bucks arena. Plenty of studies show public funding for private sports teams does not have a positive impact on the community.    Again many people will ignore studies, but if they do just stop responding.

Oil pipelines are controversial, no doubt.  As long as we chew up oil and pull it from Canada, pipelines will be needed, or more rail infrastructure.  It's gotta go one way or another.  Pipeline seems the least variable in terms of safety, but I agree with further review.   I tend to agree with rational environmental scientists, not necessarily the EPA or whatever Facebook stupidity crawls across my screen on a daily basis.  Or tell the Canadians to build their own pipeline to one of their coasts.   But that has social and political costs as well....  Long story short, if you talk to people that aren't raging idiots politically, I think you'll find republicans that don't fit your description, but you have to be willing to talk to them like human beings."

It makes no difference to an employer whether they have 10 employees working six days a week or 12 employees working five days a week. What does matter is that said employees aren't resentful about the numbers of days they work, seeing that it will increase turnover if they are.   How about a bill mandating that every consecutive shift after 6 gets paid double time?   Has it ever occurred to you that some people might want to work more than six consecutive days?

IANAL but it's pretty obvious that building a road that anyone can use is for public use; building a railroad that takes public passengers, sure; building power transmission lines to bring electricity to the public, sure; building a railroad that takes goods from private sellers to their customers, that's starting to push it a little; building a particular pipeline to move oil liquids around subject to the approval of gubernatorial appointees is pretty much the same.  I don't think that calling it in the public interest would be particularly tricky: the obvious alternative is taking the product to its destination by rail - which has its own issues compared to a pipeline - and in a petroleum-addicted society such as ours, ensuring supply is probably pretty easy to establish as public use.

I would expect these sorts of situations to be handled much earlier in the timeline. Though there could be extenuating circumstances because everyone is different and reacts differently.   Second, if you think abortion is murder, why is it ok to murder if the ""person's"" parents were raped or related? It just doesn't flow logically for me.   To the point of rape, you have to decide who you favor more:   The baby who had no choice in the matter The woman who was forced to have the baby   Rape is a traumatic experience. To ask a woman to have a reminder of that for 9 months or longer could pose significant emotional distress. In the extreme case, this could lead to suicide or similar outcomes.   The incest point, the only argument I could point to is that the possibility of genetic defects could be significantly higher in this case. You often do not find out about these problems until at or just after the 20 week mark. This time frame is also dependent on how easy it is to schedule things in a timely manner with your provider. But these scans usually do not take place before 20 weeks. However, this affects ALL pregnancies as well. This is the primary reason I am against the 20 week timeline as it does not really allow enough time to determine if there is any possible life altering/threatening issues with the fetus. Technology is making this happen faster, but it requires that all health care providers keep up-to-date."

Under Bush43, January 2001 - January 2009 it rose from 17.0% to 18.6%. Under Clinton, January 1993 - January 2001 it dropped from 17.4% to 17.0% despite a 1994 change in how it was measured that saw it increase by 2 percentage points (the exact change was that if someone said they worked full-time in the reference week, they weren't previously asked if that was their normal number of hours.  So some part-timers who happened to have been given some extra hours in the survey reference week were being counted as full-timers). Under Bush41, January 1989 - January 1993 it stayed at 17.4%.

That means it's trending toward the reactionary right with rough parallels to fascism. Why would Walker prefer an obviously oppressive mode of production (feudalism) when that oppression can all be concealed through neoliberal (capitalism) economics?  Edit: Is there some confusion with the terms I'm using?  It's ridiculous that the top comment is some incredible nonsense about feudalism.  Neoliberalism: Resurgence of 19th century ideas associated with laissez-faire economic liberalism beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, whose advocates support extensive economic liberalization policies such as privatization, fiscal austerity, deregulation, free trade, and reductions in government spending in order to enhance the role of the private sector in the economy. Neoliberalism is famously associated with the economic policies introduced by Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan in the United States."

But well I think today's conservatives are far to the right of any neoliberal. Today's Tea Party conservative like Walker even eschew any pro business policy if it makes the government seem effective.  They want to tear down the system completely.

wisconsin,3cob3b,mnpilot,8,Thu Jul 9 15:40:23 2015 UTC,"Not true, there's still great value to be had in state schools. Eau-Claire, as an example, while the class sizes will increase, some faculty will leave, some programs are being dropped, and it'll be more difficult to graduate in 4 years, still presents a solid value. In-state tuition is 8.8K a year as of the April projections, with some scholarships for class rank/ACT it can easily go down to 3K a semester. Reciprocity with MN still hasn't been finalized (universities aren't releasing information for WI residents) but the very comparable Mankato State is 7.9K/year for MN residents. Yeah, it's not the best deal but staying closer to home means going without a car is a lot easier and that can make up the difference. I will be staying in the UW System because buying, insuring, and maintaining a car would make MN schools with a comparable education more expensive. I typed this on mobile so apologies in advance if something makes no sense.  EDIT: I posted this because I dispute your last sentence: the UW schools have fantastic programs, and each school has done what it can to insulate its flagship programs. If you know what you're looking to study, the UW still has fantastic programs in almost every field between the campuses. The quality of non-flagship programs are what were hurt the most by these cuts, for example most campuses cut smaller languages like Japanese. They may be a bit more expensive than their MN alternative, but they are still competitive at what they're best at."

If staying close to home is a value, that's pretty much all UW System schools have left to offer."

Now it's relatively easy to overlay databases of party members, derived voter profiles, campaign contributors, (or databases of ethnicity - whatever you can imagine) etc. over the top of accurate house-by-house maps. A computer will help you slice-and-dice to favor one party over another.  Note the carving-out of individual homes on cul-de-sacs.   In Jorgensen's case, the Republicans very purposefully carved his home out of his original district and into another. He decided to move his family.

On the other hand, this one Senator is leaving the state and in doing so forces legislative leaders to move faster to pass the Budget, which coincidentally doesn't give the public any time to get to know the other 66 items sprung upon Wisconsin with no public input or notice late last Thursday.  Not exactly seeing any inconsistency here if that's what you're implying: in both cases the WisGOP doesn't want the public to know what's going on until it's already law."

However, there was one line from the article that left me with several questions.    Vouchers schools on the whole perform worse than the Milwaukee Public Schools.   Was this a comparison between MPS and the voucher schools in Milwaukee, or did it include the schools that are part of the expanded state wide voucher program? What standard was used to make this discernment?"
wisconsin,3cle4t,CaptainGlobal,7,Wed Jul 8 23:27:41 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that the reason they want to privatize the schools and voucher schools are because they don't have to have any accountability at all. Or any kind of test to see how good the schools are.    There was a school near me the two hundred thousand dollars in grants a couple years ago and then they dipped out to Florida with no legal recourse.

When something happens that attracts citizen and media attention (whether or not it was their fault), the volume of requests increases, and that only intensifies their dislike. If they get negative press because of what happened, they'll direct some anger at the requests that prove the details of what happened.  On the other hand, as we saw in Walker's county exec office, when an open records request comes from an organization that they regard as friendly to their cause, the request can be fulfilled within hours, whereas the requests from people they regard as the opposition can take weeks or months and cost thousands of dollars."

For recourse, you can file a writ of mandamus on your own for immediate action $$$, or you can beg the local DA or the state AG for an opinion, which might take months. The fines are small and rarely applied.  The biggest sticks are the threat of court cases and bad press. If a legislator wants to test their favorite interpretation of the law, the public picks up the legal bills, as we saw with Erpenbach, Vukmir, etc."

Of course it's generally pretty darn unlikely they are going to be interested in going after their own ""clients"". I read the laws myself and confirmed that's how it is written.

If it is accrued PTO, then it would be recorded and accounted for in their bookkeeping.  They can't just remove it from the books without a corresponding debit account (edit: debit acount for bookkeeping, not banking.  Not sure how much you know about accounting so I figured should be safe and clarify).  If it is exactly how you say, which I obviously don't know, she should contact HR and ask about it.  As long as she makes her case, something should be resolved.  If you have paid vacation days, those hours should have remained in her vacation time bank.

With the way labor laws are written in this state, anybody can be terminated for any reason, at any time, as long as they are not terminated based on race, sex, age or sexual orientation.  If I choose to take time off, for whatever reason, like rest or family, and you don't, it is very possible that I could be terminated and replaced with someone who will. Based solely on economic theory, you might think this is positive, however, economic theory always considers these things in a vacuum with ""all else being equal"" assumptions.

wisconsin,3cgub2,_JustAnotherLurker_,85,Tue Jul 7 20:21:40 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion:  I think its because initially he appealed to a lot of average people.  In 2010 he talked about how it was irresponsible for Wisconsin to take stimulus money as his predecessor did and as other states had done and were continuing to do, because they are funds that need to be paid back.  He made references to the mortgage crisis, and made parallels to how something similar would happen with the state if it just kept taking stimulus packages that in the future would not be able to be paid back.  He talked about how he would spend the public's tax dollars responsibly; as if it were his own money.  He went on to talk about this massive plan he had for job creation, during the mortgage crisis when people couldnt afford their homes and were going into foreclosure left and right.  He explained this amazing plan where he would establish relationships with Wisconsin Companies, local corporations and help stimulate job growth, which would benefit the entire state.  Everybody ate this up.  How could this possibly go wrong?    Then the companies took the money and ran. The millionaires and billionaires saw how easy it was to manipulate legislation to their advantage, and alluded to all kinds of promises, and nothing really happened.  I honestly dont think he meant for this to happen, (maybe he should have finished his college degree) but I think these large companies and millionaires and billionaires saw it from a mile away.  There was no incentive for them to ""create jobs"" but there was plenty of incentive for them to take the money and run, and have legislation changed so that it tips in their favor.  Allowng them to profit more, and never create more jobs.  i.e. Kohls taking 62.5 million and not creating 3,000 jobs.  This happend over and over and over again.  I think Walker was too busy day dreaming that he was the president, and ultimately fell asleep at the wheel.    In the meantime, Chris Abele seems to have noticed that there is more promising avenues for job growth and job creation.  He started a program that involves regional startups, and if they are successful, they get investors.  This is now starting to involve BrightStars, and interestingly enough, WEDC.  Why didn't WEDC see the value in investing in start-ups in 2010.  Walker never mentioned the value in job growth by investing in new ideas, in 2010 he never talked about venture capital or seedfunding etc.    I think Scott Walker is starting to lose support.    Disrupting public education, and taking money from the public school district for the benefit of the Walton family, a Gap Inc heir, Bradley Foundation, and Oil company heirs doesn't really sit well with public school teachers and  families with children attending public across the state.   His legislation is increasingly favoring extremely wealthy outside interests and more people are noticing.  There is a small number of people bankrolling this guy, and this is why PACs are bad.  There is no incentive for him to have consideration for the average person, when all he needs a few checks from the millionaires and billionaires that end up ultimately benefitting.  I don't see him winning this election, unless he finds some amazing way to restore public trust.  I also don't think bankrolling more billionaires with a basket ball arena and development is going to restore pubic trust, that is only going to piss more people off."

In the end, Walker and his legacy are going to do more good to the country (and hopefully the state in the long term) than the short term harm they have caused, but it has been a tough lesson. I just hope the majority of people actually remember it and don't let themselves fall victim in future elections"

You're also deluding yourself if you think he was somehow a benign, happy little politician who was caught up by corporations and millionaires, and somehow had all these things happen to him, poor little circumstance-buffeted Scotty in the big ocean.

We have black, white, poor, rich, and everything in between, we have it all.    While checking to see who my state reps were today, I came across this website: http://maps.legis.wisconsin.gov/.  If Assembly Districts 13 and 14 are not evidence of gerrymandering I do not know what is.  If you split the district closer to the Milwaukee/Waukesha county line you would likely have one Dem and one Repub rep, but because both districts go deep into Brookfield and Elm Grove you get two Repubs.

There aren't many terribly rich people, yet there aren't many terribly poor people. Those pockets certainly exist, but it's not too prevalent. Did you know that the first on-duty Tosa police office was killed within the last few years? Not by a gangbanger, but by her boyfriend/fiancee.  My house in Tosa was built around 1930, which is around 92nd and North. If you go out to the border of Tosa around 124th St, you'll find the white-flight houses of the 50's and 60's. Tosa wasn't quite white-flight territory; you're definitely thinking of Waukesha County and its municipalities (Elm Grove, Brookfield, Waukesha, Delafield, Hartford, etc.). Those are the strongholds of the rich white Republicans.   Also, you do realize that a lot of people get killed in the inner city, right? You realize that almost all shootings in the inner city are black-on-black relating to drug deals? You realize just how shitty of a situation MPS is in? You realize how little investment there is in those people, right? No wonder people talk about it; it's not a good life for anyone! There's nothing wrong with talking about all of that stuff, though. However, we need to make sure that we don't classify all inner-city blacks in the same boat as those wrecking other people's lives, especially on mass media reaching older, wealthier folk from the suburbs.

This seems to be the driving factor in the majority of my extended family just blindly voting Republican, and I have to imagine that the more rural you get, the more religion becomes a factor."
wisconsin,3cgub2,KevinSorboFan,5,Wed Jul 8 01:13:18 2015 UTC,"I've been there too, North of Greenbay in small Catholic churches that came as close as ""fire and brimstone"" that I care to get.   The absolutely crazy part is I was friends with our priest just outside of Madison and his sermons were full of love and understanding where the stuff up North spoke of the lack of decency and morality in ""today's culture"". It almost felt like a bad John Hughes movie with the priest from central casting.   The interesting thing that I saw was the parishes up North were tiny and very old while the parishes around Madison were very young and large, which gave me high hopes for the future.   I'm not sure that churches necessarily drive people at the polls, but the idea that ""The Bible says this, so I'm right and all of the Christians are with me"" is pretty persuasive in their mind, regardless of what's being said in the churches. Considering the crumbling of church attendance in the rural areas, the church has less sway than the armchair prophets."
wisconsin,3cgub2,Abzug,5,Wed Jul 8 02:02:25 2015 UTC,"I will mention that I grew up either in or around Green Bay and attended the little Catholic churches you and u/Abzug are talking about.  While I admit that anti-gay/anti-abortion teachings are present, by no means does that make every parish in that area ""fire and brimstone.""  My parish never jumped on that bandwagon, and my catholic undergrad didn't either (heck, they brought in Gloria Steinem and Bell Hooks to talk just this year!)  Individuals in those parishes, however, spoke quite loudly about voting in accordance with the Church.  They were the overwhelmingly vocal minority in an otherwise unspoken moderate majority, as u/Abzug says about armchair theologians.   TL;DR - Catholic communities of NEW are not as conservative as they appear, and are becoming more moderate to liberal as generations come in and out."
wisconsin,3cgub2,CattMristoff,4,Wed Jul 8 04:27:50 2015 UTC,"I could believe that. Like I said, I'm just judging off of my own family members who really have no reason to vote conservative besides religion.   And it looks like we shared the same undergrad school!"
wisconsin,3cgub2,KevinSorboFan,3,Wed Jul 8 14:43:10 2015 UTC,"Go Green Knights!  I honestly was both shocked and really frustrated that Hooks/Steinem came.  Shocked for obvious reasons, but then also super frustrated because what I wouldn't have given to be present in Walter to listen to them talk...living American legends.    And that's fair, I'm sure you can believe that, but yes, every family is different.  I'm bi, and it's not like my family is asking every time I'm coming home if I'm bringing someone back anymore.  But then again, I'm also not threatened and ex-communicated.  It's definitely not open as open can be, but it's also not like I'm afraid to walk around my hometown and be who I am.  I'm very grateful for that."

Now?  More pragmatic, reasonable, and less judgmental.  Still Catholic, but very much about this new Pope guy.  Some rough stuff happened in our family over the last year, and he's been doing the service year thing, so I imagine the combination of academic setting and front-row seats for life experience have helped."
wisconsin,3cgub2,no_soul_ginger,3,Wed Jul 8 16:56:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. The parish I belong to is laid back and preaches love thy neighbor, not do as God says or burn in hell. In fact, a couple weeks ago the pastor specifically called out that it's gods place to judge, not ours."

wisconsin,3cgub2,chitwin,5,Thu Jul 9 12:34:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said with the exception of the Lean Government program (including the arena).  The Lean Government program is based on the principled of Lean Six Sigma, a program aimed curiously at jobs that have a definitive end game - i.e. manufacturing (widget in, widget out).    What is interesting about this is that state employees end up getting trained in this program (at a huge cost) while coming up with an idea for improving an existing process.  Most state employee tasks aren't process driven, and require a great deal of professional judgement, institutional knowledge, and common sense.  The things that are process driven (e.g. budgeting) are not influenced by Lean, since they are dictated by contracts, past spending, and how easy they are to implement.  Lean projects end up being incredibly basic - how to speed up an approval process, for instance. Things are flow charted, and a new process is created then presented to a group of all impacted employees.  A new process is then created - usually just as arduous, but now with a new flow chart.  Many of these projects could have been improved with common sense, rather than a gimmicky program developed by a self-help guru.  Just my two sense.  I'm just not big on Lean Six Sigma."

I'm getting my Lean credentials right now and it is more than just manufacturing. Healthcare loves this stuff too and once you pass the entry level class you are pushed into buckets for manufacturing and business process flow.  Things like bureaucratic red tape (redundant sign offs), building layouts (printers next to filing cabinets), and simple order/time management can be trimmed with Lean Six Sigma. It is worthwhile for office environments, the key part though is the decision makers actually have to hit the ground floor to see the whole process and listen to the people that do it day in and out."
wisconsin,3cgub2,KEM10,2,Wed Jul 8 05:28:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it can work depending on the work environment.  In state government, however, there are so many administrative divisions that it takes a great deal of training to get the infrastructure in place (department, division, bureau, section or unit).    The directive is to train someone in each of the lower levels, meaning thousands of people must take the training.  Much of what could be effective is out of the hands of the people training (red tape is a great example), so suggestions of offered that don't go anywhere.  The people getting trained get disheartened, and find that this new training makes them super valuable in the private sector.  And they leave.  I've seen it.  Doesn't make a ton of sense if it isn't really going to be fully implemented.    The only thing I've tangibly seen from the program is an increased focus on performance management.  This is both good and bad.  The good is glaring weaknesses are uncovered, making it possible for management to make adjustments accordingly.  The bad is that things that shouldn't be measured are being measured - taking a TON of extra time and effort with little to no benefit.  You know, for the sake of Lean.  Because it is a directive, and the box must be checked."

The Lean Six Sigma concepts were first published in a book titled Lean Six Sigma: Combining Six Sigma with Lean Speed by Michael George and Robert Lawrence Jr. in 2002. Lean Six Sigma utilises the DMAIC phases similar to that of Six Sigma. The Lean Six Sigma projects comprise the Lean's waste elimination projects and the Six Sigma projects based on the critical to quality characteristics. [clarification needed] The DMAIC toolkit of Lean Six Sigma comprises all the Lean and Six Sigma tools. The training for Lean Six Sigma is provided through the belt based training system similar to that of Six Sigma. The belt personnel are designated as white belts, yellow belts, green belts, black belts and master black belts, similar to karate.  For each of these belt levels skill sets are available that describe which of the overall Lean Six Sigma tools are expected to be part at a certain Belt level. These skill sets provide a detailed description of the learning elements that a participant will have acquired after completing a training program. The level upon which these learning elements may be applied is also described.

wisconsin,3cgub2,Oliver_Cockburn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:29:39 2015 UTC,"Deleting my original post and pasting the text of it here for mysterious reasons.  If you want serious answers, here you go. If you just wanted to start a circlejerk, here you go.  The motherfucker (and the people who support him) can play the game. You only need 50% of the electorate to win. If you can push the right buttons to get that 50%, it doesn't matter what you do afterwards, as long as you can push the right buttons again in 3 years. I remember watching his campaign against Burke being absolutely dumbfounded how someone could essentially say they wanted to do away with the minimum wage only to receive cheers and applause. He knows how to frame an argument in such a way that his supporters will get excited about it and people who don't think about what he actually just said for more than 15 seconds or do any research will think that he's got a good idea. To be able to essentially say shit like ""I want to make it so you can be literally paid absolutely nothing for your work, but I want this so you can have the freedom to make more money because your employer will want to pay you more"" is a power that he has mastered. It's like watching the physical embodiment of a D&D character who stuck an 18 in Charisma and spent all of his gold, feats, and skill points into Charisma/social skill boosting.  It's not just Walker, either. His team and PACs are amazing at pulling this off. After the last election, I showed one of my friends (a gun nut of the highest degree) this ad to see his reaction. Despite the fact that on nearly every issue (aside from gun control) he sits to the left of center, he was outraged and said that he would gladly join the armed revolution against Burke if she had tried to take his guns away, and he said that he was glad that Walker had won solely because of what the ad said. In 30 seconds, an ad composed of less than 50 words was able to convince someone to act completely against their self-interest and become angry at a candidate the ad didn't even mention, for something the ad didn't even say she would do. That's the power of rallying single issue voters.  I know people who like him because of his stance on guns, a general dislike of Democrats, the perception that he's taking from the urban centers and giving to the rural areas, religious freedom (to discriminate,) etc. The guy attracts single-issue voters like flies. Those people are Republican voters and will never stop being Republican voters. What interests me are the people who support him who don't vote like they're looking at an All Star ballot.  People's motivations for liking a particular candidate can have nothing to do with that candidate's actual stances on most issues. Plenty of people vote for someone based on completely irrelevant things with regard to their policies. Skin color, age, physical attractiveness, gender, religion, sexual preference, favorite sports teams, accent, etc. Many of the moderates I know who support Walker do so because he's actually willing to do something. They don't care that the something isn't working, it's that he's doing something and they see the Democratic leadership in this state as being unwilling to do 'something.' If there were a Democratic candidate who came out and actively pushed for recreational marijuana and a healthcare system closer to single payer than to Obamacare, these people would likely switch from voting for Walker to voting for them.  Hell, I know of one person who supports him because they think that we need to alternate between equal years with a Democrat and a a Republican. In 2018, they are going to vote for whoever the Democrats put up, regardless of their actual quality of candidate, for the sake of balance. They are voting Republican in 2016. If a Republican somehow won in the 2018 gubernatorial election after Walker's glorious presidential campaign gets the national media to start talking about things that have gone downhill since he took over, they would vote for a Democrat until one had served for enough years to offset the Republican leadership.  I don't like Walker personally. He's pretty much polar opposite of me on the political spectrum (I was a Democratic Socialist before it was cool.) That stated, there are some things he has done I agree with. Lean Government is a very good idea, in my mind. I don't see why a Democrat would stop it and I'd have been curious to see what Burke would have done with it, but I'll give Walker & Co the credit they deserve for starting it off. He also signed the nation's first law requiring outside review of officer-involved shootings. Though I'm not a Bucks fan, I support the arena project. I'd prefer the owners put up more/all of the money. Fucking Orlando was able to completely privately finance a pro soccer stadium, so I see no reason why a sport that's supposed to be more popular in America should have any trouble doing the same. If the owners won't, though, we'd stand to lose a lot of money. Not just from the team leaving with their large salaries and businesses in Milwaukee losing on revenue, but from the potential loss of a future NHL expansion team.  Edit: Added everything past the first 8 words."

I think if I remember correctly one of the top values for people who identified as ""conservative"" is loyalty.  Loyalty trumps many other values for conservatives. Changing your mind is often viewed as being disloyal, very negative.  I'm also reminded of the Reagan administration and the Iran-Contra scandal.  Oliver North, Bud McFarlane, and others clearly broke the law. But here's the thing:  their consciences were clear.    In other words,  conservatives-- because they feel like they have a ""higher calling"" related to their Christian values (as they define ""Christian"")-- don't view transgressions by one of their own as really being ""transgressions.""  Walker has a ""higher calling,"" so whatever he's doing must be right.  So what if he's trying to protect himself by changing the open records laws?  So what if he's shifting the tax burden from the ""jobs producers"" to average people?  It must be for his ""higher calling,"" right? Right??  Yeah, right."

Since they lack a real sense of human empathy, they can't comprehend a political issue until it affects them personally. Even with all the factual evidence proving Walker's idiocy you simply could not comprehend how bad he was... until it affected you. Then you got it. Another example is how conservatives come around on the gay marriage issue ONLY when a close personal family member or friend comes out. Then they get it, the empathy kicks in when it hits so close to home. You simply could not comprehend how bad Walker was until YOU PERSONALLY were affected by his decisions."

There was nothing down or up-ticket to inspire democratic voting blocks to turn out. That's how Tammy Baldwin was elected to the Senate, and its why Russ Feingold lost in 2010. Walker was elected in 2010, 2011, and 2014, all off years for Democrats on the national level.

I think that taking an anti-union stance, in addition to costing her a lot of donor support and possibly losing her the joke of a primary she was in, would have caused a lot of liberal voters to see her as not left-of-center. Unions are typically liberals top donors. You don't really see many people calling for their donors to lose power and money, and it's not like she was going to court many business donors when she's running against Walker."
wisconsin,3cgub2,tf113,2,Wed Jul 8 17:53:07 2015 UTC,"Turnout might have been an issue, but I still think the strongly pro-union voters were also generally anti-Walker enough to show up at the polls.  In the same vein, a lot of that union money was pretty much guaranteed to her just because she was running against Walker. I mean, if you're a union leader in mid-2014 and Burke says she'll keep Act 10 but leave it at that, do you say, ""not good enough,"" close your pocketbook, and watch Walker win again and butcher the unions for another four years? They didn't have a choice other than to back whoever got the Democratic nomination."
wisconsin,3cgub2,TheHairyFart,2,Wed Jul 8 18:59:02 2015 UTC,"Pro-union voters are pro-union voters. If their choice is a guy who wants to get rid of their union or a girl who wants to get rid of their union, at least some won't make a choice. The ones who would go against Walker in that situation aren't pro-union voters, they're Democrat voters. I could be wrong, but very few people have being against unions as their #1 criteria, so I find it hard to believe that she'd see enough to offset that move.  The unions aren't going to donate to a candidate who wants to hurt them, period. It's not like there's a law that they have to donate to her. They'd just sit on their money until 2018, which probably would have been the smarter move anyway. They might give token ""lesser of two evils"" support, but they aren't about to waste all of their money electing someone who is opposed to them.  Also, if she came out as being for Act 10 after saying she was opposed to Act 10, she'd alienate more than just the unions. That's a huge flip flop, especially if the reason was as transparent as ""I want to get voters from Walker."" Walker supporters aren't going to buy that. Democrats are going to be pissed she lied to get the nomination, and her donors are going to pull out."

If anything, we milked as much time as we possibly could out of those jobs.  Not to mention the 30+ pages of paperwork needed to fill out to even apply for it.

wisconsin,3cdeq6,Abzug,6,Tue Jul 7 13:58:52 2015 UTC,"In February 2012, the MacIver Institute sued Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) because he blacked-out constituent names on a number of emails he supplied in response to their open records request. Erpenbach said at the time:   “Every single record requested by the MacIver Institute has been given to them. The MacIver Institute just isn’t happy that they did not receive all of the personally identifiable information contained in those records. As a constitutional officer I have a duty to represent the people of the 27th Senate District. People should be able to contact Legislators without fear. Contacting an office should not put you on a list to get Sports Illustrated, telemarketing calls or a push-pull call from the MacIver Institute. I have a job to do here; listening to concerns and taking action for people is that job.”   Erpenbach won in Grant County, then MacIver appealed and won  in 2013. Yes, Vos and Nygren did not speak up for him then. Erpenbach's legal bill (paid by the public) was about $170,000, plus we paid MacIver's bill, too.  I can sympathize with both positions. A citizen contacts a legislator with an opinion. Under what conditions would you like to hide the citizen's identity?   What's the real difference between J. Random citizen and, say, businessman Snidely Whiplash, and how exactly would you encode that difference in a law?   If a lawmaker says ""I have here in my hand a list of 205,000 citizens who've contacted me to shape our policies"" do you want to be able to verify that statement?   The WisGOP and their sympathizers certainly whipped up an apparatus to make public the names of recall petition signers. The database was searchable and even cross-correlated to other info. Did it have a lasting chilling effect? You bet. Thousands and thousands of people have been cowed into telling themselves they'll never sign another recall petition again, mostly because they fear for their job and their chances of being promoted or hired, because they believe a Republican appointee will check the database.  The alternative is what? You want a legislator to have the authority to decide whether to obscure the names of their contacts?  If a motion comes forward that favors payday lenders, do you want a newspaper to have the ability to track down which lobbyist pushed which legislator for that measure, and to correlate it with campaign cash?  Don't just tell me the law is bad. Show me how you'd re-write it."

That's a ~12% decrease in the state contribution (according to totals from 2014-2015 numbers). Very large chunks of the university's budget are funded by gifts and federal government, which have to be spent on very specific things. I believe faculty and other student facing services are vastly funded by tuition, fees, and the state, so cuts in the state aid directly affect the quality of education that can be offered."

Hell, I may not even be correct in calling it a classic Republican strategy, but I don't recall seeing Democrats use it much, if at all.   If you're running for office, you've got to have a pretty iron fist around what your family says to the media, or you're fucked. Either Walker doesn't, or this was absolutely intentional.

His comments reek of somebody who just hasn't taken the time to understand the issue. I get the same arguments from friends of mine very regularly. I don't blame him for being against it- a lot of people are not yet comfortable, and he's a product of his environment and will come to understand it. Meanwhile, it's not helpful to attack him for it. It's only going to make him more defensive in his opinions. I do, however, blame him for speaking out while not being entirely educated."

Sometimes I think some people have a desire to be ruled by an unchecked power.  Especially in times of fear.  Sadly, fear is pushed so hard... It's all we have. Did you watch the news at all on 7/3 and 7/4?  They were pumping the public on a 4th terrorist attack... Yet once again nothing happened. And people have already forgotten the news cast.

All the other things going on that could get reported on, good and bad, but they go right to this speculative fearmongering bullshit.  You can root a lot of the positions some people who identify as conservatives have, in a fear basis.  Fear of the ""other"" is basic tribal politics, anyway, so I'm not so shocked that preying on the primeval fear response is standard protocol. We're hard-wired to be afraid of anything we don't understand, and our brains process at stunning speeds when we're anxious, afraid, stressed.  I don't remember the research exactly, and don't have the time to look (frankly), but I read an article or paper on the frame rates, ticker speed, screen wipe speeds, looking at all the movement on screen and the tempo/patterns of speech in presenters between FOX, CNN, MSNBC, and PBS ""news"" shows, and found the patterns, speeds, colors, tickers, and all the peripheral ""noise"" on the FOX broadcast was timed in such a way that it provoked similar brain signals as a heightened anxious state in a viewer, unconsciously.

The Packers wouldn't have left (and didn't have the head of the NFL confirming it) if they didn't get a new stadium.
wisconsin,3cav4r,KEM10,4,Mon Jul 6 23:58:00 2015 UTC,"I guess the real crux of the issue is the cost vs the current budget situation.  On one hand we have the current state government cutting funding by hundreds of millions of dollars from schools, universities, parks, roads on so on that benefit the tax payers as a whole state wide.  On the other hand, the current government is willing to give out money (that they don't have, thus the cuts to everything mentioned above) to fund something that will primarily line the pockets of a select few individuals involved with a for-profit sports franchise."
wisconsin,3cav4r,LanMarkx,2,Tue Jul 7 00:59:06 2015 UTC,"A large portion of that money they are ""giving out"" though is going to be paid back by player taxes that are going to be lost if the team moves.

The issues are completely separate - if the stadium isn't approved, it isn't like the university gets to bond the money instead.  Bottom line is you should look at this issue separately - the Bucks generate revenue for the state and make a decent contingent of the state happy.   I grew up in Merrill and was a Bucks fan since I was a kid.  I had Bucks gear, bought souveniers, and watched them on TV any chance I had.  Everything I bought put money in the state's coffers.  As an adult, I buy decent tickets and go to a few games a year.  I also attend events at the Bradley Center, and would also do so at the new facility - likely more of each."

The biggest thing people don't understand is that the Bucks and other parties use prospective studies to predict economic impact, and this methodology is dubious and difficult to estimate. Real economists use retrospective studies, which look at actual outcomes and overwhelmingly show that publicly-financed stadiums have not been worth the public money.  These studies are from institutions across the political spectrum (Cato, Heartland, Brookings) and from more neutral entities (St. Louis Fed, Harvard, etc...) as well as news sites (PS Mag, Bloomberg, Salon). None of these are sponsored or published by the NBA or franchise owners, local economic development associations, or sports lobby groups, etc. Also note how many studies also reference the substitution effect as putting a massive damper on the touted economic impact of sports arenas. Every dollar spent at the Bucks doesn't get used elsewhere in our economy.  http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2000/7/coates.pdf (Says:  Methodology used in prospective impact studies (read:  Bucks & other interested parties) is faulty because it is difficult to predict the future, and uses dubious methodology (multipliers on economic impact).

In the sake of fairness, here's the pro-arena study that so many like to cite. http://www.scribd.com/doc/267115581/Arena-Impacts-Paper-by-Dr-Anthony-Pennington-Cross This is by a Marquette finance professor (sponsored by the MMAC, who is pro-arena). A great view of an ""academic"" paper that people like to claim supports the arena. Don't forget that Marquette has a huge stake in this arena as well. Any quick glance and you'll immediately notice that this paper is totally dubious and could never survive any serious academic review. I wrote better papers in undergraduate economics than this - longer ones too.  This thing is heavy on rhetoric (talks about the ancient use of arenas... OK), almost no actual statistic figures, no methodology, and is... 15 pages long. So using bunk figures (the paper literally takes the expected developments' square footages and calculates workers based off that, to say nothing of substitution effect, or the fact the figures are all not real) it projects a total of 1,422 new, permanent jobs from the arena AND ancillary development. Let's just take this on face value, although we shouldn't. At a tag of $250 million that's $175,808 of taxpayer money per estimated job ""created"". At a potential $1.1 billion, which factors in hidden costs like tax exemptions and ancillary costs that could be viewed as $773,558 per job. Either figure is an outrageous bill for a jobs program. A typical MKE news station headline about this article says ""Marquette Study says Bucks Arena is good for jobs"". Well, so is prostitution...  ...and I'm done. Hope this changes some minds."
wisconsin,3cav4r,SismoWellington,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:17:54 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting that the team moves if there's no new stadium. The studies you're linking assume all else equal, so you need to factor in the loss of $10.7 Million a year (not factoring the new player deals hitting the table in the next year that will push this figure up).  That's it. Team stays, no real economic change but there is another large, vacant lot that no one wants that is now collecting taxes as well as some one off construction for 2 years. Team leaves, no real economic change, but now the city is paying for BMO maintenance (it is public owned) and the state loses out on $10 mil a year for all the income taxes on player salaries.  Milwaukee and WI lose more by the Bucks leaving than bonding (paid back with interest) $150 mil."
wisconsin,3cav4r,KEM10,0,Tue Jul 7 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"That's misleading. The studies don't assume ""all else equal"" - they say that a stadium, regardless of financing methods, generates no net positive economic impact. The field is in consensus:  Building a sports arena does not provide economic benefit, regardless of financing. I know you do agree with that.  The idea that the loss of tax revenue is so great with the Bucks leaving, is wrong in so many ways. Yes, the tax on Bucks players' salary will be lost. But the Bradley Center will still function and host other events, as well as Marquette and the Admirals. There is also a case to make that the Bradley Center has experienced deferred maintenance due to a new arena being on the horizon. That, and the fact that it will be used less without the Bucks, brings the potential maintenance cost down ($16.9 million immediately says state rep, far, far less than $10.7 million annually). That's if taxpayers are even legally on the hook for maintenance, which has been challenged.  Regardless, the Bradley Center's only 30 years old, after all - it's not crumbling. Don't forget, arenas are largely open spaces with cheap metal bleachers and concrete. And if it has to be torn down for the new arena, that's yet another cost.  But the big picture is that in addition to upfront tax ($404 million), exemptions (hundreds of millions lost on property tax where practice facilities, restaurants, bars, shops, hotels, and apartments may go), free land (sold for $1) and the cost of increased public services (millions for roads, utilities, police, street maintenance, etc.), the total bill completely eclipses whatever minor (potential) maintenance costs are associated with the Bradley Center and lost player revenue.  That vacant in Park East land isn't forever vacant, either. With that much public money being given away to the Bucks, any half-competent real estate developer would be able to successfully build in Park East. Development is going up across the city, with over a thousand apartments in the next few years coming on-market. The city and state don't need to plunk down hundreds of millions and exempt hundreds of millions more in order to force development. That land is in a prime location (look at the Moderne, or aLoft) and could easily become filled with tax-paying development in the next 5-15 years. Even smaller subsidies and exemptions could kick that area into action, although the looming arena deal has certainly helped to keep that land vacant.

That Park East land has been vacant for 15 years and the list price ($8.8 mil) isn't even half of what that competent developer will have to pay to remove the old support structures (estimated $3.1 mil) and shift the sewer lines (estimated $6 mil). That same competent developer will go somewhere else because that land is not worth $20 million before they can even start construction.   Conveniently, here's an article written today (!) addressing your points:   This article is bad. Their first point ""Current income tax paid by players would be lost"" is true. With the players not here, the income taxes from paying the players are gone. They're attempting to play a shell game by talking about spending by the public on other entertainment.

I could be far off on that theory but here's why I don't support it:  why are we tax payers always asked to foot the bill, or big parts of it, or the team or business will leave?  Damn the economic impact.  I'm tired of being held hostage.  I believe Jerry Jones built Dallas Stadium without taxpayer support.  Why can't anyone else?"

Why would they try to push this?  If they're bold enough to try to push this through on a federal holiday... What hope do we have for this state?
wisconsin,3c52jg,nicolauz,6,Sun Jul 5 16:35:19 2015 UTC,"Who do you think that 'shadow' person was that brought this up?   If it wasn't Darling and/or Nygren themselves then they certainly know who and so are colluding with them to keep their name in the shadows.  As I mentioned in a comment on the other related story, Gordon Hintz, Democratic member of the JFC, said that the GOP members of the committee had made it clear that Walker had signed off on measure 999 beforehand and Jon Erpenbach confirms (although not being on the JFC it's unclear if he's getting that from Hintz, or other JFC Dems, or some other source).  That doesn't mean that Walker proposed it, but it does mean that Walker is at least AOK with it.   Why would they try to push this?   There are three conceivable reasons: either as is claimed in the press release, they want to protect constituents from having their names show up in Open Records requests, or they are fed up with the amount of time and trouble it takes to satisfy open records requests, or they have something to hide.  The first doesn't make any add up since there were no public hearings at which there could be any public call for this to happen.  The second, we have heard grumbles about it in the past from election officials, but again it doesn't really add up because if the revenue from Open Records requests doesn't cover the actual costs of satisfying them, bumping the per-page price until it does would make far more sense than turning Wisconsin government into a black box.  The thing I find curious is that Walker added his name to this press release (Laurel Patrick is his gubernatorial press secretary).  He has no direct connection to the introduction of legislation outside of the Executive Budget proposal and Special Sessions, neither of which is the case here.  He could have kept his hands publicly clean (at least for now) by instead independently issuing a veto threat on the matter, which might indicate that he won't be able to credibly deny Hintz's report.  There's been the suggestion that Walker wants this in order to avoid having his dirty laundry aired while he's on the Presidential trail.  We don't know this for sure, but it's not something he's denied and by buddy-buddy joint press releasing with those who indubitably do know who introduced it, raises an exceedingly strong and reasonable suspicion that this is indeed the case (also see: Open Records requests regarding his precise role in this currently flying towards his office).  The one thing I don't think it is is a smokescreen to hide some of the other nauseating items in the motion (such as prohibiting Dane County from making Enbridge meet certain insurance requirements for running oil through their pipeline there and turning the ""living wage"" statutes into ""minimum wage"" ones so that the DWD doesn't have to justify $7.25/hr as being enough to live on).  If you're building a fire to make a smokescreen with, you burn your political opponents' mores in order to produce the headlines about their reactions, not those of your own supporters.   If they're bold enough to try to push this through on a federal holiday... What hope do we have for this state?   The burying of it in an omnibus motion at 9pm the Thursday before a holiday weekend so as to ensure that it misses reporters' deadlines for Friday papers and so goes unread by the population on the Saturday is the least-bold, most-cowardly move possible in legislative moves.  The hope on this policy at least is that there was enormous pushback across the board here: from the Republican AG, from a Republican Senator, from editorial boards across the state regardless of their political leaning, to citizens for whom normally the WisGOP can do no wrong (at least by having a look at various comment sections that would appear to be the case)."
wisconsin,3c52jg,toasters_are_great,4,Sun Jul 5 20:29:45 2015 UTC,"they want to protect constituents from having their names show up in Open Records requests,    Except the WisGOP liked that when it came to learning the names of those who opposed Act 10.  I can imagine an alternative version of the Motion 999 language that would've simply given them the ability to black-out all personal and identifying information about a constituent - if that was what they wanted to protect. I think they wanted to obscure the entire deliberative process.   or they are fed up with the amount of time and trouble it takes to satisfy open records requests,    This is a common complaint. On one hand I can understand that it's a pain in the neck, moreso for the small offices. If you were a farmer who volunteered to be appointed to the county drainage committee as a representative of the Town of Bumblefritz, you believe you're there to help them with drainage issues. When someone asks to see your emails discussing an issue, you feel that task is not the reason you volunteered. It's the same up the hierarchy, but in larger organizations, there are other records custodians and staff who can help with the request.   People in government tend to forget that complying with records requests is just as much a part of their job description as their core competency. You want to manage the wastewater treatment plant, but you still need to fulfill open records requests made by a citizen or the newspaper. This complaint resonates with your superiors and often with the public, though. Your boss doesn't want you to be distracted from your job tasks, and your supporters among the public don't want to think you're being overloaded with non-core tasks.    or they have something to hide.   No dramatic conspiracy is necessary. Many politicians want it both ways. They want the press to show up to report/stenograph when they call a press conference about a positive or self-promoting topic. They don't want the press writing anything negative about what they're doing. They don't want their opposition to leverage any details that make them look bad.   because if the revenue from Open Records requests doesn't cover the actual costs of satisfying them, bumping the per-page price until it does would make far more sense than turning Wisconsin government into a black box.   Yes, they can charge to locate a record. You can ask to simply inspect records, which can save you the cost of copying. Here's the WisFOIC guide to costs.  I can see the other side, though. If a government department hired someone to do task X full-time, but later decides that employee also needs to spend time performing the search to fulfill open records requests, they feel like that employee has had time taken away from task X, even if there's some pro-forma cost-recovery happening. If a news event drives a dramatic increase in open records requests, how can a small department handle the rush?"

Here are some previous self posts on the matter.  #1  #2  #3  These search results also help, as might search results for people requesting that political posts go to /r/WisconsinPolitics.  This post, while it doesn't ask the same question you asked, it is very recent and has several posts that get to what you're asking.  You could probably also open up nearly any post that gets over 50 replies and see the topic digressing into reasoning behind the general Walker hate. If you expand any comments that are below the downvote threshold, you'll probably see the reasoning from the people who like him.  The shortest answer is that he's a polarizing figure. When people are polarized, they tend to take to the polar opinions of hate or love easily. I made a post a week ago about word frequency on state subreddits. Two state subreddits had words other than the state's name in the #1 spot (Wisconsin with Walker and California with Water.) It's not just that he's a governor and state subreddits are more political than normal subreddits, it's that he's so damn polarizing.  Edit: formatting and a few more links."

And that’s what we have in this instance, an extreme and egregious attempt to provide cover for those who would work against the public interest, either illegally or unethically.  ....  At the end of the day, the Republican Party of Wisconsin looks corrupt. That’s the perception and maybe it’s the reality. Coupled with crony sleaze over at the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, well, there’s something smelling awfully rotten down in Madison.   Democrats, well informed moderates, and liberals were exposing the corruption in the party during Walker's first term.  If it were Democrats destroying redistricting documents, Republicans would have been flipping a shit.  Along with that, we had AT&T's attack on Wiscnet to give more money to itself thereby having worse services and higher costs, the attempted insertion of no-bid contract sales of power facilities owned in the state in the original budget repair bill, voter suppression masqueraded as voter ID, etc.  Better late than never I suppose.    Circa 2012:  The Lakeland Times endorses Scott Walker for governor   We do not abhor recalls per se. When an elected official is proven guilty of criminal or ethical violations, or of gross malfeasance on the job, the voters should have a way to remove that official. But, by the same token, those officials should be immune to blatantly political attempts to overturn elections because of policy disagreements.  And that is exactly what we have here: Policy disagreements.  So the very reason for the recall has long ago vaporized, and with it so should have the recall. But determined union bosses, angry that their power and privilege had been called out, carried on. It has been an ongoing, in-your-face confrontation with the people of Wisconsin.   They didn't get it then and whitewashed him.  Maybe now they can look back on that and understand it was a lot more than simply ""policy disagreements"".  I could use that same phrase now and sweep what they're doing under the rug too.   ....  That's because, as Mr. Walker likes to say, Wisconsin is open for business again. Taxes are lower, and regulations are fewer, and there is a sense that the private sector can actually operate profitably again.   Congrats on carrying water for Walker, Lakeland Times.

From my experience, the Illinois drivers that come up from Chicago are used to more aggressive driving because that's how it is there. However, they are better about staying in the right lane and using the left to pass, Wisconsinites are crap at that (even though I'm pretty sure it is the law).   As far as Illinois drivers being worse drivers here, I'd say that's probably because they don't drive here as much. Whenever you are in a new place you're not going to be as good of a driver as you would be in places you're familiar with. We have different signs and ramps that can confuse visitors.  Also, I recommend driving on I-94 when the Cubs are playing in Milwaukee, you'll see state troopers pulling over cars with Illinois plates every couple of miles.  *edit: I-94, not I-90"

I've been living in WI for 15 yrs now. From what I've observed the animosity is all on Wisconsin's side. Illinois doesn't hate WI. Sure the Bears fans don't like the Packers fans, but other than that Illinois people tend to just think WI is a nice place to go on vacation that has good cheese. That's what I think makes WI folks not like IL folks: they come up here on vacation and act like annoying tourists. Sure WI wants all that tourism income, but would prefer if it didn't include loud, fast driving, inconsiderate tourists. I've also noticed that when WI people say they don't like IL people, they actually mean they don't like people from the Chicago-land area. I'm from downstate IL and it's not that different than the rural areas here, just flatter and with less bars. Downstate IL also doesn't really like Chicago-land area people.   There's also the coded racist language that I've encountered of not liking ""people from Chicago"" to mean not liking black people. The non-racists tend to say they don't like Illinois and call people FIBs. The racists ones tend to complain about it's all those ""people from Chicago"" moving here making things bad and causing trouble."

I've also spent enough time at Devil's Lake to know that Madison area residents can be just as shitty.

You spectate the officials and the refs for more time than the actual athletes. It's a bunch of bullshit.""

It's all rigged and I suspect they do it to distract the masses from the plight of the poor.""

I can't see the Clinton war machine letting him gain enough ground to be nominated.  For the past few years the ground work has been put in place to have her the next President."
wisconsin,3btqc6,dnalur,16,Thu Jul 2 13:28:23 2015 UTC,"I do.  There are a lot of people out there who haven't been voting because they don't see anything worthwhile in it.  We see it here, too - candidates are both the same, all politicians are the same, there's no difference between the corporate candidates.  We argue about the nuances, but when it comes down to it, that doesn't get people into the booths to cast a ballot.  That empowers the status quo, when people don't go vote.  ""Populist"" is thrown around like a derogatory.  It makes it sound like there's nothing of substance, that Sanders is telling people just what they want to hear.  Discredits the guy in a single word.  Yeah, what he's saying is popular - but because this is what people think and what people want to see change.  He's got a better chance than Clinton in the general election - I know registered Republicans who are tired of the shit Walker, Cruz, McConnell, Jindal, Christie, and the rest of them have been pulling, and who have enough brains to see how Rand Paul is just another opportunist.  They've raised a few eyebrows at Sanders, because there are still Progressive Republicans out there who have been utterly marginalized by their own crazy train of a party, and Sanders is talking sense while the nutjobs wail away."
wisconsin,3btqc6,no_soul_ginger,3,Thu Jul 2 14:20:42 2015 UTC,"Your last paragraph is purely wishful thinking. With the absolute detestation even moderate republicans have for the ACA and Dodd-Frank, it's laughable to think they would vote for someone who calls for fully socialized medicine and the break up and further regulation of all big banks. There is little in Bernie's platform that would appeal to people even slightly right of center. And I say this as someone on the far left."
wisconsin,3btqc6,JaseFace,12,Thu Jul 2 15:09:11 2015 UTC,"You're looking at this as a purely binary thing.  It isn't.  There are progressives out there who are also Republicans.  While the ultra-conservative and neo-conservative rhetoric has taken over the GOP, there are some boomer-age Republicans who see universal medicine and banking regulation as both prudent and long-term fiscally responsible things to do.  They also don't like seeing trillions spent on Defense, when roads/bridges are crumbling.  They've been shushed into a corner by fear-mongering and badgering, Gadsen-flag waving, small-L-libertarians-come-lately, and are more likely to sit out the next election because they wanted Hillary to have a spine in the 90's, and can't in good conscience hold their noses and vote for the R anymore.  The list of pros and cons balanced out in 2012, and what the GOP's done since Romney lost is ailenating these folks, just like ""Barrett II: DPW Fails Harder"" did to a lot of liberal and progressive Democrats in Wisconsin.  Second thing: For Liberals, Progressives, Socialists, and even main-stream Democrats, there is nothing in the bag.  We've seen the Democrat party shoot itself in the foot, time and time again with the smug sense that ""Truth will out!"" and dismissing the opposition as smarmy, unintelligent, dirty, and even crazy - only to have stupid corrupt people blow past and win entire branches of governments.  We've been doing the easy thing - the obvious candidate, the ""can't let a Republican in"" bullshit for too long, and we've not been doing the hard work of backing and supporting a candidate who really does believe, and is the part.  Carter needed 2 terms.  Clinton got a bump from Bush I raising taxes.  Obama swept in on a wave of Bush II rejection - but Obama and the DFL completely underestimated how confrontation-ally opposed to everything the GOP would be.  I don't expect that mistake again, but a Sanders in the general election will insure it doesn't happen again."
wisconsin,3btqc6,no_soul_ginger,14,Thu Jul 2 16:01:33 2015 UTC,"Well, it wouldn't be the first time that a groundswell internet candidate unseated Hillary...  And I gotta admit, the desperation across the media gives me a bit of hope.  They're still sticking to the narrative that this crazy old man can't possibly win, even when that ""crazy old man"" (read: ""Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee,  the longest serving independent member of Congress in American history who won his last reelection with 71% of the vote"") is pulling in more people than any other presidential candidate in the field.  Yeah, I take his chances pretty seriously."
wisconsin,3btqc6,MSACCESS4EVA,8,Thu Jul 2 14:49:12 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say, because it's so early. Clinton's in the lead, but then everybody knows who she is.  The rally in Madison was larger than any rally candidates have had so far this cycle. So I'd like to think that's a sign that he has a chance."
wisconsin,3btqc6,Matt5327,7,Thu Jul 2 14:26:23 2015 UTC,"I see it as Sanders playing politics already. Having a rally in Madison is a good optics move for his candidacy. Progressive Madison will always turn out in huge numbers. He choose a place that he knew would pack it in and make for a extremely good news cycle for the weekend talk shows, especially right as Walker wants to announce.  I'm not saying what he did was wrong. Exact opposite, brilliant move."
wisconsin,3btqc6,dnalur,8,Thu Jul 2 14:39:00 2015 UTC,"The best part is, it wasn't just people from Progressive Madison. It was people from Progressive Wisconsin and Progressive Midwest. Surely a good chunk of the crowd was from Madison, but this article about the rally cites people driving from Appleton (northeast of Madison), Milwaukee, Dixon (north-central Illinois), and Chicago.  Edit: forgot I was in /r/wisconsin. Sorry for describing where Appleton is :)"

wisconsin,3btqc6,Matt5327,7,Thu Jul 2 20:41:00 2015 UTC,"The hype around Sanders is similar to what it was around Obama in '08. I remember nobody thought Obama had a chance against Hilary, to the point that Limbaugh was telling his listeners to vote for Obama to sow discontent among the Dems.  I'm not saying he'll win, but you can't dismiss him at this point. When all is said and done, assuming no major gaffs or surprises, I'd expect Clinton and Sanders to be within 5 points."
wisconsin,3btqc6,jayme0227,16,Thu Jul 2 15:05:12 2015 UTC,"Chances of getting the nomination? Probably slim.   But candidates that don't win help push the direction of policy all the time.  4 years ago the GOP candidates were pushed right during the primary by fighting to win the ""Tea Party"" vote. There are many people hoping that Bernie can help drive the Democratic party away from Hillary's Hawk policies. The biggest fear right now for the Clinton Campaign should be being forced into a debate with a candidate that's more Left leaning and vocal about it: She has nothing to gain and everything to lose by looking bad.   The democratic party also needs the people Bernie's energizing: If Hillary blows off his contingent her chances in the General Election are worse.  8 years ago at the beginning of the campaign nobody thought a Junior Senator named Barack Obama had a chance against the Hillary machine, but he did."
wisconsin,3btqc6,LongUsername,6,Thu Jul 2 13:50:24 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your response, a few things I differ in observations. In my eyes, four years ago the GOP put a centralist candidate out and I knew instantly Romney was going to get slaughtered. Four years before that they put a ""maverick"" out there and once he won the nomination he got slaughtered by the media. Palin didn't help matters at all with that. When O got in the race I knew Clinton was in trouble, he hit all the right buttons for a nomination.  I just see a media that is pushing for a Bush vs Clinton election because it will make for news they want.   I wish it was a hard core conservative vs. a progressive leftist and have a real debate on the direction of policies. It won't happen. The establishment likes how things are going.  Walker will be a extremely conservative candidate but I highly doubt they will let him get the nomination. VP slot maybe, to cater to that far right wing. Same for Clinton, I can see her somehow having Warren or Sanders as a VP choice to cater to the far left."
wisconsin,3btqc6,dnalur,7,Thu Jul 2 14:32:42 2015 UTC,"McCain was centrist, but ended up trying to court the far right and it bit him in the ass.  His selection of Palin to try to appeal to the right and women vote backfired as she proved herself unelectable at a national level. I was looking at potentially voting for McCain until Palin opened her mouth and McCain started pandering to the base.  He's been out there anti-big money and anti-torture more than almost any other candidate that was there. He voted against the Bush Tax Cuts and has supported Climate Change limiting Cap & Trade legislation.  He had a Pro-immigration policy and a reputation for working cross-party to get things done.  He was someone who probably would have made a good, unifying president and gotten a lot of things done."

It was probably based on the 9,500 RSVPs the Sanders campaign reported. Probably would have been larger if school was in session. I walked around State Street afterwards and the folks out there were even talking about it.  *edit: formatting issues, I don't post often"
wisconsin,3btqc6,JLeroyII,8,Thu Jul 2 06:50:00 2015 UTC,"The Chicago Tribune notes that the venue was filled, and its capacity 10,000.  It's particularly interesting because if a Vermont socialist can draw 10,000+, when Walker inevitably violates his pre-election promise he has to draw at least that many to any rallies he has in Wisconsin in order to avoid grave embarrassment.

He is hoping for a VP nod or a cabinet seat should someone else win.   This is why Walker won't get the GOP nomination:   He didn't graduate college. The last president without a college degree was Harry Truman. This was 66 years ago. He doesn't have a full head of hair. The last bald president was Eisenhower (51 years ago).  Republican canidates must have that side part hair that does not move in the wind. He won't even win Wisconsin. If you can't win your own home state they won't waste a nomination on you.  Paul Ryan couldn't deliver Wisconsin and he was the VP in the last election. He has yet to be tested in an election against a real candidate.  The WI democratic Gov. candidates were weak, if not terrible. Now he has to get through a murderers row of GOP candidates (Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush) and then run against Hillary Clinton, yeah sorry folks it's going to be Hillary.  The GOP candidates will shred him for his lack of education and it will be all over.  He has 0 charisma. Charisma = Electability.  If you lack Charisma you better have a lot of name recognition and he has neither.  He's more boring then Mitt Romney.  He has out spent his opponents during elections.  This wont happen against Hillary.  She has Billionaires too.   All that being said The Koch Brothers seem to like him and have 120 billion dollars to spend forcing him down America's throats.

wisconsin,3brkit,jaywhoo,4,Wed Jul 1 22:45:54 2015 UTC,"I think we should strive to have a level of representation on par with what was intended when our nation's government was being figured out.  It's completely absurd that one person speaks for millions of constituents.  How can you represent your electorate when your electorate numbers that high?  Currently, it's about who has enough money to get real consideration.  How often does Ron Johnson sit down with the poor, as compared to those that can afford to buy a one-on-one?  Who's interests is he serving when he's literally dependant on the wealthy to afford his campaign?  People think it's nutso to have a congress that numbers in the thousands.  ""Nothing would get done!""  As compared to what we have now?!  How easy would it be for two political parties to hold the entire nation hostage if they had thousands of races to deal with?  Bet your ass you wouldn't get a form letter if your constituents numbered 10,000 or less.  Good luck gerrymandering 300 districts in every state to try to make your positions undefeatable.  Would it make things more complicated?  Absolutely.  But locking our representatives to 435 means they all but ensure that third parties are doomed to fail without a miracle.  It's no coincidence that it's been the Elephant and Donkey show since they locked our representatives at the beginning of the 20th century.  If our representatives don't have the time to at least draft a personal reply (even if they have an aide do it) then they're representing too many fucking people."
wisconsin,3brkit,angrydeuce,0,Wed Jul 1 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"I guess the best response is not one of my personal experience, rather one from one of the founding fathers himself, James Madison:   In the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the republic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number, in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that, however large it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude. Hence, the number of representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of the two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small republic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit characters be not less in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice...It must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a mean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie. By enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the representatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances and lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly attached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and national objects. The federal Constitution forms a happy combination in this respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the national, the local and particular to the State legislatures.   James Madison, The Federalist #10, P17-19  I guess what it comes down to is that you feel that your Senator Represents too many people. The best solution to something like this is to, instead of contacting your senator, contact your Member of Congress when it comes to national issues, or your State Representatives when it comes to state issues. These offices tend to be much more responsive, as they are much more closely tied to you, the constituent.  I hope I've clarified the situation to you and given some remedies! If not, feel free to let me know!"
wisconsin,3brkit,jaywhoo,3,Wed Jul 1 23:46:42 2015 UTC,"One could weigh the pros and cons of too large or too small a governing body (albeit probably without the eloquence of Mr. Madison) until the cows come home, but at the end of the day, I'd say it's worth a shot.  Senator Johnson is of course a member of a body that was created in order to be a check on the will of the masses.  But the will of the masses isn't a consideration anymore, either, because the masses aren't being represented in our House of Representatives any more than the Senate.  Simple arithmetic reveals that our congressmen represent over 735,000 people.  Of course that's not an accurate picture, as some represent much more, and some represent much less, but still, it's appalling that we actually consider that ""representative"" at all.  It's ludicrous to even pretend that all those people are being represented, or even a fraction of them.  It's even more appalling that the governing body is designed to govern itself in these matters.  How many sitting representatives would ever vote to uncap that figure and make the representation more sanely proportional again?  Might as well ask them to vote themselves out of existence, or vote to cut their own pay.  I get just as many form letters from my Representatives as I do my Senators.  The last time I got a personal response was from Lisa Subeck, of the Wisconsin Assembly.  Pretty much decides that race for me, as even her opponent sent me a form letter.  Our state reps can't even even find the time to interact one on one with their constituents, let alone our Federal ones.  It's not a problem limited to our country, or our time, but goddamnit, if we can put a man on the moon, you'd think we could figure out how to ensure that the voices of the people are heard without said people waving 5 figure checks in the air."

TPP elevates corporations and corporate profits to and above the level of governments. TPP lets corporations sue governments for laws and regulations that cause them to be less profitable. Enabling tobacco companies to sue governments because anti-smoking campaigns limit profits has nothing to do with trade. Enabling corporations to sue states that try to regulate fracking has nothing to do with trade.   Assuming this is true, I don't think corporations should have the right to sue the government for lossed profits.

I think people on both sides of the aisle will have trouble with this.”      But the limited use of trade tribunals, critics argue, is because companies in those countries do not have the size, legal budgets and market power to come after governments in the United States. The Trans-Pacific Partnership could change all that, they say. The agreement would expand that authority to investors in countries as wealthy as Japan and Australia, with sophisticated companies deeply invested in the United States.  ...  One 1999 case gives ammunition to both sides of the debate. Back then, California banned the chemical MTBE from the state’s gasoline, citing the damage it was doing to its water supply. The Canadian company Methanex Corporation sued for $970 million under Nafta, claiming damages on future profits. The case stretched to 2005, when the tribunal finally dismissed all claims.  ...  More than 18,000 companies based in the United States would gain new powers to go after the other 11 countries in the accord.   Source  From the article in the previous post:  One thing that should be totally obvious, however, is that it’s off-point and insulting to offer an off-the-shelf lecture on how trade is good because of comparative advantage, and protectionists are dumb. For this is not a trade agreement. It’s about intellectual property and dispute settlement; the big beneficiaries are likely to be pharmaceutical companies and firms that want to sue governments.  --Paul Krugman"

(Or for that matter advocate getting rid of the Stars and Stripes on the basis that as a religious symbol it has no place in government).

Civil rights is not a religious doctrine and is certainly not unique to Christianity. Who is to say that all the soldiers fighting for equal rights of African Americans aren't the same soldiers fighting for equal rights of homosexuals? Why are Christians feeling so targeted by the ruling? I cannot think of one way that this affects Christians. The Christian church is not being forced to change their beliefs in any way. Section 1 of the 14th Amendment reads:    Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

wisconsin,3br5h2,mnpilot,8,Wed Jul 1 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"It wasn't fought over civil rights, it just so happened that it was a byproduct of our war strategy.  The reason we fought the south was to preserve the union.  The Emancipation Proclamation was purely a political and strategic move. The confederacy had an economy based on slave labor; what better way to defeat an enemy than to crush their economy?  If keeping slaves meant preserving the Union, Lincoln would have most likely never freed them."
wisconsin,3br5h2,skoopydoo,9,Wed Jul 1 14:50:53 2015 UTC,"This is fairly accurate, from a northern/union perspective. At the onset, Lincoln was intent on preserving the union (with or without slavery) and emancipation came relatively late, 3 1/2 years into the war. Did he do the right thing: yes. Was it initially his primary motive: no.   However, the reason southern states seceded in the first place is fairly clear--and it had everything to do with southern states preserving/protecting their rights to continue to own slaves (as it was the foundation of their agrarian economy, as compared to the more industrialized north). The documents of and surrounding the move to secede are very clear about this. Were they doing the wrong thing in seeking to perpetuate human beings owning each other: yes. Was that their initial goal: yes."
wisconsin,3br5h2,mudbat,5,Wed Jul 1 15:45:07 2015 UTC,"it had everything to do with southern states preserving/protecting their rights to continue to own slaves   I know this was a closely involved issue, but the trigger for secession was Lincoln's election itself. It also had less to do with the continued ownership system of slaves and the expansion of slavery to new states and territories. The southern states seceded because it became clear that the political system could control them without them having any say. Lincoln wasn't even on the 1860 ballot in many southern states, and he only got 39% of the popular vote. The fact that the North could elect him anyway left the South completely neutered politically. Lincoln's refusal to acknowledge certain state rights arguments (like secession rights and the expansion of slavery into new states) was what precipitated the Civil War.  If Stephen Douglas had been elected in 1860, we might not've had the civil war for decades, if at all."

wisconsin,3bra4d,belandil,0,Wed Jul 1 14:47:50 2015 UTC,"Finally, some sanity from Republicans.   Stop starting megaprojects.  Finish those in progress. Focus on maintaining existing roads.  Wisconsin winters take a heavy toll on roads, and it's not cheap to maintain them.  Note that fewer roads mean less maintenance as well! Increase gas tax to balance the transportation fund.  Apparently transportation is special enough to get its own untouchable fund.  It should be funded separately then."
wisconsin,3bra4d,koolaidman93,5,Wed Jul 1 17:45:08 2015 UTC,"These are maintaining existing roads.  No one is building new highways.  The fact that the majority of the roads are 40 to 50 years old and need upgrading and work to bring them up to today's standards.  Can't keep kicking the bucket down the road and expect them to fix themselves.    These ""Megaprojects"" are to fix congestion issues and safety.  The zoo was falling apart.  You can't just put a bandaid on it like they have done in the past.  These projects finally caught up with our lack of planning and refusal to pay for infrastructure."
wisconsin,3bra4d,belandil,3,Wed Jul 1 18:09:53 2015 UTC,"Side note: remember when the Zoo Interchange actually ""fell apart""?   It was determined that the ramp from South 41 to East 94 was structurally unsound, and that no vehicles would be allowed to drive on it. They made the decision to rebuild that particular ramp...in one week. They did it, but if I remember properly, that bridge was a patch; it was only supposed to last 10 years at most because, well, they built it in a week."
wisconsin,3bra4d,belandil,2,Wed Jul 1 19:02:03 2015 UTC,"Perhaps not as many entirely new highways, but there are several projects to add lanes to existing interstates, at significant cost:   $850 million for rebuilding and going from six lanes to eight on the 3.5-mile section of I-94 between 16th and 70th streets in Milwaukee. $715 million to extend from four to six lanes the 45 miles of I-39/90 from the Illinois state line to the US 12/18, reconstruct interchanges, and make the interstate eight lanes near Janesville.  270 lane miles to be constructed.  70% of the project to be paid for by the state.   Fewer lanes means less maintenance cost, from things like snow removal and salting to eventual resurfacing in a few decades.  But like a McMansion purchased prior to 2007, you bought it, and even if your revenue goes down, you still have to pay to maintain it.  See Buffalo, NY.  You also have to question the wisdom of making it easier to drive long distances.  People move even farther away from cities, exacerbating white flight (notice how low diversity is in most suburbs) and lowering revenue for cities, harming their schools, police departments, etc.  Because of induced demand, lower congestion following construction probably won't last.  Suburban streets are built up.  If population doesn't increase much, there are then more lane miles to maintain with a roughly flat budget."
wisconsin,3bra4d,Lahaim,5,Wed Jul 1 18:56:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, because four lanes doesn't cut it today.  We cringe like IL people coming to our state for tourism.  The amount of commerical and leisure traffic means we need to increase the number lanes.  This has nothing to do with ""white flight"" which is bullshit to begin with as that isn't happening anymore.  You do have people returning to the city, but just not Milwaukee.  Why?  Because there is nothing of value downtown.  Look at other major metro areas, there is a steady stream of people returning to downtown areas.    But that isn't for everyone.  I don't want to live in a downtown area of a metro area.  That isn't me or a bunch of other people.  If I was single and rode a turn of the century bicycle, I could dig a downtown.  But I am not, I have a family, I want a yard and I want my boat in my garage.  I also don't want to look for a parking space every night.  If you love that lifestyle, go for it.    But, upgrading the roads also means making them last longer.  Newer materials and design means they have less reconstruction cost.  Concrete lasts many years more than asphalt.  And the new roads are being built better.  Maybe if we spent more on infrastructure than giving old white folks tax breaks, we could have better roads and mass transportation"

That offered free taxi rides to and from the DMV. There were only like 20 rides set up, or some rediculously low number. If you give people an opportunity like that and they refuse it, then go ahead and enact it.   But I fear that this bus would drive all over Timbuktu and nobody would care to sit by it and fill out their paperwork anyways, and it would be a much more money put into giving people an opportunity they wouldn't otherwise use.  I like it though. Good thinking."
wisconsin,3bndc5,BrewCrewKevin,4,Tue Jun 30 21:29:30 2015 UTC,"I see two potential issues:   There's no way they'd have enough vehicles/personnel to cover all the places that need to be covered (this would be highly dependent on funding). As a result, they'd probably spend more time in areas with a higher population density, which would be criticized as targeting Democratic voters. You'd probably have people show up without the proper documentation and end up frustrated with the process.   If a mobile registration / voter ID system were adopted, I'd hope that those running it would recognize the need to saturate the areas they're planning to visit with information (when, where, what you need to bring) prior to showing up. Education may be as important as convenience for this to be effective.  Edit: They could flood the state with these mobile DMVs, but at the end of the day voter ID is still an extra hurdle (particularly for the poor and elderly) over a system that worked just fine for years."
wisconsin,3bndc5,toasters_are_great,6,Tue Jun 30 22:53:18 2015 UTC,"Also the timing is important, so as not to overlap the opening times of DMVs that already exist.  Take the tax return database, take the registered voter database, school enrollment databases of 17-18 year olds, subtract out the matches with the DMV driving license and photo ID  databases, and mail everyone who's left who lives in the vicinity of a mobile DMV appearance."
wisconsin,3bndc5,KEM10,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:35:20 2015 UTC,You want the state to match up 4 different databases that don't already talk to each other in order to track potential voters w/o an ID?  If this process was started now I doubt it would be ready by the election.
wisconsin,3bndc5,toasters_are_great,3,Wed Jul 1 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"You don't need them to talk to each other to dump the names & addresses from each.  That's either trivial, or the schema designer needs to be fired and then someone who actually knows what they're doing needs a few minutes to work out the query to retrieve them.  You don't need it to be done in real time since tax return, voter and school enrollment databases are almost completely static at certain times of the year, and if someone pops up on the DMV database in the meantime then all that's lost is a postcard and mailing costs.  Matching names and addresses between databases was a big component of my last job.  Given the same (in-house) software, for the size of these databases it'd take no more than a few hours on a modern desktop, plus perhaps an hour or two inspecting the results to see what tolerances ought to be used to decide that rows match.  Some of the work has already been done by the expert witnesses in the various 2011 Act 23 (ID-for-voting) court cases. e.g. Leland Beatty (see Appendix A on page 72) used a primitive matching approach (not even going as far as to evaluate Levenshtein distances) which was broad enough to make the plaintiffs' point.  Sure, spend a bit of time finding appropriate people to get it done, but it's not some elusive unsolved computer science problem, it's a matter of application of resources and services that already exist.  Unless your point is that the state is incompetent to do this."

It is a part of my job right now (as well as finding duplicates from the last guy who use to do this). The general inconsistencies among names, how they're recorded (one text field, 3 fields for first/MI/last, inclusion of salutation, character limits), how they're exported (god damn trailing spaces), and the different addresses in the databases (I updated my driver's license address only because it was expiring, I don't know a single person who has done it because they've moved) will make it a shit show.  And the ""have never talked to one another"" was more for not having an already designated ID matching field, table, or pointer between the systems.   Unless your point is that the state is incompetent to do this.   This one. I've been an IT contractor for the state (UW during their PeopleSoft update), they hired a firm who paid a second firm that picked me up because scope creep and the unwillingness of current employees to learn the new system in order to do do support+training calls instead of just fixing it."

At least, that's my charitable interpretation...  But the databases I'm talking about here are ones for which any first/middle/last/salutation field inconsistencies have already been figured out by experts in Act 23 cases, we know it can be done pretty easily because it already has been.   And the ""have never talked to one another"" was more for not having an already designated ID matching field, table, or pointer between the systems.   Voter registration collects driver's license/photo ID numbers though, although I'm guessing that particularly old registrations might not include such information and it's probably prone to typos.  But names, birthdates and counties/zipcodes together can make for a pretty good candidate PK regardless, and the point here is to find the already-IDed to eliminate them from being reminded so if a match fails for want of aberrant formatting or a typo then all that happens is a redundant mailer goes out."

Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know, I've tried to deal with them...  There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious beliefs. There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than Jesus Christ, or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being. But like any powerful weapon, the use of God's name on one's behalf should be used sparingly. The religious factions that are growing throughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom. They are trying to force government leaders into following their position 100 percent. If you disagree with these religious groups on a particular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss of money or votes or both. I'm frankly sick and tired of the political preachers across this country telling me as a citizen that if I want to be a moral person, I must believe in 'A,' 'B,' 'C,' and 'D.' Just who do they think they are? And from where do they presume to claim the right to dictate their moral beliefs to me? And I am even more angry as a legislator who must endure the threats of every religious group who thinks it has some God-granted right to control my vote on every roll call in the Senate. I am warning them today: I will fight them every step of the way if they try to dictate their moral convictions to all Americans in the name of 'conservatism.'"" - Barry Goldwater  WaPo article on him"
wisconsin,3bmsw6,mst3kcrow,4,Wed Jul 1 01:53:03 2015 UTC,"As a conservative, I agree. The republican party is in shambles right now.  I was talking about the gay marriage ruling with a very conservative friend of mine though, and he brought up an interesting point. It seemed he was confusing religion with business, and I wasn't educated enough to clear it up.  He was against  the ruling. When I asked why, he said he feared that the Catholic church (or most christian faiths for that matter) would soon be forced to wed gay couples. When I said naw, that's not how freedom of religion works, he brought up the ruling about the cake, and how it was ruled that businesses cannot discriminate, even when citing religious reasons. So how is it different? What happens when a church, which operates very similarly to a business wants to ""discriminate"" based on a religious belief?  He's got a point there. Can somebody please help me with the legal portion of that?  To be clear, I'm absolutely for gay marriage. I think the ruling was a win for freedom of religion, a win for equality, and even a win for the idea of supportive families. Just trying to address counterpoints with him."
wisconsin,3bmsw6,BrewCrewKevin,8,Tue Jun 30 21:37:10 2015 UTC,"He was against the ruling. When I asked why, he said he feared that the Catholic church (or most christian faiths for that matter) would soon be forced to wed gay couples.   Right now, Obergefell says that (emphasis mine):   Held: The Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to license a marriage between two people of the same sex and to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-State.   Kennedy also wrote:   Finally, the First Amendment ensures that religions, those who adhere to religious doctrines, and others have protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths.   The way to look at it in general IMHO, is now same-sex couples are treated the same as opposite-sex couples by the States when it comes to marriage.  If an opposite-sex couple could not come off the street and compel a church to perform their wedding ceremony before, that same church could equally not be compelled now to perform any marriage at all, SSM or OSM.  In your friend's case, is his Catholic church currently compelled by the state to marry people who have been statutorily divorced with a living ex-spouse?  If not, then the answer is clearly no, couples cannot come in off the street and require that his church perform their wedding.  If a gay couple were able to get the state to compel his church to marry them but a couple including a divorcee could not (two sets of couple circumstances without legal distinction any longer, waiting periods for divorcees notwithstanding), then the state would be violating the Equal Protection clause.  Churches are exempt from all sorts of equality laws in general: has his Catholic church lost any court battles over its women-need-not-apply policy for filling priesthood vacancies?  Some churches won't marry non-members: they have always been entitled to marry who they want and not marry who they want, and there's no precedent changed last week with respect to that."
wisconsin,3bmsw6,toasters_are_great,3,Wed Jul 1 03:13:28 2015 UTC,"AWESOME points. That's true... I hadn't thought of that- The Catholic church doesn't allow women. It doesn't give priest's the right to marry. They won't wed couples of different faiths, or previously divorced people, as you mentioned.  If they can already turn down a Muslim from getting married because they are not Christian, what makes him think they will be forced to marry gay couples?  The foggy part for me, however, was how you separate a ""religious doctrine"" from a ""mission statement"" of a business. How do you... define... a religion? Because in defining it, don't you sort of narrow your view of religion, which inherently violates freedom of religion?  For example... If I say ""a religion is an instutution that worships God."" Now Buddhists are not considered a religion. If I say A god, then nature-based or science-based belief systems are alienated. Even if I say ""worship an entity,"" now are Elvis worshippers considered a religion? I guess it just draws a strange line in the sand when we allow the state to define what constitutes a religion.  I realize in this case it's all a moot point. Christianity is the most prominent religion in our country and is therefore universally recognized. But it brought up an interesting ""slippery slope"" argument about how the law distinguishes religious doctrine from discrimination."

How do you... define... a religion? Because in defining it, don't you sort of narrow your view of religion, which inherently violates freedom of religion?   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Q&A #1 says that    Religious beliefs include theistic beliefs (i.e. those that include a belief in God) as well as non-theistic “moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views.” Although courts generally resolve doubts about particular beliefs in favor of finding that they are religious, beliefs are not protected merely because they are strongly held. Rather, religion typically concerns “ultimate ideas” about “life, purpose, and death.” Social, political, or economic philosophies, as well as mere personal preferences, are not “religious” beliefs protected by Title VII.   #2 says that the religious organization exception (can discriminate on the basis of membership only) applies to institutions whose ""purpose and character are primarily religious."" while the ministerial exception (such as no women priests) is apparently a case law First Amendment issue.  The IRS also has some thoughts about what constitutes a church."

No. Throwing fireworks out your car window? I'll personally kick your ass. When you do stupid things with fireworks you make the whole consumer industry look bad. Fireworks are dangerous and barely legal in Wisconsin. Every time some idiot does something stupid it reflects poorly on the industry as a whole and takes us one more step closer to becoming illegal again. Don't be that guy.   Can you send this part to the guy 4 doors down the block who has been shooting fireworks off intermittently for the last 2 weeks?  If you get a hold of him, also mention that I'd like to bill him for the drugs I have to put my dog on, for 2 months every summer.  All snark aside - folks, if your neighbors mention they have pets that are terrified, please limit your festivities to a day or two, or go somewhere else.  Because there are more who won't come forward, and you're being that asshole on the block.  Also a mention for veterans with PTSD: Most guys (and gals) know what the 4th means and tend to steady/prepare themselves.  But if you're shooting them off randomly at any time the weeks before and after?  You're making someone's life a living hell.  TL;DR - be courteous to your neighbors.

We set up as quiet a place for her as we can, she gets started on fluoxetine (Prozac) in early June, and off again in August to help with the random settings-off, and she's doped out of her gourd from the 2nd to the 6th on Diazepam.  We have a Thundershirt to help take the edge off, and that's kept her from shitting in her crate when the big ones go off.  If we can get out of town to somewhere quiet for a week, we do - but there are no more sick days or vacation days to take this year.  All I asked for is people to be courteous of their neighbors.  But I guess that's way too much for some.   More to the point, and this was addressed the last time OP did an AMA this time of year.  I don't care that people shoot off fireworks on the 4th. It's a national holiday, and fireworks are often part of that celebration.  I'm not an unreasonable jerk, weather gets shitty, weekends are a thing, and people will set them off on the 3rd too.  Ok, I can deal with that.  But when you pop them off, semi-nightly for 3 weeks before and 2 weeks after because you can't contain your freedom boner?  Who's being the asshole now?  I've dropped by to ask they try to keep it reasonable.  I've sent a letter, and I've even penned an op-ed asking people to please be courteous.  I've finally resorted to calling the cops, every single time the guy sets off a firework.  Guess how many times they've shown up?  PTSD is a full-time condition that makes life very difficult for more people than you know, and veterans who are dealing with PTSD are going to be more susceptible to random fireworks barrages than others.

Most people would not put a dog down because of the stress it experiences, so suggesting it seems callous.  However, people do have different beliefs when it comes to their pets.  Some people treat them as members of the family, some treat them like property, so yes, there are going to be neighbors who don't care that pets get scared, it's unfortunate, but true.  In regards to PTSD, you also have a point.  Fireworks are a fact of life. What's unfortunate is that our military and government has nearly completely failed at tackling those issues and left those folks hanging, but I can be reasonable and attempt to modify my behavior some to accommodate, however many others are going to have a different view. Try living next to a large Hispanic community, those folks love their fireworks for everything.  Not only that, they many times, have different cultural attitudes on dogs or other pets that don't jive with what many people are used to, so have an upvote or two.  You also have a point about enforcement.  For the most part, unless there are multiple complaints or danger, police are busy enough with other issues that fireworks are at the bottom of the list, however that is heavily dependent on where you live.  I can tell you that a fireworks complaint from somewhere like Monroe WI will get a swift response, but not so much in Milwaukee."

How many get another permit to legally shoot where they are actually shooting?  I like to tell myself 100%.   How often is that law actually enforced?   Very rarely, depending on where you are.  Milwaukee cops are glad to hand out (IIRC) $1,500 tickets for illegal discharge in the city limits.  Most stories I've heard from people shooting illegally that involve the police end with the cops asking you to stop.  Most of the time, it is the 2nd time the cops have to show up that will result in a ticket.  But just like speeding, it is all up to each police officer.  If you get pulled over with fireworks and no permit, technically you can lose your fireworks and get a fine.  Technically.

I have a ton of citations this time of year and I tell people that the thing is, they aren't the only ones in the parks and can really do some damage to the park or the people.

With the exception of a very few fountain-type devices, nothing should ever be held in your hand.   When roman candles fail they either: Just blow up like a large firecracker, blow out the side or, most often, blow out the back right at whomever is holding it.  Those burning stars that come out will stick to you like napalm until they burn out.  It sucks.  I've been there.   Will stores offer refunds in addition to replacements, or just replacements? If it's just replacements, is there a way we should be storing them until the next event?   We will only do replacements 99% of the time.  It is pretty rare that I'm willing to pry cash out of my hand to give it back to you. :)  Simply keeping the item in your garage is fine, in a garbage bag or something of the sort.  We will take back water-soaked items, since that is best practice for something that didn't fire or partly fired.  Heck, I had someone bring me about 10% of an item that clearly just blew up when lit.  Replaced it with almost no questions asked (We like to know if things are failing at an abnormal rate so we can pull them if need be)."

San Diego? ... and the CPSC/Customs really stepped up testing before clearing product for import.  Sammy shots are also called shotgun blasts.  I am 100% out of both.  Last year I think I mentioned Thrilling Moment rockets.  This year they are called Ring of Fire.  If you can find them, buy them.  All of them.   I sure do miss going up north and getting quarter and half sticks from the indians. plus real M-80s for a buck, those were the days.   About 12 years ago I had some association with the gentleman who went to prison for supplying the reservations with eighth, quarter and half sticks.

Same goes for the Cubs but have no quarrels with the Brew Crew. Do not have proof, but once owned Favre jerseys, White and Brooks. Alas, they do not fit me anymore and are stowed away in a cedar chest somewhere. Nearly got kicked out of a bar in Oshkosh when the Pack won the Super Bowl in 2010/11 for telling the bouncer he smells like a Bear fan and to go back to Chicago...I may have been over served at the time. Other things led up to that moment as well, involving a bar stool and a friendly hand gesture.  Do not have a favorite beer. I am partial to stouts, porters, ales and lagers. Would rather enjoy Capitol, Wisconsin, Lakefront beers than New Glarius...but im not one to complain about cold beer.  Brand of cheese? no idea, I enjoy all cheeses and blue cheese in moderation. Cheese on meat, cheese on crackers or bread, cheese alone, cheese in pasta, cheese for dipping...I enjoy it all.  I live an hour and a half away from the Dells....up north to me is Appleton/Oshkosh where the family cabin is and parents live.

wisconsin,3bj82d,toasters_are_great,2,Mon Jun 29 23:00:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that this particular one rises (or rather, sinks) to the level of cognitive dissonance: it's really just my way of pointing out that the argument isn't a particularly good one.  It's not great as a sound bite either, since Walker's name is hardly Weena, for example.  A better example would be   ""We've actually got things done,"" he said.   ... with the obvious omission of what was done, especially the fiscal mess he's left the state (literally) in.  One other thing that caught my eye was:   The gathering brought together about 4,000 conservatives at the Colorado Convention Center in Denver.   So in terms of crowd pulling power he's behind an unabashed socialist in the same city in a swing state.  That's not too promising."

My wife and I are not recent graduates, but we are leaving for the Pacific NW in two weeks.  We are also taking 4 children that more than likely will never go to college , raise families, have jobs and pay taxes in the state of WI.  Reason #1, is that we like it there.  #2, is that there was opportunity, and more importantly long term opportunity. #3 was because of culture.  Whether or not one believes that WI is on the upswing or downswing, or just limping along, we found that outside of Madison or Milwaukee, we felt uncomfortable with the far right political atmosphere and conservative nature of the people here in general.  Will younger graduates feel welcome or at home here?  I don't know.  It's not just about jobs.

We went to a tiny desert HS and had Mexican, Native American, Filipino, Japanese, Native Hawaiian, etc...    Conversely, WI does not have much in the way of variety that wasn't already here, except for a few outlier communities.  Most people do not move to WI, they leave."
wisconsin,3bidlb,where_are_the_aliens,2,Mon Jun 29 21:26:31 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, but I think your statement about rural/urban dichotomy is the same for almost every state in the Union. Nearly every rural area, with few exceptions, is conservative. Nearly every urban area, with few exceptions, is liberal. That's not a Wisconsin thing, that's a USA thing. Comparing rural Wisconsin to urban Oregon isn't really fair. I think if you move from rural Wisconsin to rural Oregon, you're more than likely moving into a more conservative area.   That said, 'conservative' is multifaceted. You've probably got less anti-federalist conservatism in Wisconsin, but you've also probably got more xenophobia. So I can see how it might be better in your situation, especially if you're not a WASPy family."

I was dismayed at the racial issues the children at our school here was experiencing.     WI is very racially segregated.  Have you lived in the NW?  Historically, even the rural counties in Or and WA are more diverse than most WI counties, they also have more movement of different kinds of people through their economic and school systems.  It is an upper Midwest thing.  The conservative movement in the NW centers more around libertarianism, though there is a fair amount of Evangelical and Mormon groups.

I don't get how a law that previously restricted something is being twisted into religious freedom.  But for those who are not Christians... religion certainly was interfering with their beliefs.  You're killing your chances at a presidential bid, Scott."

While you have the right to choose your own religion, you do not have the right to be free from religion.  Which implies that the religious have a right to persecute whomever they choose if done in the name of their religion… and you need to respect that. WTF."
wisconsin,3bie0w,MilmoWK,6,Mon Jun 29 19:52:02 2015 UTC,"It almost seems like it, doesn't it? What a twisted worldview.  It does read like that if you emphasize it a certain way I suppose:   ""To me, it is not freedom from religion, it is freedom of religion, which ultimately means we have the right to practice our religious beliefs and not have others interfere,""   I just don't get it. Yes, he still has the right to believe whatever he wants, and practice any religion that he wants. This law was giving people who don't believe what he believes a right  that he doesn't believe in. Which really is religious freedom.  Whatever. He's going to be on the wrong side of this one. Even conservatives widely accept gay marriage now."
wisconsin,3bie0w,BrewCrewKevin,0,Mon Jun 29 20:00:36 2015 UTC,"Whole heartedly agree. Some SJWs do get carried away with calling devout christians bigots. That shouldn't be the case either. That, too, probably happens more than it should.  But it also means they can't persecute others for things like gay marriage, either. Their beliefs should stay within their institution, rather than being imposed via government."
wisconsin,3bie0w,BrewCrewKevin,9,Mon Jun 29 16:24:54 2015 UTC,"I had this response to /u/KingPoopyFace before they deleted their comment about how liberals call religious people bigots, and a twisting of what freedom of religion means:  I don't call people bigots because they have a strong faith in [a] God.  I call people bigots when they are being bigots - whether or not they are hiding their bigotry behind a shield of religion.  Jesus commanded that his followers love thy neighbors as themselves.  That's a key principle that's survived thousands of years of translations and redefinitions.  In fact, as a principle, it transcends Christian faith and shows up in many other religions and sects - even in secular ethical codes.  There's no bigotry in that phrase, there's no ""excepts"", ""buts"", or ""outsiders"".  Everyone.  That was clear through this message, that was clear though all the recorded teachings, it was made clear through his reported actions.  Unquestioningly.  Remember the story of the leper?  How many times did Jesus wash someone's feet, for crying out loud, feet that belonged to someone the institution deemed unworthy?  There's even a few good lines about ministering to prostitutes, drunks, gamblers, and fornicators.  So where is there even room for someone liberal, to call religion bigoted?  You're perfectly willing to put the broad brush you've been using in our hands, but we're not making those broad swipes.  We can see the detail - there are religious people who are bigoted, when that religion expressly, adamantly, and directly contradicts their purported beliefs.  We're pointing out the hypocrites, and the people who would steer followers in the wring direction.  But you're so willing to circle wagons around them...  Kick the fuckers out.  Denounce them routinely, tell them they aren't welcome anymore.  They're not learning the lessons, they're using your congregations as human shields for their shit beliefs.  Try this on for size ""You won't be welcome to worship with our congregation until you can learn or understand what loving thy neighbor means.""  It wouldn't be the first time churches kicked people out.  But it would be the first time they would be right to do so."
wisconsin,3bie0w,no_soul_ginger,6,Mon Jun 29 16:31:11 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. Maybe I didn't clarify enough, but I'm pretty sure we hold the same beliefs here.  I've said multiple times before, the cornerstone of Christianity is to treat others like you want to be treated, without bias. Leave the judgement to judgement day. It's very clear in Christian text that we're not to judge anybody.  And yes, the leper stories... all over the bible. And when Jesus is nailed to the cross next to 2 criminals, and he prays with them, says ""Forgive them father, they know not what they do"" and tells them ""Truly, today you will join me in Paradise."" He's obviously not developing opinions about people he knows are career criminals. I could go on and on. You get it.  But we also need to be careful to distinguish between actions that you consider bigoted, and opinions that you consider bigoted. I have no problem with a religious institution not believing in gay marriage. I have no problem with a religious institution not allowing gay marriage in their church. But when they start to advocate it outside the context of their church and imposing it on others that don't choose to follow their belief system, that's when it crosses the line.  In other words: If I were to say I don't believe in gay marriage, people should respect that belief, too, as long as it doesn't get acted on. And an institution can refuse to marry homosexuals within the walls of their church. But they can't act on it outside of that church, in terms of legislation."
wisconsin,3bie0w,BrewCrewKevin,4,Mon Jun 29 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with a religious institution not believing in gay marriage. I have no problem with a religious institution not allowing gay marriage in their church. But when they start to advocate it outside the context of their church and imposing it on others that don't choose to follow their belief system, that's when it crosses the line.   Bingo.  The lack of recognition that there are others out there with similarly valid beliefs, that may not be exactly the same as one's own, is astounding.  I understand when someone says ""I don't believe gay people should be allowed to marry.""  Doesn't mean it isn't a bigoted statement, but it's only just a thought and it doesn't hurt anyone.  But when those people start funneling money into a cause to actively push their morality on the rest of us?  That's when it becomes a problem.  Buddhism has the Eightfold Path.  Its a much more comprehensive approach, and I think where as a religion it has Christianity beat.  Right Understanding, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Mindfulness, Right Effort, Right Concentration, and Right Livelihood are all spokes on the wheel.  They're all connected to each other at the center, and combined they continue to go around and around - none dependent on one other, but all interconnected and necessary.  Mindfulness, Effort, and Concentration are the parts where we work on our mental development; Speech, Action, Livelihood are the parts where we are ethical in our behavior; our Understanding and Thought give us wisdom.  When something challenges the notion of ethical balance - such as same-sex marriage - the examination and wisdom will determine the behavior, and it is very, very rare for these 3 parts to result in an outcome that in some way harms another.  That whole mindfulness thing...  I leave with a transcendent idea:  Amida Buddha.  Amida Buddha vowed as a bodhisattva (pre-enlightened being, for simplicity's sake.  Kind of like Jesus before resurrection) that he would not become free from the cycle of rebirth until all sentient beings reached enlightened states, and committed his life and all future lives to helping beings become enlightened.  How fucking noble is that?  Pretty much on par with one guy taking the sins of the world on his shoulders to atone for all in future times, right?  When you get a religion distilled into its core philosophy, you find there are more things in common than not."

wisconsin,3biwpr,BrewCrewKevin,4,Mon Jun 29 17:02:47 2015 UTC,"I don't quite understand how someone would think that adding a prerequisite such as an official picture ID would make it easier to vote   I've argued for it before for this exact reason. Because it opens the door to more automated and controlled processes in the future. And it becomes simpler because you already have a standard ID, which from a process standpoint means a consistent input.  Look at it this way:  Current Process:   Stop by voting booth on voting day Show 2 forms of ID to register. That can be a state ID, pieces of mail, or like 15 other things. If already registered, find your line based on your district and often the first letter of your last name. tell the 70-year-old volunteer your name. They find it in their 400-page binder. You have to repeat the spelling a few times. They ask you your address.  You confirm. Vote.   The proposed process, which would only be possible given you obtained an ID first:   Go to voting booth on voting day Swipe/scan card Vote.   You could already have everybody ""registered"" because everybody has an ID, and if structured the right way and given the right info from the DMV, everybody's information should already be on record. So getting a state ID could be a 1-time thing. The district could be automated from the information on the ID. So you'd get in any line. And it would go faster."
wisconsin,3biwpr,KevinSorboFan,2,Mon Jun 29 17:16:44 2015 UTC,"Just playing devil's advocate, but what do you do in the case of a stolen ID card? You almost definitely would still need some human element there to check for that, but then that is going to open up a huge can of worms for however it is decided if you look enough like the person on your picture.  I think for any problem you can think up that would be encountered with a streamlined, photo ID-based voting process would have a solution that looks basically like what our current system is. And then if that is the case, that we just keep our current system with the added hurdle of a photo ID, then the photo ID issue is the ""solution"" to a non-existent problem (widespread voter fraud).  I suppose maybe somewhere down the line, we could adopt a futuristic sort of biometric voter confirmation system, but then you would have to convince the entire population to be comfortable with giving the government their DNA or whatever, so I'm out of ideas."
wisconsin,3biwpr,BrewCrewKevin,0,Mon Jun 29 20:04:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've thought about that too, and it does bring a unique set of challenges. But it would certainly still be faster than looking up everyone's IDs, if not easier. Which may increase voter turnouts, since some urban polling booths have 1-2 hour waits on election day.  I guess in my opinion, fraud prevention is  still there. The current system- we don't know  that there's no fraud. I don't know how efficiently we'd be able to catch it. Memorize somebody's address, or even peek at it in the book when they open to it, and you can vote as any registered voter with no identification. On the contrary, people should be keeping fairly good tabs on their IDs. If it's missing, report it missing and they can re-issue it at the DMV and cancel the old one. And if it's scanned it will in fact void the old one."
wisconsin,3biwpr,Thonlo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for explaining that. Much appreciated.  Back when Voter ID was a hot issue (last year?)

The fact that we haven't heard boo about it since sort of tells you that there was a political agenda at play there. I was saying at the time, don't do it 3 weeks before an election... but right after the election, and I'd support it.  Because then we have 2 years until the next large election, giving plenty of time to figure their stuff out with the DMV.

wisconsin,3bg6px,BrewCrewKevin,-2,Mon Jun 29 02:17:29 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, Please... somebody do this.  And I agree- I also think the premise is flawed. Healthcare is a very difficult situation. Because while I think a 1st world country should have 1st world healthcare for all, I hate the idea of nationalizing it, because costs skyrocket. And while Obama tried to find a happy medium with the pre-existing conditions and the mandatory insurance portions of the bill, they really ignore the REAL problem with our healthcare system.  The REAL problem with our healthcare system isn't on the patient level, it's at the upper levels. It has to do with the relationships and laws mandating relationships between 1) Government regulatory groups, 2) Pharmaceutical companies, 3) Hospitals and heathcare providers, and 4) insurance companies. Which is why procedure for procedure our country's costs are way above the average.  For example: once drugs from pharmaceutical companies are approved by the FDA (which only tests safety, nothing cost-based), medicare has to cover whatever price the pharmaceutical dictates. No competition, no negotiation. So healthcare providers have NO problem prescribing it, because medicare is going to be forced to pay for it anyways. That's a huge loophole that's a source of major abuse. So Pharma companies obviously make whatever profit they want. Hospitals get their cut of it from promoting it. And insurance companies (which get their income from end users) are forced to pass the costs on. Just as one example... (Ninja edit: source)  So by the time it gets to us, the end users, it's already too late. There is too much cost sunk into our care before we even get it. I do agree with the mandatory insurance and pre-existing condition riders in it, but it really doesn't address 90% of the problems.  Honestly, I would rather see a free-market end user solution and have the abuse at upper levels addressed, rather than leaving the upper level manipulation and attempting to sort of socialize the end-user portion. It's a terrible solution to the overall problem.  BUUUUT.. I digress (sort of). Overall, I would LOVE to see one of these republican nominees step up and address it.

wisconsin,3b7fq3,MyL1ttlePwnys,-1,Fri Jun 26 20:14:51 2015 UTC,"""Force people to get gay married""  That's not at all what people mean.   Can a private institution Brigham Young University discipline students for failing to meet their standards of conduct (drinking, fornication, etc)? Can private religious universities refuse to offer co-Ed housing to unmarried heterosexual couples?  If you think Hypothetical U. has the right to withhold co-ed housing from unmarried heterosexual couples.....can you see how they might feel they have the right to withhold housing from married homosexual couples?  You see, to Hypothetical U., both fornication and homosexual acts violate their understanding of sexual morality. Both the urge to fornicate and the urge to commit homosexual acts are urges that people are born with to vastly different degrees. It's no one's fault that they were ""born this way"", BUT it IS expected of the students of Hypothetical U. to resist these urges as their morality system demands of them. Some people are born with a propensity to temper, some are born with a propensity for pride.....some are born with a propensity to engage in homosexual acts. Everyone has their own cross to bear, as they say, and in attending Hypothetical U., they have agreed to submit their behavior to review, and to accept the consequences of violating the morality system they willingly participate in.  This is the framework from which Hypothetical U. operates.   As for those who have homosexual urges, Hypothetical U. absolutely believes that they are capable of not acting upon them. Hypothetical U. won't refuse to enroll homosexuals. They won't kick out people who come out as homosexuals.   It's an urge, not an identity, according to Hypothetical U. It's not like being black. You can't control being black. You can control the urge to engage in homosexual activities, just like you can control the urge to fornicate, or drink, or lie. Hypothetical U. views these all from a similar perspective.  At Hypothetical U. being a homosexual means nothing more than someone else being who is predisposed to want to drink, or to fornicate, or to curse, or whatever. For the Federal government to say that they cannot refuse housing to married homosexual couples (due to religious objections) is like telling BYU that they cannot refuse housing to offer co-Ed heterosexual housing (due to religious objections). Both are considered to be integral to exercising their religion.  I realize that's a very foreign world-view. It took a lot of reading and talking with people I didn't understand to finally wrap my mind around this perspective. Does that make sense?"
wisconsin,3b7fq3,Kiltmanenator,2,Sun Jun 28 07:04:48 2015 UTC,The ruling doesnt require Catholics to do gay services or require any of what you are saying...Its just that people who are gay can marry a person that is gay.

wisconsin,3b7fq3,Abzug,2,Mon Jun 29 00:28:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and that's my entire point.

I'm not sure it is a threat.   The question that needs to be answered is does contractual law (which attendees participate in with these rules the colleges have) circumnavigate this protected status of marriage.   I hope you can understand that when people say they fear government infringement on their religious liberties, they don't mean they fear that the government is going to force them to diddle dudes or become lesbians, they are talking about the kinds of lawsuits you just described. It's a very real thing and not at all an imagined threat, like so many people want to dismiss out of hand (because they don't take the time to try and understand).   Religious liberties were being infringed upon with the state amendments disallowing same sex marriages, though.   A number of religions sanction same sex marriages, but some states disallow church practices to be legally observed thorough common law marriage.   The state Constitutional measures codified one version of Christianity over their interpretations of the same text.     The infringement that you mention above is extremely limited, whereas every married same sex couple have their legal rights changed based on what state they lived in.   Imagine (if you are married) that any married couple would not be recognized as married outside their state.   Imagine moving to another state and being forced to remarry in another common law marriage. That's what this law nullified is the patchwork of laws recognizing marriage."
wisconsin,3b7fq3,Abzug,0,Mon Jun 29 09:44:20 2015 UTC,"I totally agree on the benefits, and am very happy that my gay friends can get married and stay married wherever, but the concerns about threats to free exercise of religion are absolutely not something to laugh about or dismiss: the solicitor general in the SCOTUS case says it will be an issue.   Justice Samuel Alito cited Bob Jones University vs. the United States, a 1983 decision allowing the federal government to strip a Christian university of its tax-exempt status for discriminating against interracial couples.  ""In the Bob Jones case, the Court held that a college was not entitled to tax­exempt status if it opposed interracial marriage or interracial dating. So would the same apply to a university or a college if it opposed same­-sex marriage?"" he asked.  Responded the solicitor general: ""You know, ­­I don’t think I can answer that question without knowing more specifics, but it’s certainly going to be an issue. I don’t deny that. I don't deny that, Justice Alito. It is going to be an issue.""      Numerous amici—even some not supporting the States—have cautioned the Court that its decision here will “have unavoidable and wide-ranging implications for religious liberty.” Brief for General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists et al. as Amici Curiae 5. In our society, marriage is not simply a governmental institution; it is a religious institution as well. Id., at 7. Today’s decision might change the former, but it cannot change the latter. It appears all but inevitable that the two will come into conflict, particularly as individuals and churches are confronted with demands to participate in and endorse civil marriages between same-sex couples.  The majority appears unmoved by that inevitability. It makes only a weak gesture toward religious liberty in a single paragraph, ante, at 27. And even that gesture indicates a misunderstanding of religious liberty in our Nation’s tradition. Religious liberty is about more than just the protection for “religious organizations and persons . . . as they seek to teach the principles that are so ful- filling and so central to their lives and faiths.” Ibid. Religious liberty is about freedom of action in matters of religion generally, and the scope of that liberty is directly correlated to the civil restraints placed upon religious practice.7"
wisconsin,3b7fq3,Kiltmanenator,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:06:33 2015 UTC,"Finally, it must be emphasized that religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine pre- cepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned. The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths, and to their own deep aspirations to continue the family structure they have long revered. The same is true of those who oppose same-sex marriage for other reasons. In turn, those who believe allowing same- sex marriage is proper or indeed essential, whether as a matter of religious conviction or secular belief, may engage those who disagree with their view in an open and search- ing debate. The Constitution, however, does not permit the State to bar same-sex couples from marriage on the same terms as accorded to couples of the opposite sex.    I feel this is the correct view here.     Why a justice would put a tax exempt status in comparison to the rights of an individual is mind boggling. After all, that is the issue that Roberts brought up resulted in the loss of a tax exempt status. This status change is nothing compared to the sanctity of marriage for gay couples looking for federal and state rights under the 14th amendment. The individual loss of rights should trump those of organizational rule making.   Ultimately, there will be issues for religious institutions. But that doesn't mean they should shy away from the equal protection clause.   If they decided that way, nothing would pass their bench."

I want to help because it took me a long time before I could comprehend and articulate these anxieties that I too once found so baffling.   Let's begin.  Can a private religious university refuse to offer co-Ed housing because they don't want to encourage or allow fornication?  Can a private religious university discipline students for failing to meet religious standards of conduct, like Brigham Young University and their strict rules on drinking?  Can the Federal government force them to do otherwise?  Would you consider that to be an infringement on their religious liberties?  Private religious universities look at homosexual acts in a similar fashion. I hope you can at least try to understand that this isn't an irrational fear of theirs."

wisconsin,3b7fq3,smiles134,-2,Sun Jun 28 13:37:30 2015 UTC,I don't care if you think it's irrational. I'll ask again:  Do you think a private religious university has the legal right refuse to offer co-Ed housing because they don't want to encourage or allow fornication?
wisconsin,3b7fq3,Kiltmanenator,3,Sun Jun 28 16:11:03 2015 UTC,"Answer?  No, but.  This hinges on protected class - now that a marriage right is the law of the land.  Technicalities will be forthcoming, we should expect, which would make orientation/gender classes that cannot be used to discriminate housing, employment, and so forth by any public or private institutions.  As the way things stand exactly right now?  A private university could refuse admission or housing - they would get sued, they would lose, and LBGT folks would move that much closer to having protected status.  What we need to get across is that the ""right to discriminate"" is not a right.  The institution does not have the right to exercise its legal, financial muscle to discriminate.  Your line of argument is moot.  You're ignoring that it comes from a flawed premise and based on a right that doesn't exist."

wisconsin,3b7fq3,Kiltmanenator,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:08:27 2015 UTC,"You were talking about married co-ed housing.  Not just co-ed housing.  If you want to take your goalposts and go home, I'm not stopping you.  Any school has the right to offer separate housing, however, soon there will be a protected class with respect to gender, so institutions should recognize that segregated housing based on binary gender is going to be a problem down the road and adjust accordingly.  For the record, I went to a private college, which had separated buildings, separate floors when the building was co-ed, and also room-by-room co-ed housing.  A married couple was not given special dispensation and was granted a voucher for cost difference if living off-campus, if either in that couple were receiving housing assistance from the college.  Quite a nice solution, for the once-in-a-blue-moon married couple seeking to live in campus housing situation that you're outlining."
wisconsin,3b7fq3,no_soul_ginger,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:15:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to move the goalposts, I'm just trying to say that these schools feel like if they can use their religion as a reason to restrict unmarried co-Ed housing to prevent fornication (a sin), they should be able to restrict married housing to prevent homosexual acts (a sin). They don't see ""homosexual"" as an identity any more than they would see ""fornicator"" as an identity. Both are just consider urges that are to be resisted. Some people are born with more of a propensity to fornicate than others, and some people are born with more of propensity for pride, and some people are born with more of a propensity for homosexual acts.   I don't think like that and I'm not asking for you to. I'm just asking you to contemplate how that framework operates and how the people within it feel it is consistent and that applying it to private religious institutions is part of their right to exercise religion."
wisconsin,3b7fq3,Kiltmanenator,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:45:17 2015 UTC,"No one is arguing that a married homosexual couple have a different set of criteria applied to them than the married hetero couple.  If an institution allows one and not the other, it is (currently) open to litigation, and in the near future will be illegal.  Anything outside of that is an apples-oranges comparison, and none of those have any bearing on the issue you raised, or fly in the face of an institutional ethical code.  The only thing that opens an institution to litigation is if it handles people differently based on a protected status, that is all.  Everyone must be treated equally.  If a school has a problem with a married couple who happens to be homosexual seeking campus housing or accommodations, then they have to apply the same standard to a married couple who is heterosexual.  You seem to be struggling with this.  LGBT will very shortly be protected statuses.  Just like race.  So, in a way to better understand (and this is not some cheap click-bait shot) the situation, replace any instance of gender/preference as a determining factor, and substitute race (which is a protected status).  Better yet - do the old truth table trick and flip the pronouns around.  If it doesn't pass the test the other way around, guess what?  You seem to be asking ""But where will discrimination still be allowed?"" but we're telling you that it isn't going to be, at all.  We said no more cookies, it doesn't matter how you ask."

The general tone of responses to those comments has geen dismissal ""lol, no one is gonna make you gay marry"". This whole thread is about how much of a dumbfuck Scott Walker is for worrying about ""muh liberties"".  My whole purpose was to use the housing argument to prove that he's not wrong, and you agree! What they feel to be exercise of religion is, just as you said, not going to be allowed because gays will soon be considered a protected class.   I'm not actually asking ""but where will discrimination be allowed"". Edit: If I got sidetracked there, I apologize.  I'm asking ""do you now understand that all those times really religious people vocalized concerns about their religious liberties, they were right, and you were wrong to dismiss their concerns as bigoted fear of SCOTUS making men diddle each other?"" No one ever said to the religious right, ""Guess what, when gay marriage happens, you aren't gonna be able to do a whole of things you thought you could and your tax exempt status is gonna be jeopardized. Deal with it"". They said ""My god, you're an idiot. Shut up and stop being afraid of the gays"". No, the religious right absolutely had something to fear. You just said it, and I'm not disputing it.  What you're describing when you say ""it isn't going to be, at all"" is exactly right, and it's exactly what the religious right has been forecasting, and it's exactly what they've been laughed out of the room for every.damn.time.  I find it amazing that these concerns have been dismissed time and time again while the fight was underway, and now the gay marriage is legal nationwide the response is ""Well, duh, of course you won't be able to do those things""."

The rail line connecting Chicago to Minneapolis via Milwaukee and Madison would have been nearly self-sustaining without even considering the ticket revenue and economic corridor that would have been created.   The high-speed rail project was actually being planned and designed for 20 years prior to the federal grant. The reason Wisconsin was chosen was because we had a literal shovel ready project. We had already spent millions of dollars on planning  and designing. Because of the cancellation, we will now end up paying millions more in damages because we defaulted on contracts.   Building the high speed rail line would have been cheaper for the state than cancelling it."

The fiscal multiplier of infrastructure spending is 1.59, according to Moody's, so presuming that's accurate (and the recession was deeper than it looked like at the time of that report, and the deeper the recession the higher the multiplier) we'd be looking at a rise in state GDP of about $1.3 billion.  The state as a rule of thumb captures about 5% of GDP from taxes, so could reasonably have expected about $65m in additional tax revenue from that.  Trust fund-wise, the WRS has managed 7.0% over 10 years in its core fund, and 7% of $65m is about $4.6m.  The cost of running the service would have been about $4.7m/year net of fares so there's good reason to believe that you are quite right: state government finances would break even and on top of that the state would have benefited overall."

Prior to the civil war, the north was becoming industrialized much faster than the south. The south was still very farming-dependent, particularly cotton. Which was VERY labor intensive. So the south was getting fed up with the north for pushing laws that made a lot of sense for industrialized societies, but not for the south. Slavery was probably the best example of this. While it was the right thing to do morally, the south had to basically re-develop their economy. Most confederate soldiers, however, were not fighting to preserve the enslavement of african americans in particular, but trying to preserve a rural way of life, free from the industrialized lawmakers from the north.  (Disclaimer: I in no way condone slavery of any kind. it was obviously the wrong thing to do. Just giving some context to the ""state's rights"" argument and how it really made sense for the south in a lot of ways.)  But on gay marriage... How is any state affected differently?

wisconsin,3b7fq3,mnpilot,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:05:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was the primary issue. What I'm trying to say though, is for many Confederate soldiers, it was about more than that. It had to be.   There is no way the south gets enough support to develop an army and put up a good fight for succession because of a power trip over slaves. I'm just trying to demonstrate that it represented a resistance to the push for Central federal government need based geopolitical differences. And while they were obviously on the wrong side of history, it's interesting to think about what it meant to their economy.   So when you take the morality of slavery out of the picture, you realize that slaves were a major resource so to speak. Then, it's then not unlike rural counties in Wisconsin being upset by a larger city like Madison thinking they know what rural life is like. Especially if Madison were to rule that, for example, combines are dangerous and need to be banned. Rural Wisconsin would fight tooth and nail because their economy and their livelihoods are tightly knitted to that resource.   Again, obviously there are stark differences in morality and basic human rights.  In other words, I'd be willing to bet that if you asked 10 Confederate soldiers what they were fighting for, a few would say slavery,  but the majority would say because life is different down here and the north doesn't understand our needs. That message, while still influenced by slavery, would resonate more with people. So they would say they are fighting because their state wants to run their own state.  Obviously, since slavery was the primary driver of the succession movement, historians will use that explanation. But that doesn't mean it was that simple; that black and white (no pun intended)."

And it's not fair to equate States rights with slavery like that. They are not simple problems. While slavery now has a very clear answer to all of us, there were different factors at play in the south."
wisconsin,3b7fq3,BrewCrewKevin,-1,Mon Jun 29 01:55:25 2015 UTC,"There’s a difference between the complex and varied motivations of individuals and the causes their sacrifices ultimately furthered. Since we as a nation are talking not just about the “Confederate flag”, but also monuments, statues, memorials, etc. it’s actually really important to talk about the individual motivations. If we are to believe you when you suggest that the rank-and-file were motivated primarily or exclusively by a desire to preserve slavery, then that completely changes….  …how we should react to people who fly Lee’s battle flag with the aim of honoring the war dead.  …how we should react to future attempts to find or design a replacement flag.  …how we should react to statues, monuments, memorials, etc whose focus is the Confederate dead (regardless of whether or not they are flying any flags).  Let’s get into it:  Moderns looking back have a very difficult time empathizing with someone who volunteered to fight the Union. The easiest answer for them is “racism, obvies”, and most just leave it at that. That’s pretty weaksauce. I don’t study history so I can engage in presentism; I can’t learn anything that way. People, especially people on the West coast have an INCREDIBLY hard time even conceiving of a motivation beyond white supremacy/slavery. For people like that I have a few things to say.  Let's start with the issue of state loyalty superceding loyalty to the Federal government:  People had been self-governing in one form or another in Virginia since 1607. By 1861, that was a 254 year history. By comparison the USA was only 85 years old. Less than a century. The arrangement of the States under the Constitution was only 72 years old.      72 years vs 254 years. The USA won’t be 254 years old until 2030.   Another important aspect of the state-Federal relationship is the idea of Federal supremacy and self-determination. The USA was born out of an act of treason in which the colonies decided to dissolve the political ties that bound them to the Crown. Prior to the Constitution we worked under the Articles of Confederation in which each state was really more of a State, with a sovereignty all of their own. That sovereignty was given up when the Constitution was ratified, but loyalty to the state over the Federal government and identification as a Virginian first would not die easily, certainly not in 72 years. In fact, it was the very idea that Virginia and others had not only dissolved political bonds before, but also had /willingly/ come together to create the Federal government that made them feel justified in seceding.   “Not only have I been around for 182 years longer than you, but you never would have been free of the British without me, and the Federal government as created by the Constitution would never have been empowered without my willing act of submission. I can leave just as easily as I came.”    There is a reason that we now call our nation THE United States of America instead of THESE United States of America. Our ideas about the state-Federal relationship and identity have changed a great deal since then. It took the bloodiest war in our history to change that.  Now, take the aforementioned identity/loyalty dynamics and add the Southern concept of Honor.  ….then add the Southern history of martial prowess;  ….then add the natural independence that accompanies any decentralized, agrarian economy/society;  ….then add peer pressure that results from all units being locally raised. Regiments were filled with your friends, relatives, and neighbors. If you didn’t fight with them, they were dying in your place. Joining the Union forces to fight against your state (which you most likely identified with over the Federal government) that was even more unthinkable. Virginians killing Virginians? Despicable, of course.  ….then add the harsh treatment of deserters and draft dodgers (the wealthy and slave-overseers could get or buy exemptions, of course).  It should be clear that there were plenty of reasons for people to fight the Union that have absolutely nothing to do with economic greed or white supremacy. I hope it can be seen how even if slavery never existed in the South, that any war of secession would result in similar responses from those who fought. Honestly, this is why I have to roll my eyes at how forcefully some people like to just shout over and over “WAAHHHHHH TREASON TRAITORS WAAAAHHHHH” because it outs them as people who don’t understand the state-Federal identity dynamics and don’t understand that Lincoln would have behaved exactly the same if, say, abolitionist New England seceded because they refused to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act: He would have kept them in the Union by force, regardless. Lincoln refused to remove Federal troops from the south, and responded to the attack on Fort Sumter not to end slavery, but to preserve the Union and prove a point that even though states came together to form the USA voluntarily, they could never leave. Look at when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. Now look at when the war actually started. He would have ended the military campaign if he could have without ending slavery in the CSA, so long as they rejoined the Union and accepted that there would be no more slave states out west.  Using the “treason” angle and refusing to acknowledge motivations to enlist that aren't WHITE POWER are low-tier arguments based on a boring understanding of the past, so I actually just end up feeling sad when I hear people use it because it’s got to be so boring to think that that’s how it all went down."

It is considered to be a sacred and auspicious symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.   It has been used as a decorative element in various cultures since at least the Neolithic, and is found on a man's tunic depicted in a Roman mosaic at the Villa Romana del Casale in Sicily. It is known most widely as an important symbol long used in Indian religions, denoting ""auspiciousness."" It was adopted as such in pre-World War I-Europe and later, and most notably, by the Nazi Party and Nazi Germany prior to World War II. In many Western countries, the swastika has been highly stigmatized because of its use in and association with Nazism.  It continues to be commonly used as a religious symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism.   The Sanskrit word swastika (Devanagari: स्वस्तिक) ""lucky or auspicious object"".  The older term gammadion cross in Western literature derives mainly from its appearance, which is identical to four Greek gamma letters affixed to each other.

Because of this it's all too easy to dismiss them and not even bother to muster some charity and make an attempt at understanding (I'm not asking for outright agreement). I want to help because it took me a long time before I could comprehend and articulate these anxieties that I too once found so baffling.   Let's begin.  Can a private religious university refuse to offer co-Ed housing because they don't want to encourage or allow fornication?  Can a private religious university discipline students for failing to meet religious standards of conduct, like Brigham Young University and their strict rules on drinking?  Can the Federal government force them to do otherwise?  Would you consider that to be an infringement on their religious liberties?  Private religious universities look at homosexual acts in a similar fashion. I hope you can at least try to understand that this isn't an irrational fear of theirs."

wisconsin,3b56hx,jelloagain,2,Fri Jun 26 13:47:22 2015 UTC,"Two obvious problems with TFA:   The May losses were not statistically significant.  The monthly surveys like any statistical sample have their own margins of error, and a difference between two of them of 8,600 doesn't meet the statistically significant mark (which is about 10,000, either way).  You can see the statistically significant changes highlighted in blue on the May jobs report, just remember that some changes are statistically significant by random chance (about 5% of them if everything has actually stayed the same) so don't read too much into any individual figure being blue. The thing to look at is the bigger picture, longer timescales, that there hasn't been anything happening to the jobs total so far this year, although this may be a reversion to the mean:  we know that the monthly survey overestimated job growth in December 2014 by about 10,000, since we now have the QCEW data for that month.  So it could be that it's starting from a statistically anomalously high point so differences look bad, or it could mean that the monthly survey is continually overestimating quarterly growth by 10,000 and the jobs total is really falling.  The household survey of employment independently of the place of work survey highlighted in TFA also says that things have been flat since the end of last year. County-level unemployment rates are not seasonally-adjusted.  As you can see from the state-level adjustments (0.0% in April and -0.1% in May), it's normal for the unadjusted unemployment rate to go up ever so slightly between those two months.  Unless you want to go deep into statistical voodoo, you should only compare unadjusted numbers a whole number of years apart."

They were regulated to spend 80% of premiums on health care...that thing they're supposed to be insuring for.  Operating costs and...drumroll...profits make up the 20%.  See point 1, above.

wisconsin,3b56hx,no_soul_ginger,6,Fri Jun 26 16:09:01 2015 UTC,"Because health care is a vital need. Water utility doesn't turn people down because they have bad credit, and heat doesn't get shut off for poor folks.  Since the insurance industry has become necessary for all Americans to become involved in, except for those wealthy enough to pay out-of-pocket for everything, it must be regulated.  When a person who has been purchasing insurance - paying in advance for future coverage - gets dropped from an insurer because they fell ill, that company has denied that person a service they have been paying for.  When that person cannot get covered by another company, because of an illness that they had/have, the industry is forcing that person into unreasonable and cruel circumstances - even if they can get coverage, often insurance companies would have such exhorbinant rates, the person could not afford coverage.  Once health insurance became a necessary component of healthcare treatment, the insurance industry lost the right to refuse.  It took an act of Congress and a Supreme Court ruling to demonstrate that point."
wisconsin,3b56hx,no_soul_ginger,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:14:35 2015 UTC,"i lived without health insurance for a while and knew the risk i was taking.    The risk you were taking is that you would get a very serious illness and need a hospital. Your bill may be too big and force you into bankruptcy. However, by law, hospitals cannot refuse service to anybody, even if they know you can't afford it. So to make up for that, they are given federal grants and funds to compensate for unpaid bills. Which is funded by federal taxes, from hard working Americans.   So ultimately, the risk you were taking is that i would be paying your bills for you. That's why even conservatives like myself support mandatory insurance. Because the alternate is an entitlement program.   Don't get me wrong though, the ACA has a ton of other problems. It really doesn't address the reasons why health care expenses are too high to begin with, which comes down to how big pharma companies charge for their products, how malpractice lawyers and insurance gets their way so often, and essentially that some things are regulated as if it were a utility, and some things are not related at all- making it a difficult industry to compete in, while allowing monopolizing tactics to thrive.

I'm not saying that I think Obamacare is great, but I do think the ""creates/destroys jobs"" argument is a bit short-sighted.

What the hell is a conservative going to say to this except ""umm, no, this is a stupid opinion piece."" While I agree with it and think the author's context for speaking is an important special interest (considering he is VP for the Sierra Club), I really cannot stand the partisanship we play AT EVERY POSSIBLE MOMENT just because many of us dislike our government in the state. Let's at least try to have a reasoned discussion while attempting to be moderate (that is, until we get to the comments...)  Seriously. Stick to actual news stories please."

Everything just described is how he operates and the climate he has fostered.  So ... I don't see anything changing anytime soon on a left-leaning, user-focused site such as Reddit.

In fact, it's because I disagree so wholeheartedly that the only way we can actually come together is to be more open opposite of how things have been done by the Legislature and Administration, and sadly everyone just continues to jerk it... including myself...  Regardless of how Reddit might lean, the minority voice deserves a fair voice in our public discourse, and the best places to start it are here, in places that are left leaning. The best way to correct misconceptions is by doing this as well. It's easy to attack a faceless, named apparition online, but it's much hard to try to find common ground and work to make a better Wisconsin.  I just hope that all of us on this subreddit can start making that jump and trying to find whatever common ground exists. There's actually a surprising amount of it regardless of what some might post here. Everyone is a stereotype when you don't know them as a person."

Honestly, your best bet is a place like the Dells. The Kalahari has very large houses you can rent and it is actually pretty reasonable for groups of 20+. They cater to folks like yourself, it just might be hard getting a house during a weekend.

wisconsin,3b36mc,cs556,2,Thu Jun 25 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"Most pricing is set by manufacturers.  Stores only get a small amount of leeway in setting price; the overwhelming trend in sporting goods has been towards Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) policies, to limit the damage that online discounting causes, and to put a stop to the ""perpetual sales"" that big box retailers run (REI is the worst for this kind of behavior).  First, MAP policies were met with skepticism by retailers, but vendors have realized how important it is for all their customers to have a level playing field, and MAP policies now have real teeth to inflict pain on a retailer who flagrantly violates pricing.  Do a price comparison sometime.  The same fleece from the same brand should be within a dollar from retailer to retailer - same with guns, tents, soccer balls, and so on.  The allure of Dick's is the illusion of a deal.  A big giant store must be able to offer better prices, right?  In actuality, the big store has less leeway in discounts, sales, and promotional pricing than the small independents like Shepherd & Schaller or Divepoint...because they're being watched.  The biggest problem in keeping the field level is online, and just about everyone seems to have a 3rd party Amazon outlet now.  Amazon has been cracking down on their vendors who aren't tracking price fluctuations and shutting down dealers violating MAP, because so many brands sell to Amazon direct, and Amazon loses margin when the matrix spits out a lower price.  Funny part is Amazon isn't policing their own 3rd party dealers, though...that would mean having to close a bunch of accounts who pay Amazon.  Source: I live neck deep in this shit.  Added:  Big box has an Achilles heel, and that's their inventory management timeline.  From the time a rack, shelf, or peg hook is empty, to the time the buying office is flagged and a reorder processed (usually EDI at this scale), is still 2x as long as a small shop can address a low-stock situation and refill their shelves.  For major vendors who have count & fill service reps or hire Franklin Resource Group to manage that, the timeline is much shorter, but still longer than Bob looking at a rack and calling his vendor or rep a few minutes later.  The flip side is that the small shop may not have the open to buy or credit availability to fill that order, while Dick's has million dollar credit limits.  Small shops balance that by trying to offer better service and more knowledgeable staff.  Try getting a technical answer from your random Dicks' employee..."

wisconsin,3b36mc,_stonecoldsaidso,2,Thu Jun 25 19:30:05 2015 UTC,"Lol.  You're going to tell me they're actually still a co-op?  Keep drinking the Kool-Aid.  When your store square footage is >30,000, you have a corporate office where purchasing happens, and your door count is >100 stores nationally, you're a big box retailer."

wisconsin,3b36mc,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:35:52 2015 UTC,"Well, for one they're primarily an online retailer and not a brick-and-mortar store. But that's not the major part.  REI is a recreational consumer cooperative. The profits are funneled into a non-profit (REI Foundation) to promote environmental stewardship and education. They have major differences in management, training, and overall company philosophy. They don't have the same inventory systems as big box stores, and their staff is well trained in their area of expertise.   Also, I haven't really seen the ""perpetual sale"" thing you're talking about. They run a separate store, REI-Outlet, which has sales on overstocked and clearance items. They also have members only sales a few times a year where you get 20% off one item, and they send out coupons to members on occasion. But I haven't really seen the 'perpetual sale' behavior that you're referring to.   Saying that Dick's and REI are the same type of store is just ridiculous, frankly."
wisconsin,3b36mc,no_soul_ginger,5,Thu Jun 25 19:43:49 2015 UTC,"A couple edits.  Some of the profits are funneled into their own 501c.3.  REI stopped being a legit co-op business at least a decade ago.  They are as profit-driven and corporate as any other Fortune 500 company.  Co-op directors don't get appointed to cabinet-level positions.  Online retailer?  LOL.  REI is a brick and mortar operation.  There are 3 in the Twin Cities, 3 in the Detroit metro, 4 in Chicagoland, 1 in Madison, one in Milwaukee, one in Indianapolis, one in St. Louis, one in Springfield, and soon another in Des Moines.  That's just my region.  From a market saturation standpoint, there are more REI stores per person in California than there are Ganders.  The sale event after sale event, plus in-store unadvertised sale prices, combined with the ""members deals"" that run consistently - aside from the 10% membership return (which is technically a 10% sale, year round) was the top reason for K2/Jarden to start developing MAP policies years ago.  Many brands saw their values plummet. They've been under fire for a while now and pulled back on the frequency of sales - this is only in the last 2 years.  As for ethics - ask around about REI-label product's history.  Where is it sourced?  Who makes it?  Who does the design work?  These things are contract-built, using the lowest-cost source the contract factories can find, and designs are straight copies of branded merchandise - with the fewest alterations necessary to avoid a lawsuit.  Then the pricing is determined at a specific percentage below a branded product's MSRP; in order to maximize REI's profit margin, and effectively force brands to cap pricing to compete.  This hurts brands, because having to maintain a price point regardless of tarriff increases (footwear is about to get real expensive), freight increases, or source increases damages their internal margins...someone has to eat that loss, and sales reps aren't going to take much more in commissions reductions.  Private label merch does so much more harm to the marketplace than sale events do - and REI does both.    You want to point to foundations, causes, 1% FTP, and so on as an indication of a company doing good?  Remember that Chuck and Dave Koch do a lot of donations to museums..."

It was a pointless, futile endeavor.  Just between quarters, say Q3 and Q4, entire departments would turn over staff.  2-3 times a year.  Winter product was the worst to try and train, because half the folks there were seasonal only, and the ones who weren't, didn't get paid enough to give a shit.  My time was more valuable re-merchandising and just cleaning up shelves - and that was the shit these flunkies were supposed to do.  I'm not in ammo, but I have heard that demand has an effect on price.  A shortage - whether manufactured or not - will drive up that price.  No one gives a shit if The North Face is sold out of Denali jackets, but .22 or 9mm ammo?  Hell to pay.  I'm pretty sure that some large retailers held back some stock so they could keep the prices up, even after all the news about the Army getting all the bullets wound down."

He took on Act 10 and seemed to set the stage for RTW. He was touring the state actively trying to set businesses up for job creation. Our state unemployment rate went down (as did the rest of the country's yes), but I thought he was doing good. Sure, he didn't hit 250k jobs. I knew he wouldn't when he said it. But IIRC we created 100k+ in his first term.  That being said, this second term is a joke. He hasn't even been in the state. The budget still has major deficits that are unaccounted for, and he's borrowing for transportation again- exactly what he trotted that he fixed from the Doyle administration.  All in all, he doesn't have my vote for president. I don't regret voting for him in the past, because I supported him in the 1st election and the recall election. And while I was leery about a second term, there wasn't another viable option.  If there was any defense though, it's that Minnesota is right there with us. I thought it was heaven across the border?

wisconsin,3axwkn,phoenix1984,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:27:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll admit there's a lot of pretty stubborn Republicans out there. But contrary to popular belief, there's some like me too, who are more reasonable and question the process a lot.  The problem is that what Reddit (and other liberal environments) tend to focus on is facts. I'm an engineer- so I get that. I'm all about facts. But the problem with that is that while there are myriad ways for the government to regulate and nationalize different sectors and make a positive impact, it all adds to the size of government. Conservatives like me typically advocate for smaller government. I'm not naive enough to think that the free market doesn't have some problems with it, but we also believe that we'd rather live in a world of freedoms, despite the inefficiencies it brings.  It's not always about what people need, it's about what they deserve. It's not about leveling the playing field in terms of what we have, it's about leveling the playing field in terms of what we are given in terms of both assistance and opportunity. Obviously that tends to favor the well-off.  I guess all in all, on this ongoing debate about the problems with socialism vs. capitalism- I totally lean more towards capitalism. Because the way I see it, somebody always has an unfair advantage. In socialism, it favors the poor. In capitalism, it favors the rich. But the way I see it, if I'm going to favor somebody, it should be  those who are successful, not unsuccessful. Because the net impact on society will be more positive if those who are successful and have power are given our spare resources.  Yeah, I know, trickle-down-economics blah blah blah. Somebody will dispute all this, I'm sure.  /rant. Sorry, just giving some of my overall theory. Since I've been on Reddit, I've given this all a ton of thought, mostly because it's constantly being challenged."

That's why you'll have to work hard to get a downvote from me, because in depth thought deserves positive karma, whether I agree with the outcome or not.   I always think of Politics in a way of who delivers what.   If a politician delivers change that is harmful or acts deliberately misleading, I won't support him/her. Execution deserves attention.  Given the nature of the outcomes of our legislature, have you made any fundamentally different evaluations of our state government or their modus operandi?"
wisconsin,3axwkn,Abzug,2,Thu Jun 25 12:33:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I appreciate that. I don't even mind being downvoted- because I know full well it's mostly because it's an unpopular opinion, and unfortunately, that's how Reddit works. It's when I'm told my beliefs are wrong when they are by no means objective that really bothers me the most.  In all honestly, since being on this sub, my beliefs have changed somewhat. In my everyday life, I'm surrounded by republicans. They all still praise Walker and everything he does, and I hear the same rhetoric quite a bit as we used to see from guys like swiitfarm- pretty hardline.   And I still identify a lot with that, obviously, but it's toned down. I wouldn't say I've become any more liberal necessarily, because I take everything I read on Reddit with a grain of salt with the obvious bias. But I've gained a lot more understanding of what it means.  Most importantly, it's made me question my own party. While it's very clear to me that I am not liberal, I am more confused about what it means to be a republican in today's political atmosphere. I find so much hypocracy within the party, that they don't seem to have a stance beside attacking liberals. Some say small government, some say bigger military- which seem so polar opposite to me. They run on the platforms of freedom, liberty, and limited government interaction, yet the evangelical republicans seem to take every opportunity to shove Christianity down the public  throat.  But I certainly identify more with libertarians. Because I think the biggest flaw with the republican party today is that they fail to evolve on issues like gay marriage, abortion, etc. They stick to the traditional evangelical stances instead. That drives me crazy."

I belonged to a Facebook group that was exceedingly hard right wing, and getting piled on is freaking annoying.   To make it worse, it was 07 and I'm pretty sure many of the folks had ""sympathies"" toward many hard right groups.   I had my eyes opened and started to dig into world finances and economics to find the way of other countries (reminder, this was during the crash) and compare it to our own. I'm amazed at how little people understand monetary expenditures, and how we (said as Americans) can even say ""small government"" with a straight face.   In a way, I kind of envy your position. With a bit of digging, a whole interesting body of knowledge is waiting to either support or challenge your beliefs.  Whether it's the Weimarer Republik or South Korea of the 1980s, there is so much to learn and understand through economics.   I enjoyed my travels through learning, but was dismayed about our (as a country) direction and lack of enlightenment about other country's trial and error of governance. So often we are spoon fed simple ""Capitalism vs Socialism"" garbage without any regard to the actual bills and legislature that is being created. It just supports the talking points of the groupies.   I hope you enjoy the ride, it's fun!"
wisconsin,3axwkn,Abzug,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:19:38 2015 UTC,"As with most people who actively follow politics, I am always learning a ton. But there are so many things wrong with today's politics that I don't think I (like many in my generation) can come to call themselves republicans. As I said, they don't have a message anymore. Establishment republicans and the tea party libertarians are nearly exact opposites, and there are so many stances within there. Even beyond that, the GOP has become a joke. It looks like they will be running like 30 candidates again, including yahoos like Donald Trump. The main media sources are Fox News, which is a joke- and conservative talk radio- which is mostly old guys complaining about Obama. The message is entirely lost. Which really makes politics a struggle for me, because I think there are some awesome messages within the party- but they all get buried in this circus called the GOP.  So instead, the Democrats will probably win another election, and our country will become increasingly liberal. We're almost to a place now where it's a 1-party system; not 2.  I'm just praying that a good candidate emerges out of this field. I have a lot of respect for Rand Paul. Beyond that, I haven't seen many decent candidates. But somebody who understands the economy and can still represent a capitalism side of things would have a vote locked in my opinion. I need somebody to really re-vitalize the party by taking the primaries and having a crystal clear relatable message.  Probably won't happen though."

The deck is in favor of the rich and yet, here we are, having this conversation. Something must not be working right?

First of all, Doyle was NOT even close to that pace. Doyle was negative job growth. Granted, a lot of that was due to the national recession. The last governor to come close to 250k jobs was Thompson. He created 230k or so in each of his first 2 terms.  Yes, I knew 250k wasn't going to happen. I was hopeful, sure. But realistically, coming out of a recession and still having annual job losses, I couldn't imagine hitting those numbers. But I knew he would have focus on it.  It's politics. Every politician is a liar. Every single one. When a politician says ""I'm going to eliminate the national debt and finish the war in Iraq,"" I know those things won't happen. Nobody is going to eliminate the national debt in 1 cycle. But I know there will be a focus, and they will lower the debt somewhat.  And he did. While I was working on my last job, they were given a tax break on new land and a new building that was going to help create a few thousand jobs. And he was doing that everywhere. Giving grants and breaks to companies that could help him achieve that goal. No democrat would ever do that.  Third party? What a joke. I'd vote for a libertarian if I knew a few a million or so of my closest friends were going to do the same, I'd consider that.  Actually, now that you mention it, I think I actually may have voted 3rd party. I may have voted for the other Burke, the libertarian. Because I remember thinking if we can get him to 5%, libertarians would get a seat in the next gub election."
wisconsin,3axwkn,BrewCrewKevin,8,Wed Jun 24 19:28:04 2015 UTC,"First of all, Doyle was NOT even close to that pace.   That's right, but I daresay Peanut is conflating the pace of actual job creation with the February 2010 projection of 125,500 additional private sector jobs from 2010 through 2012 (see appendix 1 on pdf page 23).  In terms of the pace under Doyle we added 33,658 private sector jobs in 2010, up 1.50% (and versus the national growth rate of 1.27% that year), while that percentage rate was only just eclipsed in 2014 with 1.51% (and versus the national growth rate of 2.57% that year).   Doyle was negative job growth.   Going by the 8 years December 2002 - December 2010, yes.   Granted, a lot of that was due to the national recession.   QCEW private sector jobs in Wisconsin dropped from 2,318,398 to 2,270,985 over this period, a drop of 2.05%.  During that time the national picture went from 108,213,787 to 107,644,196, a drop of 0.53%, some 1.52% better.  Over eight years that's (1.01520.125)-1 = 0.19%/year worse than the nation, on average.  In contrast, from December 2010 - December 2014, Wisconsin private sector jobs grew 5.69%, some 3.65% less than the nation's 9.34% or 0.90%/year worse.  If we'd had Doyle's 8-year average lag vs the nation over Walker's first term we'd have grown by 8.53% or 193,706 jobs instead of the 129,154 we had.  If we'd kept pace with the nation we'd be up 212,109.  If you want to add population growth into the mix, from 2002 to 2010 the US population (estimate) grew 7.55% while Wisconsin's grew 4.51%, i.e. we were being outpaced by 0.37%/year.  From 2010 to 2014 the US grew 3.07% and Wisconsin 1.20%, i.e. we were outpaced by 0.46%/year.  So in private sector jobs per population Wisconsin did better than the nation under Doyle in his two terms (and worse under Walker).  That's not a be-all-and-end-all because cause and effect isn't entirely clear: population is mobile and labor will tend to go to where the jobs are rather than concentrating where they aren't, but on the other hand without the population growth there's less demand/need for new jobs (in housing construction, if nothing else).  But if you accept Wisconsin's smaller population change as a factor in what expectations for job growth should be rather than being a consequence of lower job growth, then the net job loss under Doyle was more than entirely due to the Great Recession."
wisconsin,3axwkn,toasters_are_great,2,Wed Jun 24 21:37:52 2015 UTC,"For all the people who want to criticize Doyle for negative jobs growth or poor jobs growth,  you have to remember he was Governor during The Great Recession,  the second worst economic downturn in economic history,  second only to The Great Depression."
wisconsin,3axwkn,PeanutTheGladiator,2,Thu Jun 25 01:02:05 2015 UTC,"First of all, Doyle was NOT even close to that pace. Doyle was negative job growth. Granted, a lot of that was due to the national recession. The last governor to come close to 250k jobs was Thompson. He created 230k or so in each of his first 2 terms.   Doyle has nothing to do with this.  The report that Walker used said we were on track to create 125K jobs over the next 2 years, he doubled it for 250K.   Yes, I knew 250k wasn't going to happen. I was hopeful, sure. But realistically, coming out of a recession and still having annual job losses, I couldn't imagine hitting those numbers. But I knew he would have focus on it.   You voted for a guy you knew was lying to you.  I ... just can't.  Why vote if you're going to pick the guy you know will fuck you over?  Oh, right, that ""R"" after his name."

Oh, right, that ""R"" after his name.   That's so stupid though. Every politician lies. Every election. I don't know how to change that- I wish I did.  But the fact is, Mary Burke lies about just as much as Scott Walker does. So that's all out of the picture for me.  The deciding factor, at least for me, is that Walker at least had a vision for the state. He gave some goals, like his jobs goal. Mary Burke wouldn't say anything about what she wanted to change- she just ran on ""I'm not Walker."""
wisconsin,3axwkn,Thonlo,6,Wed Jun 24 20:44:51 2015 UTC,"The deciding factor, at least for me, is that Walker at least had a vision for the state.   Respectfully, that is absolutely ridiculous. Governor Walker's ""plan for the state"" has seen him repeatedly taking wealth from the public and redistributing it to his supporters and the upper class. It hasn't achieved his tattoos-on-forehead, 'the people should absolutely hold me accountable for this' jobs promise. He is embroiled in scandals that occurred right outside of his door for years but, oh, he didn't know about. He's on tape admitting to discussing the agents provocateurs in the Union protests which is immoral, corrupt, and treasonous.  Governor Walker has the state on lockdown with full control of our government and this is the best we can do? All of the shit happening now is what we get? I don't believe Governor Walker has a ""vision for the state"" other than another launching pad for his political ambitions.   But the fact is, Mary Burke lies about just as much as Scott Walker does.   That's not the fact though. She has 16 fewer ""mostly false"" and 33 fewer ""false"" ratings. That's a significant difference.   Mary Burke wouldn't say anything about what she wanted to change- she just ran on ""I'm not Walker.""   Fair enough -- but I guess ""I'm not corrupt, immoral, and scandalous"" was good enough for me given two options. I'm with /u/PeanutTheGladiator -- I don't know how people can vote for this guy. He embodies the opposite of the Wisconsin Idea ... I wonder why he wanted that language struck.  Actually no. No I don't."
wisconsin,3axwkn,BrewCrewKevin,-3,Wed Jun 24 21:44:22 2015 UTC,"I won't deny anything you've said about Walker. He's lied more times than I care for.  As far as his alternate router scandal and mentioning to the fake David Koch that he thought about planting protestors...  both of those seem to not have much to do with anything, really. Especially the protesters one.  She has 16 fewer and 33 fewer because she hasn't been in politics. Look at the percentages- they are pretty damn near identical. At least not a significant of a difference there to call Walker a liar and Burke not.  And if we're talking about jobs plans? Burke didn't know shit about job creation. She had a bullshit report written and published to check the box, but repeatedly could not give details. And with her record? She's never held down a job by herself. She moved to Europe to take over Trek and ran the business into the ground and was fired by her own father. And she was dishonest about that, too.  Not exactly the picture of job creation I wanted either. It's certainly not Walkers, but I wasn't about to vote Mary either."

What kind of person needs a discussion to decide not to simultaneously subvert our democracy, follow the law, and endanger their constituents? Gov. Walker apparently.  According to Politifact Burke lied in 38% of the investigated statements. Gov. Walker lied, and lied worse, in 49%. Quite a difference.  Let's talk about jobs plans. Where can I find Gov. Walkers?   Not exactly the picture of job creation I wanted either. It's certainly not Walkers, but I wasn't about to vote Mary either.

wisconsin,3axwkn,SinkHoleDeMayo,5,Wed Jun 24 21:42:15 2015 UTC,His first term was the US economy improving and Walker setting the stage for his massively failed second term. It's kind of like hiking up a hill with your buddy... so you can push him off a cliff.   The rest of the country improved economically at a quicker rate than WI. That's like saying you finished a race... but everyone else did too and you were the last to cross the finish line. Every state improved and WI was at the bottom of the barrel.   You should regret voting for him. Walker has been a tremendous fuck up. His first term set the stage for him to screw everything up. I live in MN and things are absolutely better. MN has been doing great and WI is a disaster.

Not saying Walker is good, but its a history of pretty awful overall...Wisconsin has had a horrible run since 2000 and hasnt really improved much under any combination of administration or legislature."
wisconsin,3axwkn,JacketKeeper,5,Wed Jun 24 14:19:47 2015 UTC,"I don't like Walker.  I also think his policies have been counter productive.  On the other hand, comparing Wisconsin to some of these other Midwest States is a poor comparison.    A huge contribution to the economic booms in Midwestern States is due to increased energy production and fracking.  I recently moved here from Ohio where there is a huge amount of fracking.  I strongly believe this a poor long-term choice and I am glad Wisconsin hasn't opened the floodgates yet.  The short term economic boom isn't worth the destruction of natural resources and public health.  That being said, I am sure Walker would be first in line to de-regulate energy speculation in Wisconsin.  I am not defending Walker.  This comparison is just not very effective between Wisconsin and some of its neighbors.  http://insideclimatenews.org/news/20150120/map-fracking-boom-state-state"
wisconsin,3axwkn,JacketKeeper,12,Wed Jun 24 13:57:08 2015 UTC,"I doubt fracking explains why Wisconsin finished last in 3 out of 4 years of Walker's first term, and second to last in the 4th. Doesn't wash.  Minnesota is doing much better than Wisconsin economically (and it used to be the opposite for many years) and it isn't because of fracking."
wisconsin,3axwkn,toasters_are_great,2,Wed Jun 24 14:05:47 2015 UTC,"I can't speak about Minnesota because I am not very familiar with their State's economy.  I can explain Ohio leap-frogging Wisconsin in that time frame.  Comparing Ohio and Wisconsin is a poor comparison on a surface level.  Ohio's spike in economic recovery is due to a combination of factors.  The energy boom and low cost oil/gas have boosted the states manufacturing base (which is on of the biggest in the nation).  The Utica shale drilling has created an explosion of dollars  into the eastern side of the state (at the cost of the environment).    Also, banking and financial services is a huge part of Ohio's economy and the recovery of these institutions due to the stock market rally post 2008 has spurred a lot of job growth.  There just isn't a simple 1:1 comparison with Ohio and Wisconsin.  Do I think Walker is helping economic development?  Absolutely not.  I just don't think 1:1 comparisons of job growth between states is an effective way to measure it.  Some of the job growth in these other states is due to economic booms in industries that are not well represented in Wisconsin's economy."
wisconsin,3axwkn,TheHairyFart,6,Wed Jun 24 14:19:38 2015 UTC,"The energy boom and low cost oil/gas have boosted the states manufacturing base (which is on of the biggest in the nation).    In absolute terms, that's true, but if you look at the current set of job figures, manufacturing is 690.7/(5,407.0-755.9) = 14.8% of Ohio's private sector job base as of May's preliminary figures, while Wisconsin's is 472.6/(2877.3-410.4) = 19.2%.  Or if you mean as regards Ohio's shale oil boomlet, that's been going on only in the last two years, and in 2014 19 million barrels of production at about $94 is only about 0.3% of Ohio's GDP.  Not to be sniffed at, but hardly earth-shattering (no pun intended).   Also, banking and financial services is a huge part of Ohio's economy    The financial activities sector accounts for 6.3% of private sector jobs in Ohio, 6.2% in Wisconsin (see links above).   There just isn't a simple 1:1 comparison with Ohio and Wisconsin. Do I think Walker is helping economic development? Absolutely not. I just don't think 1:1 comparisons of job growth between states is an effective way to measure it. Some of the job growth in these other states is due to economic booms in industries that are not well represented in Wisconsin's economy.   No, but what they lack in exact 1:1 correlation as a measure they make up for in simplicity.  But this could be your lucky day: by looking at the sector breakdown of national job growth, we can create a 'virtual state' that has the same percentage sector breakdown as Wisconsin, only with the sector-by-sector growth rates of the nation.  Its private sector grew 71,303 more than Wisconsin's from 2011-14 (if you just do a what-if-WI's-private-sector-grew-at-US-as-a-whole-rates comparison, we missed out on 70,488 jobs).  So in net there's not a great difference to be had (at least, not in Walker's first term) by looking at the sector-by-sector level."

wisconsin,3axwkn,SinkHoleDeMayo,0,Thu Jun 25 01:12:49 2015 UTC,"Minnesota has, and has had, a lot more Fortune 500 companies than Wisconsin (18 vs. our 10,) for a time well predating Walker. That helps them, a lot. Even if we copied exactly what Minnesota is doing, we're 8 huge companies behind them from a starting point. We're not going to climb to that level overnight."
wisconsin,3axwkn,PeanutTheGladiator,6,Wed Jun 24 14:51:13 2015 UTC,But we WERE ahead of them for years and years and years.  These 8 Fortune 500 companies didn't just sprout up during the recession; they were they prior to the recession and well into the times that Wisconsin was cleaning Minnesota's clock.
wisconsin,3axwkn,ForGondor,6,Wed Jun 24 19:05:46 2015 UTC,Yep. Then the states switched policies. MN went liberal and WI went full conservative retard. We ended up with the usual predictable results. MN ends up doing well and WI goes for a nose dive.

wisconsin,3axwkn,cbarrister,10,Wed Jun 24 17:50:27 2015 UTC,"Wisconsin has also benefited from the fracking boom as well. You know that sand they use for Wells to blast in the shale? The lion's share of that actually comes from Wisconsin. It is not really an issue, and actually comparing Midwestern States is a better teller than most because of the decline of Midwestern manufacturing as a whole. Each state in the Midwest has seen this happen, and Wisconsin relies too heavily on old style manufacturing jobs directly linking a lack of job gains with poor policy promoting manufacturers as if that is going to stop the tide.  Wisconsin is very unique in one way, and that's the paper industry, which has seen a steady decline as well.  EDIT: Spelling things"

wisconsin,3ay8xx,verbete,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"Taking my lunch break to get in on this.  That is a really interesting study, and I think it mostly shows that murder and suicide rates are not dependent upon weapon availability, they are mostly a social problem.   Correlation without causation however means NOTHING but something to think about and possibly research further. Here is a website full of spurious correlations that obviously have no relationship to each other but the numbers sure do correlate well. The study does not say that more guns reduce murder rates, it simply says the data correlates.  The study also talked about people who commit murders being habitual criminals.  Regular law-abiding folk are not the murderers.  Reducing the number of guns in society wouldn't do anything to reduce murders, but it gives an excellent argument for background checks to make it harder for criminals to get guns.  Will it prevent criminals from getting guns ever? No, but it's a simple step, especially with today's technology that should be required. I'm in agreement with Governor Walker here that the 48 hour limit probably isn't necessary, especially when you look at the study saying murder rates are not impacted by the choice of weapons you have.  The one thing that reducing gun availability may impact is mass shootings.  Guns are a successful weapon because they are very efficient.  They let you attack from a distance, keeping you safer, have a very damaging effect compared to other weapons, and allow you to attack a large number of people very quickly. Australia is a good example of a gun ban eliminating mass shootings.  The issue we need to resolve is if we are willing to accept mass shootings as a cost of our country's gun availability.  As for allowing off duty or retired officers to carry in schools I don't think it will have much of an impact. As a father of two kids I am against guns in schools but this won't have much of an effect either way.  The chance of a crazed gunman coming into the school and shooting the place up AND an officer there to stop it are so low they are not worthy of being considered.  The chance a retired officer working as a school security guard falls asleep at work and a kid sneaks up and takes his gun because it's cool is a bigger concern of mine, but the chances that anyone would then get shot are also very slim."

The same study found that the Democratic Republic of the Congo's rate was 5.2 and Pakistan's was only 3.7. The ability for every individual, regardless of disposition to have such criminally easy access to firearms has by no means diminished the homicide rate. It is also easy to argue that ""gun rights"" have facilitated for an our higher rates.  The statistics I used in my opening argument are below.

I would take a thoughtful point with cited sources if that was the focus. I don't see the sense in restricting rights in order to shift the types of murder weapons used in our country. Western European countries have a long tradition of restricting arms access from their subjects. Even if restricting American gun rights was on the table, how would you propose we do that? Confiscation? There won't be a voluntary disarmament in this country."
wisconsin,3ay8xx,cs556,5,Thu Jun 25 00:46:45 2015 UTC,"I am so concerned with firearm related homicides for a number of reasons: 1)-there is such a discrepancy in their rates when compared to comparable nations in Europe. 2)-as a nation we seem to be infatuated with guns and there is truly not a need for them amongst the general populace (at least at their current levels). My information comes from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation based on data as of 2010 (albeit slightly dated). This right that you refer to holds very little tangible benefits. What do you gain by owning firearms? It is an aphrodisiac, a symbol of power. If you use a weapon for hunting, I have no issue with that. You also brought up european countries restricting weaponry to limit their citizens power. Certainly a valid point in the 1700-1800s. However, in the contemporary world, it holds no bearing. Perhaps their roads to a more democratic society were different then ours, but that does not diminish modern statistics concerning gun crimes. As to the topic of limiting firearms, there are a number of options. All registered firearm owners would receive compensation for their weaponry (this would not have to include handguns or hunting equipment). Regulating weapons manufacturers to be more accountable for the use of their products would force more stringent background checks and waiting periods will reduce the amount of weapons getting into the hands of criminal elements.  My opinion is this: The solution is never less control over weaponry. The gun is a symbol of power, it is an aphrodisiac, and it is completely unnecessary. i constantly hear that i will never voluntarily disarm, why? Why do you need a gun? What are you gaining by owning one? The second amendment was written for the 18th and 19th century, when absolutism reigned and we would have to possibly defend against interlopers seeking to end our experiment into republicanism. It was also to ensure a monarch did not arise domestically. Modern European citizens have proven that even without easy access to firearms republican and democratic ideas will not be snuffed out."

So we all have to be equally powerful and guns are one tool that accomplishes that in an efficient and effective manner.    All registered firearm owners would receive compensation for their weaponry   Which again, was never the point. Guns are worth much much more than their material value.    stringent background checks   The people you don't want to have guns never have to worry about that.    The solution is never less control over weaponry   Except gun laws are not control. They only apply to the lawful, the very same people you have no problem owning guns.

Wind in Germany is connected to transmission lines but also is distributed generation, like our residential solar, they have success with much smaller wind farms because of this. (Plus off shore generation from huge turbines, of course.)  That said, there is no shortage of renewable capacity in Wisconsin."

Instead, here in Wisconsin, we have people traveling 10 under, the speed limit, 10 over, 20 over, all trying to share the same fucking road.  That's where the problem is, not the fact that someone does 60-65 in a 55...because almost everyone is doing 60-65 in a 55.  TRAVEL LANE...PASSING LANE.

Speed itself isn't dangerous, the technology makes it easy and predictable.   What they do during these track days is split the drivers into groups, beginner, intermediate and advanced. Because it's when you have the large variations in speed that you have the most accidents. Beginners are unpredictable and when you have huge closing speeds it just doesn't work, an accident WILL happen. This is what you're talking about above ticketing the slower drivers. They cause the anger that causes the accidents.   So what we've got on our public roads is like a track day but where all groups are mixed. It only takes one driver to slow down hundreds of people. They have a right to use the roadways but do they have the right to impede everyone behind them?  What is needed is much tighter regulation and possibly a tiered licensing system. Fast lane is only for people with the tougher driving licenses. You start out with a slow-lane only license. But that would never be put in place because local governments don't care about safety, only shaking you down for fines. If they really did care about safety they would radically change the laws."

There was a caravan of cars behind this guy that was over a dozen cars long.  Where my mom lives in Alaska they get lots of people in RVs doing the same shit and it's actually legally required for people to pull off the road and allow people past them if there are more than a few cars stuck behind them.    But too many people up here really seem to just not give a single solitary fuck if they hold everyone else up for some reason.  I've never experienced anything like it in all my years as an Army brat moving from place to place.  It's a uniquely upper-Midwest thing and it drives me batty."

But that's definitively not what you said in your previous comment:   53 in a 55   You're sure this isn't anything other than an improperly-calibrated speedometer?  My last car, it read 7% low."
wisconsin,3au6g2,toasters_are_great,4,Wed Jun 24 00:25:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, 5-10 under the general flow of traffic, then.  If traffic is stacking up behind someone, there's a problem.  It needs to be addressed.  I don't care that people want to drive slow...I care that they refuse to yield to the general flow of traffic.  How many times do you pass someone on the right up here?  I probably do it a dozen times a day on my daily commute.  The shit is obnoxious and definitely causes traffic problems and needs to be addressed.  Speed limits are merely a part of the equation but, then again, the general speed with which the majority of traffic flows is where the limit should be placed, anyway.    But either way, the speed with which a person is traveling is far less important than encouraging a steady flow of traffic.  Picking off that one guy doing 20 over is great, but most people aren't.  When's the last time you heard of someone getting pulled over for going too slow and holding up traffic?  It can literally cause just as many accidents to travel significantly below the general speed of traffic than over it.  As for my speedometer, I couldn't tell you, but my car is two years old and doesn't seem to be reading slow.  Based on the speed it reads when I match the general flow of traffic, I'd say it's probably okay.  I figure most people hover around 5-10 over at highway speeds and my speedometer reads about the same."

I don't care that people want to drive slow...I care that they refuse to yield to the general flow of traffic.   If someone isn't doing the limit and backing up traffic on a 2-lane road, then they really ought to pull over periodically as a common courtesy if nothing else.  On the other hand, if they are doing the limit and traffic is backing up behind them, do they owe the train of would-be lawbreakers the opportunity to break the law?  Might be a good idea for them - someone making an idiot overtaking maneuver and smashing into an oncoming vehicle just a few yards ahead of them is not a good situation to be in, regardless of the reasons why - but I couldn't fault them for the illegal behavior of others.   How many times do you pass someone on the right up here?   I'd have to say, pretty rarely.  But I am up north and it's uncommon that I see traffic densities particularly high on divided highways.   Speed limits are merely a part of the equation but, then again, the general speed with which the majority of traffic flows is where the limit should be placed, anyway.   Then we should ditch speed limits and make driving at high speed differentials to the general flow the principal speed-related offense (on an empty road it'd still be possible to drive dangerously fast, notably such that your stopping distance is further than you can see).   As for my speedometer, I couldn't tell you, but my car is two years old and doesn't seem to be reading slow   I just sometimes wonder when I see people driving a little under or a little over the limit whether it's just that their speedometer is a touch off.  My current car (which is recent in its manufacture), its speedometer gives exactly the same numbers as the GPS readings called out by Mrs Toasters in the passenger seat."

wisconsin,3au6g2,RonDiaz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:53:06 2015 UTC,"Here are some interesting numbers that came up with the news about the bill:   AAA Wisconsin has argued that the speed limit should not be changed in Wisconsin, particularly for heavy trucks, because an increase of 5 mph could lengthen the stopping distance for those vehicles by as much as 100 feet, or 20%. The motorists group cites federal data showing that large trucks were involved in 7.4% of fatal crashes in Wisconsin in 2012, while Minnesota and Iowa - which allow trucks to travel 70 mph on rural highways - had rates of 10% and 13.2%, respectively.   Some states have a lower speed limit for large and heavy vehicles, but it looks like the effects of that on safety are inconclusive."

I think most people learn from this shit, I know he has. I know other friends have just from witnessing what he's had to deal with.   sure you hear about the guy with 8th DUI every once in a while but you know what, there isn't any law that's going to stop a moron like that from drinking and driving.     seriously if you think our laws aren't harsh enough or you don't like WI's drinking culture then go live somewhere safer. fuck, this state sucks ass these days any way."

wisconsin,3ar3b8,TheHairyFart,10,Mon Jun 22 21:56:11 2015 UTC,"And i like that trend.  Normally, I'd think it was kind-of stupid to donate it to a church. But given the context, this is the biggest kick-in-the-ass they could have given this white supremacy group. So good on 'em."
wisconsin,3ar3b8,BrewCrewKevin,0,Mon Jun 22 22:35:33 2015 UTC,"That's not the point. The point is that Walker shares the ideals of the person who donated the money, so much that Holt wanted Walker in office and was willing to help get him there. Donating the money is one thing, but lets not forget why its in his pocket in the first place."
wisconsin,3ar3b8,Kariston,5,Tue Jun 23 13:19:00 2015 UTC,"He donated to several conservative politicians, and gave more to Cruz than to Walker. From my understanding, and I could be wrong here, Holt isn't actually individually known for any racist statements or personally held racist beliefs. It could be that he likes Walker because of the business with Act 10. It's the main thing he's known for outside of Wisconsin, afterall.  I'm not trying to, nor do I want to defend any potential racism. I'm just pointing out that Walker did the right thing with the money. If he had accepted, kept, and campaigned with it, it'd be a totally different situation."
wisconsin,3ar3b8,TheHairyFart,2,Tue Jun 23 13:57:36 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, and I could be wrong here, Holt isn't actually individually known for any racist statements or personally held racist beliefs.   I'm afraid you're quite wrong here -   ...despite Holt’s many donations to Republicans, he seemed none too pleased with the party when the Republican National Committee announced plans in 2013 to increase its minority outreach. “Other than profoundly endanger many canvassers by sending potential victims into increasingly dangerous ‘hoods’ and barrios,” he wrote on the organization’s Web site, “this ridiculous program will achieve nothing beyond perpetuating the RNC’s established practice of squandering and misspending funds donated in good faith by its party faithful.”  He was also upset, he said, that “the current RNC leadership seem particularly susceptible to what are often opportunistic and mercenary blacks feigning allegiance to GOP principles in order to benefit themselves in some manner.” That’s why, he said, he and his wife, “refuse to contribute to the RNC.”...  “I never dreamed,” he wrote, “that even a nation of dolts, gamblers, borrowers and personal injury plaintiffs would elect a phony nigro with three Moslem names and a Marxist agenda, no matter how much nigro voter fraud occurred on Election Day.”...  Holt, 62, grew up in St. Louis, where he graduated from Washington University, Riverfront Times reported in 2003. He stepped into the public eye in 1989 when he ran for a seat on the St. Louis School Board, joining others who had ties to the Council of Conservative Citizens in the fight against court-ordered busing for school desegregation, according to St. Louis Public Radio.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/23/meet-earl-holt-whose-supremacist-site-influenced-alleged-charleston-church-killer-dylann-roof/"

wisconsin,3ar3b8,wonderfunk99,26,Tue Jun 23 14:10:14 2015 UTC,"When your party shows open disdain for those that are gay, black, and Jewish you mean to tell me it attracts racists?  No shit.  They have been the party of cloaked racism for over 40 years now.   Questioner: But the fact is, isn't it, that Reagan does get to the Wallace voter and to the racist side of the Wallace voter by doing away with legal services, by cutting down on food stamps?  Atwater: You start out in 1954 by saying, ""Nigger, nigger, nigger."" By 1968 you can't say ""nigger"" — that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me — because obviously sitting around saying, ""We want to cut this,"" is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than ""Nigger, nigger.""   Voter ID was passed using this strategy."
wisconsin,3ar3b8,mst3kcrow,8,Mon Jun 22 21:33:46 2015 UTC,"Glad the way our culture is steering, that for someone to accept a donation from such people would be career-damaging.  I want to say good on Walker for donating it.  What does it say, though, about your persona, party, and the people you surround yourself with, that people like these will throw their financial support behind you?"
wisconsin,3ar3b8,no_soul_ginger,8,Tue Jun 23 02:28:57 2015 UTC,"Look out with that logic. I would imagine that some black supremacy groups have probably donated to Democrats at some point. Plenty of other questionable interests have donated to both major and many third parties, too. The knife cuts both ways on this. It's better to just ignore it unless a politician keeps the questionable money or supports their views somehow. Yet another reason why we need state funding of elections, in my mind."
wisconsin,3ar3b8,TheHairyFart,4,Tue Jun 23 04:47:43 2015 UTC,"Agree about public funding.  I chose the language of my statement carefully, because I know it goes both ways...however there haven't been groups as such donating to nearly every supposed candidate.  To treat it the same on both sides without looking at the evidence is a false equivalence."
wisconsin,3ar3b8,no_soul_ginger,0,Tue Jun 23 12:46:48 2015 UTC,"One thing to consider, though. When the bulk of your field is white Christian men, it's going to be easier to spread money around from groups that believe white Christian men are superior. Even in the Democratic Party, the bulk of the candidates are white men, though they don't play up the religion half as much as conservatives do. If every Democrat was a black man, it'd be easier for black supremacists to spread their money around.   Something tells me the KKK wasn't funneling large sums of cash into Herman Cain. Black supremacy groups aren't about to donate to Al Gore, John Kerry, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, etc. Some of them might get support from extremists of other sorts, though. Hillary will likely get some radical feminist donors, and Bernie will probably have a few non-peaceful socialists/communists. Radical environmentalists (the kind that physically sabotage construction and industrial sites) are probably not going to be supporting many Republicans. Does this mean that Democrats want to blow up fossil fuel processing facilities?  I am not trying to defend racism or racists. I'm just saying that this kind of stuff can come back around. If you're okay with people saying Walker is racist because a few donors are racist, then realize that that's the same line of logic that will lead to conservatives saying Hillary wants to hurt men and Sanders wants to completely subvert our democratic system."
wisconsin,3ar3b8,TheHairyFart,3,Tue Jun 23 14:15:12 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not saying Walker himself is a confederate flag waving ignoramus - only speaking to how prevalent the racist elements are in the conservative ""movement"", which doesn't have a mirror in the liberal or progressive ends.  Even the donor's group calls themselves conservatives, and it's not like the SLPC has an exponentially growing file on left-wing hate groups in the U.S...this isn't an issue that has balance on both sides."
wisconsin,3ar3b8,no_soul_ginger,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:45:38 2015 UTC,I wish more people on this thread understood this. Many politicians have questionable people donating or supporting them. It does not mean the pol  agrees with them. I can think of prominent Dems who have this same problem.
wisconsin,3ar3b8,chitwin,4,Wed Jun 24 18:56:44 2015 UTC,Seems like a pattern that white supremacists donate to republicans.

wisconsin,3ar3b8,MSACCESS4EVA,7,Mon Jun 22 21:48:50 2015 UTC,"I think what /u/karmartyr is annoyed by is how it's being used here to fling mud at Walker by association. It shouldn't be a headline. The whole story:   Walker among several conservative politicians who received small personal donations from the president of a conservative coalition with some racist stances, which was mentioned in a recent mass murderer's manifesto. He is now donating it to the church where the mass murder occurred.   Given the political lean of this sub in general, it should be no surprise that it A) labels Earl as simply a ""White Supremacist"", B) makes it sound like a closer tie than it really is, C) ignores the fact that he is returning it... it's pretty shitty journalism."
wisconsin,3ar3b8,BrewCrewKevin,6,Mon Jun 22 22:57:13 2015 UTC,"The title is fine. It's not so much that Walker received money from this one individual, it's that republican politicians attract donations from bigots because their policies are bigoted. Often, so are their supporters."
wisconsin,3ar3b8,ultra242,-6,Tue Jun 23 00:37:14 2015 UTC,"That's not a fair association. The policies are not bigoted. That's a liberal rhetoric. The reasoning for policies like limited immigration, cuts to entitlement programs, and voter ID laws are not specifically to target african americans. It's just a fair society with no special privilege for any one demographic.  While liberals (most of Reddit) favor policies that favor the poor in an effort to help them out, conservatives favor policies that don't favor anybody. It doesn't try to help everybody, because it's based on the realization that there will always be an underclass, and that's just the way it is. But that doesn't mean society should embrace it. Society should embrace and reward those who are successful.  It's really a shame that African Americans tend to fall into the lower classes of our socioeconomic system. But that doesn't mean that conservative policies are targeting them specifically."
wisconsin,3ar3b8,BrewCrewKevin,9,Tue Jun 23 01:10:13 2015 UTC,"As a liberal guy, I view conservative policies as ones that maintain the status quo by not giving special policies for anyone, thus locking in those in authoritative positions. Instead of proving their worth, they would rather legislate it.   It feels like ""The Greatest Generation"" created the most powerful middle class the world has ever seen.   The ""Me"" generation not only pissed that success away, but has borrowed from future generations with the belief that their personal betterment is the only concern.   That's why Reddit leans so liberal. We've seen economic turmoil, the stalling of the middle class, and the dream of stable lives disappear into the ether while some politician states that government doesn't work and fucks us long and hard to prove it. We've seen promises of small government pinned up everywhere while the economy free falls and politicians point and say ""we told you government sucks"".  What do we get for our beliefs in our limited government? Not a fucking thing. We get ""we don't favor anyone"" because those people have what they want, power and influence. Why rock the boat?   The conservative movement gave the Democratic party a voter for life, and I always vote. God, what ever happened to the Republican party?"

""In doing so, he is introducing himself to voters as a product of the Reagan Revolution. He is also trading on Reagan’s legacy while his own stature as a national figure is still uncertain.""  I will keep posting it so long as people are in denial about the cloaked racism and the policies thereof the RNC pushes; drug war, prison privatization, voter ID laws.   We get it you think conservatives are racist.   No, you don't and that's not what I said.

wisconsin,3ar3b8,chitwin,-6,Thu Jun 25 18:15:10 2015 UTC,"I absolutely hate that quote, and how much I see it around yet. It's what some guy said in the 60s about the ""southern stragegy"" during the civil rights movement or shortly thereafter. I believe it has little to no bearing on today's society.  As a conservative, I can tell you the motivation to cut entitlement programs is NOT race-driven. More accurately, it may be class driven. If you ask a conservative why they don't want entitlement programs, you will get an answer closer to ""I don't think it's the government's job, nor is it a fair use of my hard-earned tax dollars, to support people who fail to take responsibility for their own actions. While some social assistance is needed, I'm not interested in supporting a single-mother of three because of her irresponsible behavior."" Nobody in the right mind is going to say ""Because I'm not interested in helping blacks."" It just doesn't work like that any-more.  And the rhetoric of the bigoted GOP is a ploy by the liberals to paint their policies in the worst light possible, and it's bullshit. It really makes me mad that I can't even argue against entitlement programs without having racism brought up- despite the fact I'm making no link between African Americans and entitlement beneficiaries."
wisconsin,3ar3b8,BrewCrewKevin,8,Tue Jun 23 13:53:05 2015 UTC,"It's what some guy said in the 60s about the ""southern stragegy"" during the civil rights movement or shortly thereafter.

wisconsin,3ar3b8,BrewCrewKevin,7,Tue Jun 23 14:44:15 2015 UTC,"The point he was making wasn't necessarily that Republicans actually want to destroy and re-enslave African Americans, but rather heavily imply it for the sole purpose to get southern white votes...

wisconsin,3ar3b8,BrewCrewKevin,0,Tue Jun 23 14:38:34 2015 UTC,"Recognize that we haven’t solved racism. Now, is it really that hard to believe that racism functions through liberal economic means? As someone with leanings toward anarcho-communism, I'm more anti-liberal than the vast majority and I think it's important that this next part needs to be pointed out:  When you follow an ideology, you're not required to make adjustments for how policies work out in practice because your beliefs are based in a world that does not actually exist. Following any particular political theory on the other hand would make it necessary to react to the consequences those policies have in the real world.  But I recognize that very few people will be receptive to a challenge to their worldview—much less from me, being on the fringe, to say the least—because it’s more or less felt as an attack on oneself, so I would be shocked if anything anyone said to you here plants the kernel of doubt regarding your ideology."

wisconsin,3ar3b8,MSACCESS4EVA,-2,Tue Jun 23 14:15:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he is. But to my understanding, the donations came from Earl as a personal donation. There would be no way for Republicans to know who they are receiving the donations from or what the potential ties may be. I'm just saying they make it sound like they are dealing directly with white supremacists. Again, it just makes it sound closer than it is. The headline states that a white supremacist donated to Walker's campaign. Which is true. But it ignores that it was a personal donation, from a man who has ties to a vaguely-named coalition that appears to have a racist agenda, that a murderer was not really all that involved with, but mentioned in a manifesto to be inspired by. Yes, he's donating to the church where the shooting occured. My mistake.   I'm saying it's ""poor journalism"" because it shouldn't be a story. To me, at least, it says nothing of Walker's character. But the article is poised to attack Walker's character. He received a donation from an individual- that's all he did. It doesn't implicate him or the GOP as a white supremacist group like you seem to be implying.  I don't know of any, but I'll bet if there was a black supremacy group, they would be donating to the democratic party. The motive of the group doesn't imply the motive of the politician."

But only that quote from One Wisconsin Now, is the only part of the article condemning walker, and then, they're just calling on him to ditch that money, which he did.  The article itself doesn't imply any coordination between the group and Republicans, only that this group donated to many many republicans, including Walker.   you seem to be implying.   Nope."

I'm not surprised, but I'd like to better understand why this is such a terrible thing. It says in the article it's meant to speed up the process, and it really just means the DNR is making water decisions, rather than the county. I guess I would consider the DNR to be the experts at this sort of thing... not the county. Am I wrong?  Sounds like it has pretty big support throughout the construction industry. Is there really a down-side, besides on principle that these people donated to the GOP?"
wisconsin,3aoudi,BrewCrewKevin,8,Mon Jun 22 18:52:31 2015 UTC,"Like you identified, currently (water pun!), the DNR does an assessment, then the county does, so it's actually bypassing the county-level review, not completely abandoning all water quality assessments. It's streamlining (another one!) things and, if we had a more science-focused DNR, I doubt Madisonians would be losing much sleep over it.  I think a big part of the fear is that, since the DNR isn't exactly being run the same way it was under Doyle, they'll fast track certain developments that might end up wrecking the lakes, which would in turn cost Madison a lot of beauty, economic power, and clean drinking water in the name of a few hundred jobs from a plant whose owner just happens to support Walker financially.  It's either that or people are worried Walker is putting mind control chemicals in the water supply so he can win the presidency thanks to Wisconsin's electoral college votes and get back to work on that Final Solution to the Jewish Union Problem."
wisconsin,3aoudi,TheHairyFart,-1,Mon Jun 22 19:04:53 2015 UTC,"Very nice answer. And beautiful pun-manship.  That's about what I thought. It seems anything Walker has a hand in gets a pessimistic view from the get-go. Before it even gets a fair shot sometimes.  To me, this really does seem like it just streamlines the process. But right away, /wisconsin jumps on the bandwagon assuming Walker is out to ruin our state. Jesus, you may not agree with him, but to say he's out to cause destruction is pretty stupid.  I'm alright testing the waters (BOOM) on this one before i pass judgement on it. There may not be any foul play here."
wisconsin,3aoudi,BrewCrewKevin,5,Mon Jun 22 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"Well, there's still an issue here.  Madison and Dane Co. have stricter controls on water.  There's a serious issue with water quality in the lakes surrounding Madison.  The State regs aren't really suited to deal with a situation with such a large amount of population adjacent to lakes like these.  The algea blooms and bacteria issues can be quite severe and make the lakes basically unusable.  My last employer kept emailing the company about all these court wins where farmers were allowed to continue fertilizing and dumping waste on fields that were adjacent to streams.  No one thought it was a good idea, but because it wasn't illegal the farmers kept doing it.  When various local municipalities tries to stop it, there was some legislation passed to prevent them from having authority.  What's worse, is this is underminding the way our structure of government is supposed to work.  Dane Co should be able to pass stricter rules for water use because it's unique, and rules written for the entire state might not be adequate to address the issues here.  It's a political giveaway, pure and simple.  Just as is the removal of Dane Co's ability to apply zoning laws to the Hill Farm development."
wisconsin,3aoudi,waubers,3,Tue Jun 23 13:56:31 2015 UTC,"The Madison lakes have had a lot of problems with toxic algae blooms caused mostly by rain water runoff from area farms, and less often, construction sites. DNR regulations don't address this, and the law prevents the DNR from specifically addressing it using their new found authority.   A significant part of Madison's economy depends on clean-ish lakes and Dane county has taken steps to help farmers prevent unwanted runoff and avoid construction practices that would contribute as well. This has lead to several construction companies to donate heavily to Marklein with the understanding they don't like Dane's attempt to clean up the lakes impacting their business.   This bill is the result of those campaign contributions. It takes authority away from Dane county from being able to fix a significant problem and threat to its long term economy, and prevents the DNR from addressing this specific problem as well. All so a few construction companies can avoid some red tape.   If those affected can gather the funds to mount a legal opposition, I can't imagine this law will be upheld."

Fuck off somewhere else.  At least it's heartening to see 'fiscal conservatives' actually keep in line with their ideology, instead of running in circles trying to say why, even though government shouldn't be in the business of spending money to help people, it should be in the business of building arenas.  editing twice because I just get more livid as I keep thinking about it. This isn't even like the government loaning the money with low- or no-interest loans, so that we could say we're just helping them get financing (even though that would still cost taxpayers money, ultimately). This is just straight-up 'here's $250 million enjoy and have fun!!' to people who have literally BILLIONS to their name. We don't get paid back, we don't get a cut of the profits, we only get vague promises that maybe, hopefully, the arena will spur spending which will generate taxes.   Fuck the Bucks.

wisconsin,3aemhj,PeanutTheGladiator,3,Sat Jun 20 01:07:50 2015 UTC,Taxes and fees pay for about half of all road funding. The rest comes from borrowing and the general fund aka subsidizing.

The people who are paying for roads are...all of us.  You wouldn't ride a train.  That's fine.  I'd rather not have to drive everywhere.  We both pay our taxes - I'm assuming you do, muttering to yourself about government theft while you drop the envelope in the mail - so why is one funded unquestioningly, and the other Marxism?"

wisconsin,3aeh9d,Abzug,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:09:44 2015 UTC,I am curious what percentage of the opiate abuse is for PTSD.  You could move or start a VA onto a reservation and have some (quasi?) legal means by which to treat it with an alternative substance.
wisconsin,3aeh9d,mst3kcrow,2,Sat Jun 20 06:42:49 2015 UTC,"My dad uses the VA and his stories are pretty frightening about some of the young folks that are there.   There are alot of folks that got seriously injured because of the IEDs and non conventional warfare that they went up against in the second Iraq war.   We tend to think about Vietnam as the war that crippled and maimed people, but due to unconventional nature of the war, this last action was pretty rough.   When dealing with long term pain management, there's always a concern about opioid addiction and escalation of treatment because opioids typically fall off in effectiveness in long term situations. You're spot on with a concern for PTSD when standard treatment (normal patients) can easily lead to addiction and you have folks coming in with PTSD concerns.   Couple that with a high workload, and doctors can easily get compliant (or simply overlook) an issue like dependence.   It's a no-win situation, as far as I'm aware. There's higher need for quality medical care for the VA at a time when funding is being restricted at a federal level. Firing doctors isn't a way to win more practitioners in the system."

wisconsin,3afgja,birlik54,4,Sat Jun 20 00:39:40 2015 UTC,"Except the $6.5 million is the money that is brought in currently from the taxes paid by every player who plays in the state. And that's just now, with the new NBA TV deal kicking in player contracts will rise by a good amount. This will far surpass the state contribution of $4 million per year. If the team leaves there's no way to get that tax money back and it would leave a hole in the budget.  The $6.5 million figure has nothing to do with anything but player taxes. That money is guaranteed unless the team leaves."
wisconsin,3afgja,LordSunkist,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:21:30 2015 UTC,I will agree that in general adding a new stadium into area that had not had one before doesn't do much if anything to enhance local economies. That being said I would think that the addition of the stadium to that part of the city would increase the real estate value immensely.
