editors,3e68ml,layzworm,10,Wed Jul 22 07:20:55 2015 UTC,What's going on there? Are two of the judges appearing from another location by chroma key?
editors,3e68ml,napoleon_wilson,17,Wed Jul 22 08:15:42 2015 UTC,Not really a chroma. Looks like reality TV editing. They masked over reactions of the other two judges in order to alter the shows tone. Very common in reality editing. There's even a dramatic jump cut in the two judges. Someone didn't quite watch the final edit...
editors,3e68ml,Kalcaman,6,Wed Jul 22 08:25:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks I never knew that kind of thing went on. Fascinating. So essentially if they want a positive response they can mask in judges reacting a certain way?"
editors,3e68ml,napoleon_wilson,9,Wed Jul 22 09:53:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, they also will intercut reactions in reality TV that in actuality were not in response to the action, just to tweak the story.

If I was you I'd just sort out a good backup solution, if you don't need the read performance increase that RAID 1 would give you I just don't think it's worth it. RAID is really meant for situations where you need to keep the system up whilst disks are replaced.

editors,3e6suu,Kichigai,1 point,Wed Jul 22 16:44:52 2015 UTC,"One possibility is setting up Windows Shadow Copy (called File History in 8+) on your 3TB drive. This will incur a bit of an overhead, though, but it also means that if something happens, like a corrupt file, you can roll it back to a good version, assuming your backup drive had enough space to keep it.  A hardware RAID1 setup would work too, but without file versioning. Basically what happens in a RAID1 is that data is written to both disks at the same time, and read from both disks at the same time. You don't get a bump in write speed (you may even take a small hit, depending on the specifics) but you can get a bump in read speeds. If one disk fails then you're pretty much working off just one disk, which can operate all on its own, until you insert a new disk and the array ""heals"" itself by cloning the first drive over.  If you're going to be serious about doing a RAID setup make sure you buy all your disks from different vendors, even if that isn't the cheapest solution. The idea is that if there's a manufacturing defect in one disk that causes premature failure then you have better odds that the same defect won't be present in the other disk as they should have come from different manufacturing batches. You should also always keep a spare disk on hand to swap in when (not if) disk failure occurs."

I'm fairly new at the assistant position and learning as I go. We have Mpeg Streamclip, toast titanium, cinema tools, compressor, cyberduck, fetch, all of adobe creative suite and final cut 7. Sorry if some of these don't even relate to this issue."
editors,3e4fij,Kichigai,5,Tue Jul 21 22:12:28 2015 UTC,"Okie doke, well, here's the good news, you've got what we need, and then some.  I'd feed this clip through Compressor, since it has a good scaler in there that should make this look better in an HD project. Make a new Preset in there for Quicktime Movie, and set the codec to Avid DNxHD.  Now, we need to know what the frame rate is in this clip. Avid generally does a much better job converting frame rates, so I'd suggest to leave it alone if you can. From there choose the resolution that matches your project and the frame rate that matches your clip. If the frame rate isn't there match it to the nearest multiple (24p for 12FPS or 8FPS source, for example). Don't bother with 10-bit color, cell phones only shoot 8-bit. Keep your color levels at 709, and don't use an Alpha channel. There's no transparency to preserve here.  Under audio go with Linear PCM, using a Recommended sample rate, stereo audio, and 16 or 24 bit sample size (whatever your Avid project is set to).  Then go over to the next tab and turn your Frame Controls on. Your Resize Filter should be set for Best, Output Fields to Progressive, and Deinterlacing to Fast (don't worry, it won't do anything on a progressive clip). Your Rate Conversion should be Nearest Frame.  Leave the filters alone and go straight to Geometry. Leave the Crop alone, but make sure the Dimensions match the resolution chosen for Avid. Under Output Image, set the Padding to ""Preserve source aspect ratio.""  Submit the job. It'll kick out DNxHD in a MOV file which you can Fast Import or do an AMA/Consolidate on.  You could do this in Streamclip, but Compressor has a better scaler and more control options. You could probably do it in Adobe Media Encoder, but if your source file has a variable frame rate it'll cause some issues in there. That's why I think Compressor is the best option here.  In Media Composer 7 what I'd do is AMA to the clip and force it to maintain its aspect ratio in FrameFlex and then Transcode at closest to native frame rate.  IIRC, what's happening with your media is the Import controls you're using only apply to image files. What cell phones do is record the camera's orientation and write that data to a little tag in the header, which indicates which way is up. In this case, Avid isn't reading that tag, and is interpreting the footage in its native recording format.  The biggest disadvantage to my method here is that if the editors want to put anything behind the video, they have to mask out the black bars, but that's a pretty simple affair."
editors,3e4fij,Kichigai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:45:49 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! I really appreciate the step by step explanation. The frame rate seems to consistently be at 30fps.   One quick questions...what do you mean by fast import?
editors,3e4fij,_AndJohn,2,Tue Jul 21 22:59:06 2015 UTC,"There are two ways to get footage into Avid. First is the classic Import method. File (or right click), Import, and choose your source file and import format. Then it transcode the footage to whatever you're telling it to do.  The other is via AMA Link, and then you use the Transcode function, or you use Consolidate which will simply copy over the raw audio and video streams without transcoding anything, if it's a natively supported format (DNxHD, HDCAM, etc).  A Fast Import is what Avid does if you import a natively supported format, basically like a Consolidate.  And don't trust that your cell phone footage is actually 30.00 FPS. See if you can get permission to use MediaInfo if you're going to use a lot of cell phone footage in a lot of projects. It'll give you all sorts of nitty-gritty details that are useful in troubleshooting stuff."

For me it came down to two things.  1 - QuickTime can be better  2 - Vimeo can be better.   When exporting anything QuickTime, it's important to note a gamma shift is to be expected, sounds like you know this already. One thing I learned was that QuickTime is interesting because there are multiple programs that interrupt it in multiple ways. Try playing your video with different players (I used vlc vs wmp vs QuickTime player) same file and it looked WAY different across the board (but all of them looked washed out).  For what it's worth, this is why avi is kinda cool - it only has one code that can play it. So all video players will avi files the same.   Also - Vimeo has recently been using the blacks on all their uploads, don't know what's up - but it's a Vimeo problem. I know this will sound lame - but use youtube.   Enough of the problem - how to fix it.   Mine was by getting squeeze. It's pricey - but if you do this for a living id recommend looking into it. They have a filter that is designed for the EXACT thing you're talking about. And again - sounds lame and won't get you a lot of street cred - but upload to YouTube until Vimeo solves this problem."

editors,3e10ac,CleanCutCat,5,Tue Jul 21 03:10:05 2015 UTC,"The issue you are having here is because the relink function requires some solid metadata in order to work and it doesn't sound as though you've put it in.  Make a new set of Avid bin settings called AMA - have these columns selected: colour, name, tape, tapeid, disklabel, fps, drive, source.   Tape, tapeid and disklabel are all columns that you can add metadata to, so AMA to your clip and, generally speaking I do things this way:  Tape: I input the name of the roll (the folder which houses the media)  Tapeid: I use this as a backup for ""tape""  Disklabel: I put a small path to the file, eg: :/C>project_media>day14  The ""tape"" column can only be altered by selecting all the files, right clicking and choosing the ""set source"" option for the menu that drops down. In there you'll find a little drop down bar that will give you the option to say ""set tape"", enter the details and hot okay a bunch of times and now there will be metadata on the file that Avid can understand.   Transcode to whatever you want, the metadata will be on the .new.01 file too. When you're ready to relink, presuming you don't want handles, it should just be a vase of removing the drive that holds your proxy footage and inserting the drive which holds your hi res, then clicking on relink. If you look at the relink window in the middle on the left there ought to be a series of things detailing how Avid should relink. As standard I think this defaults to relink on the details of the Tape column, combined with the Name column and the timecodes of the file. So it'll see the same roll number in Tape, the same file name and find the same timecodes and go ""cool.""  also at the bottom there is something that says ""relink to this kind of media"" - make sure that's saying to relink to the highest quality of media available.  Using this method you can relink a proxy cut back to your initial AMA bins and then just transcode your sequence to whatever high res format you want by doing that..it minimizes the amount of high res material you're having to hold on to at all times.  Anyway..not sure if this made much sense but if you want some documents that I've written up in a more careful fashion then let me know - I can send them over.

editors,3e10ac,d1squiet,4,Tue Jul 21 16:03:18 2015 UTC,"The clip you're calling ""original media"" is an untouched (other than copied perhaps) piece of camera original, correct?  This will probably work:  Edit the offline clip into a sequence.  AMA in the original media.  So now you should have a bin with an online AMA clip called 11111AA.  Select the AMA clip and then right click on the sequence and choose ""relink"".   In the relink dialog click the checkbox ""relink to selected items in ALL bins"".   Now you should have a relinked seq with that clip online.   This may not solve the problem if you've used the clip in mutliple places and you deleted the media, but you will have the clip online at full resolution and you can cut it back in where needed.  In the future don't delete media just to bump up your clips.     It is possible the clip was imported and not AMA'ed, but seems unlikely since it was transcoded.  In that case though, you can select the clip and go to ""batch import"" and point it to the file that it originally came from.     I don't understand why Avid doesn't have a way to just point a clip to relink to a specific file.  Like ""relink to this file"" – if the file is the right duration/fps/etc it should relink."

Why not just flop the project over to 1080i59.94 (unless you mean 1080i 60.00)?   Also, I've tried highlighting the clip and then batch importing to the original file, but I get a popup that says ""You cannot import this file into a bin…""   Unfortunately certain formats can only be ingested through AMA Link/Transcode. So we're stuck using that method.   I could just AMA link/transcode to get the footage into the proper format, but then how do I get the clips in my timeline to properly link back to the new media?   Have you tried doing an AMA Link to your source footage, and then when you relink your sequence, try using these options:   Relink only to media from the current project: unchecked Relink by: Origina: Tape Name or Source File Name (not Source File ID), Ignore Extension Relink by: Target: Tape Name or Source File Name, Ignore Extension Relink by: Match case when comparing source names: unchecked Video Parameters: Relink to: Any HD video format   When you do this make sure you have the bin of AMA'd media open. It seems Avid has an out-of-sight-out-of-mind kind of attitude about AMA media. You will still have to do some QC to make sure nothing got screwed up, though. I once did this and had a bunch of audio files that were named the same get jumbled, so definitely do this in a copy of the sequence."

I've tried Cameo by Vimeo, which lets you add music, but it's their music. still good music though. it gives you a few different texts to choose from for titles, so that's kinda nice, and they have filters, not color correction. Not transitions though.   iMovie does have transitions, also, iMovie lets you add music under your video, and lets you adjust the volume of your music or your audio from your video independently. You can also makes cuts (or slices) on your videos, and add transitions (cross fade or straight cuts) wherever you want. But it does not have any color correction.  Honestly, you might be able to do some simple edits using the two different apps together. Make your cuts and transitions and music and audio adjustments in iMovie, save it to your camera roll, then bring it into Cameo to place some text and add a filter, and then save that to your camera roll  If you want more advanced editing, you might need to go to a computer. Honestly, this is mind blowing that you can do these simple edits on a cell phone. Color correction might be something in the near future, but as far as i've seen, there's nothing out there for your iPhone"

editors,3dyujs,justcarlos01,5,Mon Jul 20 17:23:19 2015 UTC,"Hello JustCarlos, this is Royce who sits behind you at work, I think we've met.  My followup question to this one would be, does anyone know if there's a way in Prelude to select multiple clips in the Project Panel and add all markers in those clips - to a rough cut.  From what we can tell, it seems like you have to do this clip by clip, since selecting multiple clips leaves the Marker List Panel blank.  We thought we had it for a moment, because you can select multiple clips inside a rough cut, and it'll populate all the included markers in the Marker List Panel, but then when you select those markers, the ""Add Selected Markers"" option (under the Rough Cut Menu) is grayed out.  :(  So basically, you have to go clip by clip, select all markers for that clip in the Marker List Panel, and go Rough Cut Menu > ""Add Selected Markers"" (shift+equals""="") for EVERY single clip.  And if you accidentally forget to add markers from one clip, there's no way to know you've missed one in your rough cut.  --Some people will wonder why we want to use comment markers instead of subclips, and it's because Prelude now has this awesome companion mobile app called ""Live Logger"" for on-the-fly clip tagging, where you can make templates of squares that are pre-named (comment marker names).  You can then pull that template up on your phone or tablet while shooting, and make named markers with a single tap to later auto-link to all your footage.  Plus we like it because the Marker List Panel in Prelude (same thing as the Markers Panel in Premiere) gives you a thumbnail, in/out times, and names of markers, and makes searching though clips for specific shots much easier (especially after the project is done).  Creating markers with tags is such a great feature!... but it's only like 90% of the way there, and lacking a few crucial capabilities.  Adding all markers within multiple clips to a rough cut (or just sending straight to Premiere) is one of them.  TL;DR:  In Adobe Prelude, how can you add all markers (tagged from live logging) inside multiple clips to a rough cut (or just straight to Premiere)?... without adding markers clip by clip?"

But, plenty of people have lost out on jobs from not knowing Avid.  And a few have lost out in jobs from now knowing premier.  In features, it's completely up to the editor. I know one guy who refuses to cut any feature on Avid. He will use FCX or Premier any day of the week. But most work on Avid because the shared environment is still better.   I, personally, haven't seen or heard of a single scripted TV show cut in premiere I have seen a few in FCP7 (about 5 years ago) but none in premiere.   Reality is a crap shoot. Most places in LA are avid shops. But some of the production companies that also do onsite Graphics are switching to premiere. And the old FCp7 shops are about 40/35/15 Avid/Premiere/FCX.   I would say this. Learn avid. If you really want to edit on TV or in Features avid is the way to go.  But keep working in premiere as well because you will have another skill that will absolutely help you find work when you run into one of those shops that work in premiere.

The big issue with converting won't just be frame rate conversion (which, unless you have a Teranex or something, will be a little shaky) but ensuring all your edits are still right.  This will mean a few long nights, as this will be a mostly hand-operated task. To aid in this I'd export (or mix down) your sequence at 29.97, reimport it in your 23.976 sequence, put it on top, drop the opacity, invert the color, change the blending mode and start to look for anomalies.

If it's good enough it might be worth it to just run the whole show through there, and then overcut all the 24p material (I'd be worried about pull-down and pull-down removal looking really janky).

editors,3du9c4,Brendan_Fraser,2,Sun Jul 19 19:31:37 2015 UTC,I'm going to start using this term...
editors,3du9c4,EventTrigger,16,Mon Jul 20 02:03:48 2015 UTC,"Does this compress the previously compressed video again? Is this hurting my picture quality in any way? Also, If I export it as DNxHD from After effects and reimport the result to premiere pro, will I see any difference?   Yes. Yes. Yes.   What's the difference between H.264 and DNxHD outputs?   h.264, is a standard, part of the MPEG4 (Motion Picture Group, revision 4) codec. MPEG4 has some 60 different parts, part 10 is this specific codec. There are two video codecs inside the specification.  By ""standard"" - I mean that anyone who follows the guidelines can build an encoder or a decoder that is compatible. They can't/won't change the format.   h264 was designed to allow some aggressive compression - more than it's predecessor MPEG2. h264 requires a higher amount of processor work. h265 will be even more aggressive, and yes, will require even more processor intensity.  h264 has become the defacto consumer camera compression because of the excellent picture quality at lower bit rates.  But it was designed to be a distribution codec - not a mastering/mezzanine/post codec.  DNxHD - this codec is designed by Avid (although it's been ratified by the SMPTE consortium). There are (appox) 5 versions of this codec. The number associated with it (36, 90, 115, 145, 220) are the description of the bit rate, which varies based on the frame size and frame rate.  This codec was designed specifically to deliver near to uncompressed quality with minimal damage; additionally, due to the nature of it's design, can withstand multiple compression cycles.    Should I be using DNxHD as an intermediate format while editing (on a PC)?   Yes, or Cineform, another excellent codec.   Also, everytime I export as H.264, it somehow changes the color quality, and the picture looks a bit washed out. Is this normal? What am I doing wrong?   This very much depends on your viewer - VLC uses a different engine than Premiere - the best way to evaluate the damage, is to put it back into Premiere to check. Thanks for your time, guys!  TL;DR? Don't use h264 for anything other than the last step. Use DNxHD or Cineform for mastering or reimporting."
editors,3du9c4,greenysmac,5,Sun Jul 19 17:04:04 2015 UTC,"Adding to what greenysmac is saying, Apple ProRes is another good DI. I personally use DNxHD (& migrating to the new DHxHR. Avids update to DNxHD, which initially brought 4K DCI and now supports custom resolutions up to 8K. I will also note that the codec settings for DNxHR are more like ProRes), but that is because I am an Avid editor. If I were using Premiere I would probably use ProRes 422 (or 4444 if I had something with 10bit colour) for everything until finishing. And even then I would probably still finish to ProRes, and then make my Final h.264 encode.  I assume you were trying to use h.264 for everything because that's what your camera used, right? I would also transcode all your footage to whatever DI you pick, so you have video files composed entirely of intra-frames."

They create a good groundwork, but they don't encourage you to be very creative.  Some of my favorite tutorials are Geryscale Gorilla (Cinema 4D) tutorials. Nick leaves his mistakes in. Really helps you to realise it isn't about dialing in a specific value that Andrew Kramer used, it's about playing around to find the look you want."

Knowing additional languages is just treated as an additional qualification. The bigger question is finding agencies that have good contacts with productions that are making Spanish speaking content. From what limited knowledge I have, they do most of there work out of Miami in the U.S. and Mexico city for a lot of the tele-novellas. If you have time to do the leg work, I would look up some content that you think you are qualified for and then look up the editor and see if they are repped by an agency. I did this years ago when i was looking for an agent for features. I just searched a bunch of editors and found their agencies and then approached a few of them."

editors,3dsik3,DaCristobal,6,Sun Jul 19 05:56:04 2015 UTC,"It's definitely doable, but how you do it depends on how complex the shot is (camera movement, depth of field, zoom, actors, blocking, changes in lighting, etc). You may benefit from a vfx supervisor on set to advise you on how to shoot the clean plate and how to get the best results for a matchmove to the clean plate.  I've done similar shots with motion control rigs where we had to remove sections of dolly track and composite together a bunch of shots to get a clean plate.  Do you have any specifics about the shot you're trying to get? or better yet, a storyboard? Feel free to PM me if you need help going through the specifics (and if you need help compositing the shot I can shoot you a link to my site) Good luck!  Edit to add:  The process can be pretty straightforward - you have your shot with the dolly track, and then you have a clean plate - the clean plate is ideally shot on set, but in a pinch can be generated in photoshop by painting out the track.  The footage is motion tracked and the tracking data applied to the clean plate. Then you can mask, warp, and feather the clean plate to blend it on top of the footage.  If there are lighting changes or elements which cross in front of the tracks, they will have to be rotoscoped/color corrected/etc."

editors,3dt3p7,tomcod,11,Sun Jul 19 04:51:49 2015 UTC,"Dunno if Premiere has them, but you'd use a proper waveform monitor (or a rasterizer or whatever, AKA Scopes). Ideally it would be a piece of hardware sitting on an HD-SDI output of your computer, but in a pinch software 'scopes aren't that bad.  You can try slapping a Legalization (AKA: Color Safe, as FCP7 called it) filter on top, and specifying your range that way, but in my experience they aren't 100% reliable (don't ask me why, I don't know; we've had enough instances of ""the magic green shit is too green"" to make it worth our time to buy a hardware limiter instead of manually color grading everything into compliance, even when it isn't our edited and graded footage).  I think SpeedGrade has scopes in it (I don't have enough experience with SpeedGrade to be certain) and I'm pretty sure After Effects does (I have yet to see something handed to us by our graphics guys that is outside delivery specs).  If it's that big a job, I might consider talking to a local firm about running your stuff through their legalizer to be positive. Ours is from an English firm called EyeHeight, and the unit is a little goofy (we've run into situations where it was incapable of legalizing some HDCAM footage), but Harris makes some fantastic gear.  A good shop should be able to backstop the legalizer with proper monitoring hardware that will tell you if you're out of spec. For example, we have a Tektronix WVR5000 waveform rasterizer that will throw an alarm whenever something is out of spec, and it also logs it (though its timecodes are often several frames off). That way if some kind of spurious signal causes a minor error you can go back and fix it by tweaking the hardware to ensure compliance.  0 to 700mV sounds like EBU r103-2000 range. Shouldn't be too hard to find someone who can handle that kind of compliance. Most gear made in the past decade should have it built in."

By the time you've been a lead for roughly 6/18 months you'll be the one answering questions here because you will have seen it all.   A camera man accidentally shot 1080i/30p on a 24p shoot? seen it!   (Interestingly enough this is a real camera resolution that fakes the p look in an interlaced environment. If you capture this stuff correctly in a 24p project the interlaced frames are the ones that will be dropped. You may have to play with the 2:3:3:2 pull down cadence and make it 2:3:2:3. But you can get rid of ALL interlaced frames in this bastardized resolution when you get the cadence right. pull down cadence in this situation is based on where/when the camera shoots it's blended frames)  One camera guy forgot to set his camera to ""Free run timecode"" and instead shot ""record run"" all day. Making all of his tapes for the day one long clip? Seen it!   (Sadly you have to make subclips every time he stops the camera. Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's not. Or, you can import his footage with ""detect spanned clips"" off. But that breaks footage up by 2gb limit and not start/stop)  The production wants to cut in 24p and deliver in 29.97/59.94i? Seen it (and pretty common these days)   An assist/editor accidentally deleted the .avp or folders in a project and Now the project isn't being seen on the Isis? Seen it!   (You can restore the .avp by pulling a copy out of one of the CPU folders within the project. Or you can make a new project and move all of the contents of the dead folder into the new project.)  Editor made a mix down and removed the mo down source from the timeline? seen it!

editors,3drayp,BaronOfBeanDip,3,Sat Jul 18 18:25:44 2015 UTC,"Impressive shooting. It's hard working on the move. No critiques there.  The edit is successful as it is. It's a trip I would want to go on. Saying it's good doesn't help you a lot though, so here are some critiques. It's long as it is. Particularly the rock climbing. Lots of the same shot, nothing particularly compelling about many of the shots. You could cut 50% of them and not lose a thing. You might remember they're high up at this point, they're close to the ground here, but unless I can see it I don't know.  The other thing is you seem to be focusing more on activities and less on people. That's an artistic decision that you have the option to make. Here's a video that focuses more on people while it shows activity. I think it's a bit more compelling because it's shorter and because you feel the experience more as you're seeing people experience, not seeing what they do. Their theme is live the language so there's a lot of text, but take the text away and look at what's underneath.  Finally I'd see about letting a couple wide shots hold a bit longer. Pacing is a tool. When you've been cutting fast a long shot makes an impact. When there's a lot to take in give the viewer a bit more time to take it in. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a brilliant example of wide shots that are compelling. In you video specifically a couple shots come to mind. The clip of the bikes at 1:10 could live a bit longer. The bikes race past, but if they take forever getting around the turn it gives more of a sense of space. 3:14 is another point. I would cut the 2nd wide and let the first live longer if you have the footage.  Hope you enjoyed the trip!"
editors,3drayp,soundman1024,2,Sat Jul 18 21:11:22 2015 UTC,"I think it was fantastic. Shot very well. I actually wanna know how many shitty shots you have because every shot in there looks great.   I have struggled with travel videos for a long time and I feel like what you have here is basically about as good as visually stimulating shots can get. But since you want some feedback, I'll share my opinion on travel videos.   You've for sure seen those beautifully edited travel videos on Vimeo that show you happy people smiling, reversed action, and tons and tons of slowmo. They're super pretty. That said, I'm tired of them. I'm realizing lately that I want something between what you have right now and a vlog full of personalities. You focus on the people a bit, but I don't get any sense of who they are. There is no story, no protagonist, only a collection of very beautiful shots.   That's how I see it. That's what you were going for and you pulled it off well. But I think that without overly edited post production, like that recent Sri Lanka video, you won't really stand out for travel videos. If you want to stand out, show a story, have a purpose and then mix in those beautiful shots you have.   EDIT: Watched the Iceland one, that's better in my opinion. More personalities, more fun, more enjoyable to watch because I can feel like I'm kind of there with you."

editors,3dpt2h,EventTrigger,3,Sat Jul 18 15:22:34 2015 UTC,I used to deal with this all the time until I figured it out. Do you understand why exactly it happens?
editors,3dpt2h,EventTrigger,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:25:27 2015 UTC,"i think i do for the most part. how it was explained to me was that each edit bay (where i work we have 5 edit bays connected over full duplex fiber) and each work station basically keeps a list of what exactly is where on the avid unity drives. avid scans the entirety of whats on the unity drives, and makes a list. As time goes on, the list and what is actually on the drive become more and more out of sync becuase you + 10 other people are working on the unity system, so avid goes WAIT A FUCKIN SECOND, I GOTTA SCAN. and makes a new list of what is where. and the cycle continues.   this particular day, i learned later on, we were deleting loads of old archives that were long gone off air and were no longer needed. so a huge chunk of stuff would be deleted, and then all of the stations would have to rescan."
editors,3dpt2h,EventTrigger,7,Sat Jul 18 07:38:51 2015 UTC,"Sort of. The list your talking about is really made up of two database files. In a single user environment you'd be loading media to a local drive, so your media path would be ""Avid MediaFiles\MXF\1\"". This is also where your database files sit. As you create media, files are added to that folder and logged into the database files. You know this.  In a multi-seat environment, that last folder, ""1"", is replaced by the computer's name. So the folder path on your Unity workspace changes to ""Avid MediaFiles\MXF\AVID4\"".   In this setup, each computer is responsible for building and maintaining the database files in its folder path. So if I create media on the station AVID2, and delete it from the same station, the Avid has no trouble maintaining its own database files in the path ""Avid MediaFiles\MXF\AVID2\"".   So the scanning issue comes into play when one computer deletes media created and logged by another computer. You create a title on AVID2, it's viewable to every station accessing that workspace. So I'm on AVID4 and see that title as junk. I delete it.   Suddenly, whoever is using AVID2 gets ""SCANNING X:\Avid MediaFiles\MXF\AVID2\"" pasted on their screen.   Because AVID4 can't access the database files built by AVID2, it can't update them. AVID2 detects that a change has been made and is programmed to treat the database files as bad, so it starts to rebuild them. Meanwhile, the guy on AVID4 doesn't have a clue that he just shut out another editor.   To resolve this, I've told my editors, ""DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING, UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH OR WORSE."" If I need to clean up a project, I generally wait till the end of the day, after I've confirmed all of our backups and deliverables were met. I can then delete the media through the Media Tool, tell the AEs to open the workspace on the other Avids at the end of their shift and let the drives scan overnight."
editors,3dpt2h,Kichigai,2,Sat Jul 18 12:17:46 2015 UTC,"In a multi-seat environment, that last folder, ""1"", is replaced by the computer's name. So the folder path on your Unity workspace changes to ""Avid MediaFiles\MXF\AVID4\"".   Your answer is 100% technically correct as I understand it, the only thing I'd note is that the 1 folder becomes AVID4.1, not AVID4. At least, that's how it works for us.   ""DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING, UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH OR WORSE.""   This is the right answer. I just wish I could convince our editors not to ingest media on their own, or at least ask what they should be doing. I worked on one project where media was ingested three different ways: AMA Linked, Imported, and AMA'd then put on a timeline and had bits and pieces consolidated. When graphics came to me looking to get the raw files (since they were going to be stylizing their presentation) I had a hell of a time figuring out where to even begin to find things.  The way we handle multiple projects, though, is that our system (TerraBlock, emulating Unity) is we create separate volumes for each project, so I can nuke the crap out of one project without effecting people working on another.  The thing I don't get is why is the drive scan taking so long here? I've had 9TB of data scrubbed in less than two minutes over 4GbPS Fibre Channel."
editors,3dpt2h,EventTrigger,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"the only thing I'd note is that the 1 folder becomes AVID4.1   Yep, forgot about that.   You got me thinking now.... One of our projects was a mass of 7TB of assorted footage, 80% of it original card media and 20% managed Avid Media in a ""1"" folder. At the time I just copied this folder into the MXF folder on our ISIS workspace. It came with its own db files, but we always had trouble searching that media inside Avid.  I know you can take a ""1"" folder, change it to ""2"" (out whatever the next available number is) and drop it into the MXF folder on a local drive (that has an existing ""1"" folder already), and it'll pick right up without a hitch.   Say I have the following folders in my ISIS workspace:   AVID1.1 AVID2.1 AVID3.1 AVID3.2 AVID4.1   If I take this additional ""1"" folder, rename it to ""AVID2.2"", and add it to the others, would Avid 2 be able to search and/or manipulate the database (deletion/addition of media)?  And regarding the ingest of media, I feel ya. Seeing someone try to consolidate GoPro footage while transcoding a DNxHD QuickTime... It kills your soul. I've had 4 meetings with our editors in the past 2 years over the correct way to bring in media, not to mention the countless one-on-ones, and no one ever takes notes. I've got a white paper in Evernote that I've been building for the past year outlining all these procedures; one day I'll finish it....  ... and retire the month after that."

Then you just change the assistant computers name to scanname every Friday night and let it scan over the weekend.   You have to change the folder names in the finder when the editors aren't there.

I would expect  Photoshop to default to the card used by the display, but Photoshop uses the GPU rarely so less muscular Quadro is fine.  To those less tech savvy: nVidia's GTX cards don't support 10-bit color, and DVI-D doesn't support it either, period. Quadro over Display Port or HDMI (depending on revision) allows for it."
editors,3dnwum,soundman1024,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:25:29 2015 UTC,"The GTX will render 10 bit video. With Premiere it's a GPU Compute process, not a video pipeline process. The GTX will not display 10 bit video. For nvidia 10 bit display is limited to the Quadro line. As /u/huh009 suggested you could use a GTX to render 10 bit video and display it on a broadcast monitor.  To see 10 bit video you need one of the following pipelines:   A Quadro or FirePro using Windows feeding a 10 bit computer monitor. Note that OS X does not support 10 bit color for workspace displays. Note that you will be in an RGB based color space. If you are doing broadcast work you'll want to use a broadcast display in a YUV color space. A Decklink, Kona, or similar and a 10 bit broadcast display (such as a Flanders Scientific) connected over SDI. The most recent HDMI implementations support deep color, but stick with SDI to avoid complications. HD-SDI supports 720p, 1080i, and 1080p at up to 30fps. 3G-SDI supports everything HD-SDI supports plus it supports 1080p at up to 60fps. Note that while helpful a GPU is not required for 10 bit display when using a broadcast i/o. Any GPU that is compatible with the Mercury Playback Engine may be used to improve performance while maintaining 10 bit fidelity. Note that you will be in the YUV color space. If you're doing web work you'll want to use your 8 bit RGB computer monitors for color reference.   When working in Premiere you'll need to be sure your sequence codec supports 10 bit color. I suggest Avid DNxHD nnnX where n is a number and x denotes 10 bit color. The specific number changes based on the frame size and rate. Most color applications (SpeedGrade, Resolve, etc.) will render in greater than 10 bit color and will display 10 bit by default, no sequence settings to complicate the process.  Hope this helps."

Also, I'm no networking expert, but if memory serves you're basically running two GigE links in parallel in an LACP configuration like that, which means that each stream is still constrained by the limitations of a single link. So in this situation you're using LACP so no one workstation is consuming all the bandwidth going to or from the ISIS, but rather they can be load balanced between the two.  In that situation, though, assuming you're running LACP on both sides, unless you're doing DPX/TGA image sequences, uncompressed, or 4K+ RAW/RED video it's unlikely you'd saturate the connection. That's all back of the envelope math in my head, though."
editors,3dn0ea,Kichigai,2,Sat Jul 18 00:42:32 2015 UTC,"ISIS doesn't use traditional bonding across multiple links. The client manager application splits UDP packets over the available links, so bandwidth scales almost linearly when you start adding additional links. avid only documents and qualifies up to 2x links per client, but I have tested 4x1Gb links and the throughput does scale fairly well, provided you have enough disks to saturate that kind of pipe.  you can test this by using the avid 'pathdiag' application, which installs with the client manager: on a dual link client, unplug 1 link and run pathdiag. document results. reconnect 2nd link and re-run pathdiag. you should see 60-90% improvement on the single test file that pathdiag uses.       in almost any other networking application, you are correct that link teaming/bonding doesn't scale linearly, and requires multipathing on the client and server sides (introduced with windows 8.1/SMB3.0), or multiple concurrent connections between client and server. IE: a single file copy operation will NOT split across multiple connections.    the exception to this is infiniband, which can theoretically scale a single data conenction over multiple physical links."

See, the way it works is that there are (at least) two USB controllers on your computer: one for the USB 2.0 ports and one for the USB 3.0 ports. The USB 3.0 port is connected to the additional pins required for USB 3.0 speeds, and is capable of working at 2.0 speeds for 2.0 devices. Since there is such a distinct hardware difference there is absolutely no way for a 2.0 device to operate as a 3.0 device. It has to be 3.0 (or 3.1) on both sides (the computer and the device) for you to get those speeds.   I suppose I could plug it into my Mac.   If you Mac doesn't have 3.0 ports then it won't be helpful in this situation.   I know the card reader works in general, because it works in the USB 2.0 port.   Part of it works in a USB 2.0 port. USB 2.0 uses four pins, USB 3.0 however uses nine (the additional five are hidden in the plug). So if any of those additional pins are damaged anywhere from the connector all the way back to the USB Controller in the reader then that could cause it not to work in a USB 3.0 port. It could also be a malfunction in the device's controller itself, preventing it from being able to speak proper USB 3.0.   I'm a Mac person, I was just given this PC for the film and told to make it work.   You might want to try the troubleshooting tips here.

editors,3djzeo,starfirex,7,Thu Jul 16 21:54:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, it matters. Networks will reject them if they find discrepancies. I've even had networks processing a backlog of deliverables and reaching out to address issues a year after delivery.  Being precise allows proper accounting and calculations for rights holders, and it also serves as future-proofing in case a show needs to be rebuilt from scratch. It'd suck, but with proper CCSLs, EDLs, cue sheets, and so on, someone could theoretically take all of the individual assets and put the entire show back together."
editors,3djzeo,drfartbrain,4,Fri Jul 17 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"This happens. I worked with a lady who did the ""did directors cut"" for a pretty big feature. The directirs cut came out 10/15 years after the feature so it was done in Avid where the feature was done on Lightworks (or film....can't remember completely)   She had to rebuild the show from scratch using the edls and cue sheets. It took a long time. But ended up being pretty good.   And it will happen again in the future because at some point people will be editing with a system that barely exists (or doesn't exist) today. And 12K ZeeRay disks will have taken place of bluray and 4 k so some schlub will have to do something similar with a show that is currently brand new."
editors,3djzeo,elriggo44,4,Fri Jul 17 01:15:44 2015 UTC,It's a huge deal actually. The cue sheets are how the music artists are paid royalties. You could totally hose someone out of a bunch of cash if you do the cue sheets incorrectly.   You could also get the network sued if you somehow screw up the track info. I was on a show that went into syndication with a bad cue sheet and there was a track that was licensed for x number of years. But someone screwed up and licensed the wrong track. The network had to pay a bunch of money to fix the issue.
editors,3djzeo,elriggo44,2,Fri Jul 17 01:12:48 2015 UTC,"It's not just music artists, it's actors too! We've done a lot of those recap specials and the individual actors that are distinguishable in each shot get a certain royalty if the show is ≥51% show content or a different one if the show is ≥51% interviews. So the EDLs are used to verify that a show qualifies for certain royalty schedules.  The EDLs also point to which parts of which shows were used, and then the distinguishable actors in each shot (yes, each shot, not scene) are paid by how much screen time they're given. It also indicates what audio was used, so if a dialogue track wasn't employed it can be used to indicate that even though in this scene an omitted actor was speaking but not seen (e.g. another actor reacting to the dialogue), for the purposes of this show their voice wasn't heard, and therefore they cannot claim royalties against that."
editors,3djzeo,Kichigai,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:50:23 2015 UTC,And in scripted Directirs get paid every time you use something they shot.   I worked on a show where we needed a Greenscreen of an animal. We had one from season 1s pilot. We used it and the director got paid his percentage for that single comped shot.   So they are important for pretty much anything having to do with accounting.   I was mainly referring to Cue Sheets because that seemed to be the crux of ops question.

And anything licensed in the shot (e.g. a piece of art) or any product placement.   I was mainly referring to Cue Sheets because that seemed to be the crux of ops question.   I figured, I just thought I'd expand on what you had said to underline the importance of getting the paperwork right."

editors,3djzeo,elriggo44,2,Fri Jul 17 17:23:04 2015 UTC,"When I was working a lot in TV, it was basically used for A) paying the royalties for any music and B) so the network knew when to put their lower third promos on screen without covering up any GFX in the show."
editors,3djzeo,TheKyMan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:52:21 2015 UTC,Networks are are so finicky about that stuff.  We have 3 person  team that only does paperwork all day long for deliverables.  And I'm not sure but I think financial penalties against the total payment can be applied for missed delivery milestones.

We've done music videos and a short film. I'm usually grip and music composer for most things in our productions, but this was my first time doing multiple major roles; Co-Writing, Acting, Directing, Editing, Sound, and Music. I'm a bit worried I spread myself thin and would like some feedback to help polish it. If not, just a view would put a smile on my face.  But I’ve been getting mixed feedback, HERE Some say its fine. I’ve taken a few days off of watching it and am ready to polish it a bit, but wanted some feedback."
editors,3dhy2r,Tripp-Lite,3,Thu Jul 16 12:38:47 2015 UTC,"Fun low-budget concept. Great job! You had me smiling. Here are a few things I noticed.  Throughout the whole piece the mix kept taking me out of it. Yes, gum chewing is the joke but it'll still play if it's not unrealistically loud. Sounds like you wore a lot of hats making this, I'd suggest you step away and let another ear help (and eye too), preferably a friend with audio experience or obviously ideally a pro audio person help out. I'll be the first to admit I'm not a pro audio mixer so on passion projects I beg favors from my friends who are.  Could use some color correction, just make sure to avoid the whole Instagram filter look that seems popular with indie shorts these days.  You might get some complaints about the beginning being long, that doesn't bother me as much as the change in pacing when cop #2 arrives. It's a little abrupt of a change, but to be fair I think the comedy timing was more on point from that point on forward. I think what would help you for pacing in that first part would be either having a less repetitive track or just use it less. It got tiresome pretty quickly and if you don't have a great selection of tracks to use don't be afraid to go without (as long as you fix that mix)  Overall though, great work for $100! Keep it up, make some more."

editors,3djsny,Namisaur,2,Fri Jul 17 17:26:22 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry.  It looks like a big project.  I don't have CC to mess with the file.  Not that it helps you now, but you need to increase the number of autosaves so they'll span the time frame of the edit.  Most of the systems I work with are set to 500 different copies, where the default is 5.  The Autosave interval is set to 5 min rather than 20.  If you have a wide range of auto saves to choose from, yet none of them open, I'd think that something in very wrong with your Premiere install(activation issues?) or the hard drive that the .prproj files resides on.  Another tip:  Set your dockable SATA with an unusual Drive letter like W, X, Y, or Z so it won't conflict with your typical external storage devices which will be chosen randomly from the top of the alphabet."

editors,3djsny,fanamana,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:38:32 2015 UTC,"None of your autosaves work? Have you made sure to try the oldest ones?  Do you perhaps have the option to backup your project to creative cloud turned on?  Anyway, this all could have been resulted in proper project backup.  Don't just rely on autosave and one primary save file.  Every few hours, or at least twice a day you should be using the command ""Save as"" and name it by date and version.  At the end of the day, you definitely should do this command again regardless of how many you've already done that day.  When you start editing again the next day, duplicate the last project file you save, rename it accordingly, and then open that one.  For organization's sake, you can put all the old versions in a separate folder and only have your current version out in the open.  This method ensures that at most, you only lose 1 day of work and you will never worry about starting over again.  So it would look something like this in addition to your autosaves.  There's no way I could screw up enough to lose the entire project like this. I suggest adopting a similar system for your new edit."

Level it out by pulling the shadows down a bit - not enough to lose details in the blacks. You may want to experiment with the mids by bringing them up slightly. Add some saturation to make his skin tones look a little more natural - it might help those flowers pop a bit in the background.   Hope this helps."

Id explain that at the beginning you thought the project would be different than it is, and that you're just not feeling the draw you need to continue a project of this nature. Then you could say because of that, you feel you have to move on to another project. Maybe it isn't compelling to you, and maybe it won't be compelling to any audience member, but that doesn't mean you should try to stop it from getting made by telling them that. Sometimes passion projects aren't about pleasing an audience.

Maybe  I was an asshole, I don't know, but I had seen it before and I knew it was a dead end...  So it all depends on your relationship with them. If they are someone you consider a friend, obviously it will be a lot tougher. Still, the way to go no matter who they are to you is something along the lines of ""I need to focus on paying my rent right now, and this isn't doing that at the moment""  The universal thing we are all trying to do in this industry is make money and if someone isn't paying you, you have zero obligation to help them and even if they are ignoring that, they know it."

editors,3de0wt,muffintoxico,3,Wed Jul 15 19:56:30 2015 UTC,"Tell them you can no longer work for low/none. Leverage by taking on more jobs or just saying that business ""has picked up"" and that you can no longer afford to compromise paid work for free work.  Don't worry about ""jumping ship"" if it's low/no, the reality is you as a business must put your longevity first before favours. You've offered more than enough having set up the project and likely having worked towards establishing creative to help resuscitate the project.   This way, it is now up to them whether their passion project is worth continuing.   As with a lot of passion projects, I'm willing to bet the director/ writer/etc, is continually making revisions, breathing over your shoulder, booking up your time. It is very worth while for them, but respecting an editors time becomes passive as they push the ""were in this together!""  idea. Sure it can be a great experience if that's the case, but most times it's not. If he/ she starts paying, even for smaller sessions or 1 day of your time a week, they'll surely get their shit together before each meeting and deliver proper notes, fearful of burning their cash instead of yours via time.   If you're worried about an ugly credit, don't be. Its one of many, many jobs in your future as an editor and will not tarnish your name.  Just worry about getting paid.   Just be firm on your rate. If you really hate this whole experience, raise your rate To a point where it's worth it. If they question, just explain its what you've been agreed to on other jobs as an editor. If they decide otherwise, you can consolidate the project on their hard drive and pump out an xml as well in case.  ""Thanks, glad we had the opportunity to work together, good luck"""
editors,3de0wt,Tenjuan,3,Wed Jul 15 22:23:22 2015 UTC,"I've had this same experience time and again, I just no longer work on someone else's passion project. Even when I politely decline and stress that my job is editing and editing pays my bills I still get blow back from time to time. I came to a harsh but true revelation after a project went way sideways and the director lost her shit on me: no one is under any obligation to be as passionate about your project as you; if your project is worthy other people will gravitate towards it. It's a hard thing for someone to realize that their emotional investment isn't paying dividends and often they personalize things too much. I know if someone asks me to work with them they are doing that because I have a proven skill set and track record, that they are asking me because they respect me, but I've also had to learn to explain that my skill set doesn't come cheap and that I also have a career I'm passionate about and that sometimes these two passions are mutually exclusive. It's hard letting someone down easy, often the project will wither and die if not done immediately. What I try to do is frame things in terms of lessons learned and skills gained: sure, you didn't complete your short, sure you weren't able to pull off the Sundance winning coup you envisioned, you lost the war, but you won a lot of battles. Each of those small victories is worthwhile, each one of them was worth the effort. If you look at the project as a process and a series of smaller projects you begin to see what positives you can take away and what negatives you can leave behind. Maybe this short will never see the light of day, maybe it's best that it doesn't, but that doesn't mean that it was a waste and it doesn't mean that the next project you take on will be worse for your efforts on this one.  Things get tricky when people get emotionally invested, as the pro in the room your job is to redirect that energy and push them forward rather than letting them languish in a failed project, no matter how much they may care about it. And if that fails then you have to just walk away and hope they find that enlightenment themselves; creative ventures aren't for everyone, if you can't fail, learn and move on then it's probably best you find a different way to spend your time and energy.  <edit for typo>"

editors,3ddvwx,Bane_and_Boon,2,Wed Jul 15 15:04:55 2015 UTC,"I'd choose based on speed.  Theoretical max speeds for connections:  Thunderbolt 2 - 20Gbps  Thunderbolt 1 - 10Gbps  USB-C - 10Gbps  eSATA - 6Gbps  USB 3/3.1 - 5Gbps  As far as recommendations, I love the Pegasus R6 (2 years with no issues with two 24TB RAID enclosures), but it's probably no good if you're editing on a PC (Thunderbolt only). It's also pretty expensive. I'm sure someone else here is more familiar with PC options.   *Edit: posted wrong/old speed for eSATA"

editors,3deqls,fletcherkildren,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:06:33 2015 UTC,"I'm trying it out right now. It reminds me a bit of Premiere in some ways, but simplified.  The big issue I've hit so far is that it doesn't support AC-3 audio without purchasing a license. This means no AVCHD in the free version. Worse yet is when I hit the button to go to the HitFilm Store to check out the license their website gave me a 404. After crawling around their site for a while (which I shouldn't have to do in order to buy something like this) I found out it's $9.99 for the ""Premium Formats"" package.  The weird thing is that it likes the rest of the footage my camera (Lumix G6) kicked out at 1080p59.94, and the 2160p30 footage my cell phone produced, but not AVCHD. Granted, $10 isn't bad, but it feels like a real cop-out to not put that kind of warning up front, especially when AVCHD is such a common format.  It also doesn't support JKL keyboard shortcuts, which has really thrown me for a loop since most other editing tools support that. The whole gamut of keyboard controls are clunky, actually. The arrow keys are always moving video around within the frame, never allowing for frame-by-frame searching. Nor does it have any facility for rendering things.  I'm not pleased with the lack of options with exporting formats (YouTube, H.264, Image Sequence, and AVI) but I am pleased that it at least gives me some choices within each one (uncompressed AVI is better than nothing!), which is more than most free programs give me, and is appreciated at this level.  I also like that it uses Drop-Frame timecode in 29.97 mode, and it seems to cope with variable frame rate media alright.  There is no keyframing functionality, though, which is a little annoying and basically means there is no facility for time warping (though there is a speed control effect, but when I tried to use it it crashed the program). Variable frame rate support is... not good. Not awful, but not good."
editors,3deqls,Kichigai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:40:09 2015 UTC,"Simon here from HitFilm.com. Thanks for the feedback, lots of really good observations here. I thought I'd response to a few of 'em:   Not sure what happened with the 404 on the premium formats pack. I've informed our web team so they'll be looking into that. It may have just been a temporary glitch as our servers are being hammered at the moment. Regarding the premium formats pack, the reason we have to charge for that one is that we have to pay licensing fees for those formats. So if we included them in the free version of Express it would actually cost us - and given how much people are downloading and using Express, you can imagine the bill would get pretty big. ;) You can change some of the shortcuts in the Options window. The arrows keys move layers around which makes more sense when you're working on a composite shot. Shortcuts, especially in the context of the editor, are something we're actually looking at in detail at the moment, so it's useful to know that it was one of the first things you noted. There is keyframing, but not in the editor. For animation generally you want to go into a composite shot timeline.  We have a couple of tutorials which detail the timeline setup. The tutorials were made for the Pro version, but the general concepts still apply to Express:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHSUGHvF_Fk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bawBXIhMxsM  Thanks again for the feedback.

Regarding the premium formats pack, the reason we have to charge for that one is that we have to pay licensing fees for those formats.   I figured it was a licensing issue. I just might put some kind of notification about that earlier in the process of getting set up, rather than waiting until I import some AVCHD footage. Something like a screen at the back end of the installer or right after software activation that says ""Visit the HitFilm website to buy additional features, like AVCHD support, etc. etc."" Or pull an Nvidia/AMD and put that right in a little ad that's up while the software installs. ""While you're waiting, check out the store for additional features, like AVCHD support, new effects, blah blah blah.""   The arrows keys move layers around which makes more sense when you're working on a composite shot.   Which would make sense in compositing mode, but I was in the editor. I'm coming from Premiere and Final Cut Pro which do the same thing, but only when I have my viewer selected. I feel like when I have my timeline selected I should be able to go back and forth in there if I have no specific clip selected.   There is keyframing, but not in the editor. For animation generally you want to go into a composite shot timeline.   I'm not even thinking advanced animation here, just simple scaling and changing opacity and whatnot. At this point in time there are smartphones on the market that are shooting both DCI and UHD 4K/2160p material, and being able to scale things up and down in the editor would be incredibly helpful."
editors,3deqls,Kichigai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"Good ideas in terms of putting the notice up front. There is then the counter-point of potentially confusing a different group of people for whom AVCHD isn't an issue. But yes, thanks for the feedback and we'll certainly think about ways to make it all a little clearer.  Regarding shortcuts, I essentially agree with you. :) Something I'd like to see in a future version is the ability to (optionally) set keyboard shortcuts separately for the editor and the compositor. That way everybody can have their cake and eat it.  I know it's very easy for devs to go ""thanks for the feedback, we'll definitely think about it!"", but a huge amount of what has formed HitFilm 2 and HitFilm 3 came directly out of suggestions from the community, and some of what you mention is actually already on the radar.

I only mention that because that appears to be the gimmick they are pushing to convince people that their software will make you a filmmaker.  If you look at the promotional videos with an objective eye, you will notice something very peculiar. While they are visually appealing, they lack something.. and in my opinion they lack what should be the most important thing of all: a good story.

editors,3dedct,OurJesuitPaymasters,7,Wed Jul 15 16:47:12 2015 UTC,"Here is what I suggest: Ask your counselor the enrollment numbers for both classes. If they aren't close to filling up as the school year starts in August then go to the first day of each class and look at their syllabus and stay after to see if you can squeeze in a question or two with the professors. If the CA community college system hasn't changed much since I went, you can enroll in any class that isn't full within the first week or so.  With such low-level classes, I would expect the tools to be nearly the same but the content you'll be editing is different. In broadcast you may be trimming down a news story into a short piece and adding lower thirds while a film editing class may be editing a scene and adding music. In broadcast you may be exposed to things like playback systems or tape decks.  I've found that most broadcast classes are tailored to local broadcast: news, sports, local commercials, etc. and have nothing to do with narrative television or narrative, high end commercials. Knowing that, I would probably bet on the cinema classes."

editors,3dedct,Bobzyouruncle,3,Wed Jul 15 22:13:54 2015 UTC,"I went to Ithaca College. We had a film major and a TV-radio major. I majored in the latter with a focus on video production. The difference for us was that film kids took more film theory and analysis and focused on features. TV kids did not shoot on film stock cameras and focused on all sorts of TV projects- news, sports, and scripted, too.   That doesn't mean your school is the same, but for me I went with TV because it didn't feel like it prevented me from learning the same story-telling skills as film kids.   Looking at those courses, everything you list looks important, with some crossover in the editing classes. I would recommend that you learn AVID later in your schooling, too, even on your own time.

I went with the same CPU, GPU and RAM, and I don't think it's overkill.  The advice I got on the GPU is that Adobe is quite forgiving of graphics cards, and that I could probably get away with a GTX 960. I'm not sure how true this is of Avid. I went with the 970 to be safe.  In terms of cooling, I can only speak from experience of this one build, but I wouldn't worry too much about it. I've gone with a Micro ATX case and was concerned that cooling would be a problem. I've got the same Noctua CPU cooler as you, 3x120mm fans and a 230mm. My CPU idles well below 30 degrees, and doesn't get much above 30 under load (ambient temps in the UK probably help). I guess if you're not overclocking then cooling kinda takes care of itself. I'd say just get whatever case you prefer the look of and don't fret too much about cooling.   EDIT: Just noticed your concern with the case was noise, not heat.

Here is what they want:  A prores of the texted version of the show with A1-A2 as the stereo mix. A3-A8 containing the 5.1 Mix A9/A10 are stereo music and effects only.   Then a textless with a1-a2 stereo mix A3-A8 5.1 mix and a9-a10 Stereo dialogue, music and effects mixed.   They also want bounces of the 5.1, stereo mix, Stereo M&E mix and stereo Dialogue, music and fx mix.   Unless I am misreading DME to me DME means Stereo mix. But that seems off because they ask for a stereo mix in the specs then DME later.   Do you have Vo in this show? If you do, stereo mix contains the VO and DME doesn't.

editors,3da5qf,Agontile,2,Tue Jul 14 21:24:11 2015 UTC,"Yes. I am positive. The bounce is the output of the audio. But it is also much more   They are called bounces by audio guys because It comes from the tape deck days.  Back in the day of smaller track counts, when we only had 4 tape tracks, one would record on 3 of the tracks and then ""bounce"" the audio all down to the 4th track which would free up the first three.   Currently in the world of digital audio, the term ""bouncing"" gets used for a few things:  submixing many tracks to an aux track to process with one singular effect, or for creating stems for simplified mixing / turnover specs. It can also mean the mixing down audio tracks with lots of FX to free up processing power and lock in the effects.   I'm sure there are other meanings. But it originated back in the days of audio tape.   So a bounce can be the same as an output of stems.   if a protools guy outputs stems, he calls them the bounce. If a video guy outputs stems he calls them stems or splits.   If the pro tools guy mixes down the audio in his system for any reason he also calls it a bounce. It's basically used anytime you mix multiple layers to each other. In any format.

If not, check the Audio Hardware preferences in Premiere as well as whatever control panel/drivers that came with your playback card.     When you go to export sequences, do you have any locked tracks? I haven't tested it out in CC 2015 yet but on CC 2014 I have had clips slip on export, ironically because the tracks were locked.    As far as your editors not being able to move audio clips to certain tracks, this is likely because they are using specific types of tracks rather than Standard audio tracks which accept most if not all audio clips (not sure about 5.1 clips). http://imgur.com/gNGoaMA"

When you place the clip in a sequence, it will have a green dot, indicating FrameFlex has automatically been applied. I think it generally defaults to a ""Blended Interpolated"" method of rate conversion. You can check it by selecting the clip in the timeline, and then opening the motion effect editor. Oh, render the timeline at this point.  Now, click the Promote button, and it'll promote the FrameFlex effect to Timewarp. Now you can adjust speed in the motion effect editor. The left graph is your speed graph; click it and you'll likely see that the line is at 100. Drag it down to 80, and it'll redistribute all 30 frames per second across 24fps. This will slow the clip down slightly and extend the duration a bit.  For a batch option, agent42b's console command sounds like something you can apply globally to the clips. That'll be the way to go if you have a ton of these."

editors,3d4i0t,Kichigai,2,Mon Jul 13 22:42:22 2015 UTC,I have a hard time comprehending codecs and bitrates and other specs to consider when exporting for specific uses. Can you suggest any tutorials or videos to help me learn this better?
editors,3d4i0t,rageharles,3,Mon Jul 13 17:36:27 2015 UTC,"That's a big field there. What you basically are asking about is everything that has to do with compression, period. So let's start with a big picture look and go from there.  For the most part there are two major classes of codecs: Inter-frame codecs and Intra-frame codecs.  Intra-frame compression is pretty basic. Each frame is its own little unit and is compressed all on its own. This tends to have very low computational overhead because to look at a frame you just need to decode that one frame. It's also easy to edit since you can jump in and out any any point without requiring any additional context from the stream. The down side is that intra-frame formats tend to be rather large, as they aren't all that efficient.  Inter-frame compression on the other hand is far more efficient. It stores sequences of frames, called a Group of Pictures, or a GOP, and applies compression across the whole set. The way this typically works is that at the front you have an I-frame (sometimes called a Keyframe) which contains a full image of the frame. What follows that is a sequence of frames that only contain information what what has changed since that I-frame. This would include what are called motion vectors, which describe the motion of what's happening in the frame (like something moving from left to right) and additional macroblocks for new visual information (like an object entering the frame). This yields incredibly high compression ratios by eliminating the need to store redundant data, or any data that you might not perceive as missing (mostly). The down side is that it adds a lot of computational complexity, because now several frames are needed to be decoded in order to reconstruct one.  Now, as far as bitrates are concerned, that's just a budget of how much data can the encoding engine use to describe a given amount of time. So for example 20MbPS means it has twenty megabits (125 kilobytes) to use to describe a second of video. The encoding engine will then allocate where it needs to be, and make sacrifices to cope with the fact that you aren't allocating enough data to operate losslessly. When encoding video typically variable bitrates are used, and you are specifying a target bitrate. By employing VBR you're giving the encoding engine to use more or less (typically ±50%) than your target bitrate if it thinks that is appropriate. So it might not need to use 20MbPS to acceptably encode color bars, but it might need more than 20MbPS for a fast-motion action scene. Two pass encoding allows the engine to keep a log of what's happening in the video and the decisions it made, and on the second pass it makes improved decisions on how to allocate data and reference frames (if possible)."

To be fair, I think this particular suite has a rather non-standard configuration.  It's only MC8 that has started making the fullscreen button fill up both displays - which I guess in a 'normal' configuration would actually be pretty useful.  I've managed to suss a workaround though that doesn't involve any resolution switching :)  Fullscreenizer seems to do the trick, and sets the window to precisely the dimensions of my primary display without overlapping to the second; exactly like the maximise button used to back in MC7.  Use it at home for games, had no idea it could be useful for MC."

The best advice I can give someone who wants to work in film or TV is to just move to LA or NYC already. Just take the plunge. You may as well do it when you are young because it gets harder the more responsibilities you have (mortgage, kids, etc...).   It's not an easy road, but everyone works out here and didn't grow up here has a story about jumping in the car (or on the plane) and moving to lA. Usually involving but not limited too:  Crazy roommates, lots of ramen, car troubles and their first job.   Once you get that first gig, stay in touch with your piers and superiors. Everyone out here does it, and depending on where you grew up, it can feel weird. But, I get a few emails or texts a week of people who are just ""checking in"" and I do the same.

I have a decent amount of editing/software understanding but haven't gotten a hold of enough functional footage to make a convincing reel.

You're working with a variety of folks in a variety of projects, which is pretty much exactly what you should be doing right now.   Without seeing your work, i'd venture to say that you're potentially hirable by production companies as an AE or post PA of some type.   My best piece of advice to you is to use this time to take risks and explore different people/genres/projects with the goal of finding your focus. Your path will vary depending on whether you strive towards film, TV, or commercial work, etc.   Time spent now in school, horsing around(with projects) and finding your niche while you're young isn't wasted in my opinion. Experiment now, and plan not to anymore once you graduate.  Best of luck!"

You've got a lot more experience than most people do, but the critical thing about the path to becoming an Editor is realizing it has very little to do with learning software, or even the art of storytelling through editing. It's about learning the industry, building client relationships, and knowing how to run a room; balancing different interests while keeping your eye on the ultimate goal of a great final product.  Learning some more about what an AE actually does on higher end projects might also help you. It's not just the technical stuff.  Sounds like you're on your way.

I don't remember his SN but it was related to his name, and he was easy to identify from the credits. Go back through some similar types of posts. If I remember, I'll tell you. I remember him being a little bit into his own shit, but he would be able to give you very specific anecdotal advice. I think he was also interviewed for Avid about their workflow on the Avengers. That might be a way to find his post.  I've done a lot of commercials, but started in NYC so I can't really advise on how to break into the feature industry in LA without an established reel. I know a lot of people who have transitioned from commercials to TV / Film. It's not exactly easy, but my best advice would be to stay away from reality while you're young.   You'll be paid more / promoted faster in reality, and it will be easier to get gigs; but it will come at the cost of sacricifing your options later. Nobody hires reality Editors for scripted.  You're well ahead of the curve though. Don't sweat it. Only people ahead are likely Tisch / USC gunners, and really everyone there wants to be a Director and then ends up settling on Editing later than you have— but they'll have a better network.

Do they have any interest in using the GoPros at 50% speed? If not, you could lock in their frame rate to 25p at transcode."
editors,3d2e10,EventTrigger,2,Mon Jul 13 00:39:08 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the offline workflow will be transcoding to DNXHD36. I spoke to the Post supervisor and he is thinking about creating 25p submasters via compressor/program TBC and transcoding those into DNHD offline files.
editors,3d2e10,elriggo44,2,Mon Jul 13 04:08:24 2015 UTC,"I would bring the go pro in at 50 and then use the speed change button to create new master files for all of the go pro at 25. You just hit the speed change button (which you will have to map to one of your source window empties) and tell it to change the speed to 200%  You can then group the changed clips with the other masters and audio, and leave the 50 frame footage in the bin in case the editor wants to use it.   That way you can still link back to camera originals in an AMA proxy workflow."
editors,3d2e10,Kichigai,2,Mon Jul 13 02:47:14 2015 UTC,"Avid will handle the speed change automatically. I suggest telling it to use the ""VTR-Style"" interpretation.

editors,3d2e10,elriggo44,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:10:22 2015 UTC,"Right, but then you don't have the camera masters the way that they shot them.   I always assume that the director/producer will want the media as shot in the system, so this is my workflow. That way I have the ability to cut both the slow motion masters and the regular speed footage.   As long as you are working in multiples of 50 (percentage wise) to about +/- 200% interpolation is generally not an issue in my experience.   It can get dicey at +/-150% in certain original frame rates, but when you are shooting progressive usually you are good to go.   But, your way is one hindered percent valid. Imo, it's 6 of one, .5 dozen of the other."

It's always best to export a master, full rezz file and transcode to lower sizes from that, there will be less quality loss depending on your format.   Imagine taking a full size picture, saving it as a thumbnail and then trying to stretch it back out to full size or larger. It will look awwwwl shitty."
editors,3cykif,LochnessDigital,8,Sun Jul 12 00:05:05 2015 UTC,"He's not asking about blowing it back up to 6k for delivery.   He's asking if there is any noticeable difference to exporting 1080p from a 6K sequence with 6K files or exporting 1080p from a 1080p sequence with 6K files.   He's reframing in the sequence either way. Since the end product is 1080p, I think either way is fine, as long as he doesn't punch in more than 1:1. Which is quite a bit of leeway, 6K is 9 times the size of 1080p."
editors,3cykif,LochnessDigital,3,Sun Jul 12 00:36:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks! - yes, that was what I was asking. I won't be punching in anywhere near that as well."
editors,3cykif,soundman1024,2,Sun Jul 12 01:22:14 2015 UTC,"You might want to do a short test, but I don't think it'll make a difference.  Just to elaborate on my thought process from the last comment: The important thing to remember is that editing is a non-destructive process. So when you're punching in, that's not exactly a ""loss"" of resolution until you export.   Exporting to 1080p, your 6K native stuff will be downsampled to 1080p and the punched-in 6K stuff will be downsampled from probably around 4K-3K worth of pixels (depends on how far you punch in, of course) down to 1080p.  Editing in a 1080p timeline is doing the same thing. Pixels aren't being thrown away or downsampled from the 6K files until export.  So there's really no reason not to edit in the native resolution, provided the computer can handle rendering the previews."
editors,3cykif,LochnessDigital,2,Sun Jul 12 03:08:25 2015 UTC,"A massive difference is rendering previews. If you use a pile of effects you'll need to render for playback. The Mercury Playback Engine is incredibly powerful and efficient, but it has its limits. If you have a 6k timeline it will make 6k previews. If you have a 1080p timeline it has substantially fewer pixels to render for previews.  Unless they were shooting 6k on set to get mediums and close ups at the same time I would consider editing and finishing in UHD or even 4k (4k being 4096x2160, the aspect of your footage, UHD being 3840x2160, the popular standard that's used by TVs, YouTube, etc.) then delivering UHD and a downresed 1080p. Very much a shot in the dark suggestion. Editing at UHD gives you a master that's much better than HD and still gives some room to reframe a bit in post. It's a way to leave the project ready for the future when UHD is more common place while keeping some benefits of shooting larger than you're delivering.  Ultimately your producer should have a reason for shooting 6k when you're delivering HD. See if you can figure out what that reason is. If they have zero interest in UHD and 100% interest in seeing you push into the 6k footage then set your timeline at 1080p and enjoy turning mediums into close ups."
editors,3cykif,greenysmac,3,Sun Jul 12 00:43:42 2015 UTC,"I was not the DP/Producer for this project - but shooting in 6K HD on the Dragon is, I believe, preferable not for the resolution alone per se - but because RED's shoot on smaller resolution sizes by using less of the sensor. So even if you are delivering in 1080p, 2K, 4K, etc. - you willw ant to shoot in full 6K if possible because the capture is highest quality."
editors,3cykif,soundman1024,2,Sun Jul 12 01:24:43 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but with a bayer-pattern sensor, you're not really getting true 6K detail. Shooting 6K and downsampling to 4K will give a true 4K full debayer."
editors,3cykif,D1r3ctor,2,Sun Jul 12 03:21:42 2015 UTC,"I apologize for being pedantic. You're one of the smarter persons in this community.   Premiere Pro's default is to make all previews in (more or less) 1080 - based on the sequence preset. And even if you choose build from clip, it's always a smaller size. And it doesn't get used anyway, unless you specifically tell it to."
editors,3cykif,bottom,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:53:55 2015 UTC,I suppose working in 1080 most of the time has lead me to mistakenly believe the preview followed the sequence.

editors,3cykif,D1r3ctor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:53:51 2015 UTC,it never bothers me because I always round trip out to Resolve. So scale to frame size helps to keep the sizing information.

Then if you need to punch in, you can do so as you please. But if you hit ""Scale to Frame Size"", it will resize the footage, but then consider that 100%. If you need to punch back into a 100% crop of the original footage, you actually now need to scale the footage up to 150%. I've played with this and had the same results as the above link."
editors,3cy8l3,strongasanoak,3,Sat Jul 11 21:26:06 2015 UTC,"I would use Adobe Media Encoder. You can save a preset for output so no matter which format you put in, you can batch transcode. If you want to relink everything at the end it really helps to have your transcodes folder match the original file structure, if you do this, when you go to upres you only have to re-link one file and Premiere does the rest. Otherwise set it up however you want (maybe just by camera type), Premiere has gotten really good at this over the last year or so, it might not matter too much but if you don't match it exactly you may want to upres by bin/folder, especially if there are duplicate file names. So once you have your output folder all set up you would like it... - Import one format - Change all the settings to the proxy format you want - SAVE THIS SETTING AS A PRESET!!! - Select all and set destination folder - Import the next batch of files - Select all of them and change required dropdown boxes to Quicktime and then the ProRes Codec, go to presets, select the your shiny new proxy master, set appropriate output location - Repeat    Hope this helps!"

editors,3cy8l3,Namisaur,3,Sun Jul 12 01:39:01 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, transcoding to ProRes 422 or 422 HQ means you won't have to relink any of the non-Red Dragon footage.  The quality of your non-Red footage will not be changed whether you use the original files or the ProRes transcodes, so there is no reason to relink those.     Transcode everything to 422 (HQ is unnecessary IMO). Create new, but simple folder structure containing all of the ProRes footage. Edit using ProRes media. Relink only Red media. Render."
editors,3cy8l3,merchantfilm,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:12:20 2015 UTC,Davinci Resolve is excellent for transcoding.  Not sure how it would handle a couple of the formats since I haven't used them (Nikon mainly).
editors,3cy8l3,greenysmac,2,Sun Jul 12 03:51:29 2015 UTC,"I've never had to work through such a wide range of footage and have never had to do my own ingest with Red footage either. My question is, what is the best way to deal with this?    When dealing with this many formats? Convert to a single unified codec- but keep native sizing. Build proxies from that.  That many formats is a cluster**k waiting to happen.  ProRes, DNxHD or cineform.  Prelude is an offloader. It can copy the media (three copies, right?) - and build a ProRes and a proxy - it just takes time.  Yes, you could use Adobe Media Encoder (btw, Adobe Media Encoder builds presets for Prelude) - but you need to make three copies anyway for safety.  By using Prelude which does read the camera format, you can transcode/add a LUT to restore the RED footage to a 10 bit equivalent.  I wouldn't bother linking back to the originals - but I'd have them if you needed (for safety reasons) to make an additional transfer.  Build your Proxies using PR Proxy - and yes, I suggest leaving the frame size alone."

This is the world of Assistant Editing, and no one wants to show you how to do the most basic of tasks, like bringing in C300 media at 24p, XDCAM media at 60i, and GoPro Black footage at 120fps and making it all look native in an HD1080p23.976 project without ghosting fields or other artifacting.  Learn these things as well as how the Avid manages the media. How to move media/bins from one computer to another."

editors,3cybfj,WhatDoesScrollLockDo,3,Mon Jul 13 09:12:15 2015 UTC,"Copy and pasted an old comment of mine on similar thread. Didn't realize how brunt it was tho haah, but its one way to go.   Precursor, this is the ""traditional"" route. Go to LA or NY. Find a contact in post production. Anywhere, most likely in reality TV or at a post house. Try and get a job as a post PA or digitizer. You'll work on shit for a while, and you'll work nights. You won't do any cutting for a long time. You'll also work your ass off, stay late with the Assistant Editors and learn as much as you can about Avid (that's what most professional environments are gonna be on), make contacts, and figure out your next few steps. Good luck!"
editors,3cybfj,dmizz,3,Sat Jul 11 23:35:53 2015 UTC,"This is the answer if you want to work in TV or film.   I know a bunch of people who have started as sound engineers in the record industry who flipped to editing because they had families and the hours in Record production are even crazier than editing.   I also know some guys who were sound engineers for features (post not production side) who made the switch. So it's totally doable.   In order to really go full throttle you'll either need to figure out how to survive in your local market (and there are a bunch of guys like that on this sub and over at creative cow) or move to La or NY and just jump in.  You may be able to find an editor that is local to you who is looking for an assistant or apprentice. This job still kinda works on that old school apprentice idea of learning from a pro. Whether it's in reality, features, scripted TV or commercials people need assistants."
editors,3cybfj,elriggo44,3,Sun Jul 12 00:31:26 2015 UTC,"Another tip, take the time and learn Avid.   I know this sub has a deep seeded love of all things Adobe, but if you want to work on the high end professional projects, 95% of them are done on Avid.   And an Avid team isnt going to hire a Premier or FCX only assistant / editor and allow them to learn on the job because those people almost always flounder and take up a lot of time and energy from the rest of the team. You don't need to be the best avid guy, just be familiar with it. Cut a few things in Avid (I tell all of my Avid only friends to do the same with premier)  I promise I'm not crapping on Premier. It's a fine program. And I use it at home or on lower end jobs and things that don't require multiple systems connected.   But at this moment, you can make a full on living in features and TV as an Avid only editor in both LA and NY. I don't know of anyone who does that exclusively with Premier. Even the guys I know who work on one big premier show that's 10 months a year have to switch to Avid for the two months they are off the because there just aren't enough Jobs here that call for Premier.   If you aren't planning to make the move to LA or NY then disregard this advice and use whatever program you personally are the most comfortable with because when you are freelancing it's about turnaround as well as skill, you you may as well use whatever you like the best."

This is because the projector is refreshing it's picture at a different start/end of the frame as your camera's sensor. (what /u/JointOperationsCente is trying to explain to you.)  Some cameras will let you adjust this.   Is there a stock PPro (CC 2014 presently) effect to fix this? Or a buyable one? I see ""Rolling Shutter Repair"" but that does not repair this.   No, no and the Rolling shutter is to deal with the refresh on the camera during higher speed action. It won't fix this.   And for next time, do people leave the shutter open longer to deal with this? Maybe I could have forced it open to 1/15th of a sec instead of 1/30th. But I'm not sure how else I could have avoided this artifact.

FCPX got rightfully shit on when it first came out because it left out major capabilities that professional editors actually need to do their jobs correctly. It has now added on many of the features it was lacking. I used it for a couple years before I hit a brick wall with what it is capable of - but that's me. I'm a straight up nerd for Adobe CC - it streamlined my post production workflow in such an intuitive way that, for me, it was a no-brainer. More jobs in my market ask for a comprehensive knowledge of many Adobe suite products because why the hell wouldn't they? I am seeing the occasional ""we need an EXPERT in FCPX"" jobs - and the big dog in TV and film will likely be AVID for years to come. Anyways, try a few if you can and do what clicks with you.

FCPX, Logic, Motion, and Aperture did have the free price tag going for it and it is still a pretty powerful editor for what it is  but I am not seeing nearly as many jobs using it anymore. I am not in a hurry to switch since it has a lot of things I need, but the more I learn about the advanced features the more I keep seeing people saying that it was way easier on Adobe CC and Avid.

editors,3ctyvi,nelisan,7,Fri Jul 10 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"Mostly just little things that all add up to the program just feeling slightly 'clunkier' overall. The fact that hoverscrub isn't implemented other than previewing clips within bins (but then stops working if you want to set in and out points). The fact that the Trim tool in FCPX covers about 3 different tools in Premiere without having to switch between them. Being able to edit WHILE playing back is also really cool in X. You can kind of do it in Premiere, but the playback audio falls out of sync which pretty much defeats the purpose. And just track editing in general while more robust, can feel cumbersome after getting so used to the magnetic timeline. For example, constantly having to enable or disable multiple audio and video tracks every time you want to perform an insert or overwrite can feel like a chore after being able to do it so easily in X (again for much more complex projects, tracks are still probably the way to go). Also, FCPX's multicam function is still superior in my opinion. Premiere does have traditional autosaving (in timed intervals, and you actually have to wait a second every time it saves), but to me the biggest annoyance of the crashing is just losing my train of thought and having to reboot the app which takes a minute and can be awkward when with a client."

But for work-from-home freelance gigs I will decide on the NLE I use based on what's ideal for the job at hand. If it's mulitcam intensive, I'll mostly likely use X. I have never had to start in one and finish in the other though - you can do it with an XML but I usually have enough things like compound clips and effects that wouldn't translate that it's not really worth it.  As far a coloring goes, I usually just use the built in tools but I'm trying to force myself to use Resolve more. I've used speedgrade a bit which seems nice, but I figure I might as well spend my time learning Resolve instead since it's industry standard and works with anything. For titles I'll use After Effects for more complex stuff (which plays better with Premiere obviously), or just the built in tools out of convenience. Neither of which app's are great...  Overall I would say it's really just worth it to learn both - especially since you already know X - so that you can take as many different jobs as possible and have a more diverse toolset for your own projects. They both have their strengths and weaknesses so it's hard to recommend one over the other. At the end of the day, it's all just editing!"

FCPX is not for everybody, and certainly isn't for anyone who bills by the hour, because it's vastly quicker on most projects than either Avid or Premiere.

I guess if you're a do everything yourself editor or a one man crew Premiere is fine, but we have graphics guys that has After Effects & Maya, audio guys that use Pro Tools and a color guy that uses Resolve. FCPX goes to all of them very cleanly, and without issue. We also build complex animations in Motion that are templates in FCPX which is light years ahead of AE integration.   It's stable, and offers features that other NLE's will never inherit due to patent restrictions that Apple owns and you can find a free plugin for most things you need.

If not Kanin, try these things:  1) Use a batch renamer to change the .mp4 extension to .3gp  Or  2) (paste from forums) I know the cause and the solution for this problem. The cause is a wrong AudioType code in the MP4 container. The correct should be 64, but some encoders put this code as 103. To change this I use mp4UI (http://mp4ui.sourceforge.net/). The steps are:   open mp4ui Go to the options tab Disable Add hint tracks, make ISMA compliant, optimize on close and enable Advanced functions/information go to the general tab and open your mp4 file right click on the audio track(s) and choose set properties in the advance submenu in the preset list choose AudioType, change the value to 64 and click OK Click on close and try to open your file with quicktime. It should work. It has worked for me with about a hundred files...   Or  3) Using mkvtoolnix's mkvmerge gui you can mux from mp4 to mkv with no transcoding which takes only seconds and works with Quicktime provided you have Perian installed. It is as simple as selecting the original mp4 and clicking start muxing.  http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/downloads.html#macosx  http://www.perian.org/"

Speedgrade can also lock tracks for movement but allow for color. In-NLE, Premiere can't so be careful and I haven't used Symphony but I would assume because it's Avid, it's quite difficult to move clips unless you have the correct tool selected so it's fairly safe.  That said, you need to QC. When your edit is locked, export out a copy. During ingest for color, place this on top of the conformed timeline and set it to 50% opacity and watch the film. This will catch any issues with the wrong shot being conformed, a shot being conformed at the wrong timecode, etc. Do this process again at the end of coloring if needed."

Lots of people put head pops 2 seconds before start at 00:59:58:00, and some, like me put an actual ""film"" countdown leader and put the pop on the 2, hence ""2-pop"".  Then at the tail usually 2 seconds after the last frame.    The WHOLE point is simply to have an easy sync check.  When your sound guy loads up your video and audio separately he can check the head pop and the tail pop – as long as those are frame accurate, he knows any other sync problems he sees are internal, and not some overall error.  The same goes for you when you color correct and then receive the mix.   You lay it into your sequence and the pops should line up perfectly.  If they don't then something is wrong – you might've accidentally shifted something, the sample rate might be wrong, etc."

You could try a scene a few different ways, drop them into compound clips then load them into auditions.

Went thru the material like normal and marked it up. Then I quickly threw all selects, INTV, OTF, 'reality,' etc. onto a single sequence.

My final audio sounds good to me, but I am positive an audio pro would find it atrocious. Any steps I could make to better my workflow?   Listen to your audio in many different spaces and on many different devices. Audio will sound very different depending on the speakers you're listening to it with, so make sure it sounds OK to you on each and every device you can get your hands on, from high end sound systems to crappy tablets.   I cant seem to find a consensus on broadcast levels. Some maintain the general rule of thumb is to not clip (obviously) but to get as close as you can to -1db. Others maintain they don't let their dialogue levels get past -6 or in some cases -10 db.   That's because there is no consensus. For example: ABC requires us not to peak above -6dBFS, however CBS said we shouldn't go above -2dBFS, and wanted dialogue in the -14 to -8dBFS range. A+E said absolutely nothing over -8dBFS.  There is no consensus, it all depends on your client's specifications, and you should be asking for clear technical specifications from them.  And if you're doing this work for broadcast you need to be extra careful to make sure you're in compliance with the CALM Act, which can be a bit funky if you don't know what you're doing.  I suggest crossposting to /r/audioengineering. They know their stuff over there and can probably answer your questions better than I can."

At the top you can roll it open and do all of this. No need to go to Audition (which his a great tool.)   I cant seem to find a consensus on broadcast levels. Some maintain the general rule of thumb is to not clip (obviously) but to get as close as you can to -1db. Others maintain they don't let their dialogue levels get past -6 or in some cases -10 db.   Generally, broadcast level need to match tone - so about -18 DB as an average, with elements peaking as high as -10. A good compressor really helps.  Backgrounds around -28 or so.   You should never be in that -1 range. Maybe -6...but the lack of dynamic range in broadcast is the major limiter.  And yes, the CALM act (and the LKFS meters) are important."

editors,3cmdd2,sudormrf-,4,Thu Jul 9 06:35:06 2015 UTC,"Rushed delivery I suppose. The studios want their movie done now, and some scenes/shots get ignored or overlooked/forgotten about (whatever it may be) and the movie, like some video games, get unfinished and then the director hopes that either no one will notice (yeah right, not that blatant crap) or it'll ""blend"" into the scene and then (most likely) collectively decides with his team/producers if it's worth keeping in or not.  I'm not defending Michael Bay one bit, but studios have a helluva lot of say when it comes to their movies they just spent 100s of millions of dollars on. (Directors get a lot of grief if their name is attached to a movie whether it's awesome or sucks, it's part of the job they take on whether or not they had much say in it or not.) So MB says fuck it, gives them what they want, a huge movie, (maybe spites the execs and leaves shitty unfinished shots in) and collects his paycheck. MB knows, along with everyone else, but the check writing execs don't know/care/give a shit about a quick shot and it then gets delivered for all of us to witness and tear apart.  I'm also guessing this movie wasn't done for movie sake but more for selling merchandise along side tickets. It suffers from the same thing that happened to Batman and Robin in 1997.  Joel Schumacher didn't want to make the movie that got delivered, he made the movie the studio wanted in order to sell toys. (There's a term for it that he described in a documentary once). Hasbro probably has a lot to say in it and I'm sure their big thing is to sell merch."

Just off-line everything and then re-link by directing premiere to the RAW files instead of the proxies.

Who generally makes more than the post coordinator.   In scripted/union the post coordinator makes much less than an assist and works for the post super coordinating assets. I'd say the assists are ""above"" them but really they are on similar levels of different departments.   Generally the hierarchy doesn't matter you should work with the coordinator whether you think you are above him or he thinks he is above you. It shouldn't matter because the goal is the same. Get the project out the door in the cleanest way possible."

According to MacRumors the Mac Pro has gone 566 days without an update and they feel it's due for one soon. The record for the Mac Pro was 685 days, but that was in The Dark Times when no idea what to expect, and then got that minor rev in CPUs before being hit with the Can Mac.  If you can wait, do wait. Even if you aren't buying new, the introduction of a new model will effect the used market as well.  As far as authentic hardware vs. Hackintosh, remember what the difference is. Hackintoshes can be a little more finicky, and can break with individual OS updates, so you'll have to do a lot more due diligence with that kind of stuff. You also get zero support with one. If it breaks it's 100% on you to fix it, no matter what's wrong. There also comes the issue of legality and licensing, which is where I get squeamish in the professional world."

editors,3ccdl2,CZbwoi,4,Mon Jul 6 20:31:36 2015 UTC,"It seems I have solved the mystery on my own, I think. Show Audio Time Units needs to be turned on to see the real time of your project, because if you're editing files like mine(23.976) those aren't able to be displayed in the sequence.  The display format for projects in sequences(accessed by going to Sequence>Sequence Settings) only allows for 24fps, 30fps with a Non-Drop-Frame, Feet + Frames 16mm/35mm, and Frames. So if your files or project isn't one of those, the display will be off, as it's trying to convert and display the time into one of those(24fps by default).  This is where turning on Audio Time Units comes into play, as it shows the final and real time of the project based on...well, audio. And audio, including silence in videos(if you have that at the start or the end like I do), is still judged by seconds. So this will display the real final time of your video in seconds, which is how we describe audio, and not on frames. So the whole duration of the video regardless of silence will be shown in the format of how we read audio, in it's time units: seconds and milliseconds.  I made a quick Imgur album tutorial here about what I did, in case you missed clicking it up top.  It seems like I was under the illusion that the time was off because I was being shown the duration of my project in Premiere based on frames and not audio seconds. Which I obviously knew, but didn't comprehend because I was unaware of the 23.976 to 24 shift, I didn't realize the display format wouldn't stay at 23.976... I mean, why wouldn't it stay the same as it was imported...? Lol.  So everything is A-OK."

Did you change the frame rate at any point? (Importing at 29.97 for something that was shot 23.98?)  Did someone else process your dailies? Did you shoot on film and have it transferred to tape/qt files?  This sounds like the equivalent to a bad telecine. Did you shoot in 24 and are outputting to 30/59.98?

If they don't list this, then you need to ask because you might then have to pay for studio record time as well. When you're asking about rates/quotes, I would ask them to quote you a pickup fee as well, or if it's included, etc.  Finally, always supervise the record via phone patch. Timings, pronunciations, general tone, etc can all be taken care of on the fly. When you're done, the VO artist will generally punt you sound files (whatever flavor you want) via file transfer or FTP. Easy cheese."

Becoming a producer usually involved interning as an executive assistant or a general production assistant, and working your way up the ladder from there.

We treat the source files as being immutable things, to be preserved and dutifully cared for. We can manipulate them in the NLE, but we never do anything to the original source files.  Disturbing the file structure will make it impossible for some NLEs to ingest the media, and therefore it's basically like taking the reels out of a cassette for storage. In theory it'll work, but good lucky keeping it safe or using it in a deck.  Not only that, but you're breaking the connection to a lot of metadata, and we want to maintain that connection if we ever need it for whatever reason. A dispute about who was where when, or to easily find all clips from a certain time, or being able to figure out which camera was used on what shoot, things like that.   What do you guys do to have them a bit more organized?   We use bins and comments. In some cases we rename the clips after import, but at that point you're just manipulating metadata in your project and not actually changing the files.   Would this mess anything up?   Depending on what software you're using, yes, it can be disastrous.   Or stick to the regular file structure and just log with comments?   Do it this way."
editors,3camzu,Kichigai,3,Mon Jul 6 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"You'll find that most people use the folder structure for organization, re-enforcing with other information like shoot date, treating the camera's card/reel as one solid folder that will not be broken down further.

Also be aware that there is an extremely low chance of name collision, RED files have a portion of the name that is just a random string, if you know the full file name you should only get one search result on your system.  For other formats like AVCHD and XDCAM you can cause real problems if you break the memory card's folder structure or rename files. Screwing with camera originals is a bad strategy, even with ""safe formats"" like H.264 from something like a GoPro.... it just leads to inconsistent behavior, messing with some, not messing with others. It'll screw you more often than you think it's helpful.  Leave file names alone, use non-destructive renaming(metadata) in your application of choice (All NLEs and apps like After Effects allow you to rename files in your bins without changing what is on your disk)."

If I were you I would consider waiting it out another laptop generation/2 years and you'll be better off if your focus is mobile. Heck, just now desktops are able to reliably handle a larger portion of the pipeline in 4K so laptops are always going to lag in power.  I would consider updating the camera now and then transcoding down to 1080 to edit and deliver; you'll see image quality gains even when delivering in HD over your current camera. You won't get immediate pressure to deliver in 4K over the next year or two, unless you're solely shooting for yourself.  A more modest update to something like a late 2012 MBP or equivalent will tackle 4k transcoding and more reasonable export speeds (working offline to online) if you occasionally need to deliver to 4K.

If you're staying mobile then you're not really jumping into the world of 4K. We've got old Mac Pros in the office that can kind of handle 4K. You're kind of just walking into 4K.   Can you recommend an option that will handle 4K editing and be ""future proof"" for the next 3 years as 4K gear penetrates the market?   No. Three years is a fairly long time for a laptop, and we're talking about media and workflows that are still evolving. A given laptop right now might groan, but function, under a ProRes or maybe even an XAVC 4K workflow, but if a camera using H.265/HEVC comes out it might not be able to cope with that.  So it's a combination of the fact that you're locked into your hardware, which is on the lower end of handling 4K from the start, and the fact that there is a lot of uncertainty about the nuts and bolts looking three years down the road.   I work with Premiere, but I hear FCPX is works better for 4k editing on Mac. Any truth there?   From what I've heard, yes, but I don't know if I'd count out Premiere. FCPX handling 4K was the ""star"" demo that Apple was pushing at the Mac Pro launch, so it's unquestionable that they've been working on this hardware longer.  So Apple seems to have dumped a ton of money into improving OpenCL support in FCPX, as they knew that the new Mac Pro was going to use AMD GPUs, whereas Adobe seems to have focused more on supporting CUDA, as it was the GPU of choice in Apple's laptops.   BONUS: Any 4K camera preferences that are <$5k?   The Panasonic DMC-GH4 is considered to be way up there in the DSLR/MFT world, but people seem to like the Sony A7s too. Some next generation of Canon C100 is rumored to do 4K, but whether it's this upcoming one or the one after that is unknown. The Blackmagic Cinema Camera isn't bad, but its controls are commonly criticized. The URSA looks like a friggin' beast, but beyond that I don't know much. Beyond that, I don't hear much, I just know that Panasonic historically tends to make great cameras that not only produce a good quality image, but also have physical designs that are great for field use."

editors,3camzu,jamexxx,3,Mon Jul 6 16:07:48 2015 UTC,"A few ways. Premiere will usually respect the channel layout of the file first. In other words, your file is probably tagged as stereo audio even though the L/R tracks are iso's from different mics.  You can set the default behavior of all stereo audio files to come in as multichannel mono. Preferences > Audio > Default Audio Tracks > Change Stereo to ""use mono"".  Of course, as you import true stereo files like music and SFX, you'll need to right click them and go into Interpret Footage > Audio channels and reassigning it 1 audio track, stereo.   The amount of true stereo audio that makes its way into an editorial project is usually pretty low for me, and hopefully for you, so switching this default behavior is great."

Feel free to answer some and not all of these questions."
editors,3camzu,kissmyrobot,2,Mon Jul 6 18:02:38 2015 UTC,"So for every second of video, bitrate controls how much storage space you can use to store it. More bitrate = more storage space = less compression. Variable bitrate, without getting too deep into how it analyzes quality, allows some flexibility: using more data when a portion of video is complex and using less when a portion of video is very simple; CBR uses the same amount of data for each portion of time which may over-compress complex scenes and waste bits on less complex scenes. ""Limit Data Rate"" you'll see for Quicktime h.264, consider it a ""target"" bitrate or quality. If you don't limit this, then Quicktime's terrible h.264 encoder assumes ""high quality"" and will use a bitrate suitable for the complexity of the video... it's 1-pass VBR. ""Render at maximum bit depth"" is for color depth (fidelity), and is not related to bitrate. This is, again, a Quicktime specific setting (some codecs may or may not have this setting and it may be called something different) and reflects the fidelity of color operations during compression/encoding. If given the option to render in 48 bits, like ProRes, you should. This is 8-bit or 16-bit color fidelity (24/3 and 48/3, for R,G and B color channels). Since ProRes stores color values as 10-bit (some cameras can spit out 12-bit ProRes HQ4444, but that's rather new) then doing some intermediate color calculations at 16-bits maintains color fidelity and can prevent artifacts like color banding... at the expense of encoding speed. Again this is internal to the Quicktime encoder and is different from Premiere's ""Use Maximum Render Quality"" which kicks in a whole host of quality settings. ProRes is, by its nature, VBR. Outside of a debugging environment, CBR ProRes does not exist. This is why you aren't given an option. Other codecs will vary as well, this isn't a universal thing. Frame Bending is used to blend frames if the timeline framerate is different than the export framerate. Depending on the footage, it may look better or worse. This is similar to having the frame blending turned on a single clip if that clip has a different framerate than the timeline. If the timeline and the export setting are of the same framerate then the Frame Bending setting on the export window does nothing. h.264 encoding works by storing full frames of video called keyframes. Part of compressing video is choosing a number of frames in between each keyframe that represent the difference in change between keyframes, they aren't whole frames. Keyframe distance is another way to set quality or use bitrate more efficiently. A keyframe distance of 1 is the same as intraframe encoding, storing every frame as a full frame but it takes an increased bitrate to do that. A longer distance of, say 60, may give you a better overall image quality for a really low bitrate video. For web video with a modest bitrate of 5mbps to 9mbps I think most people will agree that a keyframe distance equal to your framerate is quite acceptable."

However, it seems that answers have lead to more questions, so I have a couple of follow ups:   ON PRORES: Great to know; ProRes is natively VBR. Based on your description of data rate, could I control it's ""target bitrate"" by adjusting a ProRes file's data rate limit? For example: a company wants a ProRes file at ~220Mbps could I then set the limit to 220,000kbps? This seems like a ridiculous number.  Follow up for a follow up: Premiere's ProRes codec settings grey out the data rate limit at 6,000... what gives? ON DATA RATE LIMITTER: Unless I am misreading your answer... are you saying that because of Quicktime shit h264 encoder, one should try to limit the data as much as one can? That without it, it's only 1-Pass? If this is the case, it leads me back to my question above: what do I do when I want a higher target bitrate? Are insanely high kbps numbers acceptable? ON MAX RENDER QUALITY: Think you could expand a little more on the difference between Quicktime's native encoder and Premiere's ""Use Maximum Render Quality"" checkbox?    Once again, please feel free to answer some, not all of the follow up questions."
editors,3camzu,kissmyrobot,2,Mon Jul 6 20:01:39 2015 UTC,"No, ProRes does not allow for deep user control overbitrate. As mentioned in another reply, you're choosing quality level and letting the codec do the rest. https://documentation.apple.com/en/finalcutpro/professionalformatsandworkflows/index.html#chapter=10%26section=4%26tasks=true As far as the greyed out setting, it's not available to change so ignore it; the value does not reflect any ProRes setting. If you do not check that box, Quicktime's H.264 codec assumes a constant ""quality"" which can generate unpredictable bitrates and file sizes. When the box for ""limit data rate"" is checked, it keeps the bitrate under greater control. Regardless of the checkbox, this codec always works in 1-pass VBR mode (really poorly), it has no CBR mode. But yes, generally, Quicktime's h.264 encoder is poor in comparison to MainConcepts (the other h.264 encoder in Premiere) or x264 at the same bitrate. Quicktime can possibly upsample color only during the encoding/compression step. Premiere's setting does it before it enters the encoder, so it's codec agnostic. Premiere's setting increases the quality of blurs and other certain effects, uses an improved scaling algorithm and does its color corrections, blends, and transitions in 32-bit color per channel. If you're using GPU acceleration on export or in Media Encoder CC, then color blending is done in full 32 bits per channel regardless of if this box is checked; in other words, really only useful for upscaling exports."

editors,3camzu,ziwzih_oo_oo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:35:01 2015 UTC,"What is the difference between the VBR/CBR Mbps and the ""Limit data rate to"" Kbps at the bottom?   VBR = Variable Bitrate CBR = Constant Bitrate  So when you run VBR you're telling Premiere to use something around your specified bitrate. The Limit Data Rate option tells it where the ceiling is, otherwise it's a soft ceiling. Some codecs also don't have bitrate settings, and instead operate on a qualitative scale, and this will put a ceiling on the bitrate.   What does it mean to ""render at maximum bit depth,"" wouldn't you not be doing that the second you select a data rate number?   Bitrate/Data rate determines how much data is used to describe a given amount of footage. Bit depth, however, is about color information. Rendering at maximum bit depth basically says to save as much color information as can be done with the export format at hand.   Why can ProRes only export in 24 or 48-bit?   Video comes in 8, 10, 12 or 16 bits of color information per channel. Most video is 8-bit, so 8-bits of color information for three channels (red, green, and blue) makes for 24-bits of total color information.  48-bit is where things get goofier as the Adobe's phraseology is ambiguous. However if you were working with 10-bit material you would want to use 48-bit. Most video is 8-bit, though, so you won't really gain anything by necessarily jumping up to 48-bit.   Why cant I select a VBR?   ProRes operates in a qualitative mode, where it determines how much data it needs to use in order to function as a ""virtually lossless"" codec. Therefore it doesn't give you the option to set your data rate as that would interfere with that functionality.   Please ELI5 keyframe distance and frame blending. I've read about them but I still have trouble wrapping my head around it. Apparently it's only useful when you have mixed framerates? No?   These are two very different, and completely unrelated things.  Keyframes have to do with Inter-frame compression formats. These formats start with a full, complete frame, technically called an I-frame, but colloquially known as a Keyframe. That is then followed by B- and P-frames, which describe the changes in the image since the last frame. The Keyframe distance determines how many B- and P-frames are used before the next Keyframe is put into the sequence.  Frame blending has to do with changing a frame rate. It will interpolate the missing visual information from the surrounding frames to make it appear smoother and reduce motion jutter. This is also known in some programs as Optical Flow or Motion Interpolation."

editors,3camzu,nikdog,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:18:12 2015 UTC,"In theory, setting a maximum data rate would control the data rate, except the ProRes codec provides no facility by which one could do this. Third party codecs can do this, but it's not recommended. The codec's algorithm is pretty good about using only as much data as it needs.  To see an example of this try encoding 30 seconds of color bars and then encode 30 seconds of some random footage. The bars should come in pretty small compared to the footage."

This does disable any rendering or processing of the clip, which can definitely free up CPU cycles and RAM on a slow computer.  Just out of curiosity, what are the specs of your computer? Namely, the model, year, processor and RAM. They're all listed under About this Mac.  I run FCPX on a 2010 MBP, a 2012 rMBP, and a 2013 trashcan MP. The program runs smoothly on all three (render times increase going back though). The 2010 computer needed a RAM upgrade from 4GB to 8GB to keep the interface from lagging with h.264 footage."

I accidentally turned off enabling on half the clips and the sluggish response times were gone.   You just answered your own question. H.264 is very processing intensive to edit as it's an inter-frame compression scheme. You've got one full frame, and then for the next 12 to 120 frames (could be any value in that range, or beyond) it's just little updates as to what's changed. So to view any given H.264 frame it has to decode that entire range of frames in order to reconstruct the one. By disabling those clips you no longer have this huge swath of stuff that has to be decoded.  This is why most people prefer to work in ProRes and DNxHD, which are intraframe compression schemes and are much easier to decode."

Not saying issues with premier are inevitable. Just issues when switching from anything that has been working well to something new. There are always growing pains and/or learning curves.
editors,3cazz8,EntGent,3,Mon Jul 6 14:52:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Stick with Avid if time is tight. But I switched from Avid to Premiere last year, and the workflow is incredible! I will outline my basic workflow below:  The beauty of Premiere is the ability to work on your sequence with multiple applications, all without saving, rendering, or exporting. This work flow is called ""Dynamic Linking"".   After cutting your sequence, you can edit your effects by right clicking on the clip you want to add an effect to, and select ""Replace with After Effects Composition"". This will automatically open the clip within After Effects, enabling you to perform a live effect edit, without saving or rendering. Your changes will be applied instantly in Premiere, assuming you have enough computing power.   You can apply this same workflow with your color grading. Simply select file > ""Direct Link to Adobe Speedgrade"". Make sure you have Speedgrade installed.  Once again, repeat this process for your audio sweetening. Right click on the audio clip you wish to edit, and select ""Edit with Adobe Audition"".  When your sequence is completed, simply select file > export > media. This will bring up the pre-encoding dialog window. I do not recommend exporting directly from Premiere. Instead, select the ""Quene"" option at the bottom. This will prepare the sequence to be rendered and exported in Media Encoder. Make sure Media Encoder is installed.  Once in Media Encoder, you may select your encoding settings. Video Distribution Codecs are dependent on client requirements and personal preference. Simply select your Codec and file location. Press the Green Play button and you are good to go!  This is a description of my Workflow, so I hope this helps!"
editors,3cazz8,statusquowarrior,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:45:18 2015 UTC,"While it does work great in theory, I find dynamic linking to be useful only to simplify rendering and auto-update to newer file versions.  All my projects have about 10% Dynamic Links for after effects and it gets so slow it's impossible to work. We usually transcode it within premiere(the 2014 newer option) and use it as a video file and not a live link. It'll speed the whole program up."
editors,3cazz8,EntGent,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:06:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear that! Are you sure this is not because of a lack of computing power?

ProRes doesn't let you directly control the bitrate, so don't worry about that. Go for 48-bit depth in this case. It's not going to make much of a difference if you only worked with 8-bit color material, but it won't hurt. ProRes is pretty good about only storing what it needs.   Also, in bitrate settings, ""Limit Data Rate To"" is greyed out at 6,000kbps.   As long as you selected ProRes 422 HQ for your codec don't worry. That's some weird Premiere jargon in this specific instance.   Finally, they want a color space in Rec 709. How do I ensure this with premiere? I've read that it is the default color setting in the program, but my test exports show the color profile as HD (1-1-1)   You're checking it in the Finder, right? That's the only place I've seen that ""HD (1-1-1)"" nomenclature. If you want to know, bring the file back into Premiere and look at it on some scopes. Find the blackest scene you can and see if your blacks are all the way down at 0 out of 255. They ought to be around 16 for Rec. 709."

In production, you can have a 50% kill fee after award up until 48 hours before production, then its 75%.

If it's a really good client and you can book more work for the period or haven't turned down any other work, you could maybe offer him a 50% kill fee. But frankly that's generous. I would charge full freight for the first day or two, and then 50% after for like, a regular client that I wanted to keep, like a big NY agency, and give them the opportunity to sell me off to another project. Kill fees in post apply more to companies who may have scheduled and deployed assets, but still have a cost plus billing structure; so they have some ability to redeploy their talent and replace the work.

editors,3c9rf8,rafbo,10,Mon Jul 6 05:16:43 2015 UTC,"/r/videoediting please, this is a rudimentary question and /r/editors is a sub primarily for working professionals.  Understand this: with a few exceptions, the size of your initial video file will have little to no bearing on the size of your complete, exported file.   Where are you delivering this finished file to?  Simply choose higher quality export settings (predominately increasing the bitrate) and you will get a larger, higher quality file. Start with the Vimeo or Youtube presets. If you're working from a camera original file or some exotic AVI you torrented, you'll most likely end up with a smaller delivered file; this is normal.   Looking at your screenshot, you may be running into CPU issues playing back an h.264 file of that bitrate. 90mbps is megabits per second, not the control of the output file size. Please notice on some file formats that Premiere does give you a estimated output size. For something that is ""web ready"", a 1080HD file shouldn't be set to more than 20-30mbps and that's on the extreme high end of the scale.  Also, even if you were to export at or around the same bitrate as your original file, you still lose quality. This is known as generation loss and is unavoidable in most workflows that deliver content for web use (h.264 and similar codecs)."

editors,3c9rf8,24framespersecond,4,Mon Jul 6 06:36:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly your cpu isn't the problem, your whole computer isn't fast enough to play an h264 at that ridiculous bitrate. Your hard drive won't be fast enough. If you want to export it for someone else to work on it, it doesn't sound too long, just export as Prores or an uncompressed QuickTime. If you're sending it to YouTube or vimeo 20Mbps file will be fine. Don't always worry about the file size but about the quality of how it looks. If it's black text in a  white background for example even if it's at a really high bitrate it'll be a small file size because there isn't much info there."

Almost all of the other ones I recorded one song in its entirety live, and then shot lots of b roll to cut it with, and then I just replace the live audio with clean, mastered audio once I have it, so there should be one file that's way larger than the rest. Zoogma has two full songs recorded with it. I just bought myself a 4 channel field recorder so my live audio will be infinitely better in the future, sorry about that part, guys!

editors,3c4cii,S0mu,8,Sat Jul 4 17:33:11 2015 UTC,"There are specific things that make these shots look different. If you have trouble identifying these differences, then you should look at your scopes. You have to match the highlight and shadow levels on all three shots (use the Waveform or Parade for this). Then your vectorscope tells you what color cast each shot has, and how much saturation.  Quickly though: shot one has higher saturation, and higher contrast. It's also much warmer than the other two. Assuming shot 1 is the reference:    Shot 2 has lifted shadows and is too blue. Warm up the highlights and bring down the shadows to match shot 1. Then lower the midtones a bit. Add saturation. Shot 3 is much darker. Start by raising the highlights. It also needs some warmth and saturation."

Also, will I be able to start noticing these things with time and experience?"
editors,3c4cii,elriggo44,5,Sat Jul 4 18:18:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. Time and experience will massively help. Sadly, some people are born with the gift (or grew up with someone who had a knack for this stuff and passed it on) and most others have to learn it over time.   Interesting study done a while back where scientists were looking for tetrachromats (women who have a 4th cone in their eye that allows them to see subtle differences in otherwise similar colors). For some reason, tetrachromats are mostly women, just like dichromats (colorblind) are mostly men.   The study found that along with tetrachromats, artists and designers and others were able to tell subtle differences that the laymen in the study couldn't.  The people who worked with colors (paint/fabric/video) were able to instantly tell which were more red, which were more green and which were more blue. They were all able to put them in order from most to least R,G and B.   The study was a scientist trying to find someone that was born with extra mutant color sensing cones in their eyes that makes them a super seer (similar to super tasters with tastebuds).   Moral of the story? Some people can naturally tell the difference. But most learn it over time.   If interested, here is a link to a story on tetrachromats. I can't find the study I was talking about, but this is pretty interesting reading.   http://discovermagazine.com/2012/jul-aug/06-humans-with-super-human-vision"
editors,3c4cii,sushiRavioli,3,Sat Jul 4 19:48:12 2015 UTC,"I've been specialising as in colour grading for a few years (I also do motion design and editing). While I did attend a condensed film program, I was already working in this field and I learned most of my craft through experience. I don't think I had any particular talent for colour grading until I started to really explore it.  It is never easy to match different cameras (or to match shots from the same camera taken in different conditions). But once you start doing a lot of it, you start looking at images very differently (I notice inconsistencies in colour grading on TV and in films). You don't just see that the images are different; you can identify by eye what is different and you know what operation you must do to get it in the right ballpark. The white point (how bright the highlights are) and black point (how dark the shadows are) are a good place to start. If these don't match (especially the black point) it won't work.  If you do want to delve more into this, I highly recommend the Color Correction Handbook. It is packaged with a DVD filled with test shots. Once you've acquired the basics Mixing Light is a great place to explore."
editors,3c4cii,wrosecrans,2,Sun Jul 5 01:02:58 2015 UTC,"Also, will I be able to start noticing these things with time and experience?   The way I usually start when looking at an image or comparing images is to look for the brightest thing in the image, and the darkest thing.  That will help you filter out the millions of other pixels and shapes and whatnot that you can't think about all at once, and focus your attention.  You might find it a useful technique.  Pretty much anybody say ""I think the shadow under his arm pits is about the darkest shade in the third image.  Maybe his hair""  without any special training.  Then look at the second image, and you'll see since it's the same subject, the same spots seem to be the darkest places in the picture.  Now you just have two colors to compare instead of two images.  And you'll probably see pretty quickly when you focus your attention just on those spots that the darkest thing in the image is a lot brighter.  And it has a little bit of a blue cast.  Break it down into small chunks like that."
editors,3c4cii,LocalMexican,2,Sat Jul 4 21:54:40 2015 UTC,"As far as process - When I try to match shots, I typically turn to my most out-of-whack shot first, then try and grade that one (shot #2 in your example). I need to know what my WORST shot will be capable of so that I can decide what I want to do with my other cameras.   If I was grading these, I would lean towards matching all shots towards the exposure of Shot #1 and the saturation/color temps of Shot #3.  I would use this strategy first because I think shots #2 and #3 can get pretty close to the exposure of Shot #1, and I like the colors in shot #3 the most.   Keep trying it. Keep practicing, keep starting over every once in a while."

The company has been relisted now and recent stock fluctuations are mostly due to the aquisition of Orad.  Years ago Avid experienced a hostile takeover where an investment firm bought enough stock to take over the board and push the last of the Avid insiders out of the executive ranks.  They then installed Greenfield who spent his five years ""restructuring"" and creating an accounting mess.  Now the new CEO is in, the company seems to be on the mend and he at least seems to have a vision.  Make no mistake, Avid is a public company.

I wish I could give you a solid answer but to be honest it's been at least 5 years since I've had to load anything off of tape and even longer since I've had to do it via firewire to feel confident telling you what's wrong.  For the time being I'd suggest chopping the footage down into smaller and smaller sections and slipping the audio.  Maybe first break it down to a three song set and line up something like a cymbal crash and see if sync holds for all three songs.  If not, just keep breaking it down and slipping the audio until it does.  Tedious but it may be your only option.  Good luck!"

After that, you can ingest/import different types of video formats in their own settings, without compromising your Master Sequence Project settings."
editors,3c2pf3,BeOSRefugee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:25:58 2015 UTC,Yes. That is part of your issue. GoPro shoots a weird frame rate that isn't standard. (Or they did 3/4 years ago when I was working with a lot of gopro) It's actually a variable 30 frames a second where professional shooting and editing formats are strict 29.98 and 23.976.   Do you have any cameras that shot a real format? If so those cameras should sync to the audio. The gopro won't ever truly sync.   The best advice in the thread is the chop the gopro footage into smaller sections that stay synced.   Good luck!
editors,3c2pf3,Smoerbaron,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:44:45 2015 UTC,"If the audio goes out of sync due to dropped frames from the HDV capture (which I've definitely experienced), then I would second NYCajun's advice: chop up the video into smaller sequences and see if you can triage the audio that way. If you can, try to find the individual dropped frames so you can cut around them.  Otherwise, if you're okay spending money to fix the problem, Pluraleyes might help to sync everything together - especially if one or more of your cameras broke up the footage into multiple files. You can download a trial version to see if it solves your problem before paying."

So if you have recorded audio with all your cameras then you would be able to sync everything up nicely with almost no effort.  If you have (or have access to) a mac you could try downloading the free trial of FCPX and use the program to either edit the whole piece or just sync the clips, choose the right audio channel for each clip and the export each clip as single movie-files but with the same starting point.

editors,3bw8i4,reddit787,13,Thu Jul 2 17:43:08 2015 UTC,I think this is the same complaint another previous post had.  The fundamental problem is that it cannot work with the very short transition like Avid's fluidmorph.  Often times the short nature of the transition is what hides it well.   I predict this gets fixed in the near future.
editors,3bw8i4,agent42b,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:15:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, Avid is much better at this.  If I want to close a 1 second gap in someones interview and make it an 8 frame gap, how am I supposed to use a 1 second transition to morph it?"
editors,3bw8i4,fanamana,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:56:28 2015 UTC,"You should be able to increase the transition length the same regardless of 8 frames vs 1 second segment trimmed, as long as you have consistant video on both sides of the cut.  It doesn't work the same as a dissolve, as the magnitude of the effect's manipulation will be greatest at the center of the cut, and the frames most leading or most trailing the cut with little or no manipulation applied. Those frames on either end of the transition are used as samples to predict and form the bridging frames in the center.  What does your source footage look like? Simple talking head?"

My advice is to first understand how morph cut works itself, then shoot the footage to take advantage of how morph cut works. This takes time. The effect is being improved, so it will also get better. For now, just see the troubleshooting guide, linked to below in the post.  Usually the shot won't work because: 1. The shot is not close up enough. 2. The shot is not centered. 3. The head in the shot is cambered. 4. The background is too busy or under lit  The QE responsible for testing this feature wrote the following troubleshooting doc.

The biggest bottlenecks with the 4k that the GH4 pumps out, is that it's h264 - meaning it's hard for the system to decode on older hardware.  Transcoded workflow would mean to transcode to cineform (on a PC) or ProRes (OS X.)  Proxy workflow would me a lower quality bitrate of those two codecs. ProRes Proxy, or the equivalent with Cineform. Something that has a decent image quality, but is meant for only offline editing - at the end, you'd relink to the camera originals for output.  I can get as specific as you like, but I need a bit more detail given the multitude of options."

editors,3bwwo7,FrankPapageorgio,2,Fri Jul 3 01:57:54 2015 UTC,"My issues with 4K footage always involve storage space and playback.  Since I've never had to deliver higher than 1080 so far in my career I will create ProRes Proxy files of the 4K footage at 1080 and just work with those in the sequence. I use FCP7, so I cannot render anything bigger than 4000 pixels anyway which causes some problems.  But on the other hand, since I cannot just simply relink a high res file, I'll blow up the stuff past 100% in the timeline and eyematch it later at the proper resolution.  When picture is locked I'll go back and export the GH4's H264s as ProResHQ files with only a second of handles more than what I need so I have some wiggle room later.  It may seem like a pain, but I think the longest video I've ever worked on with 4K footage has been a 60 second spot, so there is not that much manual online work to do.  The end result is that I have super fast playback on my older FCP7 machine, and save storage space by only converting what I need in the end to a high quality codec.  I'd probably rework my workflow if I wasn't using FCP7."
editors,3bwwo7,loller,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:24:48 2015 UTC,"You're supposed to be editing at 4k and delivering at 1080p to speed up the process, but that can get tricky when you want to stabilize several shots. You'll need to do it in After Effects because the Premiere version of Warp Stabilizer will tell you that your clip in the 1080p sequence needs to match the frame size, which means you have to nest it, which can get annoying.   Are you having playback issues with the 4k when it gets over 3 minutes long? What about a mixture of other codecs in the sequence?"
editors,3bwwo7,EntGent,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:20:32 2015 UTC,"Premiere will always prompt you to ""change sequence settings"" when importing a clip to a new sequence. However, in a 4K to 1080 workflow, I create a new sequence, selecting the DSLR 108030p sequence type.   Once you add the 4K clip into the timeline, the clip will be zoomed in. Under the ""Effect Controls"" of the 4K clip, the scale will be listed at 100%. This is because Premiere thinks of the 4K clip as a 1080 clip. Simply reduce the scale to fit your 1080 frame. This allows you to reframe the shot without any distortion.  The beauty of Premiere is the ability to work on your sequence with multiple applications, all without saving, rendering, or exporting. This work flow is called ""Dynamic Linking"".   After cutting your sequence, you can edit your effects by right clicking on the clip you want to add an effect to, and select ""Replace with After Effects Composition"". This will automatically open the clip within After Effects, enabling you to perform a live effect edit, without saving or rendering. Your changes will be applied instantly in Premiere, assuming you have enough computing power.   You can apply this same workflow with your color grading. Simply select file > ""Direct Link to Adobe Speedgrade"". Make sure you have Speedgrade installed.  Once again, repeat this process for your audio sweetening. Right click on the audio clip you wish to edit, and select ""Edit with Adobe Audition"".  When your sequence is completed, simply select file > export > media. This will bring up the pre-encoding dialog window. I do not recommend exporting directly from Premiere. Instead, select the ""Quene"" option at the bottom. This will prepare the sequence to be rendered and exported in Media Encoder. Make sure Media Encoder is installed.  Once in Media Encoder, you may select your encoding settings. Video Distribution Codecs are dependent on client requirements and personal preference. Simply select your Codec and file location. Press the Green Play button and you are good to go!

I find it hugely easier to set key frames in the inspector.   Just select the aspect you want to key frame in the inspector. Click the diamond to set the existing location or state value. Then move to the ending location on the clip or storyline and set the value there. X will interpolate between the values typically with ease in and ease out if the keyed effect benefits from it.  Some key framing like audio has more automation built in. If you set a range on an audio clip, you can just click on the volume line and drag down. X will auto set 4 key frames - to duck the audio smoothly. Once set, you can drag or reposition the key frames in groups or individually.   When you work in the key frame editor, the pallet floats over the content you are working with, but it shows multiple values in a list, so the display gets kinda crowded. That's why I prefer to key frame in the inspector rather than in the KFEditor.  That's a start."

Called up AJA and even though the thing was still way out of warranty they sent me the gear I needed to diagnose the issue anyway. Did it all at no charge, too, not even shipping (we did have to pay return shipping, though).  So like Apple you're not paying the premium because of the metal and silicon. You're paying because of the reputation and the reliability. You can get a Blackmagic card for cheaper than a comparable AJA card, but how many posts do you see around here complaining about compatibility issues cropping up from time to time? Now how many do you see about AJA gear?  It's not a rip-off. That extra money is buying reliability and service.  That being said I do hear a lot of good things about Atomos hardware, so in this case I would recommend at least doing a price comparison against renting one of their units.

editors,3bwvw1,agent42b,3,Fri Jul 3 12:12:24 2015 UTC,"Um... Thanks for the unbiased advice? For the record, our experience with industry standard delivery methods for the broadcast networks we've served in the last two decades have been exclusively Avid.   Not to pick a fight, but we've delivered content to three different broadcast networks and three or four cable channels, none of them have asked for DNxHD. They all want either tape or ProRes and will begrudgingly accept XDCAM in extreme circumstances.  ProRes unfortunately is the industry standard right now. At least until JPEG-2000 overtakes it.   This is a small client outside our normal scope of clients.   That's fair enough, though. Just do a CYA, though. For example, ABC specs clearly spell out in plain English that only officially licensed ProRes encoders may be used for the deliverable, and ffmpeg isn't one. If they don't say anything about it, you're in the clear.   I swear, you Apple-heads... One day you'll realize that a PC-based Avid is the most beautiful thing in the world   I'm a right-tool-for-the-right-job kind of guy, and at home I run Windows and Linux. Our office is, except for the voicemail machine, one ancient box, and my cell phone, 100% OS X. If anything I'm the Windows advocate over there, and I have to say that we'll probably never be 100% PC. It may some ancient old 1st gen Mac Pro with a dusty copy of Final Cut Pro 7 on it, but ProRes has too strong a grip on the industry for us to ever let it go.  Also PC-based Media Composer sucks compared to OS X Media Composer. It's obvious their development priority is OS X. I've run into way more interface quirks in Windows than OS X, and that's before we even get into the weirdness that is the fact that there are no floating windows. Even GIMP has floating windows in Windows, why doesn't Media Composer? It makes life hell if you don't have matching monitors (like I do on my home setup).  The performance is good, but it's (slightly) less stable and it's goofier to use. Not overpoweringly so, not even so much that I wouldn't recommend it (PC Media Composer is perfectly good for day-to-day use) but if you spend enough time with the two the differences become very clear.   (looking at you, trashcan MacPro with no PCIe slots).   Preaching to the choir. As I said, we're a 100% Apple shop, but even when the company owner, who's not all that technically inclined, saw the new Mac Pro he was taken a bit back. We've got a good chunk of money sunk into our PCIe cards, and have zero Thunderbolt gear.  Retooling our setups would mean gutting our machine room. Even the monitor cabling would have to be replaced, as a lot of suites are using old VGA-over-CAT5e links. Some don't even have monitors with DVI ports. Upgrading would essentially neuter our Nitris DX boxes, and spending almost as much as the computers themselves to get new AV I/O gear and Fibre Channel gear (or a PCIe card cage with enough room).  On the up side, though, it's given me some leverage to push us towards PC hardware. The lack of a proper upgrade path in the OS X world has made some inroads in peoples' minds, but they still have a sour taste in their mouths from their last dabbling in Windows where they suffered a major security breach (in the pre-SP1 days of Windows XP, under a half-competent admin)."

But you can't beat how easy ProRes is. It just works and you could argue otherwise but the industry as whole loves and accepts ProRes.  Only time my post house wishes we had a PC is when clients want AVIs or WMV files and won't budge. But I got one at home so I can always make a file there if I have to.   ProRes unfortunately is the industry standard right now. At least until JPEG-2000 overtakes it.   I didn't know JEPG-2000 was going to overtake ProRes? I was thinking Cineform might have a chance.

I think you guys made the mistake of not recognizing the client's core needs. The core need here is that whatever you've edited is not matching the idea the client saw in their brain. If the client said ""I think you should just give me the footage and I'll edit it myself"" you guys should have responded ""We'll be glad to send you over the footage to review, and you're more than welcome to cut something together so you can show us what works. You did hire us to complete the deliver of the video so we ask that if you cut something together that you like, to hand it back to us so we can use our skills to polish it and deliver a final version"". Then send over watermarked footage.  If, after watching the footage they come back and say ""what the hell, its all shaky and looks terrible!"" then you just reply with ""Well, that's another reason you've hired us. You've seen the quality of our work in the previous video revisions, we have the skills to make those less than perfect shots look great. That's why we insist in polishing up anything you may cut together.""  As it is now, your client has a complete lack of trust in your work. I would look at the contracts signed to see how early termination will work. Who owns the footage? How is payment handled? How are refunds handled?  Most festivals are multimillion dollar businesses, I refuse to think you could have been hired without some contract, be it yours or theirs. If contracts are really vague about early termination then you may need to familiarize yourself with how de facto contract law works in whatever state/country you're in."

If he wants to edit then fine, but he has to pay you for the edits you've already made. Well, I'm hoping that's in your contract. For future notice, you should never send all of your footage to someone without watermarking it (if you own the footage)."

Or at least I've never heard a production company deny them full use.  In the future, for production, I would ask for 20% upfront. It's less about trusting the client and more about having cash. Production can involve a lot of hiring and rentals. You can't wait for weeks of editing and a final approval, and then Net30 or Net60 to pay your grips and camera rental.  At this point, be extremely helpful and polite. Offer to do everything you can (within your scope of work) to deliver a great video for him. Make sure everything is documented in emails.

Dragging a full bin is part of a really little known feature in Premiere that's actually suppose to mimic some of the ""edit from the bin"" features Avid has, and it's been around for quite a few versions.   When you drag a bin onto a sequence or onto the new sequence icon, it inserts it in ""user order"".  So wtf is user order? Double click the bin so it opens in its own window and switch to icon viewing mode. At the bottom of the bin, by the thumbnail size slider is a set of arrows, these are your options for icon sorting. Don't bother changing them, user order will always win.  Assume you open a bin, you can select a clip, JKL and set ins and outs, drag and reorder the thumbnails in the bin, and then drag the whole bin into a sequence... voila it creates a rough cut without ever loading a clip into the source monitor.  edit: I guess Adobe calls this ""storyboard editing"" and here is a link for a better step-by-step http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=1660200&seqNum=2  Edit edit: the one down side is that ""user order"" builds its initial ordering in the order that the files were imported/dragged in. If alphabetical order is important at this stage then go into list view, alphabetize/sort on column as desired and then move the clips from one bin into another.

In CC2015 all I see is that if you, say, open two timelines in one workspace (the ""editing"" one) and then switch workspaces you may only have one timeline open. It seems like the timelines opened in each workspace is persistent and unique as you cycle through the workspaces. I'm not certain if this is a bug or a feature; it would make sense to some people that I'd like to switch from editing one timeline to coloring another so having the ability to have unique timelines open in each workspace would be advantageous."

But again, as long as everything matches across systems, I am good to go."
editors,3bsx28,elriggo44,2,Thu Jul 2 02:47:01 2015 UTC,"you can use spaces, but it will likely break something, notably in Interplay, cross-platforms environments with project sharing, and in an AMA workflow when the ISIS is the AMA target."
editors,3bsx28,Stingray88,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:56:46 2015 UTC,There you go. I know there was a version of unity that wouldn't allow spaces at all but it is because it used an NT or XP server.
editors,3bsx28,elriggo44,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:04:15 2015 UTC,"yep, windows doesn't like spaces in UNC paths or URLs, even in win7. though sometimes it will translate a network path with spaces by adding ""%20"" where a space would go. outlook, for example, does this when attempting to insert a UNC path into an email (at least in an exchange environment, i might be a GPO option.)"
editors,3bsx28,Stingray88,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:23:08 2015 UTC,Mac doesn't like the %20 which is why spaces are a problem for unity. Not so sure about Isis. I haven't been an AE since ISIS became the thing. But I do know that I have never worked on a show that used spaces. I thought it was a holdover from the unity days.   Thanks for the info!
editors,3bsx28,Stingray88,2,Thu Jul 2 15:39:55 2015 UTC,Well it certainly wouldn't surprise me one bit if anything relating to Avid was ridiculously archaic.  Definitely agree with you about using all caps. There's no good reason to do that outside of abbreviations for show names or something.
editors,3bsx28,Stingray88,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:51:44 2015 UTC,Yeah. The main reason Avid shared storage has some anachronistic rules is that you need to be able to plug in both Macs and PCS (and newer and older versions of the computers and software) to the same system and have them accessing the same projects. It creates for some odd rules.   You have the option to turn of the 27 character bin names but you run the risk of older PCs not being able to open them.   If you don't like avid that's fine. But 95% of the big jobs in LA and NYC are Avid based. It's worth a look.   Just like I tell Avid editors that Premier is worth a learn. Because it can do some great stuff.   But there is no danger of them losing out on work because they didn't learn premiere. So most don't listen to me.   Then you have the older guys who have already lived through a shift from Lightworks to Avid and most of hen from film/tape to digital. So they don't want to learn another new system.
editors,3bsx28,LocalMexican,-1,Thu Jul 2 05:08:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah.

It creates for some odd rules. You have the option to turn of the 27 character bin names but you run the risk of older PCs not being able to open them.   This procedure proves my point exactly about Avid. If this were 2003, this might be a reasonable explanation... but it's 2015. There is absolutely no version of Windows or OS X that would have troubles with spaces instead of underscores that was released passed 1999. I'd say even earlier, but I'm being generous. You'd have to be running some pretty ancient versions of Avid for this to be a real problem... like from the 90s... and thus I'd think you'd have more of a problem then just file names to overcome.  This is the textbook definition of an unrealistic holdover if true, and it's something Avid seems to do better than anyone. Well outside of  Microsoft Windows itself.   If you don't like avid that's fine. But 95% of the big jobs in LA and NYC are Avid based. It's worth a look.   I don't dislike Avid, I just recognize one of its biggest flaws."
editors,3bsx28,soapdealer,2,Thu Jul 2 05:22:37 2015 UTC,"windows can have issues with UNC (network) paths that contain spaces. this is where the tradition of underscores comes from. In a path that contains spaces, it is sometimes translated automatically to fill each space with a set of characters ""%20.""  Other times it breaks.      in file server administration, you settle on the lowest common denominator of compatibility when you need to be cross-platform. putting underscores in a top-level directory path is a small price to pay for every system working."
editors,3bsx28,elriggo44,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:02:28 2015 UTC,"That's not a legit use, it's a poorly written program.  Not saying you shouldn't use the best tools for the job though. You should continue to use underscores if that's what it takes... I just don't see a software fault as a legit use for underscores. It's just a necessary curse, like having to perform an extra step to overcome a bug."

editors,3bsx28,aquasharp,-5,Thu Jul 2 05:48:13 2015 UTC,"As an AE, if someone dumps a sequence in a bin and says ""export and upload this"" and doesn't specify a naming convention, it's going up as whatever the sequence is named .copy.01.copy.01.copy.01 and all.

You clean it up as best you can and then export. And then you tell the editor that you need to know what cut is going out in the future.   Actually, you should know what cut is going out.

editors,3br384,notshawnvaughn,15,Wed Jul 1 13:47:40 2015 UTC,"This is just the tip of the iceberg. The original files came from a Canon 1D C, with audio recorded separately. These files are the ""transcodes,"" and not only do they lack unique file names, they do not contain audio. Any audio. Which is super helpful with the synch sound, especially considering the whole ""no time code"" thing with Canons.  Also, and I don't understand how this happened at all, but the heads and tails of the natives and the transcode do not match up, they range from one to two seconds off. Sometimes, the transcodes have more footage not on the camera files. The only thing I can image is that the ""transcodes"" were made with something like an Oddssey 7Q, in which case, why the hell did they even have a dedicated DIT, why aren't there unique file names, and why is there no audio?  Good DITs can be lifesavers, but I've seen so many that are just hacks..."

It's more that I was supposed to hit the ground running. Instead, I lost the better part of a day to synching and transcoding. And they had already taken away both the scripty and an assist.

At first it was on us and it KILLED my productivity as AE.  We were walking into this scenario from a background where the DIT was managing media on set, but we had well-prepped soft-synched bins and media coming from DI.  Is transcoding a standard part of the DIT's workflow? When there is no real DI vendor? I'd thought our guy on the current project was going above and beyond at the time..."
editors,3br384,kissmyrobot,2,Wed Jul 1 21:06:40 2015 UTC,In scripted we have had DIT companies for at least 8 years. There are a few that are top notch. They do color in resolve on set then they transfer the resolve project to the home base (on a drive usually) where the  company takes the resolve project and touches up the color and renders out MXFs (or ProRes or whatever the established workflow is) they then synch audio and name all of the shots.   Then they create all of the DVDs/isos for delivery to the set and network.   Lastly they separate circle takes and BNEG and Aspera the final work onto our ISIS or onto a drive connected to an ISiS gapped computer (depending on network rules or Production preferences).   A good DIT is going to be hard to find if you don't hire from one of these companies because no just out of college kid is going to understand the workflow enough to do the job properly. They will just do whatever the director asks and think they crushed it. Whereas these companies will teach the proper workflow to the new guys.
editors,3br384,Kichigai,9,Thu Jul 2 00:47:17 2015 UTC,"With the exception of A-list film shoots, a DIT role is very new territory.

So don't be surprised if the on-set team expands. DIT, logger, pre-colorist, daily's editor, archivist  - who knows what tomorrow's crew will look like. After all, spending 20% more in the field make perfect sense if it saves ten times that amount in post. Just my 2 cents."

Stage two is always that the downstream users have to be trained in the new system and figure out how to use it to leverage results. As an example, After I adopted FCP X, I had to learn about how its range based keywording functioned. But even after I understood how it worked, I had to develop my own system for using it efficiently. In fact my first big Multicam - a 14 camera music video shoot - I wasted two whole freeking days range-keywording performances by instrument - only to realize that I was being an idiot. I only needed to keyword for performance and take cuz I was going to post live switch it. Part one was learn the capabilities. Part two was to learn to USE them to save effort. In this context, part one is to push metadata collection into the field. Part two is to set up the editing suite to not only read it, but to allow the editor time and training on how to use it to save time and effort."

editors,3br384,procrastablasta,7,Thu Jul 2 16:53:12 2015 UTC,"We did a special for a certain educational cartoon a little while ago, and it was understood that they had a post facility that would digitize the archive tapes and send them our way on a hard disk. For once we were actually asked what format we wanted it in, and we figured that since these were tapes that were over thirty years, old, and obviously SD, we'd go with 1:1 Avid Uncompressed.  The post house, one with a rather prestigious name, sent us a disk with Avid MXFs of some of the tapes. But no bins. None whatsoever. Also no audio. When I Media Tool'd the content it came up as clips with audio, but the audio was offline. The clip names were also useless. ""New Clip.01"" and ""Some Tape"" were the kinds of names I got. The good news is that at least these things were slated, but some clearly were not captured with timecode, so I actually had to hunt for the slates.  We write back, and say, ""there's no audio. Please fix this."" The next disk comes in with more content, same nonsense names as before, one tape is 1:1 Uncompressed HD, still no audio for anything. When we query them about this their only reply is ""wat do?"" I basically have to write up a technical explanation of ""there's supposed to be files for audio in here, but they're not, someone at your place didn't put them on the disk"" and how I knew all that so he could send it to the post house.  Third disk comes in with mostly the same stuff we got on the last disk, but with a buttload of AIF files randomly strewn around too. Apparently someone somehow captured the audio to OMFI MediaFiles and never thought to look in there. We send this company stuff on D5 for international distribution and they struggled with capturing off of D-2 and DigiBeta and putting it on a hard disk."

That one was a beauty: even the native files didn't have unique files names. We had to rename everything..."

Rather than just straight up saying this DIT sucks (and lets be fair, most DITs are simply loaders or digital utility techs... I come to set, even on small jobs, with at least a calibrated monitor, color charts, and a spot meter) I would simply explain that for future shoots that they need to send a document outlining workflow on set and delivery to post to be approved by you because, as is, this stuff is being delivered without logs or and breakdown of how things are organized and processed and it's costing you hours to sort through it. And don't talk to the director, talk to the producer.  If that document baffles the DIT, then try to ax them, but if they write something out that makes sense then give them a chance. If they bungle it in execution then you have more fodder to get them replaced.  Then again, how hard is it to write in an email ""hey, we're shooting to card and to offboard recorder so start time may not always line up; consider offboard our master and camera card as emergency backup. Offboard recordings will be renamed consecutively to avoid duplicate file names so expect something like cam_date_number.mov. Footage should be recorded as ProRes which you can AMA into Avid, if this is a problem then I can transcode as much as I can to MXF while I'm on set but be aware that it's a one day shoot and the hard drives go back to the office at the end of the night."""

I think you'll have the most luck by stating you're working with clients who are willing to pay more and you're charging your market value to all clients.  Another thing to consider is payment plans or long term work. Would you be willing to negotiate a net 60 instead of a net 30 or payment on delivery if you were to get paid more (this works often as many businesses simply aren't very liquid over a 30 day period)? Would you do this job at this price if you were to sign a long term contract that guaranteed your rate increased over the next three assignments (assuming you work with them quite a bit)?

I generally try to get the specs right, get a couple wrong, ask what the issues were, and fix it. The main thing is that you deliver in a ProRes HQ 1080p format. I notice they didn't ask for a frame rate, so whatever you shot is what you're going to want to use.  You don't have to read anything beyond 5.1 - they're asking for a 5.1 surround sound mix, which takes up 6 audio channels, and on the audio channels below that they want the stereo mix (7+8)  The artwork is 2100x1400, probably posters or screenshots for marketing purposes.  The .scc file is for closed captioning.  The trailer they just want in the same format as the rest of it  And an .iso file is just a dvd file. So if you stuck a dvd in your computer and copied it a certain way, you'd get an iso file that works like a cd (macs use .dmg files).  I can't help you much more without knowing what software you use and what you already have. I do know that they probably don't expect you to do all of that yourself, and if they do your producers will be able to help you.

To the best of my knowledge, Premiere doesn't properly handle surround file delivery, as there is no discrete LFE (subwoofer) channel.

Pro Res HQ 422 - standard codec, you should probably just convert all your footage to this when you get it. A lot of people will give you H.264 codec footage since many DSLRs shoot in that to save space.  1920x1080 - that's just full frame HD, I would assume they shot in that.  5.1 and stereo output specs - they should really be hiring a professional audio mixer to do this at the end. I don't know too many editors that can do a 5.1 surround sound mix. To make it easier in the final mix though, just keep your dialogue, sfx, and music tracks all separate.  Clean artwork - I would clarify this one with them, I'm assuming they want any graphic files that were used delivered on their own at 2100x1400 dimensions, but this is vague.  .scc - its a closed captioning file, they also shouldn't have you doing this. They can either buy software or send it out of house to a place that does this.  Trailer - I don't know why they felt a need to tell you to do it in the same aspect ratio since that's obvious, but they should at least tell you the length they want. Cut it after they approve your final edit of the film.  .iso - Just a disc image file, most DVD burning programs have an option to export this rather than to burn a disc. You'll want to do this after you have the closed captioning file, final audio mixes, etc. It's pretty much your last step.  In summary, it's not that crazy, but you should establish that they need to get a professional audio editor/mixer when the edit is completed and that you won't be doing the closed captioning. Don't let them take advantage of you as a student and expect you to complete the entire post process for them unless they're paying you extremely well. Establish your role up front, and where your limits of that are. That's my advice."

editors,3bi6h3,Kichigai,3,Mon Jun 29 13:37:26 2015 UTC,"This forum post talks a little bit about what a Precompute is. From what I've learned tooling around in the Avid world, a Precompute is a non-clip clip.  My logic will make sense if you think of Avid in the way it has been engineered: as a giant tape deck. Every piece of media comes off a ""tape,"" even when that ""tape"" is a file.  Now, a Precompute is basically a render file. It is the result of something you've done or created from scratch. In the ""big tape deck"" view, it's the output if a video mixer or edit controller. It's a signal on the ouput jack. It is not a tape.  So it's obviously a thing, because it's there, it exists, but it isn't from a tape. This ""signal"" has no tape to call home, so Avid can't chase it back. In the Avid world, it doesn't even really have timecode. It has a series of frames, which you can see in your Timecode window, but it's not ""real"" timecode. So without a tape and without timecode there's no way to match back to anything.  It seems kind of stupid, I know, but that's the way it works.

editors,3bi6h3,kissmyrobot,2,Mon Jun 29 19:55:27 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to put together a workflow for logging a fair amount of footage using Prelude and Premiere Pro (CC 2015). Normally, I work on shorter-form projects where I do the logging myself, but for this project I would need help from an assistant editor.  My current draft workflow is:  Me, on location:   At end of shooting day, ingest/rename/duplicate all footage to multiple external drives using Prelude. Take one copy of footage and load into a Premiere Pro project. Make a new sequence with all audio synced, LUTs applied, multiple camera angles set up side-by-side, burn-in timecode added, etc. Let's call this my ""dailies"" sequence. Render out dailies sequence to low-bitrate .mp4, put in Creative Cloud shared files folder.   Assistant editor:   Dailies file is synced to Creative Cloud shared files folder on asst. computer. Asst. moves dailies file to separate directory to clear space for future dailies files. Asst. opens their copy of dailies file in Prelude. Asst. logs footage using comment markers. When done, asst. backs up Prelude project and exports metadata file to CC shared files folder.   This process is repeated each shooting day.   When I get back from location:   Copy all footage and Premiere Pro project with dailies sequences over to RAID on main editing PC. Copy dailies files and metadata files to RAID as well. Open Prelude, apply metadata files to dailes files. Open Premiere Pro project with dailies sequences, import dailies files.  Use comment markers from dailies files to search for particular clips (via Marker List panel).   The advantage of this workflow is that I could download the metadata while on location and check it on my local copy of the corresponding dailies file.  I'd love to be able to somehow convert the Prelude markers into Premiere Pro sequence markers so I could quickly use the Marker List to go to the exact location of a clip I want, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do that (without manually redoing them them all in Premiere Pro).  So, does anyone know of a quick way to convert the comment markers? If not, are there any suggestions on how to make this workflow more efficient?"
editors,3bi6h3,BeOSRefugee,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:20:25 2015 UTC,Are you only doing save metadata (to XMP)?  I believe all markers should come over if in Prelude you select your clips/bins (all of them or as needed) and right click > Send To Premiere.

The Rough Cut feature allows you to do basic edits and import as a new sequence in Premiere Pro via the Send To command, but (AFAIK) Prelude only generates markers that are embedded in the individual footage files.  I'm breaking out the metadata into a separate file to save on transfer times."

I'm working in fcpx, Should I combine certain parts into compound clips?    If you're comfortable working at 20 minute areas...why not break the job into three 20 minutes sections?   This is how any long form work is done. Film editing, which isn't done on film, is still thought of in 'reels' - to help compartmentalize.  Whether it's scripted or doc based, it still has structure and you should be building the smaller parts of the structure separately.   You really don't want to work on the whole thing all at once, until much later, when you're close to beginning to look at the story as a ""whole"" item.  And no, you don't have to compound clip it.   I've seen some people use markers to help navigate longer sections - but keep in mind that FCPX's marker system is clip specific - so if you move a key clip, you'll be moving it's marker too.   Should I work with proxy files? Is this going to put a strain on my computer having so much on my timeline?   No, but proxy files certainly help the system work much faster in general, and lesson the load; especially with formats like h.264.   Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!   If you haven't explored roles, TAKE SOME TIME and examine how they work. It's a meta-grouping above and beyond just keywording.

You can find decent tutorials for both programs by simply googling, but if it's still not getting through, try Youtube tutorials. Make sure to search for the version of the program that you're running, as there are often some minor-to-major interface differences between versions.

editors,3bfnzw,trikeratops,4,Sun Jun 28 20:24:51 2015 UTC,"Don't put the rushes bin in the editors projects. Just the scene bins. That will force a matchback to the bin in the project.   You should have a dailies/rushes project with those bins and the editors should have a separate project for each episode. (Or segment if it's a reality show). This is the only way I know to force a matchback to the right bin.   Generally avid will matchback to whatever bin was opened more recently. So, if the editors are opening the rush bins after they have cut the scene the link goes to rushes. But it cannot matchback to a bin that isn't in the project that is open."

I totally agree that a separate dailies project makes more sense.  Although, Avid wasn't matching back to the most recent bin -- the editors don't use the rushes bins. If the scene bin was open, find bin would select the clip in the scene bin, if it was closed it would go to rushes. So I guess it was linked to both but the rushes bin had seniority? If it hadn't been linked to the scene bin at all, moving the rushes bin wouldn't have helped -- avid can match back to a bin that isn't in the open project, just gives you an error message telling you it's not in the project :]  thank you again!!"

editors,3bh4sl,purplecowize,8,Mon Jun 29 04:24:51 2015 UTC,"My aim is the 16:9 anamorphic setting for HD   Wait, why? Except for DVCPro HD, HDV, HDCAM, and XDCAM EX, nothing uses an anamorphic format for HD. Not even over-the-air broadcasts.   I just realized 16:9 is filmed in an aspect ratio of 3:2 …  I'm using a Canon 60D for shooting   Then you're not shooting 16:9 using anamorphic. The 60D uses square pixels for 16:9, so you're looking at what's sometimes called ""full raster"" HD (non-anamorphic).   so before having this information I had changed a few things on my sequence setting to 16:9 and other things out of a deep desperation and panic   Well, the good news is you can probably fix this. The easiest way is to make a new sequence at the settings you want and then copy/paste the timeline over.  The bad news is that you're going to have to do a lot of hand conforming to make everything fit in the frame correctly, as the ""motion"" settings will be carried over.   what is the deal with matching up the sequence setting to your imported video.   Final Cut expects that you're shooting in the format you plan to deliver. The older versions existed in a world before UHD/4K, and expected all media to be transcoded to ProRes prior to editing, and so it ask you if you wanted to make your sequence match your source since your source typically matched your expected delivery format. You can easily override this when it asks you.   Even stranger, my camera has been shooting at 24 frames per second but then when I put it into my computer and onto FCP, it tells me my footage has been shot with 30fps! Is it reading it wrong?    I can't tell if it's reading your footage wrong because I can't see if you actually shot in 24p or not, or if you're looking at Sequence Settings, or whatever. There are too many variables for me to begin to guess here, but if you whack one of the files with MediaInfo it should tell us a lot more information.   I'm using a Canon 60D for shooting and just the really basic and old school Final Cut Pro HD for editing.    There's a couple of things that really stand out to me based on this sentence. First, you're using a 60D, which is a great camera, but it shoots H.264, and you're using Final Cut Pro HD. I hope that's merely an error on your part, because Apple branded version 4.5 as ""HD"" and that version is eleven years old now. Final Cut never really liked working with any format that wasn't DV or ProRes, so if you're editing your footage directly out of your camera that's going to inevitably result in some kind of weirdness. I'd strongly recommend, if you aren't going to update your software, to at least transcode your footage to ProRes prior to editing.   Any help from people who have some sort of clue about what they're doing would be greatly appreciated!   It would be helpful if we had a clue about why you're going to anamorphic. What are you delivering to? What format are you going to master in? Once we know these things we may be able to figure out an efficient way of getting you where you need to be."

I can tell you that the shows that aren't avid are usually not worth the hassle. It shows that the production is cheap and doesn't take post seriously. The non avid gigs also pay less and are usually the lower quality all around.  The only exception is documentaries."
editors,3b8p45,icancut,-1,Sat Jun 27 15:32:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah that Focus film cut on FCPX costing 60 million was cheap ditto for that Fincher film cut in Premier. Things are changing slowly...  Those high end jobs are rare and out of reach for probably 99% of us. We take those other jobs to keep the lights on and prove we can handle those bigger jobs IF we ever get the chance to do them. Not to be cruel, but there people waiting on guys like Walter Murch to die so an opportunity opens up for us because those opportunities are so rare and hard to get."
editors,3b8p45,elriggo44,2,Sat Jun 27 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"There are exceptions to every rule. Murch cut Cold Mountain in FCP.   Also, the editor on a 60 million dollar feature picks the system. If the editor likes premiere better he will use it.   People have been saying ""things are changing slowly"" for 20 years. It's just not the reality in Los Angeles.   If you only know premiere out here you are going to be hard up and you will not work full time, year round as a freelancer. And be prepared to work on tons of crap reality shows and that's about it. Unless of course, you link up with that one editor who wants to cut a big feature in premier.   You sure as hell won't work on any scripted TV. Because those editors don't want to work on Premier. It's not at a place yet where sharing multiple projects works easily enough. And they already know Avid.   Personally, I use premier for home use and for smaller stuff. But I would never think of trying to use it on one of my tv shows.  The pool of professional scripted TV editors who know how to use Avid is much higher than the pool of professional scripted premier editors. And any show is going to want to have the largest available pool of talent.   UCP recently purchased enough systems for every single show they produce. What do you think they bought? The bought Avid. So, if you want to work for Universal you have to know avid.   I don't know why you went off on how you are waiting for older editors to die. It's weird. You could just wait for them to retire."
editors,3b8p45,icancut,0,Sat Jun 27 19:26:27 2015 UTC,"People have been saying ""things are changing slowly"" for 20 years. It's just not the reality in Los Angeles.    And things haven't changed? 20 years ago me in my little BFE hometown had never heard of Avid. Editing a feature on a home computer was not realistic at all unless you had $$$. Is LA not basically an island unto itself? I mean if it's resisting change and everywhere else is changing, doesn't that mean LA is becoming the shrinking dinosaur? The next group of ""insert famous director of your choice here"" is going to come up from the internet and they're not going to give a crap how it was done before because their way was how they became successful. That's how it's seemingly been going on for generations. If they can be successful without Hollywood, why would they adapt to what Hollywood wants?  The ""die"" thing is just about opportunities opening up. Walter is how old and still able to edit? I fully hope to be editing until I'm either blind beyond belief or they're going to have to pry a keyboard from my cold dead hands. I think with the way techs changing you can probably be an editor til you want to quit...and jobs, especially high paying ones, for older people, are not exactly easy to come by and I know if it was mine, I wouldn't give it up and I doubt most people on that level are going to roll over and relax when the time comes...especially if they can keep clocking 6 figure paychecks for it. Hence, they gotta die because retirement is not something you really have to do with this skill now thanks to technology.   Please don't think I want Walter or any of those guys to die....my point is there are few of those jobs and those who have them seem very unlikely to just give them up."
editors,3b8p45,soundman1024,3,Sat Jun 27 19:44:39 2015 UTC,"I'm going to guess Avid has owned the market for as long as you've been alive. They offer turnkey systems others can't touch, and that's why they remain dominant.  LA isn't an island or a dinosaur, it's a thriving market where shit gets done. Avid allows multiuser workflows that other NLEs can't touch. FCP was getting there, then X dropped with zero multi-user workflow options. The reason you hear so little about Avid is because when it's needed it's needed. It isn't really a discussion to be had.  Things change slowly because Avid is a capital expense. It's purchased with storage (tens, hundreds, or thousands of terabytes of fiber connected storage), media asset management, I/O hardware, support licenses—it's purchased as a turnkey system. And with a single support contract there's a single throat to choke. If something isn't working you call Avid. Doesn't matter what the problem is, Avid is the call to make.  If I'm an Avid based shop with 20 seats and I want to go to Premiere I have to find a Premiere or FCX workflow that allows multiple users to work in the same project without having versioning problems. Additionally I have to find a storage vendor and a media asset management vendor and have support contracts with them. Support contracts are key. Time offline is money lost. I no longer have one throat to choke. A problem might involve getting two companies to work together for a solution. The only company that can touch Avid is Grass Valley with a K2/Edius/Stratus install. It's very live-production, broadcast news focused. Finally to migrate I have to be able to deal with lower productivity while editors are learning a new NLE. It isn't going to be without speed bumps.  It isn't that things don't change. Things do change. When it makes business sense for them to change. When it's profitable to change. When there are tangible benefits to changing.  I'm a Premiere editor. We do a lot of motion graphics at our shop in C4D/AE. It makes business sense for us to stay inside Adobe's world. So we made that jump. If Adobe Anywhere matures into a local multiuser workflow instead of a cloud workflow it might begin challenging Avid for multiuser, but it still needs 3rd party storage and MAM."

In The Blink of an Eye by Walter Murch is pretty much everyone's go to opus for learning about what you're aiming at, it's a good read and pretty riveting, but it can also be a bit overwhelming so don't think you'll grasp it completely the first time through.  As far as being a pro: that's a nebulous concept. Work on being authentic and being comfortable with the software and footage. You develop your skill set then you learn how to employ that skill set to tell stories the way that you want. It sounds easy but it's not. You will never achieve a plateau, you will always be getting better, you will always hate your previous work, you will always want to improve.

Master Avid & Premiere and have at least a good working knowledge of FCP for the older-school studios out there. Being able to use all major NLEs well will give you the ability to work in any kind of studio, and looks great on a resume.

The Carpenters' skill is not 100% dependent upon his tools. Learn all the tools, but especially the wetware skills that every other joe with a few grand of software and hardware doesn't have.  Spend time not only focusing on the modern tools, but good practices in an edit suite. Probably hard to do on your own, but they will develop over time the more work you do. Think about this, twenty years ago the tools were completely different. Twenty years from now they will have changed even more. Your skill needs to translate from todays tools into tomorrows.  Organization is very important. Both mentally and in the computer. Learn how to organize your projects so you can find everything without wasting time. Think of a documentary with hundreds and hundreds of reels. Or a commercial edit with forty takes of someone picking up a cup. That is what you are up against. How do you mentally know what is what or where it is.  A big problem I see with both novices and pros alike is disorganization. Its one thing to hunt and peck for an alternate take or to figure out some shitty effect when you are alone working blissfully... but when you have clients, and then the client's clients sitting behind you waiting for results you have to be able to make things happen.  Working on stuff that has been pre-cut is a good start and we've all done that. But you have to get your hands on raw footage from someone somehow and practice practice practice."

Are they simply a bit out-of-date and will soon be high-end Core-i7s?  Or does Xeon offer something particularly good for video editing?
editors,3b6p52,fanamana,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:16:40 2015 UTC,"Xeons offer Intel's best chips by inspection, and are sold to the business class market at a premium.  They are typically the same architecture as the desktop class chips, but offering different configurations like more cache, more cores at lower speeds\lower temps\lower wattage(server farm cpu), more cores at performance speeds, multi-cpu compatibility, special instruction sets switched on, etc.  The idea is they cost more because they are less likely to die on you, and they configured for industrial use.  The same is true of Nvidia gtx vs quadro, AMD Radeon vs FirePro.  The thing is, there's little performance difference from high end desktop i7s and xeons for the most part, and GTX are much better deals for CUDA cores per/$.  Neither i7s or GTX cards should end up dying on you, but in the rare event they do, you've already saved enough to replace it(if warranty doesn't cover) and still be ahead."

Especially when someone is being such an asshole to you    It all depends on whether your show is union or not and what contract you are on.   It ranges from an ""extremely low budget single production"" (under 1.6 million total budget) where you will make at least $1238.33 a week (10 hour guarantee a day)   All the way to ""post production New York majors"" where you can make a minimum of  $1628.80  The first assist makes much more in features. But based on your status as relatively new to anything but reality I'd say you will be closer to the minimum.   In LA a TV assistant makes over $2000 a week (minimum) on a union show. So honestly the range is pretty big.   Don't take any less than you make in reality because that's a slap in the face. And join the union if it's a union show. Otherwise you won't get the gig."

It won't simply skip the save without raising an error box. For me at least, that is worse than waiting through the save."
editors,3b2xc7,cy_sperling,2,Thu Jun 25 17:51:07 2015 UTC,I'd take that old problem in a heartbeat. Some of these bins take 3-5 mins a piece to save. If you have open 4 then by the time they're done saving your at the next prompted auto-save.... brutal
editors,3b2xc7,cy_sperling,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:40:19 2015 UTC,Something is pretty wrong if it is taking that long to save. How many cuts do you have in those bins? Can you archive all your old cuts so that the bins you need to reference only contain one?

That would be a very small bin to work out of. You could then do a quick conform of the reused material once you lock picture.

editors,3b1kep,LetItRide_DemonDays,17,Thu Jun 25 05:47:34 2015 UTC,"I've edited many animated shows: Arthur, Postcards From Buster, Peep And the Big Wide World, Fugget About it, to name a few...  It's very different.  80% of your time is editing ""leicas"" or ""animatics"" as they are sometimes called.  These are basically animated flip books, sketches of what the final animation will look like.  It's common for a half hour show to contain about 3,000 still images in leica format.  Then, every frame is obsessed over, redrawn, redone, multiple times.  The hardest part for the editor is keeping track of all the changes, and have multiple versions ready to compare at a press of a keystroke.    On the bright side: animation editors tend to make amazing editors down the road, because they develop military-precision over cuts, versioning, and integrating yourself as part of a team.  Live action footage just doesn't come close to the frame-accuracy that is demanded of animation.  On the downside: if you aren't tech-savvy, you really won't make it in the animation world.  Likewise, if you cannot develop unique workflows with the storyboard and animation departments, you're going to end up working 16 hour days just to get all your work done.    If just having a full-time job is priority, then animation editing will never leave you without it.  Children's productions never go out of style and the workload never ceases.  You could quite easily make a lifetime career from it.  It pays less than most live action, unfortunately, but a steady 55-65k/year salary should be achievable."

Make sure you know exactly what they need. If they will be wanting anything flashy for an opening or if they will want you to do notes, or anything extra, those hours need to be accounted for.

I'm not in front of my FCP7 machine, but it should be in the sequence settings under audio and you may need to make a custom setup for it.  Then on each track in the timeline you need to set the channel output for the track and put the correct file to each one. Right click each track icon so that they are aligned as follows:    Track Output Audio File    A1 Channel 1 L   A2 Channel 2 R   A3 Channel 3 C   A4 Channel 4 LFE   A5 Channel 5 Ls   A6 Channel 6 Rs   A7 Channel 7+8 Stereo Left   A8 Channel 7+8 Stereo Right    When you export at sequence settings it will keep this alignment but if you use quicktime conversion export im not sure it will hold up since the preset outputs are different."

You need to make sure your Sequence Settings are configured for Discrete output (not Stereo Mix) and under the last tab (the one for audio; I forget its name) you want to make sure channels 1-6 are set for ""Dual Mono"" with a +0dB adjustment. Then 7+8 should be Stereo.  Make sure your individual sequence tracks are then mapped to the right channels (right click in the patch field to make sure 1 is mapped to 1, 2 to 2, and so forth)."

editors,3atyou,humeanation,5,Tue Jun 23 14:15:55 2015 UTC,"The phenomena you're asking about is called Generation Loss. ProRes 422 HQ and H.264 are both lossy compression formats (H.264 has a lossless mode, but that's rarely used; Apple describes ProRes as ""virtually lossless"") and whenever you are going to a lossy format you will experience generation loss. The big question, though, is how much loss will you experience, and that's what you can control to within a reasonable amount (ProRes 422 HQ → ProRes 422 HQ is generally considered to be nominally lossless). There is an older blog post about the amount of generation loss across different formats and encoders here. Note that it's almost two and a half years out of date, and the ffmpeg project has come a long ways since then.  That's the bad news. The good news is that, IIRC, depending on the individual tool you're using and how you use it, if you're going from ProRes 422 HQ to ProRes 422 HQ, and we're talking cuts-only editing (no effects or anything) then your NLE may pass it through untouched, directly copying over the parts of the bitstream it needs, passing it through losslessly."

editors,3atyou,Kichigai,2,Tue Jun 23 15:22:56 2015 UTC,"Damn! I was hoping this wasn't the case.   Don't get so hung up over it. ProRes is pretty resilient and tolerates transcoding pretty well.

Just a simple cut (actually at the end of the sequence). Then exporting.  Using FCP X or Adobe Premiere CC. Whichever is best for that really?   I have no experience with FCPX, but I'd wager the two are probably neck and neck. IF you use Smart Rendering in Premiere you should be fine. I'd wager FCPX does this too, but I have no idea about how it's implemented.  Alternatively, just open it up in Quicktime (or MPEG Streamclip), put it in Trim mode, slice the end off, do a Save As.

Surely AMD handles OpenCL better then Nvidia? Or do they both work equally as well with OpenCL?

Also, the multigroup clip needs to be cut in on V1 on the sequence in order for the angles to display. If it's not on V1, you won't be able to view the other angles.

Does this replace DNxHD or are they for different resolutions? Can you be a little more specific by what you mean when you say 'mixed format wise talking'?"
editors,3ap87i,drnaud,3,Mon Jun 22 16:50:53 2015 UTC,"Log-c is effectively a color Space. Depending of the workflow of the project and post house you work for, you might have to apply look-up tables (or LUT) to the footage. This is done through the ""Source settings..."" option of the clip menu.  DNxHR was created by Avid to support UltraHD Projects. It's a complete new way of managing your resolutions. It keeps the source resolution and frame rate upon transcode without having to switch your project settings. So when you have, for example, a documentary shot in 1080p@23,976 with archive footage in SD@29,97, both footage stay in their native resolution and frame rate, giving more latitude upon playing with effects, resizing, tiemwarps etc."

Adobe are pushing the enterprise-level editing and collaboration solution Abobe Anywhere, competing with the platform Interplay Sphere, rebadged Avid Everywhere.

editors,3ap87i,Kichigai,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:01:58 2015 UTC,"H.265 eh? I was honestly wondering if it would actually take off.   Well, it was either H.265 or VP9. Just no way to wring enough efficiency out of H.264 to reasonably deliver UHD+ media.   I look forward to the head aches that's going to cause :)   We're already seeing some teething problems. For example, Sony delivered a UHD SmartTV a few years back (one of the first on the market) and then Netflix announced they were going to do H.265 delivery for UHD. So Sony had to slap together a decoder box and start selling it off to people.  And ATSC 3.0 has been pushed back a bit as they're rekajiggering the spec to allow for the use of H.265 media as well, with 2160p59.94 capability I have to wonder if they're going to bother to include stereoscopic specs too).  But for the most part it's not going to be that bad. It's like when people went from MPEG-2 to H.264. It's an evolutionary step. Aside from greater CPU demand for decoding, and learning all the new jargon it's going to be an engineer's issue for the most part."

editors,3ap87i,Kichigai,2,Mon Jun 22 23:46:39 2015 UTC,"The interface for Media Composer hasn't changed much since 5.5 I'd say (except maybe a little more color; yippee!).  As far as the PC/Mac thing, once you get into Media Composer it's basically the same. Just wherever you remember pressing Command for a short cut you should be swapping in Control. Similar story when manipulating clips in a bin: you Control+Click to select multiple ones, while Shift+Click is what you use to select a range. Also you will have to Right Click. I'm pretty sure Control+Click, even in Media Composer, will not bring up the menu.  Media Composer also lives within one enormous window, as opposed to being a ton of floating independent windows. This gets to be a real pain in the ass if you have screens of differing resolutions as it won't want to make the window bigger than the smallest screen. You'll also have to drag over the window to the second screen in order to utilize it.  The other thing to note is that AMA Linking between OS X and Windows is kind of rocky. This is because OS X file paths are very different from Windows file paths, so if you're working with any AMA Media you'll need to be relinking every time you move from one machine to the other (it might be worth having separate bins of AMA media to that extent). Ingested media, however, is 100% painless.  Otherwise it's pretty seamless. We've got an old MacPro2,1 that I've jury-rigged to run Windows 8.1/64-bit and it's living in a world that is otherwise 100% OS X. It pops into and out of projects without any fuss, aside from AMA Linking."

Get production experience, be diligent, work hard and show that you can be relied upon for your hard work.  When it does come to editing your reel KEEP IT SHORT. Don't repeat stuff. Keep it as short as possible then probably cut it in half. If it's a series of clips 5 minutes MAX, but even that sounds long."
editors,3ap87i,jacon_bacon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:15:50 2015 UTC,"I had to make a reel as my last assignment before graduating. Do something creative with it yes, but since your an editor make sure you show scenes from stuff you've edited!  A lot of people like to make montage reels where all we see is fast cuts paced to music. Unless that's something you've actually cut like a music video then it's pretty useless to do that.  When I did mine I took 4 different scenes from different films I had done over college. It shows the potential employer that you know how to cut scenes together and not just place pretty shots over music. But if you have time I'd also make a few reels to pass around. You could have one for comedy, one for drama, and if you really want make a montage one. Personally I have a VFX reel and a drama reel.   Also, unless you're applying to a really small and no budget production house you're not going to be Editing. You will most likely start as an intern or an assistant in which case you just need to know the NLE they are using. The rest will go from there. Hope it helps, good luck!"

editors,3ap87i,LetsBeFlashy,2,Mon Jun 22 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"Slip: You use slip to change what parts of a clip you see.  You're keeping the length of the clip on the timeline exactly the same. But Slip allow you to change the In and Out points at the same time, ""Slipping"" the footage inside of the length on the timeline.  Slide: You use slide to literally slide a clip (or clips) on the timeline, a little earlier/later.  The slide tool will automatically shorten/lengthen the clips surrounding the clip you want to slide.  Helpful hint: Look at the cursor with each tool when you're on a clip.  With slip, the edits are on the inside - the inside clip is changing content.  With Slide, the edits are on the outside - the outside clips are changing."

I'm very patient with someone who is writing things down, but I'm not as patient for the 2nd time answering things. Or the 3rd. Or the 5th. Even if you think you know the software and won't have questions you don't know all the volumes and folders where things are stored. Every post house has their own setup and while there's method to the madness it's a lot to remember.  On the subject of questions, I expect a lot of them early on. If you aren't asking enough questions you'll be redoing a lot of work. When you run into a question see if you can continue working and ask a few questions at once instead of interrupting for one question often.  Finally, it's very important to remember that internships should be an exchange. They need to get some things done, but you need to be learning. Take charge of some of your learning. Ask if you can take on some projects that sound fun or ask if someone can break down an project and explain how it works. If you aren't learning you need to figure out if it's because they're looking for free labor or if it's because you aren't asking questions. If they're just looking for free labor consider ending the internship early."

If you can't find a job with a proper firm, like /u/agent42b and /u/goldenrobotdick suggested, I'd say a good fallback is to consider looking at Public Access cable, if you're in the US. You pay a nominal membership fee, take a couple classes, and then you're qualified to work on most of their programming. Start volunteering with an existing show and see what you can learn from that.  It's not the best thing in the world, but at least it gets you some experience, which is better than none.

It seems to respect that. For now. Maybe.

editors,3akwuk,AAARRGHH,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:45:00 2015 UTC,"If memory serves the way they do it over at TWiT (they record their shows live) is that each caller is run out on a separate machine that handles just their call, and that's fed into a video switcher and it's manipulated there. They used to have this huge multi-monitor display for showing callers in-studio that they called Skypeasaurus. Leo Laporte has a whole huge rundown of their setup here. I'm not sure how they get rid of the call overlays, though. It might be a unidirectional video feed.  For the most part, though, I'd say just go with /u/slippy_fist's suggestion. It's simple, easy, and will yield the best quality results (no quality drop-outs due to network congestion or whatnot).  If you're still going to try and do this stuff live I really recommend not using Skype. Skype uses peer-to-peer networking as a key part of their network, so when you're running Skype you're not just handling your call, but you're handling the calls of other Skype users as well, which can impact system performance for you.  Non-P2P alternatives would include Apple's FaceTime, Google Hangouts (which you can record to YouTube), Viber, and ooVoo, and among others that I'm sure are out there. There are also solutions that use the SIP protocol, which means they're interoperable with each other, like LinPhone, Jitsi, and a kajillion others. If you decide to go with the record-the-video-and-then-send-it solution, as /u/slippy_fist suggested, I might look into using a Mumble server for your voice chat. Murmur (the Mumble server) is a piece of cake to set up and it uses very little bandwidth with practically no performance impact."

editors,3aka33,GeorgePantsMcG,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:39:10 2015 UTC,"I have a 3840x2160 video from my Samsung Galaxy S6. […] I'm also confused about the video's 29.68 fps frame rate... that's kind of odd. Necessary?   Big no-no. Most Android phones (including the S6 it would seem) shoot using variable frame rate, which most NLEs don't play nice with. Premiere, especially older versions, do not cope well with that kind of media, and if you're working with it natively you could see issues like desynchronization of the audio, erratic playback, slipping and sliding of your edits, and inconsistent edit lengths. I strongly recommend converting this to a constant frame rate file before working with it. ffmpeg can handle this pretty easily.  ffmpeg -i (input file) -c:v prores_ks -profile:v 1 -c:a pcm_s16le -r 30000/1001 (output file).mov   That should produce a ProRes 422 LT file with a constant frame rate of 29.97 and PCM audio. The resulting file will be large, though, but Premiere will like it.   Edit: I eventually changed the H.264 profile to ""High"" and messed with other settings I wasn't very sure about. Then, it let me increase the resolution.   What probably did it for you was the level. That dictates the amount of data that can be used in a given video stream, and if it's too low then it'll constrain your bitrate and resolution. For UHD/2160p/4K media we're typically talking Level 4.2."

To me there is a big difference between covering an interview with a cutaway, showing a jump-cut, and morphing to hide it.       I'm not saying I don't use morphs to hide edits, I have and will, I'm just curious if other people consider the intent.   To me a morph is essentially creating a fictional account of what someone said – the viewer sees them say something they actually did not say continuously.    I always feel like I should be extra careful when I'm using a morph -- is it true to what the person said?  Would they feel cheated by the edit?   Would a viewer seeing the unedited interview feel I used something out of context?"

You haven't leaned over to your producer and said ""Hey, does that person have a release"" in an edit session? Not only are questions like that appreciated down the line, but could end up saving you/production company time going back and editing someone out or worse -- getting sued outright by that person after delivery. Obviously this is the job of someone else but it never hurts to be on it. Moving foward to your actual question, it's just weird.

editors,3ajkeg,Uncouth-Villager,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"Were talking about different situations obviously. A talking head interview set up sure, it goes without saying there is a release. Have you worked in reality television at all? Event coverage? My statements probably belong in that realm of post production and, if you've worked in that vein, you'll know what I'm talking about. Anyway - if your original question from your original post is based on morals for you personally as an editor - Why are you worried about a viewer seeing the un-edited interview you cut? Are you making that raw footage available to the general public to see? if not, why even ask that question? Are you being forced to edit people to say "" I kill people, its fun"" when they originally said "" I love puppies and daisies""? If its not to that extreme, I don't find the relevancy in your question at all, or better yet, how to even respond to it....Clearly."
editors,3ajkeg,d1squiet,2,Mon Jun 22 18:34:36 2015 UTC,"Well it's never that extreme, that would be literally lying.  What I was getting at was that when I do a morph it feels more ""fictionalizing"" than when I cover an edit or do a jump cut.     It's similar to reading an article that says:    Joe Smith says, ""I hate Obama, he's a terrible president.""   vs  Joe Smith says, ""I hate Obama... he's a terrible president.""     The difference is subtle perhaps, but there is an honesty question. Version 1 claims to be quoting Joe Smith directly while version 2 (with the ellipsis )  is clear that it is editing something out.  It could just be an aside, or it could be something that changes your view of Joe Smith, but knowing that something has been cut out clues you into the fact that you are not reading exactly what Joe Smith said.     A morph obscures the ability of the viewer to know when edits could have been made.  I have used them , and will continue to – I'm not an absolutist.  But I definitely feel more care must be given to the place/reason for a morph than other ways of editing interviews."
editors,3ajkeg,Uncouth-Villager,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:55:22 2015 UTC,"I appreciate you trying to detail your subjective idea about the fictitious nature of morph-cut. What is important to understand is; for the most part your end-viewer isn't going to be thinking about when edits could have been made, nor thinking about whether their ability to do just that has been obscured by an effect (if implemented cleanly and not over effectually). The only people who I feel your idea might apply to is: Other editors, the client & the talent on the day? There are far more important things to be over-thinking about ;)"

Jump-cuts are clear markers that something has been edited out (""Mr. Death"" jumps to mind, by errol morris) and even B-roll over edits, or cutaways, is a giveaway that perhaps this is an interpretation.  But the morph of an interview creates a new reality – where there is a continuous piece of video showing the person saying something they did not say.     Again, I'm not saying ""never use morphs"" or anything like that.  I'm just pointing out that, for me at least, they feel quite different from straight cuts and dissolves.   I guess because they are not using ""misdirection"" to hide edits, they are essentially just a visual effect."

Now, if there were an audio transition that were so smart that it could predict and alter their sentence flow (in terms of prosody a.k.a. ""intonation""), then you'd be able to actually hide cuts with it like you're talking about - that, and a version of Morph Cut that always worked.  For now, I don't think it's quite to that level."

Generally speaking, it doesn't work very often (that is, it throws an error much, maybe most, of the time), and it's obviously not perfect.  Sometimes, you can get pretty goods results out of it, but my biggest gripe is that it takes FOREVER to analyze!  You have to sit there and wait for it for about a minute sometimes, and you have to wait, because it fails so frequently that you don't dare go onto something else, expecting to just come back to it and check on it later.  So, I think it's a handy tool which can sometimes be helpful, but I don't think I'll use it very much, and you definitely can't count on it to save you.  Sometimes the image of the face is clear as day, and it reports ""cannot find face"", and then you're just sunk."

editors,3aengn,FuzeDzn,2,Sat Jun 20 18:29:26 2015 UTC,"We're doing an internal piece right now, and for that piece I was asked to call up some old interviews we did. For the most part almost all of it was footage I had handled originally, and a lot of it was still sitting in the SAN. Recovery and ingest was a cakewalk, and for a time I thought this post was going to be about some C300 footage that mysteriously changed its timecode, but I wasn't finished. The last bit (and the majority of the footage) predates me, going back to stuff we did for for a certain show about a certain island with certain initiatives. This went back to the online/offline days for us, which meant tape.  Now as luck would have it, I easily found the bins for the 1080p D5s (originally I thought I'd only find the 480i bins) and transcripts for these interviews, and for once everything was properly archived in a project box. Piece of cake, right? Mostly. For once my pet peeve about tapes not being rewound wasn't what came up, and only half the tapes weren't write protected. However out of a series of eleven tapes only one actually had anything written on it. The rest were wholly unlabeled. So now I have a new side project.  Looking at the tapes it was also pretty obvious from the slates that they had originated from Final Cut Pro. My best guess is that the interviews started life as DVCPro HD or XDCAM EX and were ingested in FCP, then spat out to D5 for some reason. Whoever did this thought they were really clever by splitting up some of the interviews into parts, so the last chunk of a given interview ended up on a different tape (sometimes not even the next consecutive tape). Obvious reasoning here was that it would economize tape consumption, but I'd bet that if they had just used 63 minute cassettes across the board, instead of some 63s and some 33s, this wouldn't have been necessary.  The problem is that after getting transcripts with the producer's notes on it, and after I ran the transcripts through ScriptSync™, I realized we were missing the last two thirds of one of the interviews. After shutting through fourteen tapes it became obvious that this wasn't just a logging error in the bins I had retrieved. Since this project predated our current library system this meant it had no project code, and none of my keyword searches were getting me anywhere.  Now the bright side to this story: since this was an internal project it meant that it was low priority, and since the producer running the show was actively working on potentially more lucrative projects it meant there wasn't a lot of time pressure. So when I replied to her email to inform her of the situation and that it would take time for me to dig through stuff, I got a reply from the advising producer she had CC'd that he remembers the footage had gone missing during the original project and not to worry about it as the footage in question was officially considered to be as the Oceanic 815."

I do use the term with A/B cams on a subject, however the goal of rough cutting the monologue for content(bites, blurbs, statements, etc) is the same regardless of the number of camera angles.  Before adding b-roll, we refer to rough cutting talking heads as building the radio cut. While there isn't an actual goal of delivering an audio only version, the idea behind building the radio cut is emphasizing  the audio content first and foremost, constructing a narrative foundation.  Once that's achieved, and we start adding b-roll or  cutting between A/B camera angles, we just call the sequence a Rough Cut.  I found the video instructive, but not super groundbreaking or anything.  I'm still not sure exactly what he meant when using the term sync.  Like it was the pace of his cut or something."

Only when I do the final j/l cuts on audio I call it a final cut. It depends on the project mostly. For example, on Big Brother final cuts were extremely sloppy rough cuts, but they were final for storyline (through their awful proprietary editing software you could put cuts on each second or so and it got shuttled to avids for finishing, awful system)."

It is a good solution (a.k.a. the one we always use) when you have a dozen of clips or so, because renaming the sequences doesn't take too long. In fact, we usually create one sequence with the TC effect on V2, and then create a subsequence for each clip. Takes seconds with the good shortcuts mapped to the keyboard. You can even program a Macro with some gamer-keyboards (wich is pretty cool!). We then rename the subsequences to the clip they contain.  Anyway, renaming a hundred subsequences can be kind of a PITA. That's why a was looking for an ""automated"" way.  But thanks for the input! Can be useful to somebody who doesn't know the trick!"

When the export dialogue comes up, it'll just have you select the export settings for the first clip in the bin, but it will export every clip you have selected. This will leave you with a bunch of clips with the correct name, but no BITC. However, it should have the same source timecode, so you could then take those in Media Encoder or Compressor or anything else you have that can add a BITC to the file. You're going to have 2 generations of loss, but if it's just for the directors and producer to screen online I think that should be OK."

editors,3ae287,whatarereddits,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:23:41 2015 UTC,"I used a couple of very gnarly formulas as I never figured out how to do it in one step. So I first converted TC to number of frames. Note this is for 24fps tc. and not at all accurate for dropframe/non drop frame. But I assume you could change all the 24s to 30s and maybe it will still work for 30fps?  first, an image of what my excel looks like.  So the C column has the formula to convert TC to frames:  =(VALUE(RIGHT(B2,2)))+VALUE(LEFT(RIGHT(B2,5),2))*24+VALUE(LEFT(RIGHT(B2,8),2)*24*60)  Then I summed all of the frames at the bottom of column C.  To convert frames into timecode, you can use this barrel of fun times, which is at the bottom of the B column:  =CONCATENATE(TEXT(QUOTIENT(C20,(60*24*60)),""00""),"":"", TEXT(QUOTIENT(MOD(C20,60*60*24),(60*24)),""00""),"":"", TEXT(QUOTIENT(MOD(C20,60*24),24),""00""),"":"", TEXT(MOD(C20,24),""00""))  It may be the only time since middle school that I've needed to use modulus.

I'd also raise some concern over the I/O options on that sucker. While it has Firewire, it's a 4-pin 1394a port (AKA: Firewire 400), and it lacks any USB 3.0 ports. So in terms of high speed access to external hard disks it's well behind a MacBook Pro of similar age.  Now, having followed your link, I can see why you're looking at this machine. It might look like a good idea, as it's $249 down from $1,699, but there's a reason it's down that far. The $1,699 price is the MSRP when it was new, and that was three years ago. So you're not really getting much of a deal on that sucker. Especially when you consider that you can get it from NewEgg or TigerDirect for the exact same price, but they don't have a ticking clock.  Compared to a similar vintage MacBook Pro, that sucker is toast. Partly that's because that's one of HP's cheaper workstation laptops.

editors,3abr76,Mantis_Tobboggan,3,Thu Jun 18 20:30:54 2015 UTC,"Kick yourself now and you'll probably just have to eat it on this project as you already came to terms on a price. If they bring you more projects, adjust your rates accordingly. $200 per edit, even if simple editing, is cheap. 3-5 hours worth of footage to import, edit, color correct, encode, transcode, author, yadda yadda yadda, can eat up a lot of time. Stop valuing your time so low. Have confidence in yourself and your abilities. ALWAYS reasonably over shoot your pricing. Worst that happens is they say no and you can come down a bit with negotiations, thus making the client think they're getting a deal or better pricing when in fact you're just getting what you'd settle for as ok money. If they agree to the over shot price, then you've just made extra coin. It's difficult starting out to tell someone what you charge. Most people don't understand the time and resources that go into editing, so some don't know how to equate wages comparatively to a standard 9-5 desk job and might think $200-500/video is outrageous."

Tell him that you wanted the work and you're undercharging him. See if he's happen with the first couple.  Ask him what he thought he was going to pay.  See if he's willing to bump it up.

editors,3a91o1,greenysmac,2,Thu Jun 18 17:04:49 2015 UTC,"Raw looks horrible, because it's raw sensor data.  You need a LUT - Look up table - for it to look 'normal' on the computer. This is a good thing - it allows you to recover more light than the sensor has.  It doesn't sound like you really know much of what you're doing in Premiere or Resolve - which is fine; this is how we learn. You might want to work with someone else who has one of these cameras first, to learn the workflow.  RAW is nearly impossible to use at 4k because of it's bandwidth; it really requires super fast storage. Not so much at 8 seconds, but it's not really playable.  Here's how to get it into Adobe Premiere Pro 2014 or 2015 (You're SOL if you're using CS6.)  Use the Media Browser (under the window menu) to navigate where the clip is. Seles the clip and import into Adobe Premiere Pro.  Then at this point, all you need to do is apply a LUT."

You need to convert to a workable format such as ProRes, ideally a lower res such as HQ or LT. You can use DaVinci to do this.  I didn't have time to write one but Google is your friend and while old, this will give you a good beginners insight.  https://www.hurlbutvisuals.com/blog/2013/04/blackmagic-camera-post-workflow/  While modern NLE will allow you to cut 4K etc natively, it really is (IMO) bad practice and learning the proper workflows will make everything going forward a lot smoother."

editors,3a30sk,stracted,7,Wed Jun 17 11:28:58 2015 UTC,The black overlay effectively makes for a very odd crop on the photo. You'd never crop at just below the knee and the upper edge of a tree. Photo might have worked if they cut some off the top and had a little more on the bottom.  Additionally the red shirt doesn't say Premiere. After Effects has some smashing geometric artwork that's centered around its deep purple color. I'm a fan of AE's new splash. What's there says After Effects. A person standing on a mountain wearing red doesn't say Premiere.
editors,3a30sk,PinheadX,3,Tue Jun 16 21:24:44 2015 UTC,"I think the image itself doesn't really abstract enough to mesh with the other splash screens. The one for Encoder is ridiculously cool.

This union isn't like the electricians union where you sign the book and wait until you are at the top of the line and you'll be hired. People hire people they know.   I promise I'm not trying to be a dick, I want to clear up any misconceptions because that's how I originally thought the union worked as well.  A lot of people find that they have to join the union as an assist and work their way back up to editor within the union structure.   My advice to anyone looking to join the union is to get the roster and Saftey classes out of the way, do the union intro meeting and then hold off on paying them until you have a gig lined up.   There is no benefit to outright joining the union until you have a job. You will just be stuck paying dues to a union that isn't doing a whole lot for you in your roll as a non union employee."
editors,3a2yej,elriggo44,2,Tue Jun 16 21:35:27 2015 UTC,"I sense no discouragement. Thanks for looking out. I know being in the union doesn't guarantee I'll work on a big show right out of the gate.   My plan was pretty much what you outlined: join the roster, take the class and then stay on said roster until I have a good union gig lined up. Then I'll call and try to get my full union status.   It's a long road, but this producer is making it longer. Thanks for your advice!"
editors,3a2yej,elriggo44,3,Tue Jun 16 22:14:31 2015 UTC,"Tell him you will call the union and put his ass on the radar if he does t do the paperwork.   The union doesn't care about a show or a production company full of people who aren't activly trying to flip a show. There are too many companies like this and the union isn't powerful enough.   One question, did Joe use a Payroll company? If he did you can bypass him and go directly to them.   Also, have you called the union and asked someone there? They are extremely helpful and will do whatever that can to help you out. It's in their best interest to help you join as it will give them another dues paying member.   You may be able to get another producer that worked with you on your Lighthouse projects to write the letter. I  had a co producer write on for me when I couldn't get it from the EP for one show.

Unfortunately, everything was paid out by check, so there's no middle man.   I thought that too. On two of the gigs, I worked mostly with a line producer, not Joe. If the line producer can verify me, does Joe and Lighthouse ever get contacted as a result? CSATF only needs ONE person to verify, right?"
editors,3a2yej,RollX,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:10:14 2015 UTC,"That's my understanding. But if Joe is contacted, so what? CSTAF is not even the union.

editors,3a1s7n,Kichigai,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:27:52 2015 UTC,"Probably, but as I understand it the DNxIO is basically just a BMD UltraStudio 4K Extreme with Avid's name on it, a name whose markup accounts for 25% of the price. So you can get the unbranded version for $3,000, or you could get an AJA Io or KONA for $2,000 (now that I mention it, it feels really weird for AJA to be the ""cheap"" solution).  Thing is if Avid was really desperate to hang onto the hardware business then why would they be supporting Open I/O? I know there are some features still not available in Open I/O, but if they didn't want you to buy cheap boxes then why even support it in the first place? Why not actively sabotage it?  I think this might be Avid's last hurrah with hardware. They're pushing hard to get out of dongles (it's somewhere in the $300-500 range to use one with Media Composer 8+) and this might just be their opportunity to start digging around in the guts of third party hardware to build up Open I/O so they can completely divest themselves of hardware."

It's easier to assemble complicated playlists and whatnot, even though menus are vastly more complicated to assemble.  What I'd do is knock media out of Adobe Media Encoder using the DVD presets that best match your media. Then take that into Encore and tell it to make a new Timeline from Media (select media, New Timeline). Add chapter markers to flavor.  Set timeline as first play, end action to stop, boom. If you need a menu, Adobe has a guide for that.  Now, if you don't need anything crazy or fancy, maybe give DVDStyler a spin.

editors,39z99r,AAARRGHH,2,Tue Jun 16 01:56:00 2015 UTC,May as well group them if you are going to go to the trouble of synching.   If the cameras are jam synched grouping is simple. If they aren't you'll have to do a reality style group.
editors,39z99r,elriggo44,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:03:37 2015 UTC,Can you explain this to me?
editors,39z99r,elriggo44,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:08:30 2015 UTC,Yeah me too. Hehe
editors,39z99r,elriggo44,2,Tue Jun 16 15:58:29 2015 UTC,"The concept of grouping? Or why they should be grouped?  A group is a source monitor loadable set of clips that will all play simultaneously. You can actively switch from camera to camera or you can play up to 9 cameras on the screen at the same time.  They are pretty much standard fare when editing anything that was shot multi-cam.   That way the editor cab load the group in the source and watch all angles at the same time. He/she can do the same once a grouped Clio is cut into a timeline. It also allows for simple switching of the cameras once a clip is cut into the sequence. So you don't have to go back to your synched layout of the multicam footage to switch from one angle to another. The layout sequence is really old school. Most people don't use them. If my assistant were to present those to me as my synched dailies it would make me wonder if he/she knew what they were doing. (I mean no offense, but that would be my first thought. My second thought would be ""I have to teach this kid how to group"" so I'm not a total asshat)  Grouping clips with matching timecode (jammed on set) in the avid is super simple. You don't even need to create a layout sequence. You just select the two (or more) clips that need to be grouped and select ""group clips"" from the ""bin"" (I think) drop down. When it asks you select ""source timecode""  If you are synching multiple clips that  have matching (jammed on set) timecodes throughout (meaning there are multiple A cam clips and multiple B cam clips, and the timecodes for all clips from a specific camera don't overlap) you can chose to ""multi group"". Again select ""source timecode""  The multigroup will create one source clip that contains all of the clips you selected in timecode order. If you sort your bin before creating a multigroup so that the A clips are always above the B clips in the bin your cameras will stay in the same window of your group (this is essential so the editor always knows where each angle is)  Grouping single A and BCam clips without matching TC is pretty simple too. You make a layout and synch the two clips. Match back from the same point in the synched timeline on each clip. Once the matchback is done each master clip should have an in point selected. You can now select each masterclip and run the Group Clips drop down. Instead of using Source Timecode you want to use ""in points""  If you need to make a multigroup of clips that don't have matching TC it's a whole other issue. I will do a copypasta from an old email when I have some time later today. It is a MUCH more involved process."
editors,39z99r,EventTrigger,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:05:11 2015 UTC,Explained very well. Thanks for the detail!
editors,39z99r,EventTrigger,2,Tue Jun 16 17:23:10 2015 UTC,No problem. Check out the Reality Multigroup post I made as well. It will help you out if you ever have to make one.   It's an acquired skill. Takes some practice. But once you have it down it helps a ton.
editors,39z99r,Iseecircles,2,Tue Jun 16 18:43:06 2015 UTC,"This is my copypasta from an old email I used to send to all of my new hires when I was a Lead Assist in reality, this is for multigrouping clips that weren't jammed on set and have no synched timecode:  How to make a (reality style) multigroup (the EASIEST way I know)  Start by opening all Source bins that you plan to group. Create a group work bin for the group you would like to make. Option drag all master clips to your group work bin.   Create a sequence with enough video and audio tracks to accommodatethe number of Cameras you will be grouping. So, if you have 3 Cameras that is 3 video layers and 3-6 audio layers. This will be your ""LAYOUT"" Sequence  Cut in the clip that has the earliest start TC. Now copy that TC to your Sequence. You want to make sure it's the START TIME of your Layout sequence. Beef out your sequence so that it has enough empty space to cut in your LAST clips start TC  Now you have a sequence that you can type a TC number hit enter and go to where you need to cut in your clips.  Load your next clip. Mark in to out on the entire clip. Go to the clips start TC in your sequence and cut it in.  When you are done you should have a sequence with all your clips layed out in a sequence that matches all your clips true START TC's. I label this one as ""Layout""  DUPLICATE THIS SEQUENCE. Call the new one XXXXX Sync  Now SYNC your clips. It is best to leave one set alone and sync to that. EX. only move the B, D, and C cam and not the A. Or, move the A, B and D but not the C. That way you have one stable camera throughout that you can use as a control.   When Synching it is best to use the smart slate if it's available. This manual assumes no smart slate because this is reality, of course they wouldn't use a smart slate.   So, in this case, it's best to use audio and visual checks to be sure it is in Sync. Also to check near the end to be sure nothing has drifted. When a clip is in sync it will almost never sound perfect. Generally the waveforms and audio will look and sound like it's off by 1/8th to 1/2 of a frame.  When you are confident it is fully in sync or as close as it will ever be..   DUPLICATE THIS SEQUENCE. Call the new one XXXXXX ADD EDIT  Go to the head of every clip, and through the video layers only make an add edit.  Now go back to the beginning, and at the head of every clip look at your MASTER TC in your sequence. This is going to be the AUXILIARY TC that you will sync to. In your group work bin carefully type in the AUX TC for all your master clips. Remember, one set of those clips should not have changed so you should be able to just copy paste the Start TC into Aux TC for whichever cam did not move.  NOW you will use the traditional 6 key AE magic trick.  I map them to F 1-6. They are IN THIS ORDER....  1 - Mark Clip 2 - Go to in 3 - Match Frame 4 - Go to out 5 - Mark Out 6 - Subclip  Do this for every clip in the sequence. When you are done you should have subclips for every piece and fragment of video in your sequence WITH the AUX TC attached already to the subclip. (This is why you copy them to the same bin, otherwise you would have to manually type in the AUX TC for EVERY subclip...and who wants top do that? No ONE!)  Now select all your subclips in your bin Highlight your Clip Names in your bin. Apple E will sort them in the bin so that when you create the multigroup the cameras will be in alphabetical order in the window.  When finished CHECK YOUR GROUP. When the multigroup is created if you see anything besides the multigroup and a bunch of group.01's  you have a problem. (If it creates a group.02 or higher, you have a problem. Usually the issue is around the first .02's timecode)   Another great way to verify that a group is right is to take your Sync sequence and cut out all of the blacks. The in/out trt of the group and this new ""Sync_No Black"" Sequence should match exactly because a multi group is a rebuilt version of the sequence that you can play all cameras at the same time.   If you want to verify a third time, Load the multigroup in your source monitor and the sequence in your timeline. Go to the head of the group and the head of your new sequence. Gang them and make sure they match.   Play the group, make sure it is still in sync.  Have a beer. You just made a multigroup!"

editors,39xoer,greenysmac,2,Tue Jun 16 04:36:26 2015 UTC,"The rule is generally this:   if you are importing music as genuine stereo tracks, and are editing with stereo tracks, then setting up the audio project as ""mono"" will work fine.  This is because all other non-music sources are usually mono and this will work out. if you are importing music as dual mono (L/R), then set up your project as ""L/R"" otherwise your music will sound messed up (both channels will be center panned).     Most facilities I have worked at have a hard-rule that your project MUST be set to L/R.  Keep in mind that this setting is only PER PROJECT.  If an editor has their project set to mono, but you have your project set to ""L/R"" and open their sequence ... then all of his original center panned stuff will suddenly be L/R for you... so it's important for everyone to be really consistent.     One thing you can do on every computer used for editing: make a new project and change the audio project setting to whatever you decided (mono or L/R).  Then go to the SPECIAL menu and SITE SETTINGS.  Drag-and-drop your ""audio project"" setting into the site setting window.  Essentially any settings dragged into the ""site settings"" category means that it will be universally treated as such, no matter what project.

I wish more Mac users would use their free NTFS plugin and stop forcing us to buy MacDrive...   It's not a plugin, it's a kernel extension included with the OS. Just plug in the disk and it works. Problem is you need to have a second disk laying around if you want to do anything. Oops, file needs to be rewrapped! Better find some space elsewhere. And God help you if the disk gets corrupt.

editors,39y9jj,Nicklaus_OBrien,2,Mon Jun 15 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool, but more like a graphic than an actual edit?  There weren't any cuts or much imagery to really critique on so maybe you're looking for more VFX critiques than editing critiques? Also for some reason the link is set to start 12 sec in. Anyway, here are my two cents on the concept:  I think the concept is nice, straightforward and simple, and if done correctly a good tease can be powerful in it's minimalism. Good job in that respect! If you can, I think it'd be cool to actually see some of those clips in there individually first before totally revealing the larger effect. So you could still have your full multi-cam effect, instead we start by seeing one quick action clip at full frame. The way you have your audio could still work too. Then do a pan move to another frame within the multi-cam to another action clip which then goes full screen and maybe a third if the timing works. Just enough time on each individual clip to see the  ""big moment"" Then you can go into your big zoom out/reveal.  Personally I think that would read a little better as ""individual stories within a larger frame"" kinda concept that I think you are going for.   This all coming from someone who has no idea what the actual start up will do. Good luck though!"
editors,39y9jj,Tripp-Lite,2,Mon Jun 15 21:24:28 2015 UTC,"Firstly, agreed that this probably belongs more in r/aftereffects than here. But that said, I really like the concept.   Usually it's very obvious when I see the text/logo overlay and that always bothers me. I always want it to be as if it's a puzzle piece coming together forming the message rather than seeing a simple fade in and faking this mosaic reveal. This isn't as obvious but very close on a second viewing.  I love the idea of showing individual shots and cutting or panning to another individual shot. Stitching together iconic moments before we truck out and form the full picture. I'd understand if that's not the intended direction and you want to be a stickler for the slow camera movement. If that's the case I'd really try and focus on how the reveal could shine more than just a simple overlay layer fading in. Make it have more impact. Make it meaningful.  The audio is really great. You've got something fun and appealing."

Which component (or components) is likely to represent the biggest bottleneck when rendering video? Put another way - is there an area I can afford to scrimp on a little? Do I really need an i7, or 32gb RAM, or a 4gb video card? Are any of these superfluous to video editing, or rather, going to provide less bang for my buck? Is there any noticeable benefit, for my purposes, from having 32gb RAM over 16 or 8, for instance?   At work I have a 64gb MacPro, 6gb video card, Xeon 8 core (I think). Obviously I can't afford anything like that (and am much more comfortable of Windows) but desperately need to upgrade from my Dell Studio laptop (i7, 8gb, old-school spinny HD...) as freelance work is a bit of a struggle on a burning hot 5 year old laptop.  Quite looking forward to putting in some research before I attempt a build, but if anyone has any quick tips on what specs I might need as a minimum it would be much appreciated!

editors,39v167,kissmyrobot,3,Tue Jun 16 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"First, generally, is there anything I should be wary of?   It's been my experience with features that unless the directors are editing, that the editors are editing concurrently with principal photography. There have been personal instances where that edit work needs to be turned around quickly to make sure a scene works before, say, the three days we have with a location are up. Make sure production is willing to deal with that level of overtime and see if they can get a PA to drive you home on those days if it becomes a safety issue. Health and safety is #1, don't let them push you in a bad position.  It sounds like this is a really bootstrapped type of production, I wouldn't be surprised if this issue comes up. I'm the kind of person who suggests against it but we can't be your mother if you want to be a hero.   I have a pretty powerful Windows PC I'll be editing on; do you foresee any issues   Eh, I probably wouldn't edit it in 4K. 4K still demands a lot in terms of disk setup at home for it to feel like editing 1080. I suggest editing in 1080p proxies. While it may slow you down a bit as footage is delivered (not really if it's transcoding while you're on set), it'll speed things up in the weeks that follow as you tackle the main edit. The ""little bit of lag here, little bit of render time there"" can add up over weeks, so much so that it might score you an extra day or two worth of true editing time.   We're shooting on an F5 in 4k, but not in raw; the files are .mxf. Should they be transcoded at all in any point in this? I'll be editing on premiere.   Well you have MPEG2, XAVC, and HDCAM SR as possible codecs. XAVC being the most common but I haven't used the Sony F series (well not since the F900) since they aren't nearly as popular a choice in the US. They're all MPEG family codecs which aren't the most nimble to edit on. On PC I would recommend converting to DNxHD wrapped quicktime (Avid's codec http://avid.force.com/pkb/articles/en_US/download/Avid-QuickTime-Codecs-LE) or GoPro Cineform which comes with the newest Premiere (you may need to install the free GoPro Studio for the codec to show up in Resolve). Both of them perform as well as Apple ProRes and can be encoded on PC.   I suggest making your dailies in something like DaVinci Resolve, it's made for batch processing and it'll keep metadata like timecode and tape name without jumping through hoops. It isn't really Premiere's job, so Premiere's toolset sucks here.   Media is being managed by card and by day   Once they're in your NLE, sort them by scene, not by day. Granted script notes will reference reel and clip number but you can cross reference so much metadata that you don't have to worry about that. Your basic building block is the scene, not the contents of the card and not the shuffled chronology of a shoot day.  For the film I'm currently AE on, we have two copies of the footage in Avid Media Composer, one sorted by reel and shoot day, the other by scene. The editor only works by scene but should the need arise to cross reference, then I have it sorted and available that way as well. It's been a nimble way to work.   How do you generally approach features?   Cut scene by scene and string it out like elriggo44 says. I would keep these first stringouts loose or based on nested sequences since you won't be locking scenes right away and they may need massive overhauls. Once you get a little bit closer to lock you can truly string them out using the true clips so you can work on scene transitions.  Don't worry about chronological order early in the edit work.  Ignore acts as building blocks. Acts are a storytelling guideline and I've found you need to craft them once the whole film is in place so you can check for tempo and story issues; from an assembly standpoint they're kind of meaningless because it's sort of a moving target. You'll have to break up the reels for finishing later on, and that can sometimes happen on a act break but it's mostly to reduce how much stuff needs to be swapped around if an edit revision is made during finishing.  Edit: Once you're about a week into shooting and have your days off, I don't mind swinging by and helping you sort through the footage so you can set yourself up for success. Cheers my friend."

editors,39v134,FrankPapageorgio,2,Mon Jun 15 03:11:25 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple. Open a fresh project. Use the solid generator to do a full screen white clip. Stretch it out for your projected project length. Attach a single exemplar video clip to it as a connected clip and drag it out to match the length. Dupe 8 more copies of the exemplar as connected clips as well. Select them all as a group and set the size. (x.33 of whatever raster your targeting) if you want a 3x3 grid like the exemplar open the inspector and type in new clip location coordinates to set the grid of the layout (it's the active raster width number  times .33 &amp;amp; .66 for thirds.) when you have the dummy grid setup, drag and drop your actual videos to replace the dummies using the ""replace to fit"" option. Now just edit each clip to taste. If you want similar fade ins and fade outs and flashes, cut the clips and apply a few  ""dip to color"" transitions set to maybe 5frames or so. Or cut clips and use the default cross fade to temporarily make a clip disappear. If you know X well, should take about 15-20 minuets and you shouldn't have to buy or search for anything. Once it exists, consider making it a big compound clip. That way it will reflect back up to your event browser and to do a new one, just drag it from the EB into a new project and drag and drop new videos into the existing windows. Hope that helps."

Unless they're using a 3rd party plugin with video drop zones in it, the best way is to just scale the video to 11%, put the clip in the grid position, and then put the next video on top in the new position.   Maybe do three compound clips with the individual rows if your computer likes to fuss about layered video.   It would be really easy in AE so maybe motion would be a simpler process than FCP, but I wouldn't know."
editors,39t43w,jmstone,4,Sun Jun 14 14:45:25 2015 UTC,Portfolio sites where someone can see full pieces you've edited are usually more effective than a reel. All a reel shows is that you can cut a montage. Music videos and commercial spots are short enough that someone should be able to go to a website and watch 3-5 pieces that you've done to get an idea of your work.
editors,39t43w,marMELade,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for confirming what I've told people for years. You can't really show editing from a reel, you have to show the whole piece.

editors,39t43w,goodnamesgone,4,Mon Jun 15 00:18:05 2015 UTC,"For an editing reel, don't cut everything together. Just put your best work in a sequence and separate them with black and a title card. Or, have them as separate clips on a website. For long form work, you may want to use selected portions, since most people won't watch an hour show."
editors,39t43w,tipsystatistic,6,Sun Jun 14 20:43:14 2015 UTC,"A few useful things that I've been told in the past:  1) Include ONLY your very best work, don't add something just because it fills up your reel.  2) Your reel should feel and flow like one element, not like a disjointed patchwork.  3) Don't be afraid to show your own personal style.   4) Less is more. This goes along with #1. It's better to have a few very strong pieces than a large assortment of work.  5) Lastly (though I'm sure other redditors can expand upon this very brief list) Depending on the type of work your seeking, you may want different types of reels. If you're doing broadcast, like a promotion writer, you may want more of a showreel. If you're trying to get AE jobs or other editing gigs, you want a clean and concise editing reel. Just keep your audience in mind.  If you have any questions about the above, or just wanna chat about any of this, feel free to PM me. Hope this helps."
editors,39t43w,KMazor,2,Sun Jun 14 15:10:34 2015 UTC,Who told you a reel has to flow?  It doesn't. A drama editor is perfectly fine to have 3 or so short scenes from films they've cut.   Same with commercials and documentaries.   A simple fade to black with simple graphics explaining what we're seeing is all that needed.
editors,39t43w,bottom,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:35:49 2015 UTC,"2) Your reel should feel and flow like one element, not like a disjointed patchwork.   How do you do that when your work ranges vastly?"

People seemed to have taken it to mean that your reel should look like a section of the film Birdman. When really all that's meant is that your selections of edits/scenes should be well assembled pieces. The way it was described to me a long time ago is in relation to photos. Poorly selecting a section of your work can come off feeling similar to poorly cropping a photo. Each sample should frame your edits well. So the ""flow"" is really just as simple as making sure each sample shows enough of your ability and enters/exits at comfortable points."

It's a fast fun montage sizzle, shows off no real editing work but it shows off that I can handle big names and big projects.   Then on the side, I'll make another reel that is much longer, showing off longer scenes, full commercials, etc. that has a title card of what the project is, and some details about the project.

Also looking at making it around at 1.30 tops. There will be a link to my website where you can easily see the standalone pieces if you were curious (speaking generally).

Music videos - show a few short example Documentary - show some scenes you've cut.    Don't bother with a montage. They mean nothing.   If you were looking for an editor what would you want to see?

editors,39t43w,penilehubris,0,Mon Jun 15 11:53:37 2015 UTC,"because anyone can cut a decent montage, easily - sure there are good ones bad one, but editing is about telling stories, sometimes the stories are abstract, but the story is important.  a montage, it shows you can cut a montage, nothing else - and as i've said they're easily done. i guess they show very basic editing skills.  i used to have a montage on my reel years ago - waste of time."
editors,39t43w,bottom,2,Mon Jun 15 13:32:08 2015 UTC,"I'll add to this because I think it is very important. When I am hiring someone, I want to see what they have done in a professional capacity. I want to see their work as it appeared in the final product. A montage is  basically the opposite of that. It's just something that you made out of pieces from something else and doesn't reflect anything relevant.  I also like to see a title, what kind of project (feature, doc, etc) and year for each piece."
editors,39ryi0,HungryLikeTheWolf99,4,Sun Jun 14 04:22:56 2015 UTC,"It's late and I've had a couple drinks, so kindly pardon the vulgarity but:  30.00 FPS is bullshit. What you have is variable frame rate footage. It's contained in an MPEG container, but you need to put that stuff in a constant frame rate format.  Frame blending is a bad idea for the time being. Unless you're looking for weird motion blur, ignore it. For the most part I recommend using ffmpeg to make a DNxHD file like so:   ffmpeg -i (file) -c:v dnxhd -b:v 145M -c:a pcm_s16le -r 60000/1001 (output).mov   This should produce a 29.97 59.94 (constant) FPS DNxHD file that you can ingest into your system. Convert to meet deliverable specs within Media Composer as necessary.  Note: That will produce 720p59.94 compliant media. Adjust as necessary for other formats.  Edit: fixed a small error. I'm using 59.94 because ffmpeg's DNxHD encoder can handle that. Based on what I've read I don't know if ffmpeg can make 720p29.97 media for DNxHD."

editors,39rsyw,AAARRGHH,2,Sun Jun 14 03:25:21 2015 UTC,Agreed. No reason in my mind to bake the matte into the video until the final render.

editors,39rsyw,LochnessDigital,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:11:45 2015 UTC,That's a good point but you could always scale up and crop and still adjust the composition which is not ideal...
editors,39rsyw,wescotte,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:12:01 2015 UTC,I understand the thoughts behind this and I've brought it up...but unfortunately I'm not in a position myself to make that decision.
editors,39rsyw,LochnessDigital,2,Sun Jun 14 03:53:51 2015 UTC,"The answer to your question:  Edit: See comment below mine.  If you crop it to 2.35:1 in redcine-x but export to 1080p ProRes files, it will include the black bars. You have to do this on a clip to clip basis, though. There's no batch action of cropping all your files the same.  The only way to do this quickly is by setting the crop settings in cam before shooting. This way, when importing into redcine-x, the software can read the metadata and know how you wanted it framed.  My advice:  Now, all that being said, I personally wouldn't go about adding black bars to footage before the edit. I also wouldn't restrict the editors to a 1080p file when you have what I would assume are 4k files to work with. Post stabilization, color grading, noise reduction, reframing, vfx and other destructive processes are all much better when done in the native 4K and then downscaled to 1080p rather than with 1080p files in a 1080p project.  If the computer can't handle it, you can learn about editing offline, or with proxy files.  And like another user posted in the comments, if you must edit with 1080p files, it is quite easy to overlay black bars over the entire timeline, which gives you freedom to at least reframe vertically during the edit.  And about saving render time, the best way to do this would be to actually crop the files to 1920 x 816 instead of 1920 x 1080 with black bars. If you don't need them, get those useless pixels out of there."
editors,39rsyw,odintantrum,2,Sun Jun 14 04:09:31 2015 UTC,"So I guess I should clarify...the intent is that the files I create will be the offline files. The editor wants the 2.35 baked in so he can cut with a pre-defined idea of the frame and online later.   To complicate things further, the cut is being done in FCP7. I tested the 1920x816 method, but the program stretches the footage when fullscreened -- which the editor also doesn't want."
editors,39rsyw,odintantrum,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:31:05 2015 UTC,If you just output masked clips at 1080 you get black bars.
editors,39rsyw,kissmyrobot,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:40:46 2015 UTC,"This is right but you can do batch centre crops. In your framing tab make a 2.35:1 mask, think you can confirm the aspect ratio is correct by clicking lock aspect ratio. When you have done this for your first clip some where near the top there's an option to save the framing as a preset (like you can with looks) then simply his apply to all clips in bin."

editors,39osz6,jfreed,4,Sat Jun 13 08:54:24 2015 UTC,"In Premiere do the following:   Create a timeline, add video clips and your unbroken audio clip and sync as you see fit (PluralEyes can help at this stage) you should be left with video clips placed correctly above a long unbroken sync sound clip. For each video clip add cuts into the audio sequence at the beginning and end of the video clip. Select this video and audio (the newly cut clip thats the exact length of the video), right click and merge. Because you're merging from the timeline, it considers the audio trimmed and you won't have a ton of black leader or tail. Continue down your timeline until merged clips are created for all video clips. You can set up shortcut keys for cutting on the playhead, selecting the clips under the playhead, and merging. The process can go fairly quickly.   Assuming no matching timedcode, in Avid it's fairly similar (subsequence), or you could subclip the audio first and merge to the video, it's not really any faster either way than Premiere. It's just AE bread and butter work.  If everything has usable timecode, Avid can autosync and it will trim the audio to the length of the video - it gives precedence to the video duration. Unless the project is massive, I wouldn't switch NLEs over something like this, but Avid kicks ass in this department.  I'm not a fan of adding sync sound to dailies before it hits your NLE, creates too many issues when conforming/consolidating for post sound mixing."

At this point I cut all the excess audio out so I'm just left with audio clips synced with video clips. Here you can do as described, merge these clips, but I just put all the synced clips together one after the other and then view this sequence in the sources monitor where I add markers, i/o points or make subclips while doing my main edit."

You're basically cutting in the audio or overcutting in the new merged clips. This usually screws the pooch unless there is some deadline to see an assembly edit.  What I was initially referring to is adding audio to your dailies (Avid needs footage converted to its editing codec, there are exceptions but I wont get into that) so your clip already comes in with several tracks of audio, thanks to some sync work being done in an application like Resolve. This creates issues with being able to refer back to the original audio clip when it's delivered for sound mixing unless the goal is, again, some massive need for speed in editing."
editors,39osz6,elriggo44,2,Sat Jun 13 12:02:57 2015 UTC,"Every show I have worked on we will synch up the audio and video in Avid, make a sub sequence and use the auto sync feature to turn that subsequence into a sub clip.   Either that or we have dailies techs render the video and audio out in Resolve and export as DNx36."

editors,39o7a8,TheElCaminoKid,3,Sat Jun 13 04:26:58 2015 UTC,"It seems the biggest bottleneck is your laptop. If you need more performance from your desktop, you could always upgrade parts and add more hard drives into it to speed video editing up. That's relatively cheap compared to getting a completely new machine. Just giving it an SSD, more ram, you are going to be at the higher end of editing machines still. So thats why I'd get a new laptop instead."
editors,39o7a8,bassmasta187,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:58:10 2015 UTC,"I'm having trouble understanding why you're buying hardware.  It sounds like your desktop is fine for another two years. If you get a UHD (or 4k—they're very rare) display an nvidia 750 should do fine. Look at a 970 if you want to get something powerful.  An iMac isn't going to be substantially faster than what you have if it's faster at all. Additionally it won't solve the carrying around a large laptop issue.  You mention your Fragbook with no complaints about power, just complaints about ergonomics. You spent the money on it, sounds like it's time to sell it or live with it for a few years and get your money's worth out of it.  When I look at your message I see two things, both of which aren't financially sustainable. The first is you're insisting on top shelf equipment. There's a difference between the best equipment and the best-cost equipment. Look for a better blend of price and value. Think about a 750, a 970, and a 980. What they cost, what they can do, how long they'll last. There's a sweet spot for your budget, and I'm guessing a $500 video board that's worth less than $200 in three years isn't that spot.  The other thing I see is you're looking to throw money at hardware, not problems. An iMac doesn't fix the heavy laptop problem. The laptop sounds functional, just a bit cumbersome. Get your money out of it. Your desktop sounds plenty powerful, it's just lacking a UHD monitor, which you may or may not need. I'm sure it looks pretty good on your displays as it is and give plenty of reference for framing and color. If you aren't seeing it in UHD chances are anyone looking at the videos while they're still relevant (particularly for real estate) won't be looking at them in UHD either. So you probably don't need to be UHD yet, but it isn't bad to be there.  My advice is take a step back, think about what problems you expect new hardware to solve, then find a good way to go about solving them. Maybe the problem is needing UHD monitoring. Solve it. Maybe the problem is needing a refined way (not a Fragbook) to present to clients. Solve it. Maybe you're fine sitting on what you've got for a little while. Save the money. If you're always trying to have the latest your business won't be profitable. When you're doing enough work you'll know when it's time to buy."
editors,39o7a8,soundman1024,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:35:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this well thought out response.   The real estate company I do business with likes having the 4K footage, to them it's more marketing than functionality. Everyone look! we've got 4K drone footage, nobody else has that! So to them it's worth while and to be honest, I like having it in my portfolio.   So my question is of priority, Which would you rather have first? A rock solid desktop workstation? or a better mobile solution for what is essentially marketing and client appeasement. Because Mac = Professional in the minds of these people. I take out my ""fragbook"" and clients comment about how big it is, and the screen is pretty dull and doesn't compliment the footage at all.   You're right, I need to take a step back and think about the problems I need solved.   I'm leaning towards a better desktop workstation, and from what i've heard so far, a 5K iMac is the wrong move. My desktop pc is bottle necked by GPU, ram, and disk speed, and takes awhile to process UDH footage. IT WILL DO IT, but I have to stop and go make sandwiches ALL the time.. As mentioned in an earlier post to upgrade that would be around 2.5k without SSD drives, with SSD drives it could easily be an additional $1K. Now... I spec'd out a 6 core MacPro with dual 6gb GPUs and 32gb ram for around $5500 with tax. At this point i'm thinking it's worth waiting a little and saving up for that particular system. Now that will solve my power problem, but not display problem. I only need one 4k preview display, I have a ton of 1080 IPS monitors lying around so that won't be a problem.   What are your thoughts? Thanks again for the advice, it will not be taken lightly."
editors,39o7a8,soundman1024,2,Sat Jun 13 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"It sounds like it's time to swap the Fragbook out. You need to look at the economics of a mobile editing solution versus a client monitoring solution. Do you really need the power to edit while you're out and about or can you get away with a screen and enough horespower to play a video? I'm not sure what you use-case is for your Fragbook.  If it's for showing off videos but not really for editing I think a portable all-in-one is worth checking out. They're basically 20"" tablets. You'll look pretty cool showing your stuff on a large screen, but they don't get much beyond HD if they go beyond HD. As cool as they seem sometimes meeting expectations is what you need to do. Your clients need to feel justified in hiring you. They want to feel like you're a professional. When you show up with what the expect (Macbook) they feel more confident. If your editing is going to be at the workstation look at a used 15"" with retina display. Given the CPU and GPU options in a brand new top shelf MBP you're buying an outdated machine. Might as well buy a used machine and save $1000 over an outdated new machine. Or wait for truly new Macbooks to hit the market with more current components.    As for your workstation, the GPU and RAM are affordable upgrades. Disk speed probably isn't an issue.  When you think about video it's the ideal situation for a spinning disc. You absolutely want a solid state boot, but your media can happily live on a spinning disc. You're reading continuous chunks of data, not doing small random I/O requests. I don't know what camera you're shooting, but very few cameras that fly will challenge a single spinning disc for I/O. Look up the bitrate your camera shoots at and the bitrate that spinning discs deliver. I think you'll be surprised by how well even Green drives stack up. I'm not recommending Green drives for editing as they present other issues, just pointing out that disc speed isn't a big problem for cameras that fly. If you want to fly a RED and shoot RAW you'll need a RAID and all that, but if you have a GH4 or similar just make sure you're getting middle-of-the-road or better drives and you're on your backup game.  As for upgrades, look for 24-32GB of RAM. That's a good place to be based on the specs you shared. That shouldn't be too expensive. If you're using After Effects as much as you can afford is the answer.  On the GPU front I think a 970 is a much better value than a 980ti. If you plan on building another box and taking the 980ti with you into the new machine then it's a great choice. It sounds more likely that within 2-3 years you'll replace the whole system. In that case you want a GPU that you'll be happy with for 2-3 years before you build another monster. The 980ti will certainly get it done, but is it $400 better than a 970? Particularly if the 970 can give you realtime performance in Premiere? Maybe you have to drop to half. You're still editing without transcoding or waiting, it just takes a bit of time on the way out.  The MacPro is in the same boat as the Macbook Pro. Outdated components on the inside. The tube is completely unchanged since it was introduced in 2013. So you're buying two year old hardware. Wait for new components on the inside before pulling the trigger there.    If you were into VFX, animation, multicam, etc. I would advocate for the fastest components you can afford, but for editing drone footage you don't need the most powerful computer around, you need enough to be functional without breaking the bank and you want to stagger your capital purchases.   Year 1: workstation Year 2: drone/gimbal Year 3: laptop, workstation upgrade Year 4: camera   It sounds like you're at year 3 right now. Year 2 and Year 4 might need a swap? Not too sure. Year 1 will be the most expensive, so you want to end up ahead at the end of year 4 anticipating a larger purchase the following year.    Just some thoughts. You know your business and needs better than I do. Cheers!"

That said, there is a setting for the plugin, in AE's effects panel not the effect's GUI that sets how many frames to average noise from, higher is usually better but far slower.

editors,39ixi2,jacon_bacon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:54:52 2015 UTC,I'd love to and I will eventually.  Just had enough money for the one at the moment.  Just curious where the bottleneck really would be.
editors,39ixi2,orismology,3,Fri Jun 12 05:10:19 2015 UTC,I would upgrade your system drive first. That's likely where you'd get the largest performance improvement. I'd say it's unlikely that your rendering bottleneck is at the hard drive.
editors,39ixi2,Kichigai,2,Fri Jun 12 14:28:20 2015 UTC,Depends on what they're working on. Once their program is up and running most of it is resident in memory and doesn't do any loading. Thus in the case of something like After Effects (where all effects are loaded into RAM so the artist can see what they're working on) the render drive may in fact be what's holding them back.
editors,39ixi2,benedictcabot,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking too.  The obvious solution is to use many SSDs but ya know.  Money.  I figured if I upgraded the drive that held all the files Premiere would be drawing from, it might loosen everything up.  I could have a super fast Premiere program but if it's pulling files out of mud, what's the point?"
editors,39ixi2,blue_delicious,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:34:17 2015 UTC,I agree with this
editors,39ixi2,SlenderLlama,3,Fri Jun 12 15:05:21 2015 UTC,"It's impossible to say whether or not an SSD will affect your render times without knowing everything else about your system, but from my experience as an editor and former IT tech, I doubt an SSD will have a significant impact. It will have a significant impact on loading times, for boot up and program launching if used as your system drive, or for project assets if used for your storage drive. Rendering speed is more dependent on your GPU, CPU, and RAM."
editors,39ixi2,SlenderLlama,2,Fri Jun 12 17:48:21 2015 UTC,"Okay! Replacing your C:/ drive with a SSD, will makes Windows/MacOS load up much faster. FCP or Premiere, or Avid, or whatever, will open up much faster too. You might see a slight increase in render times, but only if your current hard drive is the bottleneck. Your render times are mostly dependent on your CPU.  I like using my SSD as a scratch disc, but editing off a drive that's not an SSD is barely noticeable (Assuming we're still using SATA interfaces, USB is terrible to edit off). It takes a little more time in the beginning to find all the clips and put them in the sequence, but we're talking seconds unless this is a feature film, in which you'd be using massive RAID arrays.  An SSD is a worthwhile replacement because everything just works faster. As an editor, the faster things work, the fast I could theoretically work also. So these are things I was able to justify, but if you're doing freelance, and are having performance issues, your hardrive may not be the place to look. That could be because of your OS, CPU, or RAM.   TL;DR, an SSD won't make your render times faster, but it makes the  editing process a bit more ideal with today's current hardware."
editors,39ixi2,bassmasta187,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:13:50 2015 UTC,"Well I upgraded to 16 GB of RAM awhile ago and no change.  Switched out to an SSD and got a small improvement.

I'll list what I do:   Import all footage into Premiere Select all clips, audio and video, that need to be synced Right click, new multicam sequence Once the processing is finished I right click, open in timeline Copy all clips synced to a new timeline that isn't multicam (I really hate using the multicam controls)   What you can do then is take all of the audio tracks and put them into a nested sequence (select clips on the timeline, right click, Nest).  Then you can control each clip / track individually in the nest, but have only one audio clip on your video timeline.  Hope this helps.  Feel free to PM me if you have any additional questions."

I made it about 1:15 in and felt like I was watching much of the same thing over and over and stopped right there. It also feels more like a DP's reel. If you can cut sound ups in do it! If you can change the song up, do it? You have a great little graphic animation up top. Consider using those colors and create some transitions.   It's by no means a bad reel, but it doesn't really stand out to me. I would also suggest you make a separate reel of just your wedding work.   I personally don't really think the song works well with the wedding content and there can also be a stigma that if you edit wedding videos you probably aren't good enough to cut more higher profile work.

editors,39ijmf,thisisausername67,5,Thu Jun 11 23:25:15 2015 UTC,"AFP is actually a very old protocol that Apple is trying to phase out of their products. Since OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) they've been skewing the OS to prefer SMB (that is, if you don't explicitly tell it which protocol to use, it'll default to SMB if it can) for performance and compatibility reasons.  What you're comparing here are two vastly different protocols. One provides file-level access, the other provides block-level access.  With AFP, SMB, NFS, and WebDAV, your computer only has access to the individual files. It can see the files, it can write to the files, it can manipulate the metadata of the file, long story short it has full access to the files. The disk, however, is handled by the remote server (the Synology NAS or SNS EVO in this case). That is where the drive is actually mounted, and that is the machine directly controlling all drive-level things (defragging, managing the file system, etc). None of that ever reaches the remote computer, it only sees files. That, actually, is the secret sauce that allows multiple people to read and write to one of these shares at the same time. Since one computer is managing the physical drive, it arbitrates disk access so the remote computers don't step all over each others' toes and damage the file system in the process.  iSCSI, however, is a very different beast. It provides block-level access. Block-level access is the kind of access you get on your internal and external hard disks. Except for the on-drive controller (the little board on the underside) there is nothing between your computer and the platters inside the drive. iSCSI is basically just a way of extending the internal cabling of a computer out across a network. In the case of a NAS or SAN it's not a physical drive but a partition or disk image that you have access to, but it's still very direct access to that data. And since only one computer can access a physical disk at any time, that's why only one computer can access an iSCSI share at a time.  Some systems allow read-only access to iSCSI shares mounted elsewhere, but because your computer sees it as a block-level device it expects that it is the only machine accessing it, so it doesn't see any changes made by other computers. It thinks the data hasn't changed since the last time it glanced at the drive, and will stick to those guns unless something nudges it to take another look. This is in contrast to a file-level protocol, which knows it isn't the only computer accessing the data, and will periodically ask the remote server if there have been any changes.  Now, you asked about consistency. Typically because a computer has the most direct access to the data iSCSI tends to be faster and more consistent than AFP. You have direct control over the file system, which means you can elect to use one that's better at managing smaller files or larger files. Since it's mostly-direct access the protocol just spews raw bits it doesn't care what's in there, and thus performance remains pretty consistent. It basically behaves like a really slow hard disk.  AFP, however, is less consistent, and should deliver worse performance in most cases. Since you have a server arbitrating access to the files your performance is dictated by that machine. Because of the arbitration the impact on the server tends to be higher, as it has to both manage the disk(s) and all remote access requests, which it must translate from raw files to something communicated over the protocol. It was designed for access to documents, images, HyperCard stacks and what have you. That type of communication is very ""bursty.""  An AFP client says ""hand me this file,"" and the server communicates the whole file to the client and the client holds and manipulates it in memory until it tells the server to rewrite the file with this data in it. Communication is done in bursts. Now in video editing we don't access files in this way. We say ""I want this part of this file,"" or ""I want from this point of this file to that point of this file."" The access we require is ""streamy.""  Direct access to the data is very efficient for accessing parts of streams as the file system knows exactly where on the disk a particular part of a data stream is, so when you say you want a part of a file the file system sends the read/write heads directly off to that spot on the disk and gets to work. iSCSI does something very much like that, since it's basically just an extension cable for a hard disk or disk partition. AFP, however, must sit there and think to itself ""OK, the client wants this file. Now it's asking for this part of the file. Now I need to ask the file system where that part of that file is. Now I need to translate the raw data from HFS+ to AFP."" It has to do this for each and every segment of each and every file that's accessed. Individual parts must be addressed in this way. It's very inefficient as the client must first read the header of each file to know which parts of the file it needs to request. It's also inefficient on the client side as it has to pretend the AFP share is a disk whenever any piece of software wants to access data from it, which involves a process similar to the server's.  To that end, iSCSI is typically preferred for video editing. It's typically preferred for most applications, actually. It's a common topic in /r/sysadmin and /r/homelab. Now as to why you saw better speeds from AFP than iSCSI, I can't answer that. Could be any of a number of variables that effected your results. But on the whole iSCSI tends to be faster and more consistent than AFP."
editors,39ijmf,Kichigai,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:20:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the super detailed response!   All of your reasons sum up exactly why I went with iSCSI for the particular project, but then I started doing some research on systems like EditShare and the AFP/SMB options of the EvO systems, and noticed that EditShare uses AFP to share/lock project files and media between edit systems.   iSCSI seems to make the most logical sense. There just seems to be a little more work and workarounds with sharing projects etc. But I was curious because of a robust system like EditShare actively uses AFP/SMB as their protocol, then it couldn't be the worst thing in the world.   As for the performance i'm almost positive it was something in the stack of equipment / software I was using that was bottlenecking, as it took me 4 days to get from miserable 50mb/s to 800mb/s like it should have been via iSCSI.  I had a 48TB Synology Nas link aggregated over 10GbE to a 12port 10GbE Netgear switch, then ran a single 10GbE line out to a SanLink2 10GbE to Thunderbolt2 adapter and used iSanMP to mount the volumes. Something was funny with the error checking settings on both the Synology iSCSI settings as well as the iSanMP settings which was causing erratic speeds, but I finally found a combo of settings that seemed to fix it.   I think when I start to re-purpose the NAS and add more storage I'll stick with iSCSI and a single AFP Share volume for the whole office to use. Unless you have a personal suggestion for how you would set up 4 Edit machines over a 10GbE network?   I've also been toying with the idea of being able to mount an iSCSI mount over AFP/SMB on each machine and being able to copy files onto it from another computer if needed.   Edit 1 iSCSI Mount -> SMB Share -> Edit2 logs into Edit1 via SMB and copies files onto Edit1 iSCSI Mount  Yes, that's piping data through a lot of protocols and it would take a performance hit, but shouldn't be terrible if just copying/moving files.  I'm not sure if copying over SMB into an iSCSI mount will interfere at all with the host computer's iSCSI mount or not."
editors,39g68o,wobyen,3,Thu Jun 11 14:35:05 2015 UTC,"Before you try anything else, consider the easy workaround: just export your timeline as a flattened Quicktime Prores 422 clip, then import into the Resolve Media Pool through the Scene Detect process.  If you want to solve the issue then read on.  Davinci Resolve returns the error while parsing (reading/interpreting) the XML file. In other words, it found something unexpected in the file structure. Remember that Premiere and Resolve are using a standard (Final Cut Pro XML) that is proprietary to Apple and for which no official document has been released (it has been reverse-engineered by the companies using it). Maybe something in your timeline causes Premiere to do some funky thing in the XML and Resolve does not know how to deal with it.   Things to try:   Can you re-import this XML into Premiere without error?  If you have access to FCP7, can you load it in there? FCP7 will display an error log if it finds anything wrong with the file. Something might be wrong with your sequence settings vs. clip format. Maybe it uses a codec/format that Resolve is allergic to. Check Sequence Settings, set it to Prores 422. Is frame rate correct? Are you mixing frame rates and format in the sequence? Remove all crossfades, motion keyframes and effects from your Premiere timeline and try exporting an XML and importing it into Resolve. If that works, then maybe one of your transitions is responsible. Create a new sequence with the correct settings. Cut and paste all of your clips into it and try with this one. The error might be caused by a specific clip in the timeline. Make a new timeline with only the first half of your edit and import that into Resolve, then repeat with the second half. If one half triggers the error but not the other, then divide the guilty half in two; rinse and repeat until you've identified the guilty clip. It might sound useless, but I once had a timeline that made Resolve crash upon XML import, and I used that method to identify the specific clip. Even though I had about 600 cuts in the edit, it took me less than 20 minutes to go through this process and identify the problematic clip (which I rendered and replaced in the timeline). If nothing works, contact Blackmagic Design support. Also post on their Resolve forum, on LiftGammaGain, and on Creative Cow."

I was just a news editor, not a photog, but that said I have a pretty good understanding of what you do now and the general structure of a local news affiliate.  Just for context, I've since left the position and now freelance full time.    How easy/hard is the transition over from news?   Commercial/Marketing production is a whole different ball game from news. You'll need to think more outside of the box. Instead of working to conform to the established style, you'll need to invent it for each new client.  Copywriting   You'll have more time to work on stuff, but you'll need it.    From a technical standpoint, you'll need to know more than just editing.  You'll need to be able to do some light graphic design, motion graphics, color, audio.  You'll also need to understand the workflow a little more.  I imagine you are coming from some sort of content management system from the newsroom, in marketing you'll be handling all of that yourself.    What do you love about it? HATE about it?   When you get a client that gets your ideas and lets you execute on them, it can be really fun.  When you get a client that is only about their own ideas, it can be trying.   *What is a typical day like? Typical week?  You'll typically work normal hours, weekends off, and get all holidays.  I worked out of an edit bay and stayed fairly busy, so my days consisted of working on spots, meeting with clients, brainstorming and coming up with proposals, email and typical administrative stuff.  I'd go out on shoots 2-3 times a month.  *What do you wish someone had told YOU before your started?  I used to have photogs come in my bay and lament how they wish they had my job. How they are tired of being on call, running live shots, zipping all over town at the whim of the assignment editor. What they didn't realize is that many days I wish I had their job.  While they get to leave the building, go outside, talk to people, see and interact with the city,  I sit in a dark edit bay starting at the same 30 second spot all day.  But then at 5:30 I go home.

For a two minute long video it took forever to get those through. But it worked, everything was self contained and even the backups had backups in case the studio burned to the ground. For me, it was insanely eye opening since I'm used to editing on a smaller scale...So I can appreciate your freaking out."
editors,39b1rl,elriggo44,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:27:45 2015 UTC,"Also, if the sequences are from promo or advertising the ""roughs"" you are taking about could be different timed spots.   When I worked in promos we delivered a 60 a 45 a 30 and a 15 second spot in one sequence with 10/30 seconds if black between them. (Depending on the network or firms specs)  The timeline you linked to looks very similar to any advertising or promo timeline I have ever worked on. Especially once they are locked for final delivery."

I had a lot of responsibility, and I think I actually made some great work.   Sounds like an awesome position! I find that most places aren't going to ask the content. They might ask out of general curiosity, but a romcom vs a drama probably won't make or break your chance at the job. They may ask if it was scripted or non-scripted, in which case, you probably get to say it was scripted, right?  People in this industry are pretty progressive (I've found) and people in Portland are especially progressive (I've heard). I think you'll be okay. Focus on the hard work you did and don't fixate on the porn aspect so much, as it's really nothing to be ashamed of."

The one that sends you the checks anyway) and listed my responsibilities. In that industry you are required to push out a ton of content in a bunch of different formats in a timely manner, etc, etc.   The point being: what I did was more important that who I did it for. If they ask, the NDA thing is pretty brilliant and I wish I had thought of that. If you don't want to go that route, just say that it was a small production company that made a bunch of stuff of a niche market that you've probably never seen.

What I can tell you from my experience is that people only kind of half-read resumes anyway. You could leave the seven months blank, and then if you get an interview, when they ask if you have any questions, ask them if there's anything they see on your resume that they're worried about that you can maybe clear up then and there. If they notice/ask about the gap, then tell them. If you feel out the room and it seems like it won't bother them, you can mention it in the interview. That's my $0.02."

editors,39bbeu,Jesster32388,3,Wed Jun 10 16:29:21 2015 UTC,"Union editor here - my advice would be to just get on the eligibility roster, but don't actually join the union and pay your dues until you are booked on a union show. You have to take a couple safety courses (which they pay you to take!) and then if you do find a union job, you can tell them you're eligible and then pay your dues and officially join.   Actually being in the union isn't going to help you get a union job as far as I'm aware - it's just that roster eligibility that matters. Otherwise the job will have to wait for you to take the safety courses, get your non-union hours verified, etc - which means they'll probably just hire someone else."

From what I understand it's just a blanket liability thing to keep insurance costs down."

editors,39bbeu,elriggo44,2,Thu Jun 11 06:46:17 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely the advice I give as well.   Once you pay the $1500 (or whatever it is now) to join the union you are expected to start paying dues. Meanwhile, you don't automatically get the health coverage or the unions support. You have to be on a union show for 3 months to get the health benefits and a union show in general to get their protection or help.   So wait until you've booked something.   Now, how to book a union gig? Reach out to anyone you know that works union gigs. Tell them that you are trying to make the jump.   Most people are very helpful. It's becoming easier to move from reality to scripted as the first/second generation of reality workers have started trickling in.   Personally I prefer to hire reality assistants because. They have seen it all. They tend to be more technical and have a greater understanding of the way avid works. 2. I feel like, as a former really editor and assistant, it's my duty to help people gtfo if that's what they want. I was helped by some amazing people to whom I owe a debt of gratitude. I don't know if I'll ever be able to repay them, but I can hire from the reality pool to help more people get out!!  Scripted is different. The post super/AP rarely hires assistants. It's all editors. So you need to meet as many scripted editors as you can.   It may be easier to meet these editors by taking a step back for a few gigs and PAing. Yes, I know it blows, but PAs are hired easier and you will get to know a bunch of people. If they like you they will remember you and will consider you for future gigs."
editors,39bbeu,elriggo44,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:44:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response! I'm coming more from a television and film marketing background instead of reality, but I have done much more trouble shooting on this job then any reality one I've had so far.  My goal (as it is with many I assume) is to land a gig at a scripted production. From what I've heard though, it's very difficult to find an in for a position like that.   But after I get on the roster, I'm just going to put my self out there and try to get in contact with as many people as possible.  Thanks again for the reply!"
editors,39bbeu,megasgreg,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:05:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, I don't want to fully join until landing a job. I just want to be eligible with the roster. My friend who's in the union was the one spurred this on, saying that if he put in a word for me, I needed to be ready to go with my paperwork.  Outside of my one friend though, I have no idea how to try and get in the room for one of the positions. If you don't mind me asking, how do you or your production find AE's? Is it just through word of mouth or is there a place they look?     *edit for misspelling"
editors,39bbeu,c-span_celebrity,2,Wed Jun 10 18:37:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as far as I can tell (and in my own experience getting the job) it's the same as anything else - just word of mouth and keeping in touch with people you worked with on other non-union stuff. In this case the production company has several non-union shows, I believe the AEs just came over from other shows at the company.   It seems like most people don't have their eligibility worked out in advance, so you'll definitely have a leg up on a lot of the competition if you can just be ready to take a job at a moment's notice! Though the momentum seems to have stalled for the time being, there were a lot more shows going union late last year, so hopefully that trend continues and there are more jobs to go around."
editors,39bbeu,purplesnowcone,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:56:02 2015 UTC,Hopefully heh. What I'm learning is that just being eligible and trying to make as many connections as possible is the way to go. So I'll stick with that and make some things happen! Thanks again for your responses!

Avoid drinking too much during the week. Don't start workdays tired or hungover. You're in a mental marathon, you want to start your day reasonably well.  Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner. Portion size and timing is less important, but spread your eating out all day, don't skip meals, and don't eat at your desk.  Hydration is huge. Large as fuck source of water safely near your desk. Recycled computer air is dry and dusty, lots of water helps, it also builds in regular stand up and go to the bathroom breaks.  Learn Keyboard shortcuts. No part of using a computer is economically accurate to how humans are ""supposed"" to be. So your body is always under a degree of stress while working, but with that said, a keyboard is less physically stressful than a mouse.  Move the keyboard, mouse, and displays in placement and height till everything is as close to a natural resting position for yourself as you can get.  Exercise on your off days and get outdoors. It's not just whether you're sedentary, it's also whether you're accidentally isolating yourself from the world in your edit suite. Don't forget to engage with the rest of humanity.  Learn exercises to combat eye strain and carpel tunnel. There's a wealth of info online to find the tactics and tools that suit you.  Be prepared to spend big for preventative health. This may mean standup desks, better chairs, better shoes, keeping the room at a different temperature...it can show up a lot of ways, and you need to build that cost into your business margins because preventative care is still the cheapest form of personal health care.  Read real books. Good for your brain, good for your eyes, good for your soul.  If you drink coffee, get rid of the sugars and creams. They'll make you fat.

editors,3993om,GeorgePantsMcG,3,Wed Jun 10 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"First of all I like it a lot!  A couple of notes, my personal opinion without any many courtesies ;)  1) I shared a video for review while it was being processed. It did not send the e-mail before the transcode was done (or it seems so from the timing of the arrival of the share e-mail anyway). It would be nice with a notification saying ""Your share will be send when transcode is done. Click here to get notified by e-mail when your client has received the share"" or something.  2): 15 second tutorial. Cool, good idea, but why waste peoples precious time with an intro? Btw. I would in some way communicate that the video had no sound as I tried turning up my speakers and missed some of the tutorial (usually tutorials has a voice over).  3)  Consider tweaking the tutorial. Maybe text overlay ""Click on video to make a comment""  4) I uploaded a video in the beginning of the tour and just did the processes, thus skipping the tour I think? The pink overlay was covering video buttons and confusing me. And I never got the tour (didn't matter much though, as your GUI is great and intuitive).  5) Infoboxes on icons and such with mouse hover would be nice.  6) Would be nice with a folder within a folder and ability to drag and drop OS-style.  7) Password protected folders for individual users. We have asked iogates for this also, and they're yet to deliver (but say they will). When you work in a big organization, also with freelancers, this is a high priority feature for a lot of people.  I must say it's a pretty great product! We use iogates, but the user friendliness is way higher here. This is why we love iogates (also):  FTP-upload  Takes all pro codecs (we like to upload XDCAM HD50 mxf)  Fast connection (often we upload 8-14GB files).  Fast transcode.  This makes for a quick proces from Avid to the EP et al."

TONS of corporate video like web films/stories.  Very little TV out here.

I knew guys that lost corporate gigs for getting coffee runs wrong as PAs, and the city killed off most chances for major film productions thanks to their handling of the parking meters.

Or roll the dice and find untapped talent in small places?  Commercials, scripted or unscripted TV?  Movies?  Or just volume?  The most creative works seems to come out of London and parts of Europe.  High quality creative stuff out of LA just because they have the director talent local. NY is okay but the work there tends to be much less creative. London and LA you'll get good reel work (in terms of commercials).  Austin and Boulder have some agencies and good commercial work.  But not a ton. Same in San Fran. Just not the same volume of work.   For TV and film, it's all still NY and LA. Even when they shoot other places, the dailies come back home here.

editors,396ec9,kickinthehead,2,Tue Jun 9 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"As a reformed LA hater myself, let me say that you'd do well to dismiss the ire that gets directed toward this city. There was a post on r/losangeles a few days ago that summed up our attitudes on that pretty well, titled ""when out-of-towners talk trash"" or something like that: http://i.imgur.com/2KBy1mm.png  We're basically too busy soaking in the amazingness of this city to waste time hating on other places. But everyone that hasn't lived here looooves to hate on us. Hate us 'cause they ain't us, maybe? I've never been able to figure it out.  It's a tough place to visit because it's just so damn huge. It isn't as easy to get from landmark A to landmark B as some other places, so visitors get the impression that half your life is spent in traffic. Living here is a very different experience (as long as you don't choose to live somewhere deep in the valley to save a few dollars a month that will make your commute 90+ minutes daily). Things that are amazing about LA:  1) The food is killer, and the variety is unending. So many transplants here from all over the world that you could find top-notch eateries serving any kind of cuisine you could want. But especially the Mexican food. Best in the country.  2) The variety. LA is made up of more than 50 distinct neighborhoods. If you're not feeling where you're at, head 5 minutes in any direction and you'll be somewhere completely different.  3) The people. Overall, they're a really warm and welcoming bunch. You can't judge an entire city based off of a couple nights out at douchey west hollywood clubs. We have our a-holes, just like any city. But they are a minority.  4) The weather. I used to think this was the lamest fucking reason to move somewhere…until I moved here. It's difficult to comprehend how much having temperate, sunny weather for most of the year improves your quality of life until you experience it for a while.  5) The geography. Beaches, mountains, huge parks, urban centers all within a one hour drive.  6) Live music here is insane. Every act on tour stops through here, and our venues are amazing.  7) I could keep going with this list all day, but I'll stop for now with the industry. Editors make a living all across the country, but this really is the top of the mountain. If you want to get to the top of the game, you really need to be here. Or be here for long enough that you've established yourself and have the clout to insist on working from somewhere else.  Anywho, gotta get back to work. I just love this place and get pretty passionate about defending it. Good luck to ya, wherever you end up."

editors,396ec9,BoosMyller,0,Tue Jun 9 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"There are some decent areas but overall LA sucks, though everyone has different tastes and opinons. I guess if I enjoyed spending half my life in traffic and had a salary allowing me to live comfortably on the west side, I'd say it's a decent place to live... but great is kind of a stretch.

You get what you seek, and once you've found the people you like, the places you enjoy, and the area you prefer, it's the same as every city.  If you work west side and live west side, then you're hanging out west side with west side friends. That's my experience anyway.   I'd say New York is far more of a scene.  It has to be if living in a shoebox is going to be worth it.  Listening to people explain why they love NY feels a bit like listening to an abused spouse justify why they're still married.    I own a house with a yard over the hill, have space to spread out, work on construction projects and work in commercial post. I'll admit I assumed I'd be living in an apartment my entire life after coming from NY. I never expected to have a garage!  I could have a ton more space in Texas(Austin!) or Oregon or Denver, but I like the balance in LA of having a access to a larger pool of creative talent.   Being from NJ I was a typical ""I hate LA, NY rules"" person. It took me 10 years to realize I was being a cliche. Especially on trips back to NYC during one of it's two seasons:  Garbage Smell season and Freezing Dirty Snow season.   (I'm partly joking, I would still say NY is the greatest city in the world. Just not the place to spend your life... Unlike other major cities, NYC will remove you one day regardless of what you have to say about it.)"

That said I'd say you're in the minority living on the west side, hanging out on the west side, etc. Most transplants looking to break into the LA scene get stuck in the valley for years.  I do remember going back to NYC 7ish years ago (I can't really tolerate being there for more than a long weekend anymore though) and thinking I was living cheap when I found out a couple friends living in the city were paying almost 4k for a small and shitty 2 bedroom. Small being a modest description. I think the one thing NYC really has going for it that LA can't match is the ability to work in the city and live outside it. Sure you could live in OC and take the train into LA 5 days a week but it's nowhere near as practical... and it's probably more expensive."

Although I did do the math and it ends up being about the same between Metro cards and NJT monthlies.  My brain almost melted when I saw how much the price has gone up in 10 years.   I also think Uber and Lyft have transformed this city a bit for socializing.  I don't mind going out and getting drinks like I used to.   But sitting in a car blows. No two ways about it.  Now if autonomous cars become a thing....  oh baby this city becomes amazing.

editors,395ucf,Kichigai,3,Tue Jun 9 15:02:39 2015 UTC,"Avid has been in the live graphcis space for a while now.  I think this is more of an update.    Avid is pretty much just a hardware company that buys all their software (Interplay, Media Composer, Pro Tools, etc)."
editors,395ucf,agent42b,2,Tue Jun 9 15:28:37 2015 UTC,"Deko has been around a long time, but Orad brings a lot more into the fold than Deko offers. They've got a big focus on graphics enhancements for sports (slow-mo replay, ball tracking, drawing lines of scrimmage and down distances) and news (interactive ""VJ"" elements) plus switchers, automation, video walls, virtual sets, and 3D graphics. This is all stuff outside of Avid's current sphere of influence.  And honestly I think for some of this stuff Avid is trying to get out of the hardware industry. The new DNxIO box is basically just an UltraStudio with a new label on it. They pushed Media Composer software licenses and OpenIO pretty aggressively too.  I think for a lot of stuff, especially in the live world, they'll have to keep a hand in the hardware game, but I think that ultimately they want to distance themselves from gear in the post world."
editors,395ucf,Kichigai,-1,Tue Jun 9 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"um, no."
editors,395ucf,doublesecretprobatio,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:31:10 2015 UTC,"That seems to be Orad's strength on the surface.  Maybe Avid's decided they can't develop their own products as easily as integrating acquisitions (think Blackmagic DNxHR, although I know Avid didn't buy Blackmagic). Maybe the iFind and Orbit are the new Interplay and ISIS? Only time will tell.  What's most interesting to me is how Orad seems to be entirely video focused while Avid has been very heavily promoting ProTools for the past 6-12 months."
editors,395ucf,Kichigai,2,Tue Jun 9 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"I dunno if iFind and Orbit will hang around. Most of Orad's gear already handles MXF OpAtom, so it's kind of redundant, and given that Avid just killed Unity not that long ago I'm not sure they feel like killing ISIS and screwing everyone who just bought new gear.  I think Avid wanted all the sports and news production stuff. It's all tech that would take them several years to develop, and it's all stuff they have no experience in. Buy the talent, buy the product, eliminate any redundancies and start bringing the new kit into the fold with the old stuff. It's what they did with Pro Tools. So I'd predict that the next round of updates for Orad products will start to feature some integration with News Cutter and ISIS. The technical core for DNxHD and OpAtom is already there.  As far as why Avid didn't buy Blackmagic I think it's because they don't want to be that deep in the hardware game. OpenIO was a game changer, and being able to go software-only brought Avid into closer competition with Adobe and Apple, since it reduced the costs of switching. And the DNxIO is basically just an UltraStudio.  I don't think they'll ever be entirely out of the hardware business, but I think they'd rather just be licensing kit and building things with off the shelf hardware rather than doing it all in-house.   But let's say they want to stay in the hardware biz, I don't think BMD is the direction Avid wants to go. You've got the I/O boards and whatnot, but BMD also makes format converters, film scanners, routers, scopes, monitors and cameras. While they might be interested in things like the switcher and the disk recorders, I don't know if Avid wants all the rest of the baggage.   The camera biz is getting cutthroat, and BMD has a reputation on being cheaper to own than its competitors (like AJA), which isn't Avid's bag. They're almost like Apple in this realm: more expensive, but with a reputation of consistently providing a premium product that justifies that price. Putting the two together like that doesn't seem like a good fit for me."

editors,3989v4,Ohy2,2,Tue Jun 9 23:43:04 2015 UTC,"So a lot of times, platforms that are great for DVD authoring is pretty bad at compression (looking at you, Toast), so the best course of action is to usually transcode into mpeg 2 (because even mpeg 4 is too high quality for non-Blu Ray) and then use a second platform to burn it onto the DVD. There are a lot of different ways to get from A to B in this case, though my normal course of action is to re-export from the platform I'm using--I think most editing platforms have a DVD preset anyways--and then use Toast to put it onto the DVD itself."

editors,3989v4,Kichigai,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:34:47 2015 UTC,Premiere has a preset to export for DVD - does this not produce a good quality file?  Is it Roxio which is then taking this file and turning it into garbage? Are there any settings in Roxio to adjust the quality of the burn or to not do any encoding and just use the encodes you supply from premiere (mpeg2)?
editors,3989v4,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:23:25 2015 UTC,"What's the length of your project? A dual-layer DVD gets you 8.5GB/7.92GiB to work with. DVD spec says a maximum of 9MibPS for combined audio, video, and subtitles. So let's assume a stereo AC3 audio track at 192KibPS. For safety and compatibility sake I don't take video about 8MibPS.  Now, things get a bit goofy because Apple has switched most of its numbers over to using base-10 math, but all the DVD specifications are written in base-2, so keep a tool like Wolfram Alpha handy to ensure you don't accidentally exceed specifications. (Side note: does anyone know which tools are using base-2 and which are using base-10? I think only Apple has switched over)  Keeping that in mind, a dual-layer DVD has enough space for 2 hours and 12 minutes of audio and video at maximum video quality. If your project is longer then you'll have to start making adjustments.  To produce the video use a high quality encoder. ffmpeg and Compressor do a good job, but I wouldn't discount Squeeze or Adobe's products either. Set your maximum bitrate to 8MbPS, and (this is very important) use 2-pass encoding. You may also want to change your GOP size. If you've got nothing but low-motion and talking heads, using a long GOP might be preferable. Fast-motion/high action video, though, that's very cutty, should probably get a lower GOP. Note that lower GOPs allow fast moving scenes to look better, but reduce overall compressional efficiency, meaning over the course of a second you're using more data to describe the video than you might otherwise need, and thus it might not look quite as good (though you might not notice it with your eyes alone)."

I see two options: get a crapload of drives from OWC or G-Tech (avoid the Minis, they're crap) or someone and just dupe them over ASAP. Organize the data later, since he's taking the drives with him we don't want to waste time. I'd order a couple extra and start sorting data by project. If you go with OWC gear, might be worth pricing out if you're cheaper off buying empty enclosures and getting WD Blacks or Hitachi Deskstars off Amazon or whatever.  Or get yourself a big-ass RAID array of some kind (but this ain't going to be cheap). A proper SAN is probably too expensive for this, even though it would be the absolute best solution. A NAS, unless you have plans to use it as a backup target (which, actually, is a good idea) or central repository of documents, would be useless for editing off of later (unless, maybe, if you got one from Small Tree, that might work but I hear mixed stories) and therefore might not be a good idea. That leaves DAS (Direct Attached Storage; a box plugged directly into your computer) which would be cheaper and faster, but would lock your data to being used with only one computer at a time (and how often do you need 16+TB on one computer?).  You're going to want at least a 6-bay array, capable of RAID5, RAID6, RAID10, and/or RAID50. With 4TB disks you can easily hit 16TB, but with those larger disks your recovery time from drive failure goes up, and so does the risk of multiple drive failure, so I'd recommend operating in 6, 10 or 50 mode.  Now let's talk interfaces: for moving this much data I wouldn't accept any piece of hardware that isn't capable of USB3, eSATA, Thunderbolt, GigE (for a NAS; dual is better if you have an IT guy to set it up), or uses a specialized interface (e.g. Fibre Channel, InfiniBand; for DAS) otherwise it'll take you an uncomfortably long time to move all this data around.

Currently you have 12 which is crippling most of that system.  This is holding back your processors (CPUs) - they do the heavy lifting - particularly the encoding/decoding of codecs - h.264 is a very bad culprit here.   From a workflow POV, if you had your system converting everything to a post codec (say, the night before) that'd make sure everything was going as fast as possible. Going to/from codecs like h.264 are eating your processors.  Storage: I'd like you to have an SSD to boot from and small SSD to set as your caches.  Your system has enough storage - but SSDs would really help boot time and caching.  GPU That Video card is also killing you. I'd get an nVIDIA card like the Titan X. Something with a bunch of cores and minimum 2-3 GB of GPU ram.  The Mercury Playback Engine - which does scaling and all the accelerated effects, really needs a good GPU - and this can cause 5-10x slower outputs. Three way CC, Lumetri and Curves all benefit from the GPU - and your rMBP has it, where this system doesn't.  Workflow part II Last, I'll mention not to use ""Maximum render quality"" nor ""Maximum bit depth"". The first is meant for upscaling/downscaling of footage and the 2nd is solely beneficial when you're working in 10 bit+ workflows."

The stop-start machine could be networked to your shared storage and edit stations, while the uninterrupted recording would be safe on a separate drive/ server.  I've heard good things about Small Tree for portable networked storage.  On this sort of set up, you may actually want to look into a switcher, especially one that would handle all four camera streams' encoding. Might be slightly more effective than having each camera on a dedicated encode box.  Lastly, I've never used Premiere's ability to edit growing files; might be worth checking out."

Would switcher be the right term for it? I thought those just redirected feeds (last time I used a switcher was TV studio class a decade ago, so maybe they can encode as well). I'm looking for a box that can take multiple feeds, encode them to something friendly like DNX and dump them on the NAS for editing, but preferably segmented so I could access them without needing to stop recording.

editors,3940tp,greenysmac,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:14:17 2015 UTC,We used to use an app called Picture Ready with FCP 7 which allowed the editing of a live recorded QuickTime. I think there is something for FCPX called Movie Recorder (dumb name) or something like that!
editors,3948fo,LetItRun,5,Tue Jun 9 03:38:06 2015 UTC,"Problem was, they were all offline and needed relinking   OK, that's not so bad. A major screw up on their part (I'd never let a disk leave the building like that), but nothing unfixable.   I should note that the original source files vary in resolution - most are 4K, some are 1080p, and a couple are even 720x486. Most are [supposed to be] AMA linked, though are just directly linked.   What do you mean ""directly linked""? You mean natively ingested (as opposed to AMA)? This will get messy, but not impossible.   When I try to relink these files to their original source material found on the external drive, even when their filenames match, it just doesn't work. I get error messages saying the source files on the drive don't match the project (which is 1080p and 23.976fps, as per my boss' request).   Are you relinking at ""any quality""? Do the proxies match the original source format? Or at least frame rate? If they don't match the frame rate you will have to do some overcutting, otherwise this could work out in a not totally awful way.   So my question is: how can you relink to the highest-res (original) source files in MC8 when they're all offline (especially 4K footage)?   Do you have the original bins that this footage was AMA'd in? If all the footage was transcoded in Avid, you might have a glimmer of hope.  First, make a Video Mixdown of your sequence. Quality is unimportant, DNxHD 36, H.264 proxy, whatever. We don't care, this will never see the light of day.  Second, ""offline"" all your Avid native media (just rename Avid MediaFiles to Not Avid MediaFiles or something). Then make sure either your original source AMA bins are all online (and open on the screen) or make a new bin and AMA to them.  From there relink your sequence to ""Any"" video resolution, enabling all options for source or reference, by file name, ignoring case sensitivity, etc. Hopefully that should get you almost all the way here.  After that you fix your Avid MediaFiles to bring online anything that is only available as native media (rename it again). The rest of your sequence should click on, and assuming they gave you full res of any relevant native media, boom.  You might need to do some fixing, but this is where that mixdown comes into play. Make a new video track in your sequence, drop the mixdown on top, invert it, drop the opacity to 50%, and start scanning through your sequence. Everything that isn't flat grey is stuff you'll need to adjust. Things might be out of alignment by a frame or two, or maybe some finessing to the framing, but that should be it."

I also had a potential epiphany for at least why the 4K footage wasn't AMA relinking. It was shot on a Sony FS7, which I now see requires a separate plugin that MC8 doesn't have built into it, and which my boss didn't have yet. If I install it, in theory, I should be able to reconnect to all the original 4K footage, right?"

Craigslist is a good starting point. I for one do interview styles professionally and I could take a look at it if you'd like and give you an estimate. Hiring a company would be overly expensive as they generally do contracts. If you are looking for an editor I imagine the rate being 500-2k depending on who you hire. Pm me if you need anything else. Good luck."

editors,390wgt,agent42b,3,Mon Jun 8 13:30:20 2015 UTC,From the keyboard? You can't.  You can use a modifier key (shift? Command? Press them until you find the right combo) to select multiple points.

In your keyboard shortcuts, search for ""Select nearest,"" and map any of the ""Select Nearest Edit Point as...[roll/ripple/trim]"" as you want.

Now you're pretty much set up. Park your playhead on or near the first edit point/s which you'd like to select and target your track/s. Use your new ""Select Nearest Edit Point as…"" keyboard command to make the first selection. Now hold down SHIFT and hit your up and down arrows to jump to the next edit point. Reassign you track selectors if necessary and use your ""Select Nearest Edit Point as…"" again to select the new edit point in addition to your existing selection."

Editing in Premiere is slow due to the AdobeQT32Sever having to process the footage for playback.   Doing some research, it seems the best way to combat this is to edit in another codec such as ProRes yet when I jumped on my mac to convert, I only saw ProRes under quicktime, so surely this will still have the same low performance?  So my question is, whats the best codec to edit on for premiere pro on a PC and how best to get to that codec?"
editors,390wgt,FuzeDzn,4,Mon Jun 8 15:03:23 2015 UTC,"The problem is not the AdobeQT32Server (well, it does slow things a bit, but that is not the majority issue).  The problem is the H264 codec.    Convert to Prores and everything will be much faster."

Not long ago I had computer issues, and sent it in for repair(MAC). When it came back everything worked fine, but a couple of programs lost their registration. One of those is AVID MC. I have been unable to find any way to get it back working, or to contact AVID in any way.  I had had been using it in the school I work at for school projects, and teaching kids, and while that isn't a super expensive copy, I can't afford to buy MC again.

Try the following command line  ffmpeg -i /path/to/yourFile.asf -c:v prores -profile:v 0 -c:a pcm_s16le -ar 48000 /path/to/output.mov   If not then you might need access to a windows computer. From there something like Media Player Classic or even just Windows Media Player may be able to convert the audio into some usable intermediate file before you attempt to encode ProRes.
editors,38xspl,kissmyrobot,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:40:12 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks for the tip. I thought ffmpeg might be able to do it. I actually just used handbrake to convert to MP4, but it couldn't read the audio stream.   Ugghh, I need a course on ffmpeg."
editors,38xspl,Kichigai,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:57:50 2015 UTC,"FYI, prores_ks is considered to be better than prores at this stage in the game. However given the source footage, the difference in this case should be unnoticeable.  But otherwise, oh hell yeah ffmpeg can handle that file. Another possibility would have been a simple pass-through/audio conversion pass   ffmpeg -i (file).asf -c:v copy -c:a aac (output).mp4   The input is DivX 5, which is just MPEG-4 Part 2, so that should translate cleanly, and you could either convert the audio to AAC for an MP4 container, or swap that out for an MOV container and do -c:a copy to maintain audio fidelity, which might be preferable at least as a first step, because that file looks really funky.  I mean, look at its specs. Total file size is 2.62MiB, but the video stream clocks in at 34.9 GiB. Looks like it could be a streaming video source, and the ASF is just pointing to the streams. If it were me I'd pull down the stream first, and then modify it."

True, but I figured it wouldn't be worth the added time for this quality input. It's good to point out for others.  The file is unusually small but it's also a small frame and a very low bitrate for both audio and video. It's ASX that were Windows Media Playlist/Streaming files.  The one thing that baffles me is the audio is 4-bit. I wouldn't be surprised if that trips up VLC and, possibly, ffmpeg."

Every single job I've gotten has been through word of mouth eg: producer who enjoyed working with me has a new show,  trusts me and dials me up,  or an editor who I worked with is on something and would prefer my support and gets my name on the list.   That's often  followed by some freelance that leads to some kind of permalance.   That or I've been getting lucky.   I didn't write all that to share my story but I'm going to say maybe try and reach out to some people you've worked with and explain your situation and see if they can help you out.     I'm in the NY market and I often see this pattern on a show,  a few freelancers are being rotated in,  one or two stick out,  and producers mention they like them,  they often drop a few real homerun edits out and make everyone's life easier,  and when someone leaves they're the first one to get a call.   The thing is because most post supervisors I've meet really want to make sure they maintain their current level of quality.   My advice  again would be to reach out to your contacts,  still keep your reel tight,  look for freelance that you feel could have potential to grow into more,  and try and hit it out of the park when you get a chance,  but at the same time learning how the current group operates and adapting your style to that.   TLDR: reach out to some people you've worked with,  and when you get the chance knock it out of the park.  You sound like you know the deal,  and need an opportunity to shine."

If you have the ability to push in post you could try showing the same action scaling up on the beat.

The method they used works well for footage with no dialogue or big movements and is easy to do (I've used in my self a few times). They have the clip running forward, then the have the same clip running backward which means you can't see any jump when moving into the reversed footage. You can repeat this going forward and back as many times as you like. Works great with GVs and the like, horrible if you want to extend a shot of someone talking or running across frame."

The difference that pushes things nvidia's direction is simply that you can use CUDA more than you can use OpenCL. Did you look at the link in my previous post? There are features and entire applications that are only available if you have a CUDA card.  Even if performance is neck-and-neck it's worth going nvidia for the times that CUDA is the only option."

editors,38r1il,seventhward,8,Sat Jun 6 02:45:17 2015 UTC,"Editing isn't the problem, its the business. It shows you how much people like to edit since they put up with a lot of shit that comes their way and a lot of tough asks that can be borderline illegal. Deadline orientated creative jobs can be very demanding depending where you sit on the food chain. I work for a design agency, and our clients are very corporate orientated and usually place strict deadlines based on pre-determined budgets rather than what is actually fully needed to take the project to its fullest potential. This means that sometimes you have to just do what the budget dictates, rather than go all out on something, which can be disheartening for a lot of people who are passionate about what they do. They also expect you to deliver something that is top quality, for a medium quality price, which can also be quite the challenge depending on the asks and your client relationship. Baiting and switching is also common, where they brief you on a project of a certain scope, and then constantly add stuff to it while you are working on it to get more bang for the buck. Its a shady maneuver as it puts the editor in a position to say no and possibly lose the project, or just try to manage it as best as possible, which is what most do.  So its largely up to you, if you really enjoy it, you will make it work. Sometimes that means you will be put in tough positions where it might make you feel differently about what you do, but in the end of the day, its all your choice. If you have cool clients, you are golden.  Make sure you get more out of your projects than just money."

editors,38r1il,Ant_Boys,17,Sat Jun 6 10:52:44 2015 UTC,"Throwaway account.  I used to LOVE editing, and all aspects of filmmaking.  Now I don't.  My reasons are personal, but I'll share my story.    I am not famous, but I've won festival awards for directing, editing, and even composing soundtracks for one of my movies.  I settled into editing eventually.  Loved it.  More stable hours than working on set.  Better environment... felt more ""grown up"" if you know what I mean: a nice office, people in suits working elsewhere alongside you, etc.    Eventually I developed back, shoulder and wrist pain.  Not the easy carpel-tunnel stuff that medicine can fix, but a combo of nerve issues.  It's a nightmare but I fought through it, constantly.    Then came the terrible working hours.  You begin to feel like a zombie and you dread knowing that, no matter what milestone you hit, you will leave feeling as if you haven't done enough.  Never mind, I carried on.  I even got a huge payout from a lawsuit involving my studio (6 months of unpaid overtime...suddenly they cut me a check ... all because they were battling in court and needed to rack up as many expenses as possible to make their claim seem legit).  Anyway.... that's when the back/wrist issues really become unstoppable -- 14 hours/day 6 or sometimes 7 days a week, for 6 months straight.    Despite this, I've continued to work my up the ladder.  I have a very enviable full-time salary position at a large TV Network.  True, I don't cut feature films but in my opinion this is the next best thing: not reality TV, but big budget promos, a well funded enterprise both technologically and people-wise.  Even comes with paid vacation, paid-physio for my wrist issues ... hell, they are even going to top me up at 70% for when I go on parental-leave next year.  Dream job, right?   Well ... I cannot wait to go back to school and leave this industry.  I day-dream about it constantly.  It's true that my pain is the worst of it.... but I also get so tired of producers spending 5 hours shooting something, 2 hours writing a script, and then having me spend several days editing it to death only to still have them come back and annoying want to change stuff and still get most of the credit.  I guess I've become a little bitter at the power-alignment of editors (hint: we're near the bottom).  True, we carry more weight than many positions on set .. but in our world all we see is directors, producers, and executives: that is our world, and in that world we are on the bottom.  Maybe it reveals a negative side about my personality but honestly, yeah, it's starting to bother me.    I've thought about moving ranks into feature films, and some of my friends have ... but they are no more pleased than I am.  I am in my mid thirties, the time when people are starting to have families and perhaps bought their first house (I fall into this statistic) and there is a massive exodus out of the industry in this age bracket and people realize ""wtf, I can make WAY more money or at least have a WAY better lifestyle doing something else.""  And so it is.  One of best friends, even through film school, is thinking of quitting the biz.  Remember that studio lawsuit I spoke about earlier?  Even the studio manager (ie. my former boss) is going back to school.  We both have kids that are a few months old, so we meet up (this is the excuse, at least) to have the babies interact, while we talk and laugh about how crappy our industry is and compare our ""back-to-school"" plans -- it's hilarious.    But the scariest thing about it?  Because of my day job at a major network, owned by a cable company that runs half the networks in the country... I am basically a top-tier promo/sizzle editor because of my contacts.  Basically if you want a TV show... you need to pitch it to an executive, somebody who you may never be able to meet because you just aren't high-up enough in the industry.  Well guess what?  I work with those people, and talk to them regularly.  It's a huge ""in"" to have me editing your TV show trailer/pilot/etc because I carry some clout my working down the hall.  So yeah, I guess you could say I exploit this enviable position because I get lots of freelance producers asking me to edit their ""you've got no chance in hell of getting this"" sizzle reel for their upcoming reality TV show.  You know who my biggest freelance clients are?  Washed-up producers ...always the same story: just trying to get one last show so that they can ""retire.""  These are people in their 50s, tired and disgruntled.  They all tell me the same story, ""if I had only done something else with my life...""  There are seas of unemployed 50-something television workers, whether producers, creative-directors, whatever top-tier studio positions you can think of that fall into the realm of content production.  The really high up people (The MBAs, the finance people, etc) they do just fine, but to them this is not about creating film/tv it's just an enterprise like anything else.    Now don't get me wrong: when I finish school I may end up returning to Film/TV: it's hard imagining doing anything else.  But from my perspective, editing itself has become too marginalized in the over all process, despite the fact that it's technically growing in the amount of work it's responsible for.  I don't want to be in my late 50s and hit that wall -- I'd rather be the guy with the MBA who's a little more confident in those remaining years (not that the MBA automatically guarantees that, but you get what I mean).    So... when I woke up this morning and decided to check reddit on my phone... my wrist hurt even as I scrolled through the posts and found yours.  I went downstairs, put on my wrist brace just so I could type this without too much pain.    OK there's my rant."
editors,38r1il,theeditram,3,Sat Jun 6 12:20:15 2015 UTC,"Really appreciate the honesty. I'm an editor in my mid-twenties experiencing a lot of what you've described here. I moved across the country with no job or contacts and have worked my way up the ladder onto bigger name productions. These ""bigger"" productions have been the worst culprits of abuse against the post production crew. On the last project it was expected that everyone stay as late as the director did which sometimes constituted in excess of 16 hours days for some employee's. The word overtime was never spoken as it was just expected that ""everyone was passionate about completing the project"". I refused to work these crazy hours and would leave at the end of my 10-12 hour day and believe I was prematurely released from the production because of this decision.   I moved on to the next project as an AE with the promise of working with a well established editor. After a few weeks of prep work it was decided that I would edit the rough cut on my own, now we are nearing final cut and I have still never met the original lead editor. When I brought up that I deserved more money since I now had the responsibility of two positions I was told there was nothing more in the budget and I could either continue at my current rate or walk. Without anything to fall back on I had no choice but to continue on with the job.   The worst part was having to work with an extremely negative/aggressive producer sitting over my shoulder every day literally wanting a hand in every single cut. I believe this excessive stress contributed to some debilitating lower back pain that literally left me unable to lift myself up from a seated position without excruciating pain. Weeks later I'm still struggling to feel normal.  I often ask myself if this is really what I want to do with the rest of my life? I love editing, I wouldn't have moved into this profession otherwise but I'm beginning to believe that entertainment culture is a disease that eats you from the inside out. I can't count the amount of time that I have heard ""you just need to pay your dues"" or ""this is just what everyone puts up with"". Seeing your post does not make me hopeful for a future in this profession, but I appreciate that it may save me a whole lot of trouble."

Don't get me wrong -- you will find productinos with great managers and great environments, but ultimately you'll find that everything is cyclical, just like the content we create.  It is usually just a matter of time until the same problems rear their head again.  How many times can the novelty of a ""new"" show keep you interested, for the rest of your working life?

editors,38r1il,DickStatkus,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:50:12 2015 UTC,"I love editing, I love crafting a story and making a bunch of disjointed footage come to life with a coherent narrative. I love it when someone brings me a bunch of footage and says ""we shot this but we don't know how to bring it together"" and through my craft and expertise  and creativity I can make something awesome. It's an awesome way to make a living. That said, there are two things about the current state of editing that sometimes cause me to hate my career:  1- generalisation. I'm an editor, it's what I started out doing, it's what I love. I hate the fact that, especially at the budget end of things, we are expected to do the job of about 4 different people. I'm ok at After Effects, but I don't enjoy it. I'm ok at Resolve, but I don't enjoy it. I'm ok in Photoshop, but I don't enjoy it. If you're working at low budgets clients expect you to be editor, motion graphics designer, sound mixer and colourist all in one. I don't want to do all of that stuff, I just want to edit.   2-clients. I started in the industry almost 20 years ago and it seems like these days clients have less money but want more creative control. I hate, hate, hate taking creative input from non-creative people and as I get older I find myself giving less of a fuck about the finished project. When I was younger I would have fought tooth and nail if I thought a client was wrecking a project with their input, now I just shrug and say ""yeah, comic sans is totally the way to go"" or ""no problem, we can definitely use that ukulele version of Whole Lotta Loving that your nephew recorded on his iPhone, sure!""  Don't mean to put you off, OP. Yes, there are things about editing that we all find difficult, but I doubt there's a job or an industry that you can't say that about. If it's what you want to do, go for it. You will have some amazing times and work with some amazing people, creating amazing things that people love. Is it sometimes difficult or annoying? Sure, but it's worth it."

I'll bitch about my job, sure, but in the end the results are so much more rewarding (I'm not one of those ""I want to see my name in lights"" people, but seeing my name in a broadcast network show does give me a tingle) and so much more intuitive to me that I can't imagine doing anything else.  I'm surrounded by people who are working in the same mindset as I am. They've seen the same ugly sides of clients as I have. Some of them have even done the work I'm doing. I mean, I'm pretty much the definition of a junior team member, but hell, the people I work with have been there too, and there are very few jobs that I've worked (and I've done a decent variety of them) where the whole company has such a similar mindset.  I mean, we'll clash over methodology, we'll clash over workflows, we'll clash over politics, but that's all minutia. We're still all aiming for (more or less) the same goals, it's just questions about the path we'll have to take.  Though I'll be the first to admit my experience may be atypical."

I absolutely love being able to sit down and tell stories with video and get compensated very well for it.   Sometimes it feels like I'm cheating the system or something.   I also get editor guilt because getting to where I am now took a lot of work, but I know some smart and lucky situations put me in the right place to excel.  People would be envious of the spot I'm in yet there's a big part of me that is approaching an epic level of burnout.   It's no surprise that so many big shows take nice long break during the summer and things like that,  because I'd just crack.     The downside is I'm just about 12 years into this business and my anxiety hasn't improved,  I sleep bad hours,  and feel extremely burnt out.  Now I'm trying to start a family and I'm trying to crack the code on how to build a kind of balance between this career and that.   My wrists are also shot, and my eyes are always killing me.     I still love it,  it's really the one thing in life I'm truly good at and knowing I've contributed to building a style and look for to some extremely successful shows,  as well as some flops,  has been so rewarding.  Not to mention some great friends.   But the burnout, it's real,  and I think worse if you tend to be a hyper creative person.  The nonstop day to day micro problem solving has burned me to a crisp.  I've been saving a lot more lately so I can take a big break for a while and just re align myself.   There's  no free lunch as far as I'm concerned and I'm damn happy I am where I am,  I'm just tired all the time now."

editors,38r1il,CM90,0,Sat Jun 6 17:06:49 2015 UTC,"I'm an editor who graduated from film school three years ago. Started making web commercials as a shooter/editor, got my first network AE gigs (which involved a lot of night work FYI), and now I work as an editor on ""documentary""/reality TV shows.   Editing has given me a great life. I make more than anyone my age (and most people my parents' age) and get to be creative all day. But the job itself can also be HARD -- you'll sometimes have to edit a full half hour show in a week or two. You're always solving very difficult problems using music, sound design, and visual tricks. Sometimes the footage is really bad and virtually impossible to turn into a good show. Occasionally this exacerbates me, but mostly I get off on the challenge. It's a really cool responsibility -- you're essentially creating the show from pieces that dozens of people have entrusted you with.   The deadlines can fucking suck, and the hours can run long. Producers will sometimes give you notes to address at the end of the day, and you'll have to keep working until it's done. When I'm not dealing with a deadline though, I usually work a 9-10 hour day.   Also, freelancing can be really scary. Sometimes you'll go weeks or months without work, even if you have decent credits and a few years of experience. On sites like Staffmeup, I'll sometimes compete with over a hundred people for each job. But if you live in LA or NY, you'll still be able to support yourself comfortably if you work 2/3 of the year.   My main word of advice is to really focus on interning on the type of shows (or movies) you're passionate about. Editing is a sweet job, but it can get depressing when 90% of the time your editing skills are ultimately used to create a dumb piece of shit reality show."

After the third time they sent the final version back with a million and one changes I asked them to approve all the changes in the script and captions and sign off on them before I make any changes to the video. They have now sent it back two more times with changes. I've made those changes and have now sent it back a sixth time for approval. Each time between exchanges this person has taken a month to send back changes or to even email me back at all, so a project that was supposed to take a couple months, a few hours at a time, has now taken a year.  It's well beyond budget at this point. Each time I rewrite the script with them, they then send it back with changes. They've made the same damn changes five times. For example changing an acronym from one with periods in between to no periods in between that appears twenty six times throughout the captioned video (it'll appear silently on screens throughout the business) or changing voice overs for the online version from one phrasing to another and then back again to the old phrasing.  I'm about to rip my hair out. Trying to make the client happy but holy shit. I went over their head to their boss this past week and said that I need him to approve the script and finalize it because we cannot change it again at this point.  Finally, just today I received the final script and sign off. I told them no changes after this point unless it's absolutely my fault or they need to provide another thousand in budget to cover all of the extra time spent on this project.

The shoot was a clusterfuck, since our producer had only acquired two 2tb drives, and we had to handle enormous footage. We had individual takes that were 50gb EACH.

For that matter, I doubt FCP7 even really knows what to do with an MKV file  Is VLC your only option? VLC is not very good for transcoding, in my opinion. I would suggest checking out Perian which looks like it might offer support for Compressor or QuickTime Pro to work with MKV wrapped files. Or, if you don't have those, MPEG Streamclip is an opensource transcoder that works pretty well (even that will still need Perian to work though)  MKVs can be pretty tough to work with. Good luck!  EDIT: Don't use Perian :) That was just the first thing that came up when I was hunting for options. ffmpeg is a much better choice"
editors,38qcv6,aflocka,2,Fri Jun 5 23:52:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything here, except that using Perian is a very bad idea™. It hasn't been updated in three years and the way it mucks about with QuickTime can break a lot of stuff in software that depends on QT7+ (like FP7).  A much smarter way of dealing with the footage is to just deal with ffmpeg. Most likely the video data in the MKV is H.264, which can be passed through without transcoding (though going to ProRes is still highly recommended for FCP7, which ffmpeg can do), and the audio can be dealt with on a case by case basis.

I watched the file then and it was very strange. For some reason the film was super sped up, but the entire film was converted--due to the fact that it was so fast the entire movie lasted less than two minutes. The remaining 40 minutes that had supposedly rendered was just black.  I did a few more test runs all to the same effect. In the conversion preview window it shows up exactly how the file played--super fast, followed by blackness.   Any idea on why that is or how to fix it?

I feel like staff rates are probably a little lower for editors than a lot of locations (but at my company we have good benefits).  I just made the jump from AE to Editor at the same company, so there's a good chance I could make a little more elsewhere (even locally), but I like working here and they've taken good care of me.  We've had editors move here from LA and Chicago and the thing they always say is that those of us who have only worked in Knoxville don't get how good we have it as far as working environments and work/life balance go.  I can't speak to how true that actually is, but I work 40 hour weeks 9-5ish so I imagine there's a lot of truth there.

The place overall was cool, but the show was a complete nightmare, one of the worst I've ever worked on. All the editors were so miserable, but had to all stay because there because there really wasn't much work down there. In LA or NYC you can quit a gig a be on a new job next week."

I feel like I could only ever live in NYC or LA because of the competitive nature of the business, but there's gotta be pockets of studios doing well in the other cities mentioned here.

I know a few video post houses also have audio staff here, such as Henninger and IMG. If you'll suffer a leap, it seems to me that there's just gotta be a lot of post stuff going on for audio if there's this much for video. Maybe give a query to one of the organizations I've listed and they can put you in contact with someone a little more tapped into the audio post scene out here. Hope this helps!"

editors,38j6mz,Solid_Bob,3,Thu Jun 4 15:59:31 2015 UTC,"Having read your other comments, here's my understanding: You're being paid per video, so even though you're being asked to do more videos, you're being paid more to do those videos. Your concern seems to be that you're being given less time to do it. You also said that you can do 4-6 videos in an hour. So at a max that's ~18 hours of work for a week turnaround. That doesn't sound too bad. Like, at all. Even double that doesn't sound too bad.  Any way I look at it, from the information you've provided, it seems to me like you're making out pretty good. Even if you don't have the time during the week to get all this done, you said that it's mostly trimming videos and dropping them in templates. Why couldn't you find someone else to help you with that workload? Seems pretty basic, and you can pay them at a lower rate than you receive so you get a cut of their work. That's not being dishonest, that's actually how businesses get started and grow.  On top of that, I think three months is too soon to try to renegotiate a rate.  So it goes without saying that I don't recommend asking for more money. I don't think you're being taken advantage of at all. In fact, I'd wager that asking for more money will 100% come across as greedy to your client.  Frankly, I'd love to have your problem. If you want to unload that client, please send them my way ;)"

He was my first client as a freelancer, and I still work for him despite now getting freelance jobs in TV which pay way more.  I called him recently and told him I'd have to increase my rates with him due to the demand of other jobs I've been getting (which pay much more) and I still cut him a deal and bill him less than my other clients, but he was open to the negotiation.  If you're doing double the work with the same timeframe, it isn't fair and that's not what you agreed upon. Reach out to them, and tell them that due to the increased workload you will need to bill them according to the amount of work, not the turnaround time.  You said yourself it's ""price per video"" - multiply that price by 70.  Also what the hell are you doing that you're doing 70 videos in a one week turnaround?"
editors,38j6mz,mikefightmaster,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:38:31 2015 UTC,"I might have not correctly phrased the price per video. Currently, I'm being paid $30 per video. So 40 videos = $1200, 70 videos = $2100.   I am being paid more, but the time frame has remained the same and I feel that's a ton of work for 1 week. I could see the client coming back and saying: ""Well we are paying you more"", but its not the same as buying 10 apples and then 100 apples from the store.   Our rapport is good, and we are on good foundation, but I dont want to ruin constant work. I also dont want to be taken advantage of.   70 videos are doable. They are testimonial/interview videos. I can knock out roughly 4-6 in an hour. They're all the same and I have a method. It's just cutting the footage and dropping them into the template timeline."
editors,38j6mz,Bane_and_Boon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:52:35 2015 UTC,"Hmm, perhaps due to it being double the work you could negotiate a higher rate per video - since 40 in that timeframe is your standard, you could argue that doing double in the same timeframe is a ""rush"" perhaps and it will be a premium.  If you approach your client respectfully, and you have that ongoing rapport with them, then they may see your side and be open to negotiations."

There are times where you can really help out the production and be creative though. You can whip up sequences that will work better with less vfx shots and be cheaper for the production. Mockups for certain VFX shots that will drive the timing of the VFX from that point on. Making animatics in pre-production is tonnes of creative fun work, that I feel actually helps, and finds its way (however small) to the big screen.   I guess what I'm saying is yes, it is like a co-ordinator, but you still need to be an editor, and you still need to know your shit."

editors,38eee7,Rasket,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:56:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah.... hahah, it's a frustrating position. I can only speak for myself (this girl could have just sent files and thats it)  VFX companies bid on projects before they even begin filming. Storyboards are made. And VFX shots are identified. Then production starts working on strategy (what's the most cost effective way to film this?) Every VFX shot is fucking expensive, so we'd animate their already drawn storyboards so that they can see how long their VFX shots will last (the longer the shot, the more money it will cost) we can fuck around with the sequence and show them how losing a shot here or there will save them cash. We can also illustrate how to shoot the shots in a more cost effective way (if we punch in on this shot so we don't see the feet, that will save you money, because it will be easier for a compositor). We animate the sequence add sound and music and go from there. VFX editor will do that.  Now lets say we got the show, everything has been agreed upon and we're starting to receive the shots that they filmed. Before it ever gets to any artists (who are busy all the time!) we can start adding elements from the storyboards into the live action, by tracking them in in After Effects (or avid); this starts the ball rolling ""how many of this will be in this shot? How big will it be, when will it do this?"" Artists cost money, so its better for us to figure this shit out now. Then we can set it in front of someone and know what to ask them to do, instead of them figuring it out as they go.   So now the artist has their marching orders and they start rendering shots. The VFX editor cuts them into the sequence, makes sure they line up with the offline edit, and packages it up and sends it to the assistant editor, to be cut into the sequence.   The edit changes every day, so if they lose a VFX shot and an artist is still cranking out versions of a shot no longer in the cut, we lose money.   TLDR - You get to animate storyboards, and make sequences, make mockups that you think will work for VFX shots, but mostly you slog through timelines and make sure everything is okay."

In my case the option is greyed out. This should allow you to deal with ISO, White balance, etc. and actually take advantage of the RAW material within the editing software. And apparently it should be possible. And would be very handy in my particular situation. However for anyone interested: there are a few workarounds. Sony Raw Viewer (needs to export new files though). Speed Grade and Da Vinci are also good.  BUT WELL: I just would like to batch-alter it within the editing software."

I personnally prefer to detail the amount of hours and set an hourly rate. Even if I negotiated a flat fee for the whole project. But as I said in another post, it's better to try accomodate a old client and use the same flat fee than comming up with a totally new way.  I also took the habit of writing on the bill my normal (wanted/full) rate, add everything up and then, at the end after the total, substract a percentage billed as a discount.  A totally fictionnal example:   Data management: 10 hours @ 20$/h   :  200 Video Editing: 10 hours @ 100$/h : 1000 Masters output: 5 hours @ 10$/h    :    50 total: 1250 tax and whatnot: 100 grand total: 1350$ Super discount because you are my uncle and I love you: -80% (1080) discounted total: 270$   That way new clients know what you usually charge and that they are getting a discount, not  someone willing to work for cheap.

editors,38eaq2,dukenuk12,3,Wed Jun 3 17:26:19 2015 UTC,"What we do is just copy over the whole Avid MediaFiles folder to an HDD and ship that off with a copy of the project.  In your case, what I'd do is a little monkey business. Go into your Avid MediaFiles/MXF folder and make a few more folders for yourself. You should see the obligatory 1 and maybe a 2 or so. I'd rename those like 4 and 5, and then make 1, 2 and 3 with the appropriate permissions (Get Info, and give everyone read/write permissions).  Then make your DNxHD 36 media, and Avid should auto-dump those into the lowest numbered folders. Then when the time comes, copy over just those numbers, put them in the right folder structure, and test the project to make sure everything is online (easiest way is to add an Offline column to your bins).  This may be an unorthodox way of doing it, but it's worked just fine for us for the past few years. It's also considerably faster than doing a Consolidate, and when sequences start flying back and forth people won't have to relink to their copies of the Proxy material.  Bonus: if your someone complains about a problem you can easily take your full res footage offline and you can try to reproduce (and work around) the problem using the exact same media they have (ruling out the possibility that there's something wrong with the specific copies that were made during consolidation), and if their local copy is corrupt you can easily and quickly fire off just the MXF file they need with no muss and no fuss."

The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as ""pomodori"", the plural of the Italian word pomodoro for ""tomato"".  The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.    Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.

Don't forget to stretch your eye muscles as well as your other muscles. Go outside if you can. Hold a finger in front of your face as closely as you can focus it. Then find the farthest point away from you and line it up behind your finger. Change your focal length between the two, effectively doing stretches for your eye muscles. In a long edit, your eyes stay focused on the one fixed focal length and your eye muscles don't do a lot of moving. Eye exercises help you feel refreshed, and will help keep your eyesight stronger."

Content distributors.   I usually export prores and then run that file through media encoder to get my different renditions. Is there another codec (gopro cineform? h264 @ high bit rate? DVC pro? HDV?) I can export to faster?   CineForm and DNxHD should fit the bill, along with ProRes. H.264 at high bitrate will undoubtedly take a lot longer. Both DVCPro HD and HDV will reduce the overall quality of your video, as they're anamorphic formats. HDV will also take a fair while longer than DVCPro HD.   I should also mention that in this specific case the video is not going to broadcast so I don't need the killer bitrate ProRes & DNxHD provide.   You want fast, those are fast. That's part of their design philosophy: high quality and low system impact at the expense of storage.   The videos are delivering usually at 720p for Facebook and 1080p @ 10mbps for YT)   Why not just use the same for both? Facebook distributes 1080p content and its accepted specs are pretty much the same as YouTube's."

editors,388oti,poematik,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:02:59 2015 UTC,"Good, Fast, Small - pick 2.  The advantage of exporting a ProRes or DNxHD codec is that it will compress quickly (Good, Fast) and is excellent for a mastering codec. You should absolutely render in this format.  Then you can generate different compressions for different deliverables via Adobe Media Encoder your your needs.  I'd avoid using ""Use Previews"" as it uses the rendered codec (usually Iframe MPEG2 50 mbs.)  It's like going down a generation.  The Smart Rendering codec is solely for when your camera, renders & outputs all match. Probably not the case for most people.  Last, make sure you have Max quality and Max color depth off as they'll both increase your output time."

Granted you can do a movie multiple ways...some movies could play as an action movie or more of an intense drama or whatever. I personally have never cut a raider but I do edit movie promos for a network which is somewhat close. Granted the most time I ever get is 60 seconds and I have to throw in the ""tonight at 8 on _____"" so I don't get to cut proper trailers so I'm not the best person to ask. Just throwing out my 2 cents.   The approach would be about the same....watch the entire movie...sub clip your favorite parts so they're saved and write out your favorite lines...sometimes you can piece together some bytes to tell the story well without having VoiceOver or onscreen graphics to sort of fill in the spaces.   The two toughest parts to figure out are the beginning and the end...plan those out because you'll want to entice them from the beginning and have a ending payoff. Then figure out how to take care of the middle to make it make sense and flow...."
editors,388gd2,KevinTwitch,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:26:27 2015 UTC,Good tips. Do you usually start with the music and cut to it or find original music or..?
editors,388gd2,KevinTwitch,2,Wed Jun 3 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"I typically A-roll everything...meaning I will have all bytes / VO / full screen graphics sort of laid in...even if I'm going to do a fullscreen graphic of like ""IN A WORLD"" - I'll just put a temp of white text over black just to sort of get a place holder in there. So I can pretty much get the bones of the pieced together of where everything will generally be. THEN I start figuring out the music... but sometimes you could have little quick music ramps with just quick b-roll shots and things like that so you sort of slowly get a frame work. Once that framework is set then you can start having fun...because then you're hunting for the action shots, the music and things like that...which is actually the fun part because that's when it starts to take on a life of its own.  As for music...we have a number of different libraries we use that have dramatic trailer type music but they're all pay sites. If it's a popular movie like Batman...it's probably not hard to find the soundtrack to rip a song to use.   If you're really hunting for a library to use...ExtremeMusic is pretty good...might be able to find something there (or rip a track using audacity which would be very wrong and should never be done even for small personal practice projects...but Audacity could do it)."

You know where the bites are, you know the good scenes/shots, and you can probably build a story in your head.  In my Intro to Editing class in film school, the teacher offered extra credit to anything cut outside of class. I think I had just watched House of Wax and wanted to get a little faster in FCP, so I pulled the movie in and started cutting. Somehow, this has 13K views and it's possible some people think it's the real trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFPZd7Qa_XY  Regardless, find a movie you like and music you love and put them together for practice. Aim for 90 seconds, and see where it takes you. I will say, the coolest trailer I've seen these days is the Mad Max teaser, starting exactly from where this link takes you. Perfect example of cutting video to music... (though it's possible it could have been partially the other way around).  https://youtu.be/akX3Is3qBpw?t=1m37s"

You can look on Mandy and productionHub, or be a little more proactive and go to variety411 and find production houses or post houses that might need shooters or editors.  You can also go to the websites of various media companies in the area, of which there is an abundance.  In Manhattan alone, most media companies have a serious presence if not headquarters.  There's also stuff nearby- in Secaucus and Stamford, CT for instance.  It will be harder without connections, but don't let that stop you.

So I don't think working on ""web content"" is the future.  I think the future is television networks moving the pipeline through the same pipeline used by current ""web content.""  And they're going to have the talent, budgets, and resources to get the eyeballs.    So it's more probably the current web content will just get blown away once the big dogs roll in.  So it's probably beneficial to stick with the big content producers if you're looking for a career.  For artistic purposes, you can do whatever you want whenever you want already!"

editors,386qrb,jughead78,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:12:19 2015 UTC,"Hah...perhaps they did.  ;-)  I actually came to like the song after hearing about a thousand times, to be honest.  Sometimes certain genres (like techno) don't immediately do anything for me...but if I can get over whatever my issue is...(for example, I've always hated reggae music)...sometimes I can ""hear"" a track for the first time without my preconceived notions, and appreciate it.  But I admit it's hard.  It took me a long time to get over my ""Elvis issues"".  I just hated his stuff, I suppose because of all the cultural-baggage that came with it.  Elvis impersonators, fat guys in jumpsuits, etc.  But then one day, a light switch flipped in my head...and somehow I was able to hear Elvis just for his music, and his voice...and ever since then have been a fan.    I'm not sure how to describe it; but I've occasionally been able to hear certain music ""fresh"" without my various attachments to it, and it's great when it happens.  Anyway, point being, I understand the ""murder"" comment.  ;-)"

Second, you should be building a network of contacts with people inside and outside of that company.  If you're talented, easy to work with, and act interested you should be getting calls from outside companies.  This is your leverage.  Third, you should definitely ask for a raise from your current employer.  I don't know what you should ask for- generally rates start at 50/hr, but I don't know if that's feasible in your workplace and it's not uncommon to take a little cut for the reliability you have.  But, since you're asking us you should definitely let your employer know you think you're worth more.  It would be better if you had other work offers coming in tho.

Tell your boss you want to continue the great work you're doing at the company, but you haven't had a real adjustment in 4 years.  You won't be happy forever at that day rate.  They'll give you something.  If it's a token few bucks a day, tell them you would expect more given the quality and variety of work that you do.

If they don't, go find a new gig.   I worked at a reality company for 2 years longer than I should have. For the exact reason you state above. I felt I owed then. They, in turn felt they OWNED me. Big difference.   I finally asked for a rate closer to my worth, still in the low end, but, more commensurate with the quality and speed at which I was performing. They said no. I found a new gig and left.   They called me 6 months later (just as the new gig was wrapping up) and hired me as an editor at full rate. Which was higher than I asked for 6 months earlier.   Sometimes you have to leave to get a fair rate because every single ""raise"" you get is based on your original quote.   The company I was talking about earlier basically hired me as a freelancer but treated me as a salaried employee. So I got a 3/5% bump a year, no matter my position.

I.e the start of July or something like that. In the past I have found that if I am working for a client and want to up my rate for that particular client. I might take a job from them and when I have a moment with their production manager or bookings person I'll say something like:  ''Bookings person, just so you know from the first of (following month) I'm going to be bringing the rate I charge for (the company I have been hired by) in-line with my other clients because it is getting a little confusing having different rates and I want to even them out, I hope you dont mind.''

In short, it's the method of keeping all the action in the center of the frame so that action can happen very quickly in front of you and the audience doesn't have to search the screen for it and lose track. It seems to be more of a shooting term than an editing term, but shooting this way makes it possible to edit more quickly because the audience doesn't have to rescan the frame for focal points with each cut.  I actually tend to do the opposite of this for my work. I try to keep the viewers eyes bouncing back and forth from one side of the frame to the other, but then again, I'm not editing fast paced action movies."

It'll be much easier to work with that way.   which are converted to MP4 again before import   That's actually not a good idea. This process, going from very lossy format to very lossy format degrades the video quality due to generation loss.   for whatever reason, OBS recordings don't work with Resolve out of the box.   Resolve has historically been a bit janky when dealing with H.264. Also if your recordings out of OBS are using variable frame rate, that could be a big problem.   I've done everything in the Davinci Resolve configuration guide   This guide? I'm not too familiar with this guide you're talking about.   I've enabled proxy files   But are you creating proxy files?   I've tried a 720p@30fps timeline with 8-bit monitoring and set all monitoring options to the fastest possible or ""optimized for playback."" It specifically says in the configuration guide a single-GPU rig can support up to ~1080i@60fps for real-time playback. I know I'm using 1440p but it's not like this is 4K, and like I said I am getting playback at 30fps once it starts.    Just because your sequence is 720p doesn't change the issues with the source file. Your computer still has to decode all of the video and scale it down.   Is there a standard file format I should be using on Windows, and if so, how do I convert to it from MP4 or H.264?    If you were working at a standard resolution, like 1080p, I'd say use DNxHD. It delivers the same quality as ProRes (nearly lossless), but with much less system impact than H.264. DaVinci supports it natively, and it's easy to produce in ffmpeg, or potentially even DaVinci."

editors,384z4j,tinyenormous,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:42:28 2015 UTC,"I understood exactly what you're looking for, you want a toaster-style external drive dock. But fact remains that if you find one that supports two disks simultaneously you're going to pay through the nose to be able to be able to swap one drive without having to power down the other one as well.  See, hot-swap is a technical term meaning you can yank the drive right out of its bay while the power is still on without causing any problems. The advantage in your case would be that you wouldn't have to eject both disks to remove just one of them, and that's extremely uncommon.  Now, if that's not what you're looking for, and you're fine with ejecting both/all disks to swap just one then you're in far more reasonable territory. However, toaster-style docks that support two or more drives are somewhat uncommon. You might have an easier time finding a rack-style enclosure like this.  Now, while that looks like a big, complicated thing, it really isn't. Bare drives connect to the bay doors to facilitate installation, locking, and removal. A lot of these enclosures use only two Phillips head screws to hold the drive, though there are tool-less (sometimes called tray-less) designs."

editors,382ktl,Kichigai,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:19:15 2015 UTC,"This is my order of preference:   Internal (SATA) eSATA USB 3.0   Except in high-performance servers and some SSDs all hard disks use a SATA connection at the physical drive unit itself, so jumping through as few hoops as possible generally means more reliability and greater performance. Keep It Simple Stupid, right? Being internal also simplifies cable management and reduces the number of auxiliary power supplies you need to manage. Also these drives tend to be cheaper.  eSATA is, electrically, 100% identical to SATA, all they did was change the connector. However all SATA disks are externally powered, so you have to contend with one more device to plug in, and the cable management that comes along with all external drives.  USB 3 drives have a small board in them to go from SATA to USB Mass Storage, and this can sometimes be a bottleneck in terms of performance, or a point of failure. You also lose a lot of control by removing direct access to the SATA bus. This includes performance controls and S.M.A.R.T.."

In your use case RAID offers a single larger volume (0, 5, 6, 10) or an instant mirror (1, 10) but as far as speed goes there's no need.  I think a RAID-1 or RAID-5 seems logical for you. RAID-1 could work as a software, but go hardware if you're going RAID-5. If you're going with a software RAID-1 be sure you look into the process of rebuilding if you lose a drive. An Apple software RAID-1 can't add a drive to the pool and rebuild, for example. See if you can find a documented procedure for the software you're considering. A lot of rolling out a RAID array is planning for when things go wrong."

If you saw the action reel for my friend, I didn't film that. :)   I've applied at VARIOUS production companies as a post-production editor and every place i've applied to only want to pay minimum wage ($7.45 in Texas) or want part-time work (20 or less hours at minimum wage). I was under the impression if I wanted to move up, i'd have to put six months in and show that I could do what they wanted. For eight months, I worked production (camera, audio, on-air graphics/supers) and assisted the full-time editors when asked. Six months in, I asked to be put on salary. They refused. I was getting paid pennies for the same type of work the full timers did. I am looking at going to the next level.  Most post-production places want really young and fresh out of college graduates that's willing to literally ANYTHING. At my age and with my experience, I would be too much of a liability for them because they wouldn't be able to ""fool"" me.  TL;DR, i'm looking to set up my own business.

I wasn't expecting to work on this trip, but I got sucked into a project with my editing laptop back in Texas.  My question:  I bought a laptop where the internal drive has two partitions. Looks like it's 5400 rpm.  Right now, I have Premiere on one partition and my raw footage on the other.  I also have a USB 3 drive that's 5400 rpm that I'm using as a backup.  Is it better to have my raw footage on the same disk but different partition as my OS and Premiere, or should I be working off of the USB drive and use the other partition as a backup?  I'm also doing some light After Effects work, if that matters."
editors,382ktl,Nidty719,3,Fri Jun 5 09:41:20 2015 UTC,"The USB 3 drive and the internal drive are (essentially) going to perform the same.  So having the 'other' things on the external drive makes sense - your internal drive is doing OS things, App things.  I'd probably tell you to keep everything on the external. Maybe keep the caches on the 2nd partition.  Last, I'll tell you to BACK EVERYTHING UP SOMEHOW - because you're remote, with no duplication of media = recipe for disaster."

The thing is, Media Composer is really only superior when it is part of that chain of other Avid products.  Don't get me wrong -- it can definitely be used as an individual editing station, but you'll find Premiere Pro pretty much its equal if not superior in some ways in this setting.

Not sure how it is in other places but I did 2 x 1 week courses with a 2.5 hr exam at the end.  Anything less than 70% is a fail.  2 members in our class of 7 failed.    When I first took it you needed to re-certify annually I believe now it's every 2 years.   (I am up for renewal again this year) for re-newals you do a course online (1 day) with a smaller exam at the end. When I took the course I was surprised how technical it is, not just about editing.  You need to know all about computers (PC and Macs), video cards, RAM, PCI-x, stages of PC start up....etc.    If you want to take it just to learn Media Composer, you are much better off using lynda.com or something like that.  It took awhile for me to get here (there was a learning curve), but now I much prefer Avid over any other editing software, (I use AE along side it daily).

It's for tech support people at rental houses, giant post facilities, networks and in house production companies.   The ""Avid Certified User"" class is all about how to use avid.   Source: I am a certified ACSR who worked in avid tech support for years before switching over to editing.   Normally I would tell people to save the money they would spend on the ""user"" class and just use avid instead of Premiere (or FCP) for their next project. Because the class is a sham.   You can buy a fully licensed version of avid for under a grand. Student version is usually under $500 and its a fully working avid. The only difference is that it says ""student"" on the license. The class is probably more.   For your situation, where you can't use the machines without certification I would say this:  Do you really need to use the machines at school or can you just buy avid and use it on your personal computer anytime you would normally use premiere?   The only reason I am leaning towards telling you to take the class is that you personally will probably learn a lot of the easy shortcuts that make avid the superior product for professional work. Especially since you don't seem to like it.   I learned editing on flat beds (in school) then switched to media 100 finally avid and FCP.   Each system had a learning curve and I always thought the old system was superior before I learned the ins and outs of the new one.   Avid is by far the easiest system once you understand it. The lack of rendering alone saves tons of time. You just need to learn how to cut on a Modal system."

At that time I had about 10 years editing experience with 4 years on Avid.  The 1st week was all editing and was really easy.  The 2nd week was all the technical computer stuff, and I am editor by trade, but I can navigate a computer better than the average, non IT person, but that 2nd week consisted of nothing but studying and cramming. I am a Canadian and working for a very large media company so our Company paid a Avid Rep to come to Toronto and teach us the 2nd week of strictly certified Avid computer systems, rather than sending 7 of us to Avid... The (1st week) was taught by a certified Avid Instructor, showing us the in's and out's of editing (Also in Toronto). The re-cert's I've done have been all online and have been for the most part technical (what is the qualified video card for the z800 system?, how much RAM is required? What slot is the PCI-x card?etc.) There was talk of changing the course layout in 2010, but I don't believe they have.  The last re-cert I did was still heavily technical.  Not sure what I could recommend for Prep... it's studying and understanding all the the Avid systems PC and Mac's and their configurations of each.  I will try look to see if there are any sites that offer the configurations of each will post if I find any.

You're right in thinking that Avid is the go-to for pretty much all film jobs (and TV for the most part).

Terrible, compared to Premiere Pro; but Premiere Pro can be a dog on any network environment. The way to work with Avid is to create a subsequence, export an AAF and import into Adobe After Effects.   What's this I've heard about it not needing to render out?   Not sure what you mean by this. At some level, if you add an effect, somewhere in the chain, it has to be rendered.   Is it really that great, or should I concentrate on honing my Adobe skills?   It has some deep nuance that is missed if you're self taught.

If you were still editing you'd want the approval comps from vfx to have the lut or cdl applied.  And if you're dropping them into editorial you probably will want those things too.  If you're in online or color and sitting with the people who approve then that may be ok.  Usually we don't get dpx to color until we have approval.  Pretty standard though to operate this way.  Often you'll have to label all the shots with a code representing the scene and shot number.  Then you'll give a reference qt along with a list with all the hots you're turning we.

editors,37y66z,Sawell,7,Sun May 31 11:38:56 2015 UTC,"I shoot at the moment in AVCHD (Canon c100), I'm going to get a Ninja so I can shoot in 4:2:2 prores, but at the moment I have a bunch of AVCHD footage I need to grade.   The ProRes material should support 10 bit out of that camera.   This is probably blasphemy in the editing subreddit, but I notice I could potentially grade this footage in Lightroom. I can edit a scene much like a photograph in that sense (which I'm used to coming from a photography background).    Not a blasphemy, but it's the wrong set of approaches/math.   FWIW, Adobe is pitching their new color tools as ""lightroom like""   I guess my question is do I lose any of my dynamic range or colour/pixel data by editing in Lightroom vs Resolve, does Resolve understand an MTS file better than Lightroom, so can draw more data from it?    Resolve handles the material in float space (so does SpeedGrade and so does Premiere (when you use the tool right.))  So subsequent adjustments can 'see' all the way back to the original data.    Or is Resolve just better equipped software-wise to get the most out of the footage? Long-term I definitely want to edit properly in a video suite like Resolve and understand it, probably when I move to Prores.   Resolve or any color grading software is better than Lightroom. Resolve (or Adobe SpeedGrade) is built around a video editors need for playback.  But the real reason you need Resolve (or a different tool) is that professional tools have scopes.  And this is where you may cringe - I'm going to mention some hardware that you probably don't have.  You need a proper color correction environment for grading and no, your photography system isn't good enough. You're going to need D65 lights (right temperature), a grading monitor (Flanders Scientific), a YCrCb converter (like a Black Magic Intensity) and preferably some sort of outboard scopes (they're part of the Flanders.)  Expect this to run at least 2k, and properly closer to 4-6k.   I guess coming from a photography background I get caught up in RAW vs JPG and trying to translate it in video terms. Is AVCHD essentially always a JPG compression comparison wise?    Nope. Video is totally different.  The raw video file is whatever you camera puts out. RAW is a data dump from the sensor - generally unplayable. YES you have to play your footage while grading. It's also unwieldy - and most cameras (like the C100) won't get you that anyway.  AVCHD, is a flavor of h.264 compression. It's JPEG on a full frame...and then only the changes. Which means it's worse than JPG.     A lossy format that you can grade but gives you less info than uncompressed footage, which is why we rely on the picture style alongside trying to get the most uncompressed footage to get the most dynamic range possible?   In video, we're often shooting a flat profile to overcome the limitations of the camera sensors (there's no real HDR yet for video.)  We rely on whatever camera/format we have in hand and try to use optimal shooting strategies to get the best dynamic range.  There is significantly a better grading picture if you shoot 10bit (or greater); sadly most cameras don't support this.  I'm not sure that adding a recorder to the C100 will give you 10 bit."
editors,37y66z,greenysmac,2,Sun May 31 12:24:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's really helpful and enlightening. Yeah unfortunately I can't get 10bit out of the c100 even with an external recorder, it's only 8bit.   I'm just a one man band pretty much and up until now have been 'grading' in premiere using the fast color corrector and RGB curves, I just noticed that LR had the option there and did apply a sort-of-appealing grade to my film with my photography presets, but assumed there must be a downside."

editors,37y66z,boomboxchina,0,Mon Jun 1 02:43:55 2015 UTC,"Sawell, I would take this advice with a grain of salt. The equipment you use depends entirely on where your work will end up. There is no need for all that expensive and precise equipment if your projects will mostly be playing on people's iPhones for example. There is a famous story behind the NS10 audio monitors that became an industry standard despite sounding terrible; if you could get your music to sound good on them, it probably sounds good anywhere.  I edit and grade on an Apple cinema monitor in front of a frosted window that provides real daylight for reference, and the color accuracy is 95% there. If your client isn't the type to miss the 5%, don't bother investing. As technology improves, access to color-accurate equipment is becoming easier and cheaper, and veterans who have already invested will almost never admit you can get by with less.  Even absent any scopes or grading software, pulling up a TV spot or movie with a similar desired look and fiddling with controls to match it can get you pretty far. Good way to learn too.  As for shooting formats, I can't heap enough praise on a 5Dmk3 with the Magic lantern RAW firmware. I've been shooting almost entirely on that format for a year which provides 14-bit, full-frame DNG sequences. If you can afford to invest or rent the CF cards, hard drives, time to download and convert all of it, it's an incredible value."

You have a couple options:   The best option is to get an AJA IOXT, BlackMagic Ultrastudio 4k or similar interface to connect the playback display. The T-Tap doesn't allow Thunderbolt daisy chaining Thunderbolt devices, so you won't be able to use it in conjunction with another display. Ideally this will be connected to a 10-bit display over SDI — something like a Flanders Scientific AM250. Try to stick to tv style products rather than computer monitor style products. The other display will be connected after the I/O device and storage. Dual Thunderbolt displays. Apple's Thunderbolt displays are pricey but they allow for chaining multiple displays. A higher resolution Thunderbolt display seems imminent, but a 2011 laptop may struggle to drive its display and two Thunderbolt displays, let alone higher res displays. This doesn't use your existing displays, but it's an option to get two external displays on a 2011 MBP. An external video card in a Thunderbolt -> PCI card enclosure  could drive the displays. The Thunderbolt chassis start at about $300 and a decent video board will be similar in price.   The truth is a 2011 MBP isn't really equipped to drive that many pixels.

I imagine you could even tint their skin blueish so that you don't even have to do much roto for skin tones - for example when they hold hands and run out of the room.   Or just do it all in post.

We always found that once this error occurred once would not let you transcode any other Long GOP based footage regardless of source or destination until you fully restarted Avid.   To get around this error we ended up sorting the clips that needed to be transcoded by duration and then working our way up (sometimes one by one) from the shortest clips to the longest. Eventually we would find a few clips that would throw up this error consistently and then would have to import them instead rather than AMA.

Multiple times each day - ""Is the Go Pro here yet? Let me know when we get it. It needs to be processed right away. Go Pro Go Pro Go Pro Go Pro""  Finally the drive arrives Thursday morning. I go through all the Go Pro clips. I got shots of the wheels, POV from the hood, I got some setup shot where you can see the car mount inside the car. I got a B camera shot from outside the car, where you can see them driving with the Go Pro mounted inside.  I don't have any freaking 2 shot from the Go Pro inside the car.

editors,37q3u9,asthmakid,4,Fri May 29 21:28:25 2015 UTC,"Came back from the Memorial Day weekend on Tuesday, as planned. What wasn't planned was seeing building maintenance in our equipment room. Turns out the people on the floor below us were complaining about water dripping through their ceiling (again). Turns out the air condition in the equipment room was leaking condensation all over the floor (again). This time it was worse.  The effected floor area was about maybe three feet by five feet. It extended partially under one rack (that housed our in-house NAS, the voicemail system, and battery backups) and a tiny bit under another (which housed the phone system, Internet gear, and all the LAN gear), with a tiny bit of water having gotten into a power box under it. Figuring out what all the cables are is impossible since nothing is labeled and everything is zip-tied together tighter than Satan's butt hole.  And it gets worse. Directly under the air conditioner in question (and thus being dripped on for Helix knows how long) there was wall-mounted gear too. An HDMI-to-HD-SDI converter, an HDMI DA, a VGA DA, and a surge strip powering those two things, a third unknown item (again, zip-ties making cable chasing impossible), and the Wifi access point. Oh, and it gets better: the box housing most of the security system had received the lion's share of the drippage, causing the system to begin complaining about a low battery. Plus paranoia kicked in when I noticed water had been splashing off these objects onto other objects, including other power sources, so I had to kill off the backup drives for our NAS and some of our VXA tape archival gear too.  So I grabbed the biggest piece of non-conductive material I could find and started turning stuff off and unplugging everything I felt I could safely, which killed off the Wifi network, screwing every employee on this half of the office who had a newest generation Macbook Pro, or Macbook Air (suddenly my work laptop sucked a tiny bit less).  Turns out the geniuses who first installed the pump (and zip-tied down the tubing so tight water couldn't flow through it, which was moot since they never connected it to a power source) had fed the condensation pipe too deep into the reservoir, creating enough backpressure to ensure it never filled high enough to trigger the pump, thus causing the AC units to overflow. After adjusting for that, they got a talking to for their power solution being an /r/OSHA approved extension cord running across our archives, instead of hard-wiring it in like they should have done in the first place.    Side WTF: besides synching with the usual incongruent timecode between audio and video (including a few incidents were 12+ hours off, e.g. video timecode started at 21h and audio started at 9h), and the video guy stopping but the audio guy not, I had some real fun with some C300/C500 footage.  First was that for some reason Canon never thought I'd want the source's gamma curve identified in the bin. Only weeks after ingest, when checking on something else, did I find out in the XF Utility that all our footage was LOG. Sweet. So now I have 1.8TB of footage that was supposed to have LUTs but never got them.  And then there was this clip, which started at timecode 23:55:32:16, and rolled over to 00:00:00:00 as expected. Then it did something less expected. Yes, right at a chunk border too, but far as I can tell, looks fine to me! I don't even know any more.  But on the plus side, this comment from /u/volunteeroranje actually helped me out since this enormous project called on AMAing to I don't even want to know how many thousands of clips for ingest, and went far in improving performance."

First thing, if any of your clips in fcpx are ""nested"" or ""grouped"", have effects on them, or pretty much anything other than straight cuts, you're fucked. It doesn't work right. Your editor needs everything stripped to the bones. Duplicate the sequence so you have your master and then a clean version if you need to relink to later.  The resolve trick sorta works, but again, same issue about any nesting or effects.   The way I eventually made it was to go into fcpx, remove all effects, nesting, compounds, etc, ran that through xto7, and then I honestly forget exactly what I did, but somehow it ended up in Premiere. Either way it was a terrible ordeal and I feel very bad for you. This experience with X was legit my final straw and now you seriously can't pay me enough to ever work with that software again.  As for the 1.4 or less, he is referring to the versions of FCPX. There was a massive overhaul in 10.9 (i think) and I'm assuming something between 1.4. and 1.5 prevents him from being able to work on newer versions of files....and that's exactly the way Apple wants it. Our way or no way.  There is some fcpxml to regular xml converter (pro2xml or something like that), but both versions, I read, are a crap shoot on whether they work right or not. Not worth the $60 or $150 for the pro version IMHO."

And yet your struggles kinda indicate you were at least a good bit wrong this time. Have you not been listening to the 4+ years of folks writing that X takes some very different approaches to timeline thinking? I suspect that looking on the Apple list for someone in your area who's FCP X certified and paying them for an hour or two of expertise never even crossed your mind, did it? Look, I understand.

For example of you had two 2tb drives you could either configure them in RAID 0 which will give you 4tb of usable storage but means that if either of the drives fail then you will lose all the data (it writes half the data to each drive which gives you in theory double the read and write speed), configure them in RAID 1 which means you will have 2tb of usable storage and if either of the drives fail you will keep all your data (it writes the data to both drives), or if you have more you can configure them in raid 5 or 6 which is preferable because it combines faster read and write speeds and some tolerance for drive failure).

Are these consumer drives (cheapest at the time you bought them?)  Yeah, Going over to a raid with enterprise disks is SOOOO much safer.  My comment about the drive (above) is that it's a consumer drive - not really meant for 12h+ days.   And I don't really trust portables (in general) except for shuttling media - or holding stuff I don't need often. I'd suggest two 'desktop"" drives for longer term storage.   A raid will just give you a better live environment. You're still going to need the other drives for longer term backup."

I currently have 2 other 2TB drives (portables) that are duplicates of the desktop drive, for safe keeping.   Please tell me you're backing up your primary 2TB drive as well. A backup of the internal alone is insufficient to safeguard against catastrophic failure.   I've been looking into getting further desktop storage, and always see a RAID setup mentioned, however I don't fully understand how they work/setup, or even if what they offer would benefit me enough at this stage.   I've explained this one before, but for simplicity sake I won't just copy/paste it here. The basics of it are: why do you want a RAID array? Speed? Redundancy? Or to make a huge storage pool? In that link I explain the different kinds of RAID array configurations and their pros and cons.  The actual nuts-and-bolts of setting up and maintaining an array will depend on the way your array is connected, how it's set up, and the system you choose. For the most part they're not too hard to keep track of, but the management of an array connected by DAS will be different than NAS, and RAID5 different from RAID1.   Would say a 4TB external drive be likely better off for me, than setting up a RAID system with zero prior knowledge (and not a ton of money, not sure how expensive they are either in comparison).   A 4TB drive will be much cheaper. However you really need to make sure you have a backup solution for all that data. A RAID array's advantage against a 4TB disk is that, depending on how it's set up, there may be no single point of failure. For example: a RAID5 array can tolerate the failure of one disk without loss of data, but if your single 4TB disk fails then you're toast.  Just remember, though: RAID is not a backup, so no matter what storage solution you choose you really do need to have a backup solution as any RAID array can suffer catastrophic failure and lose some or all of its data."

editors,37pakv,gm7cadd9,1 point,Fri May 29 16:56:46 2015 UTC,"RAIDs offer some data protection, but fail in offering total protection. The different type of RAIDs more or less offer you time before a total failure. RAID 0 or a stripe offers you no time buffer, when any drive in your RAID 0 fails, all data is lost and you must revert to a backup, it is purely for speed and having a large single volume.   RAID5, and RAID 6 seem like they will get you more time, but my advice if your RAID5/6 is running in degraded mode (a failed drive) start a backup before a rebuild (a rebuild is what happens when you put in a new drive and the RAID attempts to repopulate the new drive with the lost data). The remaining drives often fail during a rebuild as the RAID hits the existing drives pretty hard, and then all your data is lost. If you are on a deadline and need to get a project out the door you could complete the project with a failed drive, and then deal with it after the project is delivered (The time thing I mentioned).  In light of this, I often run RAID 0 /Stripe for my main and keep an active backup of my working data to another drive array that isn't particularly fast.  If you go the GSpeed route, their RAID 5/6 is fully capable of high speeds if you can live with the reduced total storage from running it. If you look at a RAID as more for speed than for protection you'll be fine.  Thanks,    -N"

Would expect that for a high end deck, particularly at 24p, but that's the only place 4x3 is used. Aside from 1440x1080 at a 1.33par?  In the past I've always been able to get answers within a couple hours when I ask the provider of the specs. Sometimes they say ignore that part, sometimes it's an easy fix.

Sometimes they say ignore that part, sometimes it's an easy fix.   I'd love to ask them. It makes a whole lot of sense to just stop wasting time and ask them.

editors,37orfx,HeresJonny247,5,Fri May 29 05:25:29 2015 UTC,"See if you can find an experienced DIT in your market to work with and learn from. For bigger shows they might need a digital loader or dedicated media manager.  Ultimately though, the DIT role involves much more than just the media management. The DIT is responsible for maintaining image fidelity from acquisition all the way to handing off to post. These duties can range from live color grading and building looks with the DP, camera matching (often in camera, so learn how to color matrix), working with lighting board ops for proper exposure, signal conforming and conversion, DX, camera troubleshooting and quite a few other things in addition to the media management / proxy workflows.  A good DIT shares skills with camera assistants, colorists, and assistant and online editors.  Just remember that even when you are merely doing the media management, you are responsible for the most valuable part of the shoot, the footage. Learn your shit on proper media management or you'll end up ruining a day's work and that will probably be the end of that work relationship."

editors,37orfx,kissmyrobot,2,Sat May 30 06:23:57 2015 UTC,"/u/DaCristobal hit the nail on the head. I often DIT and I'm actually sitting at camera prep for a feature.... waiting until the camera is up enough to start marking out our framelines and to load looks into the camera.  It's really an interdisciplinary position. Not every job will need every skill of yours but I've certainly done everything from setting up shoots for multi-camera live switching to throwing cold packs on RED ONEs and praying that they last through shoot days in the desert (not that anyone still uses the RED ONE, but the camera's cooling is fundamentally flawed).  The absolute minimum you should be familiar with is managing/backing up media and then knowing how to prep that footage, if at all, for editorial. Avid, for instance, has many white papers and technical guides (sounds scary but they're short and well written) for dealing with Arri Alexa Footage, RED footage, etc.  What's nice is the job is far easier than, say, even three years ago. Black Magic Resolve has really replaced more expensive pieces of software like Assimilate Scratch and some of the other tools we were relying on.  But yeah, it's such an expansive domain feel free to message me. I'm LA based if that makes a difference.  Edit: Also be aware that, at least in the US, DIT is part of the camera team so their immediate need comes before prepping footage for post. Your immediate boss on set is the DP."
editors,37orfx,centurylight,2,Fri May 29 17:37:49 2015 UTC,"DIT is an interesting position. The head of Light Iron, arguably the biggest name in DIT has said it's a dying position. We're getting closer and closer to data transfer speeds and storage access speeds that media management is incredibly fast if we'll-financed. On set color grading is now possible with Resolve, a free application which is getting easier to use with every release. Using tools like lumberjack and prelude logger you can have scripty generate XMLs that will bin and label all of your media upon import. The future is a bit dim in this profession, speaking as someone that spent awhile in the thick of it.   Until that future arrives however, you will need amazing computer skills, knowledge of the inner workings of whichever cameras are on set, a bit of assistant editor knowledge, and an ability to read the scopes as well or better than the DP.   It requires a hefty investment in gear, and you'll be competing against people that have either proven themselves or can offer perks like same-day iPad dailies and live monitoring on ad-hoc wifi networks. You will be second guessed by everyone else in camera department of given control over more than you can bite off more than a couple times. People will constantly think of you as the media manager and sometimes will assume you're just a PA dragging and dropping files. People will also randomly ask you tech problems concerning their phone or personal computer, it's just a part of being surrounded by computers for a living. If you mess up you can cost an entire production an entire day's worth of footage, which can be worth more than you'll make in a year. No pressure.   On the plus side, productions that can afford you will offer you an amazing look at a professional workflow and experience that you'll draw on for years to come. Good luck. :)"

The latest Mac CUDA drivers, along with the CC 2014 software haven't been playing nice (at least for me) for quite some time. If I switch to OpenCL, all is well. But the minute I switch to CUDA and I have Premiere and AE open and rendering, the thing panics and I have to sit through a restart.   Adobe knows about the issue (it's in this thread) and it seems to be related to the NVIDIA cards. As of yet, however, there seems to be no solution other than retiring CUDA for now. An NVIDIA rep chimed in the discussion:   NVIDIA is aware of the issues some of you have been experiencing with GPUs, Mac OS X Yosemite and Premiere Pro CC.  We’ve been doing extensive work internally and with Adobe to determine the source of the problem. We know the CUDA performance advantage you get with Premiere Pro CC on Mac is important for video pros, so finding a solution is a top priority.  It’s not yet clear that the issue is directly related to CUDA, but we’re looking at all options.  NVIDIA GPUs support both CUDA and OpenCL, so the temporary solution we suggest is to run Premiere Pro CC using OpenCL.  You can select this from within the Project Settings menu.  Choose “Mercury Playback Engine GPU Acceleration (OpenCL)”.  This setting appears to reduce the occurrence of the problem.  As soon as we identify a fix that lets you return to fast CUDA acceleration, we’ll provide an update here.   TL;DR: Switch to OpenCL for now and I bet your kernel panics go away."

I dunno what capacity or type of projects you're editing but two things I look for in an editor is how their files are organized and if their timelines are as well.   Generally...if I have a multicam shoot with off camera audio then I organize them in Finder... CAM1 -> all of cam1 files in that director, CAM2 -> those files, CAM3 -> those files, AUDIO --> Audio files. Then I drag the CAM1 directory from finder into the project...bam...no need to even organize it from there. I've got it.   My projects typically have these folders... VIDEO (sub folders to further organize the footage) GFX AUDIO (then sub folders for VO, SFX, Music, Prod Elements, Off Camera Audio)  SEQUENCES  If I have to pass on my project to someone else then it's all nicely setup so they dont have to spend a ton of time looking for stuff. And if you juggle alot of projects at once then if you are always consistent then you'll save time by doing it like that."

Often times I have updates and versions flying in at BREAKNECK speed. Multiple concurrent projects with pressing deadlines. Producers sweating to see things, and get stuff out the door. I just don't have the time or bandwidth to copy stuff onto my drive correctly, then do it again in Premiere.  It seems bonkers that I can't just use my Finder to do the job."

Do I REALLY have to go into my Finder every time I update GFX elements (which happens 10 times a day for me), open the appropriate (IDENTICAL!) bins in Premiere and drag them each into the bin?

You put forth a bit of effort at the beginning and you actually never have to render anything...changes in the AE project will just change in your timeline automatically. A more run and gun way is if your revising graphics...you don't need to keep ten versions. Just overwrite old graphics with the new ones...same file name and you wont have to really do anything. You will never get another NLE to work the way FCPX does in this respect...BUT... you can actually find ways to improve on your workflow in terms of handling audio, graphics, media encoder and all that."

The ""dirty swap"" technique, where you keep overwriting versions with the same filename works sometimes but we are always acquiring ALT versions and then there are actual new elements, so that's not viable.    As far as dynamic link to AE, I don't think our servers are trustworthy enough for me to edit on my station and link to the gfx department's AE project on another station?"

You're dragging them into the timeline, as you said, so why is it such a big deal to drag into the bin first?

editors,37nktf,cut-it,1 point,Fri May 29 16:56:55 2015 UTC,Sync? No. FCP didn't do that either.  You should be able to grab your media in folders and Premiere should mirror the folder structure.  You can't drag into the timeline - it has to have a reference in the project.  (FCP technically had it in the project in your sequence with no visual sign that you've imported anything.)

editors,37nktf,KevinTwitch,0,Fri May 29 03:44:16 2015 UTC,FCP never updated folders based on what you did in Finder. The most you would do is drag files directly to the timeline and it would not put the media in the project bin. Premiere does it pretty much the same way but it will add it to the project bins. The closest thing I can think of is Premieres media browser where you can set up favorite directories (based on Finder) that will always show whatever you put in them. BUT whatever media you grab from there it will still technically import it into the project.   The functionality you're talking about I have no idea about and have never encountered itin my many years of editing with FCP 7. I'm really baffled by what system of media management you use...and how you've avoided the very basic system that pretty much every NLE utilizes.

editors,37lm1l,Kichigai,2,Thu May 28 16:44:09 2015 UTC,"Depends on a few different factors.   What format is the 4K footage in? RAW? XAVC? Are you editing from 1080p versions of the 4K footage, or the original 4K source material? If so, what format are those 1080p files in?   Color grading at 1080p will be more responsive, but depending on what your 4K is like and if you used 1080p transcodes that might give you more latitude in how far you can push things. However for a corporate video that might not be an important factor whatsoever."
editors,37lm1l,Kichigai,1 point,Thu May 28 16:18:46 2015 UTC,"Hi, Kichigai. The files from the vendor appear to be Sony RAW (mxf files). I'm likely just going to edit at 1080/24p in Premiere...although later I might want to open this Mac trash can up and see what it can do. The main intent is to get a large amount of b-roll clips at the ready, likely using ProRes."
editors,37lm1l,Kichigai,4,Thu May 28 16:55:05 2015 UTC,"Well I suppose the big question is how aggressively do you think you're going to be doing color grading with these clips? And are you going to want to do any reframing? Edit: OK, that's two questions, so sue me.  If you're going to be pushing these clips hard then you might want the additional color information you can eek out of a camera RAW (16-bit/4:4:4), compared to ProRes (10-bit/4:2:2 or 4:4:4). Even if the camera RAW was 4:2:2, the fact you're scaling it down to roughly 1/4 resolution means it'd end up providing 4:4:4-grade color resolution at 1080p.  Now if you aren't going to be doing anything nutso, perhaps working with 1080p ProRes 422 HQ or even 4444 might be enough. Your big bottleneck with the RAW is going to be throughput. 4K RAW is ~1GbPS, which is a tall ask from a lot of storage systems."
editors,37lm1l,penilehubris,3,Thu May 28 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"The color correction will be pretty straightforward. I may do some reframing for the occasional shot, but most are good to go, thanks to a great DP and tuned-in gaffer.    That said, since I'll have the 4K handy if I need it, I might as well just convert to ProRes 422, and do the CC there. If any clips have 'special needs', I can always tap into the 4K file.   Thanks for the valuable input!"

Edit: one more thing - I'd suggest that you use a LUT to get the S55 to REC 709 so it looks normal and do that via a Lumetri Look; those then automagically will get passed to Speedgrade.  Resolve is a far better environment for CC - but it's a commitment to learn; Adobe SpeedGrade is far easier in the Adobe world; but won't play in RT because of the way it works with Ppro."

Premiere will read DNxHD MXF files and you can keep the Avid MediaFiles structure.  Export any bin contents/stringout sequences to AAF. Import into Premiere and continue to organize as needed then give to story producer.  Story Producer works in Premiere, selects sequence they'd like to export and exports as AAF.  Bring AAF into Avid and voila.  Granted I'd test the workflow for any unique ""gotchas"" but that should work fairly headache free since your story producer is cutting from the same set of MXFs with the same tape names and timecodes.  While Prelude feels like the most appropriate app, you'd have to translate it to a Premiere project before getting to spit out a AAF. Prelude has a bunch of tagging and marking features I don't think survive the trip through AAF either, but it may be worth a small amount of testing. Prelude is easier to use than Premiere and it's lighter on system resources; it was designed for field producers."

editors,37n42b,justcarlos01,2,Thu May 28 21:12:24 2015 UTC,"There is a more exact rule somewhere, as it has to do with screen resolution and the resolving power of your eyes. With 20/20 vision the rule of thumb is position yourself away from the screen double it's diagonal measurement. Any further and your eyes stop resolving the full detail of the screen.  As far as ""immersive"" viewing I would begin to look at videogames. They actually include field of view angle so the screen feels like a window. If the field of view is too wide or too narrow for the viewing position, it can actually induce motion sickness in players. You'll notice PC has a wider field of view because the player is usually sat closer to the screen while console ports will often narrow that view as console players are positioned further back from television sets.  To apply this to video, you have to shoot footage with this in mind so the better examples of the combination would be motion simulators or immersive amusement park rides."

editors,37k04e,ashreipinkus,7,Thu May 28 04:35:10 2015 UTC,"an MXF wrapped in a quicktime file   First up: this doesn't really make any sense, as MXF and MOV are both wrappers. So you're saying you have a wrapper wrapped in another wrapper. Do you mean you have DNxHD wrapped in a MOV?   Rendering out 50gb of data per version of the film was incredibly time intensive, so I was wondering if there was any sort of short cut available.   Non-burned in subtitles. I know it's not the answer you're looking for, but that's why they were created: as a solution to this problem.  Now if you just want to save time, kick out your master, bring it back in, and drop your subtitles in on top of that. It'll at least save you from having to re-render all the elements of the video, and if it's coming in as DNxHD, ProRes, or CineForm it'll process pretty quickly; however you'll still have 50GB of video.   My thought was that in the future, I could save a tremendous amount of time if I only had to render out the video without subtitles, and then render out each subtitle track with some sort of transparency channel.   You mean like a DVD Subpicture stream?   Then, for whatever version of the film is necessary for screening, whoever is creating the master could mix and match elements and export in whatever format is required. Is this possible, and if so, would it actually save more time?   Well, here's the bad news: depending on what you export your subtitle stream as, it may be moot. DNxHD will consume precisely as much space as it is told to, as it is a fixed bitrate format. So DNxHD 115 will always consume 115MbPS, whether it needs to or not. ProRes will be a lot more forgiving, though. Either way, you'll still be stuck with a lot of extra video.  A smarter way to handle this would be the way we've received Open Captions (burned-in captions) in the past: each subtitle is a transparent PNG and an XML file identifies their sequence and placement. You then import your copy of the movie and drop the XML sequence on top of it and kick it out. The PNG sequence and XML file will consume significantly less space than another video stream.   Is this possible, and if so, would it actually save more time?   Theoretically it's possible, but I don't think it'll save you any time.  First you have to export your master video. That'll take X amount of minutes. Then you have to export your first subtitle track. That should take Y amount of minutes. Then you have to export your second subtitle track, which should also take Y amount of minutes. Then, if you've got 'em, you have to export your third, fourth, and fifth tracks (ad nauseum) which should take Y amount of minutes.  So now you have your multiple video files. You transmit them to whoever is going to watch it, and now they have to spend Z amount of time combining the two tracks and exporting it themselves for each version they want to present.  It might save you time, but it'll cost time for your exhibitors, and they're not going to like that. That's more time spent on their part doing something that you're generally expected to handle for them. In fact, a lot of exhibitors may not even have the tools to do this themselves. If you hand this off to a theater they might not have an NLE to use. If you're handing this off to a film festival they're already busy trying to conform all the videos they're receiving for final presentation, they're not going to want to have to deal with sorting out which subtitles go where.  Not only that, but you're putting the final quality of video in their hands. They might have some intern handling it who makes the final a ProRes Proxy file. Or somewhere along the line the subtitles might get knocked out of synch, and things no longer match up right. They might interpret your Rec. 709 video as full range RGB and totally wash everything out. There's a lot of unknowns when you just let things fly down the line like this.  The smarter move is to make all the masters yourself. That way you can control what the final presentation is like. You'll know for a fact that what gets shown is in synch, and it's as high quality as possible. You can do quality control on each and every one. And if a distributor or exhibitor comes back with a problem you can be 100% positive that the problem isn't your fault (which will save you a lot of trouble if they really get mad).  See, here's the thing: distribution isn't what you want. It's what your distributor wants. If it were up to me we'd be sending DNxHD MXF Op1a files to all our clients, but that's not how it works. I have to make ProRes 1080p23.976 for Disney, DNxHD 145 1080i29.97 for NBCU, HDCAM-SR for WB, XDCAM 35 for the local PBS affiliate, and an additional DigiBeta for CBS. Client wants a project for the web and they say H.264, so I make an H.264. Client says they want DVCPro HD for in-store displays, I make DVCPro HD. A theater wants a DCP for their digital projector, you bet I'll figure out what I need to do to make a DCP.  You never know what's going to happen once things go down the line, so your best bet is always to follow K.I.S.S.: Keep It Simple Stupid. The more moving parts you introduce the more opportunities there are for things to go wrong, so idiot-proof it as much as you can on your end to ensure things stay as sane as possible on the other end.   I'm a college student, so forgive me if I'm making any beginner's mistakes in my line of thinking   You asked a question, so it's not like there's much to forgive. You asked the question to avoid making a mistake, so I don't think you need to feel sorry about that one bit."

Then download the .srt file then use handbrake again but this time, use the .srt file and only compress (not downscale) the 4k copy of video.

Closing a bin takes 10 seconds - maybe more like 5 on the high side.  Perhaps you have too many sequences in the bin? Admittedly it does take stupid long when there a lot of sequences in a bin – but Avid's bin architecture is a strength and a weakness.   Digital Cut - I haven't used this for years so I don't know.  I just export these days.  Waveforms - I have it set to show only waveforms in selected areas, this is the only way I can use waveforms because otherwise it is too insanely slow and shitty.  What bothers me is the damn mixboard slows down my editing in the timeline because so much CPU/GPU time is taken up animating the goddamn little meters and sliders in the mixboard.

I was never properly taught Avid in film school.  I got into post production through a FCP TV show.  I hated Avid.  Daily, I wished for its death in exchange for the clearly superior FCP.    A few years later it was time to further my career.  ""Damn, all these jobs use Avid.""  So I trained up, read several books, the whole nine yards.  I ended up seeing why it is preferred so much.  I ended up liking it better than my precious FCP and being much faster on it too.  That was 8-ish years ago.  Last year I cut an hour long program on FCP (just 1 episode).  I could not believe how biased I used to be.  I mean..

Does anyone else find that clicking response time is absolutely fucking unacceptable?   Depends on the project. In projects with lots of AMA media, yeah, it can be pretty bad. At least in Media Composer 7. That's why we work native and keep the AMA Media as segregated as possible.   Closing a bin takes 10 seconds?   This may actually be a function of the file system. Spin the disk, call to the OS to access this file, file is found, file is overwritten, filesystem tables that reference this file, when it was accessed, how large it is, and where on the disk to find it are written, and then if necessary any indexing information for search is written to the index, file marked as closed and Media Composer is given the go-ahead to proceed.  This is why copying a lot of small files takes so much longer than copying one huge file.   The digital cut record button takes another 10 seconds?   Again, this may be a function of Media Composer coping with the rest of the system. I haven't made a tape in Premiere but I recall several times where Final Cut would pinwheel for a few seconds upon clicking the Print To Tape button.   Then there's the loading of the waveform on the timeline -might as well take a coffee break because navigating the timeline while the waveform is loading is pretty much useless.   Right up until Media Composer 7 using waveforms was a major pain in the ass. However with 7.0 and the inclusion of a proper waveform cache performance in this area has dramatically improved.   Am I the only one?! If not, why are we OK with this?!   Because it's the best tool for the job. I don't know any other NLE out there that offers the same, complete feature set as Media Composer, especially in the collaborative editing process.   Just frustrated that I'm in an abusive relationship with Media Composer.   So go out to the Avid Forums and express your frustration there.

If you just need to see the comments while editing the Multicam sequence, then I would put my nest in V1 in the timeline, then double click all of the individual layers in your nest and copy those and paste them in the same sequence as the nest. Then just line the nest up with what you copied into the sequence, but hide all of the layers except the nest. You should be able to see all the comments and multi cam everything.

You want to do a few things with this reel:  1)   Show the QUALITY of the work.  This means the best cinematography shots, the most eye-popping graphic shots.  30-45 sec is a VERY short time to show what you've got.  Only include the best of the best.  2)  Show the NOTEWORTHINESS of the work.  Have Tom Cruise in a shot?  Make sure you show that.  Is one of your shots from a massive tentpole summer blockbuster?  Make sure you show that, and make sure there's enough time for folks to register what it is.  Potential clients will look at it, and think, ""Well, heck, if Tom Cruise/Christopher Nolan/Michael Bay trusts them to do their work, then I can too.""  3)  Try to have some kind of through line.  The best sizzles will not just be a haphazard collection of killer visuals, but will also have an arc, or a theme, or something that ties the whole thing together.  Music will have a big impact on this.  Choose it wisely.  4)  Pace is important.  But at 30-45 sec, you will want to pace it quickly enough to show a great deal of work.  Variety.  Show that your company has done a LOT of cool stuff.  Try not to revisit the same project twice in the reel, especially since it's so short. People will be able to tell if it's taken from the same project.    Finally, the big temptation will be to make your shots too short, since you have so little time.  Give them enough time to register.  Music will have a big impact on this.  Choose it wisely.  :)"

You need to guide the viewer's eye throughout the entire film so that they're catching what's important in every shot. If they're focusing on something far left in the frame, don't cut to something far right. Or, at least, do it as little as possible. Matching camera movement, subject movement, and shapes are helpful as well.  Okay, just to give an example from my own reel, I have a sequence of shots where an empty glass is being placed on a bar, then a fresh cocktail is being placed on a bar, then I cut to a view down a row of grapes at a vineyard. It might be my favorite part because they tie together quite nicely. The first two connect because of the mirrored actions, and the second and third connect because the viewer is already focused dead center."

Three things to consider are phone battery life, file size, and unreliability of the talent. They are not on the production team so it's a lot to ask them to use their phones (which they already use constantly) as a tool for production. They might be totally cool with it, but you may have issues where the app crashes or they don't record properly.  I'd go with a cheap mic and cheap recorder like the ones below. These two seem to be well reviewed and are cheaper than the microphone you are currently looking at. The recorder has a lock so you can set them all to record early in the day and be sure they are synced and rolling all day long. Then in post you can assign timecode and sync them up to your footage easily. You'll need a bunch of batteries for sure and the audio is limited to compressed MP3s (though you could splurge for a better recorder), but I'd trust this more than their phones any day.  http://www.amazon.com/Neewer-3-5mm-Hands-Computer-Microphone/dp/B005DJOIHE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1432675124&sr=8-1&keywords=lavalier  http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-VN-722PC-Recorders-Built---Memory/dp/B00HFW1E1A/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1432675204&sr=8-3&keywords=audio+recorder"

editors,37ekcp,Hot_Computer_ASL,1 point,Wed May 27 01:30:40 2015 UTC,"iMac (Late 2009)  3.06 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo   Yeah, that's pretty under-powered for After Effects in this day and age.   16 Mb ram   I assume you meant GB. Typically 32GB is preferred, but depending on what you're doing 16GB might be enough.   ATI Radeon HD 4670 256 MB  Running CS6 AE   This is a big bottleneck for you, since this predates OpenCL support, both the hardware and the software. So that means all your video encoding and decoding is being handled by your CPU, which is quite under-powered for this kind of job, in addition to any other effects processing that it has to do.   Footage is on internal drive   Bad idea. You've got your OS, your render caches, After Effects libraries, and your source footage all competing for limited throughput coming off your drive. Even worse: if you're running out of RAM now you've got the system paging out to the HDD to stash stuff temporarily, which will really thrash the hell out of that disk.  FYI: if you've never replaced it, you'll want to do so ASAP. I tend not to trust hard disks for more than three years of life, especially if they're a boot drive. No one warranties hard disks beyond five years (and those are your industrial datacenter drives, which you most definitely aren't using) so likely that sucker is on borrowed time. You can get a good new hard disk for pretty cheap, and install it yourself, though it will require a little bit of work, with guides available for the 21.5"" version and 27"" version of the models of iMac that match your specs.   I don't have thunderbolt so going external will mean USB 3.    USB 3 should be fast enough if you get a fast enough hard disk. Except you don't have USB 3 either, locking you into USB 2 performance which you should avoid like the plague.  You're better off going for a Firewire 800 capable disk. OWC, G-Technology, and LaCie (in order of my preference) make good ones. Look for a 7200 RPM drive, preferably one with a 64MB cache or larger. 3.5"" disks tend to get better price per gigabyte and perform better over longer a longer time than the 2.5"" portable disks.   I'm only editing h264 HD, so it should not be struggling for real-time playback   Actually, you should be. 1080p H.264 was a bit of a struggle to get playing on machines of that age, but now you've got all the added heft of OS X laying on top too. I'm not shocked at all that you're having trouble. Not only that, but back in 2009 your typical H.264 video was encoded using Main or Baseline Profiles, and now we're in and era where High Profile is far more typical, which requires a lot more oomph to process.   (I'm at fricken 1/4 resolution!!)   Irrelevant. Because of the way most forms of H.264 work, you're stuck not only decoding an entire frame to produce a 1/4 resolution preview, but also several frames before and after it. So to view any one frame your computer might have to decode anywhere from two to fifteen full-size frames of video just to produce one preview frame for you. It's extremely processor intensive.   It really sucks having to RAM preview every time for playback.    Maybe if you transcoded your footage to ProRes you could potentially see some performance improvements, but if you're doing anything relatively intensive you're going to have to do a RAM preview anyway.  I'd suggest upgrades, but truth is with the iMac you're just as stuck with what you've got as any laptop user, so the only way for you to move up to better performing hardware is to get a whole new computer."

You will always have to Preview for realtime playback.  It's a compositing program designed to work with mixed media/formats so it views everything as raw pixel values. Unlike a NLE it doesn't send a codec to a playback engine (notice how you don't select a codec when making a sequence).  When you hit play, each frame is built from scratch.  Also, h264 is one of the slower codecs to work with in AE since it has to decompress each frame.  Use ProRes, Animation or an Image Sequence. Codecs with less compression are better and less likely to cause render issues.  TLDR: Don't sweat it."

editors,37amer,Iggapoo,8,Tue May 26 06:49:03 2015 UTC,A high shutter speed mainly results in toning down blur in moving video. It's used in action footage like sporting events so that fast moving action is clear.  Also used as an effect in some films since it has a very distinctive look.  Rolling shutter is an artifact from some types of cameras not being able to handle horizontal motion of the camera properly. It's typically an undesirable look.

editors,37amer,holomntn,3,Tue May 26 20:49:32 2015 UTC,If the lambo team didn't use a shock mount (which does exactly what it sounds like and absorbs sudden bounces) then the camera would jiggle around a lot causing a noticeable rolling shutter effect.
editors,37amer,holomntn,1 point,Tue May 26 21:08:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly. All of the bouncing around that the car does gets translated directly to the camera if there isn't a shock mount (and with a super firm sport suspension like I'm sure both cars have, that's going to be a lot).  The cause of the jubblies is rolling shutter. The way most modern video cameras work is to scan one horizontal line of pixels at a time, from top to bottom, rather than capturing every pixel at exactly the same time. So what happens with fast motion is this: in the time it takes the ""shutter"" to roll from top to bottom, objects within the frame have moved, so they don't line up within the frame as they should. When you have weird, random, fast movement, it creates the jello effect you see in the lambo footage. If you turn on the video camera on your phone and wave it left & right, you can probably see the jello effect in action."

I would go still image sequence from Cinema4D into something like FFMPEG to actually encode the h.265 file.  Any image format (DPX, TIFF) is acceptable as well as ProRes (encoded through a non-standard encoder like FFMPEG, since it's technically not resolution limited, but you'd be working in ""uncharted territory"") but then you're getting into really beefy hard drive setups on whatever workstation is powering the display. Doing a little head math, H.265 at this resolution could probably play without issue off a dedicated HD or an SSD.  I would also look at digital signage software. It's not my forte but I wouldn't be surprised if one function is to stitch multiple videos into one high res output. I recall something like vMix (if that's the name) and other software may be what you want.  I assume the workstation is feeding multiple HDMI or SDI signals?

The workstation currently have a regular 2tb drive, but i'l throw 2 dedicated SSD drives in raid 0 in there if the regular drive turns out to become a bottleneck. Also you are correct, we are running a single AMD Firepro card with 3 outputs that is connected to some special hardware from Matrox for splitting the screens and images making us able to run at a maximum of 12 screens in a 4x3 video wall setup, Windows see this setup as a single 7680x3240 screen.

editors,3776he,greenysmac,2,Mon May 25 13:03:39 2015 UTC,Can anyone provide a comprehensive/easy breakdown of reading waveform monitors? I still can't wrap my head around aspects of it. Or if you can describe how they all work exactly I would appreciate it!
editors,3776he,GenerallySpecific,5,Mon May 25 13:44:27 2015 UTC,"Sure! A more common term would be ""reading scopes"" as a waveform monitor is just one of several tools we check for signal accuracy. Just starting from the basics, all video is essentially a signal. It used to be an analog signal, but since the late 90's it's become more and more a digital signal, but it's mostly the same. Video is comprised of two basic components: luminance (light levels), and chroma (color levels).   The one you mentioned is the most common, the waveform monitor. It gives you a reading of luminance levels in your image. Take your image, and divide it into vertical columns of pixels (imagine 1920 columns for an HD image). Your first column will have 1080 individual pixels, all with their own level of brightness or luminance. Your waveform plots these values on a scale of 0-255 as little green dot. Let's say the bottom half of your image is absolute black, the bottom half of the column's pixels will all have the same value. That's a lot of pixels citing the same value of 0. The waveform deals with this pixel density by representing it as either a dark green dot (a single value) or a bright dot (multiple values, the more the brighter). This is why you'll typically see several dots in the same column, all with varying brightness.  Add in all the other columns and you'll start to see patterns that correlate with your image. If you have a patch of blown out sky in the top right of your image, you'll have a mass of dots on the right of the waveform (representing its horizontal position in the image) all concentrated at the top (representing its luminance value).  There's also the Vectorscope, one of the tools that deals with chroma. In short, it's a wheel where each degree (or spoke, if you will) represents a particular color. Its position relative to the center cites its signal strength (stronger pixels are closer to the center, weaker signals closer to the edge). The boxes in the vectorscope correlate with the colors in a test pattern, like SMPTE bars, for the purposes of calibration. If you view color bars through a vectorscope, and your monitor is properly calibrated, all the dots in the scope will group in the boxes.  Other scopes include Waveform+YC (which is a chroma waveform superimposed over a luminance waveform) and RGB parade (three separate chroma waveforms citing values for the three color channels: red, green, and blue).  If you have questions, ask away!"
editors,3776he,EventTrigger,2,Mon May 25 15:09:43 2015 UTC,"/u/EventTrigger's explanation is a good one, but it sounded like you were asking about all the various scopes, so I'll add a bit.  The waveform monitor, as said, shows luminance values in your frame. As an editor, you use it in a general sense to make sure values aren't ""illegal"" (ie: out of arbitrary range of brightness and darkness values set for broadcast). When you look at it enough you can start to see how the waveform image relates to your actual frame and adjust accordingly.  The vectorscope is a circular monitor that shows the saturation level of color in your frame. Like luminance, color can be ""illegal"" if it's too saturated. It'll start to bleed and degrade the image. The vectorscope is divided into 6 parts represented by the base colors: red, magenta, blue, cyan, green, yellow. The closer to the outer edge a spike is, the more saturated that particular color is. There's also a line between the red and yellow sections that is a guide for human skin tone. If you're color correcting a frame where a large portion of the frame is a human face, that line will help you keep the skin tones correct.  RGB parade is like a waveform monitor, but it breaks up the luminance values for the red, green, and blue channels separately in case you need to just adjust the luminance of a particular channel.  A histogram is another way of viewing luminance similar to the levels effect in Photoshop. It's a good way of seeing the overall dynamic range of luminance in the clip."
editors,3776he,Iggapoo,1 point,Mon May 25 16:45:49 2015 UTC,I suppose let's start with 0 being absolute black (however its 7.5 in broadcast space) and 100 being white. Skin tone should fall around 45. It's a plot of brightness levels across the frame. Used to compare contrast and make sure that you are using the full extent of your dynamic range OR not - but in control of your contrast.   Vectorscope is better used for color and saturation.
editors,3776he,cineblast,1 point,Mon May 25 15:01:24 2015 UTC,Parade is useful especially for channel noise and color balance. Also for verifying color separation for chroma key

editors,3776he,Kichigai,2,Thu May 28 15:04:26 2015 UTC,"Couple of tips with that:   Unless you're shooting for slow-mo always shoot at the speed you intend to finish at. If you are shooting for slow-mo then shoot at a percentage of what you're aiming for, relative to delivery. So if you want 50% slow-mo and you're delivering 24p, then shoot at 48p. Unless you're in Europe, or using very specifically sourced footage, never use X.00 frame rates. 25.00 is the only non-fractional frame rate you should use. When you see 30p it usually means 29.97 and 60p means 59.94, because this is the actual frame rate TVs run at. 24p also typically means 23.976, and 48p is twice that. Going from 29.97 to 30.00 can cause visual issues."

Lines and refresh rate of article  NTSC:       NTSC color encoding is used with the System M television signal, which consists of 29.97 interlaced frames of video per second. Each frame is composed of two fields, each consisting of 262.5 scan lines, for a total of 525 scan lines. 483 scan lines make up the visible raster. The remainder (the vertical blanking interval) allow for vertical synchronization and retrace. This blanking interval was originally designed to simply blank the receiver's CRT to allow for the simple analog circuits and slow vertical retrace of early TV receivers. However, some of these lines may now contain other data such as closed captioning and vertical interval timecode (VITC). In the complete raster (disregarding half lines due to interlacing) the even-numbered scan lines (every other line that would be even if counted in the video signal, e.g. {2, 4, 6, ..., 524}) are drawn in the first field, and the odd-numbered (every other line that would be odd if counted in the video signal, e.g. {1, 3, 5, ..., 525}) are drawn in the second field, to yield a flicker-free image at the field refresh frequency of approximately 59.94 Hz (actually 60 Hz/1.001).

I am basically finding the clips for Avid and then it's like ""oh that clip?"", but I'm using the info inside the avid to find the clips in the first place.   It has to do with the way Avid handles AMA clips under the hood.  The reason Avid can relink to everything it ingests so cleanly is because of the media databases it manages. However AMA Media does not go into the Media Databases. That information lives exclusively in the bin and a couple peripheral files stored elsewhere. Since a bin itself is a discrete file, existing entirely on its own, Avid doesn't know what's in there until the bin is opened and loaded into memory. Now, you could say, ""why doesn't Avid just check every bin?"" Because of limitations with accessing lots of tiny files on most file systems, relinking would take much longer as it opened and scanned each bin. Not only that, but in the process it would have to link to all the media and ensure that it fits the parameters you need (which means loading additional media access libraries). Then there are questions about bins originating from outside the project, or bins that have potentially been deleted."
editors,378pql,ovideos,1 point,Tue May 26 15:05:09 2015 UTC,"Right.  I understand all that actually.   But that doesn't mean Avid couldn't automate the process more.  The clips in my offline(DNx36) bin do contain all the info needed to find the AMA clips - so the info is in the media database and/or in my bin.  I feel like Avid should have a process where it goes hunting based on ""source path"" and ""file name"" and relinks accordingly when everything matches (TC if it exists, filename, duration, and path name).      I am always a little annoyed when I am doing something with a computer that is simple and repetitive.  I generally feel that is what computers were built for.  EDIT:  I should note Avid does seemingly have this functionality, but it doesn't work.  I always have to use ""selected clips"".  I would almost prefer is there was a ""relink tool"" that showed offline clips and you could tell it where to search, sort of like ""batch import""."

The tape name is associated with the ama clip in your bin, right?  But the avid does not ""remember"" the information if you re ama a clip.  So you still need to open all the bins to get the avid to understand that tape ""xyz"" leads to folder ""xyz""?  What I'm curious about is does it actually aid in relinking?  If not, what is the use?"

editors,378pql,ovideos,1 point,Tue May 26 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have no problem relinking to online AMA clips without tape names.  By ""online"" I mean the clips are online.  Generally I've found a few bins (for whatever reason, generally someone moved the folder) won't find the original files and the ama clips will show up offline.  Then I have to re-ama those clips which causes the ones in the bin to come online.  Then the ""relink to selected"" works a charm - very few problems.  For all my bitching, I have to admit that once you link to an AMA file I've had almost zero problems with it relinking incorrectly or not understanding the file path or things like that.    It is ""robust"" so to speak, just often a bit of a PIA.  EDIT:  My clip names are unchanged though.  Perhaps there is some truth to the ""don't rename"" your clips?  Or perhaps setting Tape alleviates this?  Would be worth checking out.  I  would like to rename my clips, but the last sort of ""full time"" job I had, the online guys told me over and over and over again that it does screw up the relinking.   And since then I've never had the time to play around and test out the pros/cons."
editors,378pql,dmizz,1 point,Tue May 26 17:56:27 2015 UTC,"Well like I said, if each AMA clip and transcoded file have matching tape name and timecode they will relink regardless of clip name."

Obviously can't be done in a feature with a talking actor.  You didn't shoot in 24, so as soon as you have any motion in the frame or the camera itself moves, you are in deep trouble converting 30 to 24. Not to mention that shutter speed and other factors are not ""cinematic"" to begin with.  The cheapo frame-blending method produces ugly ghosting, simply dropping frames creates jerky motion.  FCPX/Motion has a feature called optical flow that can produce good results, takes ages to render, but kinda predicts movement of pixels and creates actually new frames in the process. Software such as Twixtor can do the same.  However, all that software trickery doesn't work for all shots equally well, maybe give it a try and see if it does in your case.  There is no mathematical, proper way to convert 30 to 24, so there is no perfect solution for it."
editors,376k69,zipfe,1 point,Mon May 25 08:50:06 2015 UTC,Optical Flow can work. It's a hit or miss depending on the source material.  I used it for a single camera on a multi camera shoot and it was almost unnoticeable.  It takes FOREVER to render.

Interlaced versus progressive is a big factor as well. If your source footage is interlaced, then a better way to describe it would be 60i. Convert it to progressive (usually by an effect that duplicates the first field onto the second) and your new 30p footage looks way more cinematic than 60i, and is pretty close to 24p.   Avid has film cadence effects like FluidFilm that can take 60i footage and reinterpolate it to new 24p frames, though this comes at a cost of about a minute of render time per 3 seconds of video IIRC. They guys here actually showed me a better workaround using Avid's timewarp effect that essentially duplicates the fields, and is a real-time effect; no rendering needed.  I know you're not on Avid, but hopefully this points you in a good direction for Premiere."

Having said that, an overclocked fx-8370 (a.k.a. fx-9590) is coming in about 10% below that badass i7 on cpubenchmark.net.

I recently purchased a GTX 970 to help improve performance in Premiere and Resolve, but I was disappointed when I saw my CPU maxing out and my GPU barely being utilized. I have an i5 2500k, which can be easily overclocked and I've been considering going this route.  One thing I did notice is that decoding MOV is incredibly more CPU intensive than MXF in Resolve. Using Prores 4444 files with a few blur nodes and grading gave me pretty slow performance and about 20% GPU usage with maxed CPU. When I made these files DNxHR 444, my CPU usage went down to 50% and my GPU bumped up to about 50%. I've settled at the moment with caching my footage as I grade for realtime performance, but overclocking would be really useful when creating proxies or simply opting to work with native media. This post is definitely pushing me in that direction."
editors,376i0c,greenysmac,2,Tue May 26 16:36:45 2015 UTC,"Very interesting.  Watch your temps if you go that route, obviously.  I'll note that I did try overclocking my old fx-6200 a little (maybe 400mhz or so), and it didn't have trouble with the heat using the stock air cooler.  But that's obviously a much different processor than yours.  Also, even if you assume a perfectly proportional speed increase via overclocking, 10% extra speed might not be worth reduced reliability.  If you do make some changes, I'd love to see data similar to the graphs I linked to - I'm itching to know about how Intel processors differ from my experience, since I'll definitely go Intel when I do a more full upgrade in 1-3 years.

Secondly it's usually a term given to rebuilding your edit of a sequence or program ""over"" a reference video track. You'll do this if you have timecode or conform issues, or are getting assembly edits with no timecode from producers, or you're switching NLEs. Because of the complexity of the issue, workflow will vary from situation to situation, but generally you have a reference video on v1/a1 and then match cut original footage on v2/a2+ to rebuild the edit."
editors,375jad,kissmyrobot,5,Mon May 25 02:26:31 2015 UTC,"Are you familiar with offline/online workflow? If not look it up.

editors,375jad,dmizz,2,Mon May 25 04:40:33 2015 UTC,"If someone asked you to overcut a sequence with grouped footage because they started working without groups (or for any other reason) you should be cutting the newer footage over the old footage. You want to match tape, camera, take and timecode so that the overcut sequence matches the original exactly."
editors,375jad,elriggo44,1 point,Mon May 25 04:04:59 2015 UTC,"Overcutting is also used in any type of editing where stock footage is being used - I've worked on several historical documentary shows where it's a common process. Essentially, when editors cut a show that uses stock footage, they cut using low-res versions of shots that often have timecode burn-in on them. That's to save media storage space in offline and also to save the production money - stock footage costs a lot, so buying the largest quantity as screeners and then only buying what's used in the final edit as master footage is the way a lot of productions go. So after the sequence is locked, you'd be given the master stock footage for the show, and you'd cut it in overtop of the editor's sequence. You have to match the shot & timecode exactly, so that the master shots you cut it are identical to the low-res screener shots - just in better quality. It's time consuming, but quite satisfying once it's done!"
editors,375jad,cleoola,1 point,Mon May 25 20:11:48 2015 UTC,"It's rebuilding an edit from newer footage, often times because the timecode doesn't match and the process can't be automated.  For example, back in the day when you would receive tap feeds from the camera on set to speed up the editing process, and assistant would have to overcut the footage on top of the editors tap feed cut.  The process couldn't be automated because tap feeds had no timecode (as it had no been generated yet).  Those days are mostly over.  But sometimes timecode is messed up and the process is required. Often times, it's stock footage, VFX shots, anything that wasn't from the original shoot.  It's usually done to either conform/online footage yourself, or to prep and cut accurately so the online process can be done faster by professional artists (an AE's time is worth much less than an online artist's time)."

Once on a TV show, make your desire to become an editor well known to the producers of the show. Ask them for an opportunity to practice cutting media before or after your shifts, and dedicate time and energy to learning the process.   Ask these producers to watch your cuts and give feedback. Accept this feedback, ask questions, and then adapt your cut to this feedback the best way you can. This is the very same process you'll experience as an editor, and this is invaluable to jumping to the next level.  As shows get picked up for more episodes, some editors move on, while others may become too expensive. It's only a matter a time before a producer will start to see you as someone who can not only cut, but can also be a less expensive option at the beginning of your editing career.

Would you say no at $90 but yes at $100? This is a gauge of your interest. Would you do it for only $100? What do you guess they'll pay? Let's say it's $110. If you're going to charge $200 (because that's how much you can get paid to do something else) and tell them that- you're risking the chance that they'll say no. They'll say ""Oh, I'd only pay $110."" Since it's the value about step 2, you'd say yes to the work.

That's half my problem and the reason I'm struggling to find help :\  The quality preset is the other half of the problem. Going from medium to slow causes the live streaming software to report ""High CPU usage! Skipping frames"", but only the first CPU is being used. In x264 CLI, it slows down. Instead of utilizing the 2nd CPU, it just maxes out the first and drops frames - which is my whole problem.  The color conversion thing I'm not too concerned about, but am willing to look into. Setting everything to full range both on the capture card and in the software really had no effect on core usage, so I haven't done any other testing with it."
editors,36x1ds,JiggyStash,6,Fri May 22 20:41:24 2015 UTC,"Pitch, in audio, is a function of that sound's frequencies; a measurement that is made in the time domain, and it's that change in frequency that cause our ears to decipher different pitches.  To time stretch, you're changing the time domain, you're directly affecting the measured frequency.  There are lots of charts and calculators to deal with this. http://www.thewhippinpost.co.uk/tools/tempo-pitch-calculator.htm for instance, even though it abstracts speed changes as two ""beats per minute"" measurements which are common in relating music tempo.  Doubling or halving speed will give you an octave change http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave but semitones aren't as easy to calculate (at least not without a little more multiplication). Western music uses equal temperament so the ratio in these changes compared to the change in interval of the octave will remain constant as well."

Sure, you've tried certain things - if you're coming here, and I can't see the system, I'm looking for you to do methodical exact things.  Yes, you might have done some/all of them before. But the order I'm going in is a precise method of solving the problem.   I totally get you're frustrated. I know because I've been there a thousand times. I get up in front of user groups and play ""Stump the Chump"" and try and solve people's system problems off the cuff.   That doesn't matter - you only know me as some dude on reddit.   Hey, we all have our ""voodoo"" of how to fix/troubleshoot. Sometimes it's the gut ""Oh, there's a problem? Trash the preferences.""    But, we move to the methodical methods when our common voodoo doesn't work.  So, I'm going to come back to my first thing I asked: would you test the problem solely off your system with nothing other than the matrox output hardware connected? Have the media attached on the internal drive?   That will show if it's one of the drives, the caldigit, the thunderbolt or rule those out.    Ok, while writing this post, I had a bizarre insight that hit my brain: do you have any hardware on the firewire bus right now? FireWire will step down to the slowest speed on a bus. IF you have a DV Deck which is firewire 100 over the 400 or the 800 connection, it will cause media from the bus (everything on a mac without a separate spare firewire card) to slow down.  You might have a DV deck attached even though you haven't used it in a year - but that might cause a problem like this.  This is just a gut guess. My first step is still my first step. This was just a gut, obscure piece of knowledge that would cause a problem like this."

(And then of course also fade the video transparency. This is probably not the most elegant solution but it would achieve what your going for.  If you don't want to deal with track matting, stack duplicate layers of the video, roto out the bright areas you want and fade their transpernecy at a different rate than the rest (this time it would be from 100-0 so the white underneath shows through).

It's just there for the ""Buy me a Beer"" button on the ""Support me"" page (which is found in a menu, not a nag screen). The software is 100% donationware, and doesn't even feature ads.  Timesheet lets you punch in and punch out, with various options for rounding time up or down, estimating the amount of pay due per project, ""closing"" projects, backup to internal storage and Dropbox, an area for both notes on what you did and notes for that particular session, lets you tag what you've done, track where you were working, and export reports to either CSV or Excel files, with a whole multitude of options and filters to control what it exports and how.  And if that wasn't awesome enough, there are add-ons to extend the app even further. My favorite is the NFC Add-On which lets you program an NFC tag to punch you in and out of a particular project. So when we were busy I could just wave my phone over a little tag to punch out of one project and punch into another one, and all I had to do was make sure my screen was on, no further intervention required.  There's also the Calendar Exporter, which punts your records over to Google Calendar, and the Locale/Tasker Add-On, which lets you automate punching in and out, and taking a break, using (of course) Tasker or Locale conditions.

I'm terrible at keeping time sheets and I'm often juggling multiple jobs at once, so finding an app that can automatically track open apps/project files was very important to me.  Unfortunately there isn't a one stop solution. Timingapp (as mentioned above) is good at tracking Premiere projects, but sucks at After Effects. Time Sink can track both, but its interface is clunky and hard to work with. I'm trying to get an automated spreadsheet working that can process the exported data into an easily usable form, but I'm no Excel master, so its taking a bit of time.  There are a few web based time tracking solutions, but most of them failed to track both Premiere or After Effects at a project level (telling me that I spent 5 hours in Ae is useless if I don't know what projects I was working on).  Unfortunately most of the native apps are undercooked and not really under much ongoing development. The online ones probably have a better chance of getting updates to do what we want, but I'm not really keen on sharing that much information with a third party, nor am I prepared to pay monthly subscription fees (which seems to be where most of them are heading).

Everyone has their own situation and their own way of doing things that works best for them and their clients.  I sometimes bill hourly, daily, weekly or on a per project basis. It depends on the job and the client. Sometimes it's their preference and sometimes it's mine. So long as I'm happy with the pay, there's no right or wrong way of going about it.  But I'm not going to turn down a paying job because I prefer hourly billing and they want a day rate (or per project fee). That's just silly. Part of the risk of being freelance is that there's always someone else waiting in the wings if the client doesn't like your terms. We have some power, but not all.  Unless you're drowning in work, you don't always have the option of turning jobs down.  Thankfully I'm drowning in work at the moment, but they wasn't always the case."

Freelance isn't for-hire employment. It's not a leapfrog from paycheck to paycheck.  You are a business, and when you act like one, you get treated like one.  Your success is irrelevant, and not up to being challenged.   But straight truth; if you don't control the terms of your billing you don't control the course of your business.  and within the role of billing, you don't do hourly. You create custom products.

All music tracks are stereo but not stereo clips. I guess that makes them dual mono so maybe that's the trick.  I know I can adjust them in the timeline it's just frustrating to have to adjust all the clips all the time. This is the avg timeline I'm dealing with: My fingers are numb...

Once you've decided this, move on to constructing something that will make sense, then move on to adding new material to flesh out the narrative or to make it feel more ""doc""-y"
editors,36oogz,LocalMexican,1 point,Thu May 21 16:07:49 2015 UTC,"My problem is, I just can't figure out how you're supposed to turn fiction into documentary or documentary into fiction, especially with these films. I'm not asking for someone to come up with the idea or anything, I just need to know how this is supposed to be achieved, because my lecturers don't seem willing to tell me that.  I've never coped well with documentary/non-fiction so the assumption would be to go with doc -> fiction, but either way I'll have to work with documentary. However, I think the footage for the fiction is more feasible to be turned into documentary but I can't figure out how."
editors,36oogz,Nnata,3,Thu May 21 16:33:26 2015 UTC,You could add an Attenborough-style narration to the fiction piece.
editors,36ps1j,Tabula_Rastamon,1 point,Thu May 21 03:45:32 2015 UTC,Do you have any track effects on?  Perhaps a gate effect that is cutting off the softer opening dialog?
editors,36ps1j,agent42b,1 point,Thu May 21 11:04:40 2015 UTC,No track effects.  It was a very intermittent issue.  Seems to have gone away for the most part.  I'm wondering if it was just some sort of lag on our server end.
editors,36ps1j,Kichigai,1 point,Fri May 22 13:30:55 2015 UTC,I turns out it was the OS on our server.  OS X 10.9 with the Server app is no match for 10.6 Server (yes we'd prefer to use an isis but we're going xserve for this gig)

editors,36ngom,e_adams,4,Wed May 20 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"In theory, depending on the quality of your scaling method (whatever your NLE is using) there may be a slight quality hit, compared to rendering from the source to 1080p.    In reality, however, you are not going to notice.  You'd have to pixel-peep pretty intensively to see it. The difference is too small, and by the time you convert to your end-codec (whatever your broadcast codec is) the difference may be washed away entirely.    Any btw ... I think you mean ""UHD"" and not 4K.  Those are actually different formats, although I can already see they are going to get mixed up for years to come.  UHD = TV standard = 3840x2160.   4K = Film Aquisition format = 4096x2160."
editors,36ngom,agent42b,4,Wed May 20 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"4k is a fluid term used to refer to the amount of horizontal pixels.   I'm not disagreeing with you, I'm just addressing that UHD and DCI 4K, are still technically the same thing, and how 4k doesn't have an exact display resolution."
editors,36ngom,SlenderLlama,1 point,Wed May 20 22:56:04 2015 UTC,"Yes you're right, though Resolve and Avid clearly distinguish between ""UHD"" and ""4K"" in their resolution nomenclature.  I knew this stuff was bound to get mixed up for the next 10 years....one can wish it wasn't so."
editors,36ngom,agent42b,2,Thu May 21 14:27:21 2015 UTC,"I think your biggest issue will be with dealing with a 4K master edit and all the file size, bandwidth and processing power that requires. If you can handle that, I say go for it."
editors,36ngom,__dontpanic__,2,Wed May 20 18:38:26 2015 UTC,"I think that's a good idea. Keep in mind that ""4K"" is technically 4096*2160, which has an aspect ratio of ~1.9, whereas 1080p has an aspect ratio of ~1.78, so to preserve the aspect ratio when downscaling, you're going to have to crop out the sides slightly. Other than that, I don't really see any issues with downscaling as long as the image doesn't get incorrectly distorted in the process."
editors,36ngom,urbanplowboy,1 point,Wed May 20 18:40:17 2015 UTC,"Quick question (slightly unrelated,) isn't DCI 4k a container format made to crop to either 16:9, 1.85 or 2.40? I have never seen the full DCI aspect ratio besides Youtube as master out I believe.  I don't know if OP works in studio (because he said he does shows) but for what I know is that those studio cameras only do UHD (for workflow/live broadcasting.) At least for the cams I worked with"

If I were in your shoes, I'd forget about the degree and take the IT job. At night I would be studying After Effects/AVID/Premiere Pro like a crazy and seeing what kind of freelance work I can drum up to start building out a portfolio.

I'm nearby London, so commuting to the work is easy enough. But I think I'll apply for some IT jobs and get my skills up to scratch."

Bad underexposed footage, camera sound from a small rhode. Story kept changing. Contradictory edit notes. Poor crafty. Inexperienced producers. Etc.

editors,36grec,byahseeker,3,Tue May 19 20:13:24 2015 UTC,Any feature demands these types of hours   That's just not true.  I know that many productions actually care about the 12 hour guild day and stick to it.  I also know too many damned AEs and editors who don't bill for OT after 12.  If I'm on a guild show you'd better bet I'm charging for every second past 12 hours.  Thus I haven't worked over 12 hours in a day for almost 3 years now.  Some of my colleagues allow themselves to get pushed around and average 14 hour days - fuck that.  Every hour after 10 or 11 has massively diminishing returns.
editors,36grec,byahseeker,1 point,Tue May 19 21:34:28 2015 UTC,Ok...  Most tentpole features demand this...  Not all features but ones doing preview screenings weekly it's part of the game.  And I always get paid for all my hours.  Don't even fuck around with that madness.  Assistants are usually on a 50 hr week but since their rate is hourly it starts adding up quick.

In my opinion absolutely,  in my market scripted television and 95% of features are on some type of contract a very low amount of reality is union too.   The union scale rate isn't the rate you would have to accept it's simply the lowest you can be paid.  It's a pretty large upfront payment and then quarterly dues at about 200$ for assistants.   As an assistant I make more money being union than not, also every hour your work the producers pay money into a pension and they contribute to your healthcare.  All this is amazing if you can find consistent work.  I gather you are an editor as you have an agent?"

Yeah really, I mean if we're talking about actually editing all day (not interspersed with file management, meetings or other busywork), the quality of anything I do past 10 hours or so is going to start to dip and get exponentially slower and worse every hour.  I can't even imagine doing 20 hours unless it's a super tight deadline. Plus you're now burnt out for the next day or two and your work is going to continue to suffer the rest of the week. I'd rather have an editor come in and do 8-9 hours of great solid work and then go home and clear their head and get a good nights rest.  They're going to have a much better perspective and a lot more energy the next day, as opposed to having gone straight to bed from the office at 3am and then going straight back to work in the morning feeling like they never even left.

I understand keeping the structure. Sometimes its a hassle to dig a few folders deep to find what you're looking for. Some things we shoot can be used in other projects, (we're a non-profit) so I'm trying to find the best way to ingest/ rename then eventually tag in our management system."

The original files aren't touched, the database makes metadata searchable and points back to the original files. There's also a bridge between the MAM and the editor via a plugin, xml, etc. to allow clips to be sent from the MAM to the NLE. Does Axle do this?"

Sure, it's going to duplicate frames in your lower frame rate footage, but that's as good as you're going to get without interpolating, which would be a big time suck and doesn't always yield good results. That's if most of your footage is 29.97 or 30fps. If most is 24 or 25, I'd go with 24. The only thing I would look out for is to deinterlace any interlaced footage. Also, conform to 1080p, not 1080i."
editors,36hul0,urbanplowboy,1 point,Tue May 19 15:03:57 2015 UTC,"Oh good lord we aren't going to do any motion interpolation. I consider it a sin against media. The plan was to allow for proper 3:2 pulldown while allowing enough headroom in the frame rate that we could still squeeze in the 25p material (since some of this ends up coming from Europe) as well as any material with the pulldown already baked in (so I wouldn't have to remove the pulldown).   Also, conform to 1080p, not 1080i.   The destination format is a BluRay though, and I don't know how old the BluRay player is, or if it handles 1080p, or even if the projector can natively handle 1080p. I'm kind of rolling with the lowest common denominator at this point."
editors,36hul0,urbanplowboy,1 point,Tue May 19 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that 1080p is the blu-ray standard. I was also under the impression that all projectors (at least modern ones) display progressive images instead of interlaced ones. That's why I was suggesting deinterlacing everything and going 1080p, but now I see that 1080i projectors are definitely a thing. You know what your output requirements better than me, so ignore me if I'm wrong."

Some players and discs go beyond that, but those are the specs.  As far as interlaced projectors go, I suspect that's mostly a hang-over from 1080i/720p being the lowest common denominators for HDMI video.  It's possible both the player and the projector will handle 1080p29.97, but I don't really have access to either of them for testing, so I'm just going for the lowest common denominator rather than have the presenter show up with a disc they can't use and be forced to use the DVD backup."

Of course, getting mixed fps footage into Premiere is super easy too.  It's just that once it's on the timeline the results aren't always so nice.

editors,36dcpt,greenysmac,3,Mon May 18 14:13:30 2015 UTC,"I've been asked to edit together a photo slideshow with captions for a graduation next week. There are about 300 graduates. To make it shorter in duration, they want it to have two photos side by side with each senior's name at the bottom.  EDIT: They also want them to appear alphabetically, otherwise I would have just done two compositions and nested them in there. They have to be in alphabetical order.  So it would be easy to do this a pair at a time, but we're talking 300 students, so repeating the same editing task 150 times. I'm more of an automation guy. There has to be a better way.  I've already used an After Effects script to do all of the names/captions from a spreadsheet I made. I just need to figure out if there's an easier way to place photo 1 on the left, 2 on the right, then another screen with 3 on the left, 4 on the right, etc.  Any ideas? I have the entire Adobe CC 2014 suite of programs."
editors,36dcpt,psychosid,2,Mon May 18 19:15:18 2015 UTC,"Here's what I'm doing for now. Would love to hear about a better way. My 12 steps to success...   Used Adobe Lightroom to import the pictures and rename them so that there's a 3-digit number at the beginning of the filename, such as 001 Jane Doe.JPG, 002 John Smith.JPG, etc. Used Excel to take that list of files and break it down into number, name, in separate columns of data. Created a dummy composition in After Effects and made dummy text layers with exactly half of the number of students. Duplicated this composition. So now I have two compositions -- each with about 150 layers of dummy text, formatted properly. Used Text2Spreadsheet from aescripts.com to export the text layers to two spreadsheets: one for odd, one for even. In Excel, I had the program separate the list so that the odd numbers went into one list and the evens into another, with the names. With the spreadsheet from Text2Spreadsheet, I added a replacement column for the Odd comp and the Even comp so that the dummy text was replaced with the Odd and Even filename lists, respectively. Imported the spreadsheet back into After Effects using Text2Spreadsheet. So now I have two compositions of text layers, each with about 150 names. Made each layer 6 seconds, used Keyframe Assistant to cross-dissolve the layers. Made new comps for Even Pics and Odd Pics, put the pictures in the respective composition, trimmed to 6 seconds, and used Keyframe Assistant again to cross-dissolve them. Now I have four total compositions: odd text, odd pics, even text, even pics. Nested all four sequences together into a final composition. Moved them around so that you can see both pics and captions side by side. BAM! Alphabetical photo slideshow of about 300 students in ""two-up"" formation. Took about 2 hours total time."

I'm coming off a different show (which had less GoPros) where we would AMA transcode the GoPro. The AMA plugin would generate a TC in Avid, which was extremely helpful to figure out sync. The workflow on the new show so far has been to convert all the GoPros to MXF outside of Avid with Episode Engine and then fast import the converted MXFs.  While this workflow is definitely faster than AMA transcoding, we end up losing the TC.     Current thinking is using QTchange to add a TC track to the GoPros and then converting through Episode.

I doubt it'll be a thing of the future. There are so many situations where you just don't need it, and having the flexibility of owning your own hardware goes very far. That being said it won't be going away. There is a niche that uses it, but I would expect that like everything else the price will start to fall over time."
editors,36dcpt,Kichigai,0,Mon May 18 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of the now defunct service OnLive.  Let's see: Remotely, you would need a regular computer that meets the system requirements of your NLE of choice. That computer would be headless, xunless it was located in a physical office you need to visit every now and then.  Assuming a single wide-screen UI (1920x1080), you would need to enable a second monitor to be mirrored by physically connecting onto the HDMI port of the video card or by having a DVI splitter.  You would then need a second computer system or a hardware encoder, that takes the mirror monitor 1080 feed, and converts it to something usable for streaming at a reasonable bitrate (2MBps perhaps)  You will then need a third system that handles all the remote input. It would pass your keystrokes/mouse clicks onto the remote editing system, and the UI would update along with the video being fed back to you.  Just like screen capture programs do, you would ideally have a custom program that only encodes and sends for streaming the actual changes happening on the screen, so that your bandwidth is optimized and there is little lag on your end.  I am probably missing something but off the top of my head that's about it. Oh, and security of course. Yet another system to handle credentials and logins."

Wat. Why? If the system is headless why would it need to do display mirroring?   You would then need a second computer system or a hardware encoder, that takes the mirror monitor 1080 feed, and converts it to something usable for streaming   No you wouldn't. Most modern GPUs and some CPUs have hardware H.264 encoders built in. There's Intel Quick Sync, AMD VCE, and Nvidia NVENC. So you can do all your H.264 encoding right in the GPU, no external hardware required!   a reasonable bitrate (2MBps perhaps)   I think you and I have different definitions of ""reasonable."" I'd wager you'd need at least 6MbPS for a good quality stream, since we're talking about a lot of little details here (text). But since Netflix bangs out that every day I don't think it would be a problem.   You will then need a third system that handles all the remote input. It would pass your keystrokes/mouse clicks onto the remote editing system, and the UI would update along with the video being fed back to you.   No you wouldn't. This has been done in software for eons with utilities like with VNC, Apple Remote Desktop, Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connection, Steam In-Home Streaming, and Nvidia GameStream. This part of the deal is wholly trivial. Even if you needed to do something to fool the OS for whatever reason (I can't imagine why) it's pretty trivial to create a virtual USB device (which is how disk images work, as well how pirates were able to circumvent Avid's dongle security).   Just like screen capture programs do, you would ideally have a custom program that only encodes and sends for streaming the actual changes happening on the screen, so that your bandwidth is optimized and there is little lag on your end.   Not really. Nvidia is already leading the way on this one.   Oh, and security of course. Yet another system to handle credentials and logins.   Another trivial field. In the corporate IT world Directory Services handle all that stuff, but you could easily run it locally on the main machine. For a long while I was running a VPN server off of my Raspberry Pi model B so I could remote into my home network. Or you could also easily do tunneling over SSH. And given that a good number of CPUs on the market today have AES-NI instructions the performance hit for encryption is next to nothing.  But here's the thing: you don't need any of this. As I understand it the Adobe and Avid ""cloud"" editing solutions involve a client that runs on your machine. To the end-user it functions just like editing on their local machine, except all the content is coming over the Internet instead of from a hard disk. Commands for processing are sent to the remote server via an API, and proxy quality video is sent back whenever a clip or render is called for."

It's a bit hard to do this because the whole point of the X system was to bolt a DAM onto the editorial engine but NOT to force the user to set up the DAM in any particular way. That's the power of X's range based keywording. You set a range, then YOU get to tag it with whatever makes the most sense to YOU in the context of what you are trying to do. For example, I do a lot of commercial voice overs. And I use the database in X to rank my takes with stupidly simple A-B-C grades. I can't tell you how many times I've ended up with just one identified ""A"" take from each paragraph in a 5 paragraph script where I've recorded half a dozen reads - and by just clicking on the A keyword collection - selecting the sorted list - and tapping E to magnetically assemble the result, I've had a spot assembled that was close to final.  Or in a complex video with thousands of clips, to see a pretty reaction shot go by of the character in the yellow dress, and even tho that scene and take is already tagged with scene numbers and reel locations and and tracked by the dialog. I'll just add ""pretty"" or ""yellow girl"" or smile or something meaningful to me alone as a quick additional tag , and the moment I do - I know I OWN access to that shot and the second I want to try it somewhere, I know I can do so in literally one second. And because the tagging system works in conjunction  with the magnetic timeline, trying the shot in context is literally instantaneous, and if it doesn't work, undo is totally self repairing and I don't lose ANY time before I go on.  X is a system. Not just a collection of isolated editing features that can be understood one by one. And especially by comparing it's features to the ones in NLEs you may already know. Sorry for the wall of text. But I do LOVE this software because it's made my editing practice so very much easier. YMMV."

When you go back days later to find the section where he talks about his family, you just click on the ""Family"" keyword in your bin, and it will only display the subclips that he talked about his family in. It will also show the sections from your other 5 interviews where they talked about their family.  Sure, you could make a ""Family"" timeline in another NLE, but this is messy, slow, and not searchable. And who wants 20 timelines for the 20 subjects your interviewees are talking about? Much nicer to have keyword bins.  And that's not even touching on smart collections which will automatically pull in subclips or clips based on specific metadata. Want clips where interview subjects are talking about family and cooking? How about one that pools together all the still images in a project? Or all the multicam clips? Or all the synchronized clips from Bob's interview? The possibilities are pretty much endless for organization because a single clip can be in hundreds of places at once if you want it to be.

But again -- I can use the ""Find"" function in Avid and (assuming I've used my spanned markers) can come up with a very similar system.  You don't actually have to make sequences or sub clips to organize your stuff.    Again though -- I think the way other NLEs have this feature implemented makes it less natural to use and not nearly as efficient.    I'm definitely going to give FCPX yet another try at some point in the future.  You've got me thinking about it again.

There's no equivalent part of X's ability to add the video and/or audio into the program stream magnetically knowing that there's no chance that anything you do will mess up your current edit. No track targeting. No need to ensure that the incoming audio won't destroy your existing audio if you don't make space on the downstream tracks. You just insert and watch the result. If you like it, you can leave it or refine it. If you don't like it, remove the addition and the entire timeline magnetically repairs itself.  Again, if all you do is compare features in isolation - ""ranges are like spanned markers"" you're missing the big picture. Remember, what bothered so many about what Apple did with X was that they tore it down to the very foundations to rebuild a whole new approach - that was the point. Instead if bolting a feature here (spanned markers) or a feature there (hover scrub) into an existing editing process, they had the rare chance to ask fundamental questions like ""if the camera creates one digital file with audio and video in sync- why do I need TWO areas separated by an arbitrary line to display the files?"" And ""traditionally video goes up above and audio goes down below, but WHY? If I have the SFX of the glass breaking, why can't the sound be attached directly adjacent to the picture?  X was really a response to hundreds of questions like this in an environment where the one response that was considered too weak to pass muster was ""because it's always been done that way up to now."" You may not understand or just be happy with the new thinking, and that's fine. But after 4 solid years of development most of which ahead been centered on truly professional level features for working editors. It's now very silly in my opinion to try to support any view of the reboot other then with the argument that 1990s style NLE designs, constantly refined, is the only best answer to the wholesale industry shifts we face. It's a metadata soaked - file based and increasingly mobile world out there. Everyone knows that. So protecting too much of the processes we've inherited from the old analog days with the rigid comfort of tracks and virtualized bins seems silly. Not when magnetic storylines and databases can be so much more efficient. The problem is it requires editors to change. And I appreciate how hard that can be. But it is possible. And it sometimes that change can really energize an editor. It did for me. YMMV."
editors,36avzk,agent42b,2,Mon May 18 18:58:30 2015 UTC,"But you don't have the second part of the system..No track targeting...destroy your existing audio...If you don't like it, remove the addition   I guess this is part of why it hasn't seemed such a big deal to me.  I'm an expert Avid editor, and track targeting and sync has never been an issue (to be clear, it was an issue when I first learning avid, but that was eons ago and I am fully comfortable with that system).  If this is indeed the holy grail of the feature-set, than I suppose it isn't a big deal to me.  I can, however, see that it would be important to many editors who haven't learned/done that system for years and years until it's become muscle memory.    If I have the SFX of the glass breaking, why can't the sound be attached directly adjacent to the picture?   This is a good point, but again, I am not really concerned about clip connections.  It's a ""nice to have"" -- but I ran into an equal number of scenarios where that wasn't favourable.  Well.. favourable is too strong a word .... it just wasn't all that useful one way or another to me.     It's a metadata soaked    Right, but again, all the NLEs are.  This is really not a unique feature.  FCPX makes using the metadata faster though, I contend.     it requires editors to change   I don't mind change.  I embrace it.  But I have yet to see FCPX truly sail from start to FINSIH.  There are a few features I feel are lacking to truly fine-cut/trim my edits.  I wouldn't be first to say this -- https://library.creativecow.net/lawrence_david/Magnet-Timeline/1  Either way I am definitely giving this another try."
editors,36avzk,newvideoaz,1 point,Mon May 18 22:57:24 2015 UTC,"I have no quarrel with anything you say. Someone who has mastered a tool has every reason to want to keep using that tool. That's just common sense. My only observation would be the internet signature that crossed my view many years ago about how when the tool you are holding is a hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail. I too solved ALL my editing problems with a traditional NLE for 14 years. FCP Legacy in my case. And I was largely content as well. Discovering X rattled my cage and upended my sense of complacency. It required me to really stretch my thinking into new directions and opened up new possibilities. Looking back from 4 years on, I'm grateful that happened. Because where I am is quite a bit superior (for me) to where I was back then. I think differently about editing now. It's freer and more fun for me. I try more because the penalty for experimentation is so low in the magnetic world of X. But that says nothing about the experience any other editor will have. C'est la vie!"
editors,36avzk,agent42b,2,Wed May 20 22:49:08 2015 UTC,Well I updated to OSX 10.10 yesterday (new version of FCPX needs it... didn't know!) and have reinstalled it (FCPX) too.  See what you've done?  Now I'll spend the next 6 months dabbling in my spare time :p
editors,36avzk,newvideoaz,1 point,Thu May 21 14:20:09 2015 UTC,"I hope you find it more interesting this time. I'd have two small suggestions for you if I might. The first is to IGNORE the timeline for your first month. Instead, concentrate on exploring the database. Read up on the X Favorite/Reject system. It ROCKS. Next, explore how in the X system you can actually pre-edit content (with frame accurate precision) in the event browser. Learn to set ranges. It can be like JKL pre-editing if you are a keyboard focused editor. Resist the temptation to just ""rough range"" your selections. If you know the scene needs to start after ""action"" AND after the actor takes the big breath - mark THAT as your range in. Sure you can change any in point  in the storyline and trim to your hearts content, but why set the scene in point  (or out point!) twice if you don't have to? Next, build a personal strategy for tagging. X lets you use anything. Numbers, symbols, words, combinations, whatever - as tags. Think about how that affects what YOU edit most. Do you want to search and sort by character names? Script line numbers? Or something else? Definitely read up on smart collections! A HUGE X timesaver! Only then should you open a storyline and start making projects. If you are like most X editors, what's going to happen is that the better the work you do in the Event Browser - the easier creating the timeline you want becomes. Sometimes SCARY easier. IMO, the reason a lot of editors try X and don't have much success is that they try to drive it like a traditional NLE. I get that. Heck, what else does anyone expect? It's how we think about what editing is! But it's NOT what X is. Let it be what it is. Learn about that. And you might be very pleasantly surprised. Again, sorry for the wall of text. And good luck."

editors,36avzk,jonjiv,1 point,Mon May 18 15:11:51 2015 UTC,"You might already be doing this, but when I have a lot of interviews, I first watch each interview at 2x speed and keyword the sections that I think might be useable by the subject they are talking about. If a section has multiple subjects, I put it in multiple keyword collections. Once I've gotten through all the interviews, I now automatically have everyone's comments about similar subjects grouped together, which makes the first cut super easy.   I'll sometimes even go as far as outlining the keywords in FCPX before I make the first cut. This makes the A-roll rough cut practically done before you even start editing!"
editors,36avzk,jonjiv,2,Mon May 18 01:07:20 2015 UTC,"I'm doing essentially this!  I have each person's interview in their own project. I watch at double speed and blade out the parts that work, I duplicate them right above then marry all the edits into compound clips at the end of the timeline. That clip gets titled with the interviewee's name and a brief description.  I have smart keyword groups that look for the interviewee name so they aggregate automatically. From the description, I add in keywords so that I can see relevant clips from every interviewee on each topic."
editors,36avzk,assesasinassassin,1 point,Mon May 18 01:51:13 2015 UTC,"Ah. I think I like your method a bit better, especially if you end up with a ton of subjects. You can just search for a subject matter instead of scanning through a hundred keyword collections.   I use my approach for pretty short videos (less than 10 min, but sometimes upwards of 15 interviews), so it's not bad if they're only taking about a handful of things.   I work straight out of the event browser instead of using projects. Only thing you lose there is the ability to compound your clips."

It can only access 4GB of RAM, it has no GPU acceleration, and its multithreading is atrocious. Either Premiere or Avid will give you a huge boost in productivity on a properly spec'd system.   Mainly it overheats big time and lags.   Have you cleaned the machine out at all? That could partially be due to the heat sink being clogged with dust. And at the age of your laptop it's also a possibility that all the mojo is gone from the thermal paste that's bonding your CPU and GPU to the heat pipe that feeds the heat sink. That's a bit of an involved process, but it could help squeeze a little more life out of your laptop as a backup machine (or just a portable convenience machine).   Also three times in the past few months it has given me the flashing question mark folder of doom when booting up, it makes me nervous that it's been having so many issues finding the startup disk, though it hasn't been hard to fix.   If you've never replaced it before, your hard disk is dying (and likely is the cause of your crashes), and I'd replace that ASAP. I mean like right now. It's not too insanely hard to do yourself, though you could easily find a local repair shop to do it for you. I wouldn't have Apple do it, as their repair fees are totally outrageous, like $200+ for a simple swap, where as a local repair shop could probably even upgrade your storage capacity or speed and still cost less.  The trick is in transferring everything from one disk to another, but if you have a Time Machine backup of your computer (and if not you really should anyway) and the original discs that came with your disk you can easily do it in the Migration Assistant.   I also would really like to have the support that comes with buying a premade product, since my expertise is not really with hardware.   Well, if you can part with OS X then you can get pretty good support from HP or Dell using one of their workstations.

Researching a bit more, I don't think you can get a single 6 core Mac Pro, but I'm not absolutely certain. You could absolutely have dual socket motherboards with only one CPU populated with Dell / HP servers at this time, and they all use the same chipsets (albeit very different motherboards than the Mac Pro).

Look into your footage, even those moments before and after action/cut, for any blinks, winks, cringes, sniffles, and use those to flesh out the moment beyond what was shot to try to recover the impact of the line. Also helps to cover the line off camera.    If it's hardly repairable, start trimming down. It's not worth including much if it does the film injustice.  Good luck, Doctor."
editors,366u7g,swob,2,Sat May 16 18:57:45 2015 UTC,Mainly one particular scene - a dramatic argument - and things are feeling a bit cringey. I've mainly cut light drama/comedy narratives before so keeping things serious is a bit of a tough one here.
editors,366u7g,Tasty_Freeze,8,Sat May 16 19:57:25 2015 UTC,A badly acted line sounds tons better off screen. I've had the same problem with bad extras who have to much dialogue. Try to use the ok parts and cut to a reaction shot over the next part of the line.

editors,366u7g,AlvinBlah,1 point,Sun May 17 19:05:09 2015 UTC,"Before getting my current job, I spent years learning about all the intricacies of scene work, acting etc. here are my tips which you are free to take or leave-   I would get out of the habit of thinking about it as ""bad acting."" It may very well be, but it's also your name on the line and the first thing any actor/director will do if the scene doesn't work is say the editor didn't use the right takes. Make the quality of the scene something that is personal/important for you.  The most frequent and most effective trick I had to turn a bad scene into a good one was to use a ""series of looks."" This is when you cut back and forth between CUs of actors being silent in order to create a sense of depth/meaning that may or may not have been there in the day. Scenes have what are called 'beats.' These are moments in the scene where the actor/character is making a thought change or changing their tactic to get what they want. Scenes can have multiple beats, but in my experience most scenes have one major beat. If you can sell that one moment the audience will forgive most of what happens around it. If the actor(s) don't sell the moment or the director was inept or whatever you can cheat a series of silent looks between the actors that communicates what should be going on during the major beat of the scene. You can also use this trick to get rid of any ""bad"" dialogue.  It's surprisingly easy to map dialogue from different takes under each other. For example, let's say visually the performance is good in take 3, but the delivery of the line is best in take 4. Let's say the line is ""I am Over this""- you match the ""O"" part from take 4 up with the ""O"" part from take 3 and even if the rest doesn't line up because the actors mouth is open so wide on the ""O"" most people won't even notice.   Remember how I mentioned beats? If you have a scene that's really terrible cut out all the silences/pauses between the actors and just leave a moment between them during the major beat of the scene. Maybe it won't be great, but it won't be long and the major idea/contribution that the scene has to the whole will still be intact. I'm saying do this in case of a bad scene, but honestly I've used this on good scenes that were working as is and it made them 10 times better.  Also, this is important, don't tell anyone you did any of this. The minute a director hears you used trickery to make a scene better they go into fragile ego mode and insist everything be cut straight forward. If everything works and they like it, just let them think it was all them. They'll think more highly of you in the long run."

The movement will mask some of the acting.  The other thing to do is use script sync for the argument scene.

Then you can butcher the dialogue yourself and fix the timing, without worrying about jumpcuts. You can also re-shoot with the same actor, or another, give their lines to someone else.

editors,366zou,TheJaguar77,6,Sat May 16 19:42:04 2015 UTC,"You can for sure move the  project folder from one location to another. What do you mean it won't open? What happens?  The project is just a folder with a .avp (avid project) file, .avs (avid settings) file, .xml file, and then apart from those it's a direct copy of the file structure you have within the project with all the bins as .avb files - which is really cool because you can copy and paste bins between projects if you need some media from one project in a different project etc.  In a shared storage environment, whether it be Avid Unity, Editshare, or whatever, there will usually be an Avid Projects drive which is where you save the project to, and an avid media drive which is dedicated to just media, both of which you mount to your system using the client for whatever shared storage system you're using (we use ISIS). Most likely they will be project specific, as in if your company has 3 different projects going at the same time then there will be 3 different media drives available to mount and you only mount the one relevant to your project. Sometimes though all the projects get kept in the same project drive since there's no benefit to separating them like there is with your media.  Did that make sense? I just woke up and I'm really tired.  tl;dr - you can move project folders around willy-nilly as long as you copy the whole folder and leave it in tact.

So I figured that mystery out.  I am beginning to AE in a couple days on a project for MC. Is there are particular organization system that people use to edit from their desktops then move to Unity/Isis or is it pretty much everyone edits their projects straight to the Unity/Isis? Thanks for your insight!"
editors,366zou,AAARRGHH,5,Sat May 16 22:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Avid projects aren't designed to be opened from the actual file itself. You should always launch avid and then navigate to the folder containing the project, and then select the project from the list.  If it's a shared project, it should live on the Isis and nowhere else. It makes no sense trying to start it locally and then moving it to the isis/trying to integrate it with the existing shared project when it could just be on the isis from the start. More than likely there will already be an isis project set up and you just use that.  As for organisation, there's no universal method. It's always just whatever works best for the company/team. Here's a thread where a few people give their insights: http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/2y1cby/need_help_organizing_projects/  But chances are that whatever team you have will have their own method of organisation. Just roll with it.  Do you know for sure that whatever project you're joining is on a shared storage system with multiple editors?"

If you have a Unity/ISIS (or similar) setup, it's best to consult with your team to learn their preferred workflows. In my office I kind of live within my own folder within the main project, but I've received media from outside firms that indicated AEs worked within their own projects. For the most part, though, if you have a Unity, ISIS, or compatible system, yes, your project belongs there.   I have been practicing on my laptop, but when I move the project folder from one location to another, the project will not open!   What you'll want to do is at the launch screen, where Avid asks you what project to open, hit the radio button for ""External"" and then smack the folder button (it'll look like an open folder) and navigate to wherever you put your project's folder. Hit OK, and it'll show up in the list.   I'm used to dealing with FCP7 where you can move projects willy-nilly.   Well, you're about to be in a world of weird willy-nilly and do-not-touch. Individual bins can freely be moved around, even copied from one project to another. MXF files can be dumped into the Avid MediaFiles/MXF/(number) folder (in collaborative environments, like Unity or ISIS, (number) becomes (workstation.number)) as long as they're MXF Op-Atom files. Those are MXF files generated by ingesting (importing, consolidating, or transcoding) in Avid. Most cameras produce what are called MXF Op1a files, and those must be ingested through an AMA Linking workflow. The specifics of which change slightly depending on the cameras you're working with."

It's just a rebuttal to some of what you've said, and applies to a person who already knows what they're doing with PC building. I'd also like to please request that while this is long, you should read it. Part of it might be an eye opener for you.  You're laying out a false dichotomy. A single user machine absolutely can simultaneously be a work and play machine. Built for both purposes. First you need to consider the fact that for some, such as myself, building and working with computers is not work. I love computers, I play with computers all the time. I follow hardware news like sports fans follow sports statistics. Researching, buying, building and supporting my personal rig at home is not a job. These are not ""on hours"", because they are what I enjoy to do. I do this in lieu of whatever you do for a hobby in your downtime. There is only one time in which working with my computer to fix an issue would be considered ""on hours"", and that's when I have to fix an issue that is holding me back from completing actual editing work. Which so far, has not happened once. Not once.  Also, The longest lasting up time, the most cost efficient, and with the least personal effort can absolutely be a machine you build yourself.  And yes, at many times will building a PC be less effort than buying a Mac. You say this because you assume Macs ""just work"" 100% of the time, but unfortunately sometimes they don't. No computer works 100% of the time, no model is without issue, whether it be an HP, Dell, Apple or a machine you build yourself. The difference is, when you build it yourself and know what you're doing you can get it fixed much faster. When you buy it off the shelf, even from Apple, you suffer days, to weeks of downtime.  Now let me share my personal example of when building a PC was absolutely less effort than buying a Mac. Keep in mind I'm not arguing against the fact that for most people, most of the time, my experience may not and probably will not be the case. I'm arguing against the fact that you said at no time will building a PC be less effort than buying a Mac... my experience is at least one time that you're wrong.  The production company that I currently work for bought a 2013 Mac Pro BTO (6-core, D700, 512GB SSD, 32GB RAM) back in November 2014. We just bought the one, because we wanted to investigate if this hardware was truly right for us before buying more of them. We did all the research in finding what would be the best BTO for us, and I believe we came to the right conclusion. After a few months of testing, and showing it off to the execs upstairs, we got approval to buy four more 2013 Mac Pros of the same BTO. Those four came in early February, and worked just as well as the first one did up until April when it all started to go downhill. We started getting random crashing and lock ups in Adobe Premier Pro, Media Encoder, and After Effects (all CC 2014), as well as Final Cut Pro 7 (which we are still transitioning from to Premier). It happened first on one machine, then another, and another and another. Like clockwork over the course of two weeks all four of the machines purchased in February started to fail on us. All the while the hiccups and lockups turned into crashing, which turned into completely locked up OS X and kernel panics, which turned into the computer completely shutting itself off abruptly. Of course being the knowledgeable person I am, even though I'm an editor I'm the one tasked with figuring out what's going on, so I took a look in the console logs and found some alarming errors popping up on each machine. dumpGPUrestart being the one the one that stood out. If you google this message, most of what you're going to find is forum posts made by people saying that their GPUs in their Macs went bad and they had to have them replaced, sometimes multiple times, before it either worked or Apple gave them a new computer entirely. Uh oh I thought... Naturally I tried all the usual fixes of safe mode, SMC reset, PRAM reset, reinstalling software, etc. etc. there was no fix. This was a hardware issue.  When the first machine started to fail (of course it just had to be mine), I made an Apple Genius appointment as soon as I could, and I wish I could say they fixed our issues ASAP... but here we are, 2/3 of the way through May and we're still down three Mac Pros. Let me delve into our experience getting these machines fixed... Being in Los Angeles we're surrounded by Apple stores, so after the first time I called I was able to make an appointment for the following day, unfortunately not at the closest store. The next day I drove over there with my machine. It would have been nice if someone else could have done it... you know, being that I'm an editor that now being paid to drive across town to the Apple store instead of editing... but no one else could have described to them what was actually happening so we could get a resolution, as I'm the most tech savvy editor we have and I'm also the one who was actually experiencing the issues. A production assistant couldn't explain it, I'd get the Mac back with nothing done to it. So anyways, I'm over at the Century City Apple store coming from the Hancock Park and I spend an hour and a half talking with the Geniuses about the issues I'm having and what I read online. They were skeptical at first, but after I showed them my console logs they agreed to replace both graphics cards. So they authorized the work, but uh oh... they don't keep those parts in stock, as Mac Pros are niche machines. But the Sherman Oaks store had them! So I have to drive all the way up to Sherman Oaks in the valley, drop my machine off for repair and head back to work. Almost an entire day lost to driving and dealing with Apple, but that's OK... I'd get my machine back soon and it'd be good as new, right? Wrong. I got my machine back 5 business days later, so the following week. That was an entire week that I was completely without a new Mac Pro and I was forced to use a 2007 Mac Pro with a shit stock GPU from Apple. But hey it was fixed right? Hahaha... nope. It wasn't. Still experiencing the exact same issues even after they replaced the GPUs, which didn't totally surprise me after reading some of those forum posts from people saying that their machines had the GPUs replaced several times before they worked.  While my machine was getting worked on was when our second machine started failing, our lead editors machine. At this point our CFO called a guy that he knows with Apple's business team and was able to authorize his GPUs to be replaced at our nearest Apple store (The Grove) and was able to get the machine in and fixed in about 36 hours time. So our editor was using his old 2008 Mac Pro for 2 days. His luckily enough hasn't had an issue since then, I wish I could say the same for mine, but it's completely unusable. Since then, the other two of the four have failed completely after multiple abrupt shut downs while editing. It was when these two machines were taken to The Grove Apple store and our CFO called his Apple business team contact there that we were able to get them to agree to advance us 4 brand new Mac Pros of the same build, and we would simply be shipping these defunct four back to them. Granted, that was just yesterday, we don't expect to see the new machines for another 1-2 weeks, and by then we'll have been dealing with these issues for over two months. In the mean time we're renting three base model Mac Pros from Melrose Mac at the cost of $280 a week per machine, and a great deal of our time (because the base model can't push video like our models can).  Apple has great customer service. They've been very understanding and quick as an external company possibly be in working with us. I could never fault them for this. However two months of being without four fully working machines has taken quite a toll on us as a company as I'm sure you can imagine. A lot of this time has been me personally dealing with this. Calling Apple, taking Macs to Apple stores. Dealing with diagnosing the issues, and applying temporary fixes for my coworkers and myself. Installing and reinstalling software on old machines and rental machines. I've probably wasted over two full weeks of editing time dealing with these issues in some way or another. And this is time based on our connections with the Apple store through our CFO, if we were some random joe with one single Mac that he uses at home, Apple would not be so quick to bend over backwards for them. Had one of these faulty machines been my work machine at home, I'd be screwed. My clients would drop me like a hot potato because I wouldn't be able to work for months while my $5K machine was being fixed by Apple, multiple times, before they end up giving me a new one.  Now let's compare this to my current rig at home, a hackintosh. If my GPU fails, I've got a spare in my closet. Pretty soon I'm about to have an even better spare, as I plan to buy the new GTX 980Ti whenever that comes out. But let's say I didn't have a spare... I could go pick one up at Frys in Burbank in about an hour or two and be done with it. Pop it and I'm good to go. Any hardware issue I can solve in a matter of no time. It's my machine, I know whats in it, and I know how to fix it in no time flat. I'll never experience a software issue either, because I can always roll back to one of the many meticulous images I take of my boot partition ever month. Or if its a simpler problem, I've also got time machine running every day on my NAS. There's literally nothing that can stop me with this machine. I can do whatever I want, far faster than I ever could dealing with external company that operates on business hours and has literally millions of customers.  So there... and example of when building a PC absolutely was less effort than buying a Mac."

I'm simply stating a reality of buying a Mac vs building your own. I am a HUGE Mac fan. I'm even tempted to buy their new Macbook that everyone else thinks is a worthless piece of junk, if that's enough evidence for you. Sometimes you can simply do something better yourself.  I'd also like to note again that this is not advice to the OP, and this is not advice to a company. While I would personally advocate hackintoshes to editors who are tech savvy enough, I DO NOT advocate that multi-user businesses delve into them. No one else at the production company would be able to handle a hiccup that a hackintosh might introduce. What would take them a day to Google would take me literally 20 seconds. (with that said, hackintoshes don't really just ""introduce hiccups"", I'm just saying the possibility is there, as it is with any computer).  I'm just refuting your argument. For people who have the know how, building your own rig for editing is absolutely the best way to go. Especially, compared to a Mac that you can't fix with off the shelf parts.  Anyways, sorry to talk your ear off. And I hope you don't take this long winded comment as an attack, that's not my intention."

And in many tasks FCPX can be faster on an iMac than Premiere on a Mac Pro due to GFX optimizations.

editors,3629ah,agent42b,2,Fri May 15 23:46:48 2015 UTC,MCR Operator checking in. Welcome to my world
editors,3629ah,happybarfday,12,Fri May 15 19:44:09 2015 UTC,"Editing a long, long series of ad spots.   We're currently on #9 or so, of 39 planned ads so far.   Until now, producer had been responsible for creative vision, script, etc.  The treatment has been very simple.  I could often cut 3-4 of these spots PER DAY.    Director asks if he can try his hand at a different style.  He shoots it, gives me really awesome, detailed storyboards, etc.  His shots don't really work about 2/3 of the time, so I veer off script/stroyboard but still hold true to the feel he wanted.  Over all, it takes 2-3 days PER AD now... much more involved, tedious, but still better.  I am happy with the result.    Client sees ad #9 (already approved the previous 8).  Loves it so much, wants 1-8 redone in that style.  Pressure builds as we try to explain that we didn't shoot them ""in that way.""  Now I am left holding the ball as I try to re-edit the old spots in the new style, without any of the planning.  Nobody also addresses the fact that it takes 3-4 times long.  Well.. I DO address it, I have just yet to see them do anything about it.  Sometimes, pleasing the client is a double edged sword.  On the bright side, I do look forward to the new material properly shot the way I want it.  This isn't really a WTF moment just yet, but as I've requested extra software/gear to facilitate everything, it may turn into a head butting match as the editorial budget takes a larger chunk than they probably allotted."

editors,35y9fw,kmmk,8,Thu May 14 19:06:12 2015 UTC,"I often try to get as much busywork done as possible sober (organizing, syncing, assemblies/rough cuts, and other things that would kill a buzz), and then smoke some and watch the whole thing from start to finish. Once I'm high, I'm usually WAY more attuned to things that are wrong with my edit - from bad sound design, to transitions, to even major structure and story changes. I usually can't even make it through 30 seconds without finding something glaringly wrong that I have to fix right then before continuing. And these are things that I completely missed while sober.  TL;DR: Weed FTW"

Usually when working out of a private space, far from the deadline day and with the less complex automated things. Everyone is different. I just hate getting caught in those ""ummmm"" moments.   As far as finding creativity. Shiiijt. I find that between the long gigs. Not during. Too many hours in the actual grind. It's hard. You're just focused on last day being as good as first day.   The growth and inspiration comes in between.   Instead I focus on my process and organization during gigs. Repetition breeds mastery. Focus on how you do the basics, and then be extraordinary at the basics.   But also. When you work 50 hrs a week, everyone has a habit. Some it's shopping. Some it's drinking. Some it's whatever. Your job is to know your own, lean on it, but don't lose your health to it.   Get paid. Then get original."

It just becomes a process of elimination with the footage and then knowing how to most efficiently string it together to hit all the project's goals.

That doesn't mean I can't put an artistic touch on it here and there, but there's no point in burning yourself out on projects that the client and audience really don't have much passion for.  Sometimes it is nice to have some busywork I can just do on autopilot during my dayjob and then actually have some creative energy leftover when I get home in the evening. I still like to work on my own personal projects and if I'm tapping out the creative well and exhausting myself on every single job then I'm just going to come home and watch TV instead."

editors,35y9fw,d1squiet,7,Thu May 14 18:53:25 2015 UTC,"I actually also struggle with this quite often. Distractions like reddit don't help at all, either :)  The short answer is that I don't, always. Sometimes the project ends up being a pretty mechanical edit because that's all I got time/motivation for. So it gets done and is more or less acceptable for broadcast (small market public TV has pretty low standards, which doesn't help motivate me either), but it doesn't really have any life, spark, or pizazz. It just sort of...exists.  BUT, what does fuel creativity for me is a project that I can get passionate about. I'm fortunate in that my job tends to throw projects my way that I find fun, interesting, or important. In those cases, the project itself drives me to work hard at it.  In other words, I find creativity and motivation to be an innate thing that more or less just happens. It doesn't really follow a time schedule or a work week very well.  So my answer is don't feel bad if you aren't being ""creative"" every moment of the day or every project. For me at least, I don't think its possible to be going full tilt all the time for a creative job, not without burning out very quickly. Just make sure you get your tasks done when it needs to be. And then, when inspiration does strike, capitalize on it!"

Some jobs are just batshit boring, and there's nothing that you can really do to make them interesting. I just try to get through these jobs with as much professionalism as I can, without wasting mental energy trying to inject creativity where there isn't room for it. Then when an interesting job comes along, I try and flex some creative muscle.  I guess the main thing to do is make sure you have some variety in the types of jobs you take on (if you have any control over this), so you don't end up doing the same stuff all the time.

editors,35wfmn,byahseeker,3,Thu May 14 04:04:27 2015 UTC,"Oh boy...relevant story time.   I've been part of an editorial committee of a book called ""Guide to working in Canadian Factual TV Production,"" which is more or less a fancy way of saying ""reality TV.""  It's, of course, the largest non-union sector of television.    One of the biggest elements we achieved is collecting real world data on salaries, both from some unionized and non-union sources.  All salary figures for virtually every position are disclosed in the book, including editor rates.  You can download a free PDF of the book here: http://www.cmg.ca/en/2015/05/12/cmg-members-produce-guide-to-working-in-factual-tv/    Note: I am not a member of the Canadian Media Guild, but this union is starting to take interest representing reality TV workers and therefore had incentive to fund the project; hence why it's under their banner).   Even in hollywood, wages have largely stayed the same since the late 90s, which means there has been a steady annual decrease of 2-3% when considering inflation.    Combine that with the swath of new low paying jobs, and it certainly brings down the average.  However, keep in mind that the number of well paying positions hasn't actually changed a lot in 10 years; the number of applicants has just dramatically increased.      So how does an editor keep their rate up?  The biggest change in general media creation is that MORE is being done in post.  Editors should start to get involved at the storyboarding stages, taking on somewhat of a post-producer role.  This will usually allow to ask for some extra money as you're seen in the early creative stages of the project and not just at post-production (which is just as creative, but sadly it just isn't seen that way)."

So in some ways editors can charge less as they haven't had to grind really hard to get access to highly expensive edit suites.   That maybe more of a 20 year trend however.   I get more per day as an editor now compared with a few years back (50% more) because I now bring more. Not in terms of editing skills but in terms of understanding my clients. They can give me material SMG very little brief and I will make something useful as I understand their business better.   When they occasionally use someone else they say ""I had to tell them what to cut, almost could have done it myself"" so I think editors being more than just technical skills or story telling skills"
editors,35wfmn,projectorfilms,1 point,Thu May 14 07:00:54 2015 UTC,"We're not being underpaid, but the low-end of the market has hugely expanded in the last 10 years and those attract low-paid applicants.  Basically, colleges over-sold the creative arts as a diploma option for a decade and we now have a glut of graduates on the market and no jobs for them, hence wages are depresses at the low end.  The fashionable diplomas nowadays are coding, mathematics and app development, so our supply of assistant editors and coffee shop barristas is going to diminish somewhat over the next few years.  As an experienced editor, I've seen my rate increase substantially over the last 2 years, but that's mainly due to new clients."

When I lived in west Texas, I was getting paid way less for the same kind of work i've done in north Texas.   At the TV station I worked at, I was a production assistant. When they saw my work, I was asked to help out the main editors while they did their thing. After doing a number of projects, I asked if I could be on salary payroll. They kept telling me 'no' while I was doing big projects, making only $7.45 an hour (yeah, that's some livable wage right there).   I believe it's a matter of who's hiring and who's willing to pay."
editors,35x5pu,drummerboy678,2,Thu May 14 06:38:53 2015 UTC,"In your project, have a sequence called ""highlights"" then place your clips in there as you work. When the project is finished, render this highlight stringout and store. Storing may include entering metadata in CatDV or something similar, obviously some kind of DAM will be needed or a paper reference; whatever floats your boat to allow you to look up what you need at a later date.  To me this solves a lot of issues. First it reduces the numbers of clips you need to track once exported, it doesn't rely on you fishing through bins to find clips with metadata markers, and if you do need to go back to a project to look at highlights (maybe the stringout didn't have enough of a tail for a certain clip) then you know all your selects are in one sequence. It also allows you to use other sequences as the source so you bring in your mixed audio, something you can't really do quickly if you just have a marker on a raw video clip or subclip.  Of course, where larger productions/studios really leverage the ability to search through clips is with transcripts/closed captioning searches. Snapstream comes to mind, but probably not a great fit for your facility and solutions in this area are totally not worth it if you don't already caption your finished materials.  Edit: The footpedal thing for Tricaster is fine in theory, just be aware that ""easy recall"" will include some editorial intervention after the fact. It's really only a cleaner way of making a script note."

Using direct outputs and multichannel outputs; I have to dig up my notes, but it is possible and should get easier in the next version of CC.   Currently, I would like to master to MXF (avoid quicktime, ideally, but not a deal breaker) with a cross-platform codec like Cineform possibly, but Premiere's MXFop1a does not support Cineform.    Well, MXF is limited - you have AVCIntra, XDCam and DNxHD to pick from. DNxHD is the way to go if you want a cross platform codec."

I'm planning to test outputting straight into DNxHD MXF tomorrow and see if we can avoid those glitches.  If you have notes about multichannel outputs I would love to hear about it. Currently, I can output a multichannel master with all of the mixes included, it's just so much setup that it's unrealistic to make a workflow of it for every day use.

editors,35uubv,tipsystatistic,4,Wed May 13 18:26:45 2015 UTC,"Since /u/chainman did a great job on the ELI5 part, I'll do an ELI15.  Ray Tracing is considered the premiere method of producing photo-realistic 3D graphics. How realistic? Well, here's a ray traced image produced with POVRAY. (The Hall of Fame has a lot of really pretty images) The way ray tracing works is that it simulates each and every ""ray"" (in this case a pixel of the image) leaving the camera, back to its light source. After Effects has its own Ray Tracer built in, and lucky enough for you: It's GPU accelerated!  That's great for you, because ray tracing is what's known as an embarrassingly parallel task, since each ray can be simulated separately from each other. In the past (and still today, for larger projects) this would be handled by a render farm, where each computer could take charge of part of the overall task and then send the results back to the mothership. Now it just so happens that GPUs are really good at parallel tasks. After all, that's how they do what they do, and to do it they employ hundreds, even thousands of processing cores to get the job done.  Now here's the bad news: for the kind of work you're doing there isn't enough memory (RAM) on your graphics card to hold all the necessary information to do the work on your GPU. Everything involved in ray tracing needs to be loaded into the graphic's card on-board RAM (AKA: Video RAM, or VRAM; not to be confused with Virtual RAM, also called VRAM). So that's all the textures, the models, any animation involved in the scene, and enough space to store all the data as it's completed until it is complete enough to write to disk. The problem is that the system RAM, which isn't on the graphics card, takes too long to get to the GPU to allow it to do its job efficiently (hence why VRAM is physically mounted right on the graphics card, as physically close to the GPU as is reasonable).  So the end result is that After Effects is giving up on using the GPU for ray tracing and is instead going to rely on the CPU and system RAM to get the job done, which will yield results just as accurate, but will take longer to accomplish. This is why cards like the Titan Z exist, even though the GTX 980 is based on newer technology and can perform faster in gaming: the GTX 980 just doesn't have nearly as much RAM."

Personal stories are an American thing that does not work very well in Europe. We of course also want to hear stories, they just have to be a bit different (meaning: not about Person X from Y who's a guy just like you).  It basically amounts to ""what people are used to"". Politicians and CEOs in the US often craft/adapt a personal story to make a point, which is not a common thing to do in most of Europe. Not that it hasn't been tried.   Here in Germany, Ms. Merkel has tried to use this expository device in a few instances and has been mocked for it (Schwäbische Hausfrau). Every now and then a businessperson also tries it and is ripped to shreds by the audience.  Culturally, it makes a lot of sense that the US audiences like a story about an individual. For Germany, on the other hand, you'd get a point across better if you told the people how your idea makes us collectively better, how it is a reasonable way to progress. Or you could tell a crude car anology. For some odd reason we seem to like those. Then again, in Spain you might be better advised with telling your audience that you are fixing something, righting a wrong, appealing to the audience's sense of injustice.  I couldn't say what other kinds of patterns exist in Europe, but I'm fairly certain that the faultlines lie along some of the European linguistic borders."

That said. This video is the opposite of that. I watched as much as I could  bear.   First, the green screen was obvious. Mainly because the resolution of the photo wasn't very good.   Second, don't talk with your hands when framed in a closeup. It is annoying.   Third,, too much jargon and way too long for something that could have been said much faster. I believe the article points this out. The dry uninspired language combined with what seemed like an unedited script and stream of consciousness lecturing really made the 5 minutes I watched seem like an hour. Get to the point and be engaging.   Last, the fact that it was just a medium shot then a closeup only made the video harder to watch partially because of the lack of enthusiasm from the speaker.

editors,35roh5,le_suck,2,Wed May 13 01:16:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your thorough reply. I have good knowledge of windows systems and RAID arrays, but not specifically of Avid Unity RAID arrays. I figured it was worth to ask to see how complicated this process would be.   We have decided to engage an Avid support group which is conducting data recovery to hopefully get back the required files.   The primary server is a MediaEngine. If we were to get the Mediaarray XT to be the primary server, what would be involved in that? Would the data on the XT be translated via its own metadata set? The XT contains the greater amount of data anyway. It wouldn't be a total loss then.  I discovered the OS was corrupt when I came in early to check everything after a producer/editor team was working on a long night edit and saw a Unity communication error on a machine that had been importing all night. I rebooted, just to see if there was a driver crash or something, and got the same error.   I checked the Unity server and the XT was available for connection (Teamviewer) but the Engine was not. I physically checked the Engine and it was frozen. Would not accept USB mouse input, but was outputting an image on the monitor, with a SMART raid array error popup. Having exhausted all other options I shut down the XT correctly and then performed a hard reboot on the Engine. RAID controller confirmed all avid drives were healthy, ATTO controller was fine, mobo RAID controller gave errors on two 76.5GB system drives. BIOS showed healthy drives. Would not post. Freak out commences.  Again, thank you for your great reply. I will read this meta data backup documentation and implement metadata backup into our operational procedures."
editors,35roh5,le_suck,1 point,Wed May 13 13:05:52 2015 UTC,"If we were to get the Mediaarray XT to be the primary server, what would be involved in that?      There is an unsupported procedure for converting MediaEngine to XT with no hardware changes. You can theoretically change an XT to an ME, but you need licensing for Server2k3, additional RAM, a 2nd boot drive, AND a MediaEngine system image. See below for why this doesn't help.   Would the data on the XT be translated via its own metadata set? The XT contains the greater amount of data anyway. It wouldn't be a total loss then.       In a normal UNITY configuration, each 'engine'(chassis) doesn't form it's own ""Allocation Group"", but instead, is part of a single large ""Allocation Group."" This has the benefit of almost linear throughput scaling when adding multiple chassis to a system.    However, this also means that a single DATA drive failure (non-mirrored configuration) can wipe out your entire unity. Or, in a mirrored configuration, a double DATA drive failure in the event a mirror rebuild did not complete before the 2nd drive died.    I'll back up a little bit and explain some UNITY admin fundamentals:    in UNITY v5.x, the primary server is the MediaEngine. Expansion servers are MediaArray LP or XT. LP technically dates back to UNITY v4.3, and was not a 'desirable' configuration in v5.    there are several abstraction laters before the workspace is presented to the user via fibre manager/client manager application: 1] physical disks 2] Avid IBOD (intelligent bunch of disks) service. the IBOD service reads the firmware information of any attached drives, verifies they are AVID manufactured/signed, and presents them to the media engine as available disks via fibre channel. 3] File Manager Setup Manager. The unity FM is the software that IS the 'unity server'. Setup Manager is the software that allows you to administer physical disks and bind them to a ""data Drive Set'. 4] Data Drive Set is the virtual  abstraction of all physical disks in a single unity system. using Setup Manager, you define what physical disks are active in your data drive set, which are spare, and which are unallocated or RAW. 5] Admin Tool Allocation Group Manager. Once you have setup a DDS, you use the allocation manager to place disks into a group. All disks must be in an allocation group if you want to use them for data storage. 6] Workspaces. Workspaces are the 'virtual disk' that the client ses and writes data to. Once active drives from the DDS are added to an allocation group, their capacity is available for the use of any existing or new workspaces in that AG.     In a mirrored workspace, data is written to the workspace, and in the background, unityFM allocates the blocks of data across the DDS. if you write a single file, each chunk of that file (1024KB in v5) is written 2x. the mirror of the chunk is always written to a different physical drive in the DDS. This is block-level mirroring, not partition or file level mirroring. Thus, it is possible that losing 2 disks causes a large portion of your data to become unusable. Not perfect, but also designed in...1998?      how is this relevant? basically, you NEED ALL the data drives to be present, with a WORKING set of metadata in order for the system to function. The metadata is the map of where unityFM distributes the file chunks. No map=no data.     based on the following:     The XT contains the greater amount of data anyway.     I can assume that the XT was added to the system later, and was done in such a way that the physical disks in the XT were added to their own allocation group, and not to the existing allocation group that contained the ME disks. If this is the case, and you can recover metadata from the ""D:\DATA\AvidOnly"" folder on the ME, you may be able to independently work from the XT only, after recover, but you still need the unityFM software that will only run on the ME.     best bet is to to attempt to revcover the metadata listed in my first post, rebuild the ME OS, and attempt to recover using that.    some additional thoughts: - consider replacing the ME OS disks. keep the existing ones off to the side for safekeeping in the event the rebuild goes poorly. - if the system did not shut down cleanly, your most recent auto-backup metadata may be from hours prior to the failure. There would be total data loss from the time of the most recent metadata save to the time the system went down. I don't remember what the autosave interval is, but I can tell you that of the 3 metadata files, only 1 is the active, the other 2 are backups. - you may need the 'recover disks' file in order to migrate the DDS into the new FM. also why it's a good idea to preserve the existing boot mirrors as-is, in case you miss anything you will need later.    hit me with any questions. I'll see if I have a PDF of the UNITY ACSR book, in which case I'll send you a link via PM.    best of luck."
editors,35roh5,soundman1024,2,Wed May 13 15:18:41 2015 UTC,"You are correct, the XT was added much later to the system and the disks were added to their own allocation group. I see why converting won't be a good idea at this point.   The support group has been directed to replace the ME OS disks, though they did try to simply bring back the ME today because they managed to get it running despite the SMART warnings. It still wouldn't post and I told them half measures were not acceptable.   Thanks for the run down on how UNITY works. If you do come across that UNITY ACSR book I'd love to read it."

If you initially imported the 23.98 footage straight into the 29.97 project, then is a bit more complicated. You won't be able to batch import or relink at a different frame rate if I'm not mistaken.

The great value is that your cursor doesn't have to cross the whole screen to get to its endpoint, you can just kind of ""teleport"" right to it. I recommend setting the programable buttons to application specific tasks too. Also, promise yourself two weeks of not using a mouse and you'll pick it up quickly.

editors,35l2pe,jacon_bacon,2,Mon May 11 17:14:09 2015 UTC,"Nine tenths of organization is habit. If you don't establish a habit then the best organizational plans will go to hell.  Our method of organizing stuff varies slightly between FCP7/PPro and Avid.   Projects Exports For Graphics From Graphics For Audio From Audio Source files Scratch files Documents   Every day we make a duplicate of our sequences. In Premiere we make a duplicate of the project file each day as well, though in Avid we just make new bins. Files and seqences are named thusly:   ProjectName_Part_Date_Time_EditorsInitials_Phase   So project name is self explanitory, and parts only generally show up in the beginning (e.g. Act 1, Act 2) or at the end (e.g. Textless). However if we're delivering multiple versions of a show (e.g. broadcast vs. home video) then that's where the difference would be indicated.  Date and time is pretty helpful when trying to find something from a specific era (e.g. we know we did a couple versions of this show, but we want the one from 2005). It also avoids SNAFUs where someone gets the version number wrong. It's also kind of a reminder to be doing your daily versioning, or otherwise we'd have Chrome-esque numbers, like v45. Time usually only shows up if there are radical changes being made mid-day, or something is being handed off back and forth between multiple people. This helps establish an order of things and make sure you get the right sequence you need.  Phase comes up towards the end when we start moving through onlining, color correction, and mastering, otherwise it's never there and it's assumed to be an offline edit. We also always maintain the last sequence before we bring in mastered audio from Pro Tools.  Editors' initials also are helpful for record keeping, so if you ever need to come back to an old project you'll know who had hands on which things if you need to start asking questions.  Projects are typically organized thusly:   Sequences Old Sequences Footage GFX Music Audio Tech   Sequences should be self-explanitory, and most of the time it has some special characters leading it to make sure it's at the top of an alphabetized project. Old sequences is where we start putting older things when stuff gets too cluttered. A bin for Master Sequences gets created when we reach that point, and it gets elevated right to the top.  Footage is never actually called footage. Each type of footage gets its own bin. So interviews go in the Interview bin, B-Roll in the B-Roll bin, and so on and so forth. These are only the ""final"" versions of footage, which is everything prepped and ready for the editors to use. Synching, transcoding, and everything else takes place in Tech.  GFX and Music are fairly straight forward, and Audio is the final audio we get back from Pro Tools.  Now tech is my own little fiefdom set up for ingesting. In there I'll have separate bins for raw AMA footage, raw ingested footage, raw audio, and so on. As you can imagine this starts to look a little messy after you get a lot of footage, so that's why I keep it all stashed away. It's also where I tend to keep my exports, since I always do a low-res mixdown and kick that out for client review. That gets a bit messy if not contained."

In the absence of the money for a decent 4 drive raid to edit natively, I am going to transcode to 1080p and edit in Premiere Pro CC, and am looking for some reassurance that this is the correct way to go. Here's what I'm thinking.   Transcode to 1080p ProRes with Adobe Media Encoder leaving file names the same. Edit in a 1080p sequence. Create EDL of finished edit. Re-link edl to folder of 4K rushes in a 4K sequence (not sure if I need to copy edit to a 4K sequence before creating EDL.) Output a flattened ProRes444 4K and edl for grade.

editors,35l2pe,tooorangey4crows,1 point,Mon May 11 21:40:12 2015 UTC,"2 is sound. 1, 3 and 4 are a bit misguided as Premiere can do this more easily. Let me elaborate:  Use Redcine-X to transcode. Adobe Media Encoder won't effectively navigate through the RED folder structure and, actually, won't name the file properly; AME keeps the _001 of the first spanned file for each clip and that's junk. Speed difference between the two is negligible, AME only accelerates the scaling and you should make up that time with how easy Redcine-X is to use and navigate.  As far as uprezzing...   Export 1080p h.264 of your timeline. This is your QC file for use and reference later. Duplicate your current project and rename with the suffix _uprez or some such. Open duplicated project and ""make offline"" all your video footage.  Select your sequence, right click and go to sequence settings. Set your edit mode to custom and then resize the sequence size to 4K or whatever your finishing size is. Link Media and that will pop up the link media file browser. Search the folders containing your RED footage. You should deselect file name and file extension and you should re-select media start and tape name. Start the search process through your root 4K footage folder. Place your 1080p file in the timeline, scale to match 4K and set to 40-50% opacity. Render and watch. If you've done any scaling/reframes then you can make sure that adjustment carries over to the uprez. Also, if there were any issues with framerate conversions or an offline clip had incorrect timecode then you can see if any clips are offset or completely wrong, etc.   The advantage to this is that you skip the unneeded process of exporting an EDL only to re-import into Premiere, the same application. It also maintains any audio mixing if you use the audio track mixer on a timeline than the other option of copy/pasting into a larger sequence after relinking your 4K footage.  Oh, as for 4 and 5.... that deliverable is really up to you and whoever is coloring."

When I search based on everything but not File Name or extension it tries to reconnect to the first preview file it finds in there (suffix _F.mov)  Is this expected behaviour (I shouldn't ""relink others automatically"" and just search for and relink each r3D file) or am I just being a monumental dunce?"
editors,35l2pe,tooorangey4crows,1 point,Fri May 15 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"It is expected behavior, albeit an annoying one. Premiere will automatch the first suitable match. The MOV files within the red folder structure are from the RED ONE, they're quicktime proxy files, an old workaround RED used so you could edit the files in Final Cut when the camera first came out.  I would grab a batch file renamer and rename any .MOV to something like .MO_ within the RED folder structure. It'll make Premiere ignore them and it's also super easy to reverse if you need those proxy files for some reason."

So I am an intern and my boss is going to introduce me to an editor who is editing for a sneaker company. He's been working on a project for a while and kind of lost track on what direction to take it so I'm going to see if I can help.   So the videos that were captured are mainly the sneaker on a black BG, smoke around and flashy lights. And deep shadows on peoples faces. The edit is supposed to be more artsy/abstract.   What were going to do is brainstorm ideas on what story to tell but looking at that footage/edit leaves me pretty blank. Not fully sure how to tell a 30 second story with the items provided.

editors,35mxtu,videoworx,3,Mon May 11 22:58:45 2015 UTC,"I'm confused as to why you're resizing it to 1049x576 first. DVD resolution is 720x480 (with a .9 (4x3) or 1.2 (16x9) pixel AR). Trying anything else will force whatever DVD authoring software you are using to recompress the footage. 9Mbit is also pushing it, as most hardware players will barf if you go over that. Back in the day, I encoded most of mine between 4 and 7Mbit, and they look just fine (for SD)."
editors,35lv59,TheViceCampaign,6,Mon May 11 15:57:18 2015 UTC,"Since they stream these clips online, they want to ensure that every network can access this footage without lag throughout the stream; so they've requested that all footage have an absolute bitrate limit of 899kbps while still being as full res as possible (1280x720).   Your client is making a wholly unreasonable request. This is why technologies like HTTP Live Streaming and MPEG-DASH were developed.   These 1-15gb files are then put into MpegStreamclip where we convert them to the client's requested format: Mpeg-4's (H.264, data limited to 800kbps, audio to 96kbps, b-frames, de-interlaced).   Skip that. The Apple H.264 encoder (which is what Streamclip is using) is pretty awful, despite how much Apple loves it. MainConcept and x264 have vastly superior encoders, and at this point I'd recommend grabbing a copy of Handbrake for your H.264 testing going forward, as it utilizes x264 for encoding and offers a lot more little knobs to twiddle in order to optimize encoding, but won't require the kind of investment it would take to get larger, more professional tool. Just watch out: Handbrake has a nasty habit of always adding a second AC3 audio track.   sometimes the quality, despite the clips sometimes surpassing the 899 limit, still have extreme artifacts over the video and look like this.   And that's simply because you're not giving the encoder enough data to adequately describe the video, so it's having to make some hard sacrifices.   Other clips, because of the 1 sec cross dissolve at front and end will artifact until the transition finishes.   That's because of the way H.264 (and most lossy interframe compression formats) work. H.264 uses what are called I-, P-, and B-frames in Groups of Pictures (GOPs) to achieve high compression ratios. The way it works is each frame is sliced up into smaller pieces, called macroblocks. Your I-frame contains a complete and whole image, while P- and B-frames contain motion vectors (that describe the motion of things in the scene) for macroblocks that can be reused from the previous frame (for things that don't change, like say a swinging pendulum or something) while including new macroblocks for things that have changed too much. This allows P- and B-frames to be much smaller than I-frames, and these GOPs typically are anywhere from 12 to 150 frames in length depending on the application. A typical 12-frame GOP would be something like this: IBBPBBPBBPBBI, so for all those B- and P-frames there is, ideally, very little new information that needs to be introduced.  What's happening with your fades though is that because there is so much visual change during the transition the encoder needs to include a whole frame's worth of new macroblocks, and there just isn't enough space in the budget to make it look good. It's running out of data in your 800KbPS cap really quickly.   Other clips, after a pass or two, will essentially cap under 700kbps (anywhere from 450-700) despite the ridiculous data limit that I tell it encode to (e.g 10k or 50k), yet the quality is perfect.   That's because you're getting really lucky with how little visual information there is to encode in those clips. The more visually complex a clip is, and the more motion there is in the clip, the more data it will need in order to accurately render an image.   Anyone run into anything like this and have any tips on encoding incredibly small footage with HD quality video?   Yes. At one point we were trying to develop a project for a client that would have been a specialized content network where some installations could have been running over cellular connections. In the end we decided we needed a minimum of 3-4MbPS for reasonable quality at 720p29.97.   What we're looking for is a program or workflow that has an absolute control over that bitrate range and quality.   Absolute control over bitrate is easy. MainConcept and x264 based encoding solutions will give you that. It's what they're designed to do. Quality, however, will be a function of visual complexity combined with bitrate. There is no magic switch you can flip that will make low bitrate footage look awesome. If there was then Netflix would have everything encoded at super low bitrates and said ""screw you"" when Comcast demanded they start paying for peerage. It's going to be what it's going to be.   We also have to encode all the raw takes to 10mbps too so figuring out a generally more efficient workflow would help out immensely.   I might look at Telestream Episode or Sorenson Squeeze. Both will give you a ton of control over your H.264 stream and both have options for creating presets, batch encoding, and job management. They'll set you back a bit of cash, but it should save you a lot of headaches. If you throw enough cash at it you can even rig up a machine to have watch folders where you'll just dump files meant for one target in one folder and footage for the other in a different one and it'll just run all on its own.   tl;dr: Need HD clips at under 899kbps - how?!   I'd go back and double check that the client really does want this at 720p, because that's kind of on the low end even for SD content. Maybe you could make it happen at 940×540, but we're still pushing it there.  That being said, depending on what your content is you can make things look better, but achieving stellar quality is going to be really freaking hard. This is where we're going to get down and dirty with the bitstream, so things will get a fair amount more nerdinglayvin from here on out.  Depending on how much movement there is on screen at any given time you could try longer GOPs. Looking at that screenshot it seems we're looking at talking heads here, so you could potentially take your GOPs up as high as a full second or two. These are the situations where P- and B-frames really shine. But note this will look like hell with any fancy transitions. It'll work great with simple animations, though, as well as anything with flat colors or gradients.  Check yourself for film noise and simplify your visuals as much as possible. That guy's blue shirt works great because there's a lot of detail in there that the encoder can chuck out without us really noticing it. Same thing for that black background. However if we were talking about someone in a flannel shirt or something it could spell trouble.  Call up one of your client's engineers and talk to them about the H.264 stream. If they allow it try aiming for a High Profile H.264 stream. It'll enable some higher efficiency encoding features to be employed, but at the cost of greater computational complexity (hence why it might not be preferred). Ask about using CABAC while you're at it, as that's a big one that should help you out.  Make sure you're using features like Trellis quantization and weighted prediction, as this will increase the quality of your output but at a cost of longer encoding times. And I think it goes without saying that you should definitely be employing two-pass encoding."

editors,35lv59,Kichigai,2,Mon May 11 18:58:42 2015 UTC,"Depending on what it is you need to get done switching to Handbrake might actually be worth the time and effort. You can quickly slap together a preset and queue up a bunch of stuff for it to handle on the go.  x264 isn't only a better encoder, but it's faster as well. It's based on 64-bit code (which lets it utilize more memory and use the processor more efficiently), it's multi-threaded (which lets it use more than one CPU core), and and it'll obey your average bitrate setting (so you'll only have to transcode once).  Trust me, it'll knock the friggin' socks off the Apple encoder"
editors,35lv59,Kichigai,1 point,Mon May 11 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, you definitely weren't wrong about the quality. First try encoded a 146,409kbps clip to 771 and the quality is perfect.

editors,35lv59,themisfit610,4,Mon May 11 20:17:09 2015 UTC,"Trust me, 2-pass encoding is worth it. You might be able to cheat some time off it by using Turbo First Pass, and if you're working with really clean looking ProRes (that is, it doesn't have a lot of compression artifacts in it) then you can throw the Tune into Film mode and that'll turn off the internal deblocking filter (which you shouldn't need if we're talking about an all ProRes workflow up to this point).

I like having 6+ for 720 and 12+ for 1080, but I also have content that moves a lot.  I think you need to work on managing expectations. Whoever believes that good 720p can be delivered under 3Mbps they should be required to demonstrate it happening.  There are suites that can do a better job at encoding, and you'll get recommendations here soon enough, but managing expectations is going to be a part of this project."

Most of the Premiere metadata is carried in the project. If you open the media in a different project...it's not there.  Software that does it isn't cheap - and none of it is really prosumer-ish.

If you want to go absolutely bonkers and top of the line you could get an Nvidia GTX 980, which is their current top-of-the-line card for about $500. However if you're a little more patient the 980 Ti is due out soon, and that sucker will have more RAM.  The computational performance on the GTX 970 and 980 alone are better than the numbers being crunched on the absurdly expensive Titan cards, which really only have the benefit of loads more RAM (up to 12GB on the Titan Z) to edge out the cheaper cards.  This will, hands down, be a night-and-day difference for you, assuming that you aren't experiencing bottlenecking at the HDD or RAM levels.

For example, I'm on a production shooting 2K DPX files on the Canon C500 using the Odyssey 7Q+. We're also creating HD MXF proxies simultaneously. The HD files are easier to cut since they're much less taxing on your editing system than the DPX files especially if it isn't beefed up as far as specs. These are your ""offline"" files.  Once we have a locked cut, I'll reconnect the media to the hi res 2K footage making them ""Online"". Then the cut goes to the colorist, sound designer, etc.   That's the gist of it, mostly.

editors,35ioul,CoolDudesJunk,4,Sun May 10 21:58:14 2015 UTC,"Also fun to see where it came from, to boil it down:  Film was brought into an offline editing suite. Here, the tools would be basic and the editor wouldn't be amazing at anything other than cutting. Once you have a 'picture lock' then you could move into the far more expensive studio with all of your film. That way you're only using the expensive suite (more tools, better editors) for a day or two, and you can experiment with the story and feel in the cheap offline suite."
editors,35ioul,Ghost_Road,10,Sun May 10 23:29:00 2015 UTC,"As well as the cost factor, another reason for offline/online editing was that linear editing is a physical process. Rather than moving proxies on a screen, we were physically recording to tape each edit. If the director decided to change an edit two minutes previous to where you were now, you had to physically re-record and ripple all the edits between that point and the new. Do that a few times, and you'd start getting worried about dropouts on the tape.   Where I was working back in the 90's, we would make a copy of the source tapes, including copying timecode as we went, and then would leave the original wilds until the online. That way we were preserving the quality of the original wilds, and making sure they were passing across the heads as little as possible. It meant that in the online session, the tapes we were recording from, and the tape we were recording to, had as little wear as we could manage to prevent any tape based errors.  My offline suite had a BVE 910 and a disk unit to save the EDL on a floppy disk, with a backup printer that printed a paper copy of the EDL.  Ahh, linear editing. Fun times!!!"

editors,35ioul,Russell_Arch,5,Mon May 11 11:43:00 2015 UTC,"When raw footage is shot at full resolution, the file sizes are large and can often be too cumbersome to store all of this media for editing purposes. In this case, footage is often ingested at a lower resolution for ""offline editing"". This is especially true for multicam projects or large documentary films.  Raw footage would be considered ""1 to 1"" or 100% pristine. Often times this raw footage is transcoded and reduced to 4 to 1, or even 10 to 1 in order to store all the media for a project. This reduced quality media is now ready for an offline edit. This way, editors can cut with the offline footage again and again, until the project is edited to everyone's satisfaction.  At this point, the offline sequence is re-linked to the raw footage and the finished cut is then ""uprezzed"" with the pristine media for the online process. Here, the  online footage is color-corrected while the audio is cleaned up and perfected.

editors,35ioul,stpetestudent,4,Sun May 10 21:51:14 2015 UTC,"This is a very very basic explanation, but I think it should cover what you're looking for:  When shooting on modern cameras in RAW formats, the files for each of the clips are too large and unwieldily to use in most NLE's (the computer would just die). In order to work around that, the RAW footage is transcoded into a lower resolution version of the file that the NLE can easily and quickly access. This low resolution version of the master file is called the offline and most project workflows use this offline version to cut the show/feature/commercial, etc.   Then, once the show is locked and no more cuts are going to be made, the online begins. This is basically using an EDL (a list of source timecodes used in the sequence), to match everything back to the original RAW camera files. Then the colorist can start their color correction pass with the RAW files before shipping out for distribution.  Hope that helps!"

Online editing is where you relink your timeline from the offline to the online (full quality) footage. This is where color correction happens (and effects). We try not to have further changes at this point.  Conforming is the actual process of switching, especially between two different tools.  All of this could be done in the editor, or in different tools.  Ex: I did the offline edit in Avid Media Composer. I then conformed my final timeline to the online footage in DaVinci Resolve so I could color grade and finish.  The audio went to ProTools."

In simplest terms, offline editing is the stage of post where you assemble and craft your story. Once everything is in place, online editing is the phase where you do finishing work, especially color correction, to conform the material for broadcast. By necessity, Offline is in a lower resolution because you are managing storage space for all of the material you shot/acquired, which can be hundreds of hours of footage. Online material is limited to the length of the show (roughly) and is footage is brought in at your finishing resolution."

If it's strictly editing, keep it at that. Make sure to point out what you did for the project in the video description.

If the Director/Editor wants a different LUT applied (usually a 709 is fine for offline), you will have to Transcode and add the custom LUT using the RAW/4444 files in Resolve. OR you can import the flat RAW files into Avid and apply the LUT in the Avid.  Install LUT is under the color management settings.  Having 2 sets of files is normal for an offline workflow. You just supply an EDL to the finishing house and they pull from the RAW/4444 files.  A couple IMPORTANT notes:   File names and timecodes must match EXACTLY between the two files. Won't be a problem if the camera is generating both. Most editors will have you rename the Clip Names.

Also, how do I import the 709 LUT into Avid?   It's under Source Settings when you right click on them. One of them should be color controls. In that display you can import a new LUT into the project.   Do I bring in the ProRes Proxies first and then import the 709 LUT separately and apply it to all clips or import everything together?

The 709 LUT on the proxies will be baked in, so you'll have to go to the RAW if you want to apply a different LUT.  If they will be creating a custom LUT, the DUT/Loader should be able give it to you on the Proxies.  Or you may want the proxies to be Log C so you can just apply it in the Avid.  If you're figuring out a workflow for a new show, this should be a discussion/decision between everyone involved. Getting it right will make it easier for you on the months to come."

From there you have several options.  The most logical would be to transcode that final sequence into DNxHR at full resolution, export an AAF to resolve (which can link to this avid media directly).    4) Do your grade in resolve.

editors,35ekh8,Nickyjtjr,11,Sat May 9 16:10:56 2015 UTC,"I want to make an investment into a nice big RAID drive   RAID is just a way of describing how you're combining a bunch of drives into a storage pool, so as a result there are a multitude of different kinds out there and to figure out which one you need you need to answer a few questions.  First: why are you looking at a RAID array? Is it for speed? Redundancy? Expanded capacity? If it's a combination of those, what's the order of priority?  Second: Are you looking for a DAS (Direct Attached Storage, a dedicated array for just one computer), or a NAS (Network Attached Storage, accessible to any computer on your network)? If you're looking at a DAS do you want it to be an external device or would you like it to exist within your computer case?  Third: What do you plan on using this RAID array for? Do you plan to work directly off of it? Is it going to be just for storage? Is it for backup? Is it just temporary fast storage?  Fourth: How much money are you willing to throw at this?   What are the features? Benefits?   There are multiple RAID levels that an array can take advantage of, and each one offers different features.  RAID0 (minimum of two disks)  Offers the highest possible speed of any level, but offers no redundancy, so losing one disk can cause catastrophic data loss. RAID0 also allows you to utilize all available storage. This is sometimes called a Striped Disk set, or a ""scary RAID.""  RAID1 (minimum of two disks)  Offers full redundancy and improved reading speed over a single disk, but it only allows you to utilize 50% of the disks' capacity as one disk is a copy of the other. This is often called a Mirrored Disk Set.  RAID5 (minimum of three disks)  Allows you to utilize about 75% of available disk capacity, and better write speeds than RAID1 (but not as fast as RAID0). It can tolerate the loss of one disk from the array without any data loss by using parity calculations to rebuild data. However RAID5 can suffer data loss if it loses power while writing to the disks. This phenomenon is known as the Write Hole and can be avoided by putting your array on a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Source, AKA: battery backup).  Because parity calculations have to be performed for redundancy the hardware used for managing the array (called a RAID Controller) has a big impact on array performance and recovery times.  RAID6 (minimum of four disks)  Very similar to RAID5, except it provides two parity calculations, which provides greater resistance to the write hole (but doesn't eliminate it) and allows you to lose a maximum of two disks. The down side to this is that you only can use 50% of your disk capacity, but the main advantage is that it can tolerate the loss of two disks at once without losing data.  This is important because when an array is recovering from a drive failure it is reading data from the entire array in order to rebuild the lost drive, and this is incredibly stressful on the hardware and dramatically increases the likeliness of another drive failing. Also if a disk has failed due to age (as opposed to a defect) then generally all the other disks in the array are around the same age and are also more likely to fail.  So by tolerating the loss of two disks RAID6 is kind of like an insurance policy.  RAID10/50/60  Also known as Nested RAID. These configurations provide for the least amount of available capacity, but provides the most redundancy, and is often employed on larger disk arrays (such as twelve or more disks).  RAID10  This is the most common configuration. All the disks are set up as RAID1 pairs and then a RAID0 array is made on top of those RAID1 pairs. This configuration offers about the same performance as RAID1, but can tolerate the loss of up to half of its disks. Rebuilds are less stressful on the entire array, and it's simple structure allows it to be very cheap to implement. This requires a minimum of four disks to implement, and is feasible to operate entirely without dedicated hardware.  RAID01  Less common where RAID0 sets are estabished as the base and RAID1 is set up on top. This generally provides greater speed than RAID10, but can only tolerate the loss of one disk. It's generally only used in situations where RAID5 isn't feasible.  RAID50/60 and RAID05/06  Basically the same as RAID10 and RAID01, except change out RAID1 for RAID5 or RAID6. These are typically used when more capacity is needed than RAID10 can provide, but a very large disk array is still desired.  Non-standard RAID  Non-standard RAID arrays are typically the kinds you find on some motherboards, or in specialty applications, like Drobo's BeyondRAID.  ZFS  ZFS is a software RAID implementation that is very resource intensive, requiring a relatively decent CPU with a lot of RAM, but is used in situations where the greatest protection against data loss is desired (as ZFS provides a lot of safeguards against data corruption). It is generally not suitable for editing directly from, though it does function well as a backup or storage target.   Any good tutorials on setting it up and using?   The guides will vary depending on the system you wish to implement. Some systems are simpler to set up than others, with several turn-key solutions on the market.  Just remember: RAID is not a backup. It's intended merely to be a way of either creating a large storage pool or providing fault tolerance. Even with a RAID array you should still have a proper backup solution in place."
editors,35ekh8,Kichigai,1 point,Sat May 9 17:29:28 2015 UTC,"This is a great and well-explained post and I definitely learned things from it. I was just wondering though, what exactly is the difference between RAID 10 and 01? In my head they should both be able to lose two drives, but you mentioned that 01 can only lose 1 drive. Why is that?"
editors,35ekh8,AAARRGHH,2,Sun May 10 07:11:21 2015 UTC,"A RAID-10 and a RAID-01 is just semantics for which stripe is on the bottom and which is on the top. Both can lose two drives, but in both instances once one drive is lost there's a 67% chance the next drive lost is a loss of the volume.  If you have RAID-0 on the bottom you have two A drives and two B drives with the RAID-0 being a stripe of A and B. In this instance you can lose and A and lose a B and because of the RAID-1 above you're okay. If you lose an A you still have two B type drives, but you only have one A. If you lose the remaining A then you only have half of a RAID-0 stripe and you've lost the volume.  With a RAID-1 on bottom it's the same. You again have an A set and a B set. The two As are mirrors and the Bs are mirrors. If you lose an A you can't lose the remaining A.    I prefer to avoid RAID-10/RAID-01. Plenty of people say the same about RAID-5, but it's my preference. Neither is a backup solution, so let's throw the two drive failure argument out. If you had two drives fail and your RAID-10 is in tact you defied the odds. Pros of each: RAID-10 has less latency, faster writes, and tolerates 2 drive failures if your'e lucky. RAID-5 has faster reads and 25% more capacity. As a video editor what do you prioritize? Capacity and read throughput. Writes are ingest and rendering, things we always wait on. Reads mean more layers of video are possible and capacity will get used sooner or later.  There are different tools out there to fit different needs. I believe RAID-5 checks the right boxes for video, but plenty on this forum will disagree. How you manage your storage is your deal. So long as your clients get their videos on time you were successful."

I get 1GB/sec read/write: 1 gigabyte per second.   This is principally my file-based store: dpx, exr, tiff, JPEG2000 sequences.   Benefits is the read/write speed of media, the idea that I can have one drive fail and for there to be enough parity data on the remaining 5 drives to recover, and large functional space. It also plays nicely with my filesystem. Try opening a folder with 179,000 files in it when authoring a DCP on a NAS / shared volume... Lots of spinning wheels.   Backup is limited to media I can't regenerate.  So camera originals are backed up to tape, anything else that is transcoded or rendered is simply left to RAID protection. Project files are saved to another server that has nightly tape backups and weekly off-site rotation.  I've never lost anything; and the most I'd lose would time to re-render or either one day or 5 days of project files. A disaster but not the end of my business.    Near line storage is an EON NAS - 24TB over 1 gigabit ethernet. Mostly camera rushes ready for transcoding or backups. The shared edit storage with the other five edit stations are off an 18TB SmallTree titanium Z.  It can do smb for windows, afp for Mac, iSCSI for Avid volumes, nfs for apple FCP X shared storage etc. connected over 10Gb Ethernet - large files are copying at 900MB/sec.  Terrible at large image sequences.  I'd suggest an offline workflow for anything 4k.  Transcode to DNxHD 36 or apple ProRes LT for cutting, then conform to 4K for your grade and final delivery."

If you go with RAID 1 or 5 consider buying a spare drive for it before you need it. When I had a pile of G-Speeds at a facility I worked at (about 10 of them for local scratch) I liked having a spare on the shelf do I could rebuild the array while the bad drive went back to support for replacement. It's important to match not just the size of the drive but the model of the drive inside the enclosure.  Remember that RAID 1 and RAID 5 are NOT substitutes for backups. They offer no protection against deletion, corrupted files, power anomalies, natural disasters, and most significant on Mac, corrupt file systems. Apple's HSF+ file system's problems are well documented. Volumes can suddenly vanish.  Drobo BeyondRAID sounds great, and it is for some, but there are a few caveats. If you want the pros go to their website. Here are the cons: it's expensive, performance degrades as the drives get full, and data recovery is hella expensive of it's possible. Recovery for a standard RAID is far more feasible. It may or may not make sense for you, but it's worth adding to the conversation. I've never used one."
editors,35ekh8,soundman1024,1 point,Sat May 9 23:36:42 2015 UTC,It's an iMac. Here's a question. Can you configure RAID JBOD to function as raid 10? Are there any tutorials on how to set up your RAID system.  This thread was intended to be less about gear and more about how to use since I've never used a raid system before and am coming in as a noob.
editors,35ekh8,soundman1024,2,Sun May 10 16:05:16 2015 UTC,"The how isn't a big question typically. When you buy a box it usually comes preconfigured as a RAID-0. (Capacity sells.) Once you look at the manual and reconfigure it as a RAID-10 you don't think about the how again. The how changes from manufacturer to manufacturer, which is why you don't see a lot of discussion about it.  With a JBOD you'll be dependent on a software RAID. Mac OS can do this for you, but using it in Windows will be limited to a VM, the volume won't be readable with BootCamp. There is some CPU overhead associated with using a software RAID, but I wouldn't worry about it too much. The main thing is to make sure you have a fast link between the drives and the system. Thunderbolt in your case.  Here's a solid walkthrough on setting up a RAID-10 using Disk Utility. It's pretty easy.  As I said above, remember that RAID-1 (and by extension 10) isn't a substitute for a good backup. Redundancy protects against hardware failure, but not software failure. Bit rot (a documented problem for Apple's HFS+) can lead to files and folders vanishing unexplainably. This isn't a software RAID problem, but a software RAID is stacking stripes on stripes which can compound the problem. Make sure you aren't relying entirely on RAID-10 as your backup solution."
editors,35ekh8,soundman1024,1 point,Sun May 10 16:30:25 2015 UTC,"Very helpful. So last question, if I see a system on BH advertised as RAID 0, does that mean I can go into disc utility and reconfigure it as RAID 10? Also (slightly unrelated) I've been working with 4k footage from a USB 2 drive, and had stutter issues.  With a RAID 10 thunderbolt system so you think those issues would be resolved?"
editors,35ekh8,branawesome,1 point,Sun May 10 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"If you're looking at something like a G-RAID you probably can't reconfigure them. This is a hardware RAID-0. It knows how to do a RAID-0, but it can't be taught to do a RAID-1.  The good news is you can buy two of them and make a RAID-01 in Disk Utility. When you connect them they'll show up as a single volume. The RAID-0 controller sits between the drives and the system and it presents one 8TB volume to Disk Utility. Disk Utility can't see the drives, just the volume. You can, quite easily, create a software RAID-1 out of the two enclosures. As far as Disk Utility is concerned this is a RAID-1.  Because of the way it's architected one enclosure can fail and your data is safe. Send that one off for repair ASAP. When it comes back you need your backup to rebuild. Apple's software RAIDs do not allow you to add a volume to the RAID-1 set after the fact and rebuild the degraded array. Attempting to recreate the software RAID-1 will involve wiping your RAID-0 drives clean before you're able to build a new RAID-1. Then you restore from your backup.  If you plan on rebuilding a RAID-1 remember that at one point you're down a copy, so if your backup (now primary) is your only copy.    As for editing 4k, that's a different discussion. What kind of footage? RED? F55? GH4? Some flavor of ProRes?"

editors,35ekh8,dejavont,1 point,Sun May 10 17:19:46 2015 UTC,"You should be good to go for ProRes. Apple's ProRes White Paper tells us ProRes 422 at 4k/30p is about 630Mbps. 24p and 25p are less.  A G-RAID gives about 325MBps, which is about 2600Mbps. (1MBps = 8Mbps)  With two G-RAIDs in a software RAID-1 you should be able to safely play 3 streams (layers) of 4k 30p, and you might be able to get 4 streams of 4k 24p. This is a storage I/O analysis, not a processing power analysis.  As for RAW, I would suggest a new thread. Tell the kind of RAW, the NLE, and your system specs. Chances are you'll need ProRes or an offline/online workflow to use RAW with an iMac."

editors,35cgkl,k2737,18,Fri May 8 23:49:50 2015 UTC,"The storage world doesn't change very quickly. What was true 9 months ago is probably still true today.  The big four questions:   What's the total throughput you need to support all of your clients? If you need 3 streams of 1080/24 DNxHD available at 8 seats you can easily calculate how much I/O you need to be able to deliver off of the drives to the core and from the core to each client. How much space do you need online? Tens of terabytes? Hundreds? Petabytes? If you need a lot of I/O but not a lot of space you might be setup differently than if you need a lot of space but not a lot of I/O. What operating systems do you need to be able to support? Some solutions are happy cross-platform and some like to be more specific. With more and more users going away from Apple a cross-platform solution isn't a bad idea. Is the storage a part of a larger conversation? Does your shop have a MAM — media asset manager? Do you have need for a MAM? Avid has solutions, but if you aren't using Avid CatDV is the most popular option. Grass Valley will sell you a turn-key solution with K2 storage, Stratus media management, and the Edius NLE. (That's an example, chances are you don't want Edius.)   I've worked at shops with Isilon and Terrablock. They were both fine. Both shops were using Atto fiber cards. One shop planned ahead with more storage than they needed and has been happy. One didn't have the budget to get what they needed and could have saved a lot of time if they had more online. As always plan for where things might be at the end of this storage system's lifespan and for backups. If you only need HD today but plan on being UHD within the lifespan you should make sure your I/O and capacity will be able to support the extra load. Plan for two or three extra seats as well. Even if the company doesn't grow you might need freelance help finishing a project or have a dedicated ingest station or something like that. If you don't have room to grow out of the gate your'e in a bad spot.  Video storage is different than IT storage. We hit the servers for streams of data rather than quick updates to small files. If you're new to video an integrator would be a great approach. They know how to build something for video. Small Tree, Diversified, and Cutting Edge all come to mind off the top of my head.  There's a storage area on the Creative Cow forums. That would be a great place to go poke around if you want to learn more about storage for video."

Go with thunderbolt if you are editing off of it, preferably one that plugs into wall. (More reliable). There is one thing that I regret: make sure you get one that has two thunderbolt ports so you can daisy chain other drives or monitors and still be able to use the drive. Mine only has one port and I regret that now.   For just backup stuff that you'll rarely use, go for bulk. For example.

This gives us the whole history of the project and we can go back to it if we need anything (like some form of a sequence that we excised). Each sequence is duped on a day-to-day basis. And if we have a diverging approach to something, then that gets duped out before moving on. And each stage of work gets duped too, so when we move on from a locked cut to color correction that's in a copy of the sequence.

editors,35amnz,videouser,4,Fri May 8 14:41:49 2015 UTC,"This week my boss came to me with a ""research project."" Find a way for the producers to collaboratively share notes with a Wiki-like system that features a WYSIWYG editor (so they don't have to learn markup or markdown), allows them to embed images and video, and we can lock down (because the final version needs to be accessible from homes).  I'm not sure where in my job description it said ""MySQL admin,"" but now I am one because my boss told me this whole thing had to be implemented without requiring intervention from our part-time IT guy (who charges us every time we have to call him).  For whatever reason Google Docs was ruled out as an option (even though our Enterprise account has it enabled) so my first inclination was to set up a MediaWiki, which despite its name isn't the most multi-media friendly thing out of the box. Nonetheless I spun up a CentOS virtual machine (to match our VPS, which this thing could eventually be living) and set it up. It wasn't too hard to do, especially since I had set one up before in college, trying to build a Wiki for note taking in classes (it didn't work out).  In my research of WYSIWYG extensions (since the default MW editor exposes markdown and has only a few shortcuts, which would flummox at least one of our producers who is very easily intimidated by technology) I came upon Twiki, which seemed be exactly fit the bill for what I was looking for. So I spun up a new VM (fortunately I had made a snapshot of my VM post-OS install, pre-Wiki install) and set to work putting Twiki together. Oh lordyloo it is the most contrived thing I've ever had the misfortune of trying to set up. I'd get permissions errors, problems with CGI, Apache refusing to respond, Perl scripts being exposed rather than executed, it was a mess.  Eventually I gave up and refocused my efforts on the MediaWiki, which my boss seemed to be OK with, even though I hadn't nailed down embedding images, and hadn't even started on embedding videos (which looks to be almost impossible, unless it's hosted on YouTube or something). This morning I discovered that the WYSIWYG editor I installed breaks a lot of default Wiki markdown, which irks me to no end, so I'll be looking into replacing it. Currently the whole thing is still in a virtual machine for testing, and the only two people who have access to it are me and my boss, so I still have the opportunity to change things up.  Today's research project: find a way to design and distribute HTML emails. Like with tables and layouts and embedded images and everything. Oh boy.    Side WTF: this past winter we had air conditioners installed in our machine room, since the building manager shut down the AC units and even when they were configured to run they wouldn't start back up properly if they had shut themselves off at any point. You might think, ""gee, winter in Minnesota, that ought to keep that room cool anyway,"" especially since the ceiling of the room is the corrugated steel roof. Well, you'd be wrong since we had a warmer than usual winter (temps around 50ºF), and our machines do a decent job of generating a lot of heat, so the room would get in the 70ºF+ range.  Part of the installation included piping and hosing to deal with the condensation these units would produce, along with a pump to push the water up to the roof so we wouldn't have to deal with emptying out things. Well, just looking at the installation it was a bit of a mess. The piping was routed well enough, but the hose going out to the roof was tied down with zip ties so tightly that it created obvious pinch points. But since the units produced no condensation it wasn't an issue.  Flash forward to yesterday: building maintenance gets a call about a dripping coming from the ceiling on the floor below us. So maintenance comes in and starts pulling up panels from our false floor, and they figure out where the dripping is coming from: our AC units. They never connected the damn pump to a power source so water just collected in the pipes and then overflowed onto the floor of our equipment room! (Yes, that is rust)  As if that's not WTF enough once they plugged in the pump then they discovered the pump was inadequate for pumping water up to the roof (about six to ten feet up). Dee-freakin'-lightful."

Does the problem persist? In what format? Are the individual clips with visual glitches traced back to your network server original footage? Do you see this glitch if all original footage is local? If the answer is yes to the former then you might want to do some network tests with transferring and checksumming large files to see if information is being corrupted during transfer. This is usually caused by a faulty ethernet cable or by cable/network noise like ethernet running in the walls next to mains power, etc. As far as Premiere lag, I would bet it's an unrelated issue.

I don't really know the balance between older models with low clock speed/more cores or a recent model with less cores/higher clock speed and better hardware such as ram.   Generally newer is better, as the individual cores may have been faster, even if the clock speed was slower. Don't get too hung up on RAM, though. You can always add more yourself very easily, though since it's all ECC server-grade RAM it can be a little pricey.  Since you're in the Adobe world you may want to consider swapping the GPU while you're at it. A lot of those suckers came with ancient Nvidia GPUs on the low end (like the 200 series) or now-depreciated ATI GPUs on the high end (like the 5770). Those older cards don't support CUDA, and their OpenCL performance (if it'll even work) is downright abysmal. You can easily swap out the GPUs for something like an NVidia 750Ti for around $150 or so, and you'll notice a big jump in performance (though you'll lose your boot screen, which includes Single User Mode and any other pre-OS X screens, which can be pretty spooky)."

You want bang for buck out of it as you want money going towards the next box, not hitting this box with the paddles and keeping it alive.  /u/kichigal is completely on point. A new video board will make a huuuuge difference if you're using Premiere on a MP tower. The GPUs were underpowered when the towers launched and they haven't aged gracefully. Adobe have architected Premiere, SpeedGrade, Media Encoder, and soon (CC15) After Effects to GPU as processing unit. It's great to have the GPU working, but the decreased duties for the CPU are the real win here. If you have to make a budget decision look for 12+ GB of RAM, 8+ cores, and enough leftover for a 750Ti. Next is RAM to 16GB, then 12 cores, then more RAM.  When looking at a GPU a gaming board like the 750Ti is going to give you a lot more power for a lot less money. It won't have the precision features or stability a workstation board with Quadro drivers, but given that you can double the performance for 33% of the money I think the 750 is the clear option.  I won't go with a 3,1 tower at this point. If I remember correctly the PCI architecture changes a lot when the 4,1 comes on the scene. You want 4,1 or 5,1."

I edit in Premiere mostly. Got the computer used on Craig's List for $1500 and then upgraded GPU. If I were doing it again I'd get the same model and do a GTX Titan X.   I'm also looking into upgrading the CPUs. I purchased some used six core 3.06 CPUs on eBay and I've been reading up on the process, seems doable, just need to get the 12 core memory."

If you're doing straight editing (not compositing/motion graphics) I doubt there is anything hardware wise you can't do even with a 5+ year old Power Mac. There are some types of footage (4k/redcode/raw) that might require you to still do an offline workflow but you can still absolutely get the job done.  Chances are if you 2 core can't handle a specific codec in realtime the 8 core won't either and you'll still need to do an offline workflow.

Without an appropriate LUT, you're not going to get anything worthwhile from creating proxies in Resolve without some work. The idea is that you would use Resolve to create a rough grade for proxies to edit with. as it lacks a proper Magic Lantern RAW to Rec709 profile or LUT, you are likely to continue to get poor results from simply slapping on mismatching options for the footage and exporting without any tweaks."

Did you get the rights to the song in the card (can't remember exactly what it was)?  The rights only matter if you are planning on showing it at festivals or making any money off of the short.

It was definitely a passion project that spanned over many years, software and computer updates, and jobs.  I know it's a long film to ask a stranger to watch, so thank you all!  The plan was always to do heavy score and VO.  There weren't too many editing ""decisions"" that needed to be made, because each shot lined up with a specific line of dialogue.  Timing was probably the biggest challenge.  No rights for Arnold or Sly, everything else was made custom.  The entire film was scored by a very talented musician in Chicago, which really helps the pacing.    Not making money off of it - it's played at a couple festivals and just got accepted to 3 more over the next month, which we're very excited about.  A couple tech notes if you're interested.  Shot on RED at 4k, original line edit was done in Premiere, then we were having too many crashes and bugs using dynamic link for the FX shots from After Effects, so we did an XML to FCP7, where we online with our FX shots (done in AE) and our graded files from DaVinci.

Resolve will detect D700s as Radeon HD 7900s which have a higher clock speed and 1/2 the GDDR5 memory.  That means the Resolve application will drive your D700s as though they are HD 7900s, only utilizing 1/2 the potential memory and overclocking the GPUs substantially.  This has led to overheating & under performance.  Has to do with unexpected behavior between Apple's modified OpenCL implementation and Resolve's HW Identification method (specifically, Apple's OpenCL implementation doesn't expose specific HW data that Resolve would need to accurately identify the available GPU) BlackMagic could invest dev resources to alter their HW ID method, but it's unclear when Apple will release their OpenCL 2.0 implementation on OSX (or what specific quirks will come along with it) so it's unlikely that the Resolve product team could justify the cycles to fix the problem themselves.  http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/12/30/apples-latest-mac-pro-continues-to-cause-problems-for-professional-users  Possible crumby solution:  Run Windows on your Mac and Resolve will run fine.

editors,3530iy,Fluxwise,3,Wed May 6 18:00:42 2015 UTC,"This isn't tough at all. I'm working on a project that has many sequences like this. Don't be overwhelmed.   1) find a few themes. Ask for as much info from them on what they want in terms of mood, pace, etc. For instance, in my project, there's a short (40 seconds) bit that focuses on virility or machismo in cinema, going from Westerns to contemp action &c. Since this was my main theme, I scrubbed through about ... ~50 movies (googled for lists like ""manliest movies of all time"" , so you could google similar things and cross ref with your list) just looking for clips that related to that theme.   2) find a structure. My structure was this: first half (1) westerns: 1a) heroic closeups of cowboys &c. 1b) escalating violence 1c) more heroic shots, some sarcastic, but moving into contemp cinema (2) contemporary cinema so 2a) heroic shots of misc heroes 2b) violence 2c) outro, lots of sarcasm and irony here.  Each section had its own structure too. So for both sections on violence, it moved from physical violence (fist fights) to more extreme forms (pistols to machine guns to explosives to whatever).  There were other short sub sections I included, like guys with face paint, guys who physically assault women, guys attempting suicide, as brief transitions between the larger sections.  Once you figure out a basic structure, import as many movies into your NLE as it can handle and start scrubbing, cutting and pasting clips that may work for a section either into a separate sequence/timeline for that section or into one big timeline. While you're scrubbing you'll likely find other clips that may work for your theme (I didn't anticipate so much physical violence toward women by ""heroes"" in cinema but started pasting all that footage together). There will also definitely be lots of compiled clips you'll need to totally cut out (I had tons of clips of guys taking off their jackets or shirts in virile poses, from Butch Cassidy to Wall Street to Batman &c, but I had to cut that bit out because of time constraints).  Also, find the highest quality footage available (perhaps torrent?) This allows you to scale footage and manipulate it in other ways during post. Almost every clip I used is sped up by ~250%.  Finally, once you find all the clips, export them. Don't try to edit in the same file that houses that multitude of movies. I tried to import those movies into the scene I was working on (which already had like 17 hours of high res footage) and the work process was impossible. Render the clips out losslessly and then edit them together. In my case, my computer could handle a separate file just for this short sequence even with all the movies imported.

But I am still looking because I know what that person can do for my professional development."
editors,352a4w,merchantfilm,2,Wed May 6 14:45:08 2015 UTC,I've never been asked to show my degree to any client. Sure it was on my resume but I've only submitted a resume to maybe 1 out of 10 clients and they were much more concerned with my reel and previous work. Generally employers and clients in this industry don't care much about whether or not you went to college. I get most of my work through word-of-mouth and clients are more interested in you based on a good recommendation than some piece of paper. At least half the people I work with in film never went to college or dropped out.

editors,352ps4,Kichigai,1 point,Thu May 7 21:32:19 2015 UTC,"U-matic:       U-matic is an analog recording videocassette format first shown by Sony in prototype in October 1969, and introduced to the market in September 1971. It was among the first video formats to contain the videotape inside a cassette, as opposed to the various reel-to-reel or open-reel formats of the time. Unlike most other cassette-based tape formats, the supply and take-up reels in the cassette turn in opposite directions during playback, fast-forward, and rewind: one reel would run clockwise while the other would run counter-clockwise. A locking mechanism integral to each cassette case secures the tape hubs during transportation to keep the tape wound tightly on the hubs. Once the cassette is taken off the case, the hubs are free to spin. A spring-loaded tape cover door protects the tape from damage; when the cassette is inserted into the VCR, the door is released and is opened, enabling the VCR mechanism to spool the tape around the spinning video drum. Accidental recording is prevented by the absence of a red plastic button fitted to a hole on the bottom surface of the tape; removal of the button disabled recording.

Then - either make edit points to break up the whole audio file or just straight up delete (extract) the parts of the clip from your sequence that you don't need (leave some heads and tails). Now you can throw your clips from your camera (with audio) into the sequence on V2/A2.

You've got a clear idea, a good visual sample, etc, which is more than many people offer when they request an editor.  That being said, this subreddit is primarily for higher budget work (anything that allows a person to edit as their full-time profession). We typically downvote requests to work for wages that do not conform to this idea.  If you run into resistance here, just understand why.    Try /r/videoediting - which is a subreddit designed for editors who may not be editing as their full-time profession.  You may have better luck finding someone there."
editors,351jst,agent42b,3,Wed May 6 10:31:36 2015 UTC,Thank you for the response. I didn't really know if i was posting in the correct sub reddit for this sort of the thing. Anyway thanks again for pointing me in the right direction.
editors,351jst,scealfada,4,Wed May 6 10:50:56 2015 UTC,"I'd also suggest you don't look for straight up editors. Even in the video you yourself posted there is a certain amount of motion graphics, which does not fall under the remit of a straight up editor.  If you want 3D graphics in your videos, you need to say that. If you want 2.5D or 2D even, you probably need to say that too.  If you are doing the layout of those titles, then that is a lot of work off their hands. However if they have to create new layouts, or tile or whatever you need inserted into the video then it needs to be clear to them what exactly your are looking for.  I agree with the above poster that you have really put effort into finding out things before posting. However I would be even more specific and mention the following things(as an example):  -I have all audio recorded to a high standard. -Audio is unedited, but a script is provided, and you can edit to that. -I have graphical images of the guns, and text to be put on screen. -I do not have graphical tiles or titles with said text included. These must be created from scratch. -I want 2.5D effects for the opening logo and for when we transition from one section of the video to the next. -etc  I hope this is helpful. Some of this of course will be worked out later, but these are answers to the kinds of things that I ask a client before agreeing to work for them. When people know that they will or won't have to do 3D or 2D animation, it makes everything a little easier for them. The same with other examples I gave. I, for instances, have almost no 3D animation skills, and can only really use someone else's 3D in my projects. Right now I don't know if that would be an issue for you or not, because it isn't completely clear from the examples you posted."

Nest our existing video in the middle of it, scaling it down to fit the 1080 width. Use the upper and lower areas for our graphics.  Output is a little trickier. Either you need a computer connected to the display (one that can spin the system 90 degrees...) or you need your output to be rotated 90 degrees.

editors,34v9b4,Kichigai,2,Tue May 5 00:34:26 2015 UTC,"This is pretty niche, but I think I know what you're asking about. You want something that looks like this, right? And in this display one or both of the videos may change as the video does, right? We do this for some of our clients where we recycle some of their video content into 9:16 containers and the videos animate in and all that.  Offhand, I can't directly link to any examples myself, but I do know that Walmart is using 9:16 displays. Different areas have different content, so some of them are wholly unique for this type of display, others are adaptations of the content on their 16:9 screens that fit the 9:16 orientation. So consider stopping into one of their stores and see if you can find one.  If you're going to have stuff animating in and out then your best bet for production would be to produce it all in After Effects or something and kick it out as a loop. However if you're just doing simple cuts and fades, and you don't want to render it all out as a video, consider looking at something like the Brightsign Player. You can set up programmable zones so you can have a video playing in one zone while an image loads up in the next. We've got one set up in our office which shows our logo, a clip from the various pieces we've done, and accompanying title cards that match the video.

editors,34te1q,ssmssm,7,Mon May 4 13:18:33 2015 UTC,"Offline editing involves using lower resolution material. This gives the editor improved speed and stability. Formats like ProRes Proxy and Avid DNxHD 36 are considered offline formats.   Online editing is editing done using the source material or the highest resolution needed for delivery. If you shoot Red 5K, for example, editing using the original R3D files is an online edit.   Conforming is the process of rebuilding the offline edit using the online material. The offline editor finishes his edit and gives a reference Quicktime file to the online editors along with an XML, AAF, or EDL. These files allow the online editors to import a sequence and reconnect the files to the higher resolution material. Suppose the editor had a beefy system and only did an edit with the original material, he/she may still need to have the picture conformed in a color and/or VFX application.   Keep in mind that offline and online also refer to the general steps in the post production process. Offline speaks solely of a story edit: rough cut and strings and picture lock. Online refers to things that happen after picture lock: VFX, color correction, conforming. Because of digital technology now, these can often happen concurrently, which is somewhat a nightmare when shots shift as the VFX team is working on them."

Adobe is deliberatively overriding it, to force you to use their h264/MPEG4 encoder (which is the MainConcepts encoder, which is better than the Apple one.)  I just tried a workaround - install x264 and that doesn't show up in AME either. I hoped a third party 264 encoder would get around it...but it doesn't even show up.  I get what why you're doing this - to embed subtitles; fwiw, you should be able to set it as a sidecar to Adobe's MPEG4 implementation - and I think that'll be an SCC file. Some places (like Youtube accept .SCC files.)  My real workaround (and I don't know that it will preserve the closed captioning) would be to export ProRes and encode somewhere else. The new (4.2) version of Compressor will let you get to the full codec settings AND can embed the .SCC closed caption file.  I haven't tested it with h264/MPEG4 - but I need to later this week."

No rendering necessary, as it committed your edits and rendered them as soon as you pressed The Button.  So let's say I took a segment of my clip and put it into my timeline. It would separate that segment out into its own file and that's how it would be referenced from then on out. The remaining pieces would be their own clips as well. Since iMovie (at that time) only offered a clip list, and no bins or folders or metadata for organization things could rapidly get out of hand for larger projects. This should also explain why iMovie really only worked with DV footage in the early days, and would convert any non-DV footage on import.  If you made any adjustments to it, like color or contrast or whatever it would be rendered in place to the same file.  Where it really got fun was if you used transitions. The segment of your clip where the transition took place would be split out into a separate file and then the transition would be rendered on top of it and in place.  Oh, and if you deleted a clip, you deleted it. And I mean out of the timeline. If you wanted to remove it from the timeline and not delete the file you had to move it back to the clip list.

We had a client that wanted us to produce a sort of drag-and-drop production system and we were basically producing iMovie templates to make it happen.   one of my tutors explaining that one time, he got some footage and he couldn't open it in Premiere, FCP or AVID and that it would only open in iMovie, so he had to import it into iMovie then export it into a codec/wrapper that AVID would recognise!   Uhm, that seems extremely unlikely, especially since iMovie is basically just a front-end for Quartz Composer and QuickTime, and for the most part so is Final Cut Pro. So if iMovie could open it then FCP should have been able to as well.  And both Avid and Premiere will utilize Quicktime libraries to access media when necessary as well, so these shouldn't have had any issue reading it either.  My bet is what happened is they were missing a plugin to support whatever footage they had. So my guess is that it was an AVCHD camera, which iMovie supports out of the box, but earlier versions of FCP, Media Composer and Premiere required a (free) plug-in to utilize.  The worst part about it is that iMovie defaults to kick out H.264 that's generally best for web consumption, and if your tutor hadn't been careful and used custom export settings they may have dramatically reduced the quality of their footage in the conversion process.  If this had been some truly esoteric stuff I probably would have just washed it through ffmpeg which can kick out ProRes and DNxHD natively and is easily scripted for automation."

All you can do is politely make your case for why you don't think it's working. If the client is experienced, they've interacted/collaborated with an editor before and this won't be shocking to them.

The 2-pop is great for figuring out what went wrong when someone screwed up.  Your vision of a 2-popless world relies on everyone doing everything the same.  With 2-pops if someone screws up the timecode or countdown, but didn't actually screw up the editing/mix, it can be easily and quickly remedied.  As long as the 2-pop and tail pop match up, you know at least everyone has the right duration and sample/frame rates.  It's a big plus when you're trying to figure out a sync problem.    Likewise, if the pops don't match, you know you have to figure that out first.  Sometimes it's very clear that there is a rate mismatch, or someone was working with the wrong version of the project, etc."

The only reason HDCAM is still around, and not completely supplanted by HDCAM-SR, is because it's cheaper, everyone has already blown their load on the gear, and by the time it goes out over the air or to the headend it'll have been so butchered in transmission that no one will see the difference."

It doesn't mean anyone is right or wrong, and you have to take their thoughts with a grain (or a shaker) of salt. If their thoughts aren't constructive, get meta and figure out why they reacted the way they did.  This doesn't mean you have to appease everyone, either. If one person in a room says ""I hated that shot"" and the other twenty didn't react/weren't bothered, then don't just change it to sate the one person. Figure out if and how the feedback meshes with what you want to say, and go from there.  In regards to body language, I've found it's best to dutifully take down the notes people give. Ask clarifying questions only if you're truly unclear what the person means, and don't offer alternatives to try and win praise.

I really try to stay simple and don't try to come up with experimental ways to tell the story. I wait to do that after I have it laid out in a simple way. That way it is easier to see relationships between segments and maybe later decide to invert and mix around some parts of the story.  Basically - you gotta find pieces that fit together nicely.

There's only four people including myself (soon to be three) working on this show. The HDV footage was shot months ago and the coverage and overall quality is pretty bad.   For instance I was working on a scene where someone was in front of a crowd giving a Q&A talk and in one moment someone tells a joke and the everyone starts laughing, but the next shot launches into an emotional talk about the guy's issues. There's no breathing room and I don't have many cutaways to work with. All I could think of to do was to stretch it out a bit and add an audience shot where they were sorta laughing and do a sort of j cut of the guy starting his talk with a slightly emotional music bed beneath it.... It kinda worked but I was really happy with it."

editors,3492ne,SharpTenor,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:53:32 2015 UTC,"Smash cut:       A smash cut is a technique in film and other moving picture media where one scene abruptly cuts to another for æsthetic, narrative, or emotional purpose. To this end, the smash cut usually occurs at a crucial moment in a scene where a cut would not be expected. To heighten the impact of the cut, a disparity in the type of scene on either side of the cut is often present, going from a fast-paced frenzied scene to a tranquil one, or going from a pleasant scene to a tense one, for example.  A clichéd use of a smash cut is in a murder scene: the killer bring a knife plunging down into his victim, and just before the blade pierces the skin, the scene is suddenly replaced with a non-violent use of a cutting edge, such as the chopping of vegetables. Smash cuts are often used when a character wakes up from a nightmare to simulate the jarring nature of that experience.  Smash cutting can also be used to comedic effect; for example, directly after a prediction is made, cutting to the future showing the prediction to have been humorously, and often outlandishly wrong. One specific variety of smash cut is know as a Gilligan cut, so named for the TV show Gilligan's Island which frequently depicted a given character resolutely declaring his or her intentions immediately before a cut to a scene depicting the character doing the exact opposite.

editors,34apk7,JTW24,2,Wed Apr 29 19:30:08 2015 UTC,If your computer is up for the task then it comes down to schedule. Is the post schedule so tight that you don't have time to convert a set of offline files and spend the time to do online finishing? How does that amount of time compare to the time you'll waste rendering the timeline/exporting review versions in 4k?  This is why many productions function with online quality intermediates. If the show needs to be delivered in 1080 then you can bring the high performing intermediates through the whole process with the exception of a few clips that may need to be zoomed or need the full res for VFX. This strategy may become obsolete once we move to 4k/UHD delivery but it's sound for now.
editors,34apk7,kissmyrobot,2,Wed Apr 29 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"Well, you won't have to online later I guess. You have expertise in this though, so perhaps you could state your case as to why this won't benefit the edit process.   Have they mentioned why they want to edit in 4k all the way through?  I've only done it once for a small job, and it was mostly to see how the edit process went and so that my graphics team could work on compositing their work with the 4k outputs of my edits.  Editing went fine (it probably hurt editing tbh, because I had to keep playback at 1/8 res or lower), but it all fell apart when trying to grade XDCAM footage in Speedgrade (Which I found out was because Speedgrade really really didn't like XDCAM footage... decided to send from PPRO as DPX)."

editors,34b6q1,not_kewl,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:26:26 2015 UTC,"I have source footage at 23.976 (which my sequence is set to) and source footage at 59.94. I can drag the 59.94 into the sequence and Premier will auto-convert it—BUT—it looks super jumpy on playback.   It is what it is. That's why you should always shoot everything at the same frame rate. Your best alternative is to change your sequence to 59.94, but then your 23.976 footage will look out of place.   So, is there a better way for me to convert perhaps before bringing it into Premier in the first place?   Maybe Media Encoder, or a hardware solution like a AJA FS2 or a Blackmagic Teranex. Otherwise most of the results will look similar. I'd recommend rendering your sequence before making a judgement call, though. Frame rate conversion like this (going from high frame rate source to low frame rate destination) involves dropping frames and I'd wager that in an unrendered sequence Premiere is just doing it the quickest way possible, not the best way possible.   (I also have some footage at 23.72 that I'd like to use.)   No you don't. You have variable frame rate footage you'd like to use. When you see a frame rate number that's oh-so-very nonstandard like that what you're seeing is the average frame rate of the footage. Premiere (like most non-linear editors) doesn't play well with VFR footage, so you'll have to convert it to a constant frame rate format upstream (before Premiere).  I might recommend making the frame rate of your footage 29.97 as I'll bet there are times where the frame rate goes over 23.976. To minimize quality loss I recommend using DNxHD, ProRes, or Cineform. If you must, you can use H.264 at high bitrates or a Constant Quality factor of 16 or higher. I recommend using ffmpeg for format conversion (it does a good job and plays nice with VFR) or Handbrake (with the above stipulations about H.264) if the command line is a little more than you'd like to get into (or you can't find a GUI for ffmpeg you can use). MPEG Streamclip (which uses Quicktime as its core) may be able to handle this, but don't quote me 100% on that."

editors,348iym,EditorD,2,Wed Apr 29 04:16:52 2015 UTC,"So as said already, buildapc sub!  Currently there are a few main PC architectures that you'd be interested in, so the first thing you need to decide is what base to build on, if you will. These are...  Intel Xeon Intel i7 4th Gen (eg 4790(k)) Intel i7 5th Gen (eg 5960(x))  In very simple terms, the 4th Gen processors are faster per individual core and use DDR3 RAM technology, making them good for gaming, as many games don't support using multiple processor threads well, and don't need crazy fast RAM.  The 5th gen processors have more cores that collectively are faster than a 4th gen. It also uses DDR4 RAM. this is good for processing, encoding, etc.  So, basically, when you ask over at Buildapc you will get lots of different responses on those platforms. There's no right or wrong answer, it's all down to cost etc.  My opinion, you want a 5th Gen Intel processor (like a 5960) and as much DDR4 RAM as you can afford to stuff in there (you can afford 128gb? Great, do it). Get a very good power supply (DON'T be tempted to skimp on the PSU, it's not worth the risk), some large SSD drives (500gb min) to install Windows on, and finally an nVidia graphics card. You want CUDA support for Adobe products, and it's only available on nVidia cards. Personally I don't think Quadro cards are necessary - their price to performance is absurd. Instead, a GTX980 will easy deal with all your Premiere Pro, After Effects rendering. Not sure how Premiere works with SLI (2 graphics cards) but worth a look."

Premiere CS5 was a dramatic upgrade, both in H.264 playback performance, as well being less prone to weird bugs/crashes. If you can source a copy of CS5 or 5.5, your hardware requirements won't have to increase much beyond what you have now.  Otherwise, I would recommend you budget an annual purchase of Adobe CC, and then purchase a Dell Precision workstation.

Import all your original media through the import media window, making sure ""Leave files in place"" is checked and ""Generate Proxy Media"" is checked. Wait for the background tasks to end. This is FCPX generating your media. Close FCPX, eject your personal drive and open up your Library on your personal computer. All your media will appear missing, but if you select ""Proxy Media"" from the viewer dropdown it will all reappear. When you go back to your work computer, select ""Original media.""

And  I can see how I can use the media using this method, but how do I go about working on a sequence at home (and having all my media organized the same way) then coming in to work, switching the drive out and working on the same sequence??

The organization of your media in FCPX does not change. Even though you are working off of two sets of media, in FCPX it looks like one set. Each clip will have an original version that it links to on your work drive and a proxy version that it links to on your personal drive. You can confirm what types of media each clip has available by looking at its Info in the Inspector tab.  Which file a clip in FCPX points to depends on whether you are in proxy or original media mode. As soon as you select one mode or the other, all the clips in FCPX switch to pointing to the version of the file you want to work with. You're just organizing pointers, not the actual files. If you move or keyword a proxy clip in FCPX, it also moves or keywords the original media in FCPX.   This is what makes this method superior to the traditional way of simply relinking to different versions of media when you switch between proxy and original. FCPX knows when you are working with one or the other and keeps everything identical in both modes."

So I am not able to work on the material at home, email myself a small file and reconnect to the material on the work drive? I can only work on one library file at a time? I am sure it has its advantages, but coming from other NLEs, this seems like a pain in the ass. Having to keep my personal drive with me at all times more or less defeats the whole purpose - ideally Id like to leave the drive at home and only have to switch media, and keep going right where I left off.

So I am not able to work on the material at home, email myself a small file and reconnect to the material on the work drive? I can only work on one library file at a time?   If you don't want to bring the drive back and forth, you can send yourself an XML version of your latest timeline each time you switch. ""Export XML"" is under the File Menu.

Answering your question, no I do not have space on my computer, otherwise I'd just edit it all on the personal computer.   So ideal scenario for me would be: At the end of the day work drive gets handed off to assistants. I go home and keep working on my own sequences. Next day I show up, bring in my sequence, somehow incorporate the assistants work as well as all the new media, and keep working.

editors,34594p,jonjiv,2,Tue Apr 28 18:36:05 2015 UTC,"Hey, you keep adding new information that makes your problem more and more complicated, haha. This would be an insanely annoying process in any NLE with the addition of an AE constantly reorganizing your project and adding footage each day. Even with an AVID ISIS system, you're screwed once you try to take the project home. Everything new on the server must be moved home with you.  If you're going to be getting new footage and an updated Library each day, you absolutely need to bring your personal hard drive with you each day. You can't just email yourself GB's of new footage every time it comes in.  Given your new information, I would not recommend using FCPX's proxy media. You would have to move all the same proxy media to your drive every single day, or re-generate it every single day if you want a copy of your AE's new Library to work off of each night.   Make sure your AE is referencing all media in their FCPX Library. This will keep the Library size slim. You are going to have to copy it to your personal drive every night, so it needs to be as small as possible. This includes render files and other generated media. They can change where these files are stored in ""Library Properties"" in the inspector tab when you have the Library selected. Generate proxy files using another program like Adobe Media Encoder or Compressor. Make sure the resolutions, frame rate and file names don't change. Dump these files onto your personal drive. You'll have to do this each time you get new footage. If you have the space and a fast enough drive, I would say screw proxies all together and just copy the original media to your personal drive. Proxies are going to waste time. Copy the AE's latest FCPX Library to your personal drive. Open up the Library copy from your personal drive and Relink Media to your locally stored proxies. Edit your footage. Export an XML of your timeline before you go back to work. Open up the AE's most recent Library. Import the XML of last night's work. Relink media back to original media (might not have to do this since its the AE's Library). Delete the old FCPX Library on your personal drive. Copy the new Library to your personal drive. Repeat.   Note: If you change the organization of your media in FCPX, you must give your new version of the Library back to the AE before they do more work, otherwise your changes will be lost."

You should check if your school has labs though, my school requires you pay a lab fee for some courses so even though I have my own equipment I have to pay the lab fee even if I don't use it. The money you're looking at spending on a laptop now would be better spent later on when you'd be doing more complicated things and also looking at transitioning into the workforce and having to rely completely on what you own. If your school doesn't provide labs with the equipment then I would go for a laptop/desktop now. Otherwise I would wait until you feel more comfortable in knowing what equipment you need for your purposes and software since the luxury of your school maintaining the computers and software is more beneficial early in your degree."

We have our project and autosave files stored with OwnCloud, an open source server application similar to DropBox so those are stored locally + on a local server and then we have a 18TB (usable space) RAID10 array attached to one workstation acting as server to the other one or two active workstations through 1gig ethernet.   I feel like three workstations is max for this setup without getting into a more intense SAN/Fiber setup but Premiere handles just fine under the assumption that the project is only open in one workstation at a time (Not quite as nice as using Avid where you can move bins from an AE machine to the main machine) as Premiere doesn't really have facilities to lock partial portions of the project. Render cache is stored on the shared RAID and behaves well (Make sure if you're using windows that all workstations use/map the shared storage to the same drive letter, mac is less of a headache about this)"

If you are grading in Avid without an external broadcast monitor, you are probably crushing the blacks and clipping the highlights.  One quick fix is to use an adjustment for the whole picture that raises the blacks to 16 and lowers the whites to 235. This is easy using the output levels. Then export using RGB option which tells Avid to expand the levels back to 0-255, which is what you want for computer viewing.  EDIT: When you transcode for Avid, you should do an adjustment to raise full range levels to video levels (it's in the source settings if you did AMA transcoding). It will look flat in Avid but correct when you export RGB. This is how I work. I avoid doing 709 exports for client stuff since a bunch of compression programs seem to prefer RGB."

editors,3446nr,richardtate,5,Tue Apr 28 03:58:38 2015 UTC,"Here's the scoop: as we all know video color gamut is Rec. 709 in the HD world (16-235 range on your RGB sliders), but on computers this can be color represented as full-range RGB (0-255). These are your out-of-gamut or illegal colors.  H.264 is capable of storing both Rec. 709 and full RGB color, but for the most part in the real world there is no standardized way of handling it. Officially there is a flag that can be indicated in MP4 and MOV to indicate what the color space is supposed to be, but for the most part it's not often used, and in some situations in playback it's even ignored.  So this puts you in the wild west. Some programs assume your H.264 is full range RGB, so it doesn't compensate and re-expand the gamma curve, making color look washed out. Others assume your H.264 is Rec. 709, and will automatically expand the curve, blowing things out.  Your best bet is to just re-import your H.264 back into Premiere and compare it against what you saw in your sequence. If it matches, then you're good."
editors,3446nr,Kichigai,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:53:12 2015 UTC,"Okay so maybe this can be solved with the ""data/video levels"" selection in resolve.

It doesn't always happen, but it does sometimes and makes me go nuts."
editors,3446nr,wrosecrans,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:08:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, ""data"" levels are full range (0-255 in 8 bit) and ""video"" levels are reduced range (16-235 in 8 bit.)

Others assume your H.264 is Rec. 709, and will automatically expand the curve, blowing things out.   Range correction is a linear operation, so if an app is adjusting gamma to compensate for it, that wouldn't be correct.  You go to full range in 8 bit by subtracting 16, and multiplying by (255.0/219.0).

The shift could be anywhere in that chain, and might look completely different with the same browser on a different OS, or a different browser on the same computer.  If I bring up a video side by side in VLC and QuickTime player on the same machine, it often looks quite different between the two apps, but that doesn't automatically indicate an error was made when creating the file.

That was a solid move and their software was great. I hope this goes through so A) the guys at The Foundry can get paid and B) more people can use their tech to make cool stuff.

editors,340rsx,Qbeck,4,Mon Apr 27 13:59:24 2015 UTC,"Well, here's the thing you should know about timecode: it's simply a way of providing a human-readable unique identifier (relatively speaking) to every given frame that exists on a tape or in a clip.  And the thing is that most non-linear editing systems have to do this anyway, so they kind of fake timecode for any clips that don't natively have timecode.  That's how you can jump to one minute, twelve seconds and three frames and always get the exact same image.  Where things get goofy with timecode is drop-frame timecode, which exists in 29.97 video. Perhaps Apple phrased it best in their documentation, where they simplify it as ""every minute except each tenth minute, two timecode numbers are dropped from the timecode count."""

editors,340rsx,PKD00fuss,2,Mon Apr 27 15:24:36 2015 UTC,In addition to the other comment is your project in RGB or YCbCr? If your export is in a different color space than your media composer project that could be your problem.

Second, export via MC and then immediately re-import/AMA link. Is there a gamma shift? QuickTime7 is a dog for getting the gamma right.  Third, make sure you're exporting out a QuickTime ref at 709 to Sorenson.  Last, reach out via your subscription (if you have one) directly to Avid. This is something that should be 100% solid."

editors,341qax,Hawkman10016,8,Mon Apr 27 16:53:28 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that's a big question. Trailers are definitely a distinct discipline. I'm actually at work right now, so I can't get too deep into it. But I'll try and lay out the basics of my process.  Your breakdown (selects, basically) is everything. It's the most boring & tedious part of the process, but if you take your time and do it right it will pay off like a motherfucker down the line. I usually start with two sequences, one for visuals and one for dialogue. I'll go through the movie and pull out any line or any shot that might come in handy. This part is very broad strokes, don't over think it. I usually end up with 20-30 minutes worth of material on both sequences.   After you have your initial selects, organize them. Establishing shots, action shots, iso shots of any given character, etc. Same for dialogue, each character's lines, lines where other people are talking about your lead characters, plot specific, non-sequitors, etc. Like I said, it's a pretty monotonous process. But once you're through it you'll not only have a much easier time finding the content you need, you'll know the movie like the back of your hand. ""hmmm, I need a shot of Keanu looking angsty at night."" Instead of spending 30 minutes looking for that shot, you'll know right away if you have it and where it is. Extrapolate that out to the 1,000 different choices you have to make in a trailer and you'll see why an organized, thorough breakdown is essential.  Now start looking for music. What serves the piece best? Do you have money for a known song? If not, reference some well known trailer music libraries. There's a lot of shite music out there, but you'd be surprised by the quality of some of the stuff you can get for cheap. Check out 5 Alarm, Brand X, HiFinesse, and SenciT…all great libraries that won't cost you an arm and a leg.  Traditionally, trailers are laid out in 3 acts. They don't have to be, but 90% of them are cut that way for a reason. Pick three tunes for your three acts and lay out a sound bed. Then start constructing what we refer to as ""pods"". Pods are basically little scenes…the three or four line exchanges between characters in a trailer. Something super-key to the plot that you're not sure where it goes but feel like it's likely that you'll use it? Construct a pod and come back to it later.  Shit, this is getting long and I have to get going for now. To over-simplistically sum up the rest, basically just start constructing your piece. Try to get all your beats and story points in place before you start working on your coverage/shots. If you decide to make fundamental changes to your piece, duplicate the sequence. Save every version…you'll end up at v20 and realize that that bit you discarded from v4 because it wasn't working suddenly would be really handy to have now. Also, always try to look at it with fresh eyes. You'll be intimately familiar with the material and certain leaps of logic will make sense to you, but will they to the first time viewer?  Also, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of sound design. Sound design is primarily what sets a baller trailer apart from a ""next time on…"" promo for a tv show. drum rolls, cymbals, rises, suckbacks, hits are your best friends when working on a trailer. And use dynamics to your advantage. if no one is speaking, fill the empty space with sound, be it music or sound design. Trailers that don't fully utilize dynamics feel so, so flat.  Gotta go, sorry. Good luck with this, and have fun. Cutting trailers is very hard to do well, but it's fun as hell. Feel free to message me with any questions or if you want feedback."

editors,341qax,AsimovsRobot,2,Tue Apr 28 08:54:10 2015 UTC,There are a million ways you can go about doing this. You can start from a piece of dialogue or music selection. Or write a script. Really depends on what kind of nervous you'll be using to build the story up. I generally look for that unique piece of footage that I love instantly. Then build around it. Or I may have graphics in mind and go from there. Or whatever really. Just dive into it and you will find your way around.

editors,341qax,urbanplowboy,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:27:23 2015 UTC,"Granted, I've only ever cut one trailer for a super low budget film, but here's my tips anyway:   Mark any and all interesting/good looking shots. Any shots with high production value or exceptional cinematography, etc. Any good shots of the main characters. Any establishing shots of locations in the movie. Even if they're not necessary to ""tell your story"", if they're nice to look at, they might be good in the trailer. Mark any soundbites that have anything to do with character descriptions, character motivations, plot descriptions, etc. Generally, soundbites will be the backbone of the narrative you will be creating. Once you have all your potential clips and soundbites (ideally you should have way more to choose from than you could ever fit in the trailer), hopefully at this point you can begin forming an idea of how you can fit all the pieces together, and whittle down your clips and soundbites little by little. At this point, you probably want to have at least a couple of music tracks selected and see how they work with the clips and soundbites. Make sure the tone and pacing is appropriate for how everything. Pick the one that works the best (also, don't forget that you can change up the music during the trailer, and sometimes you'll need to edit the hell out of your music to make it work) and from there edit your clips and soundbites tightly to the music. Unless you're deliberately trying to keep is slowly paced, try to keep everything moving quickly. Fast cuts and nice tight editing. Lastly, I'll just add that before fine-tuning the trailer, watch the movie one more time to make sure there aren't any other shots or soundbites that you may have overlooked before. It's okay to use shots from the third act, but try to use mostly content from the first and second acts (before the main conflict) so that you don't give away too much."

Technology and codecs are always changing which means 100 yrs from now it could be really difficult to restore any of tbism  Film is great because it's fairly universal but it has to be stored very carefully and the only ones who can afford that are big studios etc etc.  Lots of info out there regarding this.

editors,33z6j5,wrosecrans,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:17:51 2015 UTC,"Film preservation:       Film preservation, or film restoration, describes a series of ongoing efforts among film historians, archivists, museums, cinematheques, and non-profit organizations to rescue decaying film stock and preserve the images which they contain. In the widest sense, preservation nowadays assures that a movie will continue to exist in as close to its original form as possible.   For many years the term 'preservation' was synonymous with 'duplication' of film. The goal of a preservationist was to create a durable copy without any significant loss of quality. In more modern terms, film preservation now includes the concepts of handling, duplication, storage, and access. The archivist seeks to protect the film and share the content with the public.   Film preservation is not to be confused with film revisionism, in which long-completed films are subjected to outtakes never previously seen being inserted, newly inserted music scores or sound effects being added, black-and-white film being colorized or converted to Dolby stereo, or minor edits and other cosmetic changes being made.

editors,33z6j5,Kichigai,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:18:09 2015 UTC,"I've been looking for something that show's the reliability of storing on film than on a hard drive but I can't find anything.   It's almost impossible to make a direct comparison, since the failure modes are very different.  Film degrades gradually.  After five minutes, it's slightly worse than it was when it was printed.  Not a lot.  Not enough to notice.  but it's always degrading, and you'll never get exactly the same thing out of it as you put into it.  Bits on a hard drive can be exact.  Over time, there may be some bit errors, or the hard drive may fail, but until that happens, you get out of the hard drive exactly what you put into it.  You can easily find estimates for how many years film looks ""good enough"" and you get get estimates for bit errors on hard drives.  I just don't know how you'd compare the two.  In any event, if you store a film on a hard drive in some storage cluster, you don't really care about how long a hard drive lasts.  That's just a labor cost of spending some time every X days to replace a failed drive in one of the RAID arrays.  It's a pretty normal event.  It's annoying when lots of drives pop in a short span, but not a show stopper.  I generally don't even bother to notify users that a piece of storage they are using had a failed drive.  As a result, the data is over time being copied to newer and newer drives as a part of the storage process.  If you want it offline on a shelf rather than kept accessible, it's typically on tape rather than a hard drive.  Tape is typically shelf stable for years without any problems.  You still want multiple copies, and some sort of forward migration plan, but it's less babysitting.  When you have a vault full of LTO-4 tapes, and you are considering when you are going to retire your last LTO-6 drives, you need to make sure you migrate your old tapes before you retire the last drive that can read them.  LTO will read the two previous generations, so upgrading to LTO-7 will mean needing to clear out the vault of LTO-4 tapes.  The fun part is that moving that many generations forward would mean putting 8 old tapes onto each new tape, so you can cut down on your storage space used in the vault to make room for new stuff.  Given that the hardware is ""some sort of redundant post-RAID cluster"" for online and ""tape"" for offline archiving, the tech specs of the storage are uninteresting.  Whether your Isilon cluster uses SAS or SATA drives, that the SAN is FibreChannel attached, or that your Igloos use ZFS just doesn't matter.  You can get to your data over a network.  The rest is transient implementation details that will probably change when you migrate to something bigger/better/faster/quieter in X years.  You can swap in completely different hardware and never change anything that really matters.  You just copy data from the old box to the new one over the network, and network protocols appropriately isolate your applications from low level hardware details.  What does matter is the data.  If you use a proprietary codec, you will eventually be hosed.  If you store an encrypted DCP, you had better make damn sure you can keep track of the decryption keys.  What color space is it all in?  Do you need to keep the raw material to recreate visual effects, or do you only need finished shots?  Do you keep vendor proprietary camera raw files, or do you archives to transcoded DPX sequences?  How do you organise the directory structure?  Are you using tar or NetBackup, or some other backup utility with a special tape format?  How do you keep track of what's on which tape?  Do you need tape numbers to be in a single namespace across multiple sites?  Or can you just start numbering your tapes from 00001, and count up from there?  Do you include the Premiere project file used to edit?  Export to something standard like XML or EDL?  Which EDL dialect do you use?  Do you take a dump of the Baselight database so you can revisit the color correction?  Do you keep track of what version of all the software was used?  On a shot by shot basis?  Maybe the first act was rendered with RenderMan version X and version Y of the internal shader library, but p[art way through production there was a software upgrade to X+1 and Y+1.  If you re-render the first act using the newer shaders and newer renderer, it might look very different.  Software, file formats, pipeline details, metadata, and that sort of thing are 99.5% of what is interesting about archiving."
editors,33z6j5,Kichigai,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:18:54 2015 UTC,"urgent help (…) I'm currently doing a presentation   Err, you probably should have started your research earlier.  Do research on different data buses (USB, FireWire, SATA/eSATA, Thunderbolt, Fibre Channel, Infiniband, and Ethernet are the big ones), different drive buses (SATA, SCSI, and SAS are the ones used), and different RAID configurations (RAID0, 1, 5, 6, 10, 50, 60, and ZFS).   I've been looking for something that show's the reliability of storing on film than on a hard drive but I can't find anything.   You're looking for the wrong info. These days almost everything is digital. Just look up the lifespan of film and its vulnerabilities versus disks. Archival and backup media of choice tends to be data tape, like LTO.  Stuff used to be stored on film because source media used to be film, and digital systems used no to be able to match film in terms of resolution or fidelity, or if it did it was completely unreasonable. Hell, 4K film scanners are still a relatively new thing.  Still, a lot of films were produced entirely digitally, like Attack of the Clones which was produced in 1080p. So it's kind of a mixed bag, truthfully."

Unless your audience is of the technical sort, this whole part will be way over their heads. You're better off focusing on generalized concepts of what these storage methods are, and their benefits and drawbacks, and then the primary reason why they were chosen.  So focus on how primary, secondary, and offline storage came into the picture and why they were preferred. Generally, in bigger facilities, data is stored in online, nearline, and offline/archival levels.  Online is the biggest baddest storage system, but storage space is at a premium. These are the RAID arrays and SANs that people are actively working off of. This is the hardware used when you're constantly accessing stuff and you need it available now, not in 3-4 days.  Stuff that might be referenced in the near future, but in situations where it isn't so important it be made available quickly (in the 1-24 hours range, generally), nearline storage is used. So recently finished pieces where someone might want to go back in and cut things up to produce a promo for the DVD, or make a blooper reel or something.  Archival is where total lifespan of the media itself is the highest priority. This is the stuff that goes on a shelf in a vault for 20 years before someone has to go back there to pull it back out for whatever reason. Archival media is produced as soon as a project is done, and like everything else, it is properly backed up.  Now, backup is a whole other field you can touch on. Good IT professionals will reference the 3, 2, 1 rule. Three copies of the data, in two different formats (e.g. RAID vs. single hard disks vs. tapes), with at least one copy off-site (off-site generally meaning far enough away that the most likely natural disaster won't ruin both copies).  So now we start talking about things like Backup rotation schemes for things like disks and tapes, and high speed data transfer protocols like Aspera's Fasp and Signiant's Media Shuttle for moving lots of data over the Internet ASAP. Talk about why that's important (things like accidentally backing up a corrupted version of a file) and ways to accelerate backups without compromising integrity (like snapshots).   to take me up to the cap of 10 minutes.

Most of what I've learned has come from, crazy enough, drilling down into the Wikipedia. While a lot of the questions you're asking about are straying further into IT than editing (in big studio editing environments editors can become more focused on what they're doing than the underlying hardware that makes it possible) the Wikipedia knows no such boundaries.  I know a lot of academic environments frown on using the Wikipedia as a source, but what I liked to do when I needed to was to find what I needed on the Wikipedia and chase it back to the source the Wikipedia used. From there I would ensure that the source agreed with what was said on the Wikipedia, and then utilize Wikipedia's source as my own.  Using the Wikipedia in this way will allow you to jump through many different disciplines and harvest a lot of data in a short amount of time. Just make sure you do a CYA on the sources. If no source is cited, find one lest you get caught in a conundrum of poorly analyzed data."

editors,33v714,MrOverland,3,Sat Apr 25 23:03:23 2015 UTC,Yes that is the total available. There's an internal hub to spawn those ports.
editors,33v714,Kaitology,5,Sun Apr 26 02:14:18 2015 UTC,"Dead on, mostly. While you're right that almost all systems use internal hubs to produce all the USB ports, not all the USB ports may be on the same hub. Generally a system will have multiple USB buses, dedicated to different clusters of ports.  In Windows you can see this by going into your Device Manager and choosing View: By Connections. Drill into your system and you'll see it. The likely path will be ACPI-Compliant System → PCI Bus → USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller (this is where your 5GbPS bus lives) → Root Hub. On my personal computer I have two controllers with a hub each, and judging by what's connected to which I can determine that all the USB ports on the back side of my computer are sharing one 5GbPS bus, and all the ones on the front are sharing another bus.  In Mac OS X you'd find this in the System Profiler (Apple Menu: About this Mac, System Report). Go under USB, and you'll see Buses. Now, if you see multiple devices under a bus that implies that there's a hub connecting them all. So for example, on my old Macbook Pro my keyboard/trackpad assembly and the IR receiver are sharing a bus, and the iSight camera is on another one."
editors,33v714,Kichigai,2,Sun Apr 26 03:15:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I did exactly that. System Profiler, twirled down the hub to see two drives sharing the same bus. Guess I'll get a thunderbolt drive to separate the media with their own bandwidth lanes."

I know it's always said to have a separate external for cache, but if the internal SSD is hitting 650+ MB/s, how much faster would the former be?"
editors,33uof8,kitch2015,5,Sat Apr 25 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"Oh goodness gracious yes. Here's why:  Modern hard disks sit on what's called a SATA (AKA: Serial ATA) bus. It's the bus for communicating directly with hard disks, like the one internally mounted on your Macbook, or one externally mounted using eSATA. If you tore your USB 2.0 drive open you'd find a SATA hard disk inside connected to a controller that translates between SATA and USB Mass Storage Device protocols. That provides anywhere from 1.5GbPS to 6GbPS of throughput, depending on what generation of SATA is being used. For the most part, hard disks cannot achieve those speeds, though SSDs can get pretty close. But modern disks are still pretty quick, so it's not like this is a complete waste or anything.  USB 2.0, however, has a maximum theoretical throughput of 480MbPS. Generally speaking, most modern hard disks are much faster than that, so from the get go, USB 2.0 is really holding you back.  But wait, it gets worse. Note how I emphasized that 480MbPS is a theoretical maximum throughput. In reality USB 2.0 will never ever get near that because of a number of problems. First, because of the way the protocol works there are no guarantees that you'll ever have maximum throughput. It's also dependent on intervention from the CPU to keep on running, so it'll either slow other things down or other things will slow it down. And then there's the hardware in the hard disk that has to translate from Mass Storage protocol to SATA protocol; if it's cheap and slow it'll be easily overwhelmed. In real-world applications I tend to see 200MbPS or slower out of USB hard disks, even on incredibly fast disks and systems with an overabundance of idle CPU cycles.  Where things get weird is that your internal hard disk is doing a lot of things. It's caching data for Media Composer, the OS, and anything running in the background, it's servicing Virtual RAM (AKA: paging) for RAM overflow, and a ton of other little things going on, which eats in to performance.  You should seriously consider using USB 3.0 disks (which provides way more throughput than a hard disk can provide) if possible, otherwise preferred alternatives are eSATA (which is a variant of SATA meant for external use) and Firewire (which is slower than the hard disk, but way faster than USB 2.0) drives. They're a little spendier, and you might need to upgrade your laptop (if it's old enough check out ExpressCard 34 peripherals) but the performance difference will be night and day."

Firewire 400 (IEEE-1394a) trounced USB 2.0 in terms of performance, and its maximum practical bus speed was only about four fifths of what USB 2.0 promised as a maximum theoretical bus speed. I mean, I have a seven year old MacBook Pro and even though the CPU is very often the limiting factor in things, any time USB 2.0 comes into the picture that automatically becomes the bottleneck.  The USB Forum promised 480MbPS, and at no point could it ever deliver. Even now, if you plug a USB 3.0 device into the 2.0 port on a brand new high-end workstation you'll see performance way below the promised maximums.  There's a reason Firewire stuck around in professional audio and video applications for so long, and that was because it could reliably deliver the throughput they promised."

It's not bad, and it's comparable to Aspera Fasp in terms of performance. It's also much cheaper, and has much simpler licensing terms.  Here's what they don't tell you on the website, though: you need to be running a server to use it effectively. Yeah, that's right: you'll need a dedicated system for this. This is because Media Shuttle (like Fasp) is a point-to-point file transfer system. Signiant does not operate an intermediate server that relays all your data, you need to provide that.  Now, the good news is that if you want to, this dedicated system could be a virtual machine, instead of dedicated hardware on-site. Signiant has actually put time and effort into making sure that their software plays nice on Amazon AWS. But this is, again, another cost you're going to have to absorb.  If you're looking to save some money, you might want to look at The Matrx. /u/johnrkennedy mentioned it way back in this comment. According to the comment, The Matrx is using Media Shuttle tech, but what they're offering is that all you have to do is pay for what you use, rather than a blanket license fee. So it's kind of like Hightail or Dropbox, except faster. And your service fees drop significantly when you're not using the service."

Since you mentioned manufacturing your own transitions, after uninstalling Red Giant I ended up doing just that, recreating my own transitions based on the ones I liked the most from RG free package.  To avoid recreating them every time I need one, I use a template project with a single timeline and two sample video clips.  I simply manufacture one transition after another in a single timeline, and when I need one, I open the template as read-only and copy-paste the filters from my template into my project. All of the keyframes are copied along and is just a matter of adjusting them on my project."

Noise Industries (OS X only) has a bunch of plugins + a plugin store.  BCC has some decent ones - and are 'cheaper' via Continuum units.

So I've been working on a project since last monday. Two pretty simple commercials on a very tight budget. Based on that budget, I was originally set to color correct on my own, and had that  internal workflow in mind for the past two weeks. Then, after spending four hours prepping and grading on Wednesday, I came in Thursday morning to discover that the agency had decided to go with an outside post house for color.   I knew this was a possibility, but I had thought their opportunity to go with an outside company had passed, as we needed the color completed (I thought) by yesterday afternoon. Now I had to prep and deliver my project to this company immediately.   I'd never worked with this company before, so I called them up and asked what would be the fastest way to deliver the materials to them. Given the short notice and quick turn-around, they seemed very much inclined to work with conformed sequences for all of the spots. I typically work with .xmls and raw files when I go out-of-house, but I wanted to be accommodating. In my master project, I was working from the master files (.mxf from a Canon 100D), so I simply exported each cut as a DPX sequence from Premiere. We messengered the files an hour later, they received them, and I heard nothing more about it until 11:30 am this morning.  11am was the client's color correct session. 11:24 I get a message from the color correct assist telling me that they just discovered I had only sent them one of the cuts. The other .dpx sequence, though labeled differently, was identical to the first.  Balls.  I have no idea how this happened. I exported one, checked it, exported the next, checked it...and I guess I exported one over the other in process. That's pretty hard to do, but I did it. I fucked that up right there.  Now, I did also send them reference cuts along with the .dpx sequences. With those, I just exported with ""Match Sequence Settings,"" and didn't compress that any further. So far as I can tell, there was really no difference in color space. The only problem there was that the logo was still over picture for the final shot. Still, I could pretty quickly deliver a .dpx sequence of the clean final shot.   I guess that reference cut kind of saved us, but still. I feel like a giant dumbass. As a lone editor with a small company, it certainly doesn't come across very professional. Not the best introduction to a new post place. Given the agency made it clear they weren't excited about me grading the project early on, I rather hope they didn't catch wind of this, either. I mean, I know I won't compare with Co3 (which was not the company I was working with), but to have that little faith in me when we're talking about a project with a budget so small we couldn't afford an assist...the past few days have just been a little disheartening.  Anyway, I'm going to stick with the traditional workflow from here on out. They would have had to load the project before client arrived if it was an .edl, and if that was fucked up it's easy enough to send another .edl through email.  TL;DR: I sent the the same project to color correct twice, just switched the names. And now I feel like shit."

editors,33rcax,fustercluck,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:38:05 2015 UTC,These almost certainly aren't flash frames that are coming from the edit. It's a common bug with Premiere which introduces them during export. From my experience the workarounds are different depending on the source and destination formats.

Seems like the last update fixed it for a good number of users but ours is still persisting. We are on Mac OSX 10.8.5 and running Premiere CC 2014 v8.1 Our primary cameras are C300's so we work with the MXF files natively. To the best of our knowledge these are the three main ingredients that are causing the red flashes.

So I have no idea why the colorist is asking for this.  Sounds like you're done with the project, so let's assume the colorist is using the wrong terminology and wants a reference quicktime. Make sure you burn in timecode to the quicktime (a small window, not huge) so they can make sure the footage that has come over via your XML is still frame accurate.   As a colorist, I like audio in the reference quicktime, but don't need it otherwise."

It goes C500 -> Ki Quad (Record proxy) -> Thunderbolt -> System with fast drives to record RAW.  The cool part is that the Canon software will match file names.

editors,33lozx,2old2care,9,Thu Apr 23 16:31:49 2015 UTC,Generally considered best practice to use good monitor speakers.   Though I know a lot of people that do headphones still.
editors,33lozx,ShortRounnd,4,Thu Apr 23 15:42:08 2015 UTC,Why exactly? Wouldn't headphones give you a much more accurate reading of sound??  And not everyone is going to have the same badass computer speakers as the next guy. Thanks!
editors,33lozx,Woovils,23,Thu Apr 23 15:46:13 2015 UTC,Headphones will give you a false sense of low end and a false sense of loudness. In general they will make the low end sound fuller and also make more subtle sounds sound louder.   I've edited sound on headphones and then listened on speakers and realized I couldn't hear half of the stuff I was hearing on the headphones.
editors,33lozx,BlanketsAndBlankets,11,Thu Apr 23 15:49:27 2015 UTC,Headphones give a false representation of sound. Nowhere in real life will you hear sounds from the left side only with your left ear.
editors,33lozx,AsimovsRobot,2,Thu Apr 23 16:07:33 2015 UTC,"It will give you an ""accurate reading of sound"" ---- from other headphones. Like if you mix for headphones, and then play on the speakers, it sounds different. traditionally people listened to stuff on speakers so they mixed on speakers, although that might be changing now. I've also noticed the mix from speakers to headphones is more subtle. You tend to be more careful with panning & mixing when you're using speakers (and you should be), so when you listen on headphones you're not having as big of a disparity as when you mix with headphones and listen on speakers.  As to the quality, people using junky speakers or headphones will not affect your work. You always want to work on best option possible. I said monitor speakers because they're supposed to give the most accurate equally balanced sound from lows to highs. This means they'll be more expensive, but it's worth it. If you mix on bass heavy headphones and then watch it in a theater, you'll be disappointed with the results."
editors,33lozx,ShortRounnd,5,Thu Apr 23 16:38:55 2015 UTC,well since we're talking about it and this is all news to me ...  Can anyone recommend me decent editing speakers? I'm not really looking to break the bank but I would really be interested in some. Thanks
editors,33lozx,Woovils,2,Thu Apr 23 16:47:09 2015 UTC,"I recommend at least 5"" monitors. 4"" monitors are a bit less expensive but your bass response suffers which makes it more difficult to mix foley and background music.  KRK Rockit 5"" or M-Audio BX5 D2 5"" monitors are common, both around $300 a pair and are powered (you just need a line-level audio signal, no power amp/receiver needed). Mackie also makes a pair around $300 but they're less popular.  For a few hundred more you'll get into brands like Yamaha and Genelec. But some more expensive monitors need amps which can also be a few hundred dollars or more, be aware of that."

editors,33lozx,lazyteeds,2,Thu Apr 23 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"Get a proper pair of used reference monitors.  I got a pair of Yamaha HS-5's on eBay for $220.  They are amazing, not just for sound critical work, but even for just general listening.  You'll need to pick up a proper interface, but again eBay delivered.  A Focusrite 2i2 for $75.

Nine times out of then this is the solution.   Select your HD - make sure you have permission to write there. Everyone must be able to write there too (which is normally a no-no.)   Be very careful when doing this, though. If you're doing this with your boot disk it can, and will, screw a lot of stuff up for you. Media drives, it'll be fine, but if a computer is booting off that disk you'll likely have to reinstall your OS to get everything right again.  Source: I did this once.   Then Select your AvidMediaFiles Folder. Everyone must be able to write here AND then go under the gear and apply to enclosed items.   This, however, is much safer.  The other thing I'd point out is that the Boot Camp drive is likely formatted NTFS, and OS X can't natively write to that anyway."

This involves but is not limited to:   Compressing spots/trailers and posting to FTP or wiredrive sites  Scheduling fiber lines from ATT or Verizon or whatever Inputting and converting footage to appropriate specs Building rough feature assemblies from dailies Organizing the xsan (or whatever shared media drive your shop has) Creating dialogue breakdowns of features to help w/ the editors Searching for stock footage when requested by producers or editors Prep trailers/spots for finish and export appropriate EDL and OMF files.   Less glamorous but equally import are jobs like:   Getting lunch/dinner Going on runs to studios Making shopping runs so there are food/drinks in the office. General office help, like setting up furniture and changing lights, etc.   You will be at the bottom of the ladder, but there is a lot of opportunity if you work hard and are willing to learn.  Nearly everyone in this industry started off as a runner or AE.  It's a lot of work, but luckily you won't be the only AE.  You will probably shadow one for a bit until you get your footing.  And there should be a production manager there who helps supervise the assistants.    While they shouldn't expect you to know how to do everything right off the bat, you should be comfortable with the following:   Working in a fast paced team environment You should know your way around an Avid or FCP system. You should understand the different media formats your agency uses and know how to properly convert files so editors can use them. You should have some sort of background in film and/or editing.   Most AEs I have worked with have come right out of college.  I did when I started.  It can be really overwhelming but don't worry, it's not brain surgery and lives are not at stake.    And finally, if you don't know how to do something or don't understand what is being asked of you, ask!  Something done slowly yet properly is way better than something done quickly yet wrong.  All of this is not exhaustive.  Every agency runs things their own way.  But hopefully this you get a feeling of whats expected.  If you need anything else feel free to ask!"
editors,33io20,runciter_is_dead,2,Wed Apr 22 21:19:48 2015 UTC,"everything on this list: YES. As a current AE in a trailer house this is very accurate, I would say some of the things involving runs and lunch are more of a coordinator job where I work at. it can vary shop to shop."
editors,33io20,i_hate_the_eagles,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"Valid.  We occasionally have interns who do that and just got a PA to free up the AEs from doing these things, but I guess it varies.  Like I said, each shop has their own way of doing things.  A place I once worked at briefly had the editors themselves prep finishes and do cue sheets.  That shit cray."

If I could bother you just a little more- what does a project/session look like after your AE has set it up for you, what do you expect to see/be completed alredy? What I mean is are there typically the dailies organized (location or shot type, or slate etc) or do you typically have a pretty much completed movie that you cut the trailer out of? Thanks!"
editors,33io20,runciter_is_dead,1 point,Thu Apr 23 08:36:53 2015 UTC,"Editors generally set up their own projects in FCP.  AEs do create a blank project for each movie that has sequences in the correct media format, etc.  But that's it!  I haven't worked in Avid for a really long time so perhaps it's different with bins and stuff.    However, AEs do create a filestructure on the xsan.  All you have to do is make sure the media is in the right spot on the server, so when a client is yelling at us to make sure all the VFX shots are up to date editors can find them easily.  Again, just see how the agency does it and replicate that system.  Whether or not we work on a ""completed"" feature varies by job.  If it's a teaser or trailer, you're generally working from dailies.  If you're cutting tv spots, generally it's from a feature.  None of this is 100% though.  JJ Abrams and other big directors don't let studios give out the full feature so you work w/ daily selects the whole way through.  (All the Star Wars work is being done on the Disney lot, and Michael Bay often has editors come and work at his production company).  Smaller movies tend to just be one feature.  And obviously they're still cutting the feature while we're working so often during the course of a campaign there will be multiple feature cuts sent to us.    There's no need to be anxious about it!  The fact that you're asking so much beforehand is a great sign.  It might be stressful work but we're all pretty nice and real assholes are few and far between.  All you have to do is display some level of competence and drive and you'll be fine.

The 7:00;02 is technically right at 7minutes but drops the 00;01 frame to match real-time ""time"". The 30P and 24P clips are progressive so there is no dropped frames or interlaced picture. Since it looks like they want final delivery in a drop frame timecode, I would edit to the 28th frame or the second frame for timing. Unless the network wants the breaks zeroed out, they shouldn't give you too much grief over a single frame. Your breaks will vary with content, so just try to get your segments into a good rough cut, then you can frame f*** your edit to get the timing. Content is key not well balanced timed out segments."

I mean no offense to you personally.    It bothers me that TRT has been conflated with the time of the tape from 1:00:00 including breaks.   Thanks to reality TV and people who don't know the tech side of editorial being in charge and writing network specs TRT now means the length of your show including blacks. It is supposed to mean. ""The time the show is on not including blacks""   The network needs your TRT so they know how long your show will be on their airwaves between their commercials (which is what they really care about). They need to know how many commercials and promos they can fit into the block they have setup for your show.   Tape content time or TCT is the length of the tape from 1:00:00:00 to finish with blacks. But nobody really needs to know that. The editor may need to know what frame to end the show on, but that's about it. Bad Post Supervisors who have never edited are a big reason TRT has two meanings.   TRT is the post production version of the new amazing definition of Literally. That word now means both literally and figuratively which is asinine.   /End rant."

What's your timeline composed of (AMA media, Long GOP media, etc)? Is it rendering the whole timeline, or is it exporting the whole timeline?  Possible solutions:   Have you tried making a sequence with just mixdowns of your media and exporting that? What happens if you break out the segments you need exported separately into their own sequences? Have you tried doing a render to just the segments you need?"

Your barista experience will be very helpful  A friendly email/cover letter plus your CV to as many places (big and small) can get you more interviews than you think. I do find small places better with actual responses while the bigger well known places will lump you with group interviews/trial days.  If a place offers you part time, don't take it. Part time on min wage aint no fun"
editors,33gcdl,cut-it,3,Wed Apr 22 15:54:38 2015 UTC,"Brutal honesty: Focus on the barista part of the CV. This may sound flippant or dismissive but all big post-houses in London essentially use their runners as waiters. You'll be initially fetching tea/coffee/lunches for the Producers and Directors who are their clients. And, as someone in a client facing role, the more you can highlight and sell your customer service skills, the better the chance you'll have of being hired.     As a client who has a say in which Post house my shows are edited, I'd take a runner with a year's barista experience over a runner with a film degree any day. The staff turnaround in London post is enormous - chances are you'll have moved company a couple of times between your first runner's position and your first editor job, so post houses understand investing in you for the future isn't quite so good for them. By all means, talk about your passion for films and your career goals in your interview, but understand the principle reason why you'll be hired. (Good interview question to ask: 'Around my shifts outside of my working hours, will there be a chance for me to learn the business and art of editing? If I were to ask nicely, would some of your current editors be willing to teach me a thing or two?"")  Send you CV to every single post house you can find. But in your cover letter, research some of their bigger shows (should be listed on their website) and mention how much you enjoyed them.   Tips for when you get the runner's job: There's a 'runner-type' you see everywhere. It's the guy/girl who goes on and on about doing anything for a chance at a runner's job. ""I'll give my right arm for a way in!"". Then 6 weeks later, after doing nothing but getting kunches, they moan non-stop about how they haven't been promoted yet. DON'T BE THAT GUY. If you are always happy, always smiling and always wiling to go out in the rain to get good coffee from Flat White in Berwick Street - no matter how long your shift or how long you've been a runner - you'll go far."

editors,33fxi7,KuroKinoko,2,Wed Apr 22 04:56:42 2015 UTC,"Basically it's Premiere Pro with different shortcut keys. The primary differences are audio mixing (an abomination in FCP7) and how it multicams. Multicam in FCP7 is more similar to Avid in that you are only allowed one clip per angle, in comparison to Premiere Pro and FCPX where multicam is, essentially, a nested sequence you can jump back into.  Lynda, I'm sure, has training and I would check out creativecow.net or http://www.lafcpug.org/ for their video tutorials and forums, both have tutorials and training."
editors,33fxi7,kissmyrobot,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:29:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much, creative cow has been awesome. In your experience with FCP7, did you use the offline/online workflow. I feel like transcoding the raw to ProRes 422 HQ should be good enough to edit on, but did you ever go the ProRes proxy then upres for online route? Thanks"
editors,33fxi7,kissmyrobot,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"I've done both. Mostly ProRes standard or HQ through the pipeline is fine; HQ is 10-bit, ~220mb/s so it's a very acceptable high quality format; DSLR and GoPro exclusive stuff gets ProRes Standard. I've also done offline/online between FCP7 and Apple Color or Resolve, the former kind of dying out due to lack of support for new cameras so Resolve is the modern choice. FCP7 only handles select native formats (IIRC mostly flavors of XDCAM and AVCHD) so I don't try to uprez directly in it."
editors,33fxi7,Kichigai,2,Wed Apr 22 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"Transcoding. If it ain't ProRes then you really should be transcoding it. If you're doing multi-cams then pay attention to what you're transcoding to, as FCP7 requires all clips in the sequence to be of identical specifications (including codec)."
editors,33fxi7,schmattakid,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:00:38 2015 UTC,"This.    Here's a few more:  If you want a stable system-- transcode everything into the same flavor of prores and make sure your sequences are running native.    Never put a psd or anything bigger than about 1920x1080 in a timeline.  Make pngs with transparencies.  When the cut is locked do finishing on something else.  H264-- hell no!  Transcode that.  AAC or mp3 ?  Transcode that to a if for WAV.  Probably best to avoid nests.  Organize your project with exactly the same folders as your hard drive.  Export 'same as source files' from the timeline and then transcode to h264 with something that renders fast.  Never ever put a QuickTime reference file into final cut.  Ever.  You'll think it's a great Idea, and then it'll fuck your project forever.  Set your autosave to 5 mins."

You should just use Premiere Pro then and export an XML for FCP at the end.  It will save you much hassle.   But if you want to know, automatic duck will still work, so long as you avoid any newer codecs.  It will add a lot of time to your work, and you will have to double check everything.  The most common issue is that FCP sometimes messes up drop-frame versus non-dropframe timecode formats ... if that happens, your clips will not relink in Avid.  Not a chance.  Lots of pain, experienced it first hand.   I do not envy you, good luck."
editors,33d1zt,agent42b,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:34:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up. I feel like I don't know enough to be asking the right questions, you know?  From what I understand, they'll be ingesting footage themselves, pulling any needed archival footage, and then sending us their project along with relevant media. We would then do THE MAGIC TRANSFER THING and start assembling a sequence. I don't believe we'll be adding graphics or any color correction. Then we do THE MAGIC TRANSFER THING again and they somehow get a sequence with footage for them to color/online/finish."
editors,33d1zt,agent42b,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:52:16 2015 UTC,"The moment they ""hand you a project"" is when your troubles begin.  Lots of potential issues here: what if they group clips, sync separate audio -- all of that work is not transferable (easily) with automatic duck.  Same with edit markers or logging notes: doesn't transfer.  They may even use apple-specific codecs such as their own XDCAM variant ... that alone will be the bane of your existence.    Automatic duck is usually used to convert completed, single sequences from FCP7 into Avid.  Even then, an assistant has to comb the edit and fix all kinds of stuff.  What you're talking about is inhering an entire project, which will come with many more issues.   If you absolutely cannot work in FCP7 or Premiere Pro (you really should... hint hint) you may want to ask them to give you raw media and forego ""making a project"" -- at least this way you can build a project yourself.    The other thing ... these 'converted projects' always crash more.  way more."

Just, if you guys are offlining it, once you've pic-locked are you sending off (or back) for finishing post, or are you doing that yourselves? Obviously to go off to Pro Tools or Resolve or whatever is easy enough from any of them, and doesn't require translating back to FCPX, in which case you could do all the regular end-of-edits and leave it at that.  Are they just going to be taking your avid/premiere to FCPX that you've sacrificed your first-born for, and sticking it on a shelf, never to be used again, only to then work from the final master?"

My first was essentially a jr editor job, backing up, ingesting and cutting together basic sequences with a PD for studio. Not very technical, £21k. My second is much more technical, and what an editor is more of edit manager. Looking after the RAID setup, knowing the back end of that, fixing computers, swapping out graphics cards, along with the ingest/transcode/consolidate. Doing Adobe After Effects graphic sequences as well as jumping between AVID/FCP/Prem concurrently. £26k.

You then cut the piece with the merged clip.  This has the advantage of allowing easy replacement/relinking and your mixer only has to deliver an audio file, not a full video file.

The shots I’d used in the assemblies and cuts all switched. Like magic, the replacement flowed through every use in my Final Cut library, meaning no work I’d done had been wasted.

editors,33ba8h,kkashyyyk,7,Tue Apr 21 02:58:09 2015 UTC,"The issue is actually pretty complex, it becomes really stupid at times.    At the heart:  H264 really only holds broadcast levels (16 black, 235 white). However, it has a metadata flag that is supposed to extrapolate those levels out to 0 black and 255 white - which is what will look proper on a computer monitor.  The second issue is the media player: DOES it actually read the H264 metadata flag, properly displaying levels of 0-255?  If quicktime player (QT7 or QTX, doesn't matter) is your player of choice, the answer is rather complicated.  It seems to read the flag at 720p or lower.  1080p h264 video is a hit and miss depending on which encoder you used.    What I do:  I encode quicktime H264 in Avid, always using the RGB option (this is the metadata flag to extrapolate ... don't worry about Avid's poor naming) and encode at 1280x720 or less, ensuring that the client will see proper colors (quicktime player's fault!).  Of course, this also means that you must color correct your video at broadcast 16-235 levels ... if you do not, then you've screwed yourself.    I don't work in Premere too much, but so long as I keep my levels within 16-235, I've found that sending your cuts off to Adobe Media Encoder always results in proper levels on the H264 too.   The good news is that Youtube or Vimeo seem to also read those flags at any resolution too.  The dumb news is that youtube ALWAYS expects the RGB flag to be on.  If you upload an H264 to youtube without the RGB flag (again, Avid is the only software which allows you to do this) it will turn out wrong ... so... that's dumb, but remember always use the RGB flag.   Another alternative is to use Sorenson Squeeze -- it's x264 encoder has some very specific levels conversion options for even further tuning."

The warranty on most 2.5"" drives is 1-2 years (versus 3 for the larger 3.5"" drives). That little sucker is on borrowed time already, and being a boot drive it'll have seen more than its fair share of spin ups/spin downs, seeks, parks, and thrashes. Just set it aside and be done with it.  The LaCie drive is OK, but we've had pretty good luck with the OWC Elite Pro Mini. For 1TB in its most expensive configuration it's still cheaper than the LaCie drive, but it has a 7,200 RPM disk in there, which even over USB 3 should make it faster than the LaCie drive.  If you're not traveling around I'd strongly suggest moving up to a 3.5"" drive system, though. They tend to be able to take greater punishment, and get more bang for your buck. The full-sized OWC Mercury Elite Pro runs close to what the 2.5"" version runs, but you will definitely notice a performance difference, and a longevity difference.  Smarter buy would be a Guardian MAXimus in RAID1/Mirror mode (looks identical to the OWC Elite Pro Duals to me). Write performance won't be sped up, but read performance will, and you'll have full redundancy in the event of disk failure. You could even bump it up to dual 2TB drives and still be about the same price as two 1TB externals, but with less cable clutter and more hardware support."

When I directed a student film, my editor put one dissolve into it and I quite liked it.  After Optimus Prime and Megatron start (b)romantically holding hands, Whitney Houston's ""I will always love you comes up"" and the diagetic sound goes away.  In the last shot with the music, the waitress is looking at a can of robot poison, and then there is a dissolve back to the robots ready for dessert.  It covers the time jump of them eating their meal, but is was also the transition from a romantic moment to the waitress being ready to commit robot murder, and gets out of the music montage.  You can make fun of my writing and directing all you want, but I feel like the dissolve my editor used was solid.  It glues together major changes of state.  Time is a big factor in that, but often not the only one.  For example, in the Spaceballs clip which has already been posted twice to this thread, the dissolve covers the literal jump in time to the day, but it also covers the change in stakes for the characters of it now being dangerously hot.  For good measure:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVFDAhPHDa4"

It's a great way to evoke dread -- it's like no scene really ends, and a vague uneasiness melts over the whole piece.   Of course anything that's overused is bad. Otherwise, if it works, go for it. I don't believe there should be any rules about this kind of thing (and rules have a kind of meme-like quality to them anyway; they can be trendy).   Also while it's not fiction, another practical application is in sports editing. Highlights, in particular. Seriously -- go try it. A hard cut from one slo-mo to another is disorienting and inappropriate. Bizarre but true."
editors,338oz0,farmerpipe510,6,Mon Apr 20 16:12:39 2015 UTC,I completely agree with its use in horror. Its intended to be unsettling and confusing. A film that does this extremely well IMO is The Shining.

Especially when there were multiple in a row, connecting long shots of the houses or other environmental shots. I don't know, there was something off in them for me.   One scene in particular I found annoying was when she drove away to the summer house late in the film, and there was a series of closeup dissolves of her driving to symbolize that she drove for a long time. I found that to be super unnecessary and too explicit in it's editing. To me, they could have kept one long take of her reacting emotionally and then tell the time difference in another, less obvious visual way (time of day change, weather change, acting, etc.)  Again, this is highly subjective, but I kept getting pulled out of that film because of the editing, and it annoyed me."

And I like it, although that may be nostalgia. Before the 1990s the dissolve was used very often and usually signified the passage of a longer period of time. I agree that unless used very deliberately dissolves mostly look terrible but they do have their merit.  There are some interesting views here: http://masteringfilm.com/when-to-use-the-dissolve/ but to be honest I feel that the dissolve has outlived itself as a 'normal' part of film language.  In the old films (from the 50s, 60s and 70s) the dissolve was sometimes used to mask reel changes during projection."
editors,338oz0,Iggapoo,6,Mon Apr 20 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"The wipes and dissolves of Star Wars are a bit of an outlier. It's in direct homage to Flash Gordon, and the star wars franchise is just so gigantic in our culture many of these little details get a free pass.  The use of transitions is like selecting a font in design. Each transition can be ascribed an emotional context for communication, and when used well can inform an audience on temporal changes in addition to spatial.  I'm wary of saying any type of edit cut is never allowed, I've even seen the star wipe employed with success (although it's play was as a bit of referential humor to editing).  In the big fat pork belly of editing you don't really see wipes at all, unless it's for very specific effect.  The dissolve is different though. You still see it used to demonstrate passage of time, or in commercial editing to indicate an edit point to adjust how an interview subject is speaking.  But mostly, don't look at whether something is ""in favor"" or not. Instead choose the edit that makes the most sense for the context of the work.  Then again, hard cuts still do about 99% of the heavy lifting."

His photography is wonderful, the lighting of his videos are great, but his final videos are always amateurish. I usually describe it to people as something a high school student in an Intro to Production class would create. I've attempted to talk to him about this and to get him to change by trying to convince him to let me do the job I'm hired to do - edit. He insists on using cross dissolves ALL THE TIME. If it doesn't dissolve, he called it a jump cut even if it cuts to something completely different. Also, EVERY SHOT has a Ken Burns effect. He doesn't understand the purpose of b-roll. He only shoots one or two different b-roll shots, but 5-6 takes per shot. I end up with 4 minutes of a person looking at their notebook and 4 minutes of a person smiling into the camera. Sometimes he'll get establishing shots of a building or something, but the most recent project is all interviews, we don't need building establishing shots, and when I try to use them as b-roll he says it doesn't make sense, so I have to remove it and fade between all the edits I was trying to cover. He pays well, thought. It takes his assistant 2 days to cut a 1:30 (one minute, not one hour) interview, so he budgets per project, two days for editing. It takes me about 2-3 hours from start to finish, including adding in all the cross fades, Ken Burns, color, and sound. I've made over $1000 in less than one day's worth of work.

Being an AE is a career unto itself. Also, you've got to consider health insurance, retirement, self employment taxes, etc."
