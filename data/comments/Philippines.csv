They've taken their freedom, safety, and liberty for granted.  They don't know the terror of being dragged from their homes for alleged ""state crimes."" The feeling of being unable to express their opinions without surveillance breathing down their necks.   Ngayon ang lalakas na ng loob nila magsi-post sa facebook about their rants to PNoy, i-try nila yan sa panahon ni Makoy, kahit madami pa kayo iisa-isahin kayong dadamputin.   Also, all these Pro-Makoy people are working under the illusion na lahat ng statistics na nagsasabing pangit ang standards of living during the martial law, crafted daw by Pro-Aquino writers and historians, na nabayaran to dismantle Marcos' reputation and ""all that he's done for the country"" even though international literature are all in line with our local literature (ano yun may grand conspiracy spanning the entire world? Binayaran nila Aquino lahat yan? Lahat ng international statistics ng UN? IMF? WB? Wake up people!)   It was during the Marcos Regime na tumaas ung National Debt natin, bumaba yung minimum wage, nag inflate yung peso, tumaas yung peso-dollar conversion, at tumaas yung national poverty levels. Pero yung mga naaalala lang ng mga kabataan na nagrerepost nung mga kababuyan nila about FM as some 'disgraced President' eh yung mga buildings and monuments na pinagawa nila Imelda (also ironically forgetting an incident where they tried to rush one and it collapsed killing many) kasi naturally nga naman, those monuments withstood the test of time.   Napaka short-sighted ng mga younger generations ngayon eh. Biglang magsasabi na ""buti pa sa panahon ni Marcos..."", half the time mali yung isshare na information but all the time disrespecting all the people unjustly detained and killed by the dictatorship.   Ang pangit pa dito eh napakabilis magiba ng isip ng mga Pilipino! Tignan niyo, nasa posisyon na ulit ng kapangyarihan si Imelda Marcos at si Bongbong Marcos!

Philippines,3dzx3e,deadlockispumped,5,Mon Jul 20 23:59:29 2015 UTC,Impulse buy for me. I thought I could escape that urge to buy the phone. I've gon through intense measure to not see the words Alcatel Flash Plus then suddenly this comment. :'(  EDIT I just bought it. I must learn how to control myself.
Philippines,3dzx3e,fvig2001,2,Tue Jul 21 00:17:56 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I also impulse bought it since the spare phone I was using was terrible and I got tired of watching 240p videos on it."
Philippines,3dzx3e,deadlockispumped,2,Tue Jul 21 00:20:33 2015 UTC,"Oh. I'm a fan of Alcatel since way back when I was a kid and we had that big black cellphone when cellphones was just starting to become a thing in the PH. My current phone is an Alcatel One Touch Glory 2. Outdated, yes. But it does suit my needs for music playing and durability. This phone feel from 4th floor and it did not shatter. I'm just hoping that the Flash Plus would have the same durability that I'm looking for."

Philippines,3e1cyj,fullofsheet,0,Tue Jul 21 09:34:30 2015 UTC,The mechanics of weight loss and weight gain are just the inverse of each other. A short answer is you calculate your TDEE and eat 500 calories in additon to your TDEE number and youll gain 1lb a week

Philippines,3e0m6i,FinalSynFrey,4,Tue Jul 21 01:13:21 2015 UTC,"PLDT/Smart/Sun guys are well-trained. I've met some of them during trainings, conferences and other events, and they seem to be rather capable guys. But that might not be what you're asking about. The customer-facing guys these companies send out are contractors, so the quality of these guys might turn out to be subpar, as these are the lowest bidders, after all. Let's just hope that these ISPs are, in fact, strict in enforcing their service level agreements with these contractors, unlike how the NTC is lenient towards these ISPs."
Philippines,3e0m6i,L30ne,2,Tue Jul 21 07:19:23 2015 UTC,"This pretty much sums it up. There are some extremely smart guys and girls behind the scenes and in the data centers.   The problem is that there's not enough of them, so their time is considered to be very precious. As such the frontline CS/technicians will only pass the issue up the chain if there's really no other choice.  The other problem is that the technicians or engineers they send to you often know it's a problem on their side of things but are not allowed to tell you that. They have to go through the same bs motion of testing and acting like they don't know what the problem is. It's just a way to placate the customer until they give up complaining or until the problem with their network actually gets fixed. So they sometimes seem kind of dumb or unhelpful but really it's just that their hands are tied.  I had some issue with the CGNAT of Bayantel and after so many months of frustration, I started asking around for anyone who had a contact inside Bayantel. I managed to get hold of someone important in their network management department and he fixed my problem in just minutes and we had a good chat. He was extremely knowledgable.   If you've seen the wiring point for telephone/DSL connections where you live, you start to get an idea why connections randomly go down so often. It's generally a free-for-all where 'technicians' can easily disturb other peoples wires by accident. Leaks in those areas seem pretty common too, so when the rain comes, peoples phone lines and internet start messing up.   Btw OP, my friend in the UK recently lost his internet for two weeks after some contractors dug down into some Fiber cables. It affected a huge area."

I told them we don't have electricity so we won't be able to check if the problem's been fixed. but they went ahead and inspected our connection. turns out an idiot tried to steal  bayan tel's wires(cables?) right before the storm hit. they fixed it then and there and assured us that once the electricity is up, we can use our internet right away.     tl;dr Bayan tel is willing to send their guys even during a storm"

When we moved here, we had about 21 crates of household furniture and things and they unloaded it all in 2 days. Usually movers can be careless with your things. I asked them if we could move the sofa  a few inches to the left, and he called his buddies to stop what they were doing and actually pick up the sofa to move it like  5 inches over.  I've moved over 10x all over the world and they were the best out of all the movers we had. Highly recommended. Though they can be pricey.

Ordered a box of donuts and went ahead spend the rest of the day working there, the next day I was given free donuts (other than the box I ordered) and coffee and the crews became empathic with my situation. After that, I became a KK regular in Gateway for about 2 years, since they're very accommodating.  Sometimes they'd even asked for my orders from the table and just hand them money, of course I still get free donuts from time to time too.

We had already ordered, so we canceled. They didn't offer us any solution and just said the stock ""pasensya na"" as if that's supposed to resolve anything and allow you to half-ass your way through life /tangent. Anyway, afterwards their manager texted and said they were sorry and they would deliver the food that we ordered for free, and they did, to Paranaque.

Also yung Technical support ng Sky Broadband mas ok ang service pag via Email at FB ang trouble reporting.   Compare to PLDT na pipila ka pa sa Center nila to request for installation then after a few days may dadating na taga LBC para i deliver/collect ang application form at installation fee then a few weeks na waiting na naman  for the actual install.

Getting an internet connection through an agent is often the fastest way because they want to get their commission ASAP so they push through your application.  The problem is that some agents mislead or straight out lie about what you're going to get, so read everything carefully before you sign anything and compare it with the official offerings of the ISP."

As I've said in the past, I'd favor making all buses in Manila publicly run (and relegating private bus companies to the provinces).  With buses in the metro under public regulation, bus drivers would actually follow the system.  that would lead to less traffic because bus drivers wouldn't be bloody racing each other up and down EDSA.

I consider mo ang lahat ng sinabi ko sa naunang mga item sa listahang ito. Sige tanggalin mo sila. Pero saan mo sila ilalagay? Saan sila sasakay? Magresign na lang ba sila lahat sa mga trabaho nila? O umalis sila lahat ng alas tres ng madaling araw sa bahay?   Ang punto. Hindi ganun kasimple ang problemang ito, at hindi pwedeng sabihin lang natin na alisin sila dian kasi hindi sakayan yan."
Philippines,3dw9pu,RiceLeaf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:28:40 2015 UTC,"The govt definitely needs to improve mass transpo. That aside, isn't the fix simple tho? Commuters must take into account the extra 30mins to properly use use the terminal, where buses are available and there's space to accommodate queues. It adds to commute time? That's life until mass transit improves. Sure, it's more convenient to just hail buses anywhere, but it lacks discipline, is chaotic and causes additional problems. It's like those jaywalkers who jump island fences and risk life and limb crossing major thoroughfares because the pedestrian overpass is 100 meters away."
Philippines,3dw9pu,razzy2014,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:09:30 2015 UTC,"That reminded me of a past experience where our driver took a shorcut off the highway because of the traffic. Then we found out what the cause of the traffic is.  It's all of those vehicles who, like us, that took off the main road and then coming out the street/corner that lead back to the supposedly traffic-free portion of the main road."
Philippines,3dw9pu,Vega_IRon,2,Tue Jul 21 02:16:49 2015 UTC,"Or the line of vehicles that would counter-flow during heavy traffic, block that lane and butt in at the intersection causing massive jams? Makes me breathe fire."
Philippines,3dw9pu,razzy2014,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:58:06 2015 UTC,"Madaling sabihin pag wala ka sa sitwasyon na yon. I'm not saying that what they are doing is right and should be the norm, what I'm saying is in order to solve the problem, you must understand the reason why they are there, and it's deffinitely not just because all of them are undisciplined. In fact, these people actually hate the fact that they have to do this. If they had a better option, they'd do it. But if the other option is to add 30 mins - 1 hour to your 4 hour daily commute, then I think what they are doing is understandable. 1 oras yun na imbis ipapahinga mo na, nasa labas ka pa. Isang oras na imbis kasama mo pamilya mo, nakapila ka sa terminal o nananakit ang likod sa pagupo sa bus. And if all of them used the terminal, the terminal would get crowded. The 30 mins I was talking about earlier may turn into hours because of long queues. This is an organically developed solution by a crowd of people. I even think this is, right now, actually the best option which benefits the most people. People who have time are at the terminal, people who don't are here. At least nadilute sila at di sobrang concentrated ang dami ng tao. If you can think of another solution that will provide these people with the same or better advantages, they would be all ears and would use it in a heartbeat (like express busses from the terminal to certain business districts in the metro). If all we can say to them is don't do that because it inconviniences me or because it's wrong, then I doubt that would change anything. You can go after the buses, but these guys won't leave. And I doubt you can arrest all of them."
Philippines,3dw9pu,RiceLeaf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:23:48 2015 UTC,"To solve the problem, you must not sacrifice order for convenience. People must conform, not the other way around for the sake of order. If the laws are made to please all people, no law would be passed.   When I use public transpo from Manila/Makati to Diliman, I leave the house 3 hours before my appointed time. If I have a plane to catch, I arrive 5 hours before appointed time. If I have to ride the MRT, I make sure I appropriate enough time. Saying I could spend my time better resting or spending it with my family instead of wasting time lining up, does that entitle me to shit on queues in the MRT and jump the line? Of course not. People line up in the MRT because they have no choice but to line up, they don't have a shortcut to jump onto trains. So they are forced to appropriate travel time to include lining up. I hate diving into a mad crowd scrambling to ride jeeps that stop in the middle of roads... I'd rather walk several blocks and line up conveniently at a jeep stop. If your travel time exceeds what you can accept, they maybe you should look into temporary lodging closer to the workplace, or find work closer to home.   The next problem you brought up is the capacity of the terminal-- I've never been there. Are you saying it's too small?  Btw, if the express shuttles you suggested can help, why not be proactive and petition it with LTFRB?"

A few things to note OP, how was her tone when she said she doesn't kiss random girls? Seryoso ba or Medyo playful? Either way, I'd have gone for ""does that mean I can't kiss you?"" for a response. The key thing here is you have to try to be a little bit playful with your own response. Go with something like ""Know what, I'm wondering what your lips taste like,"" or something to that effect.  Finally, when you finally feel like the moment to kiss has come, either go with ""I'm going to kiss you"" if you're feeling bold. Or... Just lightly touch her face for a bit, trace her jawline or get her hair out of the way/brush it over her ear. If she doesn't recoil to your being touchy you could now go for an imperfect kiss. I.e. one that's not directly aimed at her lips. Could be the corner of her mouth or the upper part of her lips. You'll know she's responding positively when her lips starts seeking yours.  Best of luck. Here's hoping you get to suck each other's faces soon."

When I said it's impossible, they told me it might be a glitch, but I'm the only one. I later learned that there were hundreds of us who experienced the same thing, some of the cases had bills as high as 50k.

It's also worth noting that I never had a problem with my Internet connection since then and Bayantel also started to routinely check for issues in my area.

When I explained that I can't make the new flight and that I'd already paid 15k to select that very specific flight, they told me I'd have to pay again to change it.

We've been calling them 2 days straight to report a problem with our connection, they were apologetic and gave us a report number which we could use to get updates on the problem. come third day, we gave out the reference number but apparently it's a dud. no report was connected to our account (despite the calls we made before) and it appeared that that was the first time we contacted them about the problem. I gave out the names of the people we talked to but they were not familiar with the names. I was furious. I demanded for a manager to explain the fuck up and when I was able to talk to the manager she even admitted that they give out fake names. Normally that wouldn't be a problem but the problem arises in situations like these wherein incompetent agents are not held accountable for when they fuck up."

I complained it's only a few minutes and she explained they've already resold the tickets to stand-by passengers.  So I assume they actually sold them before the cut off period since 3 minutes is pretty tight.  I think I ended up getting around 30% of the fare back as a travel fund by the time they added all their fees. Even though they resold the seats to someone else at a higher price.

The bottom string was barely being detected as being strummed. So I set a negative review so that they'll help me immediately. Then they told me to contact their partners in Asia.   I then contacted them and none of them decided to help due to stupid reasons. The American company then stopped answering for a month. Then I decided to fix the guitar myself. When I opened it, I saw that the case tore through a wire. So I fixed it by soldering a new wire and it's been on storage for months since I lost interest in learning to play the guitar.

As a Multimedia artist, it works fast but after sometime, i missed working on a pc because of endless capabilities. Sure, the MBP and its iOS is smooth but the software available is limited. Being a student, torrenting softwares is the way of acquiring programs, unfortunately, software available for mac is not that abundant. Upgrading is also very expensive. I miss those times wherein adding ram is very simple and cheap. With the MBP, it will definitely burn my wallet. The bottomline is, it is good for a workstation, you can always rely on it. The downside is with the price that you are paying for one, you may already build a PC that is better than the MBP. Windows can also do what the MBP can do plus it is cheaper and it gives you lot of options. Well, it's just my take on the MBP. If you think you need it, go for it. Just take note that there are more options available that won't drain your money."

The batteries are shitty old EGO units that only hold 1000maH and can't fire safely below 1 ohm. The atomizers that you buy from them will continually need to be replaced; at 150/200 apiece and lasting roughly 3 days, you're already spending more on those plus the eliquid/juice than you would on cigarettes.   Save up a little a buy a decent setup. 4k for a Kangertech Subox (which already includes a rebuildable tank) + 900 for two Samsung 25R batteries + 700-900 for a 2-bay charger from xtar/nitecore and you'll likely never have to upgrade from that. Juice/cotton/kanthal wire are all you'll need to replenish on a regular basis, but those are dirt cheap.   Check out /r/electronic_cigarette - there are guides for pretty much everything you need to know, and the community is generally very helpful. Once you've done that and have an idea of what you want, you can go to a store and see if they have everything you need. Planet Vape in Trinoma is good, as is Good Fumes in Cubao. Dark Vaper along Kamuning is ok as well. Vape Joint and The Vape Room in the Ortigas/Greenhills area sell higher-end, more expensive stuff, but last time I checked they also had the Subox in stock."

We probably have one of the lowest per capita incomes in the world so majority of the populace will go for whatever's cheaper.  Locally, I see four types of Gamer. I've listed them below arranged from the most percentage of people to the least:   LOW BUDGET/F2P - The bulk of the local gaming populace. These lot flock to the PC due to the cost of video gaming on the system. Used PCs are pretty damn cheap and internet cafes are everywhere. Also video game piracy is easy with our open internet. For people who prefer purchasing games, Steam Sales are their milk and honey. Also there's a lot of F2P games out now with a ton of replay value (Leauge/DOTA2/etc). MID BUDGET - Owns a console for gaming and might have a PC/Laptop for mixed use. Usually sells old/completed games and often buys used (I do this sometimes when short on food money or for games I'm not that into). Possibly small game library (1-2 games). Family consoles usually fall on this category as well (ex. has a console exclusively for kid-friendly motion games like Just Dance). THE PC ENTHUSIAST - There's a ton of different sub-types. Some splurge on PC parts and skimp on games, stick to piracy or F2P. Some build lean gaming systems and spend their budgets equally between hardware and content. Possibly has a console for some exclusives. THE COLLECTOR - Collects games, gear and merch of a particular console/franchise/whatever or across multiple platforms. This type of gamer buys stuff for keeps. Owns two or more platforms or multiple generations of a single platform. Possible has a display area for toys and merch.   NOTE: This is just my sole observation. These types are more akin to a spectrum than absolute categories. Some might find themselves identifying with two or three of these categories. If you are somehow offended by my post, I apologize. I meant no ill will towards anyone when I came up with this post. Strongly disagree with this post? Please share your points as a reply below.  PCMR Comment: Gaming on a PC built below or on par with a latest console's price will never outmatch an optimized console game's performance. The whole ""Console Peasantry"" bit only applies if you are pitting console gaming to playing on a well built gaming PC (which is usually priced a little over a console). Gaming on a balls-to-the-wall PC will always be far superior to a current-gen console, but may require a second mortgage. There are Pros and Cons to both.  TLDR: First paragraph and PCMR Comment  EDITS: A word, and a wee little grammar tweak here and there. Also added the PCMR Comment thingy and TL/DR."

Philippines,3dxb37,SushiSmusher,9,Mon Jul 20 09:15:49 2015 UTC,There are also squatters in the province although not as much as in MM.   We had squatters in our land. They usually multiply during election season (my tito was a former mayor).  They would threaten us with violence and say that it would affect my titos chances of winning. Then they asked for them to stay in exchange for their votes.  They were kicked out and transferred to the opposition which gladly accepted them because they needed votes.  The opposition still lost and now they have an ongoing court case.  Fuck squatters.

Philippines,3dxb37,levicelery,27,Tue Jul 21 08:33:52 2015 UTC,I always rage when I hear news reports about squatters rioting and demanding compensation when the owner of the private property they are squatting own wants them to leave for whatever reason. It's the owner's property and they can do whatever they want with it as long as it's legal! They have no right to complain.

Philippines,3dxb37,futbolaryo,9,Mon Jul 20 11:09:49 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, the logic of squatters rights is based on the principle of the absentee landlord -- if you own the property but didn't do anything to stop squatters from setting up a home in the first place, what gives you then the right to tear it down without any means of compensation after they've lived there for years?  Also, if I recall correctly there is a law somewhere property owners are required by law to develop the land within a few years. Not sure about the penalties though.   The point is, property rights aren't absolute. Landlords are still obligated to be responsible and liable for their properties. Any mismanagement can lead to forfeiture of some, if not all, rights."
Philippines,3dxb37,dibidi,7,Mon Jul 20 13:22:32 2015 UTC,"That's backwards logic though.  The effective outcome of that is that property owners need to pay someone to kick people out every few months, which really just leads to a waste of resources."

It will only be the same thing if,   You left your car parked somewhere.  you left it clearly and visibly unlocked you left your keys on the dashboard clear and visible for everyone to see you did not pick up your car for a year.    When you own property, there is a clear expectation and responsibility for maintenance and protection. Preventing people from squatting at the onset is a reasonable implementation of that responsibility. You don't have to hire a security guard (it helps), but when someone squats in your land, you're expected to at the very least call the police and report the trespass. If you don't, and you leave them free to trespass for a reasonable amount of time, isn't it also reasonable to assume your consent or your apathy regarding the situation?"

To add a different perspective, Kevin McCloud did a 3-part series on the slums of Mumbai. Here is a slum with whole industries where people have jobs (no matter how crappy), and a semblance of a caring community. I don't, by any means, approve of just letting the slums be.

Though the Lina Law of compensating squatters is unfair, we also have to understand the other side of the coin. Wala namang may nag-aambisyong maging squatter (excluding professional squatters). Their struggle is valid and desperate. This issue isn't black and white where squatters are evil through and through. There are abusive ones, at the same time there are those who willingly relocate, recognizing the property isn't theirs, to be fair about it. Sometimes, they get re-located to areas without access to utilities, transportation, no local jobs-- how can you live like that? Similar to the Binay exposé where he duped families to relocating to Cavite with assurances of modest housing and utilities. Accdg to one of the seniors, they were herded like cattle into trucks, dumped in the new site with absolutely nothing and bare land. It was extremely unsurvivable-- a family died from starvation, young girls would prostitute themselves for little food, etc.. Govt planning is really needed to stop this."

Went to Payatas for a project in college and to be fair, not all squatters are like the lazy, ungrateful bums some people think they are. Some of them are very industrious and engage in small businesses and livelihood programs. It just so happened that they didn't have luck with the birth lottery so they grew up poor and illiterate and didn't have the means to get higher paying jobs or establish stable businesses. They're victims of systemic inequality, ie. when the government decides to concentrate resources and opportunities to select cities at the expense of other areas. I doubt these people are squatters by choice; they are victims of circumstance and they had to squat to survive. It's a given that some of these people break the law. Jail them if you must. However, it would be nice if these things are discussed in a bigger, sociological perspective because quite frankly, reducing the discourse to your apparent disgust for poor people only tells something about your privilege and elitism."

Be/Bi, Ke/Ki, De/Di etc are the same character. The vowels all have their own characters. That's about it.  The script itself is beautiful, imo. It's very curvy.

Philippines,3dwmqt,diyes_lapid,17,Mon Jul 20 03:39:17 2015 UTC,"First of all, I think it's illegal for a company to retain you as a contractual employee for 2 years. By doing that, your employer saves on other costs that are usually given to full time employees. I worked with a start-up before with a max of 50 people, we all got regularized within the six month period. If you feel undervalued and underpaid, leave. If your employer can't even recognize all the hard work you've put out, that only means your company also undervalues its other employees. I think that raises enough alarms to just quit. Of course, find a replacement job first."
Philippines,3dwmqt,cornflakes_,5,Mon Jul 20 04:25:37 2015 UTC,"This, exactly, who said that having 2 year contractual employees is a thing? If your company really is picking up, then it should give some of that money to you in the form of your benefits.  I'm not sure if you have a health package or de minimis or days off but as contractual employees, you also don't have that much job security. I do suggest you move out try to bring some of your colleagues. It's kinda shady to be honest."

Then I asked our company lawyer who is also my yosi friend, off the record, he said that it's common practice in big companies who ventures out on a different business.   And no, we don't have Health Packages, No days off. Fuck."
Philippines,3dwmqt,EnumaAvalon,4,Mon Jul 20 06:01:32 2015 UTC,"I've heard of that practice but that's usually for menial labor. Like the kind of person you can replace in with the snap of a finger.

How does your salary compare with the median industry rate? If it's lower, you should point that out. If it's on par, how much more value (in measurable terms) do you add to the company?  I do think you should be regularized by now. Keep looking for a job even if do you get a raise, and make sure the next one has a clear path to regularization.

Philippines,3dww5i,jpatricks1,2,Mon Jul 20 07:39:46 2015 UTC,"As much as we would all prefer that that was the case, I'm quite certain Luzon is predominantly coal, natural gas, and hydroelectric. Sadly, other than hydroelectric, renewables constitute only a minority of the current generation capability for Luzon. Though on the bright side, renewables are slowly gaining adoption, particularly for embedded generation.

Philippines,3dww5i,jpatricks1,2,Mon Jul 20 10:22:31 2015 UTC,10% as of June 2015. I'm afraid coal- and gas-fired plants seem to be easier to build.
Philippines,3dww5i,L30ne,2,Mon Jul 20 10:25:28 2015 UTC,"i think it's a good idea. i'ld look at solar panel fabrication and installation. there's a growing market for solar panel installations in the PH, so that's pretty good."

Not just solar, but believe the biggest target was biothermal energy.  There's a government report on it which your friend should check out.  IIRC a feed in tariff has been agreed, which should help a bunch of renewable energy projects start moving forward.  I'd suggest your friend try and reach out to people in the local renewables industry, but from what I know it certainly seems like a growth business."

I used to love wresting when I was a kid, my favorites were Yokozuna and the Undertaker. But when my white tito told me it's just scripted it was like the equivalent of finding out Santa Claus isn't real. Since then I stopped watching wrestling. Also, how do the tournaments work if it's just scripted?"
Philippines,3dvjwj,johnbristol,5,Mon Jul 20 02:44:26 2015 UTC,"If your looking at it as a sport, then your looking at it a wrong way. It's probably the highest form of theater in my opinion.

Philippines,3dvjwj,johnbristol,3,Mon Jul 20 03:59:38 2015 UTC,"Well, look at it this way: it's just like any other TV show. Game of Thrones is completely scripted, too, and we don't see people complaining about how the Red Wedding was completely fake. When The Flash takes on a new villain, no one calls the show out for the obvious outcome of the hero beating the bad guy.  And wrestling is actually less scripted than that. The end of matches is predetermined, but they're really working with a rough outline that can change depending on the circumstances of the match. And wrestlers take those bumps for real. They're trained to take them safely, but there's only so much you can do to reduce the impact of getting slammed on the mat.  But really, I just like it for the story. The writing in the WWE is spotty at best, but sometimes the performers are just so good that it doesn't even matter. The reality of their talent transcends all of the fakeness, and within the strange, postmodern context of the squared circle, genuine drama emerges."

Vince (WWE Chairman) himself said that Pro Wrestling and Sports Entertainment are two different worlds. The top wrestlers are being defined on how the audience reacts. It's not just on how they wrestle but with their mic skills as well. Good example is The Rock. He's not that great wrestler compared to Shawn Michaels or Stone Cold but he held so many championship belts and people love him.  P.S: Some people compare UFC to WWE, and it's like comparing Basketball to Golf."

Edit: Didn't go on a blind date with a minor.  Went out with friend of a friend I met for like 10 minutes some time before (so only kind of a blind date) At some point, the conversation went from phones to Clash of Clans to Pokemon. She was curious about why her little cousins liked it so much, so I let her play with my 3DS. (Yes I brought a handheld to a date, that came up later too)  Later she brought up how my character was a girl, asked if there was a reason why. I said that I usually pick female characters because I'd rather stare at a girl's butt than a guy's. Should mention now that Pokemon characters are kids. As expected, digging myself out of that was pretty awkward.  When I got home, my friend texted me asking if next time she should set me up with someone much, much younger. She was joking. I think."

Philippines,3dtodc,nsfw9gag,3,Sun Jul 19 12:37:44 2015 UTC,I'm using TextTeaser for it. It's an automatic summarization library (extracts the most important sentences in an article).

Philippines,3dweoo,barbed,4,Mon Jul 20 02:24:43 2015 UTC,"My cousin bought some stuff for me. He paid thru Credit Card. He is based abroad. Then I had the items delivered thru my Jhonny Air address in NY (when you sign up at JAC's website, they will assign a specific address there under your name). The items arrived here in Manila after a week. Really fast right? But the thing is, JAC charged me Php3000 for a 9lb box. Apparently, they charge depending on volume or weight - whichever is higher. Amazon used a big box for my orders. So yeah, pretty sucks.  Maybe it will be best if you have it shipped directly to the Philippines but it will take more than a month. Cheaper, but longer wait."
Philippines,3dweoo,wehwhatever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:00:05 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, Amazon delivers by itself or I need a 3rd party?"

Philippines,3dweoo,wehwhatever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:48:46 2015 UTC,They have International delivery option. =)
Philippines,3dweoo,sharkatemyhomework,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:00:59 2015 UTC,I've never tried delivery international delivery from amazon but you have to beware of the taxes you have to pay if you decide to deliver straight to your door. My sister bought some cheap clothes from the net (worth I think 3-4k) and had it shipped to her. Upon arriving here she was informed by fedex or dhl that she has to pay for taxes that amounts to 2-3k (ouch!). This happened a few years ago and ever since she has been using services like JAC but it is shipped by sea.
Philippines,3dweoo,tbdmike,3,Mon Jul 20 14:09:52 2015 UTC,"I bought stuff - headphones and Jot Pro using a local credit card, had them shipped using Johnny Air. It took a little more than a week to get here. The fees were pretty high but better than having them shipped directly here. I had a bunch of other friends order stuff too so I had to pay around 400 pesos since we split the fees.  Customs is a bitch if you have it shipped directly. They'll milk about 40% of the worth of your items. JohnnyAir lets you retrieve your stuff directly from their outlets so you're safe.  I also bought a pair of cheap knockoff headphones from dx.com as well as some random accessories - it took 1 month to get here but free shipping. Customs didn't bother with that one."
Philippines,3dweoo,teleclem,2,Mon Jul 20 06:58:28 2015 UTC,"Amazon has Amazon Global now and they deal with customs directly and only pay what is right (no high corrupt prices). You prepay this with your order and if they get it cheaper when it does go through customs here, they'll refund you the difference. If they get charged higher, they'll eat the costs.   They ship this via DHL too so it gets here very fast. I ordered a big item on a Saturday and it was with me Tuesday, no hassle."
Philippines,3dweoo,tbdmike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:48:32 2015 UTC,"I want to buy a Sony Smartwatch, it looks cheaper but I think it will get stuck in Customs and fees will make it more expensive.  e: also some filters."
Philippines,3dweoo,gruffalo77,2,Mon Jul 20 07:09:18 2015 UTC,Yeah small electronics are good bought from Amazon. You'll be paying JAC I think 2-3k worth of fees for something that small. Includes pre-declared customs fees so you only pay what the standard fees they charge you at the outlet.
Philippines,3dweoo,wehwhatever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:22:18 2015 UTC,"So it seems 3rd party is better, less hassle."
Philippines,3dweoo,gruffalo77,2,Mon Jul 20 07:24:27 2015 UTC,"I tried 2 forwarding services - pobox.ph and forexworld.com both will consolidate your items and are by ship, so it takes some 4-6 weeks, but cost is cheap and only depends on size not weight. so far got all my stuff."

Philippines,3dweoo,teleclem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:28:32 2015 UTC,How much did you pay?
Philippines,3dweoo,xblux,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:46:13 2015 UTC,We usually wait until we fills big box which is some 70 usd. That fits a lot of stuff since they help you to repackage everything. I think smallest starts at 30
Philippines,3dweoo,_socinus,2,Mon Jul 20 12:34:56 2015 UTC,30 to 40 days more than that get worried. Its a risk using regular mail.  I no longer use regular mail cause someone in the seaport steals items. I had experienced it twice.  Small items like blu rays and books in low volumes don't get taxed.

Tl;dr they purposely overprice it since they only get peanuts from insurance companies and they need the extra dough to compensate for those who get admitted but have no money to pay immediately/at all.     In this country we have public hospitals (subsidized by the state so cheaper than private hospitals), philhealth (public health insurance), and even private hospitals have charity wards. It's way cheaper than in the states especially if you have the patience to line up  and do the paper work required to qualify for discounts. Edit: spelling"

If your parents will sponsor your trip, best you mention that. Just make sure you establish that you have every reason to go back. Maybe mention plans for graduate studies, an impending employment opportunity or the likes. Bring land title documents or family business certificates if you have one. Make your itinerary specific, jot down names of family members you will be visiting (they will check that out in their database). Good luck!"

My reason for going? To watch Wicked and explore Sydney. I crashed at a long lost aunt's place, and stayed in a hostel for a couple nights.

Of course mention that your parents will be paying for the ticket and pocket money. If you can provide  a letter of invitation from your host family or even just a copy of email exchanges or something that can prove that you are communicating with you family in the US for this vacation, the better. (just for backup)   You still do need to bring you parents' documents (even just bank statements or land titles or other assets) again, for backup, just to prove that up to this point, you are still financially dependent on your parents- all the more reason to return. Don't show unless asked by the consul.  There's nothing wrong in bringing too much documents. You'll never know what they will need. In my case, they just asked for an invitation. :)"

Source: Has endured so much heat walking back and forth around the University for classes.  Edit: Yes, our malls are very cool, especially SM malls. That's why this type of business thrives so much in the Philippines. Also, I think a conservative estimate about the electric bill for a 24/7 aircon would be about anything more than P10k(>$250).  Although for you, I think you'll acclimatize to the weather like all Filipinos do given time. The human body is greatly adaptable."

I went out to find somewhere to eat for lunch at midday on foot and I regret that decision wholly.   I run air conditioning on a timer so that it turns off during the night and activates again round the time I wake up. But I make sure to turn it off when I'm not in the room."
Philippines,3du1ys,Raspberry_Pancake,2,Sun Jul 19 14:23:22 2015 UTC,Hmm you'll run into humidity much more than the heat. Heat can be unbearable during the dry season. But yeah.

All major malls are cooled, but it's probably colder if you use the AC unit at your house. Quick tip on SM Megamall, it's REALLY crowded on Fridays-Sundays, I think you should expect the same on all malls. Traffic's super bad too.  Also, if you're a button-down shirt type of guy, expect to wear a lot of t-shirts. I could only wear button-downs when I'm at school/any other air-conditioned place.  As for your electric bill, I'm not really sure. It should be around ~4-5k pesos above though (considering all the lights/heaters/TV + 24/7 AC you'd be using)."

Buy a handkerchief to wipe the sweat off of you and cake yourself with baby powder (available in multiple scents) half way through the day. Really, it makes life much more comfortable.

Philippines,3drvsw,failzapper,9,Sat Jul 18 23:14:51 2015 UTC,Nothing that I've heard of but that traveling comment was towards the ref telling him about it which is normal. He never said that traveling shit talking to our face. He puts it on ig pretending he did say it to our face.  And if your up by 20-30 the whole game you have the right to be a little flashy during the end of the game which we were doing.
Philippines,3drvsw,failzapper,4,Sat Jul 18 23:17:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the clarification. For a moment, the placeholder 'Douchebag 1' convinced me that it was one of you guys; plus it's vague enough that I didn't expect it to be one of the refs, and I'm sorry for that. But besides twister claiming he's ""a funny motherfucker,"" which automatically makes him unfunny, he said you guys were making fun of their team by ""screaming for tap boards [and] doing behind the back layups."" Did any of that happen?  Edit: words"
Philippines,3drvsw,red_storm_risen,3,Sat Jul 18 23:26:28 2015 UTC,I have no idea what tap boarding is but the behind the back lay ups was just at the end of the game when they had no chance of catching up
Philippines,3drvsw,pickup_bball_lv,7,Sat Jul 18 23:38:36 2015 UTC,Tap boarding is when a player taps the backboard as he lays the ball in.  Consuelo de bobo for pinoys who can't grow past 6' and jump high enough to dunk.  Of course Mo would know this. He can't jump high even if he was projectile launched off of an intestinal tract powered by beans and taco bell.
Philippines,3drvsw,carl2k1,7,Sun Jul 19 02:19:36 2015 UTC,Oh no we never did that. My teammate tried to dunk the ball on a lob but that's it
Philippines,3drvsw,seemedlegitatfirst,4,Sun Jul 19 04:11:41 2015 UTC,"Throwaway acct here. I was playing in another game, and am FilAm so I don't know who Mo is and didn't know that he was a celebrity in the PI. I watched that last game bc I was waiting for my friend to finish (he was playing on Mo's team).  From what I saw, the other team was definitely beating Mo's team by like double digits most of the time. What was fucked up though was the other team started talking shit to Mo in the second half and basically trying to alley-oop, and was tapping the backboard after each attempted layup in a 6"" under copper league (meaning least competitive). The shit talking started after Mo told them to stop doing that, bc that's disrespectful. The other team started talking shit to Mo, and to make it worse, the girls that were sitting on the sideline for the other team started cheering for Mo's team whenever they made a basket, to be sarcastic and make fun.  That little dude Mo looks like he doesn't take shit from anyone and started talking shit to the other team. LOL the other guys on his team looked so winded they didn't care and just wanted to finish the game. I don't even think they knew what was going on.  I asked my friend and they said they wanted to run so it's something healthy to do instead of getting drunk on a Friday night, and these youngins started talking smack to guys 30 and over. The whole team actually didn't care, but Mo don't take shit. I guess that's his M-O in the PI."
Philippines,3drvsw,penis_reference,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:23 2015 UTC,Sorry man I know this is late and I just saw this. I want to clarify that we don't tap the board after every lay up attempt. We never do cause we know it's stupid. The alley oop I threw was on a fast break with literally no one guarding us so I decided to have fun with my teammate who's been working on dunking. He missed but it was cool to see him get up. And as for the trash talking we didn't start. We just called some travels the ref didn't see and they started to get angry. But if you saw different then that's cool to hear from an unbiased perspective and thanks for the input.

Bugbog ni Quigg yung Castilla na si Martinez, pero tingin ko pa rin magandang chance ni Nonito talunin si Quigg. Si Frampton, Northern Irish, lumaban kanina. Tumba dalawang beces sa unang round pero nanalo padin. Natamaan lang ng kalaban ng left hook, kayang I-time ng suntok. Kaya din ni Nonito yan I feel like."

His delivery is commendable but probably given better material he could go a long way.  The comments on telling it's a joke for smart people is kinda stupid to me because the punchline is there. There is no subtle references that you look for which happens to exist in a intelligent joke. Heck if you tell these people a real intelligent joke the responses could either be ""Di' ko gets"" or ""Ay nosebleed"".  Also Pepe Smith called......He wants his catchphrase back."

Of course this is only based on my speculation."
Philippines,3dryu7,JakePops,2,Sun Jul 19 06:52:32 2015 UTC,I feel like it's because of how dry the delivery is.

Beijing has been pushing for bilateral talks instead of multilateral talks, in large part because it frankly would have the upper hand in those negotiations.  Bilateral negotiations would also frankly require multiple negotiations, with several countries, given the Spratly case.  As such, agreements made in bilateral talks may or may not be viable, as other countries not involved in the talks may raise issues.  Frankly, no reason to favor bilateral over multilateral talks from the PH point of view.  So basically if Binay were elected, we'd be back to being China's bitch."

Philippines,3dspds,annadpk,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:23:25 2015 UTC,"The question is how much is Beijing willing to pay the Philippines.  If Beijing is willing to help Philippines to defeat both NPA and MILF, just like they helped the Sri Lanka, maybe its a good decision.  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/how-beijing-won-sri-lankas-civil-war-1980492.html  How much will it cost? Sri Lanka was spending 3.5% of their GDP on military when they defeated the Tigers.  Philippines is only spending 1.2% at the moment.  If Philippines says ""I will be your bitch if you give us 50 Billion of equipment and training"", it might be worth considering.  Peace in Mindanao or sovereignty in the South China Sea?   Unfortunately, the Chinese are too conservative, they wouldn't take a risk like that."
Philippines,3dspds,grittycotton,4,Sun Jul 19 04:10:16 2015 UTC,"If Beijing is willing to help Philippines to defeat both NPA and MILF   PH doesn't need China's help to deal with insurgents. What's needed is the political will and direction.   The MILF has been beaten before, only to rear its ugly head back due to the complacency of the succeeding administrations.  As a result, the Armed Forces of the Philippines launched a successful campaign against these rebel groups and 43 minor camps, 13 major camps including the MILF headquarters, and Camp Abubakar fell. MILF suffered heavy losses and the head of MILF, Sheikh Salamat Hashim, fled the country and sought refuge in Malaysia.  As for the NPA, i don't know about the recent numbers, but here's what i got.  In March, 2008, AFP chief Hermogenes Esperon Jr., claimed that the New People's Army (NPA) rebels had only around 4,900 members, significantly down from 26,000 at its peak in 1980's."
Philippines,3dspds,annadpk,0,Sun Jul 19 08:41:37 2015 UTC,"It might seem like a victory, but its not.  All the Philippines army had done was dispersed the problem.  The MILF just retreated into the countryside to pursue guerrilla warfare.  Like the movie star that he is Estrada was putting on a show.  AFP just doesn't have enough soldiers to secure Mindanao. Marcos allocated 75% of the Army, and he still couldn't tackle them.  When Sri Lanka defeated the Tamil Tigers it's military spending as a % of GDP was 3.7%, it had 150,000 soldiers in the army (not including the air force and navy) in a country of 23 Million. Philippines only spends 1.2% of GDP and has a army of 80,000 Men.  To achieve a decisive victory would require increase in taxes or divert massive amounts of spending from the existing budget in defense or to get a external partner to bankroll you."
Philippines,3dspds,grittycotton,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:18:25 2015 UTC,"First of all, i'm not a fan of Erap. I think he's corrupt and more than deserves his punishment. I believe he is a highly emotionally driven person, not my choice for a president.  The similarity between Tamil Tigers and MILF is that both were allowed to exists due to complacency of the weak leaderships who don't have the political will and direction. In the case of the Tigers, i'll quote something from your own link:   ""Whenever victory seemed on the cards, heavy pressure from India and the West brought the two sides to the negotiating table.""   The crucial part of China's contribution wasn't the arms, but the chinese veto that stopped the UN from pressuring Sri Lanka to stop finishing off the insurgency.  In the PH, the pressures were from the US, and the local catholic church. Guess what? it took an emotional president to get fed up with decapitations, rape and burnt children to finally ignore those pressures and declare war on those fuckers. Sri Lanka simply didn't have the opportunity to have a leader that got the balls to ignore external pressures, and had to rely on the Chinese to play interference.   I agree that PH defense spending needs to increase. But I also believe that Pinoys have already demonstrated the ability to do the job themselves if they want to."
Philippines,3dspds,annadpk,0,Mon Jul 20 02:03:17 2015 UTC,"Sri Lanka was spending 2.5% of her GDP for 30 years, and another 3.5-4% 10 year prior to the end of the war.  The political elite is scared of giving too much power to the military, because of the fear of coup. Marcos couldn't defeat them, why do you think it can be done today.  You seem to forget the reason why the whole war started  when the Philippine Government started to move Christian Filipinos by the millions into Mindanao.    Like a lot of people, you are assuming there is some white knight to save you, that can resist foreign pressure, when your country doesn't have a history of having an independent foreign policy. The US will only turn a blind eye if the Philippines gives them something.  Then there is China. China would most likely start funding the NPA again, if they see Philippines making headway with MILF  Then there is Malaysia, which offer sanctuary for MILF leaders and units.    The environment in Sri Lanka is very different from that in Mindanao.  Tamils enclaves in Northern Sri Lanka homogenous, meaning there are only Tamils.  In contrast in Mindanao, because of the Christian settlers, even Bangsamoro areas are mixed.   Philippines has a to be willing to accept Christian civilians being killed by friendly fire.  Secondly, the nature of the Tamil Tigers is very difference from the insurgence in Mindanao.  It was centered around one man, Prabhakaran.  Once he was gone the whole dissipated.  In the Philippines you have multiple organizations, with people switching from one organization to another.    The problem is the war is now seen as a religious one, and that is why it attracts foreign terrorist. In contrast the Tamil Tigers were purely a secessionist outfit."

To my surprise, he said, ""You people smell like fresh fish from the ocean!""  Bang, first time taking a bath seemed bad. However, I was later told that there are places/countries where fish is not a staple food.  Specially, those that are land locked; like Nepal and a good number of Indian cities without access to river transportation.

I can personally recommend GrabCar as we use that frequently (plus they have a promo that runs till the end of the month)   Definitely start with GrabCar/Taxi or Uber. If you find a driver you like, you could ask them if they'd be willing to chauffeur for you during your stay."
Philippines,3dss8m,brianbaq,0,Sun Jul 19 03:01:48 2015 UTC,"This. My friend and I use Grabcar because it's more convenient for us since we don't have credit cards. The drivers are all safe and reliable. They also make frequent promos so check out for those. We literally had a ride where we didn't even need to pay and a time where we had a 40-peso bill. Essentially, Grabcar is more expensive than uber, but you need a credit card to use the latter. Grabcar also has the option for drivers to reject you while uebr ensure that the car you pick, picks you up."

Philippines,3dss8m,wehwhatever,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:41:49 2015 UTC,Bill is worth of 40 pesos. Should've worded it better but meh. Put the dashes between 40 and peso to make it an adjective.  EDIT: Punctuations.
Philippines,3dss8m,RawrNeverStops,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:49:31 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this requirement for a credit card. I was in Metro Manila last month (Im US-based) and mostly relied on uber to get around. I just used my visa debit like I do with anything. It's just my normal bank card. A machine can charge it as credit/debit. If I want to charge it as credit, the merchant will require my signature and ID (like with a credit card), if I do debit then they will require a pin. Both methods will debit money from my account.  Enlighten me please."
Philippines,3dss8m,dievraag,2,Sun Jul 19 13:34:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not all to familiar with uber being allowed with a debit card so maybe that's possible, but for the case of my friend and I, we're only 19 and currently students. Our parents do not want us to get involve in credit cards which they believe we may abuse. I do have a Security bank debit card right now, but I am not sure if security bank is a viable partner with uber. Either way, in my current state, it's more convenient to just get grabcar and pay cash rather than trying to maintain your balance for the credit cards.  A quick search shows that the list of debit cards is limited to a handful of brands most if not all aren't local banks. I'm sure my parents won't give me a visa/mastercard anything and I have to get one at my own accord.  TL;DR Cash is more convenient for me. Just wanted to share my own insight on the matter."
Philippines,3dss8m,RawrNeverStops,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:49:01 2015 UTC,"Totes agree with your parents and credit cards. I was just wondering because anything with a Visa or MasterCard logo can be used on a ""credit"" transaction even if its a debit card (where I am). It goes through the same network, but at the end of the transaction it's your checking account being debited. It's not a ""credit card"" with a line of credit, but it goes through the same pipes essentially.  The part that's confusing to me is the fact that not all Philippine bank cards with the Visa/MasterCard logo will work. But I guess that's up to the bank to allow the transaction or not.   Now I feel spoiled with my cashless life."
Philippines,3dss8m,dievraag,2,Sun Jul 19 15:29:44 2015 UTC,I do believe credit card is super useful. I mean only a limited cards in the PH can even be used for Paypal. It's just how it is living in this country. More power to cashless users like you though!
Philippines,3dss8m,RawrNeverStops,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:44:37 2015 UTC,So you can pay in cash in GrabCar? what vehicles do they use?
Philippines,3dss8m,a6000,2,Mon Jul 20 01:29:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, essentially you pick a car through the app. The price is already written on it. Once the cab comes and drops you off, you can pay them with the amount written on the app. In case of promos, if it's a less P100 promo, you have to deduct the value that's written on the app. They don't do it automatically.  For the cars, it can be any kind of regular car that you see on the road. I usually get the really new ones though like vios etc. The plate number's written on the app anyway so you'll know who'll pick you up."

Philippines,3dss8m,a6000,2,Tue Jul 21 01:18:13 2015 UTC,"Getting around Manila / Quezon city is easy, you won't have any issues flagging down a taxi. My recommendation: Open the back door opposite the driver, say the destination. If they nod approval, get in, if they hesitate even for a split second, they're going to want to cut deal so move on to the next taxi. Dime a dozen so don't waste your time on scumbag drivers. I usually don't even bother to shut their door, just look for the next taxi. Don't do deals, use the meter, if you get tongue clicking and whining about traffic don't tip, if you get a pleasant happy driver, it's worthwhile giving an extra twenty."
Philippines,3dss8m,dchky,2,Sun Jul 19 08:03:11 2015 UTC,"I constantly use Uber, and they're really convenient since it has cashless transaction. If you're going to ride for the first time, you can use my promo code: uberomatt. This will give you a P200 credit that you can use.  The downside is that they have this ""surge"" during peak hours and when Uber cars around the location are few.  You can also try GrabCar/Taxi, but I haven't tried those.

Philippines,3dpyvp,Nimphus,0,Sat Jul 18 10:00:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a case of PLDT (or any ISP) having to pay anyone off.   The ISPs can charge as little or as much as they want. International bandwidth is actually expensive, so that accounts for why prices are a little higher. But ultimately, there's just no competition.   If you look through who owns a specific ISP, it nearly always leads back to either Globe or PLDT.  Globe are obsessively focused on implementing data caps on every connection. First with their Prepaid 3G, then to their Postpaid and now the same for their DSL and Fiber customers. When they buy another ISP (e.g. Bayantel), they roll out data caps there too.  PLDT don't do any aggressive traffic shaping and they don't have data caps except on their super cheap bundled plans or 3G/4G. But PLDT don't want to play nicely with other ISPs because they're spending so many millions to improve infrastructure in the PH and don't want to share the benefits with competitors.   The big question is, why aren't anti-competition laws being used to stop these two from Gobbling up every residential internet provider in the Philippines?   The phopenix will help local traffic a bit, but they certainly aren't carrier neutral and should probably change their name to Globe PHOpenIX."

Hardcore netizens are, sure, but you think the average pinoy is going to be aware of this?  Especially when most of us don't have time spent abroad to realize just how much slower our internet is?  People will complain about the slow internet speeds, but most either think it'll cost way too much to upgrade or don't know we're that much slower than our neighbors.  All that, plus, to be honest, it isn't exactly THAT high priority compared to other things like poverty, corruption, etc.  Better internet speeds will help alleviate those issues somewhat, sure, but they're not top priority for most pinoys.

Philippines,3dtzsw,TheIenzo,11,Sun Jul 19 13:22:54 2015 UTC,"I used to be okay with Duterte running, then I heard some of the statements he's made.  I don't know how anyone can support someone who has dismissed the idea of human rights as a western invention not applicable in this country.  Someone who has flat out stated that if elected and not given his way, he would declare a revolutionary government within 6 months.  End of the day, the president has to be at least someone who respects the law.  In a very real sense, upholding the law is one of his primary responsibilities.  When Duterte runs around saying he basically doesn't care that he is violating both the law and people's rights, he is in effect showing that he CLEARLY isn't fit to be president.  If Davao loves him so much they can keep him, IMO."
Philippines,3dtzsw,Vordeo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:33:56 2015 UTC,"He said the peace and order situation in the country presents the same problems and no new solutions are being planned, except for a suspension in the implementation of a law that allows death penalty for heinous crimes.  This, he said, had emboldened criminals.   http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/691527/dutertes-secret-in-keeping-davao-city-phs-safest-kill-criminals  I don't think Duterte disrespects the law. Tiptoes the line maybe. Davao City isn't West Bank.  I support his view since I figure education is the key for rehabilitating criminals to work. When these people view jails as resthouses, someone's not implementing the law properly. I don't think it's as extreme as, ""it doesn't work since it's a western idea,"" but more like, ""Filipinos aren't as well-educated generally compared to developed countries."" For a third-world country like ours, force is the way to teach people not to do bad things, and I agree with that mentality. At least, until we get first-world level. THEN we vote people like Grace Poe into office."
Philippines,3dtzsw,ximca,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:36:36 2015 UTC,"Good point. But when you think about it. If it is society's fault that we fail to educate people then why do we get to get away with it by killing them and freeing ourselves of responsibility cause also reasons like why should we pay for them to get a comfortable life in prison. Also studies shows that criminal behaviors all trace down to social backgrounds and even some studies suggest that genetic factors play a role. Meaning people don't just make themselves criminals by their own. Society creates them and yet you're saying we just dispose them so we can live comfortably from them. Yes we could stop criminal behaviors that way but that still doesn't justify it. I might sound like I think criminals aren't solely accountable for their actions, cause I do. While this might be an unpopular opinion, but I also don't believe in free will (I know most philosophers today will agree on me on this). There is also nothing wrong with prisoners living comfortably in prison. Harsher environments will only make them worse as survival and comfort becomes a rare commodity in prison."
Philippines,3dtzsw,pinoyngauggok,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:48:14 2015 UTC,"There is also nothing wrong with prisoners living comfortably in prison.   There is when they're making shabu labs in prison.  I don't think everything you said is wrong, just that I agree with Duterte that the way the country is now, it wouldn't work. It works for a country like Norway (their jails are fully stocked with TV and airconditioning) because people there understand the law and the consequences of breaking it. Filipino criminals aren't on the same vein, and think of jail as something more comfortable than their own homes. It's easier to get something to eat in jail than searching for food when you're out of it.  You said that criminal behaviors all trace down to social backgrounds, I don't agree. Both rich and poor have the propensity to commit crime, it just happens a lot more with poor people. It's half-anarchy out there, without a fierce leader we won't ever see disciplined people. That's why I think we need someone to not just make laws, but enforce them. What good is a constitution when all it is is a piece of paper, diba?"
Philippines,3dtzsw,ximca,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:38:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think Duterte disrespects the law. Tiptoes the line maybe.    I would disagree.  When a politician says that he doesn't care that he is being investigated for human rights violations, and that he would be happy to overthrow the government, he does not respect the laws of this country.   Davao City isn't West Bank.   It isn't.  Which makes the fact that he is so happy to murder people all the worse.   I don't think it's as extreme as, ""it doesn't work since it's a western idea   From the Inquirer: ""He said the concept of human rights applying to criminals is a Western one which should not have been adopted in the country.""  Are you okay with people (because criminals are people) being executed without due trial?  Because I am not.   At least, until we get first-world level.

Philippines,3dtzsw,Vordeo,2,Mon Jul 20 02:10:33 2015 UTC,"I honestly think you're listening to rumors a bit too much.   When a politician says that he doesn't care that he is being investigated for human rights violations, and that he would be happy to overthrow the government, he does not respect the laws of this country.   To be fair, Human Rights still has not indicted Duterte. They tried in 2010, but dropped the case because of insufficient evidence. Also, if he didn't respect the laws of the country, I don't think the people of Davao would be voting him in time and again. He does enforce things like no smoking, no jaywalking, no trash littered in public, no fireworks, etc.   Which makes the fact that he is so happy to murder people all the worse.   I'd be concerned if my manok was a psychopath. I haven't seen it yet with the bare minimum that I know of him, thank God. Also, I don't think you know what West Bank is (Israeli military occupation for 30+ years).   Are you okay with people (because criminals are people) being executed without due trial? Because I am not.   Do you honestly think courts of justice don't exist in Davao? Because I don't think he'd be able to stay there if he wasn't using it.   The issue is that at some point, we have to move towards first world level.   You're thinking that it's easy to move to first world level. The nearest we've been there is on the 1910's until Marcos' first terms, because of the competence of our presidents and the assistance of the USA up to that point. That issue you're thinking off is so very far off in the future. We haven't even stepped on the entrance to the road of recovery. Do you really think the Philippines is on the way to being first world right now? Mmm, no.   And based off his statements, I sincerely doubt Duterte has the administrative and nation building skills we need to get there.   You should base more on results, as 22 years of governance plus making Davao the city it's now is proof enough that I'd vote for him. Besides, what makes all the others better candidates? And don't tell me you won't vote for any of them for all their faults; that's just petty immature thinking.   Especially when he's happy to peddle federalism as a panacea for all the country's problems despite all evidence to the contrary.   What evidence? BBL? It hasn't even been passed yet.  I truly want federalism. Let the people take care of their own. If that happens, you'll see which places are truly trash and which places aren't. With federalism, the BBL advocates get what they want WITHOUT the cash advance PNoy is so excited to give. Best of all, they can't complain if they fuck it up.  I think you should stop listening to rumors or looking down on the people on Facebook for their uneducated opinions. Sometimes the people get it right. It might be unpopular opinion here, but I do think they got it right with GMA. Mike Arroyo just fucked it all up for her, and she didn't know how to manage her people."
Philippines,3dtzsw,ximca,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:53:20 2015 UTC,"I honestly think you're listening to rumors a bit too much.   Rumors?    I've based my conclusions on legit news stories.  With direct quotes from Duterte.  Try again.   To be fair, Human Rights still has not indicted Duterte.   Are we seriously pretending that Duterte hasn't backed the extrajudicial killings?  Because we're at the point where even Duterte isn't bothered with that.   Also, if he didn't respect the laws of the country, I don't think the people of Davao would be voting him in time and again.   The Marcoses still enjoy wide support in parts of the country, despite all of the murder they committed.  People will pretty much vote for anyone in this country.   I'd be concerned if my manok was a psychopath.   I've never said he was a psychopath.  He is, however, someone who both condones extrajudicial murder and whose statements show that he would be immensely bad for the country.   Also, I don't think you know what West Bank is (Israeli military occupation for 30+ years).   I've got a good friend who is Palestinian-American, who happened to have a degree in Arab history.  I also had classmates from Israel, and from other Arab countries.  I have had firsthand conversations with people who have experienced life in West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  So you are quite wrong.   Do you honestly think courts of justice don't exist in Davao?    Are you seriously denying that extrajudicial killings that were likely carried out with Duterte's consent happened in Davao?   You're thinking that it's easy to move to first world level.   When on Earth did I say anything to that effect?   That issue you're thinking off is so very far off in the future.   So you're saying long term planning is something the Philippines shouldn't be concerned with.  I disagree, and think that attitude is completely self destructive.   You should base more on results, as 22 years of governance plus making Davao the city it's now is proof enough that I'd vote for him.   If that were the case I'd vote for Binay.  When you assign Duterte sole credit for Davao you insult thousands of other people who have worked and sacrificed to improve their city.   What evidence? BBL? It hasn't even been passed yet.   Do you honestly think that Duterte came up with the idea of federalism?  Do you have any, ANY, idea of what the economic implications of what he is proposing are?

I think you should stop listening to rumors    Again, not rumors.  Please stop lying about my statements.   or looking down on the people on Facebook for their uneducated opinions.    If someone spouts an ignorant, uneducated opinion on the internet, it's fair bloody game to point that out.   It might be unpopular opinion here, but I do think they got it right with GMA. Mike Arroyo just fucked it all up for her, and she didn't know how to manage her people.   So it was the wrong decision overall, then.  It's not like Mike Arroyo's being a sack of shit wasn't widely known before the elections.  Which means they got it wrong."

Even the HRW document doesn't have anything that says Duterte supports the DDS.   The Marcoses still enjoy wide support in parts of the country, despite all of the murder they committed. People will pretty much vote for anyone in this country.   Petty criminals vs journalists and freedom fighters. Hmm, I wonder which one earns the ire of ordinary citizens.   So you are quite wrong.   Having a Palestinian-American friend does not mean your opinion of equating the West Bank Palestinian treatment with Duterte's administration is correct lmao.   Are you seriously denying that extrajudicial killings that were likely carried out with Duterte's consent happened in Davao?   Again, proof that Duterte's consent was needed for DDS to move. Ex judicial killings did happen in Davao, no one's denying that. But to say he has a hand in it is libel you know, unless you have evidence.   So you're saying long term planning is something the Philippines shouldn't be concerned with. I disagree, and think that attitude is completely self destructive.   I'm saying you have to think realistically, nowhere did I say something to that extreme. You're obviously an impressionable young person, and I'll have this to say. Your long term thinking of a first-world Philippines will never happen if we don't dispose of our trash first, both literally and figuratively.   If that were the case I'd vote for Binay.   Binay did nothing, it was the Ayala who made Makati the way it is now. I'm not going to address your strawmanning, or else you'll be saying BBM wasn't responsible for the windmills in Ilocos.   Do you honestly think that Duterte came up with the idea of federalism? Do you have any, ANY, idea of what the economic implications of what he is proposing are? Because, to be completely frank, you CLEARLY do not.   I do. I actually understand why Mindanao would want separation from Luzon and Visayas now because of it.  Economic implications?

If federalism happens you're not getting that money anymore, which in my opinion is a better system than what's running right now.   Which means they got it wrong.   I'd support you if the people voted for Mike Arroyo.  This is my final post. You have a lot of ad hominems and strawmen, coming to conclusions based on what the media tells you and not actual research and investigation, and I argued like you back when I was 16.

I'm saying you have to think realistically, nowhere did I say something to that extreme.   You did imply that, actually.  Point is that a long term view is necessary here, and you're all about the short term.   You're obviously an impressionable young person   You're obviously an amazingly biased Davaoeno.  Am I doing this right?   Your long term thinking of a first-world Philippines will never happen if we don't dispose of our trash first, both literally and figuratively.   Way to state the obvious.  Doesn't mean we shouldn't start working towards economic growth though.  See, the economy and public order?  They're entertwined.  Ignoring one to focus on the other tends to lead to both problems not improving.   I'm not going to address your strawmanning,    I suppose that's one way to get away with making ignorant points.   I do. I actually understand why Mindanao would want separation from Luzon and Visayas now because of it.   I'm just going to repeat that you clearly don't understand the federalism issue, actually.  I'd explain, but I think we both know you wouldn't listen.  All I'm going to say is do try and look into the issue, ideally from sources not connected to Duterte.   Economic implications? Lmao do you have any idea how much money Metro Manila has wasted from the provinces? If federalism happens you're not getting that money anymore, which in my opinion is a better system than what's running right now.   That's an extremely simplistic view of the issue.  The effects of enacting a federalist government would be far more complex than simply giving Davao more money.  Again, please educate yourself on the issue.  As to economic implications, are you ignoring the fact that Duterte has stated he would declare a revolutionary government if he didn't get his way in 6 months?  Do you want to ruin an economy?  Because that's how you ruin an economy.   I'd support you if the people voted for Mike Arroyo.   Yes, because people didn't know Mike Arroyo was married to GMA during the election.  Oh, wait...   You have a lot of ad hominems and strawmen   I don't think you know what ad hominems and strawmen actualy are, as you appear to think they mean 'anything that proves my points wrong'.  Meanwhile, you've just flat out lied.   coming to conclusions based on what the media tells you and not actual research and investigation   Your posts have shown zero research and investigation, as shown, most recently, by your immensely ignorant views on federalism.  Oh, and your ignoring everything in the media is hilarious, btw.   The ex judicial killings don't happen a lot anyway.   When your main defense of your candidate is that 'well, he only killed a thousand or so people', you know you've gone over the deep end."

Then he got to the spotlight and then the controversy with the DDS.  And now, he said he won't support Roxas if De Lima is in his slate? That's petty. He's just basking in his fame right now. I'm pretty sure he won't make a good president.

It is not so accurate to say these peoples came from Africa without acknowledging that Asians and Europeans also came from Africa. Austronesians, which is what most Filipinos are, arrived around 4000 BC, most likely from mainland Asia then to Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, parts of Thailand and Vietnam. Around 1000 BC, Austronesians developed seafaring and settled other Pacific Islands and were the ancestors of the Polynesian people, aka Pacific Islanders. Around 500 AD, Austronesians settled Madagascar making them (actually us), the most geographically diverse population. The recent diaspora that geographical diversifies Filipino population, and seafaring sounds very similar to the what their ancestors did in settling the Pacific Islands."

The Pacific islanders came via the Philippines, Indonesia, Papua, and so on. Why would the Philippines not be considered part of Asia?

The results can range from 'not so obvious' to 'completely gone' depending on the type of birthmark. I'd recommend you actually pass by in person and make inquiries directly at a few different clinics before parting with any money. Find a doctor that's willing to tell you about the risks, recovery time, expected outcome, and every detail you might ever want to know about the procedure.  When you say 'removed soon', keep in mind short of cutting them off, it's going to take anywhere from 3 to 30 treatments before you could consider the job done, and you have to wait four to eight weeks between each one."

Philippines,3dq1tu,Ahjon,3,Sat Jul 18 09:40:53 2015 UTC,I'd just like to point out that the people who mostly post anything about how great Marcos was are people who weren't even alive during the time he was in office.
Philippines,3dq1tu,426763,2,Sat Jul 18 10:11:48 2015 UTC,Tell me about it! People talk good stuff and shit stuff never knowing what really happend
Philippines,3dq1tu,Exculpatory,3,Sat Jul 18 10:13:09 2015 UTC,"My driver is educated (CSU) and was alive during Marco's time and while he never uses the word ""great"", he does talk about good things Marcos did (he hates Imelda though). He divides Marcos into idealistic progressive leader and then the crazy murdery later years.  I was alive but not living here duirng that time, though I was here for at least 1 month every year duirng it, and my opinion was very negative. Truth is my driver has some decent points I was unaware of and now my option is kind of mixed. Still think he's a terrible person but he was not all bad (Nixon went to China).  The fact that Marcos built a nuclear power plant that is abandoned and today we are building a fucking coal plant and I pay Meralco no less than 15k per month is pretty damning."
Philippines,3dq1tu,justsayinithowitisyo,2,Sun Jul 19 03:46:26 2015 UTC,"Most people alive during that time were shitting themselves about a communist uprising. Also received a better education and healthcare than their previous generation. and enjoyed a better developed infrastructure. keeping it relative to the times we live in, can we really vouch for a jump in quality of life for our generation vs. our parents? some lucky enough might. But for most of us, the answer would most likely be very gray."
Philippines,3dq1tu,hellotheremiss,4,Sat Jul 18 12:00:31 2015 UTC,"I concede that some dissidents may have suffered during that time, but did rebels and communists seriously believe they would be handled with kids’ gloves by the very government they wished to overthrow and the social order they wanted to overturn? I concede that the media may have been less free and independent or that movement may have been more restricted, but these are freedoms that can be negotiated in view of a higher end.   Nope, the ends does not justify the means. If the means themselves are fuckey, if the method you are using is screwed-up, then your whole enterprise is tainted. Marcos butchered his fellow Filipinos not even in the altar of stability and order, but in the altar of power. Pure and simple as that.   If it were all roses and cakes, then why did so many Filipinos swell the ranks of the New People's Army during that time? Was it just bad air that blew from the Pacific Ocean that corrupted these people's minds?   The sad truth is, there will always be those who will love Marcos. These people usually bring up the whole supposed economic miracles during that time. They tell of the buildings and highways and all the jobs. These are baser forms of individuals whose stomachs feel and think for them. These people, so long as they are fed and housed, they are pacified, they are loyal. That is the level of these people's morality."
Philippines,3dq1tu,alomtegenwoordig,4,Sat Jul 18 23:26:55 2015 UTC,"I wish there was more to that article than just merely saying ""not everyone hates Marcos therefore people were wrong about him betraying and fooling the Filipinos"".  Marcos and his cronies were part of the problem.  But they are not the only problem.  Also his ""I'm not anti-Aquino"" is just a weak shield of deflecting accusations that he could be biased for Marcos.  In my opinion, it would have been better if he actually said outright what is wrong with the Aquino government.  I would find many things I could agree with him on that regard."
Philippines,3dq1tu,Vordeo,2,Sat Jul 18 10:15:25 2015 UTC,"Article is a piece of crap.  I'll be the first to admit that Marcos did some good, but to excuse his sins because some people did alright (Ilocanos especially, and apparently the author is from there) during his presidency is complete bullshit.    I'm sorry, but when you can brush off the murders of thousands of people with a line like:   I concede that some dissidents may have suffered during that time, but did rebels and communists seriously believe they would be handled with kids’ gloves by the very government they wished to overthrow and the social order they wanted to overturn?    Your opinion means jack.  Not everyone who the Marcos regime jailed / murdered was a rebel or a communist, and trivializing so many deaths like that is absolutely disgusting.  He then goes on to compare Marcos to Mahathir and Lee Kuan Yew.  Yeah, those guys were totalitarian rulers, but the difference is, they got results.  By every economic measure, Marcos' reign was an absolute disaster for the country, and brought the country backwards.  Again, economics shouldn't be the only thing MArcos' legacy is based on, but the author seems absolutely determined to ignore thousands of murders, so whatever."

Edit: Alot
Philippines,3dq1tu,justsayinithowitisyo,-1,Sat Jul 18 10:10:13 2015 UTC,"That is a bullshit argument. Don't tell me that if our current leaders had the balls to borrow loans for the betterment of the country you wouldn't gladly accept the benefits with open hands and actually give a shit about the creditors. And DW about the creditors, they have the biggest debt out of any nation in the world. Get a basic understanding of global economics and see how terribly flawed the financial system really is. The US has infinite amount of money because its a debt based currency. And some of it still trickles through down to the ph through military projects mostly, and I haven't seen you complaining about it. ph receives more economic benefits from the US than almost every other asian nation. A relationship that was developed greatly by marcos and the US has honored by not calling back their debt. I am sure marcos was aware that the value of the US dollars he borrowed was not backed by any commodities, like gold. As that is common knowledge with any leader. Hence making the US asking for it back a fruitless endeavor."
Philippines,3dq1tu,Vordeo,2,Sat Jul 18 11:56:16 2015 UTC,"That is a bullshit argument.   That a lot of the Marcos spending / corruption was financed by excessive borrowing?  Nope, it's actually pretty logical.   Don't tell me that if our current leaders had the balls to borrow loans for the betterment of the country you wouldn't gladly accept the benefits with open hands and actually give a shit about the creditors.   A.) When they're skimming off a good part of it like the Marcoses were I'd certainly have a problem with it.  B.) When debt gets to an untenable level, I certainly wouldn't be happy with adding more.   Get a basic understanding of global economics and see how terribly flawed the financial system really is.   I've a degree in economics and an MBA from a globally ranked programme.  Sure, there are flaws in the global financial system, but from your post you clearly don't understand what those are.   ph receives more economic benefits from the US than almost every other asian nation.   We're either 5th or 6th, depending on which metric you're looking at.  Regardless, that statement is pretty damn misleading.   A relationship that was developed greatly by marcos   Yes, which he developed by basically not being a communist country.  Oh, and by being a former colony of the US.    I'm sure you'll give credit for that to Marcos too.   Hence making the US asking for it back a fruitless endeavor.   You REALLY have no idea how the global economy works.  Honestly, end of the day, if you don't want to listen to reason you don't need to, but please try to stop spreading misinformation."

Like last weekend, may mall tour yung Us. I'm like who the hell are those. Pero Madami pa din tao. Although not stadium madami. And libre lang siya.   But I think tatauhin pa rin ang artic.

Philippines,3do8ii,limewithtwist,2,Sat Jul 18 00:46:32 2015 UTC,"Point taken. People will still watch. It will just be hard to recuperate the expenses especially with bands like Arctic Monkeys, tickets will be like 10k upwards and with not so many following here, I don't know which production would be willing to gamble. Now, Incubus on the other hand... I'm not really sure what made them popular here but when they perform, people are always flocking. Ticket prices are cheap too."
Philippines,3do8ii,bac0nologist,2,Sat Jul 18 01:46:38 2015 UTC,"According the price list that went around the interwebs last year, artic monkeys can be had for 100k USD. List here . Although, we can assume their price might be a bit higher now. Let's say they are at the 125-175 range.   If you get araneta which can seat 16500 for a concert and average the ticket price to about 1000 per, that's 16.5 million. I guesstimate, one night for araneta would be about 2-3m. If you go moa, they ask for share of gross, which lessens the risk somewhat. Income from seats should cover all expenses with some extra.   10k up seats are for front row only. To compare to another band that had a concert here that is in the same 125 price range, The Script VIP seats went for 8000 plus charges. (I only compared their set price, not musically)  Then you get sponsors, depending on the legwork done can gross double that. This is where the real profit comes in.   Totally doable. It's just a matter of having them have a tour in the area and find an open date. They probably won't fly into SEA just for the Philippines."

You see, I could eat three cups of rice per meal and still have a consistent 48-50kg weight. I realize that I should use my metabolism as an advantag to have toned body. (I'm a girl btw, 5""2 height)  Does anyone know a specific exercise/program for this kind of goal?"
Philippines,3do8ii,NotAutomatic,6,Sat Jul 18 08:24:59 2015 UTC,"One thing that should be common knowledge is that there is no spot reduce. You cannot lose fat in your arms without losing in your stomach. Also the last thing that will hold fat is the belly area because it stores much of the fat.  In this light, you're main goal should be lose weight and make everything firm.  Losing weight is all bout calories out being higher than calories in. So the best routine I can say is to do HIIT exercises, search it up. Then add in weight training (maybe a PPL routine - PULL/PUSH/LEGS. You're a girl, I love it when girls are very much into legs exercises. Squats, lunges, leg curls, leg extensions :)"

Philippines,3do8ii,ElochQuentis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:23:24 2015 UTC,"Keto was great for losing the fat and I really enjoyed the food choices. My best progress was 10lbs lost in a month last April.  I stopped Keto a couple months ago when I started Stronglifts because I've read that low-carb diets and lifting/building muscle are not really compatible (unless you follow Ketogains, I think?). Also, keto+cardio results to a skinny-fat look lol so you should really complement it with some form of resistance training."
Philippines,3do8ii,PM_ME_ABOUT_CEBU,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:24:21 2015 UTC,"Problem is, there's no specific exercise for this goal. It's mostly in the diet and the exercise becomes an accessory.  If what you say is true about 3 cups of rice, maybe you should retain your carb intake and eat more protein (40% protein, 30% both carb and fats). We don't really know what 3 cups of rice really is to you, it could be your only diet for the day and that you might only be hitting enough calories before you start to gain weight. Like NotAutomatic said, it's about calorie counting. Nobody trains to make a certain part bigger, it should be in proportion.  Although for exercises, I would recommend putting on top of your existing exercise core training, circuits and grip training. But if you're still new to lifting, SL 5x5 should be a start and add accessory exercises at the end (e.g.: bicep curls), you just need somebody to train you to lift because Squats/Deadlifts are very technical and demanding lifts."

Even if we pretend we can somehow increase our GDP to the point we can afford a deterrence, logistically/corruption/bureaucracy we can't even build an airport that is not a national embarrassment.  There is only 1 way we can build an independent military deterrence against China: go nuclear. Other than that we need allies to depend on, either the US and their coalition (Korea, Japan, etc) or we somehow get ASEAN to actually cooperate and build a regional military deterrent force (haha, never will happen).  So, while I agree putting all our eggs in the US' basket is stupid its either that or kowtow to Beijing. I will add, I do believe there is another option but its a stretch. Skip ASEAN, that org is a bunch of dumb toothless monkeys anyway, and move to unite the naval components of Vietnam, Japan and us (Taiwan would be great but that would force China to initiate war) under a single Centcom, independent of the US."

Philippines,3dmlit,grittycotton,0,Sun Jul 19 04:14:10 2015 UTC,"First, deterrence is a very complicated concept, but your simplification is simply incorrect. To simplify the concept and away from nuclear weapons and relative to this context, it would be far more correct to say deterrence is the ability to inflict enough damage onto an invader that the cost of such is a deterrence against invasion.  In NO way does that constitute being superior or even equal. In fact, the entire concept of deterrence revolves around the idea of what is the minimal necessary to achieve it.  So, in this context, upgrading our military and not even getting to the point where we could deter an attack by China is a pointless waste of money. So when you said ""upgrade"", there is either the goal of achieving deterrence or just pissing money down the toilet.

That is not a battle which we can reasonably expect to win, ships are a whole lot more expensive than bullets.  There is little point in preparing for a battle that nobody expects to fight.  If you are imagining a full scale invasion and occupation I can only ask - why? For what gain?"

Philippines,3dly0k,sirmiseria,3,Fri Jul 17 15:05:08 2015 UTC,"Philippines:  Marcos borrowed 26b during his reign.  Foreign banks didn't care where money went as long as they get paid and get paid their interest.  Loans are in US dollars.    Marcos used loans on hotels for IMF conference,  Bataan nuclear plant which was defective and dangerous,  and a lot of it went to their and their cronies coffers.    In the early 80s, Philippine pesos collapsed and so it takes more to pay and service the loans from the National budget (which was pesos) because the loans were designated in US dollars.    1986 comes and Philippines is darling of the world for successful revolution against a dictator.  Philippines hoped to renegotiate the loans and get some reprieve....through lower interest and also longer term and some rescission of fraudulent loans.  Philippines also needed additional loans to support its growth agenda and trade.    Creditors required Philippines government to comply with certain conditions such as austerity measures,  higher taxes,  restoration of Congress etc.  Philippine complied and wanted now to get loans and reprieve from loans of Marcos government.    Creditors didn't give any liberality and forced us to sign an agreement where we basically acknowledged all the loans from Marcos Regime and same terms as previously negotiated with Marcos in order to get the new loans/bailout we needed.  We had no choice but to say yes because we desperately needed new loans for cash flow purposes (trade and national budget).  As to Greece,  similar situation.  European banks loaned tons of monies to Greece.  Greece though used the loans for many non revenue generating activities like to pay pensions,  to fund the Athens 2004 Olympics,  etc.  Eventually,  due to world economic crisis in 2008,  Greece didn't have enough funds to service it's debts.  It needed a bailout of new loans.  Creditors said sure but implement austerity,  raise taxes,  etc.  Greece did that.  Their economy contracted further as a result.  Come 2015, they need more funds because their economy has not been growing.  Creditors say no money unless you agree to all the terms we want.  Greece agrees because it has no choice.  In this case,  both Greece and creditors were irresponsible because Greece used past loans irresponsibly while banks continued lending and didn't care how money is used as long as they get paid principal and interest."

No human love lasts forever, because there is no forever in this context. Sa wikang pinoy: Walang Forever.  The next time you love someone again, choose someone and love that person every moment you can because you can never have too much of cherishing that love. Love before you can see an inch of disappointment or change that will happen again between you and your future love interest.  There may not be a forever, but there's a now and that's the most we can do. To love other people love as much as we can while the opportunity lasts."

He claimed his brother experienced a culture shock upon leaving the PMA campus to join the Armed Forces. Apparently, they were taught all about nobility and absolute obedience to law in school, but they were forced to adapt to the military's corrupt culture after graduating. My friend's brother, in order to show to his men that he is tough, was pressed by his own platoon sergeant, older to him by 15 years, to give the order to summarily execute two alleged NPA rebels they caught somewhere in Leyte. This event traumatized his brother that he went back to their hometown in Bicol, relatively near to Leyte, briefly and confess to their parents. The family kept it a secret and my friend only told me about it about four years after it happened. I'm no longer in touch with my friend now so I don't know if his brother was able to move on after that."

The Filipino culture is not a thing ascribed only to a certain point in the past. Our way of life now may have been different had we not gone through hundreds of years of occupation but we can't discount the fact that our tenacity as a people allowed us to place our own brand in what could have otherwise been just a mishmash of various borrowed cultures. Embrace your nation. What we have now should not be thought of as inferior to what we could have had, otherwise, we are just pissing at the sacrifices of those who died to free us."

If something were to happen (like you break some shit) then they can file a claim up to the amount of the security deposit -- but that is a process that takes 48 hours after you've already checked out and you will be notified by airbnb if the host is making a claim and you'll have to agree to any charges.  So you really have nothing to worry about!  With airbnb no money ever changes hands -- it's all done through your credit card, so never give cash to your host for anything.  note: sometimes when you see a high security deposit amount it could mean that there's somehting very valuable the owner is worried about. Like a rug made of 3 month old virgin alpacas or something. You might want to ask the host what it is that's so valuable so you can take extra precautions while you're staying there."

That is until Marcos abolished the said constitution and replaced it with 1973 Constitution wherein he became almost a president (or dictator) for life. That is why the 1986 Constitution put this limit. Actually we are not the only country with term limits. Marami sa Latin American and Asian countries ang may ganito. Kahit gaano kaabit nung naelect mong leader, pag matagal yan sa pwesto, macocorrupt yan. Gagamitin nya yung first term nya to consolidate power. Succeeding elections would be mere formalities. Just look at Singapore and to some extent Japan (though I would say democratic pa rin kasi yung mismong ruling party may awayan).  Scary preposition. If he said that, I will not vote for him."

Philippines,3dlx4n,blueheals,2,Fri Jul 17 10:46:09 2015 UTC,That's just withholding tax for the government to keep track that a transaction occurred. The contractor will eventually pay the remaining amount on his/her own.
Philippines,3dlx4n,sinagtala,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:45:05 2015 UTC,"So aside from the 2% withholding tax, the contractor must pay the annual withholding tax in his/her own? Looks like the huge pay isn't worth."
Philippines,3dlx4n,sinagtala,2,Fri Jul 17 14:07:08 2015 UTC,"Are you sure that you only need to pay 2% in income tax? This sounds dodgy and if it's legal I'd be utilizing this lol. It's more plausible that the company is only withholding 2% and you're still on the hook for the rest.  I had the same experience freelancing for a local company. They only withhold 10% from each pay. But I had to pay the remaining 22% during the annual filing.  I'd presume your company files the amount they withheld from you. So there's a paper trail and the BIR knows how much you earned, and how much you owe them."
Philippines,3dlx4n,marfillaster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:43:41 2015 UTC,"Well that's what they are offering, 2% withholding tax monthly. It's really tempting to push through since it's going to more net income. But if the contractor will be owing BIR the rest of the withholding tax for the I.T.R., it's not a good idea after all.  Majority of the recruitment firms here in the Philippines are now following this scheme. And most of those aren't including mandatory benefits (PHIL, PAG, SSS), since it's just a contractual base."

Isa pa, sa dalang nila mag-update ng litrato (once every 3-5 years) sa mga residential area, magbabago at magbabago pa rin ang lugar na gusto mong manmanan kung magnanakaw ka. Ano yun, aasa ka sa picture nila ng hindi ka gumagawa ng stakeout para di ka mahuli?"

Philippines,3dl1zj,_ddc,6,Fri Jul 17 03:23:09 2015 UTC,"They're not really technical terms, but ""hiking"" usually refers to walking in rougher terrain for longer distances, mostly on some sort of marked trail. ""Mountain climbing"" would refer to needing your hands, or perhaps ropes and other specialized equipment, where no trails exist.  I'm not familiar with hiking in the Philippines, but here are some general tips:   Never hike alone. If your companions want to turn back, you turn back as well. Even small problems like a twisted ankle can become big problems when you're alone in the mountain. Plan your route ahead of time and let someone know where you're going, and when you expect to return. This makes it easier for rescuers to locate you if necessary. Use proper equipment. Wrong equipment will make you suffer needlessly. A sturdy pair of boots, good socks, wicking shirts, and good pants will keep you dry and comfortable. A dedicated GPS could be a good idea if you're going beyond marked trails. But remember that you have to carry everything you pack in, so bring only what you need. Stay safe. Bring a first aid kit. Bring rain gear and a flashlight. Bring food and water, or at least water purifier tablets. Wear a hat. Use sunscreen on exposed skin. Pay attention to weather reports. Learn about local wildlife. Learn how to spot common poisonous plants, insects, and animals, and know what to do when confronted by various predators. Know your limits. Excess fatigue can lead to mental and physical mistakes and injuries. Walking five miles in an air-conditioned shopping mall is very different than five miles with a 3,000 ft elevation gain in hot weather. 3,000 ft elevation gain is very different starting from sea level than starting from 8,000 ft where the air is thinner.   The key here is to have respect for nature. Things can turn against you in an instant, and you'll be far away from any help. Start with short, easy hikes to learn your own limits. Stay smart and safe, and it'll be a rewarding, healthy, and affordable hobby. Enjoy!"
Philippines,3dl1zj,fabledlamb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:58:13 2015 UTC,thank you for the enlightenment i will certainly take that in mind..

Philippines,3dl1zj,maroonmartian9,4,Sun Jul 19 07:32:03 2015 UTC,http://www.pinoymountaineer.com/ Try this site. Lots of tips. I've tried climbing some mountains in the past and usually with my org in UP. Most I would say are amateurs compared with UP Mountaineers.   Tip ko siguro if you'll go hiking? Prepare and bring lots of water. And better if marami kayo.
