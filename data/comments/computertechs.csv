Highlighting 1000 instances of an ask toolbar that are just all files of a single install is as bad as programs that count every cookie and every temp file as an infection to be cleaned. Malwarebytes didn't use to work this way.
computertechs,3e08q4,T-HO-THA-MALE-HOOKER,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:00:07 2015 UTC,"It's worked like this for years. This way the whole program gets removed as opposed to the EXE or whatever you want it to be flagging.  The count is just returning how many items it is flagging for deletion. These are things that are actually causing problems on computers rather than cookies from a MSN.  PUPs are an actual problem. Most AVs don't pick them up and people download them by the truckload. The fact that MBAM flags them is a godsend and saves me time from having to sit through and pick them out one by one (Let's be real, I use other cleaning tools because redundancy, but whatever). Just admit you're being contrarian."
computertechs,3e08q4,Whitellama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:17:03 2015 UTC,It's been years now but it hasn't always been this way. It use gk be pretty abnormal to have malware bytes hit multi hundreds and maybe a thousand plus. Now it's common place for basically nothing. I ran a scan yesterday that hit 3000+ all for an ask toolbar. That's a bit ridiculous and unnecessary.   For a comparison in how this is done with other utilities try out adwcleaner. They'll list it once and remove the whole thing. I often find it more effective than mwb and runs in a quarter of the time.   I'm not being contrarian towards anything. This is just something I'm noticing more and more with this tool. If you still like it and it works for you that's great. For me though I've noticed its not what it once was and ill usually opt for something else.

The contest also includes client or customer facing issues pertaining to intake or resolution of a customer installation or repair. Students must demonstrate basic ability to configure & secure SOHO networks, manage client side virtual machines, basic understanding of Windows registry, use of remote assistance software to support remote clients, comprehensive knowledge of commands, and work with mobile devices. In addition, the contestants take the A+ Certification exam. Their score on this exam is used as the basis for the written portion of the contest, and contestants who pass the exam receive their A+ Certification.  List of contests"

If you want a solid understanding Net+ (preferably CCNA or Juniper version) and a cert from your operating system/area of choice should be fine (MCSA for windows, vcp for vmware, rhcsa for linux etc).   Honestly 14k is way overpriced for information you can teach yourself (assuming that's an option for you based on learning techniques) - especially since you aren't even getting a degree. You'd be better off building your own homelab (that you can use in the future as well) and learning the material on your own."

Unless you are coming from, say an English degree background, and have zero IT or even basic PC knowledge, I don't think you'll find the $13k to be well invested.  As has been said, spending a couple hundred bucks on a decent home lab server will teach you everything you need to know about anything you want to know.  For a ""foot in the door"" resume fodder, get an A+ and/or NET+ plus a cert or two on your platform of choice as /u/sfw247 said.

As a part of the community you have access to other members via the various forums where you'll learn how others in your situation ran (or run) and grow their businesses.   For example they have a private Facebook group that only members can access. In that group we constantly discuss topics ranging from what services to offer, to how to make more money from your existing services. We're always reviewing different products and services so that others know what's worth offering to their clients. If you have a problem with a service that sponsors the ACRBO the president of the ACRBO himself has been known to hop on the phone with these companies and resolve issues for the members.  I started as a one-man shop, and the ACRBO welcomed me with open arms. The value of what I've learned, and continue to learn from the members more than pays for the small yearly membership dues.  Is the ACRBO worth joining? In the 3 or 4 years that I've been a member I've been able to, through the things I've learned through the ACRBO and it's members, to more than double my profit, grow my company into a regional powerhouse, and foster connections and even friendships with colleagues all over the world.

It'll save you money compared to doing that program through Ashworth, and it'll probably be worth about the same from an employers perspective. From there you can likely find a Help Desk or other Desktop Support position somewhere and gain actual hands on experience. You'll likely decide where you want to go from there. Again, this is just my personal opinion, and you may do better from a structured learning system like what Ashworth is offering.  For programming, you'll definitely need to spend a lot of your own time learning and doing projects. Many companies look for some sort of portfolio (e.g. have some stuff up on github). I would highly suggest taking a look at /r/learnprogramming to see what that field is like."

computertechs,3dsih7,elearningcenter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:46:54 2015 UTC,"You will probably end up either needing to get an industry certification or getting some work experience, or at least have a small portfolio of programming projects you've done.   You need to be able to show you can do the job, that's what's most important to the employer. And even if you had a AS or Bachelors from a traditional college/uni, a prospective employer is still going to vet your technical abilities, especially if there's a lack of previous experience on your resume. Same goes for certifications. In other words, the papers will help you get into the interview room, but knowing your stuff and being able to do the job is what's going to land you the position.  A completion certificate from Ashworth is probably good enough to get you into an entry level position and from there, the world is your oyster. I highly recommend seeking internships or legitimate work experience while your in school, if you haven't already."

When the disc drive is engaged, first in POST and then when the tray returns to the bay, the hissing sounds like the spindle motor is binding; meeting resistance when trying to rev up from a complete stop until it hits the higher RPMs. It might be fixable just by lubricating the motor if that's the issue, but worst case scenario is a drive replacement for ~$25.  If you even want to bother with an optical drive in these modern times where solid state storage has made discs all but obsolete, your best bet would be to spend the same amount of money on an external DVD-RW drive rather than an internal one so you get the bonus of portability. I've got a broken LightScribe drive that's been serving as a drive bay filler in my tower for years because the last time I had a use for one was for burning CDs to listen to in the car (before I got a smartphone and discovered the wonders of Pandora)."

This is their latest client from a week or two ago, but they still say it doesn't technically support Win10.

computertechs,3dp5y2,MentorScythe,2,Sat Jul 18 02:53:54 2015 UTC,"If you've already replaced the mobo and RAM, the process of elimination dictates that it's more than likely a CPU issue.  When I first started doing this some 10-15 years ago a co-worker bestowed upon me these words of wisdom; ""A CPU will either POST or it won't"", meaning that if you're not getting a POST screen and you've already changed out the RAM (and in your case, the motherboard too) then the CPU is the culprit.  Looking at the CPU for problems won't do you any good. Unless you have a CPU fetish that is. You won't always be able to visibly see damage to an electronic component. Sometimes they just fail."

Processors are generally the last component to die in a system but their lifespan can be reduced by insufficient heat management, which could be the causal issue behind the CPU failure in that laptop. Especially if the heatsink fins were obstructed by dust, or the cooling system didn't have sufficient airflow from spending a lot of time sitting on a lap/blanket/etc that obstructed the cool air intake and/or exhaust ports.  Does the CPU heat spreader not have ANY identifying markings? If you can't match it via a part number I suppose your next best option would be to look up compatible processors for that particular model of motherboard via Google and go from there. If you knew the CPU speed of the original it would narrow it down to what replacement part to order, but if you get a list of compatible CPUs you can price shop for whichever is the best fit for the customer depending on price-to-speed."
computertechs,3dn1ic,applegingerbrandy,6,Fri Jul 17 16:30:07 2015 UTC,"A minor in CS is more than what a lot of people in IT have. A lot of HR departments will forgive the fact you don't have certs if you have a degree, but only the good HR departments will let your resume thru if you have certs and experience but no degree.  If you're comfortable with programming for a living, you'd may want to start there considering you make more money starting off and then it increases exponentially when compared to IT support roles. Also, since you create value instead of maintain it, management tends to see you as an asset rather than a liability... until some exec wants an in-ground pool this year and outsources development to make the short-term numbers look good. But that danger exists for all positions so I wouldn't worry about it.  As far as search terms, just add the terms ""junior"" to any position and you'll find some entry level work. Like ""Junior .NET Developer"" ""Junior Network Administrator"" ""Junior System Administrator."" Help desk is a good entry level position as well and teaches you the fundamentals of team-based IT, escalations and service tiers.  Finally, a grand majority of IT work is found near major cities and along the trail of internet backbones. IT work does exist in more rural and suburban parts of the US, but the competition is usually fierce, since many people apply and are qualified for the position, and the job market is a sellers market in those areas so the company can get the highest quality talent for a low price.  The prevailing entry level certification is the CompTIA A+ certification. It's extremely cheap ($400) and teaches the bare fundamentals of hardware, software, operating systems and customer support. Pretty much every IT tech starts out with one but don't expect it to get you a job by itself -- the exam is so easy that the amount of people with the active certification is inflated so it's undervalued. After this you should start to plan where you want to specialize in for the next few years and get one or more certs in that area of expertise. (I recommend VMWare!)  Good luck!"

computertechs,3dn1ic,ThBurninator,4,Fri Jul 17 18:39:17 2015 UTC,"As someone who was in a similar situation not that long ago, you definitely have a chance of getting a job, so there's that. My advice is from my experience, so it may not be applicable to everyone:   Certs: I don't have any certs of my own, but as long as you have a solid technical understanding of the basics, show an interest to learn new things, and have at least some relevant experience, you have a good chance at getting interviews at the least. If you want to get certs, more power to you, but in many cases they aren't required, they just help show an interviewer where you already have some knowledge. As for keywords, it's kind of tough to narrow that down. Some places will use the generic ""desktop support"" or ""help desk"", which could be anything really (answering phones and doing simple user support, to hardware or specific software support), but some places will be more specific depending on what they need supported and to what capacity. Customer service and interviewing well are definitely a plus (especially if the place that is hiring is looking specifically for custom-facing support). If you can get your hands on some old computers to tear apart, that definitely helps to get you familiar, but to know what all those parts are and what they do, find some technical sites or blogs that follow topics you are interested in (this also helps give you some conversation points about tech you may be interested in).   Like I said, my experience may not really be applicable, but I was in your shoes not long ago and thought I would share. A couple miscellaneous pointers:   One thing to remember is that there are plenty of places that need people like you, but they may not be right next door (my first job I got hired at was over an hour away from where I live). If you have reliable transportation, and are willing to travel a bit, your options increase significantly.  If you do get an offer from one place, don't automatically assume you are going to be there forever. Know how to identify a place as a dead end, or a bad work place. Last thing: don't be afraid to ask questions. I know it may seem like you are being annoying, but in my experience, as long as you aren't asking the same questions over and over, it looks really good if you actively try to learn new things and don't just accept that something works.   After all that, good luck, and sorry for the wall of text."

Also, you'll want to do some research into the types of tickets they get frequently so you can knock out the easy stuff.   Take a look at whatever documentation they keep for typical fixes, frequent problems, etc. If there are problems you need to fix that are out of the norm, be sure to fully document them for reference later (for example, create a KB in their ticketing system if you can), so everyone can use it.   If they tend to do a lot of proactive work by way of monitoring alerts, see if you can find things that frequently alert, appear to ""falsely"" alert (if it alerted, it was for a reason), and work on just generally cleaning up noise or fixing things that typically break often.

computertechs,3dkr21,WissNX01,2,Sat Jul 18 00:44:54 2015 UTC,"One of the first things I had to sort out was the utter disorganization and the politics of the workplace.  I had to answer to three co-owners technically.  One never bothered with me, one was agreeable to what I needed to accomplish my work, and one was hellbent on catching me for anything that can be used to terminate me.  I learned fast who and how to manipulate in order to accomplish my work.  Technically speaking, I picked up on Active Directory, Exchange, and VPNs pretty quickly.  It was a mortgage company at the height of the housing bubble, so they had three offices, one was the main office that had most of the agents, the second was more of a training facility for new hires, and the third office was some kind of hangout for the owners.  My most pressing task was getting the training facility up to snuff.  At the time, most of the hardware was Pentium 3s and a few early Pentium 4s.  Most of the units didn't work, and those that did had major software issues.  I managed to cobble together the hardware that did work and solve most of the software and licensing issues to get around a dozen units to be useful.  The other thing that was most important at the time was getting them compliant with the Sarbanes Oxley Act.  They failed an audit by their largest lender before I was hired, and had some time to get compliant.  Most of the deficiencies were how they handled documents and transferred them to and from different processors in different offices.  This became a major deal because some of what was required to be compliant was spending some money on proper software and hardware.  We managed to roll out a Server 2003 domain controller and exchange server.  Their CRM and loan software was also able to run the new servers, so that was a bonus.  Getting everything to work while everyone bitched about it was probably the worst part.  And really, the most useful skill I learned was dealing with people.

computertechs,3djs7z,Malcolm746,4,Thu Jul 16 21:00:44 2015 UTC,"Start by working through this sub's history; ""how to start"" is fairly often asked here and you'll get lots of additional insight from contributors not here right now.   Start by deciding if you want to go to the client, or want them to come to you. If the latter, you would be better off looking for work in existing repair shops. If you would rather go to them (better paying, but more demanding of your skills) then consider how you can get your name in front of them: flyers, adverts, yada yada. Don't ignore word of mouth if you've already worked for others: I go to my clients, and find 1/3rd of my new clients are from word of mouth.  If you also go it alone, you will have many more ""not successful"" visits in the beginning because you will have a much wider variety of challenges that often aren't even technical: interpersonal skills especially.   Less important than what you charge is what you do when you don't fix, and what you do if you don't know the answer. If I can't fix, I don't charge. If I don't know, I'll say so and ""stop the clock"" while I learn the answer. If you charge $10ph, you'll get $10ph clients; charge $100ph and you'll get $100ph clients - the latter are definitely better to work for, even with the money value.  Certs are a waste of time working for yourself - Experience is King. Working for a larger shop may see certs make sense.  And you last question: you should remove the laptop hdd and connect it to a known clean machine which can then itself clean the viruses at full speed. Once back in the laptop you can more quickly finish it off. Good luck!"

It's called Maginetix, (www.maginetix.com). I never imagined investing my salary in a small shop like this but it's been fun and rewarding! So here are my responses to your questions and I highly encourage you to take large leaps in moving your ideas forward!  1 - Charging what others in the local industry charge sounds okay. We charge extra bc we provide free diagnostics (unlike the competition on the other side of town). Here are our prices for our most common services: Format OS = $350 MXN, Remove virus = $250 MXN, Install software = $200 MXN and internal cleaning = $100 MXN.  2 - None of us here have any certs. but we use centOS for all of our internal servers (webserver, email and pbx). If anything, I wish that I had gotten a cert in cisco or some networking topic. I think it would help in finding jobs around here. I'm sorry I don't have more to say for this question.  3 - When Adlice's Rogue Killer and CCleaner don't remove the infection in Safe Mode. I use Comodo bc the free version is the same as the paid version minus the phone support - plus they focus more on using sandbox technology rather than detction-based-technology.  I hope this is at least helpful or entertaining to read. Also I wish you well in your endeavors."

computertechs,3dhmh7,Grunyan,2,Thu Jul 16 14:25:53 2015 UTC,"Not really a physical/technical feat but I'm acquiring quotes right now for large cabling jobs that require fiber in conduit that is jam-packed. It was going to cost a shit-load of money to trace the cables in the conduit to see what was live and what can be cut out (since coring wasn't an alternative due to the location).  But I have fiber up to a higher floor, it was just 2 strand and I couldn't pull it back due to it feeding a high-impacting area.  Turns outs they just labeled it wrong after I investigated and opened the cable up. It's 2 strand terminated, but 6 strand total which means I've got a work-around in place by splicing from those strands down the many floors to the IDF I need.   The lesson is: It's nice to label stuff but label stuff properly and don't always depend on previous persons' labels to be correct all the time.  (Note: you can get 2 strand fiber apparently but it's special order so it's always cheaper to run the 6strand)"

No matter, we've been getting a huge influx of infected Macs lately. I think we had one or two my first year working as a tech, but something happened in the past few months and we've been getting at least one or two in a week.

I wasn't asking questions as many anymore, I was being asked. Sure, I'd still ask questions if I didn't have a path to go down, but I was definitely being asked more than asking.   It takes time.

Taking good notes will help you remember the solutions and keep you from asking the same question twice.  This simple step makes it easier to show that you are making progress and growing.
computertechs,3deerm,dethandtaxes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:47:27 2015 UTC,dont' be afraid to ask questions.  BUT if it is an option.. google it first.  Try to ask questions away from customers.  never ask the same question more than twice and if it still confuses you let someone know.  Also if you have questions it helps to have the right information to give the person your asking.  Formal training in break repair isn't easy cause problems are rarely the same.. it is just easier to take it as it comes.

I worked doing helpdesk for about 1.5 years and got my A+, Net+, WinXP, and Active Directory certs.  I then started working for the tech dept at a local school system as a technician - resume looked great, interview went well, the whole nine yards.  The first day on the job, I was lost.  I realized that even though I had built computers my whole life and did remote support (albiet, mainly scripted) for a bit, I knew nothing.  I started in early February while trouble tickets were still high, so it was definitely a trial by fire.  Once summer vacation hit in early June, I finally felt confident in the job I was doing.  Nearly 7 years later, I'm still there.  I still feel mostly confident, but there are still times when I have to take a step back and ask a coworker what they're seeing on an issue.  You'll never know everything, but you'll see enough weird issues that eventually you can at least feed the right info into the Google machine.  When we get newer hires, I never mind answering their questions - no matter how mundane I think they may be.  I only get frustrated when I get asked the same questions over and over.  Like others have said, just take notes/commit to memory the things you are learning now and build on them.  We've all been where you are now, and we all drove our coworkers crazy trying to soak up the right information and get with the program.  Just stay committed to learning everything you can while staying sane, and the next time you get a new hire, you'll ""pay for your raising"" as he/she drives you crazy with questions!"

Using your numbers, my invoice might say:  7.0 Hours - Bench Service - $30/hr - $210.00  Friends and Family Discount - ($105) - ($105)  Total: $105  I probably wouldn't charge a full 7 hours, though. When I'm working on something like this in my home office there's plenty of other stuff I can do while waiting for the laptop to reboot, defrag, update, virus scan etc. I can surf Reddit, watch TV, etc. So while I might put ""7 hours"" into the computer, I might actually only work 3-4 hours.   Anyway, a few years back I noticed that when I added the ""Friends & Family Discount"" I'd often get MORE money than I would just invoicing them a certain amount directly. For instance, if I charged $40, they'd pay me $40. But if I charged $80 and discounted that to $40, they'd often give me $50 or $60 instead. Don't know why, but it works."

I'm not going to increase the $60 but I might put that I would charge for that if she wasn't somehow related to me.
computertechs,3dc7ol,Paul_Swanson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:47:28 2015 UTC,"I probably wouldn't charge more for that, but I always include a ""work performed"" page where I list all the work I did. That way they can see right there, in black and white, what was done to their computer. This comes from my business clients, who sometimes want to know EXACTLY what they're paying for.   To be honest, I do tend get a bit wordy and sometimes make things sound more involved than they actually are. Instead of just saying something like:   ""reset domain password""    I might say something like:   ""User tried accessing network share but received 0x0800535 error. I accessed desktop remotely and attempted to login to the network share, but received same message. According to Microsoft's knowledge base, the 0x0800535 error indicates an expired password. I remotely accessed domain controller and reset password via AD Users & Computers. Had user reboot their computer, and they logged in successfully.""    Again, this is because of small business clients. Had I just put ""reset password"" they might question why that cost $65. But if I include all the troubleshooting steps, it sounds much more involved.  Lastly, if this helps, I also have a few clients I bill monthly or semi-monthly. Instead of billing them individually for each and every password reset or restarted print spooler, I'll bill them for 4-5 such incidents on one invoice. Even if you ultimately end up charging the same amount, people feel like you're nickel and diming them with the small invoices. In my experience, they're happier paying one $240 invoice for four incidents than four $60 invoices."

computertechs,3dc7ol,zoom1200,4,Wed Jul 15 06:46:14 2015 UTC,"Ok a couple things.  You did not spend 7 hours behind her keyboard working on her computer.  Probably 80% of that was scan times and updating, at least it should be.  At my shop we charge $65 an hour but for virus removal it's usually just a one hour charge because even if it takes 5 hours the vast majority of that time the computer doesn't take my attention.  Now if you also reset her password, did all updates, installed extra programs, defragged, etc, then I could see charging another hour if the customer asked for all these extras.  That being said, you did it for family.  I think a flat $50 or $60 bucks is fine and be sure to tell them all you did and how long it took.  Don't feel any shame when giving her that price, you worked hard for your expertise.  TLDR; $130 for a normal customer (who specially requested all the extras), $50 for family, at least if it was me."
computertechs,3dc7ol,gokou135,4,Wed Jul 15 05:58:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with you here.  In shops I've worked in, it would be similar.    One hour absolute minimum, likely two if some configuration is done.  Most of that time is letting scans run, and even if it takes several hours to run the scans, the actual hands-on time on the machine shouldn't really be longer than an hour or so.  Longer than that and you should have probably assessed it properly and nuked the damn thing in the first place and reinstalled from scratch.  Your average customer would scream blue bloody murder if you went and invoiced them for seven hours.  Two hours is usually the maximum you can invoice before you start hearing dissatisfied noises.  $50 for family.  Consider the seven hours as an investment in your training and understanding how important it is to get these things done in a damn sight less than seven hours."

computertechs,3db6ds,CBRjack,2,Tue Jul 14 23:35:29 2015 UTC,"Some certs are easier than others if you need something to put on your resume to get past HR. Look at the Brocade accreditations, they are 20$ each, done on your pc, and they arr technical sounding enough to get thru HR.  If you are able to study a bit, start by the CCENT. Being able to tell people in interviews that you are currently studying is often well received.  Look up companies online. Apply even if they are not hiring. Worst case, they don't call you back. Better case, they were thinking about hiring someone and you just got in before they advertise the job, bypassing all competition.  Sending resumes by email is cheap, do it, do it again, do it until you run out of bytes to send people. Seriously, most jobs aren't displayed online. Try and talk to people, call their tech support and try to ask about jobs... Don't get discouraged, you will find something better."
computertechs,3db6ds,CBRjack,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:43:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the encouragement. I have 2 VMWare certs that were free about 2 years ago. VCA in Workforce Mobility and Data Center Vrituilization. I thought about putting them on my Resume (I didn't) but they were a joke to get. Watched a few videos and took a test on my PC. That was it. They weren't technical at all either, just more focused on what the products did.  I have been trying to study for the Security+ but with my life how it is right now, finding the time to study is extremely hard."
computertechs,3db6ds,CBRjack,2,Tue Jul 14 23:50:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say put them on. It will help you go thru HR people with no technical expertise.  In larger firms, or enterprise that subcontract their hiring, the process nowadays is automated. They plug resumes in the algorithm, a score comes out, they skim the top for a real interview. Having certifications listed will boost your score.  At the very least, it shows you can learn and it will put you in front of people with no certs.  The job market is fierce, and as you are in an unfortunate position, every little thing you can do to put yourself in a good light should be tried!"

computertechs,3dahri,Coding_Cactus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:37:48 2015 UTC,Almost all our company wide software is remote app based so we just go with the OEM install + RDP shortcuts and mapped drives. If the user does ask for a specific software package it has to be approved through a manager so requests are rare and handled case by case. Windows updates are handled through WSUS. We had default images on a deployment server for a while but found we were spending more time updating the images then actually using them to re-image or clean install.

computertechs,3dahri,OSUTechie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:26:50 2015 UTC,"I would like to do what you do, but there's so much red tape to getting WDS or FOG or anything at all in place at our org.. I'm not betting on it anytime soon.  I keep 4 VMs in client Hyper-V on my office workstation for making my master images: Win7 Enterprise x86/64, Win8.1 Enterprise x64, and Win8.1 Enterprise x64 for UEFI machines. They have all the software I can possibly install already set & ready to go; Installers for other software that isn't sysprep friendly gets left on the root of the OS partition for later. Every patch Tuesday, I update these as necessary, shut them down, backup the .vhdx's, boot them back up, sysprep /generalize each one, shut them down, and then I grab an image of each drive with Backupper. Then I put the pre-sysprep .vhdx's back in place and re-do permissions with icacls via a quick batch file I keep on hand.  Then we locally restore those images to machines with Backupper. I keep some hot-swap SATA cables and power cords on my desk so that if I have tons of machines, I can just pull the drives, pop them on my own workstation, reimage the drive, and pop it back in. Then boot up the machine, run through the OOBE, install drivers, set up the rest of our software(Novell, ZCM, etc) and done.  This method's time varies.. If I'm restoring a Win8.1 image to an SSD, I can be done in 10 minutes or less.  If I'm restoring Win7 to a HDD, more like 30 minutes.  I've got 2 Samsung EVO 850's in my workstation where I create the master images, so actually updating & creating the images is a breeze. (I think it took me about 40 minutes to do all 4 today)  Again, not ideal, but pretty damn swift for having no deployment server of any kind."

I return a new screen protector with each screen replacement.  As for spudgers and pry tools I would buy a few decent metal ones from Amazon for permanent use but the plastic ones that come with most replacement screens will do fine for when you need a plastic tool. They wear out quick but you'll somehow overflow with them anyway.  The few things I might add to your kit would be:    An anti-stat brush (useful for clearing out the crap you've scraped off) A pair of mini pliers (can be used in a pinch to bend a case back into shape so a new screen fits) A few needle files (for rounding sharp edges caused either by the drop or by bending the case back to shape) A scalpel set (or hobby knife set, prescision points come in handy)   None of these are essential but have helped me over the years."

There's some pretty cheap ones on Amazon. Really, they're all about the same in quality, just get one that's the right price.  You mentioned you've got the LOCA setup going. Frankly, I don't have a precision hot-plate, and I don't really want to screw around with replacing just the lens on the phone. I always just buy a whole new assembly. If I ever get to the full-on business point in the game, perhaps I'll go there - if you're just starting out, though, I don't know if it's worth your time.  Also, be sure to sell your customers tempered glass screen protectors. I've made a ton of money on those, especially with display-replacement cases. Of course, I use them on my own devices as well, but I always recommend them to my customers.  Don't go for the cases option, people all have their own tastes. I would suggest that you offer them a list of cases that you suggest, and/or features they should look for. I always suggest hybrid TPU/silicone cases, that have at least a 1/8"" lip on the screen, and cover all of the corners of the phone."

computertechs,3d6wuo,wrecktheinfotech,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:07:52 2015 UTC,"Here's what's in my toolkit (omitting what you've said you have in yours):  1.) Variable-setting heat gun.  Especially useful for iPads, still handy for various phones (great for easily releasing the home button ribbon cable on the iPhone 6/6+ shield plate from the front glass without tearing it).  I like this better than the hot plate because I can put the heat right where I want it.  2.) Various plastic pryers and spudgers/blacksticks.  As noted elsewhere, you can accumulate these easily.  3.) Guitar picks.  Cheap, and make for good pry/slide tools for releasing adhesive without having to worry as much about tearing sensitive cables like you do with metal tools.  4.) iSesamo or iFixit's ""Jimmy"".  Works better than the plastic tools at getting into tight seams.  5.) iSclack.  Makes opening iPhones easier and faster.  Not needed if you're decent with the iSesamo or similar tool, but works a little better/faster.  6.) gTool corner/sidewall/frame tools.  Great for quickly reshaping iPhone/iPad corners, sidewalls, and bent frames so you can get your new glass to sit flat and flush.  7.) Clear packing tape.  Keeps broken glass in place while I'm working on it (and out of my sensitive fingers).  I also offer this as a temporary free solution for clients when they can't get the repair done immediately for whatever reason, so long as their LCD and the touch functionality of the digitizer still works.  Touch function works just fine through the tape.  Use a good safety knife to cut the tape to fit after you've laid it down, so it's not all awkward, and to open up a spot over the ear speaker so they can still hear their calls.  8.) Magnetic screw mat.  You can get fancy and buy the individual ones for the different types of phones, or just use a plain one with a grid on it for everything and organize your screws on it in a way that makes sense to you.  9.) A good LED light.  Makes working on these things much easier.  10.) Anti-static mat w/ wristband.  No ESD in my house.  11.) Check-in form for noting condition of the device when it's brought to you.  Whenever possible, test every function of the device with the client there before you begin the repair.  Always check every function of the device after you've completed the repair.  12.) Charger/rapid chargers and cables for devices.  Clients appreciate getting back a fully-charged phone, and this also lets you test to make sure their device charges properly.  13.) Earbuds.  Use to test audio jack.  I always feel like I'm forgetting something with these sorts of lists, but I think that's got everything covered, minus the tools you already said you have.  For some value-added upselling, I would suggest a couple of items:  1.) Tempered glass.  Easy to demo, and if you're replacing their screen you can almost guarantee they won't have a screen protector.  2.) Cases.  Figure out what the majority of your repairs are (mine are iPhone and Samsung Galaxy, which I think is pretty typical) and carry a few good cases for those.  My thinking is if I sell it, I better be able to stand behind it.  I'm a big fan of Trident cases because of that.  They're military-tested, provide some great protection without being overly bulky, and have QR codes on their packaging that link to great videos of people abusing the snot out of them and still walking away with working phones. I know it's been said here that most people already have cases, but not everyone has a good case.  Carry good cases and you can still make the sale.  3.) Rapid chargers.  They sell themselves, really.  If you need any help sourcing quality parts or accessories like the tempered glass PM me and I'll give you my contacts.  You might also give some thought to going to the Wireless Repair Expo in Vegas this September.  I went last year and learned some great stuff, and also met several of my current trusted vendors.  I think if you hurry you can still register to attend for free."

computertechs,3d3ag8,4GrandmasAndABean,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:21:53 2015 UTC,"I look at malware as just one of many kinds of disasters (malware, fire, hardware failure, theft, etc.). Regardless of the reason, down-time and data loss are bad.   I give my customers a couple of options. They can subscribe to a managed backup service with me. It ain't cheap, but I can provide the fastest recovery of their system using this method. I go through my talk about all the glorious benefits of a managed backup service. In terms of protecting systems and data, this really is the best method, if you have the right tools in place.   If they don't go the managed backup route. No Problem. Regardless of why they're down (virus, hardware failure, software failure, fire, theft, etc.), if I have to use 3rd-party recovery tools to bring their system back to functional, I simply sell the tools to the customer. I just add the price I pay for them to the invoice (plus labor, of course). In addition, there are a lot of good tools out there that are free, but the developer asks for a donation. I make sure the customer knows if I use any of these tools, they're donating $50/tool. I figure that's a good average compared to the price of other malware tools, plus maybe a little bit to offset the schmucks who benefit and don't donate. I'm very clear that this option may still require a full nuke and reinstall of drive. However, I can usually make the non-nuke option work, so it's worth the risk. So now they're paying for tools and labor that they might wind up not needing. That's the risk you take without a managed backup solution. They are responsible to have their own backups of data, keep all installation media and license keys, etc. If I have to nuke the drive, or recover any data, or reinstall an app and they don't have the data necessary to do so, then they're out of luck. Again, that's the risk of not having a managed backup service with me. When you lay out how much time they lose, and how much money they spend, they almost always are willing to move to some sort of monthly managed backup plan.  Finally, if they choose option 2, I have a document they sign which details all this stuff for them, plus a few other negatives to not having a managed backup service. This document is very much read like ""Because you chose this option, you risk this and you DO NOT get that, and you'll pay for this, and this, etc."".They sign it. We each keep a copy. Sometimes making them sign a scary (but accurate) document makes them think twice about not getting a managed backup solution."

Yes of course we are able to still clean computers, Its becoming not worth the time involved if you know how to use Sysprep.  My shop does almost all wipe/reloads if the infection is two or more viruses. Reason being that regardless of what we do, That customer is going to come back. When she does, We can hands down say there is no possible way the computer left the store with a virus. Otherwise you cant really say that, Cause its possible something was missed so the confidence cant really be had without blowing smoke up their bum."

If everyone had all their software installers and product keys it would be easier to just save data and reload but at least around here, people hardly understand that the office they have on their computer was something they bought and that it did not come with windows.  If it's only a few hijacks/bugs and they do come back within the week we just bite the bullet and redo the bug removal. If it is a whole lot of new stuff we'll show them and explain where they likely picked it up from. They do have to pay again but we will discount it usually as a nice gesture.

We will then thoroughly record the file creation dates of the infected files, sort them by date/time and present the information to the customer.   X date/time - computer picked up after cleanup  X date/time + 2 days 4 hrs 29 mins - User clicked on Facebook post ""Test internet IQ!!!""

Malwarebytes, Spybot 2, Winrar, Flash, Adobe Reader, Firefox, Chrome, and Teamviewer. We have to load antivirus after the wipe because you cant pre-install real-time virus software with sysprep, Just breaks your image. We also have all the updates done.   This takes me 5 minutes to put our image on the customers drive with macrium reflect, then 5 minutes to boot the system and install all the drivers with Snappy Driver (Which is preloaded onto the root of all my images). We then activate (Unless its 8, which is already activated.) Install preferred virus software and restore their backups (Estimated at 20 minutes average for the backup as well as the restore.) That comes to 50 minutes. (Granted most times its more like 50 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes depending on the age of my image and how many windows updates have come out.)  Check into Sysprep."

Haha)   Every now and then of course we run into a problem with the outlook settings and have to set outlook back up for them, But as long as you have the name of their email host and their username/password its cake. If they have Office we absolutely re-install it for them if they have the key they can either give it to us so we can activate for them, or they can activate themselves (We typically leave it up to them.) If they cant find their key, They either buy a new one or their happy with Libreoffice.   We charge $65.00 without backups, $85.00 if they want backups and program re-installs."

computertechs,3cspsp,mwk913,9,Fri Jul 10 13:44:44 2015 UTC,It all depends on the program that writes the registry. If their uninstall doesn't remove them they stick around. Something like ccleaner will take care of it though.

computertechs,3cspsp,Dergeist_,2,Fri Jul 10 16:04:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not concerned, I'm curious. I'm not experiencing any problems. I've just heard people say things like ""installing and uninstalling programs will eventually bog the system down because of left over files"". If the registry is designed to be efficient at storage and fast at read/writing, why cant the default windows uninstaller ""clean"" such things? Just a thought, no need to byte my head off - pun intended"
computertechs,3cspsp,rawrsauce,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:36:23 2015 UTC,It's not the windows uninstaller that leaves those files there. Windows just queues the program's built in uninstallation. Left over files are the fault of the program's creator.
computertechs,3cspsp,Dergeist_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:54:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry if that came off as harsh before, just fired the comment quickly between tickets :)  Just to reiterate what others said, leftover stuff in the registry, even a ""bloated"" registry just does not cause issues for modern computers.  Those days were done by the early 2000s.    The registry is still super delicate though, and a couple wrong changes in the wrong places can cause unexpected behavior ranging from weird glitches, to application crashes, to a non-function system.  Most automatic registry cleaners like ccleaner are like taking a sledgehammer to the thing.  You will remove some unnecessary registry keys, sure, but they really aren't harming anything, and you run a much greater risk of doing a lot of collateral damage to the system.  I can't honestly say I would never run a registry cleaner myself again, but be prepared for issues (back up the registry before deletions) and don't expect a miracle.  YMMV, but it's usually just placebo.   why cant the default windows uninstaller ""clean"" such things?   There isn't really a standard windows installer (maybe msiexec, but there are plenty of others just as common).  Regardless, every installer application is basically dumb.  The application programmer writes a set of instructions - create this folder, put this file in the folder, create this registry key, etc. - that gets fed to the installer and the installer does that stuff.  The uninstall process is basically the reverse - delete this, delete that.  There are times application programmers may want to write instructions that deliberately leave stuff behind, maybe some registry keys that contain license or trial information so you can't keep using a demo version of something longer than intended just by uninstalling and reinstalling the application.  Other times, they may leave some entries that have configuration settings, so if you ever reinstall the application, your settings are carried over to the new install.  Other times, they just may not write good removal instructions, because they're lazy, or careless, or just don't care or whatever.  Anyway, hopefully that answers your questions a little better than before.  Edit: a word"

We do a good deal of business with residential as well as companies at those rates. We also do security camera installations/repair and Exede Internet installation and repair.   We charge hourly, But most of the in-shop work is a flat rate based ont he hourly fee. So we charge $45.00 an hour and we base the actual cost on a multiple of the hourly charge, based on what the problem was and what was needed to fix it.  Wipe/Reload is our most common thing wanted, We charge $45.00 for that as well as $20 for the backups. We dont worry about how long something actually took, We are charging for our knowledge not our time."
computertechs,3cm5jr,gokou135,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:14:32 2015 UTC,Small town techie here...  We charge flat rate in our shop. Usually 45-100 for most jobs. We have at least six stations per tech.  I personally charge 60/hour for in home/business stuff but our shop rates for the same thing are 80/hour.  I just can't feel good about charging someone 150 or more for a virus removal unless we save their ass from something like crypto.

computertechs,3ci81f,_j_ryan,3,Wed Jul 8 02:47:21 2015 UTC,"SharePoint is not a product like you're used to.  It's not designed to solve a problem.  It's more of a framework in which you build solutions, with a whole bunch of things built into the framework.  One of the primary benefits of sharepoint is data ownership.  You can give HR, for example, their own place, and it's not much effort to set permissions on that place for different audiences.  Then someone in that department can maintain that data.  You don't have to, anymore.  Also, the search feature is very robust.  You can bring in a whole bunch of different sources into one search instance to be indexed.  Mind you, there are two different sharepoint products.  On-prem, and Online.  They have very similar, but different feature sets.  Sharepoint isn't a ""install this and get 20% more productivity"" kind of program, like email was.  SharePoint you need 100% more work at the beginning to save 1000% later on.    It's a big change to how things are done.  Everybody needs to be on-board, since the change management is huge with it.  Needs lots of input and direction up front to build it to where it needs to be.  That said, SharePoint has its quirks, and if you don't have anybody in the organization that understands how to utilize it properly, you're gonna have a bad time.  It's gotten much easier, though, as time goes on.  SharePoint is definitely worth it, though.  You'd be surprised how often somebody will come to you with a problem and you'll be all ""you know, I can do that in sharepoint.""    That said, if you only need it for documentation, it might be overkill.  There are better wiki solutions out there.  For example- in my personal life, I pay seven bucks a month for a sharepoint online subscription and I get a TB of cloud storage in onedrive for business, and I set up site collections for a whole slew of different things.  Like gaming.  I put character sheets, PDFs of D&D books I own, campaign notes, etc in there.  All in one place.  And the other guys can access it.  I have script samples of projects i've done in another place.  Professional stuff. I can drag and drop files into that site and then they're accessible online from anywhere.  Sorry I'm rambling.  Just got back from a long drive.  I can run through more stuff with you if you want.  PM me."

If that's the case, yes you can do it.   You'll have to look by pulling the plate off the wall and looking at the wire behind the plate.   If you don't have Cat5 or higher as the phone wire, you're gonna have to use a powerline connection, a wireless connection or a wired to wireless adapter. If you're worried about speed, you need to get a better router. 802.11ac devices will now achieve Gigabit wireless. Look at some of the TP-Link Archer series. Great stuff. If you have a device that doesn't have wireless capability and that's why you need the wire, a USB wireless card is cheap, and a Wireless to wired device would work as well.

A list of fancy certs on your resume might look good to some interviewer who has no experience in IT, but an actual staffer knows that you don't get a feel for troubleshooting and that sense of intuition by burying your nose in books and testing well. If they're serious about certifications they'll help you get those after you're hired - Maybe even pay for them.

They reinstall all those downloads on the new computer, and bam you got malware.  PC Optimizer pro is one of the most common pieces of malware I see today, It is not preloaded on machines. The coupon scanner as well, Doesnt come preloaded.   Dell preloads with things like Dell Datasafe, Dell Safedock, Etc. They almost always put dell in the name.   Customer is lying to you. I would snag a small program called ""Last Activity Viewer"" http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/computer_activity_view.html  This will allow you to see every little thing that was clicked on and run since the computer has had life.

I hunt and peck and the only comments I've had are about how fast I type.  During middle school we all used Mavis Becon which sounds exactly what you're asking for. Lessons were interactive, there were some basic games and what have you.  Side note: check out a PC game called ""Typing of the Dead"" if you're looking for practice. It's a light gun arcade game with the light gun aspect replaced with typing practice. I think speed and accuracy are measured rather than form, though."

I sympathize with you.  Typing of the Dead is a fantastic game and definitely helped me improve my speed in a fun way - BUT you need to be careful with your technique. It becomes really easy to just revert back to your comfort zone to increase your score instead of practicing proper typing. If you're looking for a way to improve your technique without as many distractions there is an open source command line utility that I used to learn DVORAK layout, it has many lessons for all sorts of layouts and difficulty levels.

Being around 8 and before ""keyboarding"" became a class, I adopted my own method of typing.  It started as typical hunt and peck but as I mastered the keyboard it picked up. I went from using both pointers to using pointer and middle then the first 3 on each hand to eventually whole hand.

Any way, I decided that Facebook and reddit would be a good waste of a few minutes before I get up. So an hour later I drag myself out of bed and have a shower, thinking I'm doing well and might actually be able to get off to work by 0800 and get in on time.  Then I go to wake up my 4 year old daughter....  She definitely has daddy all figured out. After fifteen minutes I finally just stand her up, hold underneath her arms and make her zombie walk to the bathroom and get her cleaned up (at the better end of toilet training...), then in to the kitchen for breakfast. Nope, doesn't want a banana and sultanas, has to be cornflakes. Which she eats two mouthfuls of.  So I finally get her to day care at 0830.   Then my 1 hour/90 km trip to work. This wasn't so bad, I got to finish listening to my very favourite pod cast Risky Business (very entertaining infosec podcast, and the host is an Aussie even!). Then on to Paul's Security Weekly, once again very entertaining.   Get to the town I work in, coffee, the hot chick isn't working but at least the very manly gay guy is there to make me feel loved (I'm not gay, just an attention whore).  Coffee is better than usual as the owner is back on the machine.  First onsite visit at 1000, install outlook and make MYOB work with it, no dramas except you have to have outlook open or it makes you select a profile. Meh. Customer is ok with that. Half an hour later, back to the workshop for some shit talking and setting up a wireless doorbell to summon me to the retail showroom when they get busy (I have more hats than a Team Fortress giveaway weekend).  Some good news arrives at about 1100, the new 42RU rack for a customer arrives, along with the 2200 VA UPS, cables and 2 switches (48 and 24 port HP 1820s is you must know). So we start planning the rollout for this week while it's still school holidays.  This about gets me through to covering lunch breaks for the retail showroom (1 guy off sick, boss is on holidays. Woot.). That's a barrel of laughs. Ah well reddit time, and time to check the ScreenConnect deployment to see if the MSI deployed over the weekend. Apparently nobody reboots their computers around here.  Then I go to replace the LCD clamshell on a customers MacBook. Remove clamshell, open new part.... Heywaitaminute. This is a top case AND it has another company's sticker on it. Ah well, I wanted to waste a half hour chatting to Apple any way (it's not that bad, so much better than any other vendors).  Waste some more time talking shit about PITA (https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/radioexp/ SDR is apparently my new hobby).  And then to finish, 4 hours drive to the state capital city to stay overnight in a motel for 3 hours training in the morning and another 4 hours return drive straight home for an early knock off and a game of netball.  Lucky I don't mind Melbourne, even if I will have to walk 15 minutes in the rain tomorrow.   EDIT: turns out they're doing night time tram line work outside my motel. Yaaaaayyyy!!!"

Know that they called you back, so they're interested in learning more about you. Take this time to get to know them, too by asking  questions like ""describe the workflow in a typical day here"" etc. If at the end of the interview they're sounding vague about moving you forward in the process, you could ask ""do you have any hesitance about my qualifications"" giving you a chance to clear up those doubts.   If you have any specific questions, let us know! Congrats on the interview, it's always a good feeling knowing your resume was actually read by a real person. Good luck to you."
computertechs,3c8bkf,Reverend_Veritas,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:30:54 2015 UTC,"I once screwed myself out of a dream job that would have started me out at 50-60/hr when I placed a close 2nd rather than 1st because of one question, and you may run into something similar.  The interviewer asked if there was a system problem that was causing shipping/receiving delays and at the same time the boss had a presentation he had to get to but had trouble accessing a file in his email, then which would you address first. Not having any knowledge apart from that to go off of, like the personality of the boss and if he was more keen on his employees catering to his needs, or how important this presentation was to him and the company in general, I went with helping the boss as I assumed his email attachment problem would be simple enough to resolve quickly before moving on to the other.  However, the answer they were looking for was to ask the boss if his issue was critical as he'd be more concerned that shipping/receiving was going smoothly because that's where the cash flow was.  Years later and I'm still kicking myself over missing out on that opportunity. A costly lesson in asking people to be more f'ing specific because there are way too many variables to consider FFS."
computertechs,3c8bkf,aleinss,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:33:52 2015 UTC,So basically they gave you a Kobayashi Maru.  I would go fix shipping and receiving first since affects the company's bottom line.  Your boss should have planned better.
computertechs,3c8bkf,Reverend_Veritas,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:17:52 2015 UTC,"And I would have gone with that if I didn't expect the boss to be a selfish jerkoff who expects to be brown-nosed in that particular hypothetical situation. Like I said, there are more variables to consider than I was given by the interviewer, and the information I was given wasn't sufficient to make a real-world decision.  I think I even asked the guy who interviewed me what the document was and how important it was to have, but it sounded like he didn't even anticipate those kinds of in-depth questions before hand and didn't really have a response.  They could have ranged anywhere from trivial photo attachments to critical spreadsheets for a shareholder meeting which would have made the boss and subsequently the company lose face. My mind is too analytical for vague scenarios, so I defaulted to ass-kissing the boss rather than thinking I'd have to appease him like a tantrum-throwing child by saying the warehouse needs to run smoothly to make him money.  In short, people piss me off."

It, like the GE Geek toolkit, has many tools all in one location, but it enables helpful things like automation, work/scan logging and reporting, ability to easily add your own tools / download tools from others, etc. It also has updating via Ketarin, so all your tools are kept fresh. It has become a total staple in my computer repair workflow.  Next to that, Fab's Autobackup is very helpful for grabbing personal data from a machine before re-installing an operating system. However, if there are many files, you will need a large thumb drive/external hard drive to hold it all.

computertechs,3c0m09,_LeggoMyEggo_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:26:00 2015 UTC,RepairTech is based on an old version of D7 (not D7II).  I assume they got the full code for it and were free to update it but I'm guessing at that.  I've been generally impressed with UVK (especially since I'd written it off a couple of years ago as a strictly antimalware tool) because of its ability to incorporate VBS/CMD/AutoIt scripts within its own scripts.  That gives it a lot of versatility and it's priced at a one-time $50 so that's pretty hard to beat.
computertechs,3c0m09,Mon_arch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:37:38 2015 UTC,"With repair tech you are paying for their online ticketing service more than the tools.

I hope this doesn't come off as too harsh, I like the path you are taking but a few changes could make the video much more engaging.    The main critique is that it is too slow.  You have lots of long pauses that can be edited down quite a bit and make it better.  You could probably shave 30 seconds off without trying very hard, and with a little script editing you can probably get it down to 1 minute!   0:00 - 0:10 Intro animation.  Could be trimmed down to 2-3 seconds, or move logo animation to end.  Seriously, I know you want to build brand recognition and 10 seconds doesn't seem long, but viewers don't care about intro animations and they will be frustrated by longer ones (which yours is). You don't want your logo associated with frustration.  0:27  You finally start talking about the problem of dust and heat.  You will lose viewers because it has taken almost 30 seconds to just introduce the point of the video. That is almost an entire TV commercial before they even know what you are getting at! You can basically start the video right here and have people engaged from the first moment.   1:00 - 1:18 Consequences of dust and heat.  This part is good, very informative, but could still be edited down a bit.  Lots of dead air in this part.   1:23 - 1:41  Your solution.  Not bad.  The script could still be edited to a more concise form though.   1:41 - 1:46 Benefit to clients.  This is one area I think you should emphasize with a little more time.  This is the end result that is all the client really will understand.   1:46 - 1:55 Closing call to action.   More dead air in this one, and it doesn't come off as a strong call to action.  It is like you are meekly asking them in a shy way to come to your shop.  A good call to action will be more like an order.  ""So come down today and get your laptop ready for the heat,"" instead of, ""So... please... bring your laptop to me.""   TL:DR You want a concise video that gets to the point, keeps your viewer engaged, and ends strong.  Right now you have a great concept, but it takes awhile to get to the point, dead air will lose interest, and the ending is not as strong as it could be.    Here is a good example of a short intro, getting right to the point, and editing out the dead air.   MKBHD is a reviewer, so he doesn't have call to action at the end of his videos, so here is a quick video on how to close well."

Where you are going is good but honestly the audio was so bad and it took so long to get to the point I stopped watching at just after 30 second in. I then went back and watched it without audio.   If you are going to have a logo intro it has to be quicker or more entertaining. The animation out for the logo I saw as pointless and just took up more time. I get the point of the image of the inside of the laptop but it really doesn't fit in with the rest of the ad. If you had an animated projector and screen with the image on it that may be better? The laptop images need to have the black background removed it detracts from what they are. The text banners need to be looked at. Yes you want them noticed but the white I feel is to stark and make it look cheaply done. It's too long. You need to find a way to shorten the length of it   The animations are great and I love the colors used.

computertechs,3bsnds,shitty_admin,8,Thu Jul 2 13:25:22 2015 UTC,"I would have to ask how you tried virtualization because that is the best answer in my experience. You will need to replace the hardware eventually best to do so as soon as possible. Getting new hardware is problematic for XP unless you virtualize.    Buying old hardware to keep the OS going is just throwing money away and is a plan that has no path to upgrade, eventually becoming unsupportable. This is not a place you want to be with your client.   Think of this way, the cost to replace those machines could be 10 times as much as it would to get proper licensing and hardware to support virtualization. This is also how I sold the client on the idea of virtualization.   In the past I had very similar situation.   I had a client that made cabinets and had similar, very expensive machines that were controlled by XP and NT boxes. They were old and failing so we went in and replaced the hardware with new. Then we vsphere essentials licensing for our hosts; each host hosted a single VM running XP or NT depending on the machine. I was actually able to P2V the some of older workstations right into the new VM hosts. Works still to this day and even tho each vm host license cost 500 dollars a piece(at the time) plus the cost of new hardware , installation, configuration we saved the client hundreds of thousands of dollars in replacement of the machining equipment. Plus earned a client for life as my former company still supports their environment today.   Edit: Also would suggest become a vmware partner. Lots of benefits and tools will be made available to you after you do and it is easier to learn."

computertechs,3bsnds,WestsideStorybro,3,Wed Jul 1 22:56:46 2015 UTC,"Well it was 500 for the vsphere essential license per host/CPU. No os cost as we reused previous keys and migrated physical machines to virtual when possible. (p2v). Hardware was fairly cheap. Mid level HPs workstation  The important part is that they are new, under warranty and are not consumer models but business class machines. This created supportable environment with clear upgrade path. Then you also have to consider installation and configuration costs. All said and done the client put up 15000 dollars for everything he needed. To replace one machine would have cost more than a hundred thousand dollars not counting upgrade and conversion costs for their old software which contained all their custom templates for woodworking cabinets. We did this for 10 machines so about 1500 a workstation installed and configured.  Once you are licensed you can leverage VMware support to get you started and troubleshoot issues like lag.  What will cost your client is something you have to find out through a discovery process.  This was also billed to the client but separately and with the understanding that they didn't have to accept my proposal but they still had to pay me for the research.   edited some words"

Raid1 mirrors the data on the 4tbs to each other in case one fails. In that event you plug in a new drive and tell the raid to rebuild.  The SSD will be on its own with the operating system on it.  I'd pull one drive and do a clone before scanning, at least then you have a copy of the data. Worst case then you can stick in 2 new 4tb drives, configure as raid1 and clone the data back should shit be hitting any fans.  I'd be surprised that the RAID wasn't giving error messages if it was the 4tbs though. What's it doing, bluescreens?"
computertechs,3bsrrz,crayne,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:32:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no question about where the OS was located, just which of the three drives was failing. The customer said that the computer would lock up when he was accessing the media drive (the RAID'd 4 TBs). Turns out it just locks up within about five minutes regardless. Eventually it will go to the blue screen and spit out a critical_process_failure code. /sfc scannow didn't fix the issue and I'm suspecting (because the desktop locks up) that the SSD is suddenly dismounting. If it was HDDs, I'd either not be able to load the OS at all due to mounting error, or the computer would be fine except for when I try to access the dirty drive, since it is just storage and doesn't house any Windows files. Generally. But since this is the first time I've handled a RAID configured computer I don't know what kind of curveballs those add.  Like I said, I suspect the HDD because every SSD I've had waltz in the doors has done this, but I need to be certain that the HDDs in the RAID don't have any bad sectors before I call guy up and tell him it's time to make his wallet cry. Though, I guess a new 4 TB HDD is around the price of a smaller SSD these days.  EDIT: forgot to mention that a crash report is not present when the OS reloads, which gives more weight to my ""randomly ejecting SSD"" theory. But still, for the sake of a thorough diagnostic, I want to make sure these HDDs in the RAID aren't also bad/the RAID is still healthy because I've read that sudden shutoffs can screw up the mirrors in RAID 1."

First, backup the data if possible. Then I'd suggest updating the Intel RST software and of course the firmware/bios to the latest versions. Then, Use the startup Intel RAID configuration to pull the RAID1 apart. You can then independently scan both disks using regular methods.

A proper backup is something that is kept offsite, separate from the computer, and preferably offline.

computertechs,3bnnqy,averypoliteredditor,2,Tue Jun 30 20:27:29 2015 UTC,"Teamviewer is probably going to be the cheapest to license. It is sufficient for what you're trying to do. It's not the best, most mature product, but it will work and you should be able to afford it.  As far as preventing people from not paying, I don't think you will encounter this issue often. Most people are not going to treat you that way.  That being said, it is a possibility. Personally, I would just take my chances. I would collect as much information about the client as possible (name, address, driver license #, etc.) so I could pursue legal action if I really wanted to, but chances are I'm not going to take someone to court for <~$200 of services.  If you're worried about losing any money, then require payment up front and offer refunds (refunds cost YOU money) if they are unsatisfied with the service. <-- This is how big corporations that sell remote support do it.  Really, it all comes down to how much of your time you're willing to risk. Your time is money. Therefore, if someone wastes your time, they are costing you money. But if you go to court for $200, and spend a couple thousand in the process (even if you recoup legal fees) you have expended more time. Just some perspective...  EDIT: Quickbooks... you send someone an invoice and enable an option for them to pay with credit/debit. They pay via Quickbooks. Not sure if QB is itself processes the payment or just hosts the portal, but they facilitate the whole process. They have a little card reader for your phone if you're in the field. I only offer it if there is no other payment option. It costs money to use their payment services. I'd rather take a dozen checks to the bank before I give QB a dime for its payment processing services."

computertechs,3bks7h,themogul504,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:39:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying. So, I am aware of the tests proving that, generally, SSDs are pretty reliable (now-a-days). The referenced article actually focuses on the Enterprise.   Enterprise SSDs are fantastic. SSDs in my datacenter all day/every day (however, in that instance, even if multiple drives went down I wouldn't lose anything because of built-in redundancy and good backup policies-- hell, it shouldn't even be noticeable to anyone not in the IT department).  Consumer SSDs, however, can vary in quality and reliability. I've seen a few cases where Samsung 840 drives (pretty highly ranked in most testing) were bricked after abrupt power loss over the last few years.   Say the OP puts two shitty SSDs in RAID 0 and one day one of them bricks-- what recourse does the average consumer have? none, probably. They most likely don't backup regularly, and good luck recovering data from a bad SSD.  tl;dr this doesn't sound like an enterprise question, so answering as if it is going to be enterprise-grade hardware (with data further secured by a good backup policy) isn't what I did.  Also, thanks for clarifying what you actually disagreed with (and I'm assuming the rest of the down-voters disagreed with)."

If someone says otherwise than they typically don't know what they are talking about or are trying to sell you something.   Certs can help articulate your experience and help set you apart from others, but for the most part they are just a piece of paper. What you do with the information you gained while studying for the cert is more important than getting it. Yes some jobs ""require"" certain certs,  it that is more for the companies well being and sometimes because HR doesn't know better. One of the reason CEH is seen as a more valuable cert than OSCP instead of the other way around."
computertechs,3bhnsp,OSUTechie,2,Mon Jun 29 10:04:25 2015 UTC,This - After ten plus years of experience the only certs I will seek are the ones I am obligated to maintain for partnership agreements or what have you. At the moment I have none that I need to renew. still buy the books though. It is good to review and refresh from time to time.
computertechs,3bhnsp,WestsideStorybro,-1,Mon Jun 29 20:23:45 2015 UTC,"Of course experience trumps certs. But how do you get a job managing Citrix servers unless you have certs? How do you get a job as a network technician or engineer without the certs? You could work your way up from the bottom, working that entry level job and moving from one project to another until you work your way up.  I finished a 1 year tech course at a community college (accelerated 2 years compressed into 1 year). 12 people in the class. I'm the only one that got my certs (approx 10, stuff like A+, Network+, MCSA, MCITP, VCP, etc).   Everybody else in the class got jobs like help desk or service desk. I literally doubled their salary and got a job in a Fortune 1000 company. In fact, people in my position in this company have at min. 3 years experience, whereas i'm fresh out of school.  So yes, experience trumps certs. But if you have no experience in SANs and you want to get into SANs (one of THE hottest technologies atm), how do you get into it? By certs.  My experience from people who disregard certs are people who are stuck in their job. These people work the same positions for a decade and have no vertical movement at all. Good luck making $150K+/yr or even $100K/yr with no certs. I have a goal to make $100K in 5 years (at this pace i'll probably do it in 2-3) and $150K+ in 10, and there's no doing it without certs."

But if you want to get into networking and you have no networking experience, then you need certs. The OP went from a level 1 PC tech to Citrix Admin in 3.5 years, try doing that without certs. Would they have let him touched anything close to the Citrix servers if he didn't have any certs? Hell no.  And no, it was not luck. That's my entire point. You can rely on luck to get you to where you want to be, hoping that projects will open up and your boss or somebody higher up will let you touch and learn the technology... or you can learn the technology, then get the certs to prove you've learned it.  I didn't rely on luck. I knew i wanted to work with Microsoft products, so i got my MCSA and MCITP. I knew everything was being virtualized, so i got my VCP. And i knew that ITIL was very important in this area i'm in, so i got ITIL. 6 months later and half my class are still looking for jobs. Those who got jobs got mostly call center or help desk type positions.   I would have never got the position i'm in without my certs. Zero chance they would let anyone touch the servers or vSphere without experience. But I got the position, why? Because of my certs, they proved that I knew the technologies. I went from service desk to intermediate systems analyst in 1 year. I also keep in touch with my old service desk team via LinkedIn, and you know what, they're all still doing the same stuff. Maybe in different companies, but still the same stuff. I'm on a completely different career trajectory, and it's entirely due to my certs."

So some of us are not as ""aggressive"" as you are, or have disposable income to spend on a shit load of certs at once. I feel like you think I am trying to devalue your certs. I'm not, but don't hold them on a pedestal. They are just paper that quantify your knowledge. But they are not the end-all-to-end-all. As for all your friends are who still stuck ""doing the same stuff."" Who gives a rats ass, maybe they like doing what they are doing. Maybe they have different career goals. Big whoop. Stop comparing yourself to them to make you feel better.  Again, I'm not saying certs are bad. They won't hurt you. They will help set you apart from other candidates.

During that time I've also run the IT department of a dotcom, but it's less interesting although better paying, more stable work. In that role, I was also hiring others: certifications - for me - go in the bin. Sit down and talk - I'll very quickly work out if you are up for it, as previous bosses were good enough to do both for me and others. That said, HR (cursed be their name) have absolutely no idea whatsoever so do look at certifications as they need some method of cutting down the list.   Thus, certifications are of use when the applicant is wanting to be a cog in the wheel of some larger organisation. Someone looking to join a smaller outfit has less, even no, need for them."

I can't say the cert itself helped me do what I do, it was literally a requirement and I basically walked in and almost aced the exam just from practical knowledge.  Has it helped? Well I'm very competent with Macs, which somewhat helps with Linux as the terminology/commands/ideas are somewhat familiar once you know one well enough.   The cert just clarified what I knew and helped me to be 100% confident what I was doing was the correct way of doing things, so really it's just a nice thing to add to the resume and helps the confidence a little, but necessary? Absolutely not. I learned everything I learned by self teaching myself, not by reading books, books helped me with theory, which in some cases can help you troubleshoot better, but nothing you can't learn from out and out experience.   I run a business obviously (that's why I'm in this sub!) and I could not care less what certs a perspective employee had, but IF they had certs on the resume and I had yet to speak to them, I'd be more likely to interview them because they've shown enough of an interest in the field. It's hard to tell from the ""I fix computers"" crowd from actual knowledgeable techs, so places they've worked first, how they speak second (it's easy to tell if someone knows their stuff) and as certs come third."

computertechs,3bhnsp,pjrcscomp,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:15:57 2015 UTC,"As everyone has said, experience will be key. Certifications are good for moving into a field where you lack solid experience, but those who show they have made it in a real environment, are going to be valued more than someone who passed several exams.  Some high level certs are extremely valuable, more than many years experience, such as Cisco's highest level certifications (CCIE), with only 3% of all Cisco professionals holding a CCIE, and less than 1% of all networking professionals. Holding a CCIE really is an accomplishment that, on its own, can get you some jobs instantly.  Of the certifications you're currently set out for, given your current certifications, CCNA would probably give you the highest marginal advantage. I personally probably wouldn't dig into server 2k12, CCE-V, or VMware since you already have a lot to show for that knowledge.

Even with a dead backlight, you can see text/an image on the screen if using strong overhead lights or a flashlight. So if I have a dead screen, I'm checking to make sure the laptop powers-on (lights, fan, HDD), check brightness settings, shine a light on the display, check with external display.  If all the preceding are negative, it's bad power.  If all but the Power is negative, it's a bad MoBo.  If it were a bad CPU, I would expect to see at least a POST or hear a beep code.  I've only come across one bad CPU- on a desktop. I would also ask the customer if they saw any corrupted video, such as horizontal bars or multi-colored static (indicating bad video). There is always a chance you are wrong, but you want to make a best effort to diagnose.  You could have 2 or more failed components, which you may only find after replacing at least one component.  I wouldn't fault a tech for not catching a bad memory stick if the MoBo was also confirmed bad.  I would have a problem if they didn't catch the backlight or inverter was bad instead of the MoBo."

The fact that it didn't give a beep code or LED diagnostic pattern when all the RAM was out is fairly conclusive. The CPU remains unknown without a known-good swap available but it's pretty unlikely, and may not be changeable anyway, depending on the laptop model."

Interesting you mention no beep codes without RAM, something I didn't think of but makes sense, it did nothing differently without RAM which should be a sign in itself.   The other reason I don't like changing CPU's is on some laptops it's a case of disassembling the entire thing piece by piece, which in some old laptops will have rusted clips, etc, not to mention takes a fair while. It's a risk for a very, very low chance of a fix, and even then, probably an expensive fix for a 4 year old AMD low end laptop, which wouldn't be worth doing even if I was dead set on replacing the CPU."

computertechs,3bgynn,No1Asked4MyOpinion,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:41:31 2015 UTC,"e for thinking quite ahead. You have a smartphone right? Got internet? Carry the charging cable religiously or in your car? Just use the internet to download any such driver when you need it (drivers typically aren't more than 20MBs) and transfer file to computer? Good on yo   The idea of this one is to have one driver CD (on a DVD which I throw in my cd case full of other stuff) that covers all drivers, so things like sound cards, lan cards, wi-fi, even graphics drivers for a lot of stuff. The idea is for those situations when I'm offline and really need a driver for what ever reason. It's more of a ""good to have"" then need to have.   I seriously never thought of downloading drivers directly on my smartphone, great idea! I do always carry a cable, car charger, cable, etc. Only thing is my Internet plan here in Australia for my phone is a little sucky, for the last 2-3 years I've only had 2.5GB per month but I managed to get in a good deal which now gives me 6GB, so it's definitely possible to use my phone now for hundred meg downloads when needed.   Thanks, I'm learning a lot of useful things from this sub, you guys are a god send!   http://drp.su/ This is the website for the ISO, it's pretty useful, scans a PC, checks for outdated drivers and updates them, with full manual control. But useful for straight after I do a re-install to get all drivers to an acceptable state, but I generally just do ethernet and let Windows Update do the rest."
computertechs,3bgynn,No1Asked4MyOpinion,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:19:56 2015 UTC,"Good idea, since it's only a few hundred MB, I'll have plenty of space to throw it on my main 32GB USB where I put 99% of my tools, so this will be super useful. Thanks, I never thought to look for it in packs, so I'll grab a good LAN and WLAN pack, that'll cover most of what I need and Windows Update can sort out the rest."

The problem is, you just had windows write a bunch of info all over the drive.  When files are deleted they arent actually deleted, just not longer indexed or referenced are and pretty much treated as writeable space for new data.  Also, windows + L is your friend.

Even elevating CMD to root requires you to actually tell it to open with root.  It's fine that you're here but next time ask over in /r/techsupport for recovery options BEFORE you wipe.

Recovery is a snap (I managed to haul down ~1TB of data over the course of a day mostly painlessly).   I use robocopy to mirror my data disk to an external HDD every week or so (robocopy is incremental, so each backup is ~10 minutes) and use backblaze as a differential restore to bring back everything since my last HDD mirroring (usually no more than a couple gigs on a busy week).  This setup has gotten me through three catastrophic failures just fine (including one with a dual HDD failure where I had to pull ALL my data off Backblaze, which wasn't horrible)."

I use it to backup 2TB~ of data and it runs fairly quickly, we use it at work to backup individual workstations (i.e. Finance machines) which then just gets sent up to our main Veeam backup repository over the network. It uses change block tracking so the first one is always long but after that it's fairly speedy and recovery is a breeze."

It gives you the ability to create recovery media (USB/ISO) so you could do a bare-metal restore if your disks or machine packed up. For example, I backup my entire system including OS with restore points for the last 14 days. I could restore my entire machine to one of those days or just recover specific files from one of the restore points.  I find it's nice that it runs in the background and throttles the backup job when it detects the PC is in use.   I also like that the restore points are all compressed, whether you find it better/worse than robocopy is up to you :)"

Don't care for QOS? With the new Fast Track features you can expect over 1Gbps routed throughput. The 2.4ghz wireless on this thing is also so powerful, it won't technically be legal until you turn it down to regulatory domain settings. The LCD screen is a lot of fun too.  Additional 2.4GHZ AP's - hAP lite, ($18.95) these little guys are powerful for such a small, power-efficient device. 2-chain 2.4ghz wireless at up to 22dbm. Plus they can be powered via USB.

We really only repair Apple and Samsung phones and iPads.  Anything else is pretty much unnecessarily time consuming and not profitable.  That being said, we charge $120 USD for iPad 2-4 and $150 USD for iPad Air and iPad Mini.  Generally the screens are less than $30 each and the repair takes about 30-45 minutes depending on the severity of the screen break.  The heat plate we bought was less than $200 and it is big enough to fit an iPad on the element.  Without iPad and iPhone repair, we'd not have survived the 6 and a half years we've been in business.

When I first did a complete teardown of a laptop, it took me almost two hours and I don't think everything made it back in the system, it was frustrating. After doing hundreds of laptops, I eventually could replace virtually every part in less than 30 minutes for most makes/models.  The same kind of thing happened with tablets. I bricked two tablets in the learning process (I blame it on the cheap manufacturer) but eventually, I mastered the practice. Just don't sweat it, especially if you're paid by the hour.  If you have large hands, invest in quality tiny pliers/tweezers, and prying tools. Magnetizing your screwdrivers is a must. I wear surgical gloves, not sure if they make a huge difference.

I also do not bargain on price, I'm more than happy for a customer to go to the mall types if they just want the cheapest repair. I've found if you stuff up a single thing, boom, you've lost all profit on the repair and you just stress for nothing.   Eventually I've done so many phones/tablets now that it becomes a lot easier, but unlike computer, if I want to work on a few phone repairs, they have to be my sole focus for the duration of the repair.

Place a pick at each corner once you pass it to keep the glass from reattaching. Maybe ten-fifteen minutes for the full glass removal.  Bossman gets a particular kind of guitar pick which is thin but doesn't melt with our heat gun. I don't really know what the properties of it are since I don't really guitar.

Has a virus scan been ran? Any particular processes eating up CPU or RAM? What Antivirus is running (I have had a similar issue with Kaspersky)
computertechs,3b100x,ManyInterests,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:51:34 2015 UTC,"Take a look at the services and processes running in the standard user versus the administrator.  Some processes or services may only be available to the administrator; processes/services that are affecting performance.  You can also try copying the local GPOs from the admin account and apply them to the standard user if that fits your environment requirements...  You may have also inadvertently caused a scenario where Windows is now attempting to index the new user folders. If there's a lot of data in the user account, the indexing service can cause performance issues while it indexes. The admin account wouldn't experience issues since there's not a lot to index or it's already indexed. This is a possibility.  Open resource monitor on the standard account and see what is going on. You can usually pinpoint a particular item hogging resources through resource monitor."

If you are testing HP's or other branded systems they can use up too much of the initial system memory with their customised BIOS's causing a ""Program too big to fit in memory"" error when you boot them from the network, you also get that error if too much stuff is enabled (Storage SCU stuff usually kills network boot for me) sticking it on a USB stick test is the only fix for that.  We test on a wide range of hardware, sometimes quite specialised and PC-Check always ends up testing them ok, even if it does need some fiddling with."

These feel more like tests than just simple benchmarking tools. They test more than what I've seen on Hiren's too, tests areas of the motherboard etc.  It also lets you create reports for your customers so they can see what you actually did. PCDR lets you slap your brand all over it too so it looks professional.   This lists all of the different tests it can run."

computertechs,3awm1d,Codeworks,10,Wed Jun 24 20:46:45 2015 UTC,I wouldn't rule out Linux entirely.  There are some distros that are pretty straight forward simple to use.   Elementary OS as an example: http://elementary.io/
computertechs,3awm1d,ajeoae,3,Wed Jun 24 03:40:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I think a lot of people out there would be willing to buy a cheap ""beater"" computer, especially a laptop, running a barebones Linux distro, as long as they are in good working order. They won't sell for a lot or anything, but they would be perfect for a child, someone on-the-go and on a budget, CS or EE students, really just anyone who needs a cheap-ass computer that they can run into the ground."
computertechs,3awm1d,fuzzyfractal42,3,Wed Jun 24 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"Definitely...you can basically build netbook feeling PC out of old hardware that actually functions quite smoothly!  I set up Elementary for a non profit a few years ago...set up their dock with the stuff they'd need (replaced Midori with Opera for a slightly more functional browser, installed LibreOffice, and replaced the default email client with Thunderbird).   It's been awhile now...the thing is keeping itself up to date and I've had zero support calls for it...they love it."
computertechs,3awm1d,ajeoae,3,Wed Jun 24 22:17:01 2015 UTC,That's awesome and it's so good to hear that old computers can have new life breathed into them with a little Linux and a little love. :)
computertechs,3awm1d,fuzzyfractal42,2,Thu Jun 25 15:08:48 2015 UTC,But old XP machines may be better suited to something like Lubuntu
computertechs,3awm1d,UniversalSuperBox,3,Wed Jun 24 04:29:43 2015 UTC,"Really depends on how old they are.   Elementary is built on top of Ubuntu...I only recommended it because it is a very approachable disto and a way to find new owners who are not used to Linux...Zorin (http://zorin-os.com) would come in second, then Mint (http://linuxmint.com).   If tinkering, other distros would fit....Lubuntu is decent tho, just wouldn't be a first pick for Novices to me"
computertechs,3awm1d,ajeoae,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:40:47 2015 UTC,Mint is pretty small as well if I recall correctly.
computertechs,3awm1d,JonnyLay,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"It definitely can be.  Mint actually comes in a few flavors (no pun intended) with different Desktop Environments.  The best to use can be somewhat subjective, but the Mate version is fairly stable and easy to navigate in my opinion.  Cinnamon is also pretty decent, and is built on top of Gnome 3 vs Mate's Gnome 2.  There's also a KDE edition which has all the benefits of KDE (but a little weighty for a slow PC).  The smallest, most compact version of Mint is the XFCE edition....pretty much the Mint equivalent of Lubuntu."
computertechs,3awm1d,ajeoae,4,Wed Jun 24 22:11:04 2015 UTC,"Is it really worth your time to try to sell any of these? Given how old these computers are with outdated XP, should you really sell them to a client? Really, walmart has extremely cheap computer that your client will be so much better off. You could get cheap computers from arrowtech (or what ever its called now) and sell a much newer product for not that much more.    E-recycle. The place I take it too will try to donate the better working ones.  Try to reclaim the gold yourself. You will need a metric ton to get a few grams (I actually really don't suggest this. Nasty acid/chemicals and a lot of work.) Give it to ppl that want to open up/work on it. To learn about computers.  Make a data recovery computer out of one (as someone already posted). It will require SATA connection or cards. Look into ddrescue. You can make good easy money with data recovery. Really. Its like 5 min to set up and you can charge a few hrs labor time. We got back data almost every time we tried on a disk that spinned up. No need to send it to drivesavers.  Save a few for repairs. You might need it someday. But it is really getting to the point that XP repairs are at not worth it."

I put them back up on eBay for $100-$150 and they fly off the shelves.   Everything I do starts with a sysprep image, so the most I need is to install drivers.

Open the machine and examine what is installed or run CPUz to determine memory type. Based on what I have, decide wether to just add or change out to a new pair of sticks. Price out RAM from Amazon, Newegg, Crucial or eBay. Buy and install.   Are you matching speeds or checking to see if the board will only support a certain type?

computertechs,3aw9v0,mattyparanoid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:25:15 2015 UTC,I am doing mid-cycle tech refreshes on working machines in a busy company so I do clone the drives over when I upgrade a machine from HDD to SSD.  I almost never have an issue and have done ~50 of our machines so far. I have encounted a few that I had to use different software and I think one that just wouldn't clone but that is only say 3 out of 50 that were problematic.  Started this upgrade program to SSD about 2 years ago and the users absolutely love it when they get their machine back. I am doing the upgrade in conjunction with a RAM upgrade as well so they go from 4-8GB of RAM and from HDD to SSD. I call it the one-two punch (or triple if I install a new graphics card on a desktop).  Spending about $100-150 a machine and it is making them really fast.

A couple of questions, if I may.  1) Are you using Clonzilla, or some other software? 2) In Australia, that's like $300 :P Everything tech is so much more expensive here. What size SSD do you usually recommend? I normally see how much space they're using on their C: Drive and get something to cover that much, the cost to GB ratio is a bit of a problem on laptops with one drive bay."
computertechs,3aw9v0,mattyparanoid,2,Fri Jun 26 12:24:24 2015 UTC,"I have been sticking to the Samsung EVO 840 and 850 line. They come with Samsung Data Migration. It is the most dead simple, fast cloner I have ever used. If I buy a different SSD I have used easeus todo backup. We are a business so I can regulate disk usage by forcing users to use our network shares for files. As such I can buy relatively modest size SSDs.    I work in 3 tiers. Top tier guys like VP and department heads will get 250GB or 500GB drives (but only for ego purposes, they don't use any more space than the next tier). These will always be Samsung 840 or 850.  Middle tier folks get 128GB drives, maybe 250GB but not often. Most of these are Samsung with a few Sandisk or Kingston.  Low tier machines are usually for machine control or infrequent use and I just get the cheapest I can find, typically 64GB-120GB. I make sure I get a decent brand with good reviews out on the internet but cost is the over-riding factor.  I budgeted for $150 average per machine for this upgrade. I have been hitting the mark well and my financials for all 5 months so far this year have been on target.  Come to the US. Bring an empty suitcase. Do a bit of sight-seeing, then some shopping. Pack that suitcase full of SSD and RAM. A suitcase could fit a whole bunch of RAM and SSD. I bet someone who wanted to take the time could figure the cost benefit..."

I didn't know the SSD's included cloning software, I'll have to try it out when I get a chance! That makes a lot of sense, makes it a lot easier. On a desktop it's easy, just slap on the biggest they can afford, on a laptop, a lot of the time they can't afford the SSD they actually need.    Oh how tempted I am, so much thing are so much cheaper there, (of course even account for the dollar and taxes), if I get enough volume, I can honestly see a trip to the states being at the very least, a free holiday, haha :D"

The reality is that if this is a small mom & pop grocery store with $30k in profit a year, a $30k POS, inventory and accounting system is probably not at all what they're looking for.   I can't see how a ""cloud based"" system would offer much more functionality than a standard on-site system. I'm sure a cloud based salesman could prove me wrong.   Anyway, I think the point that jfoust12 was trying to get across is if you know so little about the technology that you're having to get advice to give advice and haven't made your own opinion, you might not be the best person to take on consulting. I'm definitely not picking on you, just be careful of which advice you take and why. The old addage; cheaper does not always equal better could apply here.   Now, having said all of that, I actually no nothing about Grocery Store POS systems, so I'm not going to even try to make an educated guess about what you're looking for.

I did not remove any of the infections with it, I just recorded their paths.  Used PE to edit the registry to prevent the executable from launching on boot. I still wanted to clean the PC in safe mode, so I used a system recovery flash drive to force safe mode.  After that, I ran MBAM just to see if it would find the virus. It did.

computertechs,3a2xb1,Jibrish,3,Wed Jun 17 00:26:07 2015 UTC,"Based on this and all your other posts the quickest and best (also on topic) way to go about this is to get a CCNA. You'll learn about networking, a little bit about servers and have a marketable skill with a valuable cert. You can find everything you need training wise for free - esp. if you torrent it. Download packet tracer, download CBT nuggets full CCNA course, go in to take the single test (Don't get a CCENT, it's useless) and be done with it. You can bang the whole thing out in a very devoted 2-3 weeks.  Don't get an A+. It's always recommended in these threads. Don't. That cert is worthless. It doesn't teach you much (What kind of cleaning solution to use on a computer case was on my test..). It doesn't net you much pay and it's multiple tests which are a PiTA.  Get a vendor specific cert that isn't desktop support. I recommended CCNA since you like networking (Also, I have one). But anything server / DB side by Microsoft, any juniper Cert, any Linux cert is also good.  Please avoid A+. For the same time investment (though, harder material) you can shoot for 50-60k+ vs. 12 dollars an hour."

computertechs,39y7qk,timmmmb,0,Mon Jun 15 20:23:10 2015 UTC,There's only one instance I can remember in 6 years and it wasn't the user's fault - rather a waitress.   How is it not the users fault for having their work laptop out in a restaurant?   Personally I'd still call that the users fault.

computertechs,39w4r6,jfoust2,5,Wed Jun 17 03:10:10 2015 UTC,"If you see a national or international news story on your local newscast, chances are your local news station doesn't actually have reporters on-site in Syria or whatever. The footage likely came from the parent network (i.e. NBC). In the old days, NBC would broadcast these stories via private (encrypted) satellite feed, and your local NBC station would have a bunch of VCRs set up to record them. NBC would then email or fax a list of the clips, a news director would look at the list and circle what interested him, and some intern would have to go through all that tape and dump the stories to individual carts (videotapes that only hold 3-4 minutes of video).    I worked for a company that sent digital video via satellite to servers located in newsrooms all over the country. Instead of setting up a bunch of VTRs to tape analog broadcasts, news directors could use a web browser-style interface to preview the videos, and the station could opt to either dump a story to tape or send the MPEG2 version directly to air.  Needless to say, these were important servers. When one broke, it was a big deal. It wasn't uncommon that a busted server would be put on a plane in Omaha in the morning and flown to our headquarters in Atlanta, where it would be fixed and sent back to the airport, and flown back to Omaha in time for the 6 o'clock news.  One station had a particular problem. Our server would crash. It would work fine all day long, but some time after the late shift left but before the morning shift arrived, it would BSOD. We combed the EVTs. We installed in-depth monitoring software. But we couldn't find anything wrong with the server. We sent them a new server, but it started BSODing overnight, too. It was the same disk image we used on servers all over the country, so it couldn't have been software. We sent them a really nice UPS with a line conditioner and everything, thinking power might be an issue. Nope, still BSOD. We were literally pulling our hair out about it. We had senior Microsoft engineers on speed dial, but they couldn't find anything wrong, either.   We decided to do a conference call with the station in hopes of actually ""seeing"" a crash happen. This meant I had to be at work at 4:30 in the morning, since the crashes were happening at around 5:50AM CT. I was absolutely half-asleep during most of the conference call. My boss and my co-worker were actively talking to the guy at the station. But then I heard someone at the station - quietly, in the background - say they were going to power on some piece of equipment. Our server immediately crashed. My boss and co-worker were so busy talking to the station engineer that they missed it. Suddenly wide awake, I asked the guy what they had just powered on. It was a huge satellite dish. I asked him when they turned it on. He said around 5:50 every morning. My boss, who had much more experience in broadcasting than I did, asked him where exactly the dish was. He said on the other side of the wall. My boss said it might be giving off a burst of EMR. He suggested moving the server to the other side of the room. The station did, and the problem went away.  TL;DR: Client had major issue with mission-critical server.

Windows Mail (or whatever it was that came with Windows 7) uses individual .eml files.   I got my parents a new computer for Christmas, and set up Windows Mail to check their ISP account. Despite making sure the ""leave items on server"" box was unchecked, Windows Mail would download every email every time it checked. Duplicates abounded. I didn't put a lot of effort into troubleshooting the issue, because the new computer had WiFi, and my folks were going to drop their ISP and leech off my sister's WiFi instead. So I figured the email account would go away and the problem would fix itself.   My dad texted me this week, asking me to remotely connect to the computer for a couple unrelated issues. While on the phone, he mentioned the Windows Mail issue, and I opened the app. He had 169,537 emails in his inbox, mostly duplicates (sometimes hundreds of duplicates) that Windows Mail had downloaded over and over and over again. I tried deleting the email from within Windows Mail, but it said it was going to take 8+ hours. Since he's moved over to Gmail, I decided to just delete the store using Windows Explorer: it took around 15 minutes to delete all that stuff, because the profile folder had over 175,000 individual items!"

They had a Vista laptop and the issue was the ""Local Only"" network headache that wouldn't allow access to the internet. I had dealt with it before and all it needed was a new driver. I asked the client where their router was, to which he responded ""Oh it's in the attic."" Okay...   I had a 3ft patch cable in my bag and that was it. So I climbed up into the attic with the laptop and cable, plugged in, and attempted to find the driver. Of course it wasn't on the manufacturer's website and I had to search deep in the depths of the internet (AKA I found it on some polish website - it was sketchy as all hell but it was the correct driver) and once I finally got that downloaded and installed it worked without an issue. The client was happy, I was happy, and got a nice bonus for crawling around in a dirty old attic.   I should also mention the next time out there I relocated the router and upgraded the customer to a Win7 machine. Never again.

computertechs,39w4r6,tunaman808,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:40:46 2015 UTC,"Another, non-specific, one: I also worked for a company that used virtual network printers to take output from expensive ERP apps (JD Edwards, SAP) and put the data into a document (invoice, PO, check) the client designed, then output the document to printers, email, file server or XML.  It sounds pretty simple. But it wasn't. For one thing, our software fully supported regular expressions, and clients LOVED adding all the IF\THEN statements you could imagine into the software. So you'd have something like ""IF SALESCENTER = 'CHICAGO' THEN PRINT TO \\CHICAGO\HP12. IF SALESCENTER = 'BUFFALO' THEN EMAIL TO BUFFALOHQ@DOMAIN.COM. IF SALESCENTER = 'AUSTIN' THEN SAVE TO \\AUSTIN\DOCS, PRINT TO \\AUSTIN\HP34 AND EMAIL TO AUSTINHQ@DOMAIN.COM"". Our software also had its own scripting language; there was a command called TODOLLARS, for example, that would convert ""$10,812"" to ""Ten Thousand Eight Hundred and Twelve"", which was needed to print checks. We also supported MICR, which meant that there were escape codes aplenty.  Our clients would constantly find ways to make things as difficult as possible. My company recommended setting up one virtual printer per document. So checks, invoices, purchase orders, etc. would all go to different virtual printers. But some clients (especially hospitals) only wanted one virtual printer for an entire organization. So they'd have to make a ""master document"" whose sole purpose would be to scan the incoming document, figure out what it was, then forward the contents to the appropriate document (analogy: instead of having individual department email accounts - sales@, hr@, finance@ - your client insisted on having a single mail@ address and thus needed an insanely complex set of Exchange rules to figure out how to forward the email to the correct internal recipient). Some clients had overseas offices, and wanted our documents to convert invoices and POs from GBP to USD on the fly. Some wanted UNICODE character sets changed on the fly. I once had to help a Russian guy who I could barely understand convert his output from <some form of the Russian character set> to <another form of the Russian character set>, but it would crash our software... but only on one particular server. I once spent 4 hours working with a client who had a single virtual printer for 15,000 employees, and who wanted the output to bounce around 20 different servers, but SURPRISE SURPRISE! it wasn't working.   Every single day I worked there was a mindfuck. I was confused 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. What's worse, the company's software ran on Windows, Unix and AS400. And officially, the company only supported 2 versions back, but unofficially they supported every version they had ever made, dating back to the late 80s. When I started there, the software was at version 7.6.235 (or thereabouts). One day I got a call from a client who was having a problem with version .233 (copyright 1989). My supervisor had to call the CEO in for that one, because he was the only person left who worked there back then.  TL:DR: When you tell customers they can ""do whatever"" with your software, they will indeed ""do whatever"" with it."

Also as I did so, I discovered there's a whole segment of the population who require that you charge more. If you do good work, they want you to be in business the next time they need you.

Most people think that it's so we can charge more for the parts, which is simply not the case. We have no idea where it came from, whether it's a new, used, or refurb component, the condition it arrived in, how it was handled during transport from them to us, etc...

The reason why it's so quick and easy for me is because I've spent years and thousands of hours and dollars learning and training so that I can do something in ten minutes that would take you an hour or more. That's worth something. With all my clients, if each one called and took ten minutes of my time, that would mean I would be donating hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month without pay.""  or if they complain that they can get the job done for less money at a competitor;  ""I don't know much about how others run their business. Personally, I know that I have to do the best job possible for my clients. The clients I have are very happy and seem to find my rates competitive.""  If they continue to be combative on price, I conveniently become ""too busy"" to answer their calls or emails.   A customer that nit-picks every dollar is not a customer that you want. No job will ever be good enough, the price will always be too high, and they'll bad mouth you and your business to anyone who will listen.  Keeping a customer like that will cost you (tons) in the long run."

Thank him for his business, and tell him to have a good day.  Then, raise your prices. Here is why... this work might seem easy but it takes a lot of specialized knowledge that you possess and the customer doesn't. This is what is worth the money. Yes, you can fix problems quickly, and they can't fix those problems AT ALL.

That's not to say you shouldn't advertise on CL (I don't) but, if you do, do it in a way that will deter those clients from contacting you.  I took my local average competitor's rates and priced myself just a little above that.  BUT, in my jobs, I make sure that I'm going the extra mile.

computertechs,39673p,singathrow,6,Tue Jun 9 15:24:38 2015 UTC,You don't need any. Most computer techs are self taught or managed to get a lucky break in a job than gave them experience.   If you want to get qualified a good starting point would be the A+ cert. There is loads of free vids on-line for this so take a look at them and see if its for you.

However, don't expect a networking job out of the gate you will start with Helpdesk roles. Just know CCENT or CCNA looks way better to some companies than an A+, but some jobs require an A+ cert like being a Dell hardware tech.  On the other hand, if you are able to pass a CCNA or CCENT (first half of CCNA) the A+ test will be a cake walk.   But if school isn't your thing, get your A+ then Network+ and Security+ you should be set."

computertechs,39673p,bclimer,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:39:36 2015 UTC,"Non-Degree here.  I started doing freelance work for small business and customers/non-business. Then I started doing contract warranty work(You can usually find craigslist ads..if you can secure an A+ you can get a job.) I landed an entry level job at an MSP...started being the first one there and last to leave...worked 60-70 hour weeks for my first two years and constantly wanted to learn more...I took on tasks that weren't getting done, researched, and completed them...The nice thing about an MSP is it gives you a lot of exposure...the one I was at dealt with companies ranging from small >5 companies to large 200+, multiple location, 24x7 operation companies..so it gives you exposure to a lot of solutions and lets you see what kind of company you're a good fit for...  The two big things are networking(e.g. Meetups and conferences) and experience... I worked for that MSP for 3 years and during that time I had multiple job offers..The last one I got caught my attention...  I've been at the new job for less than 2 months and already had 3 job offers for 20k more than I make now which is 1.5x what I made at the MSP...most of those offers came from people I met at conferences.  Last piece of info..during my time at the MSP there was an on-site IT guy who wasn't good at his job..but he became really good friends with the CFO even though no one intially talked to him..he stayed at the job for 2-3 years and was one of the top paid employees...6 figures...that said that's not an excuse to do a crappy job..just something to keep in mind.  TLDR: Work hard, Network with people, help the people you network with, and gain experience. The jobs will roll in."

With a little luck I hope we can save the computer.  I picked it up on eBay for $96 and would have had it working if I hadn't damaged this damn connector.  The computer has a 1080p 12"" touch-screen display, 128GB SSD, 4GB ram, and a 4th gen intel Core i5 processor, so it's definitely worth putting some more time and effort into fixing it considering my very modest monetary investment."
computertechs,396ufu,Hoxtaliscious,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:08:47 2015 UTC,"The worst damage you can do ripping things off of the motherboard like that is to tear up the pads themselves; that's very hard to fix. It sounds like you didn't so that, and may just need to reflow the solder and everything will be OK. Carefully using a hot air gun, you should be able to fix this.  The best advice for micro soldering is practice. If this is reasonably valuable to you, don't make this your first attempt at micro soldering. If you have any old motherboards/cell phones/keyboards/whatever, try working with them first."
computertechs,392hmy,zjpiazza,2,Mon Jun 8 19:51:41 2015 UTC,If you are interested in security and have a pretty clean record. I'm sure you could get hired with a Federal contract based tech firm doing remote support and in house NOC maintenance. Just look up NOC analyst jobs in Houston. You may have to work odd hours but you might be able to study and get paid at least 30k. Plus you will get a security clearance with real paid experience.   Edit: you will also gain valuable experience with secure VPN platforms and network monitoring software. Helping set up and maintain the safety nets of protected networks.
computertechs,392hmy,Cream5oda,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:02:16 2015 UTC,Wow thank you so much for this recommendation!

computertechs,392hmy,Cream5oda,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:55:30 2015 UTC,"Depending on the contract, especially if the pay is only hovering around 15/hr you shouldn't need much experience."
computertechs,392hmy,Cream5oda,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:52:28 2015 UTC,Yeah I would be fine making 15 an hour. However the other issue is it appears most of these NOC jobs are full time which is not feasible for me as I will be a full-time student for another year.

When I was in school, one of my instructors got me an interview with an MSP and they ended up taking me on full time. I don't know how I would have found something like this on my own - the best I was able to get by myself was a repair tech interview, so it was a combination of knowing the right people and getting lucky.  This was at HCCS, the same town as you. I know a couple of instructors who do that for students and I believe that they're still teaching - I know that one guy sometimes teaches at UH.  This is why I always advise students to get to know the faculty at their IT programs. A lot of those guys were or are still active in the industry and will have contacts or advice, at the very least. Most of them are there to help as long as you're not wasting their time."

Media works on legacy and UEFI devices, and inherently has drivers for basically anything including USB 3.0 controllers and touchscreens since I build it off Win8.1.  If you build your media on an x64 OS, the resulting PE environment will be x64, and any tool you run will have to be an x64 executable. So bear that in mind."

It stores your programs and settings, Simply overrides with new drivers every startup. Because of this I suggest you put it on an SSD.   In fact you can make the drive with a USB enclosure, then remove it. You can boot it from SATA Internally from any system (Faster read and write times through SATA, USB 3.0 is finicky in contrast due to drivers at startup.) Thing being if you boot it from SATA, It must always boot from SATA. Same goes for USB.   I typically use this for anything. Especially when your wondering if something is hardware or software, Or if a wipe would fix the issue or not. Boot some portable 8 and run Heavyload, Bam its the ram or a popped capacitor, Or its software, You know right away.

computertechs,38qcxh,CaptainHowdySaidNo,6,Fri Jun 5 23:41:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely itemize. This is what my repair shop does too. We take an initial diagnostic fee that goes towards their repair. The boss usually has set prices for various jobs, but the customer doesn't know this (unless they have been doing business with us for awhile).  The system has been working very well for the past 14+ years since they started doing it. Recently, we implemented a diagnostic coupon system. If a customer declines the repair, we give them a free diagnostic credit for a future diagnostic.  Also, I second /u/CaptainHowdySaidNo. ""Never trust a customer's diagnosis."""
computertechs,38qcxh,phasik,3,Sat Jun 6 01:02:48 2015 UTC,"Never trust a customer's diagnosis.   Probably 50% of all calls say ""I think I have a virus"" and they're almost always wrong."

computertechs,38qcxh,_LeggoMyEggo_,2,Sat Jun 6 18:17:30 2015 UTC,"Then, if I may be so bold, you need to review what you're saying to people on the phone.  There are plenty of tire-kickers out there, who call just for a quick opinion  but you might be scaring them off.  Out of 10 tire-kickers, you should be able to convert at least a couple of them into customers.  I know, for example, that I charge a little more for virus removal than my competitors but I know I'm doing a lot more than just running ADW/MBAM and declaring it clean; I run a full hardware diagnostic, tons of scans, cleanup, full updates, full maintenance and so on.  And I tell them that on the phone.  I will still not get the cheapskate customers (and I'm okay with that) but show them your confidence and that should bring a few in."

computertechs,38qcxh,SerpentDrago,3,Sun Jun 7 16:26:12 2015 UTC,"In store, itemized flat rate. On site, by hour. This way you are able to multitask stuff that takes a while, but is generally low-labor intensive like virus cleans or reload/backups and reserves on-sites for things that actually require you to go onsite maximizing your output.  N-E-V-E-R just go blindly off what the customer says. If they knew how to diagnose a problem properly, they would know how to fix it.  Just this week alone, I had ""I think it's dead dead"" mean ""it goes slow on the internet,"" ""It just won't turn on"" mean ""it doesn't load my desktop"" and ""Internet is not working"" means that once every three days or so, Orbitz's website will lock up. ALWAYS charge a checkout fee/diagnostic to cover the time it sits on the bench at the very least. Let this diagnostic apply toward the labor cost. This way they don't use you for a diagnosis and then take the computer elsewhere. Also, sometimes people just want a diagnosis (mostly for insurance purposes).  Just a suggestion, price virus removals and wipe/reload + backup the same. That way if you ever just can't get a bug scrubbed or Windows is just FUBAR'd from infection, you have that backup and it doesn't sound like you're just tacking more shit onto the customer's bill."

Flat rate labor can be easily profitable, with only an occasional overrun if your techs perform accurate diagnostics and quality documentation is in place."
computertechs,38qcxh,LeaveTheMatrix,2,Sat Jun 6 03:18:25 2015 UTC,"I'd take a look at the other repair businesses in your area, take the lowest one and the highest one and price yourself accordingly.

computertechs,38qcxh,SerpentDrago,2,Sat Jun 6 03:52:26 2015 UTC,"Flat rates for the shop, hourly for onsite, charge no less than 80 if by yourself, 125 at the minimum for employees. (onsite rates anyway)  charge 150 for overhauls, 90 for HDD installs, etc. Aim for higher end clientele if possible. undercut the town's most popular computer repair shop if possible.  charge a flat rate that will not bankrupt you but not piss off the customer either, have them sign waivers when they check in their stuff.  Use quickbooks to track your customers and invoices.   Free estimates attract customers, diagnose and let them know what is wrong, some will leave to go to a cheaper shop but that's rare and you dont want to win customers on price, you'll lose them on price as well. win them on service and satisfaction."
computertechs,38qcxh,Alistair_Mann,2,Sat Jun 6 04:03:57 2015 UTC,"Customer says motherboard is dead, do you still run diagnostic or just replace the motherboard on their word alone.    It is still good to run standard diagnostics.  I got many repeat customers because of finding stuff like a lose cable.   I don't do it to much these days, just as a weekend type things only through referrals but back in the day when I was doing it full time I would do a combination of itemize and flat rate.    Something that can be done in a couple of hours, itemize.   Something like a wipe and OS reinstall, where you have a lot of time you can be doing something else, flat rate.    The trick to doing this is to determine what needs your full attention the whole time and what doesn't (like OS install).   I followed this route, and would be working on multiple clients systems at once, some flat rate some itemized."

computertechs,38qcxh,markevens,2,Mon Jun 8 23:01:15 2015 UTC,tiered service is bad idea. if customer needs more then they expect looks like you are upselling . or they do lowest one and expect more
computertechs,38qcxh,markevens,2,Mon Jun 15 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"Flat-price + parts here.  I have a full rate and a discount rate. The discounted rate is designed to separate out people that don't mind waiting from those who want to be seen by three days before it went wrong last week. I have a dayrate, and a bigco rate, which are nice when they happen but lead to the wrong kind of work.  Hardware install will be a half-hour minimum; OS reinstall an hour minimum, 1.5 hours if it includes significant data transfer. Data recovery/backup: I would treat that work as an addition, and charge separately: 1.5hrs for normal data recovery, upto 3hrs if deep scan is required. If the original machine is 3yo or more, I'll often suggest a new hdd to hold the reinstall, and slave off the old hdd temporarily to transfer the user data over.  Customer confidence is a delicate thing: not replacing a mobo they believe defective can leave them blaming future problems on not getting it replaced, as they wanted. If they want it replaced, they get it.  I would do a diagnostic for my own interest, and I always report the results if asked to, or if the results changes advice I've given them."
computertechs,38qcxh,dracho,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:25:56 2015 UTC,"A mix of Flat Rate + Parts and Hourly (There are 30 and 15 minutes options i offer) but one thing i've noticed is that flat rate is clear but not as profitable but for most customers seem reasonable. But sometimes charging hourly is a good idea, for instance a customer wanted me to change 2 screws in the laptop, to do that i had to end up taking the entire laptop apart then rebuild with extra screws (the screws were by the hinge), since it took an hour, i charged £35 (going rate at the time) for that hour, the customer was unhappy since she complained that she was charged £17 to fit one screw. TL DR: Common problems are better with flat rates is my suggestion"
computertechs,38qcxh,JaredsFatPants,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:54:56 2015 UTC,"Never take the customer's word for it, ever.  Still note what they say and use their information, but you have to make your own diagnostic.   Charge a flat rate.  Call around other local shops for the pricing, and match them.  Do NOT undercut, you will just bring the profit down for everyone when they try to match you and start a low bidding war.   Always offer all the services you can.  Let them turn down what they want, but a couple times a month I get someone who wants an SSD upgrade that wouldn't have gotten it if I hadn't offered it.    Never do anything for free.  If the HDD is bad, they need to pay for a new part (with markup) the hardware install, the OS install, and if they want programs and data moved.    Go ahead and offer an all in one package for that, but just because they are paying for a new hdd and an OS install doesn't mean they get a free data transfer."
computertechs,38qcxh,dlbby,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:40:52 2015 UTC,Thank you! I've learned my lesson after sitting at a business for over 9 hrs and I'm switching to hourly billing. I already offer everything that I can and will outsource what I can't do. Now when you say they need to pay for the OS install and data transfer are these desperate fees from your hourly rate?   Are you charging  100Hr + 80 for install  Or   Only the hourly rate
computertechs,38qcxh,LeaveTheMatrix,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:08:30 2015 UTC,"If I focused on one machine at a time, I might consider hourly, but I prefer flat rate because I can work on multiple machines at once and clients feel more comfortable when they know what the cost will be up front.   I assume you ask about my hdd pricing, this is how it adds up.    HDD + markup (~$70-$150 depending on capacity and HDD vs SSD) Hardware install $40 Clone $70   If I can't clone it either   OS install $100 (and they survive without their data) or OS install + Data transfer + 4 Program install $150   So when it is all said and done, replacing a HDD and moving all the data is ~$200-$350 depending on what the client wants done."
computertechs,38qcxh,dlbby,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:44:53 2015 UTC,"For labor, I charge by the minute, then round up to 15 minute intervals.  But if I can walk away from the machine, I won't be charging for the time I'm away.  For instance, if it takes 20 seconds to open Auslogics Disk Defrag and start the process, I will charge them for 1 minute of labor.  It runs for an hour, but that's fine, I can do other stuff in the mean time.  If that was the only thing that needed to be done, I'd charge them $15 since I round up to the nearest 15 minute mark.  I charge $1 / minute.  I'll give them a fairly wide estimate for a board replacement or laptop power jack, I'd tell them I'd estimate the cost to be between $30 - $60 but if there are major issues, it might be more, in which case I would call to get approval for additional labor charges.    If they said right off the bat that they wanted the board replaced, I would ask them if they'd like me to perform a $15 diagnostic to be sure the board is indeed malfunctioning, or skip it and just replace it.  My flat rate packages for reinstallation of an OS are $50 for a basic fresh install, or $100 for a fresh install, plus data backup and installation and configuration of up to 5 programs.  Data backup before work is started is mandatory in my book.  (I worked for a company that lost data on a business client's machine, and... needless to say the company went under.)  I charge 5 or 10 minutes for the backup process - whether it can be done locally or if I have to pull the drive and hook it up to a dedicated backup machine.  After the backup is complete, I compare the data from the backup to the original.  Data recovery flat rate fee is $30 from an undamaged drive.  If it's damaged, then I tell them I'd estimate the cost to be $30 - $60, an will call to get approval if it's an extreme case that will cost more.  I always end with a 5 minute final check over.    The bare minimum I charge is $30.  This includes 5-10 minutes of backup, the 5 minute final check, and 15 minutes of labor."

I usually don't recommend Combofix unless it's 100% necessary, but it does catch and remediate where other tools often fail.  (it also has the potential to make an unstable OS worse off moreso than other scanners).  So exercise caution there.  Another good way to look at malware remediation is to break it up into tasks/objectives.  Something like:   Detect and remove rootkits:  (TDSSKiller/GMER/Rkill/etc) Scan and remove common malware (Spybot/Hitmanpro/Adwcleaner/MalwareBytes/etc) Follow up with checking autoruns (Sysinternals Autoruns/CCleaner/etc) Restore system integrity (File Permissions/Registry permissions/SFC/Tweaking Windows Repair) Harden system to prevent further exploits (Create a separate admin acct, and drop standard rights/EMET/Winpatrol/Secunia PSI/WOT/etc)"
computertechs,38oq95,ajeoae,6,Fri Jun 5 17:08:25 2015 UTC,Combofix is usually a hail mary.

I told him he had 2mins 30secs to remember it, because that's how long it would take to gain access. ""Oh no, heavy expense, yada yada ...

If you download a knoppix LiveCD on another machine, burn it to the appropriate media, you can almost certainly boot the system into Knoppix Linux. It's very simple to use and allows you to access pretty much everything on the booted computer without changing anything. If you wanted to get some pictures, documents, something specific like that and had a general idea of where to look you could find them and copy them off onto a flashdrive. Also, if there is no optical drive in the PC in question, boot it on a PC that does have one, go to the menu and use ""Install Knoppix to Flash disk""  I couldn't really get a idea of how computer literate you are, and your posting history doesn't really give me much of a clue, so I apologize if I am coming across wrong. If you aren't very computer literate, a knoppix liveCD is a fairly safe, fairly easy way to get limited access to a computer that you can't get into."

There are tons of guides on the Internet on how to do it. When you boot into GRUB, one of the options will be for the tool I mentioned.   Follow the prompts, and remember to BLANK out the password, do not change it. I have seen installs of win7 broken by changing the password, and not just disabling it.   Once done, exit out and remove the disk. Then open Windows, and using the account you changed, set a new password.   There are a ton of guides better than the few instructions I gave. I would recommend you read on how to use the tool before you actually do it.   Also, if there is important data, 8t goes without saying to back it up before attempting it.

I had what I think is a similar experience to you with my old x58 board. It always had I/O problems due to early discrete SATA6G and USB3 controllers with poor driver support.

It would pass test after test, but after deciding to live a few days with different RAM loadouts, I deduced that the 3rd channel was wonky. That board currently serves as my HTPC/GameServer. It is much happier nowadays not being drilled on to play hardcore games on a daily basis and just having to run Netflix, Chrome, Minecraft Server and Space Engineers Server.

Yea, you get a handful spending ~$100 to upgrade, but other than that, the only revenue from a new OS comes from manufacturers buying OEM licenses and other volume/corporate customers.  So if Microsoft gives free Win10 upgrades to users on an older OS (especially Win7) that would otherwise stay on that older OS, that puts those users in a newer ecosystem where money can be made through Store purchases, Xbox Music/Video subscriptions, devices purchases(HoloLens, Windows 10 Mobile phones), and so much more.

For networking, you'll need to know your protocols, OSI layers, Cisco IOS/JunOS, etc. Your computer will just be used to remote into other devices in addition to normal business use, so it's not going to need a lot of power. I've found it handy to have a serial port, SSD, and 8+GB RAM, but that's for actual work use.  You don't need Linux - most of the network engineers I know aren't great with it - but it certainly helps. Ideally, you'd be well versed in both Windows and Linux simply because of their use in business environments, but you can learn networking just as well on a Mac. When you're logged into a router it's going to be the router's OS that matters. Hell, you could use a smartphone if you can deal with the screen size and virtual keyboard.   As someone else mentioned, a networking lab kit would probably be a better investment."
computertechs,3820du,ITGuyLevi,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:45:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I think I am going to stick to getting a lenovo or dell and dual boot windows and Linux. (Just typing that is hard for me)  I'm really trying to get on the fast track to learning so when I move in November I can get a help desk job ASAP.  I will look into getting the gear for a home lab too. There is a lot of conflicting thoughts on the right type of laptop. Really I am willing to bite the bullet and get something I don't really want but will help me in getting a job and being familiar with the gear a business will already be using. (Windows,dell,toshiba)  Luckily I will have one home network to setup and one small business network to set up as soon as I move."
computertechs,3820du,Bose_Motile,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:32:09 2015 UTC,"That should work. From what I've seen, businesses commonly use HPs and Dells - at my job we use HPs, and their consumer laptops have a bad rep but their business computers are fairly solid."
computertechs,37xthj,markusbolarkus,4,Sun May 31 08:11:56 2015 UTC,"I started by finding Deployment Projects, and Break-Fix Projects.  Once I got some time in with those, it lead to me getting my first Helpdesk Job.  Do whatever is out there to get your foot in the door and get some time with technology, anything."
computertechs,37xthj,PDXracer,2,Sun May 31 08:46:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, you're up late/early. Yeah, I guess I'm pretty much open to anything. Just not having the best results. I'll keep trying though, thanks."
computertechs,37xthj,Eihwaz,2,Sun May 31 08:53:52 2015 UTC,"Install VirtualBox (or equivalent), DL Win Server ISOs and build yourself a lab.  Get some CBT Nuggets / TrainSignal / Global Knowledge videos (most of the time, they're scenarios, it's more fun and you learn a ton).  Learn about AD/DHCP/DNS/Print Server/File Server/Backups, the videos I mentionned before will help you with that :). Check some cool subreddits too, I love /r/sysadmin /r/techsupport. You'll learn a ton there.  Mention that in your resume, IT people loooove self-taught people.  It landed me my first job, which was a part-time short-tem contract. I ended up working a few years there :)"
computertechs,37xthj,Eihwaz,2,Sun May 31 09:08:33 2015 UTC,"This is great, thank you! I considered ccna and a+ in the past and would definitely be open to them and others in the future."
computertechs,37xthj,massiveinstigator,3,Sun May 31 09:29:05 2015 UTC,"Also, Professer Messer's videos are really cool."

computertechs,37xthj,kakkoiiko,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:00:31 2015 UTC,"A ""home"" lab, a network of machines where you'll be able to tinker with stuff without fear of breaking something :D"
computertechs,37xthj,OSUTechie,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:38:53 2015 UTC,Or with plans to break all the things! And learn how to recover!
computertechs,37xthj,Raw_Venus,2,Sat Jun 6 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"I had 0 job experience, I went out and got my A+, Network+, Security+, CCNA and 2 A.S. degrees in Network Administration and that pretty much made up for my lack of job experience, my first job ever was an IT job at $17/hour as a tier 1 tech support agent. Certs will get you in the door, but the most important thing is that you really know your stuff.  They took a gamble on me because they were on the fence about the no-experience deal. But once hired, I killed it was promoted directly to tier 3 two months later (out of 120+ techs, there were only 4x tier 3 techs at the time, so it was kind of a big deal).  Generally, certs are a good way to make up for a lack of experience, once you get that experience, it combined with higher level certs (I'm a CCNP now) will get you into better jobs."
computertechs,37xthj,agentgreasy,2,Sun May 31 12:48:40 2015 UTC,"If you want some experience to help pad your resume, look at craigslist. You typically can find some low end one time type of jobs which can help. See here"
computertechs,37w27f,kvnmahan,3,Sat May 30 21:47:22 2015 UTC,Sugru?
computertechs,37w27f,neonicacid,2,Sat May 30 22:12:36 2015 UTC,"Second Sugru, or Epoxy putty. Would then need to paint it, but it's what we use for holes and the like."
computertechs,37w27f,neshnz,2,Sun May 31 01:33:38 2015 UTC,http://shop.plastimake.com/products/plastimake-starter-kit you can find it on amazon for pretty cheap
computertechs,37w27f,beardedheathen,1 point,Sun May 31 19:05:56 2015 UTC,"That looks pretty great. What are the chances of the computer's heat remelting it though, given that it becomes moldable in just hot water?"
computertechs,37w27f,beardedheathen,2,Sun May 31 21:25:25 2015 UTC,If your computer gets that hot I think you've got other serious problems.
computertechs,37w27f,DaddyBeanDaddyBean,1 point,Sun May 31 23:02:28 2015 UTC,Alright. I just wasn't sure what its melting point is.
computertechs,37w27f,jscheunemann,1 point,Sun May 31 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"Expoxy putty (works good, smells bad) or JB Weld.  I'm partial to the JB Kwik flavor. Build it up in the broken area, and when fully cured, carefully shave & sand it back down smooth."

computertechs,37txht,Hatman135,3,Sat May 30 10:42:08 2015 UTC,Get a homelab going! /r/homelab can help you get started.
computertechs,37txht,organman91,3,Sat May 30 14:36:42 2015 UTC,"I would build labs and practice, especially if you're working on improving your craft. Find a specialized tech discipline that you're interested in, and study that."
computertechs,37txht,deeperkyo,1 point,Sat May 30 13:06:31 2015 UTC,Buy and and rebuild machines from Craigslist.  As well as what others have suggested as well.
computertechs,37txht,OSUTechie,1 point,Sat May 30 16:50:34 2015 UTC,"ok, I'll keep these things in mind. Thanks!"
computertechs,37txht,Epos_Metallicus,1 point,Sun May 31 00:01:39 2015 UTC,Break things.
computertechs,37txht,ITGuyLevi,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:15:47 2015 UTC,"Don't put all your time into it but if you know of any small businesses or groups (churches, clubs, etc) they will always accept free/cheap help.  As a bonus, I guarantee they will find ways to break things that you will never even dream possible!"
