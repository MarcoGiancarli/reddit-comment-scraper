Boise,3e4h14,Redpythongoon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:25:36 2015 UTC,Thank you so much.  She's been found and is home now. :)
Boise,3e4h14,Ovedya2011,2,Wed Jul 22 03:32:21 2015 UTC,"Update! She's been found and is home safe!  She's scared and tired but safe.  Thanks everyone for keeping an eye out.  It worked!  :)  My friend’s dog, Babygirl, went missing last night near Overland and Federal Way after a gate was left open.  Her brother who she was traveling around town with was found this morning at the Humane Society but she’s still missing.  She was last seen at around 7 this morning in the Parkcenter area, off of Apple and Bergeson.  She is very friendly, loves to “talk” and loves other dogs and kids.  Her family is out desperately looking for her so please message me if you see her.  Thank you!   More pics of her:  Babygirl2  Babygirl3  Babygirl4"
Boise,3e4h14,Ovedya2011,2,Tue Jul 21 21:57:05 2015 UTC,I'm around the university. I'll keep an eye peeled while I'm out.

Boise,3e3467,Boise13,5,Tue Jul 21 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"This ""news"" article doesn't say anything, thanks for wasting our time."
Boise,3e3467,lacerik,5,Tue Jul 21 19:38:09 2015 UTC,Sure it did. It said that a guy is starting to work on a thing that might do stuff probably. It was very clear on that point.
Boise,3e3467,blind_duck,4,Tue Jul 21 20:17:44 2015 UTC,"Wait a minute, you're say a person might do a thing! dramatic musical sting"
Boise,3e3467,lacerik,4,Tue Jul 21 20:26:37 2015 UTC,A thing?!  I have been waiting for a thing to happen since time!
Boise,3e3467,caseyoc,4,Tue Jul 21 21:45:33 2015 UTC,"The Spokesman Review reports, Hill says he doesn’t believe businesses should deny services to someone based on their sexual orientation, but he also doesn’t want to force them to participate if it goes against their religious beliefs.   Mmm, that double speak."
Boise,3e3467,Scipion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:20 2015 UTC,"Well there's a shitty misleading title if I ever heard one.  The guy doesn't want private businesses to be forced to enter into contracts that the business don't want to enter.  Unless you guys want to have bigots getting your money, this sounds like a good bill."
Boise,3e3467,willsueforfood,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:34 2015 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from, but is a bill really necessary?  We already don't have protections for LGBT people in our state, on a state level, so there's nothing to force them to serve LGBT individuals outside of a few localities that did pass protections."
Boise,3e3467,ReverandDave,3,Tue Jul 21 17:32:33 2015 UTC,"""outside of a few localities that did pass protections""  I think we've spotted what the bill's aiming at."
Boise,3e3467,willsueforfood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:33 2015 UTC,It makes sense now.
Boise,3e3467,ReverandDave,0,Tue Jul 21 18:33:19 2015 UTC,So businesses should have the right to discriminate?   Seems pretty shitty to me.
Boise,3e3467,K1N6F15H,3,Tue Jul 21 18:33:35 2015 UTC,"Nobody has a right to contract with an unwilling party, even if that party's unwillingness has a shitty reason behind it.  If we force everyone to play nice, we'll just end up giving more money to the bigots."
Boise,3e3467,willsueforfood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:27 2015 UTC,Seems like a big step back in our society when we can refuse services to a certain group of people because we don't like them. Reminds me a lot of pre-civil rights movement in America.
Boise,3e3467,yellowsubmarinr,5,Tue Jul 21 21:57:19 2015 UTC,"Imagine what would happen to the business that did this.   Statesman's headline: ""Joe's Generic Diner posts signs saying 'no fags allowed'""   Just how long would an asshole like that stay in business?  Right now, people can do that. Nobody does because they'd get crucified in the court of public opinion, and rightfully so.   I think it's a mistake to think that every wrong action should be illegal."
Boise,3e3467,willsueforfood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:12:47 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.. look at what happened to Chik-Fil-A when there was controversy over what the owners donated to (lots and lots of anti-gay groups). Their restaurants had record days. I think you underestimate the strength of the anti-gay advocates.   Being able to discriminate against people and refuse service because you disagree with their lifestyle, race, hair color, whatever, is not what America is about, IMO"
Boise,3e3467,yellowsubmarinr,3,Tue Jul 21 22:23:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, but if you are adamantly for gay rights, would you really want to give Chik-Fil-A your business?  You have the right to discriminate against them, shouldn't they have the same right?"
Boise,3e3467,float_the_river,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:26:25 2015 UTC,"No, when you open a business that isn't a club, there are certain rules that you have to follow; not discriminating against protected groups is one of them"
Boise,3e3467,yellowsubmarinr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:58:52 2015 UTC,"You walk into my store. Hypothetically, you're an asshole and I refuse service. I'm refusing service because I think you are disrespectful to my staff. All is well  If I kick you out because you're white and I hypothetically hate white people, that's when it's not okay.  And no, I'm saying if you're a club, the rules are different and then you can discriminate against whoever you want to, because you're not open to the public."
Boise,3e3467,yellowsubmarinr,2,Tue Jul 21 23:14:28 2015 UTC,"I'm glad Bigot-Fil-A did what they did.  Now I know where not to spend my money.   America is all about being able to do what you want with your own property.  If Bigot-Fil-A wants to do its thing, so be it.  It's their right to be wrong.    We can't sanitize the world of bad opinions through legislation. All we can do is cover them up and bottle them up until they explode."
Boise,3e3467,willsueforfood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:24:00 2015 UTC,"I just don't see the difference between this and segregation and the other terrible things we used to do in this country. I don't believe they should have the right to discriminate because they are a business open to the public, and the public means everybody."
Boise,3e3467,yellowsubmarinr,2,Tue Jul 21 22:33:38 2015 UTC,"If you owned a business, wouldn't you want to be able to decide who comes onto your property? Wouldn't you want to be able to exclude hate groups, like the KKK from showing up in their dresses and hats?"
Boise,3e3467,willsueforfood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:43:02 2015 UTC,"KKK isn't a protected group, like I believe the LGBT community should be. I guess I should revise my earlier statement; you shouldn't be able to discriminate against people for race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or religion. I think the civil rights movement in the 1960s was a big step for this country but they left out an important group, and now is when we can fix that. And I do run a business in East Boise and I don't think I should have the right to exclude anyone a part of the groups I listed above"
Boise,3e3467,yellowsubmarinr,0,Tue Jul 21 22:45:00 2015 UTC,"Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States.  Read up on it, but not only are you wrong legally, you seem to not understand how bigots work.  If businesses were allowed to discriminate we would be seeing Jim Crow behavior by random bigots even to this day.  The problem with your libertarian thinking (well, one of the many problems) is that if the majority of the population supports bigotry (like many towns in Idaho) there are no real financial punishments for that discrimination. In fact, that bigoted majority is likely to boycott openly unbigoted companies at their detriment.   There is no reason protected groups should not be able to appreciate the same lifestyle everyone else can afford."
Boise,3e3467,K1N6F15H,3,Tue Jul 21 22:56:22 2015 UTC,"I've read Heart of Atlanta, and thought it was an incorrectly decided case that possibly did good things in America.   I understand how bigots work, and I think it is strange that you think we live in the same era as the 1960s.    After all, it is perfectly legal for places to openly discriminate against homosexuals right now.  Where do you see it happening?"
Boise,3e3467,willsueforfood,0,Tue Jul 21 22:40:11 2015 UTC,"Not to sound like I'm belittling you but I could care less what you think is constitutionally flawed, this has been interpreted as the law of the land by better men than you or I.   Now as far as your second point goes, the beauty of your flawed argument is this:    If it isn't happening now, you have no reason to worry and therefore no justification behind passing a bill to defend the right to discriminate.   This double-bind wraps you up nicely, add that to any existing harms represented in the status quo of Heart of Atlanta, you have no leg to stand on. There is no current precedent for this free contract nonsense you are referring to and if there is no danger of discrimination currently than there is no justification for allowing that alleged discrimination to occur."
Boise,3e3467,K1N6F15H,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"""Not to sound like an asshole, but I'm going to be an asshole""  I don't expect you to care about my opinions.  I just don't want you to get the government to force everyone to think like you, which is exactly what you are doing."
Boise,3e3467,willsueforfood,-1,Wed Jul 22 01:44:54 2015 UTC,Nobody has a right to contract with an unwilling party   So you want us to go back to businesses being able to discriminate against women and blacks?
Boise,3e3467,_corwin,4,Wed Jul 22 02:24:17 2015 UTC,"The Libertarian in me says yes. There should be certain protections, such as from the Government and housing. But I think a private company should be able to decide who they serve."
Boise,3e3467,float_the_river,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:14:26 2015 UTC,"Just picture a private practice doctor refusing a black man admittance during a heart attack.  Or a remote hotel refusing service for a woman because she is not accompanied by a chaperone.   We've already legally decided as a society these things are nonsense, a citizen of America shouldn't have to suffer such prejudice."
Boise,3e3467,K1N6F15H,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:24:32 2015 UTC,You really don't see a difference there?
Boise,3e3467,willsueforfood,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:50:03 2015 UTC,"You said a private company should decide who they serve. I gave you examples of your words and you still can't hold to them- this whole discussion has been you sticking to your philosophical speaking points without offering any reasonable refutation.  Discrimination based on things like race, gender, and religion is wrong. There is no sense in allowing bigots to exclude citizens under the vague and unfounded hope that their businesses might one day go under. Consumer anti-discrimination laws are practical, fair, and have long been in effect in the U.S."
Boise,3e3467,K1N6F15H,3,Wed Jul 22 02:23:39 2015 UTC,"Do you think we could?  I don't think very many businesses would be successful on that model.   If there's a business owner out there whose only reason for not putting up a ""no darkies"" sign is because he's afraid of being sued, I want to know about it so that I don't support his business."

Boise,3e116q,principledsociopath,2,Tue Jul 21 04:55:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. It's just a single boom. If it is fireworks, they're shooting off just one HUGE one each night."

Boise,3e116q,encephlavator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:02 2015 UTC,It's one single big boom. Not an ongoing noise.
Boise,3e116q,NefariousBanana,2,Wed Jul 22 03:55:52 2015 UTC,I was driving on Maple Grove and saw a single fireworks shell go off close to that area and time two nights ago. Looked and sounded to be maybe a 2- or 3-inch mortar.
Boise,3e116q,raymondio,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:02 2015 UTC,Could be some idiot shooting a gun if it's that loud. In which case they'd be in some trouble for sure.
Boise,3e116q,lacerik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:03:42 2015 UTC,It's much louder than any gun I've heard. And I've shot a bunch.
Boise,3e116q,Lothlorien_Randir,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:55:01 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you shot them with ear protection? That would muffle the noise. Also guns range in loudness, though I'm sure you know that. Could be a 30-06 or 12 Gauge, something really, really loud."
Boise,3dy9uv,TeslasIdea,11,Mon Jul 20 14:55:09 2015 UTC,I find your lack of details around the meeting disturbing.   What I'm saying is I would like more information please :D
Boise,3dy9uv,panda_foo,4,Mon Jul 20 15:38:04 2015 UTC,"My bad...guess I assumed those interested would have heard about it.  More people have contributed to our campaign than to any other candidate running for president, Democrat or Republican.  That is truly remarkable, and I am humbled by this support. But I will be frank: it may not matter in the end unless we get organized now.  On the evening of July 29, we will kick off building the organization that will take back our country from the billionaire class — and I’m going to speak directly by video to this unprecedented gathering.  People will gather at more than 1,000 homes, restaurants, and other locations across the country for our first ever national organizing meeting, including this event close to you:  Wednesday, July 29ᵗʰ at 7:00 pm MDT Boise Bernie Meeting 2267 N Dalton Ln Boise, ID 83704 More about this event: https://go.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/4jrxq  But there are many, many more events happening all over.

Boise,3dy9uv,panda_foo,3,Mon Jul 20 15:41:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for the details.  I honestly don't agree with everything he stands for but he is running a clean campaign and that gives me more respect for him than any other candidate. I'll be looking into this!
Boise,3dy9uv,encephlavator,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:48:46 2015 UTC,"""our campaign""   So this is an advertisement?"
Boise,3dy9uv,Nichijo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:41 2015 UTC,"It's either that, or it's an announcement!   Either way, so what?"
Boise,3dy9uv,encephlavator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:24:22 2015 UTC,"so what?   It's the way it was presented. First, circumventing the Q&A thread. Second, posing as if an interested 3rd party when it turns out (edit: it seemed as if) OP is the party hosting the meeting. OP should have posted something like this: [Event] Presidential campaign rally for Bernie Sanders.  Advertising  Self promotion is generally frowned upon.  It passes the solicitation test, but as I wrote above, it should have simply been posted as an [Event]. There's even a user flair tag for events."
Boise,3dy9uv,Nichijo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:10:17 2015 UTC,"Good points, thank you for a direct answer."
Boise,3dy9uv,Nichijo,3,Tue Jul 21 03:17:48 2015 UTC,It's an email I received from the Bernie Sanders campaign about meeting to help his campaign. I asked if anyone was going. Someone asked for more details so I just copied and pasted the text from the email. Sorry about that.

Boise,3dy9uv,Hippie_Gumbo,6,Mon Jul 20 15:43:52 2015 UTC,I've been asking around about this and haven't heard any solid response. I'm tempted to just call or text him at some point to see if he wants help organizing and finding another venue. We're not all finding parking - let alone fitting in his apartment.

Boise,3dlrch,Nichijo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:57:30 2015 UTC,"No, Idaho. An ""at-will employment"" state, where someone can be dismissed without cause, except for certain reasons protected by law (race, religion... ).   So I don't really see why the bill is either necessary (because they already can fire them) or legal (in case they are already protected by some other law).   BTW, people always confuse ""at-will"" employment with ""right-to-work state"". They're not the same thing! A ""right-to-work state"" has laws preventing mandatory union membership in any job -- AKA a ""closed shop"". It has nothing to do with an employer being able to fire someone without cause."
Boise,3dlrch,lordairivis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:26:02 2015 UTC,Being pregnant is also protected by law so it would seem that this bill is in direct violation of that.  Edit: upon reading the article it has come to my attention that the headline of this article is pretty misleading; the bill as written is intended to allow employers to discriminate against LGBT people and not unwed-mothers-to-be and the discrimination against unwed-mothers-to-be is just a side-effect of the ridiculously open-ended applications of the bill.

Boise,3dlrch,Boise13,6,Fri Jul 17 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"""freedom"" doesnt mean shit.   Liberty is the playing field that grants freedom and liberty grants people the ability to be able to work without being screwed by their employer for no reason or, barring, that, a stupid reason.  If things worked the way you wanted, people would be working for 10 cents a day because you dont realize that your brand of 'libertarianism' is almost anything but what you think it is.    Here is your answer directly as to why businesses cant do that stuff - those businesses use commerce that I pay for: I pay for the roads they bring goods around on. I pay for the judges they need to maintain legal contracts.  I pay for the internet backbone maintained by the government for them to do their ecommerce on.  The list goes on and on actually.  If my taxes pay for those things -- they are called 'the commons' which I thought libertarians that love the constitution would understand before anything -- if my taxes pay for them and you think you can use them while discriminating against me, it is called unrepresented taxation.   Surely a real ""libertarian"" understands something about unrepresented taxation and the role it played in our society?  Capitalism is not a government.  It is an economy and it exists in the playing field laid out by the system of government we chose.   Therefor, if my taxes are paying for your business to operate, which they are in every case, you can't discriminate against me.  edit:  came back to add one thing -- that you can't discriminate against me personally if I am a protected class.  That doesn't until recently include LGBT folks.  Once recognized, you can't discriminate.   But feel free to fire someone because they're albino or something since they aren't protected specifically."

Do you have any clue what you are talking about? So you are saying that the government taxes 10,000 a year from me for taxes, then they say ""ok, since you own a business, and are helping society flourish because of your work ethic, we are going to give you a 2,000 tax break"", that, somehow, has something to do with YOU?  Sorry pal, I probably still paid more than you in taxes last year so, I don't owe you shit However, you can work from 9-5pm for me if you would like to. If you believe in an honest day's work, if you believe in working and not being an entitled brat, I'm hiring.

Then maybe you should buy the property next to you if you don't want them to be able to do anything with it. Having an occasional ball come into your yard is a normal American neighborly concept.

Boise,3d9rzr,ihad4biscuits,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:02:46 2015 UTC,"Whether or not something is legal or permissible due to zoning or HOA rules has nothing to do with the outrage other than what the expectations were when they bought the property.   I hope he puts a swimming pool there and hosts unofficial pool volleyball games, complete with a hot tub right there by where the goal is, for maximum intrusion. :)   Like I said, it's a nuisance and possibly rude depending on how big the yard is but I don't see why it is so offensive. I wouldn't mind it if my neighbor did that. I'd ask if my family could use the court. Sounds like HOA will make him remove the goal though but your parents house will STILL be really close to their neighbor's."

And yes, they already got away with it, they aren't being asked to remove it and they aren't losing their HOA deposit.  The Harsins have a huge yard. My parents have a fairly modest yard (for Idaho standards) and that's why their utilizing so much of the property for their house. Plus it's not that close man, in fact I find that distance to the fence to be extremely normal.  Finally, when did I say that this is like, the most offensive thing that ever happened in the history of ever? I said my parents are unhappy about it which you can logically conclude means that they find it to be a nuisance and rude. In fact, why am I even taking the time to argue with you when you conceded the point and this is /r/boise for god's sake."

Certainly sucks the privacy out of the backyard though. Seems like they need to plant some columnar type trees or arborvitae there to block out the blue court and bat the balls back.  Did the Harsins talk to them at all about the project ahead of time?

Brewer's Haven on Vista will also sell kegs (that's where I get mine) for a 10% additional fee. They still charge the $30 deposit, but I find it convenient because they have access to any keg that's available.   Also, most local breweries will sell kegs.

Here's a bit of warning...If you buy 15 or 13 gallon keg, you might get sick of it by the time your done with it. I have a 2 tap system and usually buy 1/6 barrels.

I just can't believe someone taking him in the 10 to 20 minutes he was gone as they say. I know the family would rather think he has been abducted than dead which is kinda screwed up but I understand. It's a shitty situation... Also another possibility is they killed him accident or not and had to make some story and lead him to the lake on foot then picked him up and took him to a grave (this is the dabs 8 I was taking last nights idea). However I think he simply wondered into the water and drowned.

It'll bring prices down and speeds up throughout the valley as more and better infrastructure becomes available.  But, sadly, gigabit to the home is still a ways off for us. The biggest hurdle isn't the fiber in the streets (We have that all up and down the valley/State) but fiber into your house.   You need, at minimum 1000baseT 5e/6 copper cabling to get gig speeds, and fiber is mandatory for anything higher. Most houses have old copper plant that was installed with the intention of being used for phone lines. If you live in a newer house you might have the facilities to the street that will get you gigabit.   source: network engineer for local telecom."

Prior the only competition they had was clear which is a consumer trap in my opinion anyway.   I just don't think it'll live up to a lot of hype surrounding it on a consumer level.Especially when century links consumer fiber is honestly pretty decent. It's like $25 for 40 down/20 up with AFAIK no real data caps.

Boise,3cr2fw,manifest3r,2,Fri Jul 10 15:19:05 2015 UTC,I'm paying $90 for 75/down I believe. For business class at the same price I'd only be getting 30/down. So I'm not going to switch over unless they force me.  On the plus side I'd get a block of static IP's.
Boise,3cr2fw,snuxoll,2,Fri Jul 10 15:47:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't say business class was cheaper, just that it comes without limits. I get 75/5 for $125/mo, which includes a modem rental (no separate item for it on business class)."

There are other subreddits that are dedicated to solving real life mysteries like this. I used them to help a friend decipher what a loved one's suicide note said, it was good to get some closure.  Other subreddits for unsolved mysteries: /r/RBI  /r/unresolvedmysteries  /r/missingpersons"
Boise,3chubm,abnorml1,2,Wed Jul 8 13:28:19 2015 UTC,"No relation, just interested in the case and had read about it on /r/UnresolvedMysteries a while back. I had posted a question about it on another sub and another user who was familiar with the case saw it recently and commented. He/she said they weren't sure if anyone in Meridian had been shown a photo. I saw that Meridian was close to Boise and figured I'd give it a go posting about it here. Thanks for the info."
Boise,3chubm,abnorml1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:45:58 2015 UTC,Where are you located?  I wonder if any detectives here have contacted any of the Steviks in town? You'd think if they had that info would've made public. Where did he get this name? Maybe he was a friend of a Stevik? So very strange. I also found it interesting that this occurred just a few days after 911. I wonder if this had anything to do with his state of mind? It was a pretty emotional time for all.
Boise,3chubm,abnorml1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:50:50 2015 UTC,"I live in another state...just posting here b/c Boise looks close to Meridian on the map. I've read some of the police reports on the case and they did get some names of Steviks in Meridian and did talk to the wife of one guy but didn't read where they sent a photo.  I think I did read somewhere in the reports that his autopsy photos were sent to Meridian PD but don't know if they took them around to other Steviks in the area. To me, that would have been the next logical step. I mean where did he pull that name, town and address from? Seems like there would be a connection.   Here's some police reports and some more."
Boise,3chubm,abnorml1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:03:50 2015 UTC,The autopsy picture is so clear. I think if the picture simply was passed around more on social networks someone would recognize him.
Boise,3chubm,EugeneBYMCMB,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:09:05 2015 UTC,I agree. Even with a suspected 40 lb weight loss I'd hope the photo would be recognizable to someone who knew him.
Boise,3chubm,abnorml1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:25:26 2015 UTC,"I just went through all of the police reports. So he was moved from one room to another because he complained of the noise. He could have left something in the first room. Probably didn't mention it as it seemed that he was already planning to commit suicide. Whatever he left in the first room was probably thrown away by a maid. Another thing I noticed- the coroner said that there were recent marks on his knuckles like he had been in a fight recently. Maybe he was just released from prison? Yeah, we all know most inmates have tattoos but maybe it was his first time in or he wasn't a career criminal. It would explain not having a tan. Who knows? I'm especially interested in this case because personally, this is almost exactly how one of my own close relatives went out- suicide in a motel. He of course was identified but seeing the police reports for Lyle makes me think of going through my own relative's police report- every single detail means something."
Boise,3chubm,abnorml1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:37:59 2015 UTC,I also saw where someone wrote on one of the papers that there were a lot of Steviks in South Dakota. The user I was talking with said the police did do a search of 'Lyle Stevik' in that state with no results found.

It's unbelievable to me how many of these places are around, and how many people actually use them.   They are for extreme emergencies only. Here's a tip: don't use them, and they'll go out of business and go away."

Boise,3cfs59,encephlavator,3,Tue Jul 7 16:31:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly. People out there use them as ""I want a new TV"" emergencies."
Boise,3cfs59,darkstar999,2,Tue Jul 7 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"I wish you were kidding. I worked at one of these places about ten years ago, and we were right next to a rent a center.

Boise,3cfs59,Brobocop,2,Tue Jul 7 16:58:21 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, I wonder what the default rate is? Couple that with small loans then the only way they could stay in business is high fees or huge volume."
Boise,3cfs59,Brobocop,2,Tue Jul 7 21:12:02 2015 UTC,"They find out when the borrower gets paid and make sure that they take the payment as soon as possible. This reduces the default rate (over just hoping that they send in a payment on their own will), but there is nothing stopping the borrower from closing the checking account or changing their direct deposit.  The interest rate is crazy high because it has to be. The borrower has proven in the past that they are bad with borrowed money, so the lender makes up for it in interest/fees."
Boise,3cfs59,wrathofkahn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:57:25 2015 UTC,"My ex wife used to do that. I found out right before we split that she just went down Chinden and Fairview one day and hit every one of them she could, getting every piece of cash she could.   Then went straight to the bank and closed our checking account. Took me years to get myself cleansed of that."
Boise,3cfs59,Brobocop,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:32:57 2015 UTC,I talked to a friend today that said her husband took out a payday loan to keep himself out of jail (behind on child support payments) He defaulted on the loan.

Boise,3cfs59,darkstar999,2,Tue Jul 7 21:20:57 2015 UTC,And Rent-a-Center is almost as bad. They must put them next to each other because only stupid people go into either (for the most part).

Boise,3cc00v,torgoatwork,3,Mon Jul 6 21:54:54 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily true. Some of the best role-players I know are newbies. Are you willing to invest time? Do you mind being a bit foolish? Can you invest yourself in a character and think from a viewpoint not your own? That's what makes a good role-player. Anyone can learn to play, few can learn to be someone else for a few hours."
Boise,3cc00v,NoOnesPrey,3,Mon Jul 6 22:12:23 2015 UTC,I think you make a good point.  I would say that I understand the basics of characterization and motivations from my love of film.  However about the only fantasy game I've really every played/got into much is Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.   I'd really need a course in terminology and rules (etc) to be a useful member of the group.    I would hate to hold everyone else back because I was still trying to wrap my head around how many sides were on the dice.
Boise,3cc00v,torgoatwork,5,Mon Jul 6 22:24:05 2015 UTC,I have never met a role player worth his salt who wasn't patient with new players. The only way to pass on the wisdom of elder players is to teach new people the tricks you've learned. Everyone was a beginner at one point and I guarantee I have done dumber things as a new player than most ever will. I understand some trepidation when starting for the first time but most good players are going to be the best people you could ever meet. Jump in a enjoy!
Boise,3cc00v,NoOnesPrey,3,Tue Jul 7 00:01:42 2015 UTC,Don't sweat it. You'd have all the basics down in a single session.
Boise,3cc00v,torgoatwork,2,Mon Jul 6 22:27:31 2015 UTC,Not at all! I'll teach you the rules and you'll learn to implement them as you play. Other than that all that is required is an open mind :) You don't need to provide anything as I have all the materials necessary.
Boise,3cc00v,torgoatwork,2,Mon Jul 6 22:17:48 2015 UTC,When do you normally do your games/how long do they last?
Boise,3cc00v,NoOnesPrey,2,Mon Jul 6 22:26:39 2015 UTC,"Usually weekend games, but the day we play would be dependent upon the availability of the players. That goes for playtime as well as I've had sessions that run from 3 hours to 8 hours. Just depends on how long people feel like playing."

Hope you find a good group! Anyone who's thinking about it, it really is the best version of the game. I was able to jump right in with no experience and have a blast as an 18-year-old college chick with my thief character, even though she did shoot her mouth off to the wrong overlord, had her face branded, and permanently lost some charisma as a result.

I tend to stick with the more Indie systems, but that's largely because I'm a lazy DM, and the less minutiae I need to care about the better. It's a different story as a player.   That said... I'm still not sure I understand THAC0, and I know I don't know all the rules."
Boise,3cc00v,Explosive_Crab_Farts,2,Tue Jul 7 04:14:38 2015 UTC,"Standard would be whatever works for everyone playing. THACO is simple. Subtract the targets AC from your THACO and roll above that to hit. For example, my THACO is 20, the the targets AC is 7, I need to roll a 13 to hit. Edit* too many to's"

Boise,3c3x3k,Tweakers,6,Sat Jul 4 19:57:59 2015 UTC,"There's no possible way Boise could ban cars in the area. BSU is such a large commuter school that it wouldn't be feasible, plus that section of Broadway is one of the busiest street sections in all of Boise."
Boise,3c3x3k,djtai6,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:56:30 2015 UTC,"The trick is to allow parking at the periphery of an area, but not within it, so people can drive close to the destination but not completely to it. This greatly reduces congestion.  The simple reality is that the larger an area gets -- like the BSU area -- the worse the congestion gets until a point is reached where any driving is much slower than walking or biking, vehicle pollution is horrible and road rage incidents explode. I've seen this in California and Oregon and it will happen here too unless steps are taken to severely limit motor vehicle access to high population areas like BSU. Either get the vehicles completely out of the picture or find some way to make driving to the destination extremely unpleasant (no parking, narrow one-way streets, etc.) because otherwise it is a sure bet that in the near future these steps will have to be taken anyway due to the unworkable nature of too much vehicular traffic in too small an area."
Boise,3c3x3k,Tweakers,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:14:05 2015 UTC,"I'd be fully on board with nuking road traffic between the stadium to capital, and the stadium to beacon.

Boise,3c3x3k,djtai6,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:31:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the big downside of haphazard, seat-of-the-pants city planning which apparently has been a Boise tradition since inception. Just letting things happen as they will is a great recipe for a real mess. At some point in the future someone will have the great pleasure of trying to fix all the transportation messes in the U.S. and I personally hope it is the elimination or severe restriction of motor vehicles. It would be nice to not have the constant noise and stink associated with our current transport options. Odd isn't it; that's what people used to say about horses."
Boise,3c3x3k,Tweakers,2,Sun Jul 5 00:26:56 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your point of view but it's probably unrealistic to eliminate the motor vehicle. If you mean internal combustion engine then yeah, the personal private auto being driven less than say, 100 miles a day doesn't need a gas burning engine. We already have the tech to do this, more or less.  But only with a highly industrial society can we colonize  Mars and ensure our species can survive non manmade catastrophes like a meteor strike or Siberian traps level volcanism or a Yellowstone blowup."
Boise,3c3x3k,encephlavator,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:47:29 2015 UTC,"It is unrealistic to ban cars, but it's not unrealistic to treat them appropriately for the area - as BSU/downtown densifies, policies will force cars to travel slower and defer to the more appropriate biking and walking options for a dense area."

Boise,3br3w3,abnorml1,6,Wed Jul 1 13:53:53 2015 UTC,"So few understand what ""refugee"" status means, how it's obtained and the world they left (not to mention the trauma) before arriving here.   Around 1% (roughly 104,000 of the 10.4 million refugees in camps) actually make it to the U.S. every year. The rest end up spending their lives there.  Why people think this is some sort of ""fast-track"" for people to get to the U.S. is beyond me. It's hardly an efficient way to get terrorists in . . .  References: UNHCR refers only about 1 percent of all refugees for resettlement in a third country.  Only when all efforts to either help refugees return home or settle permanently in the country of asylum have failed does third country resettlement become the option of last resort.  The following countries have resettlement programs: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.  Other countries accept individual refugees on an ad hoc basis.  Family ties, trade skills, professional abilities, language facility, and various other factors are considered by UNHCR when matching a refugee with a resettlement country."
Boise,3br3w3,j_macd,-9,Wed Jul 1 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"Think about this: You have a house full of your own family. A couple of people in your family are unemployed. You're having a hard time feeding your own family, when a government official comes to your door and says, ""We are requiring you to take in 2 more people. You have no choice. Good day. I SAID GOOD DAY!!!!"" And then he leaves and you have to figure out how to feed and clothe 2 more people.   This is what is happening to America right now. Taking racism completely out of the picture and making it a purely economic issue, we are having a hard time feeding our own right now. My parents are both immigrants but came to this country with white collar skills and took no welfare. They didn't need a refugee center. THOSE types of immigrants work for our country right now, not the kind that will take and cannot pay their own way.   I know this is harsh but it's a harsh world we live in now."
Boise,3br3w3,TuffAdams,8,Wed Jul 1 20:27:16 2015 UTC,Pretty sad that you have those thoughts while being a 1st generation immigrant. What if the US wasn't so nice to your parents?
Boise,3br3w3,darkstar999,6,Wed Jul 1 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"Immigration and refugees are two different things. One does not wake up one day and say ""I'm going to be a refugee."" It's done to avoid persecution.  The purpose of these refugee centers is to teach them how to adapt and make it on their own (after overcoming the trauma related from leaving abandoning their lives in the country of origin) with job training, language training, etc.  RECAP: Refugees = people who flee from a war-zone Immigrants = people going somewhere else  Immigration (though really has nothing to do with the original post) should also be broken down to groups: legal and illegal. The United States admits between 700,000 to 900,000 legal immigrants each year, while 700,000 new illegals enter each year.   I admit, I put immigration and refugees in the same bucket until I learned what a refugee really was. I also recognize that more people added to a system that don't contribute to the system is not a good thing (see illegal immigration.)"

Minneapolis grew far richer culturally from taking in refugees from many different countries, including most famously Hmong (which I do realize are an ethnicity and not a country), people from the former Yugoslavia in the early 90s, and Somalia.

There are plenty of homogenous nations which are doing quite well and are ""rich"" to use your word. Japan, So. Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and probably a few more.

Boise,3br3w3,LobsterLoo,6,Thu Jul 2 06:50:07 2015 UTC,"So, you may be surprised to see this, but I actually tracked down the article in the 2007 volume of the journal Scandinavian Political Studies. (It isn't called ""Downside of Diversity"", by the way, it's called ""E Pluribus Unum: Diversity and Community in the Twenty-first Century"". The article you linked is simply a review of said piece, which is a lecture.)  It is indeed written by a liberal (gasp!) political scientist, but it is not as ""Diversity is bad"" as the impression I got from your post.   From the article:   In the long run immigration and diversity are likely to have important cultural, economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits. In the short run, however, immigration and ethnic diversity tend to reduce social solidarity and social capital. New evidence from the US suggests that in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods residents of all races tend to ‘hunker down’. Trust (even of one’s own race) is lower, altruism and community cooperation rarer, friends fewer. In the long run, however, successful immigrant societies have overcome such fragmentation by creating new, cross-cutting forms of social solidarity and more encompassing identities. Illustrations of becoming comfortable with diversity are drawn from the US military, religious institutions, and earlier waves of American immigration.   This is a direct quote from the first paragraph of the piece. So, according to Putnam's findings, diversity is bad in the short term. People need time to adjust. But in the medium to long term it's better. Here is the full text of the piece."
Boise,3br3w3,wrathofkahn,-2,Thu Jul 2 13:54:27 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I fully read either the review or the study and a while since I've debated it. But as I recall, it's easy for either side of the debate to cherry pick, which is what you just did.  I don't have time to go into a full on debate but what bugs me is people who blindly go on about diversity as if it's some miracle panacea. It's a complex issue and there are downsides.

Boise,3br3w3,LobsterLoo,7,Thu Jul 2 16:54:08 2015 UTC,"I'm downvoting you because you're ignorant to what refugees are. Your desire to be surrounded by only white people outweighs your desire to help people who really need it.  If it somehow isn't racist, it's selfish, and it's not a belief I want in my community.  This isn't a debate on the impacts of diversity. Even the group in the article can only complain that they might accept radicals. Even if you're completely correct, which you aren't, it doesn't matter, as refugee programs exist to save lives- not for ""diversity""."

Boise,3br3w3,janicuda,11,Thu Jul 2 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"At first I thought you might be joking but upon reading through your comment history it became clear that you're being serious. Your posts are littered with racist or at least xenophobic remarks.  I know there's nothing anybody could say that would convince you to change your beliefs, but I think it's important you don't affirm these beliefs in others.  It's ridiculous in 2015 to assert that diversity is the cause of crime. The way you put 'refugee centers' in quotes is despicable as it undermines both the suffering that leads refugees here and the help our refugee centers provide to people in need.  The refugees accepted into Idaho   are screened prior to entry are deported if they commit crimes are selected based on their capacity to assimilate (ie, immigrants that speak English are often selected first) are not illegal immigrants   Our country is magnificent and we are morally obligated to help people who are suffering, regardless of nationality or race.  The painful irony is that your beliefs and people who hold them contribute to the crime problem. By systemically ostracizing groups of people based on race and nationality, you create problems that have been proven time and time again to cause crime:   children in poverty unemployment inequality   Like some of your other posts say, you can look to Los Angeles to see the impact of these problems on a community. You just have to look past race to see it.  I know that sometimes it's hard to be trusting and compassionate towards others, and I know that lots of research exists connecting the dots between immigrants as a whole and crime. But these people in refugee centers are not the same as illegal aliens. Grouping them together hurts innocent refugees and, in ten years, hurts everyone else.  If you live in Boise, I would love for you to volunteer at the refugee center with me. I can show you the ropes and you won't have to do it alone. It's an experience I think that anyone would benefit from."

Boise,3bmsat,SagebrushID,14,Tue Jun 30 14:06:01 2015 UTC,I like how easily the government raises taxes to keep up with the times and inflation... but trying to increase the minimum wage in this state is like pulling teeth.
Boise,3bmsat,SqueezyCheez85,2,Tue Jun 30 15:28:38 2015 UTC,It would have been nice to have a 1 cent raise every 3 years instead of this sudden increase of 7 cents I think.
Boise,3bmsat,HiccupMaster,5,Tue Jun 30 16:43:54 2015 UTC,"I like how easily the government raises taxes to keep up with the times and inflation...     It actually wasn't easy for them to raise the gas tax and car registration fees. Doing these things raises less than $100 million for road maintenance. There is still an unmet annual need of hundreds of millions of dollars for maintaining our roads.     but trying to increase the minimum wage in this state is like pulling teeth.     The real problem isn't the minimum wage, it's the increasing wealth disparity gap. Raising the minimum wage does not solve this problem and it may make it worse.    I'll use McDonalds as an example: If they have to pay their workers more, then they will pass that cost onto their customers, and/or hire fewer employees. Many of their customers are poor/middle class people and will now have a negative effect on them since they will have to pay more for these goods/services. The overall effect on the workers is probably negligible since some will make more money while others will lose their job.    What needs to happen is redistributing money/wealth from the top 0.1% to the poor/middle classes. But, this is a much harder problem to solve..."
Boise,3bmsat,crazyk4952,2,Tue Jun 30 18:57:18 2015 UTC,I'm really late to this but how would they redistribute the money? Like what would motivate the rich people to actually give their money to the poor/middle classes?
Boise,3bmsat,CellarDoor8737,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:02:58 2015 UTC,It would probably have to be done through taxes. The resources could then be used to fund various social programs.
Boise,3bmsat,crazyk4952,0,Wed Jul 1 14:12:11 2015 UTC,"I mean the 1% had to work hard to get to where they are. I'm not saying they are doing the most awesome things with their money, but I also don't think redistribution is the answer. I think people need to get off their couches and work. We need to actually have a rigorous school system in which we have the students that are more hands on working towards a trade or skills job rather than having them learn something pointless. And students that excel at sciences, arts, or other are able to pursue those interests to a higher degree. We only see this separation happen in college. For those students who aren't continuing to College, they go learn a trade, or, in the worst case, they just end up mooching off their parents and the system. This isn't producing the people we need to be a part of this economy. It is extremely frustrating that as a student I find fellow college students are not able to figure out what they want to do in life and end up either dropping out or doing an extra few years and obtaining some more debt to finally figure out what they want to do. Even then those students don't like the job environment they end up entering and go find other pursuits. This is the fundamental error with today's generation, they aren't looking for something to pursue, they are just interested with the stuff that meets their needs here and now. We don't think long term and we don't work hard when we need to. This is extremely troubling since this will only be amplified by future generations.   The increasing disparity will only continue through the system you have suggested. By what means can you define 0.1% of the population as the wealthiest. What if they only have $10,000 in their bank accounts with the rest in their various ventures and stocks. How would you tax that? Through income? What if they have their income go through their company and invest in other companies or ventures. This then becomes the wealth of the current Executives and some minor bonuses to their employees.  Having a flat tax might also help. The middle class isn't able to invest in the system as much as they'd like because they are taxed upwards of 30-35% on their income. That's troubling indeed when you take into account that right the 0.1% is being taxed hugely right now and they are still living comfortably, so obviously this doesn't fix the issue.  The tax system is broken as of now, there are too many loopholes in place that allow the rich to get away with being greedy. Simplifying the system is really the best option to fixing taxes."

Boise,3bmsat,Sterling_____Archer,2,Tue Jun 30 21:54:57 2015 UTC,"That was my thought at first too. But electric cars are increasing in number. If they don't use gas, they pay no gas tax. If they pay no gas tax, they aren't paying their fair share for road maintenance. So the burden falls on those who drive regular cars. Since electric cars tend to be pretty expensive, (for now) the only people driving them tend to be well to do. So as the burden shifts to gasoline car drivers, it also shifts more to lower income folks. And that is called a regressive tax, where the poor pay a higher percent than the rich. By making electric car drivers pay an additional fee, it is leveling the playing field, and making sure everyone pays for the roads they use.  Regressive tax aside, what happens when 30% of the cars on the road are electric? Them roads gotta be paid for somehow.  Honestly though I'm not sure the fear of a regressive was the Legislature's actual reasoning. Looking out for lower income folks isn't really their thing. The Idaho Legislature likes to make laws just to give the finger to things they don't like. In this case, environmentalists."

Boise,3bibam,biochromatic,4,Mon Jun 29 13:32:11 2015 UTC,"Has anybody started a business (specifically an LLC) in Idaho? I did a google search and got tons of results from companies offering to help start an LLC for a cost, but it seems like most of that help is unnecessary.  If you've started an LLC in Idaho, what was the process like for you?"
Boise,3bibam,janicuda,3,Wed Jul 1 21:26:38 2015 UTC,"If its going to have several members and employees, then its better to hire an attorney to get everything in shape. If its just a single member LLC, then get an accountant to get your books in order and help with tax issues, and you can probably do it on your own through the Secretary of State website. Alternatively, if you are a woman, you can check http://wbcidaho.org/.  OR you can also call the small business clinic at U of I Law school in Boise and they can possibly help you when school starts up again, if you want to wait."

You can print the registration form and mail it or take it to the Secretary of State office downtown.  LLC registration is $100 to file.  If it's a single member,  you don't need an EIN. But why bother with an LLC if you are using your own SSN? If you want to use your own SSN,  just get an assumed business name (it's only $25!)  Best idea,  come see me at Mountain West Bank and I'll help you register for an EIN, get your paperwork filled out, and get a cashiers check for the fee. We have Totally Free Business Checking and you get a free gift.  Is a minimum  $50 opening deposit but there is no minimum balance requirement.  I cannot help with tax issues.  If this is something your business needs assistance with,  please see a professional.  But I'm more than happy to hello with the above items.  I'm in my office 9-5, Monday to Friday.  Please come by 4:30 if we are setting up am EIN and all that,  though.    EDIT:  I wanted to add that if this is a larger endeavor,  once you have consulted the Small Business Development Center at boise State5and have a business plan,  I'd be more than happy to set you up with an SBA officer who can guide you through that lending process if need be."

I feel much safer on Hill Road, anywhere from the North End to Gary Lane, than the green belt. I love the GB but it's the only place that worries me during off hours. Hill has sidewalks, good visibility with proximity to homes, and traffic. I'd recommend it as an alternative. I live in the area and frequently am out there at 530 am. Nothing but other runners and bikers and the occasional car. No hidey-holes for raper guys.  Even the foothill trails accessible from Hill have foot traffic at that time."
Boise,3baruj,whyyes-yesiam,6,Sun Jun 28 04:08:32 2015 UTC,I'd suggest a buddy. Can you borrow someone's dog? I know solitary running is incredibly therapeutic so your buddy doesn't have to be a person who may flake on you or run at a different pace etc. If someone has a dog you can run with (possibly an older person who has a dog in need of exercise?) that would keep you safer.

Luckily there's only a few areas that are sketch, under the broadway bridge for one, also on the far west portion of ann morrison park, which i believe is because of the high homeless rate over off of Americana.

Boise,3baruj,encephlavator,5,Sat Jun 27 21:51:02 2015 UTC,Short answer: No.   The odds are long against anything happening but consider the consequences. Compare it to golfing or doing anything outdoors in a lightning storm.  I can't remember any recent assaults but in the late 90s early 00s there were 3 different rape/murders between Julia Davis Park and the Main St Bridge.  /end your dad's lecture  Kay Lynn Jackson Apr98; Samantha Maher July00; Lynn Henneman Sep00

I would take at least a dog, but run with someone else of you could. I think it's safe, but I'm a tall guy, not going to be a target. I have gotten spooked a few times, and I think it's probably worth your time to run with a buddy. However, the ymca opens at five am as well, and that's a pretty popular  safe option too."

I wouldn't say it's safer to run on main roads, though, simply due to the risk of being struck by a car (I may have an overblown fear of being stuck by cars, though, because in another city I was hit by +/- fourteen different cars as a pedestrian). Jogging on the Greenbelt, you want to be visible at a distance as a hard target. Your safest bet is to find a jogging buddy. If you have to jog alone, do not wear haedphones and look around as you jog, not just straight ahead at the trail. This shows anyone casing you that you are alert and will likely notice them earlier than would be ideal for them. Keep your cell phone in a visible location like on an armband. This shows that you have the ability to contact other people quickly, and a disruption to your routine might be noticed immediatly. Carry a weapon in a visible location, even if it's not one you intend to use to identify yourself as someone who will fight back if attacked. If the weapon you have on display is not one you intend to use, carry a secondary weapon you do intend to use. I recommend carrying a baton (which is readily identifiable as a weapon and has a high intimidation factor and ease of use) or a jogger style pepper spray that straps to your hand and keeps it in the ready position."

Boise,3baruj,themeec,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:54:03 2015 UTC,"As someone who's lived on the Greenbelt for 7 years, and the one time something bad happened to me was in broad daylight right in the 9th street tunnel, it's hard to say. People would say ""Oh you should have had a gun/mace/etc"" ... it wouldn't have done fuck all, in fact probably made it worse in the end.   That being said. If running at 5AM, it's a bit of a different scenario, as you're already going to be more alert to things around you. I would definitely recommend carrying a defensive weapon of some sort, be it lethal or non. Be aware of your surroundings at all times (aka, don't wear headphones).   Chances are in this town, absolutely nothing will happen to you at all. But in the one-in-a-zillion chance that something does, like in my case, it can't hurt to be prepared."

Boise,3b7bal,encephlavator,10,Fri Jun 26 15:32:52 2015 UTC,"Did you read Otter's statement about it? Still hatin'  Governor Otter just issued the following statement about the Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states.  “Today’s decision is truly disappointing for states, including Idaho, where the people chose to define marriage for themselves as between one man and one woman. I have maintained from the very beginning that it should be the prerogative of the states – not the courts – to determine whether same-sex marriage is consistent with the values, character, and moral fabric of that particular state. That is why it was especially troubling that the Court treated the 10th Amendment as a footnote, instead of the guiding principle our founding fathers intended.”"

The law is based in morality but only in so much that it tries at it's best on a personal level to prevent actions that harm someone else's person or property, or at least that's what I thought libertarian views were supposed to be.  A true liberal view would ban the state from getting involved in marriage (with it's religious heritage) at all.  Civil unions for all and then get married where you want."

Boise,3b9zlg,Chelonia_mydas,3,Sat Jun 27 05:27:06 2015 UTC,"Just look for 3 bedroom in your price range. Make sure you can all come up with first and last month's rent so when you want to get the apt. the landlord knows that you're financially prepared. If you can show that you've been working a certain job for a while, that helps also since they want to make sure you'll pay your rent on time. Often you will have to get one of your parents to co-sign considering your age and lack of credit history. A condo / Apt will be cheaper than a house. Yes a house is ideal, but houses have LOTS of extra costs that apts don't.

Boise,3am66k,jaxxex,6,Tue Jun 23 20:59:50 2015 UTC,"I'm probably going to get hate for this, but one way to not get tailgated is to not block the flow of traffic. Unless you intend to pass, and especially if you intend to drive 5 or even 10 mph under the limit, then stay to the right. When I took drivers ed, I was taught it's nearly as dangerous to make yourself an obstacle by driving too slow in busy traffic as it is to drive too fast. I do not tailgate, myself, nor do I endorse it, nor do I seek to justify the behavior, but while I was born in Idaho I have lived elsewhere, and I believe many Idaho drivers to need to be more considerate to those driving behind them."
Boise,3am66k,ifixpedals,2,Mon Jun 22 01:39:14 2015 UTC,"I should clarify and it's why I mentioned the construction zone. 1) lowered speed limit so law abiders are going to go slower 2) narrowed lanes no shoulder no escape route, i.e., it's more dangerous than normal, hence the lowered speed limit  I want to pass the slow driving person in the left lane in front of me TOO. Tailgating me isn't going to make me pull over to let the tailgater by nor is it going to make the person in front of me go faster.   But the real issue was the tailgater to the right of me and in front of me. They were so close, that if the person in front had had a flat or simply applied his brakes the tailgater was likely to cause an accident and take me out too. IOW, it's not the tailgating per se, it's the potential for a accident delaying me our taking me out."
Boise,3am66k,ifixpedals,-1,Mon Jun 22 13:41:21 2015 UTC,"My comment wasn't directly to you, but rather toward a trend I see in many Idaho drivers...

This is exactly why I started this thread.  Anyway you are wrong. In the construction zone, which is posted 50 or 55, I was stuck behind a semi in the left lane. Obviously he's not changing lanes, he can't there's cars in the right lane matching his speed.   So some jackass is less than one car length behind me, and I'm leaving 2 car lengths between me and the semi. FFS, I want to pass that piece of shit semi too. Tailgating me is not going to make the semi in front of me go any damn faster.   Don't get me wrong it doesn't really bother me. What bothers me is the jackass passes on the right, tailgates the person in the right lane next to me and the semi. I mean less than one car length. Now the issue is if something happens in front of me or next to me I don't want a wreck taking me out or delaying me.  FWIW, I witnessed that wreck on the outbound connector couple weeks ago. I was inbound and saw a semi hit the skids, rear end 5 cars and nearly come through into my lanes which would have killed me. I was only saved by the jersey barrier. There was no time to react.

In some ways the traffic is better. Or the roads are better. Many west Boise roads have been widened in the last 10 years and I84 and I184.

Now that I am right beside him, I might as well not go anywhere at all, making a lane change impossible!""  On the other hand, there are the drivers that are so obsessed with being courteous to everyone else that they themselves become a traffic hazard.  The other day some jackass was trying to jaywalk across 4 lanes of state street during rush hour, some asshole in the inner lane decided it would be a good idea to come to a dead stop and hope all the other lanes would follow suit, just so some pedestrian douche won't have to walk the extra 20 feet to the crosswalk.

And some of the biggest cocksuckers on the road are on bicycles, a good majority have this idea that because the are on a bike, they have a free license to go wherever they want in whatever matter they want. On a nightly basis I see cyclists without headlamps or reflectors riding in the middle of poorly lit streets.  Honestly, the transportation culture here needs a swift kick in the ass and an understanding that contrary to their staunchly held belief that they are better than the surrounding cities and states around them, they are actually quite shit.  I think when the majority of this town gets off their shit crafted pedestals when it comes to transportation, we can actually make some progress here. But as of now, Boise has some of the worse commuters I have ever dealt with.  And on with the downvotes."
Boise,3am66k,Oldschool64bus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:45:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, I bike a lot (FYI I do use headlamps etc.).  I Appreciate the thought when someone stops at a cross street (usually N. End) and lets me go, but this is not the way it's supposed to be done.  I have a stop sign, I'm expecting traffic to continue and then I'll go when it's gone, just like a car.  It actually throws me off a bit when someone stops and I worry about the car behind them that's not expecting them to stop, do I really want to be out in front of that car that stopped.  You are spot on on the biking cocksuckers.  Bikers that break the rules piss me off.  They make it more dangerous for people that actually follow the rules.  You see assholes on bikes going the wrong way down one-way streets, or just charging through intersections without stopping (even the correct Idaho Stop)."

Stopping and waving someone across is actually more dangerous in some situations especially when there's 2 or more lanes in one direction. The do-gooder's car, if it's a pickup or SUV, is now blocking the view of the adjacent lane.  There was a huge thread on /r/portland about a year ago regarding this issue."

Boise,3abxan,darkstar999,3,Thu Jun 18 21:15:04 2015 UTC,"They have the potential to offer such great summer activities. Tamarack, Brundage, and Jug mountain have all been pushing their summer activities like crazy (more Brundage and Jug the last few years. Tamarack seems to be getting it back together this year) and have completely left Bogus in the summer dust.   As much as I would like to say ""eff off"" to the dbag that is the head of bogus, I still think it's important to voice real opinions because it has such great potential.   If there was a real, well maintained, and thought out trail system I would way rather drive 40min to the top of bogus than almost two hours to get to Jug or Brundage.  If they ran shuttles and lifts consistently I would easily tack on 50-100 bucks for a ""summer/winter"" pass."

I know Bogus staff can't do much about it, but if I had God-like-powers the first thing I would do, would be to dump snow all over the mountain first thing in the winter.  This survey seems to be fishing for interest of how much people want summer activities up there and if it's worth it for Bogus staff to put their money and effort into it."
Boise,3abxan,Whitebeard,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:34:47 2015 UTC,"Their trails are OK at best. I'm still surprised they let g19 stay which is pretty cool.  If they really pushed trails there is no way riders wouldnt be up there. There is a reason Jug sells out their shuttle spots every week, which is an amazing trail system. Bogus has the potential and the terrain to compete directly with Jug and Brundage. They just need people that actually know how a trail system should work. One way trails would be a start to getting some riders up there. I guess you could count g19 as one way but it's not marked at all."
Boise,3abxan,panda_foo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:42:39 2015 UTC,I'm a novice mountain biker and I know they have lots of great trails up there on the road up to Bogus. But I literally know nothing about the summer facilities up there. They probably need to advertise it better.
Boise,3abxan,Whitebeard,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:54:06 2015 UTC,"A lot of that seemed to be because of the former Dbag head of Bogus.   If you, even as a novice rider, went up to jug mountain and road their trail system you would absolutely have a ""well why the hell doesnt bogus have something like this?"" realization.   Bogus has some good trails, but that is different than a good trail system. To be fair though they probably have wayyy more hurdles to jump between the forest service, swimba, and other outdoors/trail organizations. Jug is privately owned land so say they can kinda just say ""eff it! lets build a new trail"" if they want."
Boise,3abxan,panda_foo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:50:22 2015 UTC,"The majority of bogus paying guests are families aged ~4-14 and 27-45.   The terrain park crowd is not the core business.  It is a distraction from what the company should be focused on.  Truth is bogus can never be a terrain park resort with out millions in snow making facilitates/ponds/water rights which just isn't going to happen. While summer ops seems like a good idea, using unused resources, the costs of summer operations in no way make up for revenue.   Due to:  The #1 problem, after snow fall, and one that is not going to get solved is,  the road. Bogus is at the end of a curvy 16 mile road that people are afraid to drive in the summer.  It is a singular destination with limited services.   If you look at the ski industry the places that are making money make almost all the profit from ancillary services of lodging, food and entertainment."

Boise,3a71xm,greyspectre2100,5,Wed Jun 17 20:43:01 2015 UTC,"I thought that number seemed abnormally high till I read this article, it looks like $50 million per mile is about as cheap as it gets for a light rail, and I would guess the Boise area would probably be pretty low, maybe around $60-70million a mile; so 6-8 miles of line would cost up to one billion, that is around $650 dollars for every Idaho citizen."
Boise,3a71xm,Bennyboy1337,6,Wed Jun 17 21:58:46 2015 UTC,We could probably land some federal grants. But everyone in Idaho outside of the treasure valley would be totally against it.

The real thing is a project like this would probably pay for itself over that 20 year period, then save the state/cities money in the long run."

Boise,3a71xm,Nichijo,4,Sun Jun 21 01:21:44 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Still, you have to wonder how much pollution and time cost is caused by the constant traffic jam on the freeway each morning and evening versus a billion dollars of infrastructure development, especially in an era where they're purposely trying to squeeze car commuters out of the downtown core without genuinely good public transit options to make up the difference.  Run a light rail line between Mountain Home and Caldwell, improve the bus service so that there are reliable, later, and Sunday options, and the gridlock will largely relieve itself. Then Bieter can have his car-free trolley and bicycle utopia downtown."
Boise,3a71xm,greyspectre2100,3,Wed Jun 17 22:29:23 2015 UTC,"Oh I totally agree, I think the short term cost would be far outweighed by the long term costs savings that type of project would have. Imagine an electric rail line that cuts traffic by 1/3rd on the Y, decreases pollution, accidents, wear on roads, decreases the demand for parking which increase the space for parks, and businesses! Seems like a no brainer to me, but we forgot about the majority that runs this state."
Boise,3a71xm,Bennyboy1337,5,Wed Jun 17 23:10:54 2015 UTC,"Well, we spent probably close to a billion dollars on the interstate 84 expansion in the last several years,  so it's less an issue of money and more of collective priority. To be fair, a large chunk was paid with GARVEE money, which I think can only be used for highways."
Boise,3a71xm,neerok,5,Wed Jun 17 22:35:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, GARVEE is only for highways. They're bonds backed by the promise of future federal highway dollars. There'd have to be some sort of federal grants to get this sort of thing rolling, and even then it'll be a tough sell outside the valley."

Also, as someone who's used the bus system, it really works fine, they just need to extend hours and increase frequency. Money would be better spent there IMO.  EDIT: I think downtown traffic is a huge and growing problem and I think a major source of this issue is local, North End, East End, West Boise, East Boise etc. If public transportation is going to alleviate this problem, they really have to work on making the price cheaper than driving for car owners. Not sure if this is possible but as it stands now, it's not."

Boise,3a71xm,neerok,2,Thu Jun 18 17:28:01 2015 UTC,"Most ACHD funding comes from vehicle related taxes but it does use property taxes too so there is a bit of a subsidy. I think having adequate roadways increases quality of life and I wouldn't be for cuting funding there (Remember, public transportation and bicycles use roads too). I do think increasing subsidies for public transportation would be a good idea though.  Also, I think you'd  garner much more public support with a plan that makes public transportation more attractive rather than a plan that makes driving less attractive."
Boise,3a71xm,dregan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:03:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, more of ACHD funding comes from property taxes than from 'user fees'. It's not 50%, but it's a greater share than gas tax receipts & registration fees combined. The subsidy is much greater than commonly known or accepted. At the federal level (which doesn't really apply to local roads) the picture is even worse.   http://www.achdidaho.org/Departments/Administration/Budget_2015.aspx   I agree with you that garnering support for making driving more expensive is likely to go over like a lead brick, but I also think people are largely unaware of the bigger picture. There isn't an easy solution."
Boise,3a71xm,neerok,3,Thu Jun 18 18:35:30 2015 UTC,"Property taxes represent the largest revenue source for ACHD ($33.2 million), followed by state gas taxes ($21.2 million), development impact fees ($13 million) and vehicle registration fees ($9.2 million).   More people need know that property-tax payers own the road, not just drivers.       Give me my damn bike lanes."

Boise,3a71xm,Nichijo,4,Sun Jun 21 01:19:46 2015 UTC,"I'm coming to Boise from a metro area that has two light rail lines. Minneapolis has a roughly north-south rail line that runs from downtown Minneapolis to the Mall of America 12 miles south, stopping at the airport in between, and a roughly east-west line that runs between downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul. The north-south or Blue line cost $700 million dollars when it was finished in 2004. The east-west or Green line cost $957 million and was completed in 2014, but a third of the Green line runs on existing Blue line track, so a line from scratch would cost even more. A third proposed line to the western suburbs is expected to cost roughly $3 billion. I simply can't imagine Idaho taxpayers spending that kind of money on anything to be honest. Rail is super nice, but it is really, really expensive."

It looks like ValleyRide had total expenses of $13,497,568 in 2014.  $13.5 million divided by 1.2 million rides = a cost of $11.25 per trip taken (per person). Ouch.  If my math sucks...please clue me in."
Boise,3a71xm,jurisnipper,3,Thu Jun 18 01:39:23 2015 UTC,"Not that it matters but it is closer to $9.45. There were 1.4 million rides. The number you looked at was Boise only.   ValleyRide bus services experienced a small dip in ridership during fiscal year 2014 compared to FY 2013. Overall, boardings totaled 1,428,551 compared to 1,450,05 in 20139, a decrease of 1.1 percent.   Also, the interesting thing is they generated less than $1million. Out of the $18.5million in revenue $17.4million were from federal/local grants. That is 94% of all revenue coming from grants."
Boise,3a71xm,liquidburn,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:53:25 2015 UTC,A functional transportation system means more money spent in the city and more employment opportunities. It isn't a wash just because they don't charge enough in bus fare.
Boise,3a71xm,fuckyou_space,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:57:38 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone would dispute that.   A functioning bus system is critical for people who do not have automobiles to get to/from work and life. That's a very important thing for the citizens of Boise to ensure. They're making an investment in the valley's growth and future.
Boise,3a71xm,jurisnipper,3,Thu Jun 18 15:31:55 2015 UTC,"It seems that most of the current ridership of VRT are people that can't afford other means of transportation. So, we are subsidizing their transportation. That's fine, but let's not pretend that we are relieving congestion and getting cars off of the road.    I do not see this changing for the foreseeable future, even with the underground transit thing that is being built downtown.    If we truly want people to use public transit instead of commuting everyday with their car, then we need to have something that is convenient and not dependent on the freeway (i.e. light rail). This is going to take a lot more money than people are willing to spend.    So meanwhile, we'll keep slowly expanding our existing bus system and keep pretending that we are relieving congestion on the freeway. It sounds about par for the course..."

Boise,3a71xm,boisecynic,0,Wed Jun 17 19:02:31 2015 UTC,"From the BW article   However, as the U.S. government continued to subsidize the manufacture and sale of private automobiles, public transportation systems were kicked to the curb, becoming urban ghosts.   Source?  Yeah there were some sleazy deals, notably the LA bus system, but by and large the American public wanted and taxed themselves for an automobile society. Regardless, buses need pavement to drive on too. And right of way. Rail transit, besides actual tracks and r.o.w., has it's own problems, like being unable to make 90º turns like cars. Don't forget rail yards where the trains need to sleep at night, these places are much bigger than people think.   Here's one of SLC's rail yards, Jordan River Service Center. The warehouse alone is 200,000 sq ft, the land must be 24 acres.  Here's another one in SLC, Lovendahl Facility in Midvale. There's a 3rd one called the Warm Springs Operations Center.  It took me hours to track these down because in all of UTA's and Trax's website literature, not once do they mention their ginormous rail yard maintenance and storage facilities."

Buses need pavement and right of way, who pays for that?  We live in a democracy and the people have voted for automobiles and the roads to drive them on. Why is this a problem? Besides pollution including CO, that is. The real issue is population growth. Automobile emissions would probably not be an issue if the human population of Earth was only 100 million."

Boise,39wv2d,dogwitheyebrows,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"i live in eagle so i can attest to this! super yummy coffee and baked goods. maybe not worth the hike from the north end but i'd definitely try to swing by if you're in the area some morning/afternoon. also, if you wanna meet for coffee (there or elsewhere) sometime, i'd totally be down!"
Boise,39wv2d,wrecktonomic,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:16:27 2015 UTC,I'd totally be down to meet up for coffee! Let me know when you're thinking. I picked up an odd-job working a roof in Caldwell so I'm semi-swamped the next couple days but my internship doesn't start for a couple weeks so I'm trying to explore as much as I can.

Boise,39wv2d,darkstar999,3,Tue Jul 14 00:31:02 2015 UTC,"Are you 100% set on the north end? I live on the East Bench near Vista and Overland, it is almost as good as being downtown.   It's a 15 minute bike ride, $1 bus ride, 10 minute drive, or $10 taxi/uber to get downtown. There are restaurants, bars, groceries, and shopping on Vista within walking/biking distance."
Boise,39wv2d,encephlavator,3,Mon Jun 15 16:43:47 2015 UTC,"You're not here yet? Because driving around looking for signs is as good a method as any. I've seen a few signs in the north end, then checked CL and there was no listing for that address. That's how tight the market is."
Boise,39wv2d,Zipod,2,Mon Jun 15 19:34:06 2015 UTC,The frequency of the question and your experience thus far should give you an idea as to the difficulty in finding a good home in the north end. Very sought after location. Good luck to you.
Boise,39wv2d,raymondio,2,Mon Jun 15 19:23:12 2015 UTC,"Why the north end? It's one of the most sought after communities in the valley. Why not look for something to the west of Boise, put on your commuter shoes, and save some cash? Although, I do know of a small 3-bedroom place going for $1000/month off of 27th street (my buddy just bought house because his landlords raised the rent again.. btw, it's cheaper to own a house).  Just my two cents."
Boise,39wv2d,rhymeswithsarah,2,Mon Jun 15 21:12:58 2015 UTC,"Fair question. We will be working on campus and near the capitol, and it's important to us to to be able to walk/bike commute most of the time. Being relatively young (late 20s, early 30s) and gay, we want to be in a lively progressive neighborhood, not suburbia. We're also not at all interested in the party/undergrad scene on the other side of our work epicenter.   I realize we're limiting our possibilities, but we're only going to be in Boise for three years and want to make the very most of our life here in the heart of the city.   Thanks for your thoughts."
Boise,39wv2d,raymondio,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:30:15 2015 UTC,Well then all you need is to be close to the greenbelt! Check out Garden City stuff (between Boise and Eagle).. most people think it's run down but it's getting very gentrified these days.
Boise,39wv2d,pleen,2,Mon Jun 15 19:42:38 2015 UTC,"Garden City's killing it these days! We have four or five breweries, a ton of wineries have moved in, we have the Visual Arts Collective, The Greenbelt, and if you aren't violating traffic laws our police department doesn't care much what you are up to. We've got Cobby's and the Reuseum and RV's out the wazoo!"
Boise,39wv2d,janicuda,2,Mon Jun 15 19:55:01 2015 UTC,Is this covered in the FAQ? The rental market is incredibly tight and there is little inventory on the market right now.   Can mods do something about people asking for rental help?
Boise,39wv2d,Fly_Caster,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:16:59 2015 UTC,This is exactly why the weekly thread was made in the first place.   Maybe somebody knows a friend that is moving out or a place that will be available in the near future.

Boise,39ukqc,loopsix,3,Sun Jun 14 23:28:52 2015 UTC,This right here.  I saw them a lot in California when I was stationed there. They looked a little less fake and obvious.  Idaho needs to step up its game.
Boise,39ukqc,Carti3r,2,Sun Jun 14 23:34:24 2015 UTC,They have a lot of them back in Arizona too. It's pretty funny to see them because they are cell phone towers disguised as pine trees in the middle of the barren desert where no pine trees can grow. Some of the cell phone towers are better disguised as cactus or palm trees though.

Boise,39ukqc,doteman,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:24:03 2015 UTC,"Don't they have to disguise them? This is definitely not the first disguised tower I've seen locally.   Wasn't there some hassle involving a cell company and the Idaho Shakespeare Festival, for putting a cell tower right in view of the audience in the field behind the stage? And didn't they compromise by disguising it? (because my memory is a swirling fog on that story, but definitely there are other disguised cell towers around and in other countries)"

I'm guessing whoever owns the land is collecting around $2000 a month. They asked me if I wanted it on my property, but since I rent I had to decline. I saw it going up over the last month or so. It just a cell phone tower disguised as a tree. They put the finishing touches on it last week. I thought there would be a nest on top, but it doesn't appear so.   I should have taken pictures in the different stages, but really didn't find it that interesting."
Boise,39ukqc,Fly_Caster,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:10:31 2015 UTC,"That ""old Japanese garden"" -- you mean the defunct plant nursery with the collection of rundown greenhouses? Was it owned by Japanese people?"
Boise,39ukqc,Nichijo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:58:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. I grew up only a few blocks away over forty years ago and still live in the area. I'm not sure when it quit doing business, but I can say it's been at least 6 years, but probably much longer. Last summer there was somebody there cleaning the front area. I'm not sure if she was thinking of reopening it or there just to reminisce. I was told the the original owner/gardener never wanted to sell it and always keep it in the family...I guess the offer was to great for them to pass up.  Hearing stories from my older customers, it was quite the popular place to buy plants back in the day."
Boise,39ukqc,Fly_Caster,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:08:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, I noticed about the same thing, that it appeared that one or two of the greenhouses were in use - but otherwise, I can remember back about 10 or 15 years, and it looked mostly abandoned all that time.   Too bad, I had a friend who was interested, and could have made a go of it, but she wasn't motivated to track down the owners and negotiate. Funny how some people can sweat hard all day doing physical work, but can't seem to force themselves to pick up the phone."
Boise,39ukqc,Nichijo,3,Mon Jun 15 15:42:07 2015 UTC,"Holy hell, I have a friend who never believes me when I say it's a cell tower. Every time we go up the hill he asks me where it is, but he doesn't believe me."

And why does the City of Boise, with all its leash laws, assume people can't control their off leash dogs. Because experience. That's why.  The very fact they're considering a Corgi means it's likely they know little about dogs. But whatever, I'm not holding a gun to their head.

Their breed is considered a stunning success in the dog world.   I'd be wary of dog breeds like designer ""tea-cup"" sized dogs, hunting/working dogs (e.g. labs), and gladiator dog types, before a corgi. Yes, you should always do your homework when looking though.   I'm a big proponent of adoption, as we've adopted quite a few animals. I always say, if you want a specific breed, and you can afford the upkeep (i.e. food, yard, exercise, love, etc) of said breed, go for it."

Wizard's Den and ABU run magic events almost every night and you can pretty much walk into either store at any time and find people to play with. Most other stores run one other event (draft or commander) on one other day of the week in addition to FNM.  For DBZ I'm not aware of any organized events anywhere. So your best bet is going to be to head in to All About Games or Phoenix Fire Games and just ask around about it."

Also I can't afford to be attending drafts or keeping up with Standard. I've got old cards, some dating back to the Ice Age days. Most of my cards were bought between the Onslaught block (I loved those sets) through the Ravnica block. Since then I've bought a few packs here and there, and some singles that caught my attention.  So ""casual"" Legacy is my preferred format. I like the idea of Modern, but there's always some key card that my decks rely on that are not Modern legal.

I now make more than twice what I made at the old job.  And I just applied for a promotion to a position that will bring that up to more than 3x.  Money can't buy happiness, but it can make mildly unpleasant things - like wearing khakis or drinking on your own time - much more palatable."

Boise,39m20a,dregan,2,Sat Jun 13 00:26:59 2015 UTC,Most of the CS students straight from college who stay here in Boise  usually will make 65k-90k a year.  Normally 65-75k if you're straight out of college. This ranges of course depending on what company you work for and how awesome your skills and experience is.  Startups will usually pay less but have better stock options and feel less like corporate.   Source:  I'm a CS graduate

In addition, you get healthcare, 401k matching, etc (maybe even pension as well if you find the right company). Don't dismiss it so easily. I've never worked for any small companies in Boise but I've looked into them and, in my experience, they pay a lot less. I'd look at Healthwise, Clearwater Analytics, and Schweitzer Engineering Labs. They aren't exactly startups but they are smaller and are great places to work from what I've heard. They will probably pay a bit better and be a bit more stable than your average startup too."

Boise,39m20a,netcamps,2,Sat Jun 13 05:29:38 2015 UTC,It would be harder to find a place in Boise that doesn't allow T-shirt and jeans. The beer will be harder to find.

Sometimes the excitement of a running squirrel or another dog keeps them from listening. And as friendly as my dog is. other leashed dogs might get defensive if she comes for an impromptu greeting from a stranger. The kids may come to pet them or scream and the dog may lash out to defend themselves and the situation turns very quickly.

They brought up how lawmakers need to realize that in doing so they also open the doors for all religious text.   Also Raw story writes this pretty biased, the intent of the law (if you trust what they say the intent is not the implications) is to use it as a reference to historical fact. Specifically to help understand the mindset of people in ancient days, and not so much the ""morals"" taught.  It does however reinforce that ""this book is truth"" mentality and I am opposed to that.   In College we read exerpts from the bible as well as other holy texts as a part of a literary analysis class and in discussions on parables. In a context like that (assuming other religions are equally represented) I would not be incredibly upset if only allowed at a HS Senior level."
Boise,39aysy,TheOffTopicBuffalo,4,Wed Jun 10 15:28:44 2015 UTC,"I'll readily concede that some study of various religions belong in history and sociology classes, pointing out their (usually deleterious) affects upon societies, and civilization in general.

When you are ""playing the game"" with people like this, you have to of course realize they are of the opinion that they are bettering the system by including a book of moral standards to the youth.

Boise,39aysy,gdog05,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:01:54 2015 UTC,"You don't fight the belief. Doing so is actually rather cruel. You just work to keep batshit insane people out of power. You CAN promote reason over religion and secularism over theocracy, though."

Boise,39aysy,TheOffTopicBuffalo,3,Wed Jun 10 18:21:07 2015 UTC,"I think we may be talking about two different beliefs. One is the social aspect that religious belief is okay if you don't have it yourself. And being surrounded by it and feeling that you're alone in your lack of religious belief can be modified when you see others promote reason. As well as show how and why religious beliefs can be bad. That is technically fighting belief.   The other is the direct religious belief itself. It's not fightable. And people often cling stronger to their beliefs when you attack the pillars of their belief. By promoting reason, you may allow them to crack those pillars, but you can't do it yourself. It's passive. The outcome might be that they themselves allow it. Some people do react well to being called a dumbass by someone they respect and work on changing their views. It's a smaller percentage, though, and can't be done very well on a larger scale than individually, in my opinion.   I definitely agree that promoting more correct ideas and devaluing wrong ideas are a moral duty and a responsibility. We agree, I think, it's just a small difference in language to me."

I understand it is part of LDS children's school time but/and my question pertains to how the church can incorporate an hour of church into the middle of school hours. I understand that the building is not on school grounds so I'm guessing it has something to do with permission to leave the premises and somehow getting a free hour during school, but these are just theories. I'll hop on over to r/exmormon if needed but this seemed like a place that might know..."

It took up an elective space in the schedule. In the freshman year, kids take it before school starts (zero hour) and they mostly take it release time in high school and may take other classes zero hour so they can take more electives.   I don't know how it plays into rules about curriculum and school hours but it's not an actual elective. It's taught by the LDS church, not the school or school district. Hope this helps."

Boise,396j6i,BoiseWanderlust,5,Tue Jun 9 18:03:12 2015 UTC,"This section of the trail we did was by far the hardest I've ever done. The trail is psychologically defeating by my standards. Generally, you hike up hill to get to a lake or peak, then down to get out.   This trail you hike down, then up, then down, then up, and that's JUST to get to the destination. You repeat it all leaving. You're at like, 7,400 feet at the trailhead, and the lake (basin) is also 7400 feet. So you're like, I dunno. It was rough. To add to this, this trail was extremely under-maintained. A fire had burnt a lot of the trees in the first half, and all throughout there are dozens of fallen trees in the way. Vaulting over them was extremely taxing with full gear. I'm 6 foot 6 and I had plenty of troubles with most of them. You get to the point where you just walk up a steep hill to circumvent most of the trees if you can.   I would reccomend hiking to Imogene lake, or the Petit Toxoway loop (both in Sawtooths) if you want to get a feel for backpacking. they are both like, 20 mile loops with some elevation gain, but it's not so bad.

I've never heard of anyone getting cited for launching from Barber Park when the ordinance is in effect. I don't know how many do it, but I have a few times.  What's going on is news media reporting at the behest of Boise City Hall, making it seem like there's a floating season and non-floating season."
Boise,397fv5,encephlavator,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:44:16 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, that makes more sense. I look forward to floating the river sometime this summer."
Boise,397fv5,doorknob60,4,Tue Jun 9 22:47:03 2015 UTC,And when they make this announcement it also means the Fire department has made a sweep of the river and cleared the snags and debris that have washed down stream over winter and that the flow levels are safe.
Boise,397fv5,smokey_sunrise,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:11:24 2015 UTC,That's true. But what's safe for some is unsafe for others. It all depends on the floater's boat and experience. I've done the river in early May at 5000 cfs where you had to duck your head going under Broadway. And I've seen 10 year olds alone in rafts floating right up against the tree line at 700 cfs.

Boise,396f06,boisecynic,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:17:07 2015 UTC,"Just road over this on Saturday. Make sure you don't go on the rich people's nature trail on your bike, it's a touchy subject."
Boise,396f06,HiccupMaster,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:13:26 2015 UTC,"Have you ever walked the Riverside Village nature trail? It's really awesome, way better than the Parkcenter section. I used to be strongly opposed to the dismount zone, until I walked it. It changed my opinion. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't protest paving it and opening it to bicycles.  If you ask me, the bigger problem is the sorry condition of many sections of the Garden City greenbelt. Plantation Island is horrible. I wouldn't want to commute that on a road bike every day. And the section from Glenwood to the new footbridge is rough and too narrow. The wooded section is really cool but the trees on the edge of the pavement are going to destroy the pavement. I think Boise requires no trees within 6' of the greenbelt pavement to keep the root damage to a minimum."
Boise,396f06,HiccupMaster,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:38:20 2015 UTC,I haven't walked it but my kids and I rode through on Saturday reluctantly.  It does seem really nice and I understand the people who don't want people riding through but besides riding back through the neighborhood again I wasn't familiar with anyway to get back to Eagle road and the trail seemed much faster (one of my kids was super cranky).  Next time we'll park at Glennwood to ride towards Boise.
Boise,3974o9,pleen,4,Tue Jun 9 19:05:12 2015 UTC,"As always, be diligent in your research when people try to sell you business equipment. A looming deadline is a high pressure sales tactic, and is pretty easy to buy into.  If you are happy with your credit card service provider, contact them to see if your equipment is adequate or if you need a new unit. If you are unhappy with your current provider, there are a few local options at great rates."

Boise,390zka,Socific,3,Mon Jun 8 14:50:11 2015 UTC,"So I'm sure you all know that Boise has a lot of nerd shops, the FLGS. I think we have 4? Two All About, an ABU, and Wizard's Den. I might be missing something.  My question is, do you think that Boise has the base to support a bar themed around high fantasy? Something like old wood, thematic, tavern type place with lots of space to go there to play your tabletop and card games. There's some talk about it in a few other subs and it seems a really neat idea."
Boise,390zka,zetswei,6,Mon Jun 8 18:44:09 2015 UTC,"I think the issue most people have had with carrying out something like that, is that when you're in a setting for tabletops, what incentive is there for the company? You can't charge for time because then nobody wants to go, you can't force a cover because it's already going to be hard to get a good group of people, and you're not guaranteed they'll buy anything. You also have the fact that ""everyday"" people would have no reason to go in. Essentially you have a high risk of hours and hours of tabletops going on, with no concrete way to make money outside of hoping they'll buy some drinks. And if they're there for lets say 2 hours, and everyone buys 1 drink, you are losing out on space for potential customers who would buy more.  It's kind of a really high risk fairly low reward type place. Usually the convo goes back to spacebar, and how they're able to maintain board games and stuff because of money from arcade games, and the general atmosphere invites older people for a ""I remember this back in my day..."" settings."
Boise,390zka,Socific,2,Mon Jun 8 19:26:06 2015 UTC,"There's a place called Emerald Tavern in Austin, Texas that does pretty well, but they have a lot going for them. Exclusive local coffee, game rentals, the alcohol, lots of events, and it looks like they're licensed retailers of some of the game companies so it's a shop inside a bar inside a coffee shop.  Neat idea, but probably a financial and logistical nightmare."
Boise,390zka,zetswei,3,Mon Jun 8 19:37:33 2015 UTC,"That's just it though- They have other avenues. Most of the people who have brought it up here don't realize that 1) getting an alcohol licence iirc is a VERY long process unless you buy one from someone for a TON of money. 2) You have to have something other than beer. If you have finger foods you're gonna have messy tables on top of sticky tables from beer. 3) If you supply the games, people will complain that you don't have something, if you tell people to bring their games they'll complain that you don't have anything 4) Boise is a weird place when it comes to gaming. There are large groups of people who do it, but also lots of people who are too lazy to do it outside of their household. I say this coming form a competitive computer gamer, we have TONS of people who play in tournaments/get togethers from home, but as soon as we try to setup big events it's hard to pull people into leaving their house"
Boise,390zka,rragnaar,2,Mon Jun 8 19:45:40 2015 UTC,I love this idea and I don't even play board games much.  I'd put on my Dark Souls hoodie and come praise the sun while drinking a flagon of whatever is on tap.  I know two of my best friends would be all about this.
Boise,390zka,McBubbly,3,Wed Jun 10 16:49:55 2015 UTC,"My husband (43) and I (38) are planning to move to Boise from Chicago soon. I lived in Boise as a kid so I'm pretty familiar with the town and have always loved it and considered returning one day. I'm hoping my Chicago native husband will also love it because he's an avid mountain biker.  A few questions:  -we don't have any kids. Are we going to be considered total freaks there or are childfree couples/singles over the age of 30 relatively common? Should I worry about being able to make friends there? I have nothing against people with kids but I assume they're more interested in being friends with people who also have kids.  -we've been lucky enough to live pretty painlessly in Chicago with out a car for the past 10 years. I know the Boise area is more car-dependent but is there any hope that two people who like to bike and walk could live car-free there (at least temporarily)?  -finally, I'm a university admin currently and my husband works in a bike shop. What do you think the odds are of us finding similar employment in Boise?"
Boise,390zka,nakni2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"1) I know a couple in Boise in their late 40's/early 50's that are childless, and they never get flak. They aren't religious though, and I'd have to assume that that's where most of the pressure to procreate would come from. I don't know if it's common per se since Boise is a big family town, but maybe stick closer to downtown and away from tract-housing suburbia if you deem it an issue.  2)Boise public transportation is abysmal when it comes to coverage and frequency. It is a major major weakness of the area. Check out the map: http://www.valleyride.org/docs/ValleyRideBusSystemMap.pdf  You're pretty much screwed if you live in Meridian. I do know people who get by with only bikes most of the time, but their lives revolve around being near downtown and taking care of all of their needs in that general area.  3) I don't know anyone from BSU to have an opinion on how easy it would be to get a job there, but there are a decent amount of small and bigger bike shops scattered around downtown and the Greenbelt.  Chicago hot dogs: Taste of Chicago hot dog stand in Meridian (but limited hours and hard to reach without a car). Don't buy the sandwiches there.  Italian Beef: Jerry's 27th Street Market. Mostly Indian food but the owner is from Chicago.   The chain Chicago places (Old Chicago, Chicago Connection) won't feed the need IMO. There's an independent Chicago place even further out in Meridian called Bono's, but it may very well be the worst-reviewed restaurant in the valley."

Over expansion is a classic business mistake, it'll be interesting to see how this pans out 5 or 10 years from now.   FWIW. Here's the best answer when the same question came up at /r/tucson."
Boise,38tnta,Socific,3,Sat Jun 6 21:47:33 2015 UTC,"Excellent find on that /r/Tucson article.  The company is solvent, that is for sure.  The ""Sleep Country"" that my company was wiring up was bought up by mattress firm as we were building it (the one on cole west of the mall south of the freeway off ramp).  Gotta love change of direction at the end of the build.  Floor boxes added long after slab was poured, $1500 lighting control package swapped out for a $4000 that ended up being bypassed any way. I don't know about them, but we made our money.  Thanks   I also just bought a new mattress... from Denver mattress company right across the street =D"

The book store seen to the left was Arch Cunningham's at 910 W Main, which is now Alia's Coffeehouse-ish (a chunk was apparently lopped off for a parking lot).

Boise,38sz8a,proceedtoparty,2,Mon Jun 8 17:31:53 2015 UTC,If you've got all that up front it will be much easier. Apartment complexs usually have much less bend and leeway with their policies. Try to find a small house (much more enjoyable anyways having your own private space) as they can usually make their own rules and exceptions. Good luck!
Boise,38sz8a,oneofeverything,3,Mon Jun 8 17:37:44 2015 UTC,"I would suggest driving around and looking for signs in front of smaller complexes or groups of apartments, stay away from the big complexes.

Boise,38sz8a,youjerkfaceyou,2,Sun Jun 7 00:35:07 2015 UTC,"Stay away from parasitic Property Mgmt. companies.  They make a lot of money collectively through application fees, so there is an incentive to get you to apply then deny, send you on to the next place to do the same.  There are still a lot of private owners for duplexes, split older homes, or single family homes, that will rent based on the ability to pay, it just takes some amount of time to find them.    Also, right now, Boise has a vacancy rate that hovers around 2% which gives these companies the ability to ask for everything but your first born child, because there is a bunch of people applying for what housing is available.  This is the fault of the City Council's decision to stall affordable housing development in the city, and fast track huge market rate complexes, add to this the recent glut of families that lost their mortgages, and entered into the renters market a few years back, and the influx of new Idahoans, and it amounts to a housing crisis for a lot of low- and middle-income earners.  I know that wasn't what you were asking, but I work in housing, and get rather frustrated dealing with these places, and the systemic problems surrounding this issue."

Boise,38otlc,signedup2comment,2,Fri Jun 5 21:10:30 2015 UTC,"Boise in general sucks for traffic. The traffic engineers over at ACHD have their heads so far up their asses it's unbelievable.   We need more roundabouts. More. Roundabouts. Simple solution. I don't want another light put in anywhere.   They accommodate more cars in slower intersections per hour, are statistically safer, and don't fail in a power outage."
Boise,38otlc,Sterling_____Archer,3,Sat Jun 6 23:29:04 2015 UTC,"As someone that lived in Bend for 6 years, roundabouts are great most of the time. The entire west side of Bend (except downtown) has no lights, just roundabouts. Traffic is free flowing 90% of the time (mostly when schools get out and after 5 PM they back up a little). I'm not sold on the multilane ones yet though. Keep roundabouts for the medium traffic intersections (typically intersections between 2 lane roads, not 4 laners, though most of Bend's major roads other than the highways are 2 lanes), not high traffic ones.  One of the biggest problems with them is the construction of them sucks. You have to close all 4 approaches to the intersection, detouring around it. It can make for some nasty traffic and long detours. Look at this nasty detour map: http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/REGION4/US97MurphyRd/BrookswoodBlvdDetourMap.pdf  Following the marked detour would have added 5-10 minutes to every trip, each way, into town from where I lived. Detouring through the neighborhood streets (which they don't want you to do, but I'm sure everyone's doing it) would have been shorter but still a pain. And it lasts for months."

Boise,38hd6t,JJHall_ID,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:21:32 2015 UTC,I've never tried any of it but it looks like fun.  Please keep posting when you do the meet-ups!
Boise,38e9zr,gabangel,26,Wed Jun 3 17:22:02 2015 UTC,"Don't go to Internet Auto Sales, they are a bunch of crooks there. IMO"
Boise,38e9zr,TheOffTopicBuffalo,10,Wed Jun 3 17:38:56 2015 UTC,"I just refuse to do business with them because the sheer audacity required to name your absolutely-unrelated-to-the-web business Internet leaves a terrible taste in my mouth.   Good to know I'm not crazy, at least."
Boise,38e9zr,Xgamer4,2,Wed Jun 3 20:04:55 2015 UTC,I appreciate the feedback!
Boise,38e9zr,JhonKa,2,Wed Jun 3 18:39:32 2015 UTC,That's not the first time I've heard that.
Boise,38e9zr,NoOnesPrey,4,Wed Jun 3 19:03:05 2015 UTC,Probably won't be the last either.
Boise,38e9zr,Seventh7Sun,13,Wed Jun 3 19:28:12 2015 UTC,I have bought several cars from Fairly Reliable Bobs and they have always been good to work with and have been GREAT with servicing the vehicle afterwards.
Boise,38e9zr,just-plop,7,Wed Jun 3 18:04:14 2015 UTC,"I have purchased 2 vehicles from Bob's, and my extended family has purchased 2 of their own from them. We've all been very happy."
Boise,38e9zr,panda_foo,6,Wed Jun 3 19:02:05 2015 UTC,Another +1 for Bobs. My folks have bought two cars from them now. Once my scooby dies crosses fingers for never that is where I planned on going to take a look.
Boise,38e9zr,N8dork2020,5,Wed Jun 3 21:46:52 2015 UTC,Came here to say bob.

Boise,38e9zr,Infinitezen,3,Wed Jun 3 18:40:12 2015 UTC,Ditto on Fairly Reliable Bob's.
Boise,38e9zr,SqueezyCheez85,7,Sat Jun 6 17:30:45 2015 UTC,"For the best deal possible, you probably would want to look at craigslist, but it might not be doable depending on your finance situation.  But with a little patience you can score the kind of deal you would never get on a lot."
Boise,38e9zr,pleen,4,Wed Jun 3 18:16:01 2015 UTC,I've always bought privately. Hate dealerships.
Boise,38e9zr,ChesterJLampick,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:36:47 2015 UTC,"It's important when buying from anyone, but especially anyone on Craigslist, to see if the title is ""rebuilt"" or ""salvaged"". There are some shady folk out there pushing cars with bent frames and worse."
Boise,38e9zr,Brobocop,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:24:05 2015 UTC,I have a student (adult) that was a mechanic in his home country. He finds cars and fixes them up here in Boise now for a pretty slim margin. He works on my car too. I have sent him a lot of students of mine who are in a shitty situation with little money and he helps them out. Mostly Hondas and Toyotas but I think he has a Beemer at the moment. Backs up what he sells and will come to you to fix them if anything goes wrong. Super solid guy who knows what he is doing. PM me for more info
Boise,38e9zr,stories_in_flight,5,Thu Jun 4 04:07:43 2015 UTC,"Really depends on what you're looking for I suppose. Dealerships are almost always a huge pain in the ass.   But if you find something that looks like a good deal, tell them you'll take that car at their price, but that's your ""out the door"" price. No additional taxes, dealer doc fees, etc etc. Research online to see if it truly is a good deal.   NOT Kelly Blue Book. Use NADA price guides. Much more accurate."
Boise,38e9zr,janicuda,3,Wed Jun 3 19:15:18 2015 UTC,+1 to NADA
Boise,38e9zr,420cactus,4,Wed Jun 3 21:32:52 2015 UTC,"Do not go to to VW Audi either. They don't know what there cars have and don't have, will sell you the wrong thing, and tell you to deal with it."

Boise,38e9zr,janicuda,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:51:31 2015 UTC,To an extent. I would also think that they should know what their selling you also!
Boise,38e9zr,EdisMoochy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"It was bluetooth. They said the reason the button didnt work because it wasn't set up, but assured me 100 percent that it had it."
Boise,38e9zr,Dohhnut,6,Wed Jun 3 19:07:22 2015 UTC,"I work at Peterson Chevrolet and we have a good line up of used cars. A lot are overpriced in my opinion, but the salesmen are cool and will work with you. I recommend Joe Sandoval."
Boise,38e9zr,jurisnipper,3,Wed Jun 3 23:10:29 2015 UTC,"Pioneer Federal Credit Union gave me the best rate on my loan, and I bought my car at Boise Auto Clearance on Fairview. I liked them better than other places because they didn't try to ""sell"" me something."
Boise,38e9zr,gabesaporta,3,Wed Jun 3 19:10:05 2015 UTC,Ditto for Idaho Central Credit Union.
Boise,38e9zr,Sterling_____Archer,3,Wed Jun 3 20:03:40 2015 UTC,What kind of used car are you interested in? What's your budget?

Boise,38e9zr,dodadoBoxcarWilly,2,Wed Jun 3 18:41:23 2015 UTC,Be sure to check the VIN number with National Insurance Crime Bureau It's better than CarFax and free.
Boise,38e9zr,Meikami,2,Thu Jun 4 00:17:01 2015 UTC,"There is a large population of crooked used car sellers ""By owner"" on craigslist as well.....  If you buy on craigslist its worth your time and the $4 to get a title search and if you are willing to spend a little more a full carfax report."

Boise,384ues,rblaz007,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:45:48 2015 UTC,Step 1: get more city council members added. That way you'd have a more representative government more likely to invest in parts of town other than the foothills and the river near downtown.
Boise,384ues,jurisnipper,2,Tue Jun 2 02:14:37 2015 UTC,"Or, do what I did. Move to Garden City and enjoy the hell out of the tax base from the higher property values in City of Boise, along the river and near downtown."
Boise,384ues,pleen,2,Tue Jun 2 05:12:10 2015 UTC,"Eh, I live in Garden City. We don't even have side walks. That said, I love that Greenbelt two blocks away. I can be downtown on my bike in about 40 minutes. And I live way out on the west side.  edit. I thought you said higher tax base of Garden City."
Boise,384ues,dodadoBoxcarWilly,2,Mon Jun 8 11:55:29 2015 UTC,Where is this at? Looks awesome (sorry don't live in Boise anymore so not current with all the new constructions)

I'm from LA originally and most of our parks are filled with gang members and degenerates and drug addicts.  I know that area is near Garden City and have heard rumors it's not a great area?"

Boise,384ues,neednewhomestate,3,Tue Jun 2 02:40:37 2015 UTC,Ok thanks. I'm moving there in a few months.  Was just out in Boise a few days ago and I really liked what I saw. Friendly people and a chill city.
Boise,384ues,Brobocop,3,Tue Jun 2 02:58:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah when Garden City is considered the ""rough area"" of Boise, you're going to be juuuust fine coming from LA. GC can be rough but it's about a .5/10 compared to parts of LA."
Boise,384ues,neednewhomestate,3,Tue Jun 2 13:39:19 2015 UTC,"I tried to find a ""rough"" area when I was there last week....I could not.  All I found was lawns that weren't maintained very well and some run down cars."

Just because I do not want to live in an area that's infested with illegals, does not make me ""racist"" as you call it.  Please, seek mental and/or professional help. They can help you end your mental suffering."

Yes, there are mobile homes, and yes, people who can't afford much else live in some of them.  Turns out Boise has more.  Yes, we have meth-addicts, Boise has more.   Yes, we have visible signs of industry adjacent to residential areas, Boise has more.  Do stay away from this part of the valley if you are opposed to quiet neighborhoods, affordable single family houses adjacent to the river, and easy access to all of the benefits of living in the City of Boise which has a higher cost of living and stronger tax base."

I looked for places to live in Meridian....and while the areas were nice and green, lots of trees and grass and brand new construction.....it's not the kind of area a single guy in his 30's would want to move to. It just seems boring.  I like the river because....it's a huge ass river and I love water. It's also close to downtown. I also saw a ton of hot girls in the pools at the apartments I was looking at.  I can also see the local mountains from my balcony of my new apartment. I needed that. There isn't a view in the other apartments outside of the river...or at least none that I saw."

Boise,384ues,neednewhomestate,0,Tue Jun 2 05:19:50 2015 UTC,So should I stay away from that park?   How long before the park is finished construction?
Boise,384ues,pleen,4,Tue Jun 2 06:25:15 2015 UTC,Stay away from that park until construction is completed in about a year.  I can't think of any parks in this area which should be avoided. We don't have those kinds of issues here to speak of.
Boise,384ues,Bennyboy1337,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:32:34 2015 UTC,"They are cleaning all the junk up, it's low level waste, so probably petrol/oil byproducts ect. The park which should be finished around next spring will be kickass, make sure to check it out."

You can drink a beer and hang out in their loft. Tell them you herd the plug on radio boise and they may give you a discount.
Boise,384dv2,Hippie_Gumbo,3,Mon Jun 1 21:27:04 2015 UTC,"This. So much this. I get my beard done every few weeks at the beardsmith and I every time I come out looking like a damn rock star. Wendy and Ryan do amazing work and have cultivated such a welcoming, laid back vibe in her shop. They specialize in men's hair and beards, specifically the super sharp hair styles men wore around the turn of the 20th century. Very precise lines and fades makes any guy look great. Especially for a wedding. I can not recommend the beardsmith highly enough. I won't let anyone else touch my beard. Please let me know if you have any questions, I'd be more than happy to help you out."

I shave my head, so I haven't had the privilege of having my hair cut there but I've seen a lot of other guys get theirs done by her. She does precise old-school style hair cuts that make any guy look like a million bucks. Check out her instagram, she has a bunch of pictures on there."

Boise,384dv2,rragnaar,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:22:52 2015 UTC,The problem is that we are having the bachelor party only a few days before the wedding for travel... So I figured a couple days before would be good because if it turns out bad they can still go the next day. Good advice though
Boise,384dv2,pleen,2,Mon Jun 1 23:01:48 2015 UTC,"As others have stated, The Whiskey Bar is the only ""whiskey bar"" in town. It's more of a college bar but they have the best selection of whiskey in town. There are some other places such as Barbacoa and Chandler's that would have a good selection with a classier environment. Just depends what you're looking for. Piper Pub also has a decent selection (more scotch than american whiskey) but it is more of a generic restaurant/lounge."

Boise,38424y,Infinitezen,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:30:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the context!  Free speech ftw.
Boise,38424y,morosco,2,Mon Jun 1 20:45:05 2015 UTC,"That article is incorrect, the Court did not decide the issue on free speech grounds.  Roberts, writing for the majority, specifically wrote that it was ""unnecessary to consider any First Amendment issues.""  Instead, the Court held that what this guy did was not a crime under the language of the Pennsylvania statute.  (Or more specifically, the defendant wanted a jury instruction that required the jury to find, as an element of the crime, that he intended a to communicate a true threat, and the trial court denied that request.   The Supreme Court held that was error because the statute does require the state to prove that intent).   So this has zero implication for the Meridian case unless the Idaho statute is drafted similarly, AND if the state is, like Pennsylvania, unable to prove that the the defendant intended to communicate a threat.   Of course, if the Idaho statute does fit the conduct, the Meridian guy can certainly make his First Amendment argument.   You might think its crazy that a legal writer for a major TV station didn't read or couldn't understand the opinion, but its really not unusual at all."

Could I have been wrong in assuming that if I was looking for it....I could have successfully asked for, and gotten their phone numbers? I didn't try to pick up on any girls because I had more important priorities in my limited time there.  I realize you can't say for sure, but just wondering if anyone can explain the dating scene out there?  My thoughts are the guy(s) who are telling me this...have no game (not ""pickup game"" but they just can't normally talk to a girl without coming off as either a weirdo or a douchebag).   <<edit>> In case I'm coming off as a douchebag, I'm not.

I'll agree that Boise women are nicer in general (one theory is that L.A. women can be pickier with a wider berth of men to choose from). But 'tude or not, your chances of finding someone in their 30's or 40's who doesn't have kids are astronomically bigger in L.A. It's not just because there's more people, but there's a different mindset too. Boise is very family-oriented. It's a great place to raise one. I met many locals who married in their early 20's, both religious and non. Maybe if you hang around the late-night downtown bar scene, you have a better chance of meeting women who won't have kids to worry about (although, in my experience, many either had babysitters or had the ex watching them that weekend). Or go on Tinder and look for the women with no kids. But you're really limiting your options if you refuse to compromise."

Boise,382v17,neednewhomestate,-1,Fri Jun 5 14:16:40 2015 UTC,What's the cheapest (and most reliable) cable/tv and internet company in Boise?
Boise,382v17,Kou9992,4,Fri Jun 5 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"TL;DR They both suck, but CenturyLink can be cheaper and is more reliable in my experience, so I'd say go with them if you can get a fast enough plan for your needs.  CableOne starts residential plans at 50mbps for $50 a month and goes up to 100mbps for $100. No contract and you get a $15-25 discount for the first three months. Also offers home phone and cable TV.  CenturyLink starts at 1.5mbps for $44 a month and only goes up to 40mbps for $74 a month standard pricing, though not all speeds are available in all areas. They will discount any plan to $30 for your first 12 months (with 12 month contract) or to $35 for your first 24 months (with 24 month contract). Also offers home phone and provides bundling discounts if you bundle with TV from DirecTV or cell phone service from Verizon.  Neither technically have ""caps"" but they both have excessive use policies, which serve largely the same purpose. CenturyLink is 150GB for 1.5mbps and 250GB for all other residential plans, but in my experience they have never enforced the policy against me, even when regularly using 1TB+ per month, so I don't know how they choose to enforce it.  CableOne starts at 300GB for 50mbps and goes to 500GB for 100mbps. I have regularly seen this enforced, and if you exceed the monthly limit three times, they will force you to upgrade your plan or else they will cancel your service. If you're already on the 100mbps plan, your only option is to upgrade to a business plan which will be a huge increase in cost for the same speed.  Getting set up with Centurylink internet is much easier. Pay a small (~$40) activation fee plus your first month's cost of service, get your equipment in the mail in a few days, and get set up immediately. You can schedule an installation, but if you can follow instructions and plug in a couple cords then there is no reason to. In total, you'll pay around $80 and be set up in a couple days with no hassle.  CableOne will charge a large activation fee (I believe around $90) plus a $150 installation fee to get you set up. They offer ways to get both of those fees waived if you are willing to (like setting up autopay). Then you need to schedule a time for installation, which will usually be at least a week out, plus like any cable tech visit you get a very vague idea of when they will show up (my last install time was ""Sometime between 8am and 5pm""). A lot of the technicians are contractors from other companies and my experience has been that the contractors tend to do a bad job.   I've twice had installs done by technicians from a company called something like the Wire Guys or Wireless Guys, and both times they wired things in a way where it broke immediately after the technician left. If you call CableOne tech support afterwards (and before 2 or 3pm), they should be able to get an actual CableOne technician out the same day to fix it.  In total, you're looking at anywhere between $35 and $300, a weeks wait, and likely one very unpleasant day to get set up.  In my experience, CenturyLink is a lot more reliable. CableOne offers ""up to"" much higher speeds, but rarely delivers anything close to the max. My 20mbps from CenturyLink has always given me consistently 12mbps+, occasionally actually giving me 20mbps. My 50mbps from CableOne tends more towards 8mbps on average, regularly fluctuation to sub 4mbps, often dropping the connection completely, and I've never seen it actually exceed 28mbps.  Plus the modems/gateways CableOne uses are completely terrible (they mostly use Arris, which are all pretty bad, and Motorola Surfboards, which have improved a lot in recent models but still aren't very good). In April they set up a friend with an Arris DG860, which has huge known issues with wifi. It will regularly drop your wifi connection even if you are in the same room and going to a different room makes it practically unusable. Wired connections only fair a bit better. You will definitely want to buy your own gateway or modem+router if you go with them.  CenturyLink's modems/gateways aren't the best, but they work. If you are in an apartment or small house (single floor, 1-2 bedrooms), you shouldn't have any problems with using it from anywhere in your home. If you have bigger than that, you'll probably want to buy your own router.  My personal recommendation is to go with CenturyLink unless they don't offer at least the 20 mbps plan in your area. Plus if you're willing to make some calls and negotiate, you can usually manage to stay on the $30-35 a month pricing permanently for any plan, at the cost of probably having to renew your contract.  If they CenturyLink doesn't offer a good plan (some areas can't get better than 3mbps), then you should probably go with CableOne and just make sure to get your own equipment."

It was not a problem for me to purchase them--she just had to show up at the window and they visually verified she was of the right age, so I think you'll have no issues with transferability.  The high school ID should work fine.    I don't love the chair section--I prefer the lawn.  She will need to bring her own low-back chair for the lawn, but maybe you could buy her one of those to go with the gift, or another family member could do it.

Boise,37qe8q,Seventh7Sun,3,Fri May 29 16:20:51 2015 UTC,"Her high school student ID will work fine. The lawn is definitely the best. If you don't have a low-back chair, the rentals are only $2 (as of last season.) They accept card and cash both. Tickets can be purchased via phone or internet. Make sure you book the shows in advance. The last 1-2 weeks frequently sell out. The 5 ticket package will give her 1 ticket to each show, she can not see the same show twice. If you miss out on one of the shows and they are booked fully when you call, you're out of luck for that ticket and won't be allowed to reuse it on another show. She will show her student ID at the will call window prior to each show, and they will give her the ticket for only that show. From that point on the student ID is not checked. The tickets are not supposed to be transferrable, but as long as she was the one to pick it up from the window with her student ID, she could hand it off to someone who then used it without her and would get away with it. That being said, the Shakespeare fest is awesome and any non-students should pay full ticket price to support the show. Do bring drinks/snacks/picnic things, and bug spray.   Your present idea is awesome. I've been going to the plays out there since I was ten and I would have loved season tickets at her age. Good luck, and maybe try to see some of the shows with her!"

You can bring your own low chair for the lawn or they have rentals available for a couple bucks.  As mentioned before, bring a basket of food and beverage, or pick up something from the onsite cafe.

Idaho uses them based on an alphabetical list of all of the counties.  1A is Ada county, 2A is Adams County, etc.  The most common plates around here are:   1A - Ada County (Boise, Garden City) 2C - Canyon County (Nampa, Caldwell, Notus) 1P - Payette (Parma, Fruitland, New Plymouth) E - Elmore County (Mountain Home) 1G - Gem County (Emmet) 2O - Owyhee County (Homedale, Grandview, Bruneau) V - Valley County (Cascade, McCall)   Most personalized plates, and many of the ""premium"" plates have no designator, only the ""walk in and get the cheap ready-made plates"" tend to have the designator on them."

Boise,37gc8j,encephlavator,2,Thu May 28 00:00:04 2015 UTC,"This was my first chance at shooting lightning. Had a camera for years, but never been lucky when it came to lightning around Boise.   Worth noting, all these images are stacked compositions of 5 or so images."
Boise,37gc8j,amyzillamon,2,Wed May 27 12:43:10 2015 UTC,Nice. At one point I could see the lightning and Venus in that patch of blue sky.
Boise,37gc8j,amyzillamon,1 point,Wed May 27 13:05:24 2015 UTC,How cool! I also pulled out my camera but was at a loss for how to capture bolts. Could you talk a little more about what you did for these: camera settings & stacking process?
Boise,37gc8j,SagebrushID,3,Wed May 27 17:56:08 2015 UTC,"Sure thing.   Setup used was a Rokinon 14mm 2,8. Camera is a Canon SL1. Also was using a Slik Pro 330DX tripod.   I was shooting in the dark, with a full manual lens, so honestly, I am not sure what all my settings were, hah. There was a lot of trial and error. I was so fortunate that this storm was insanely long and I had like, a hour to experiment.   I was aiming for slightly underexposure at a 15~20 second shutter length. So the majority of the shots I had the ISO from 100~400. I was forcing light out by hovering around f8~15 or so.   One of the issues I was encountering was super over-exposure. Lots of these bolts were inside these clouds, so the clouds were blowing up with light, but no actual lightning and it was polluting my images. So that's why I was mostly aiming for darker, longer shots and I brought out a lot of the lightning in Lightroom with clarity adjustments.   One of the things you want to do with lightning is force low light settings so you can have your shutter open longer, for more chances of getting lightning. But to maintain that you need to create darkness by lowering your ISO and narrowing your aperture. I took over 100 photos and only got about 15 or so lightning bolts. Many many misses. It was just 15 or 20 second exposure one after another. Sometimes I would get great bolts in the frame, others were in between.   As far as stacking, that was pretty cake. I just loaded 5 or so of them into photoshop as separate layers and just blended each layer with ""Lighten"" as the blending option. Feel free to ask any other questions if I wasn't clear!"

I do generally only try to share the best highlights with reddit. About 130 pictures to 4, and those 4 are stacked compositions because I didn't feel like people would want to click past individual bolts."

I've only been a few times, but it was a lot of fun and I want to go more often. I also hear they do trivia on Sunday nights, but I haven't been to that yet.  You might also want to check out some of the events at the Egyptian. They do classic movies every month that are a lot of fun and have all sorts of other stuff quite often. This month they did Raiders of the Lost Arc, and they are doing The Last Crusade next month and The Big Lebowski in July.  Food-wise you can't really go wrong downtown. Some of my favorites are 10 Barrel, Pho Nouveau (if you like Pho, this is the best place in town), Fanci-Freeze or Boise Fry Co. for burgers, and Bombay Grill or Madhuban for Indian food (mmmm, curry chicken). For brews, 10 Barrel (again), and Boise Brewing are both great. 10 Barrel is loud, but the beer is great. Boise brewing is generally pretty quiet, but being a brewery it is pretty much beer only. If mixed drinks are more your thing, I might suggest The Reef. During the summer they open up a balcony outside that overlooks the street and it is great for a warm evening.  If you are into music at all, catch a show at the Neurolux. The record exchange is next door and both are super awesome.  Also, my girlfriend and I are both around your age (mid twenties) and love to play Settlers, etc. Let me know if you ever need/want anybody to play with or anything else feel free to PM me.

I have recently done a lot of backpacking / day hiking and camping. http://darkm0d.imgur.com/  If any of that peaks your interest, I can give details on the where. Generally, a lot of them are from the Sawtooth Mountains, which are incredible.   Bittercreek is great. The Mode Bar, across the street is great. I'm hard pressed to say they are slightly better then Red Feather. There are a few great breweries on Chinden Boulevard. Look into visiting Crooked Fence Brewing and Payette Brewing.   There are two events going on currently that are special to me. My favorite brewery, Anderson Valley (Booneville, CA) is visiting two local breweries here in town. One in Nampa (Prefunk) and Bier Thirty (Boise)."

Thanks again."
Boise,37hbjt,jonc20,2,Thu May 28 16:27:46 2015 UTC,"Well I'll be at Bier Thirty today since my favorite brewers are there! They have 2 exclusive beers on tap and man, they are great.   That aside, thanks for the compliments. Toxoway/Pettit is a fantastic 19 mile loop with I believe around 2700~3200 feet elevation gain. 3 hours is accurate. The drive is crazy easy. Like, 2 turns after you get out of the city. Get on 55 north, then turn at Banks Lowman and take that past stanley, right on 75, and drive a bit till you pull into where you're going.   That being said, there is a camp site right at the trail head of Toxoway loop, it is charged though. You can just hike in like, a mile or whatever and camp for free. Or you can camp anywhere outside of the campsite for free. That entire area has hundreds of trails. It's impossible to really narrow that down. I'd get yourself a Sawtooth Range Map For 8 bucks. water / tear proof. And it highlights virtually every trail there. Then it's just picking the one you want to do.   Another spot of note is Atlanta, ID. Now this is a very very small town. Don't expect much, it's not the least bit touristy. It is, however the ""gateway into the sawtooths"" I believe is their motto. Atlanta is on the south west corner of the Sawtooths, where Stanley is the North East corner. So they both get you to the same range, but just from very different sides.   Getting to Atlanta is treacherous at times, depending on weather. Like, we wanted to do a trip there this past fall but the road literally just fell into the river and they were cut off for months. But there are lots of hotsprings around there, camp sites, and great trails into more alpine lakes and such."

Basically, whenever people donate things that seem to be worth some money, (fancier jewelery for example) they sell it online.  This personally makes me sad, because I like the adventure of walking into a thrift store and seeing ALL that people have donated, but that's a sermon for another day.  Anyway, there is an etsy up where they sell some of those things. I would think that the prices are pretty reasonable, PLUS you're supporting Idaho Youth.   Check this out. I tried the ebay link, and the store is empty, and the amazon link just does books apparently. Click the etsy link and you might be able to find something nice.

Aside from that, CenturyLink's customer service is absolutely atrocious. They have signed me up for contracts I explicitly told them I did not want and then didn't even notify me that they made this change until 3:30pm on a Friday afternoon when their offices are closed all weekend, and trying to get anything done on the phone with them without making a huge ordeal out of it is impossible.  I never had issues with connection quality or outages or anything like that, though, so I guess that's a plus.  I switched to CableOne at the beginning of this month and now I get more than twice what CenturyLink was offering in my area, I get full advertised speeds (even a little bit faster, both up and downstream), and I haven't had a problem with connection quality (so far, anyway).

Boise,36gi1l,IAmRazgriz,1 point,Sun May 24 06:18:20 2015 UTC,"For me it was that I specifically made sure not to get a contract when I signed up with them a few months ago. I knew I was going to switch again within a year. Well lo-and-behold when I want to disconnect my service they say I'll have to pay ~$300 early cancelation fee. I was absolutely livid. I raised a big enough fuss that they ultimately dropped the fee though.   But another big grievance of mine is that I live downtown and could only get their 12mbs connection. I literally live across the street from a gigabit fiber line, leased by centurylink, but for whatever reason it's not possible to make use of it in any way."

Big surprise, actually only getting 4 down, they'd have to dig new lines if we wanted to upgrade.  It's painfully slow and we don't get what's being paid for all of the time."

The only cap not listed on CableOne's site is for the 100Mbps plan which is 500 GB/mo. Here's the rates for the other plans:   The 1.5Mbps, 5Mbps, 8Mbps, 10Mbps, 12Mbps, & 50Mbps services have a data guideline of 300GB per billing cycle, while the 60Mbps and 70Mbps services respectively have 400 and 500GB data guideline per billing cycle.

Then they got into their pissing contest with content providers (Comedy Central, et al) last year, now they want a digital box for each tv (5 in our household), so we re-evaluated or priorities and dropped the broadcast portion of our package intending to use over the air antenna, supplemented with streaming services. THEN last week, I got a pop up message on our browser,  2nd warning that we had exceeded ""data guidelines"" WTF? Never knew we had cap, excuse me, ""guideline"", and never saw the first warning. I know, caveat emptor, but seems to me that info should be clearly shown in their marketing material along with their pricing and Mbs speeds, instead of buried in the user agreement. We finally figured out that we exceeded it due to backing up my wife's photography archive (1TB+  she's a semi-professional). With everything going to cloud based storage how will this affect their business model?

The only reason it has more trees near the city is because they take care to help them grow.  Boise is pretty dry, but it's not what I would think of when I hear the word desert. It's not like northern Nevada or the salt flats in Utah for example.  Grass on lawns will not grow without dedicated sprinkler use. Vegetation on the sides of highways is usually a dull tan color. Every time I see the foothills I just think it's a bummer that they are brown instead of green. They would be such a pretty sight if they looked alive. (I do like the sight of the foothills, but they just seem like they had so much potential to be more.)  I do enjoy the weather here. It gets cold, but it's not full of snowstorms the scale that they had on the east coast this last winter. It gets hot, but it's not going to cook you alive like Florida.

However once you get up and out of that plain to the south/southeast, it is desert tedium with pockets of oases.  While both areas are at the same elevation, it's colder in the winter in Boise. The heat isn't as stifling in the summer, but being in a desert it's still going to get hot. I moved to Boise in July one year, and nearly every day that month was over 100.

I was never hurting financially, but accruing savings was problematic. Keep in mind that while the cost of living is low (especially when it comes to housing), it's not a blanket across-the-board cheapness as I found utilities and basic goods and services (things like groceries or car repair) to be either the same price or more expensive than when I was living in a big city.

Boise,36d84s,ClownWatch,2,Wed May 20 09:57:20 2015 UTC,Possibly a peculiar question but are there any organisations in/around Boise that are focused toward working on science/public health/nutrition policy (maybe even communications or health promotion)?

Boise,36d84s,janicuda,1 point,Mon May 25 06:44:02 2015 UTC,They will test you. They can tell because they have a device that the put up to the window. If you get pulled over they will test it and you will be cited. Its only an infraction.

There is also Idaho mountain touring and mcu sports downtown that you could walk to and rent a bike.  Edit:  we also have some of the best mountain biking and hiking trails in the country if you're into that stuff."
Boise,369yt4,Turbobaker4,2,Sun May 17 21:32:39 2015 UTC,"A mere couple hours north is some of the best white water rafting in the world. Guided runs leave out of Banks Idaho for anything on the spectrum, from dinky little class 1s for an afternoon float to the class 5s Olympians come the world over to train in. If you like outdoorsy stuff, this is a definite must do while you're here.    This speaks to another point though, in that you have to be willing to travel a bit to get to the really magical shit here in the State. Bruneu Sand Dunes are about an hour to the south, with a world class observatory in a protected national park. If you can scope out some good weather on a new moon, you'd probably need to be out on the open sea to see more stars.    North again is McCall. You can still play on the local water in Lucky Peak reservoir if camping's not your thing, but lakefront dining and cheap/free camping up there for the awesome whether around that time."
Boise,369yt4,Malbranch,5,Mon May 18 01:45:43 2015 UTC,"Public transportation in Boise sucks. Our bus system (such as it is) only runs once an hour during the middle of the day, stops running after 6pm, has limited Saturday service, and no Sunday service at all. Fortunately if you're downtown there's plenty of things within walking distance, more if you rent a bike from somewhere.   Without knowing more of what you're into, here's a random list of things in no particular order:   By June the river should be open for floating. You can bike over to Ann Morrison Park, catch the shuttle to Barber Park, rent a tube and float back down to Ann Morrison. The State Capitol building is open during the day. Has various art and history exhibits in the rotunda. Julia Davis park has the Boise Art Museum, Idaho History Museum, Idaho Black History Museum and Zoo Boise. If you like craft/micro breweries there are several downtown including Woodland Empire, Prefunk, Boise Brewing The Basque Block has some great bars, restaurants, museums and history. Catch a movie at the Egyptian Theater, a great restored 1930s cinema. If you're here on the weekend there are two different farmer's markets on Saturdays The first Thursday of every month many galleries and museums are free to visit On Wednesdays in the summer there is a free outdoor concert series called Alive After Five in the Grove, but there's a bunch of construction going on there right now so I don't know how that will affect that"

Everyone has been so kind on this thread."
Boise,369yt4,youveruinedtheactgob,2,Mon May 18 04:02:59 2015 UTC,"Brewery-wise, Boise Brewing, Postmodern, 10 Barrel, and Woodland Empire are the downtown options. Cloud 9, Haff and Payette are within easy biking distance. They are of variable quality, but I will let you form your own opinions. Bittercreek and Pre-funk downtown tend to have the widest/best curated taplists downtown if you want a one-stop beer destination."

If you're going to be in downtown Boise, though, everything's pretty close together and connected to the Greenbelt, and you can buy a bike for cheap and sell it to a pawn shop at the end of your visit. There are a ton of thrift stores around Boise where a working bike will cost $35- $65, but it's hard to find a bike that doesn't need work. The Boise Bike Project is downtown, and they sell refurbished bikes for $80- $150. The bike share program also just came back under the name Boise Green Bike, where you can (rent? borrow?) a bike."

Lots of cool shops downtown, Rediscovered Books if you're a reader, Sturman's if you are a cigar smoker, All About Games if you are a board gamer. If you want a sit-down style meal Fork or Bardenay are both great choices, Flying M for great coffee and atmosphere downtown. If you are a thin crust pizza lover Guido's (my favorite) or the Pie Hole will serve you well. The Capitol building can be toured and is nearby and has some awesome architecture. The walk to Hyde Park is short and they have some awesome local shops and food and it is only a little further to get to Camel's back park and hike the trail system.  If you want to swim there is Quinn's pond which is a bit of a walk but the greenbelt is close. The YMCA is downtown and as I used to work there I recommend it for workout. I will post more stuff as it comes to me."

Boise,36198b,pezasied,1 point,Fri May 15 20:09:19 2015 UTC,Would they empty them like that? There was a vehicle near each fire hydrant but the roadway was covered and in some places you had to take a detour. This was at 12am though so it would have been a good time to do it.

Other-wise their facility would become too small in a couple years.  The production capacity of 100,000+ barrels a year is based on the size of their brew house multiplied by how many times they can brew in a year.  I'm sure they will add new fermentation tanks and conditioning tanks as their sales grow.  It's not like the new place is going to be jam-packed with shiny new equipment right off the bat :)"

I know that's frustrating for some people who would like more notice, but I'm doing the best I can.  The good news is, it's always the same place, same day of the week, at the same time, so it should be super easy for you to catch the next one.

Boise,35m63r,franran,2,Mon May 11 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"We just rented a new house, we move in at the end of the month.  Whew!  We were able to find an owner landlord, and much prefer that to the property management companies here.  We've tried to go through them twice, and had less than great experiences both times.   1st time was when we moved here from out of state 7 years ago. We came to town for a long weekend so we could view some options, and get something set up for when we moved in the next month. We learned that no one wants to show a house on a weekend.  We must have made 20 phone calls, and never heard back from anyone until we were back home. We finally decided on a place based on pictures, and got everything taken care of through the property management company. When we showed up to move in with our 26 ft moving truck, the owner of the property was still in the process of moving her furniture out, it hadn't been cleaned, she then told us that she was going to have to leave some stuff in the garage for awhile. After going back and forth with mgmt company about how none of this was acceptable, we finally told them they were in breach of contract and we hopped on CL and found another place with an owner landlord within a hour.  Most recently, called about a property management house, the soonest they could schedule a viewing was 5 days later. We viewed the house, put in an application that night ($80 combined application fee for my husband and I), and heard nothing back from them. I call and leave a message after 4 days, no call back.  Finally we get an email saying they approved another application (2 days after we sent in ours) but we could still qualify for some of their other homes. I emailed her back to ask what happened? Why they didn't let us know sooner?  No response. Ever. Ha!  If you are coming from out of state it's hard. In our experience, most owners want to meet you in person. And a property management should be more convenient and help the process go smoothly. However I would advise, call often and ask many questions: dated pictures, so you know the actual current condition of the home, is it move in ready (no other furniture)...etc.     Another note, moving to Idaho we thought we'd be able to find a place with a little more space around it, maybe a little land. We were naive, I know that now. Meridian was the fastest developing area during the boom. It's basically a large expanse of subdivisions. And everyone knows the name of the subdivision they live in, which I just thought was silly. You can find older places with a little land, they exist, but few and far between. In any case, Good Luck!  tl;dr Property Management places we have dealt with leave much to be desired. Find an owner landlord if you can, craigslist was our best resource for that."
Boise,35m63r,clumsykat,1 point,Wed May 20 18:48:36 2015 UTC,"The property management places in town are pretty meh, just FYI.  From what I've seen they lack creativity and won't spend any mental energy (even if it doesn't cost more) to make properties nice.  If you can find an owner landlord situation I'd recommend it.  If you rent above $800ish from a property management place they are usually very accommodating about fixes etc., just don't expect then to go anywhere close to out of their way to provide proactive customer service."

Boise,35le7h,neednewhomestate,1 point,Wed May 13 23:48:12 2015 UTC,"I'm coming out to Boise in a month. I want to get an overall ""feel"" for life in the city and try to determine if it's some place I would like to move to.  Currently live in So Cal, cannot afford to live here any more. I don't have a job, but I do have around 1-1/2 years worth of living expenses (rent/car payment/etc) in the bank. The plan is to move to Boise (maybe) when my apartment lease is up in a few months, then find a job that pays around $15/hr to tide me over while I look for a normal job that pays me $40k-$50k. I do digital marketing and had a 7 year stint as a buyer. I'm sure I can find a job, it's probably going to take me at least 6 months to do so.  So far this is what I have planned:   Visit 2 apartment communities, ask for free tour of each. One in Boise, another one in Meridian. Get their contact info and leave mine. Visit Boise Chamber of Commerce. See if I can get any job leads. Chit chat with main person to get a feel for overall job market (if possible). Visit coffee shop or sandwich shop downtown. Eat/drink and try to strike up conversation with local (assuming they're friendly and not stand-offish like they are in New York or CA) Visit Downtown Boise. Get out and walk around. Drive by river. Spend 1 hour driving around perimeter of Boise/Meridian. Just to get a feel for overall layout of city. Visit bar at night near the hotel I'm staying at (of which I don't know where yet).   Can you guys/gals suggest anything I might be missing doing here? I'm driving up from So. Cal.  I'd like to get a feel for the people of Boise (average person), a feel for the daily pace of life, a feel for ""quality of life"" but not sure how to quantify that.  If left to my own devices, I'd walk around for an hour, say to myself ""hrmm, this seems nice"" then go back to my hotel room and get on the internet. That's not what I want to do, especially after driving 950 miles.  I'm not anti-social...definitely more introvert than extrovert.  So that's a challenge as well. I'm not shy....just normally not the center of attention at a party. It's work having to meet new people, but I can do it.  I'm in my mid 30's, if that matters?"
Boise,35le7h,woody94,2,Mon May 11 14:55:07 2015 UTC,"Think a little more about what you want.  A lot of the advice focus's on downtown Boise, which is mostly walkable/bikeable and pretty cool really.  But then it's more expensive, more liberal, etc.  The outskirts/meridian are going to be cheaper but more of a suburban life style.  So if you only have a little time here, I'd think which direction you want to go and try to focus on one.  As other's have said, there is a big focus on family, a lot of people are married with kids by your age, so that's probably what lowers the dating pool."

She was 1/2 Cherokee, and had more black hair than her daughter who was in her late 70s. The two lived together, and really seemed to enjoy one another's company, as well as the fact that they were so old, and such a novelty.   I was told, before meeting her, that she was really sharp, in real good shape, and mowed the yard with a non-powered push mower.   She was definitely sharp and healthy looking. I asked if she really mowed the lawn, and she said ""Yes, I have to do that chore. My daughter's getting on in years, and isn't able to do it anymore"".   She died before her next birthday, dang it. She was really cool.   Years later, I had a friend who was over 100. I was hitchhiking home from the airport one New Year's eve, and he picked me up, on his way to a party, wearing one of those pointy party hats. The only indication of his advanced age was the way his head had kinda sunk into his shoulders. His chin was halfway down his chest (my g-g-mother had no such drooping. She had ramrod posture).

Boise,35be4o,Nichijo,4,Mon May 11 17:12:55 2015 UTC,"A long time ago, I moved to Hawaii, and was appalled by all the stories of corruption in the news. I lived there 20 years, then returned to the Mainland, to Boise (roots). I was really interested to learn if corruption here is worse than Hawaii.   At first, I thought there was less, because I didn't hear about it constantly in the news.   Then I came to the conclusion that the less you hear of it, the more there is. The difference was that in Hawaii, the press took its job more seriously, and was not afraid to kick up some dirt.   One guy who is a ""white knight"" in Boise, is David Frazier, who publishes the BoiseGuardian blog. He's a voice in the wilderness when it comes to exposing skanky ""creative financing"" development deals. We need more people like him."
Boise,35be4o,aciinboise,3,Fri May 8 18:48:39 2015 UTC,"One guy who is a ""white knight"" in Boise, is David Frazier, who publishes the BoiseGuardian blog. He's a voice in the wilderness when it comes to exposing skanky ""creative financing"" development deals. We need more people like him.    Just skimming through there... if that's the best he can dig up for corruption, I'm gonna say we're doing pretty good (or, at least, people are very, very good at hiding corruption in Boise).   I mean, really, taking advantage of tax exemptions because you leased to an educational business is not corruption. There's a clear, public good, justification for having that exemption - to provide perks to lease to someone that might not be as able to pay higher costs, for the benefit of education.   Apparently CWI is doing a shady purchase of land for over double the appraisal value. That could be interesting, true, but if that's really the worst corruption we've got..."
Boise,35be4o,Xgamer4,1 point,Fri May 8 19:37:59 2015 UTC,"OK, what do you want? Bags of cash?   This is how corruption works... the deals are so complicated, that even in the light of day, people glaze over when they're trying to figure them out. It gets boring, and that works to the developers' advantage.   Dave's taken the city to court a few times, and shut down deals like this. They just reshuffle the deck and deal it again. If that doesn't work, the state constitution gets amended to allow for previously illegal ""it's technically a lease, but really, we're selling it"" deals."
Boise,35be4o,forvrin,2,Fri May 8 19:56:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't buy it. CWI's need for the land is different than the average buyer's need for the land, so the appraised value really isn't that informative. That being said, they probably should have requested an appraisal, but this is an inflated scandal."
Boise,35be4o,Nichijo,0,Fri May 8 22:01:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, bags of cash would be nice, but what I really want is explanations for how these things are corruption. If I can't read the article and understand why this is corruption, I'm not inclined to call it.   Like I said, how is taking advantage of a tax exemption corruption? As I said, there's a clear benefit to the public good for such an exemption - that's literally the opposite of corruption!  As for the land purchase deal, I get that the purchase price is way over the appraisal value - I really do. And I get that there's hints there's a ""well, if you just slide us some extra cash..."" style deal going on there. But at the same time, there's absolutely nothing to convince me that this isn't a case of a land speculator basing the sale price off the land's anticipated worth in 10+ years, as opposed to this year's appraisal value. It's a prime piece of real estate, literally right next to the Boise river, and it's not clear to me that that's an unreasonable sum if taking in account potential future value. This would also explain why no appraisals were done - they wouldn't change anything because the sale price was based off potential future value, and not current value."

It just seems that anything interesting would be on a more secure carrier -- scrambled, or some hard-to-find frequency.   I remember years ago, finding out the police frequency for their cars, and then trying to find a radio that had that frequency available. I searched many electronic catalogs. Evidently, the FCC designates some frequencies...   I don't know what the feds were up to. Sounds like a stakeout for a foreign bad guy.

Another sideshow is to note that on some days, contrails persist and spread out in the sky, but on others, they disappear quickly. Why? So you note that yes, when they don't disperse, it does affect the day's weather, and ""see???"".   Another is to speculate that well, maybe jet fuel composition has changed in recent years...

Boise,353sii,Seventh7Sun,15,Thu May 7 05:06:49 2015 UTC,"Both places have their good and bad points. I have lived in Boise quite a while now, but I lived in the SLC area for almost a year at one point.  I will say that depending on where in SLC you live, the LDS thing can be VERY overwhelming. I was asked if I was ""a member"" more times than I can recall, and when the answer was invariably no, it was common for the person who asked to stop speaking to me after that point. I know a lot of Mormons, but Utah Mormons are really different from most of the people of that faith around here. Not sure why, but they seemed very clannish to me, and unless you were a target of proselytization, they aren't very open to you (again in my experience).  That said, SLC is a GORGEOUS place and the Wasatch mountains are spectacular. The outdoor recreation opportunities are off the charts, especially when you consider that Southern Utah is just a few hours away.  Boise is Boise. I love it here but it is not for everyone. I'll tell you what though, if you are into rafting, biking, drinking beer, hiking, Saturday afternoon festivals and things like that, it is really tough to beat Boise."
Boise,353sii,ReverandDave,3,Wed May 6 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"I lived in St. George for a few years back when I was younger, so i'm hoping that SLC wouldn't be as overwhelming as it is down here.  I've heard that Utah Mormons are the strangest, so I hope that if I do end up in Boise, that will prove to be true.  I really have to check out that city!  Thanks for taking the time to answer!"

Not cultish, clannish."
Boise,353sii,Tangsta1,5,Thu May 7 17:57:08 2015 UTC,"No idea about anything to do with SLC except mormons and mountains. I am fairly sure Boise has very slightly less of both.   But I can tell you that living here is nice. Somebody else posted a bit ago about wanting to know the #1 best thing to do A) indoors and B) outdoors in Boise..and I realized I had to struggle to think of indoor suggestions, while outdoor suggestions don't cease.   Since moving here 5 years ago what I do outside of the house involves walking or biking outdoors. This isn't just hiking/biking in the foothills; I just mean that most of my free time spent not in my house is spent lollygagging around the park playing games, or leisurely riding my bike up and down the greenbelt, wandering around exploring places, visiting the Saturday market, or shopping or walking around downtown. It's a very nice place 3/4, maybe even 4/5 of the year to just spend time interacting outside. You can grab a drink and a bite on a patio most months out of the year. So if that sounds appealing, then give it a go.  Indoors it's about the same, I'd expect; though from what I understand we do have WAY better beer/drinks here, and I would have to bet our food is better too. There's plenty of fun things to do and good local places to fuel hobbies. Pick a hobby, and I bet there's a great outlet for it here.  What you do for work will have a large effect on how you like a place. You can find niche unique jobs here, and you can find typical corporate or chain jobs here too. Hiring is pretty steady right now. Depends on what you can do and what you like. I work primarily in the building and creative industries and have seen a lot of those jobs come back in the past few years. My husband works in tech and that's still going strong.  The culture here is pretty relaxed as far as attitudes go and active as far as lifestyles go. Friendly and upbeat all around. I've made the nicest friends I've ever known here.  I dunno. It's a nice place to be. That's about the best I can say about it."
Boise,353sii,Guira_guira,3,Wed May 6 22:36:01 2015 UTC,"Just listening to you describe exploring outside made me excited. As far as work goes, I'll probably start by getting anything I can get.  Right now I work for an ad agency as an editor (writing a book on the side), but I've worked hostess/serving jobs to pay rent and been OK. So I'm sure I can make ends meet one way or another.  Thanks for your answer! I appreciate it."
Boise,353sii,SagebrushID,3,Thu May 7 00:19:27 2015 UTC,Moved to Boise a year ago and it is fucking great! Tons of things to do and places to visit. If you loved skiing I think that would be the one reason to go to SLC since there is more near it. Seriously Boise is amazing and that is in a large part due to the great people. I just don't think that you will get the same personal experience or long term friendships at SLC as you would in Boise. I mean not saying the people are bad there but when you are dealing with ~50% lds your odds are less likely to have the life long relationships
Boise,353sii,MattyB6343,1 point,Wed May 6 23:32:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. I can read the enthusiasm in this paragraph and I love it.  I moved around (new city every year almost) since I was 10, so I need to do some catching up and make some long term friends (the dream!).  I'll definitely look into it.  Thanks so much for taking the time to answer!"
Boise,353sii,brockobear,4,Thu May 7 02:30:16 2015 UTC,"I lived in SLC for about 6 months (and have visited many times after that) and I've been in Boise a little over a year now. So I don't have a lot of longevity in either spot, but here goes.  SLC: Gorgeous! SLC is so pretty and has a lot of opportunities to enjoy that beauty by driving out to the local canyons, forests, Antelope Island on the Salt Lake, etc. SLC also has way better public transportation and more/better bike lanes, so if you don't have a car or want to take advantage of public transportation, SLC has Boise beat in that department. SLC, in my opinion, is also more walkable than Boise. For the cons, SLC has ridiculous liquor laws, and (as previously mentioned) the beer is typically less exciting. Epic Brewing is doing some awesome stuff, but they're the only brewery that is really pushing the envelope there (in my opinion). SLC is also less safe than Boise. Most of the crime is non-violent and opportunistic, but I had my bike stolen and know three people who had their cars rifled through, one person who had their car window broken, and two people who had their car stolen. This is out of the like 20-30 people that I knew there. It's definitely worse in some areas than others, but doesn't appear to be completely absent anywhere.   Boise: Also very pretty, with opportunities for day trips to scenic areas, camping, etc. Housing is more affordable. Boise is smaller, so it's quieter and has more of a small-city vibe. There's a lot of great food here, and a lot of people are really into eating local. Lots of good beer too! Boise is also a lot safer than SLC in terms of crime. One of Boise's biggest downfalls is the job-market for young adults right out of college is iffy. I've known a lot of people who have struggled to get decent jobs here, mainly because it seems that it more caters to mid-career folks who are moving here to start families. It's not true of all professions, but it is common. I got really lucky when I moved here at 22 and landed a solid job, but like I said I was absolutely lucky. Also, it's expensive to fly anywhere from Boise because it's secluded and not a top-destination for many people. Plus the airport isn't International. And public transportation basically doesn't exist here. You can bike to a lot of places (especially downtown), but sometimes you run into roads with little to no bike lane.  Ok...that's what I've got for now. I love both cities - I have a huge soft spot for both of them and don't think you could go wrong either way. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or if you end up in Boise! Good luck!"
Boise,353sii,MattyB6343,3,Thu May 7 14:52:03 2015 UTC,"I lived in SLC years ago and couldn't get out fast enough.  The pay was so dismal that I had to borrow money from family to get out.  Lived in several other cities (including Portland, Denver, Boulder and others) and picked up a husband along the way.  We landed in Boise and have been here ten years and plan to stay.    There are far fewer Mormons here and you don't get the constant judgy-judgy here like you do in Utah.  One down side is that pay here isn't much better in a lot of places."
Boise,353sii,doteman,5,Thu May 7 04:14:04 2015 UTC,"If you live in Boise and tell people you're not Mormon, they'll shrug their shoulders and move on. Do the same in somewhere like Provo and you will be socially exiled, as in you have no friends, as in everyone will avoid you, as in kids will be told to walk on a particular side of the street because so-and-so isn't Mormon. I don't know about other portions of SLC (I assume it's a little better), but I have never seen that level of xenophobia anywhere else but Provo.  Source - I am the only atheist in a whole family of Mormons, half living in SLC, the other half in Boise.  One side has accepted it and moved on, the other side is trying to convert me back."

I like the mountains.  I like the outdoors. It's pretty, and I was born here...But maybe I'll fit in a bit better in Boise (although the Mo population seems to be quite similar to SLC)...

Boise,353sii,PabstBlueKitten,1 point,Fri May 8 14:26:30 2015 UTC,"In-N-Out is popular enough to be a nationwide chain, but they have strict standards that keep their growth slow (but steady). They are 100% family owned, meaning that franchising is out of the question for expansion. Also, they don't freeze their beef which means every restaurant must be within a few hours of the company-owned distribution center it is coming from.   So that's the reason why they're only in CA, Reno, AZ, Vegas, SLC, and they just recently entered into the Dallas area. But you've gotta figure they'll expand into the northwest at some point. Southern Idaho would be the perfect place to put a distribution center to reach as far west as Seattle and as far east as Denver. We've got cheap land, cows, and potatoes..."

Boise,353sii,Daenr,2,Thu May 7 03:18:38 2015 UTC,"So I've been here for 10 years and I've traveled to several different cities all over the country. Boise is by far one of the most livable cities in the US and one of the most unique.  The city is beautiful, you get all four seasons, dozens of outdoor activities are almost immediately accessible, there's never too much traffic (unless you commute to Meridan or Nampa) the crime rate is low, the cost of living is low, the ever-growing downtown area are a great place to spend your days, lots of trees and city parks populate the city, the Boise River greenbelt is a beautiful place to run and bike, the city is a haven for independent, local commerce, most of the people are incredibly nice.   I could go on and on, but you get the point: I love my city. Boise is unlike any other place to live."
Boise,353sii,Socific,1 point,Thu May 7 04:02:48 2015 UTC,Even the commute to Meridian isn't that bad depending on what you're comparing it to. It only takes me 25 minutes to get from East Boise to West Meridian (without construction traffic).
Boise,353sii,BeeSesh,2,Thu May 7 09:30:54 2015 UTC,"I've lived in the Western side of the Treasure Valley my entire life.  I've traveled to Salt Lake several times and I've liked it down there every time.  I do know that if you don't live in Boise, anything other than outdoor recreation is pretty non-existent.  You'll need to travel to Boise (usually a 30-45 minute drive from most places) to have any kind of a night life.  Nampa is building and actually becoming a shopping destination so that is helping.  Depending on your political leanings, the Boise area can be a good fit.  It is the most ""progressive"" area in the state by far.  That said there are a ton of people here that are staunchly ""conservative"" to the point I'd call them ""regressive"" or even ""backwards"" in many cases, and while I tend to lean away from the conservative side on many issues, I'm nowhere near what I would consider ""liberal.""  Our lawmakers really have no idea what they're doing, just do some quick searching on our governor, Butch Otter.    With all of that said, I have some friends move to the Ogden area (just North of Salt Lake City) a couple of years back and they absolutely love it down there.  They said it is actually a bit more progressive than Boise was, and they said they've rarely run into any issues with not being Mormon.  I think either place may be a good fit, and any place will be partially dependent upon what particular section you live in, the friends you hang out with, where you work, and what activities you enjoy."

Boise,3506j4,iSmirinoff,6,Wed May 6 02:32:46 2015 UTC,"But that is kind of a low blow by deadmau5. Lol   It depends on your perspective really. Kim and Paris landing a residency at Amnesia is a huge insult to artists like Deadmau5. Amnesia and Ibiza in general has a legacy when it comes to clubbing and raving history. When you have people like Paris and Kim who didn't have to work to gain a residency at a huge club like Amnesia it shows a really good example of how the club/rave scene has gone mainstream. If you've noticed within the past decade the rise of pop EDM and how huge it's grown it starts to give you an idea of where Deadmau5 is coming from. Imagine working your entire life to be really good at something. You put forth all the hours and effort to become famous and make a name for yourself. Then somebody comes along and gets the same fame without putting in any effort with respect to your craft.   Sure playing prerecorded sets and pretending to mix is one thing. but it really only scratches the surface of what really lies beneath. When I hear of jaded ravers talking about how the scene today isn't anything like it used to be, I take it with a grain of salt. But you can't ignore what they're saying without at least acknowledging that they are on to something in one way or another. Kim and Paris are just the latest example."
Boise,3506j4,DjGranoLa,3,Wed May 6 02:52:12 2015 UTC,I meant the inustl was towards Boise being called generic and dry like Kim and Paris.

Boise,34xz1f,boisecynic,5,Tue May 5 14:18:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's any surprise, everyone knew there was likely to be petroleum products in there. There used to be an airstrip there. Hopefully the bad dirt is minimal. Remember the same thing happened with Bodo and delayed it by 9 months, iirc.   Quick google for Bodo remediation finds:  http://www.mti-id.com/projects/bodo-marketplace-environmental-phase-i-ii-iii-remediation  Aha:    Bodo Development Back on Track Friday, April 23, 2004.  Most of the work should be done by late next year   Joe Estrella   Staff   The $60 million BoDo downtown redevelopment project will be virtually completed by late 2005, almost a year behind earlier estimates, BoDo developer Mark Rivers said Thursday.   Rivers, whose company, BoDo Partners, is renovating the historic downtown warehouse district formerly known as 8th Street Marketplace, offered that assessment while giving Boise Mayor Dave Bieter his first tour of activity on the project.   Unlike the stalled Boise Tower, University Place and Boise Centre at Capital Station projects, BoDo is the lone major downtown redevelopment project still on its feet.   Work is running behind schedule, Rivers admitted, because of a nine-month, $1 million environmental cleanup chore required by 16 leaking underground petroleum storage tanks that had contaminated soil and groundwater on the northeast end of the project.   Nevertheless, 200,000 square feet of retail and 100,000 square feet of office space, along with an 11-screen multiplex theater and a four-story parking garage, will be completed by late next year, leaving only a seven-story Hampton Inn & Suites hotel to be built atop the parking garage on the southeast corner of the project, at Myrtle and Capital.   ""People tease us that we have downtown´s second open pit,"" Rivers said, referring to the Boise Tower site at 8th and Main. ""But we´re here to show that we´re starting to see tangible progress.""   Bieter said he was pleased with work being done to open up Broad Street to allow traffic to flow east from 8th Street to Capital, while improving foot traffic on the east side of the project by widening the sidewalk on Capital.   ""It´s a great fit with the concept we´re working on: a walkable, connected downtown,"" the mayor said.   The tour included a stop at Miss Molly, a women´s boutique and gift shop preparing for its grand opening last night in the 8th Street Marketplace Building.   ""I always wanted to own my own business,"" said Molly Roche, who moved to Boise six months ago after being laid off from a high-tech job in Seattle. ""The economy in Boise is good, and the whole BoDo vision is attractive to me.""   Miss Molly is one of 15 new retail and office tenants to open in BoDo in the last 18 months, Rivers said. Another 15 are expected by the time the project is completed. That will include as many as five major nationwide chains that will join P.F. Chang´s China Bistro, a national Asian restaurant chain that was among the first to commit to BoDo .   Rivers said the Hampton Inn Suites component of the project was not hurt when Boise voters rejected plans for a new downtown convention center earlier this year.  ""You´ve still got a major corporation saying that Boise is still a good place to build a hotel, even without the convention center,"" he said.   BoDo progress report   Work has begun on opening Broad Street between 8th Street and Capital to allow easier access to BoDo .   The sidewalk on the west side of Capital will be widened to allow better foot traffic.   Fifteen new tenants -- retail and office -- have opened at the BoDo project.   Construction on an 11-screen multiplex and the four-story BoDo garage is expected to be completed by late 2005.   A seven-story Hampton Inn Suites atop the garage is scheduled for completion in 2006."

Its just a tap room, but you can bring takeout in or order it there.   If you are willing to drive a bit, there are three breweries on Chinden in Garden City: Payette Brewing, Crooked Fence, and Haff Brewing. All are a bit different, and I think they all have tap rooms. I know Payette and Crooked Fence do, but I've never been to Haff (they opened not too long ago).   Otherwise we have a few great beer and food places with lots of taps downtown. Bittercreek has good food and lots of taps including local and some more funky styles. Taphouse has lots of taps and is kinda a sports bar/pub. Prefunk is just drinks, no food, but lots of beers on tap and you can get a 32 oz can of anything on tap.   Hope that helps! Enjoy the weather and drink some beer!"

Boise,34uhlg,Gradual__russian,3,Mon May 4 20:45:53 2015 UTC,"We were lucky enough to have the place to ourselves, which was really really nice. Given the isolation of the pools and the ""anything goes"" attitude I can totally see how things would get out of hand enough for the BLM to crack down."

Boise,34uhlg,offensiveusernamemom,3,Tue May 5 00:13:41 2015 UTC,I don't expect the people that misused the place to respect the signs that say it's closed. If anything I bet it will be worse off because the non-assholes that would clean up after they soaked will observe the closure. I doubt it will be sufficiently policed at 2am on Saturday mornings.  Edit: I guess they're going to demolish the pools; I imagine that will deter the party crowd.

While I've never seen these activities happen first hand at Skinny Dipper it sounds like those were the things cited in the BLM's decision.

Boise,34uhlg,andylion,3,Tue May 5 20:18:36 2015 UTC,"I loved going there but honestly I'm glad it's closed for now to recoup. I think 5 years might be a bit excessive, but we'll see."

From the BLM, thanks Jason Stern for asking if there's hope or if we would be wasting energy trying for an appeal:   ""Thanks for the note to BLM about your interest or perhaps even willingness to help keep Skinny Dipper open to the public. The short answer to your question is yes, we are interested in talking with any group that would be willing to maintain the site. That was our hope all along, but no individual or group stepped up and offered the help we sought. Your offer is one of several we received in the last couple of days that provide us with some hope that we can work out a resolution.  I will point you toward the field manager for the area. His name is Tate Fischer and his number is 384-3430.  Thanks very much for your constructive interest.  Don Smurthwaite  BLM Communications"""
Boise,34uhlg,Bennyboy1337,2,Wed May 6 16:47:54 2015 UTC,"This is so disappointing.  I've been wanting to go up there for years and just never got around to it.  I should learn to stop procrastinating so much.  It is too bad they can't put some resources into policing the area enough to deter the bad behavior rather than shutting it down.  If they put a couple of pit toilets in a short walk away it would probably deter the issues with human manure being left around to stink and contaminate the water.  Beyond that if they had officers randomly show up a couple of times per day/night, at random times, they could probably put a stop to the more illicit drug use and underage parties if that is the problem.  There is a facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/saveskinnydipperhotsprings) where the owner claims to have been there ""every other day"" for the past year and has not seen any of the trash or needles the BLM is using as the excuse.  I realize this is biased in the other direction, but it does make a person wonder what the real reason behind closure is.  It sounds to me like they just don't want to bother sending a law enforcement officer out there on a semi-regular basis to enforce the law, and figure it is easier to destroy the pools and shut it down.  If it became known that law enforcement regularly drops in unannounced I think the offending behaviors would go away rather quickly."
Boise,34uhlg,JJHall_ID,5,Tue May 5 15:38:27 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear that you missed out...it really was a beautiful spot. However, there are a few things worth noting in your response (and in the response of others). Specifically, the site in question was public land...and the pools themselves were constructed without permission.   And with good reason. Its an absolute hike to get up there and there's little in the way of flat ground for the construction of pit toilets. What's more, given the number of springs in the immediate area there's likely quite a bit of ground water that could easily be tainted by an improperly installed pit toilet system.   Ultimately Skinny Dipper could never exist in any kind of official capacity. The location isn't really suited for major development or foot traffic, and the liabilities associated with the space (ie ensuring the health and safety of people using the hot springs) are too great.  The fact that Skinny Dipper was allowed to exist for as long as it did  is pretty amazing, and frankly shows a great deal of patience on the part of the BLM. They could have very easily destroyed the pools and fined the builders as soon as they were built back in 90s. Instead Skinny Dipper was allowed to exist in a kind of gray area until things hit critical mass. I  Its like the really awesome kegger that one too many people shows up to and is subsequently shut down."
Boise,34uhlg,andylion,1 point,Tue May 5 20:35:16 2015 UTC,"I think that is a very fair assessment. Having not been there myself it is hard to form a true informed opinion.  What seems obvious to me now may be impossible for reasons that would be obvious after visiting the area.  It's just unfortunate that some kind of compromise couldn't be reached.  I read somewhere that they tried to make it a use permit area, but that it was ignored.  How many people were ticketed for accessing the area without a use permit?  It just seems like the BLM said ""No, don't do this!"" but never actually did anything to enforce it.  Now they claim ""We made the rules but nobody followed them.""  Of course they wouldn't if there were no consequences for the violations.  The idiots who ruined it are the kind that don't care if they ruin it for everyone else.  They have to be immediately and individually inconvenienced for them to change their behavior.  ""We'll close it down for everyone!"" means nothing to them, they'll just go find another place to party and destroy."
Boise,34uhlg,JJHall_ID,2,Tue May 5 20:54:29 2015 UTC,"Well said...and unfortunately there isn't really much that can be done about people like you are describing except to hold those people responsible on a social, civil, and criminal level whenever and and where-ever they may be found. This includes our friends, loved ones, and ourselves.   As for the BLM, I feel like their biggest failing was doing such a poor job publicizing their permitting efforts and being more forthcoming about their mounting frustration with the site. Based on the information presented it sounds like they've been moving towards this decision for a while now. While I don't know if the outcome would have changed, I suspect the outrage would be significantly less if more people were made aware of these issues sooner."
Boise,34uhlg,andylion,3,Tue May 5 21:08:39 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like they just don't want to bother sending a law enforcement officer out there on a semi-regular basis to enforce the law,   Yes, that seems reasonable. Until you consider that now, they're going to have to send officers down there to kick people out.   Sounds like spite."
Boise,34uhlg,Nichijo,1 point,Tue May 5 17:14:09 2015 UTC,If they follow through with destroying the pools I don't think they'll have too much trouble with people up there after word spreads.  If they were leaving the pools intact I'd agree with you wholeheartedly.

Boise,34uhlg,dizzyizzie,0,Tue May 5 23:10:16 2015 UTC,"This is so wrongheaded. The duty of the government should be to follow the desires of the people and accomodate them -- to ""secure their rights"" (ref: Declaration of Independence).   If lots of people are using the place, the role of government should be to keep it safe for The People. Not to shut it down for everybody, because some people don't respect the rights of others to have a clean, safe place to enjoy -- on the land they (the public) own."
Boise,34uhlg,Nichijo,3,Tue May 5 17:18:31 2015 UTC,"Technically the federal government owns the land, and while the federal government belongs to ""We the People"", you'd be pretty hard pressed making that argument if you were to attempt to take a book from the Library of Congress, or bring home a zebra from the National Zoo. Both are federal institutions, and both ""belong"" to the people of the United States. However each organization's property claims (be it books, animals, or land) supersedes that of any individual American.   This is because the items in question belong to all Americans, and as a result organizations like the BLM have to balance the recreational enjoyment of one handful of citizens vs. the health, wellbeing, and livelihood of another group of citizens (say for example folks who would like to have a shit-free Payette). Is it unfair that the BLM is closing down Skinny Dipper because of the poor behavior of a few? Absolutely! But is the BLM justified in their decision based on their responsibility to act as stewards of federal land for all Americans? You bet!"
Boise,34uhlg,andylion,1 point,Tue May 5 21:27:09 2015 UTC,"I've seen federal land listed on real property tax directories as owned by ""The United States of America"". It is governed by various agencies.   But my point was, that if a place on federal or state land is a ""natural magnet"" (or ""attractive nuisance"" as it's sometimes called in lawsuits), then it deserves, the people deserve, to have the place protected so that the people can get better use out of it, rather than protected from the people; protected for the people.   tldr, put in some outhouses, fix it up, patrol it, rather than bulldoze it.

Boise,34tluz,fuckyou_space,3,Tue May 12 17:22:08 2015 UTC,There are indeed a couple brand-new locations that are directly across the street from each other. I can only fathom reasons why this would be that require a tinfoil hat.
Boise,34tluz,3rdNipp1e,1 point,Tue May 5 21:37:56 2015 UTC,Mattress Firm recently bought out a major competitor (can't recall the name) in the area. They converted all their stores into Mattress Firms. That's why you will sometimes see two separate Mattress Firms located literally across the street from each other. Not quite sure how this makes sense as business model though.
Boise,34tluz,WheresJadeAt,1 point,Tue May 12 09:14:31 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking about moving to Boise. (Other options would be Boulder/Denver, CO, Asheville, NC, and maybe Carpinteria, CA). I have a few questions.   1) I'm originally from Utah (A never-Mormon). I went to college in California (Nor-Cal). Now I can live anywhere, and though I do love Utah/midwest and feel like i'm at home when I see the mountains, I would like to live somewhere a little... less Mormon-concentrated. I take it Boise is a safe bet at least in comparison to Utah, but I wanted to get your thoughts on that...?  Honestly - I've lived in such a concentrated area of Mormons that I am used to feeling a little like an ""outsider"" and I don't mind. However, now it's a little tough because most people my age are already married and having their second child. I'm just kind of on a different page.  2) I am a 22 y/o single female. I love a good music scene/food scene, would love to become a regular at a coffee shop, and don't drink or smoke so club/bar scene isn't a big thing for me. If I'm considering looking into Boise, what neighborhoods should I look into? What am I looking at rent-wise for a fitting neighborhood? (My budget is small - think of a small budget and than imagine that budget to be ten times smaller and then you have a good idea. * I would be willing to work more/pay more for ""the perfect place.""  3) I'm going to be venturing out on my own. I have no friends/family/connections. I've never liked big cities, but in your opinion, is Boise going to be able to fit a stranger who has no place to call home yet like myself?  I'm planning on making a trip over there in July to check it out myself, so I'm just doing what I can on the internet until then. Thanks for your time guys!"
Boise,34tluz,biochromatic,3,Tue May 5 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like Boise is a great fit for the things you've described.  1) I'm a Mormon who grew up on the East Coast, but went to school in Utah. I was absolutely overwhelmed by all the Mormons there (even though I am one). I moved to Boise because I wanted to get to a less Mormon-concentrated area like you mentioned. Obviously there are Mormons here, but it's not like Utah. Most of my neighbors are not Mormon.  2) You'll definitely find the music/food/coffee shops that you're looking for in downtown Boise. I pass by a coffee shop everyday that has people lounging in soft chairs and stuff. My co-workers and I go to a few different coffee and tea shops every now and then and just take a break from work, or there's Guru Donuts which is great. I used to live in Laurel Park Apts which is like a 5-10 minute bike ride from downtown. The rent there was between $600-$800, but if you have roommates that's not bad.  3) I moved to Boise without knowing anyone here and it was great. I made friends at work (and church) that I hang out with. Honestly this city is like the perfect size: it's not too big like Salt Lake (which isn't even that big of a city), but it's definitely not too small either."
Boise,34tluz,WheresJadeAt,3,Tue May 5 22:06:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  This makes me even more excited to check it out.  That's funny that you were overwhelmed by all of the Mormons even though you are one.  It never bothered me too much, but I lived out of state for more years than I have in Utah.  Still as much as like Utah, I think it's time to get some space.   I'll be sure to check out Laurel Park Apts.  Sounds like the perfect location.  I'll definitely be living with other people, it's just something I've come to accept.  And actually, it will probably work out better that way since I don't know anyone.   Again, thanks for the answer. Can't wait to see what it's like with my own two eyes :)"

Boise,34tluz,encephlavator,1 point,Thu May 7 22:06:19 2015 UTC,You should delete and then repost this in the new question & answer thread for May 11. The reason is that the Q&A refreshes every Monday morning. The previous week's Q&A doesn't disappear but it drops down the main page quite a bit.   My quick thoughts: 1 hour driving around is probably not enough to get a feel for the city. Boise/Meridian/Eagle is bigger than you think. Greater Boise is nearly the size of metro San Diego with 1/4th the people but 1/20th the freeways. Finding a quick $15/hr job to tide you over will probably take longer than you think.
Boise,34tluz,neednewhomestate,1 point,Mon May 11 01:42:55 2015 UTC,"Heya thank you...I will do just that.  So Boise isn't a po-dunk, 1 cow town that I can breeze through in an hour?

We've got a lot of parks, trails and a big greenbelt running along the river where you'll find people walking, jogging and riding bikes.  All in all, Boise is a pretty peaceful place. It can be too quiet for some, but I think there's something for just about anyone here.  If you are  politically conservative, you'll find yourself in one of the most conservative states in the Union. If you are liberal, Boise is probably the most liberal spot in the state.

I know that selective breeding does fall under the GMO category and makes up a portion of it, but as far as the debate between good vs bad goes, everyone's focus is on the GMOs that have been unnaturally altered in a lab, I feel, rather than selective breeding."

There are a lot of really great things about the city: The people, the food, the thriving craft beer/wine/spirits industry, the green belt, the festivals, the botanical gardens, etc. But the most amazing, awe inspiring experiences I've had here have been in the wilderness. I don't know if you'll have time but I'd recommend a trip to Stanley and a hike to Sawtooth lake, and a soak at Gold Bug hot springs. It's probably an overnight trip but it's one of my favorite experiences in this state. If you like the outdoors, this is some of the best our state has to offer, but there is a lot more where that came from. For a quick taste, you could also try the hike to Stack Rock, it's about a 25 minute drive from Boise and during the late spring/early summer, it is gorgeous with its shaded paths, wild lilies, coral bells and ferns."

Boise,33g1gn,throwinglemons,3,Wed Apr 22 17:28:19 2015 UTC,"I posted this to see what the general mood might be with us coming. We do all types of events primarily in the Phoenix area, recently doing two days for Phoenix Pride. Probably some of the wildest crowds we have ever had. We have done several events not officially tied to Arizona State, but near their campus, and I will agree, college crowds are ""different"". A lot of what determines the feel of the show is the music and DJ. The Spring Fling will not be typical for us, because the students were able to request music. The DJ we are bringing is very talented, and should be able to satisfy the requests while pushing the envelope. I am actually really excited for this event, as we have a few extra surprises that I wasn't aware of until yesterday.  As for the motivation, sure Walter Productions is a for profit business. These cars are not cheap to build and to be honest, we love to bring them out to play with them. If someone wants to hire us and our cars for an event, and it fits with who we are and what we do (just trying to put smiles on peoples faces) then yeah, we love to do that. We are also heading out to Bonnaroo come June.  While we have accommodations, I know our group would love to meet any local burners, makers and creative people. Its a pretty diverse group, from the tech side of audio and lighting engineering to the makers who can build and fabricate practically anything. I'm sure they would love to see a future art car!!! Please PM me some information on Xanadu, and hopefully we can meet up somehow. We arrive on Friday and Leave Sunday so it's a quick trip. Trust me, I don't take your words in a mean way. I appreciate your thoughts. I'm sometimes curious to see how we come off to other people. I know who we are and what a great group we have, and our intentions, but for those who don't know us, I hope we can reach out and connect. I'd love to meet all of you this weekend. I'm hoping to grab a beer at Bar Guernica Friday night… worth it?"

Boise,33dpv1,darkstar999,3,Wed Apr 22 15:49:30 2015 UTC,"Not that it excuses the behavior, but the federal government using funding as a motivation for states is a pretty common tactic.  The thing to keep in mind is that the federal government ultimately calls the shots. As you may recall a war was fought on the subject and the Union/Feds ""won"" (if 620,000 dead Americans can be considered a victory). There's been quite a bit of back and forth since then, but ultimately the federal government trumps the states.   Another thing to consider is that while the federal government might seem like a bully at times by threatening to withhold funding, the reality for a lot of states (including Idaho) is that they are a net beneficiaries of the federal system. Specifically, the amount of money leaving the state in the form of federal taxes vs. the amount of federal funds returning to the state through a variety of federal programs (Link). So while we may not always agree with the federal government, and it is out right to challenge its actions through democratic and judicial channels...we are ultimately direct beneficiaries of the federal government's lagresse."

Boise,32fu59,SecretBurrito,3,Wed Apr 15 02:03:48 2015 UTC,"$1000 or under is really cutting it tight.  You won't be able to get any professional venues really for under $1500 from personal experience.  If you're shooting for a cheap (summer) wedding, check out renting a shelter house at Lucky Peak state park or other shelter houses in the area.  Usually these can be rented for somewhere under $200 for multiple hours.  The only drawback is that they close at sunset and all of your guests have to be gone by then (which is around 10ish in the summer).  The only other option to really cut costs on a venue would be to try and have your wedding in a national park or find someone with a very large back yard that will let you get married there.  Even with a really cheap venue (let's say <$100), you will be nickel and dimed with chair/table rentals, food, music, lighting, dress attire, flowers, and photography.

""Good evening folks, we got a call about loitering in the parking lot here, is everything ok here do you need any help? No? OK, I'll have to ask you to disperse.""

Only a fraction of them are front-page news.    A murdering officer in one state doesn't mean a completely different officer in another state is probably going to murder you.   That's just wrong statistically.     People overestimate the prevalence of violence generally.   There's plenty of science supporting that.   This leads to all kinds of group biases against occupational groups, racial groups, and geographic areas.   People are more afraid of getting shot by a black man or a police officer than they are getting killed in a car accident, even though the odds of the latter happening is many, many times more likely."

Boise,3274pt,el_pinata,2,Sat Apr 11 16:44:55 2015 UTC,"From the 2007 Hague Convention Treaty on Recovery of International Child Support, found here:    Article 22 Grounds for refusing recognition and enforcement   Recognition and enforcement of a decision may be refused if - a) recognition and enforcement of the decision is manifestly incompatible with the public policy (""ordre public"") of the State addressed;"
Boise,3274pt,BACK_BURNER,1 point,Sat Apr 11 13:38:03 2015 UTC,"Here's how you get around that - the article addresses French (among others) child support policies that may recognize rights granted or prior decisions made in quasi legal bodies (Sharia courts, etc). Abiding by French policy, which is distinctly Western, doesn't require acknowledgment of how or why it grants status/rights/recognition, only that it does. Thus it's easier to pursue a domestic policy that a) is Hague-friendly, and b) gives the state power to collect child support based on decisions made internationally.  ...at least that's how I'd argue against dismantling our system, if I thought the idiot lawmakers weren't being all OMG MUSLIMS and using those fears as pretext for political action."
Boise,3274pt,el_pinata,2,Sun Apr 12 00:09:46 2015 UTC,I believe there is a due process exemption that allows Idaho judges to determine if due process was followed before granting an order of enforcement.  EDIT: And it should be kept in mind that no county that operates under sharia law is a signatory to the convention.

A bell hop was shot down on an elevator and people have reported sightings of him. Many workers who were working on the renovation on the building quit because the paranormal activity was too much. The Owyhee plaza hotel has also been thought to be haunted not much has been said other than reports of apparitions in the basement and guest bedrooms. The fort boise cemetery also has some very similar reports of haunting that cotton wood has. (They could very well be the same cemetery)  good hauntings!

Boise,31s5ny,ericn1300,4,Thu Apr 9 04:20:19 2015 UTC,"I have some pics from under the Egyptian theater. I'll post them here tonight if I remember. Also so pics from a old slaughter house by eagle island I can post.  EDIT: https://imgur.com/3zogMVd,kYSIwag,ZXICqQo,gHAabym,7SCv6MR,PdR19VY,BlNaKIw,4zSPYSq,Odjc8o6,Mtc8Rd1,nHHMVTR,Z4b5abq,Wi6tfYH,YByG1cp,Qm3zMDc#14  I wont lie most theses pictures are pretty shitty. They were taken with my phone in the dark and I really wasn't sure if I was allowed to be doing it so they were quick snaps.  From what I understand the supposed ""tunnels"" are just ventilation for the theater. There was one sealed shut area but whats behind it is pure speculation for me.There is one tunnel that runs from under center stage to the end of the lower seating right about where the mezzanine starts. It's currently used for cable runs during concerts. If you've ever sat in the lower part of the theater you may have noticed floor vents. The tunnel is directly beneath these. This is where ghosts sit and stare at your crotch.  There was another tunnel on the west side of the theater but it just dead ended if I remember correctly. On the east side is storage, an ""office"", some HVAC stuff and a sealed off door.  A lot of people talk about a ghost that lives in the theater and makes appearances at night. Personally I'm not one for superstitions but it is definitely a little spooky down there. I've heard people confirm that there was tunnels under Boise, but there are supposedly very few that traveled short distance and are now sealed shut. I've never read about or heard a viable source of Opium dens, orgies or any other weird stories."

When I'd prepare the meals alone in the kitchen, doors would open and shut on their own, even after being locked. The old radio would turn on by itself and tune itself to the Christian station.

It takes a while to navigate through their voicemail system, but when I found an injured baby squirrel in my yard, I eventually I got a recording there with Toni's phone number.  She's the local squirrel rescuer and an amazing person.     The squirrel could be a gonner, but he could just be in shock.  The best thing to do if he's still there is to put him in a shoebox with lots of bedding, and ideally, some ziplock bags filled with warm water.   And then change the water every few hours until you can get a hold of someone, or until he dies.   I posted about my Boise squirrel adventure story in /r/squirrels (and was greeted by indifference).  It's a pretty common deal around here, to come across an inured squirrel, with so many of them here in such an urban environment.

I think I'm going to get him a box with some warm blankets and take it to West Vet. Just bums me out that it's going to have a super scary for it last 30 min of it's life.   I'm going to do a little googling on if squirrels like peanut butter or coconut oil or something to put in there with it so it can at least have some tasty snacks in it's feared state.

Aside from Legends there really isn't another restaurant, they all exist off the campus (Twin Peaks, Black Bear, etc..) The real problem is not why would I go there, but why would a go before the movie starts, why would I stay after the movie is over and why would I go there if I'm not going to a movie. It has been sold as Edwards Cinema Multiplex and that's what they got, a movie theater, not a social hub.  Live music, some small shops, multiple sit down restaurants, etc..."

Drivers also would have to maintain personal insurance on their vehicles.  Read more here: http://www.idahostatesman.com/2015/02/25/3663067_boise-discusses-specifics-for.html?rh=1#storylink=cpy"

Boise,31p1af,spudster23,0,Tue Apr 7 22:51:21 2015 UTC,they get to make their own rules   Not true at all. The state legislature could have ignored or voted against the bill.

You still have to pay the taxi separately.  Uber: set pickup location, hit request button. (additional step to set up credit card if you have never done it). Payment is through Uber so you don't have to worry about a tip or even having your wallet.  Phone: call cab company or driver, tell them an address and time for pickup"
Boise,31p1af,CrucifiedKitten,-2,Wed Apr 8 00:43:52 2015 UTC,I try explaining this sort of thing to people. You can say Uber makes better opportunities for the drivers as they become an owner/operator but Boise has to be the easiest city in America to get a cab license. I do see how sometimes it can save a decent amount of money when going to Meridian or Nampa but people should demand better public transit options with later hours instead of demanding the choice between a Lincoln Town and County or black Escalade with 3rd row seating. Maybe things will change when people stop thinking Uber makes them hip and with it.
Boise,31p1af,CrucifiedKitten,8,Tue Apr 7 14:52:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I only take Uber because it makes me hip and with it. Not because it saves me money, and I can track the car, and the car is nicer, and the drivers get rated, and I don't have to tip, and the drivers say they make more money in less hours than taxi driving.  Glad you thought this through.  Edit: Boise should have had way better public transport decades ago. Uber is finally helping to somewhat fix that hole."
Boise,31p1af,4pool,-4,Tue Apr 7 15:36:56 2015 UTC,"Do you buy cheap Chinese goods at Wal-Mart to save money as well? You can go online and see the ratings! Now, I did say it can make better opportunities for the drivers but we haven't examined any externalities. How many drivers have broken down additional costs like the avg $0.56 a mile it takes to drive a car or how much they will pay on their 1099 at the end of the year. Also, driver count is currently low, how much will they make once the supply increases? How about lost income for AHCD on maintaining roads or city services like traffic enforcement? As for my ""hip and with it"" comment, I see this kind of behavior all the time. As someone who travels for work, many times people will opt to take Uber than walk 4 block to their hotel. Then proceed to talk about how cool Uber is for the next 20 minutes. My main point was people are in the wrong fight for bad reasons and we should demand things locally instead of being an angry mob for corporation. Glad you thought that through."
Boise,31p1af,ickeePoo,6,Tue Apr 7 17:00:57 2015 UTC,"Um yeah...I do. Actually I much rather use Amazon (the hippest and coolest of them all). I buy cheap shit that works great (like those $30 fold out tables), and high quality stuff when I need it to last (like boots).  As for drivers taking their jobs under serious consideration, that's between them and Uber. If the numbers don't work, Uber won't last.  Better local transport has been in demand for decades. Everyone in Boise knows that.  I don't really see any points here to think about. Boise should have provided better transportation decades ago, and taxi services should have been working on their own apps years ago."

Boise,31mjet,MrStickers,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:58:33 2015 UTC,"I hate those overpasses so much. The design is so stupid, there was a similar overpass like that in Phoenix, but it had a round about on each side. It ran like butter! (google maps link)  First thing that came to mind moving back was there are very, very few 3 lane roads in Boise. Most seem to be 2 lane and 35-40. In Phoenix most side streets were 3 lanes and 45."

They can be confusing at first but other than that I don't see what the problem is. I think the meridian overpass could be different though, because it'll see so much more traffic.    When you say side streets are 3 lanes, do you mean 2 lanes in opposite directions with the middle turn lane/suicide lane?"
Boise,31mjet,MrStickers,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:29:16 2015 UTC,"lol, suicide lane. XD No, 3 lanes going each way, island with trees\grass in the middle, then a right hand lane for merging at most intersections. At stop lights (on the side of town I lived on) it wasn't uncommon to have 6 lanes each direction. 2 left, 3 straight, 1 right. That area has fully embraced the idea of no left hand turns across traffic but rather you go past your intended stop, make U turn at the next light and turn right on you way back. It took awhile to grow on me, but I like it."
Boise,31mjet,HiccupMaster,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:34:02 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, so more like Eagle road, it's a no left turn all u turn but the road still sucks.   I thought you were talking more about the normal lower traffic roads near subdivisions."

Boise,31mjet,MrStickers,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:12:17 2015 UTC,In Phoenix I worked 10 miles from my house and it took me about 20 mins to drive to work on the 8-5 shift. Driving from Meridian to Boise takes forever in that same time slot. :(
Boise,31mjet,encephlavator,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:12:49 2015 UTC,"Meridian to Boise by the freeway? That's construction related. That will be done by the end of the year, iirc. After completion that trip will be smooth sailing until the 13th St light backup.   But no, traffic wasn't always that bad. Boise has added about 200 to 300k people in the last 15 to 20 years, which is phenomenal growth for such a small city. The area and the State were not prepared for the growth as someone else mentioned. The current freeway work was only possible due to the creative financing called GARVEE Bonds concocted by former Gov Kempthorne who was also a former Mayor of Boise. No way in heck Otter would have ever come up with Garvee Bonds."

I have NEVER had any problem turning onto Vet from State St, but all the idiots who HAVE to have their Starbucks in the morning and try to turn in there completely jack the inbound commute traffic up.  This is a joke to me.  They should just put a barrier up so people CAN'T turn into Starbucks and leave it at that. They can drive up a few blocks and take their chances.   Also, there are way bigger problems with State Street than this. For starters the lights' timing is completely screwy. It is very common to be sitting at a red light waiting, while the next light is green, and it turns red as soon as your light turns green."

Boise,311zm3,DontStopRereading,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:49:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's kind of hard to picture but I think it will work. Part of the issue is stacking. The extended left turn will provide much more room to stack left turners. Because of Clover Drive the current left turn bays cannot be extended back to the east much more.

I'll take him at his word that original arrest was bogus: sometimes cops make mistakes, sometimes cops are assholes.  But rather than saying things like ""This was an illegal arrest, I intend to fight these charges, my rights of assembly and speech were violated, I am considering legal action against Officer Brockbank, The Boise Police Department, and The City of Boise"" etc. what he essentially said was ""If the charges aren't dropped at the hearing tomorrow I will be singling out the arresting officer for harassment. Nothing violent, mind you, but I'll do my best to cause him trouble where he lives and in all media I have access to.""   To me, that sounds like threatening a witness prior to a legal hearing: ""If I don't get my way something bad is going to happen to you."""

Boise,30uz5c,hatchettchris,2,Tue Mar 31 23:23:21 2015 UTC,"IANAL but I don't think it has to be violent to run afoul of witness intimidation laws; the key is the threat.  That being said, it seems like a case could be made, at least to this layman"
Boise,30uz5c,Naznarreb,6,Tue Mar 31 15:02:08 2015 UTC,Just went to his facebook profile and he was the one who wrote his sign when he was running for Coroner to look like blood.   Link: http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/04/18/3139993/ada-candidates-sign-turns-heads.html

Boise,30uz5c,jurisnipper,2,Wed Apr 1 19:03:41 2015 UTC,"FWIW, here's the relevant statute.  It does not require a threat of violence, or even a threat at all.   Of course, the defense will argue that the statute violates his First Amendment rights.   You have a right to publicly complain about a charge against you, obviously, but does that extend to ""I know where you live"" kind of stuff, where the defendant claims his retribution will be non-violent (but annoying).    Whatever exactly he is threatening to do, it involves the officer's home, and the officer's family, and I think those are the toughest facts for his defense.  If the initial obstruction arrest was unlawful, I'd fight that first - if he can beat that charge, and even better, prove the officer was wrong, he'll have a lot more sympathy.  http://legislature.idaho.gov/idstat/Title18/T18CH26SECT18-2604.htm  ""Any person who, by direct or indirect force, or by any threats to person or property, or by any manner wilfully intimidates, influences, impedes, deters, threatens, harasses, obstructs or prevents, a witness, including a child witness, or any person who may be called as a witness or any person he believes may be called as a witness in any criminal proceeding or juvenile evidentiary hearing from testifying freely, fully and truthfully in that criminal proceeding or juvenile evidentiary hearing is guilty of a felony."""
Boise,30uz5c,morosco,3,Tue Mar 31 05:25:21 2015 UTC,"I'm glad someone could word it far better than me. It's ridiculous that people don't deem ""I know where you live and I'll make your neighborhood's lifestyle a living hell if these charges aren't dropped"" as a threat. Threatening someone doesn't just involve harming them."
Boise,30uz5c,zetswei,1 point,Tue Mar 31 06:50:07 2015 UTC,...pretty sure what he's threatening to do would fit comfortably under harassment. Not sure how he plans to argue that annoying them via peaceful protest isn't harassment

Boise,30uz5c,zetswei,-2,Tue Mar 31 20:38:51 2015 UTC,The action he's threatening is protesting and hanging door hangers. That's just getting out the word. It's speech.

Boise,30uz5c,janicuda,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:21:31 2015 UTC,Well apparently focus of his rage isn't a joke if it's enough to get a felony charge for it. Even if his rage is expressed by hanging door hangers and holding a sign.

Boise,30uetf,darkstar999,4,Mon Mar 30 20:13:11 2015 UTC,We had these yellow bikes in the 90s. They all disappeared soon after launch. Some were found in the canals.
Boise,30uetf,janicuda,3,Mon Mar 30 22:17:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've heard of that one, but modern bikeshares require a credit card, so the person renting is accountable for returning it. If it works in NYC (citibike), it will definitely work here."
Boise,30uetf,Whitebeard,3,Mon Mar 30 22:26:41 2015 UTC,"I've used the citibike in NYC a few times and it's amazing! I'm a little worried about how well it will turn out in Boise though. I can already see a few problems compared to citibike:   NYC is huge! (population wise) It has a ton of tourists and millions of people commuting back and forth. Boise does .... not exactly have those kinds of numbers. NYC is huge! (distance wise) There is tons of room and alleys there to have bike stations. It's worth it to pick up a bike and cruise to the other side because it's too far to walk. Boise (metropolitan) on the other hand is quite small. I can walk across downtown if I need to. I don't see any locations other than downtown that have enough people that it would be widely used. Everyone I know here has a bike. In NYC people live in small apartments and don't have tons of room to toss a bike in their living place. Lots of people here have big yards and garages. This will take away from the people that would use it.   That said, I still wish the program the best."
Boise,30uetf,Oldschool64bus,3,Tue Mar 31 05:11:47 2015 UTC,I remember seeing them in random yard and odd places all over haha. Ofncourse they were cheap ass bikes to begin with.
Boise,30uetf,dregan,3,Tue Mar 31 00:13:07 2015 UTC,"Woah, they have a shaft drive. I've never seen that before. Can you leave them anywhere within the dotted line for the $2 up charge?"
Boise,30uetf,vietdemocracy,2,Tue Mar 31 03:23:30 2015 UTC,"Curious about that myself, like if they have their own lock and can still communicate to the greenbike servers for another rider to unlock them. Because right now, all the hubs are in pretty close walking distances and for someone who doesn't mind walking, there is no need for me to use this."
Boise,30uetf,dregan,2,Tue Mar 31 13:35:17 2015 UTC,"I bet there will be since there is a ""Bikes out of hubs"" marker on the map. They could do this easily with a dynamo hub, a battery and something like the bikespike"
Boise,30uetf,Kou9992,2,Tue Mar 31 14:18:14 2015 UTC,Does anyone have a use case for this? When/where would you find yourself downtown with a need for one of these bikes?
Boise,30uetf,vietdemocracy,3,Mon Mar 30 20:28:24 2015 UTC,"Recreational riding seems like the only consistent usage I could imagine. $70 a year for an hour a day of riding on the Greenbelt without having to purchase a bike or worry about bike storage or maintenance seems like a pretty good deal as long as you don't go over your daily free limit.  Considering where the hubs are and the $4 an hour pricing, I can't imagine using this because you actually want to get somewhere."
Boise,30uetf,supinterwebs,2,Mon Mar 30 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"If Uber comes back I could see the bikes being used less, its about $4 to get anywhere within the confines of that map. But totally agree about people wanting to ride around the get exercise."

Boise,30uetf,ECE113,2,Tue Mar 31 21:04:26 2015 UTC,"The out-of-town market is where Boise GreenBike will excel, I think. Currently visitors have to find a loaner bike, or borrow a car, both of which are unreliable. Visitors to the convention center in particular might opt for a bike share over renting a car or riding the bus. When I've traveled cycling has been one of the best ways to get around, in particular in New Orleans, where roads are narrow, cabs are expensive and the night life warrants exploring."

Boise,30v8zg,jessebuynothing,5,Mon Mar 30 23:55:00 2015 UTC,"I am no coffee snob but here's what's most popular for local shops.  Dawson Taylor on 8th and Bannock: omnipresent in the Boise breakfast world. Do yourself a favor and stop by adjoining zeppole's bakery for a cinnamon twig while you're at  it.   Flying M (5th/Idaho St) is another local favorite. I go there the most but more for ambience and free refills mostly.   Java (I'm pretty sure it's local, Google confirms-seems strange it's the number one on Google) in either Hyde Park or downtown are also usually packed.  Rembrandts is a cool spot in an old church in old Eagle (about a 15 min drive from downtown Boise) . I have only been there once but know the owners do a lot of good for the refugee community here.  Nekar is a new pour over coffee stand but usually at events and festivals only as far as I know. Probably will be at the Boise Farmers market.  For food hard to tell without knowing what you like but if your anything like our foodie friends from LA:  foodie places:  The Modern hotel- definitely St Lawrence Gridiron-American revival  Dish  If you wanna spend a bit more: 29th and Lemp   Lotsa people will say Fork. Not my favorite.  For burgers (probably going to get a lot of shit for this list):  definitely  Boise Fry Co downtown.  West side Drive in- (even though I see that picture of that bleach haired turd from the food network's face on the drive through display I lose my appetite)  Pizza: Flying Pie for sure, Piehole for 2am heaven, Guidos if you're into the whole authenticity thing.  Classy pub food: Cloud 9 Brewery Bittercreek  Brunch: Juniper  Red feather  Deli: Bleubird  Asian: Pho neaveau or MaiThai  Writing this I realize that I definitely eat out way too much."
Boise,30v8zg,ChesterJLampick,3,Tue Mar 31 00:53:41 2015 UTC,The Modern has a well tuned espresso machine.  Janjou is probably going to have some of the best pulls of espresso in town.

It's an awesome little joint with great coffee and a superb breakfast, but probably the best part is the atmosphere.  My favorite places:  Top dollar: Chandler's. There's no substitute. I had a $40 ribeye that changed my life a week ago.  Mid dollar: The Fork. Chester doesn't like it but the menu is so eccentric that you're bound to find something you like. For example, I love their take on chipotle steak and avocado enchiladas.  Bottom dollar: Merritt's Country Cafe. Open all night, stop by and get their world-famous scones when everywhere else is closed.  Chinese: Yen Ching downtown is classy and authentic. Like a neighborhood PF Chang's without the dark atmosphere.  Mexican Fast Food: Los Betos. It's really the only game in town but it's every bit as good as the great stuff I've been shown in San Diego.  Indian: The Bombay Grill downtown has a bomb lunch buffet. Plus they are in a really cool old bank building.  Seafood (Really? Yes): Lucky Fins downtown has fresh fish flown in daily and a really good sushi menu. Chandler's does the same thing but of course is more expensive.  Sushi: Mt. Fuji. There's a bunch of Japanese guys my dad used to work with - when they would fly over from Japan, this one guy who was a big sushi fanatic (who was also the director of HP in Japan) would refuse to eat anything but Mt. Fuji and would have a guy running back and forth from the restaurant at all times."

Boise,30v8zg,franalpo,3,Thu Apr 2 04:12:10 2015 UTC,"Boise has been covered really well but nothing much mentioned in Meridian-  My favorite breakfast/brunch in the Treasure Valley is at Moe Joe's on Overland close to Eagle. Their hash bowls are to die for, and my husband swears by the lemon poppy seed pancakes, while I love the ones stuffed with cream cheese and served with berry jalapeño syrup! When you order a hash bowl you can substitute a pancake for the toast that comes with it for only a dollar or two more.   My favorite coffee shop, Groove Coffee, is also in Meridian, at Locust Grove and Fairview. The coffee is good, though I don't think they use any particularly fancy roasters. I love it mainly because of the super friendly new owner and the great vibe of the place. If it's slow when you go in he'll do a pour over for you (won't when it's busy because he's the sole employee at the moment).   Some of the places mentioned by other people also have Meridian locations, like Pie Hole and Boise Fry Company, and possibly others.   The Village in Meridian is relatively new and is home to many fancy and probably overpriced restaurants. I haven't been to many of them but I did have a great burrito last week at the little place in the glass building by the fountain - Calle 75 Tacos. Probably some of the best food prices in The Village. I recommend the Surf and Turf burrito with their chile oil and a cup of amazing Bucksnort homemade root beer.   The best Mac and cheese I've ever had is at Edge Brewing, which is on Steelhead way, near the mall (not Meridian, but closer than most of the other places mentioned which are mainly downtown Boise). They have several amazing varieties; I love the buffalo chicken mac.   Have a great time here!"

I was disappointed in general that there wasn't more to go see because I enjoy Boise so much (saw the Boist St vs. New Mexico game which was fantastic), but this museum was ruled out immediately because I don't support the concept.   Would anyone happen to be able to recommend museums to visit for the next time I'm in town? I didn't really discover any and I endeavor to try again next time we're in town. Any topic non-church affiliated would be suitable to me. I've been to the old Idaho State Penitentiary before and did enjoy that."

Boise,30lym9,Nichijo,2,Mon Apr 6 00:41:00 2015 UTC,I went to San Antonio Texas for a PAX convention and used Uber the entire time while there after a terrible cab experience. Not only was it more affordable but the cars and drivers were nicer. I guess I don't see why the company receives so much hate.
Boise,30lym9,SillyKitty88,2,Mon Mar 30 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"The hate is from their ""Uber the law"" attitude. They come with bags of money, and barge into an existing industry that's worked by people who thought they ought to ... y'know, ""Follow the existing laws"".   All these comments about the drivers being nicer, and the cars being better are irrelevant anecdotes, combined with some stereotyping. The slam-dunk will come IF Uber becomes the monopoly on the industry that they pretentiously claim to be ""the answer"" to. When that happens, all those offensive cab drivers and all those dirty cabs will become Uber. The only difference is that a few politically aggressive people will become billionaires.   I'm just waiting for Uber to enter the prostitution industry. Their whores will be much hotter than the streetwalkers they used to be, before they got strongarmed out of free-lancing by a convenient change in the laws. But apps are awesome!"
Boise,30lym9,Nichijo,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:04:30 2015 UTC,If you get too low of a rating (as a driver) you can no longer drive for uber. The rating that drivers get are private and the driver can't see it. Uber drivers can also rate riders and make comments. These are also not seen by riders.

Boise,30dk0k,DrBurtRenolds,2,Thu Mar 26 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"I had an awful experience with CenturyLink.  Their sales people were doing door to door sales for new service in my area and I decided to sign up as they claimed their throughput was much better than CableOne's at $15 cheaper per month, no set up fees, and informed me that they had a 30 day money back guarantee.  On the activation day, the technician came out and hooked everything up and tested, but told me instead of getting 40Mbps that I was guaranteed, their lines would only offer 15Mbps.  I made 3 calls to their tech support department and sales department complaining about this, and after extensive troubleshooting they said they would need to send a tech back out to investigate and that I would be charged for his visit.  The soonest the technician was available was 5 days from the call, so I decided to cancel and go with CableOne.  The CableOne techs were able to make it out 2 days later for the initial setup, tested everything on site, and verified I was getting the speeds that I signed up for.  It's a little more expensive to use CableOne, but I think it's worth it due to the amount of hassle I dealt with when I tried CenturyLink, plus you're not locked into a contract like CenturyLink.  The kicker for all of this though was immediately after I cancelled my plan with CenturyLink, I shipped back the modem they had sent to me.  3 weeks later I receive two letters in the mail, one saying that I owed $34.95 for my service and another saying that I hadn't shipped back my equipment yet.  I had to call in once more to deal with this and get these charges revoked (with the 30 day money back guarantee) and ensure that they had received the equipment that I mailed back.  I will never use CenturyLink again as long as it can be avoided.  YMMV"

Boise,300cwz,SupremeGunman,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:12:04 2015 UTC,"Recycling centers pay for aluminum, so you're not likely to find any place that will give it away.  Your best bet is to go to some of the smaller food joints and offer to setup a recycling bin for cans.  A lot of smaller businesses don't have the time to recycle,but you'll probably have to buy the bins yourself, and you'll also have to sort plastic from aluminum, and then you might have to check on it daily and empty it, so is it really worth all the effort as opposed to just buying bulk aluminum?"

Its possible that my experience is an outlier, but I feel like Brewforia was a real gateway to a lot of the world's great beers, and to see that disappear so suddenly raises a lot of questions, especially in light of Grind's ambitious plans to become a national chain.

Boise,2zl4is,blac9570,3,Fri Mar 20 12:47:47 2015 UTC,"I understand your point (and upvoted you) but I hate that line of reasoning. A foul is a foul is a foul.

Boise,2zl402,I_Minored_In,0,Fri Mar 20 01:10:41 2015 UTC,Hmm and they still decide to give him the ball for isolation with 3 minutes left... tired of Coach Rice's play calling when the game is close
Boise,2zl440,catpooptv,5,Thu Mar 19 14:13:41 2015 UTC,"You don't call that foul at the end of the game especially with the offensive player trying to draw the foul, it was a good no call.   It was Boise's game to loose last night in the second half when they lost a 10 point lead. They could have had a much better possession prior to having to use their time out which put them in a bad place to inbound the ball. It all boils down to inexperience in crunch time.   As far as calls go it did seem like Boise was getting called for a bunch of tic tack fouls, I admire that they didn't openly complain to the refs it does show some good composure but you gotta know when to pull back and the coach should have stepped in more.   There is always next year Boise"
Boise,2zl440,franalpo,1 point,Thu Mar 19 14:21:51 2015 UTC,It comes down to Rice being a terrible coach in crunch time. 2014 and 2015 season was the same shit. We have a lead and we abandon our office for an isolation play.. with 3 minutes left.
Boise,2zl440,Mastacon,2,Thu Mar 19 15:44:49 2015 UTC,"I think you're right.  Boise St. blew a lead, couldn't get a good shot at the end, and then tried to will the refs to bail them out.  I'm assuming that part at the end was just desperation rather than an actual plan, but they were in that position because Dayton outplayed them and forced that spot."
Boise,2zl440,morosco,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:25:15 2015 UTC,"Rice loves to throw his offense away at the end of games and go isolation, which is great for the opposing team."
Boise,2zl440,Mastacon,1 point,Thu Mar 19 14:57:31 2015 UTC,And then there was that play where they almost lost the ball out of bounds - again going away from the basket and getting trapped in a terrible spot.    Those last few possessions were just bad.  And they wouldn't have been as close as they were if Dayton didn't crap the bed from the foul line.

Boise,2z9t2v,quinnperry,5,Mon Mar 16 20:54:28 2015 UTC,"Whatcha talkin about? It just passed the House Floor so now it heads to the Senate...(same bill, including the number)."
Boise,2z9t2v,quinnperry,3,Mon Mar 16 21:19:27 2015 UTC,So the Senate calls it H0262? I always thought that they came up with their own bill number.
Boise,2z9t2v,quinnperry,4,Mon Mar 16 21:24:55 2015 UTC,"They might get a new number if it gets sent to the Amending order, which is possible. There are a lot of really unhappy people about this Uber bill. I can understandably see why people love Uber (it is a brilliant service) but there has to be some outlined regulation (like insurance coverage and background checks...which is why the City was struggling with it to begin with). The debate in the committee had solid arguments to why it needed to be held in committee and they snuck this bill through like a greased pig, again across party lines. It was just a print hearing and got shoved through as if it was a printed bill. Legislators love to hate the Federal Government but then they turn around and tell the city how to run their Government. edit: words  That's just my .02 cents."
Boise,2z9t2v,quinnperry,6,Mon Mar 16 21:26:44 2015 UTC,"insurance coverage and background checks   Those are both addressed in the bill, what don't you like about it?   really unhappy people about this Uber bill.   Who? Taxi drivers?  As I have said before in this sub, I don't agree with everything that Uber does, but they should have the freedom to operate here."
Boise,2z9t2v,Redemptions,5,Mon Mar 16 21:36:43 2015 UTC,"Ha, well, one might think that one line of ""they must have insurance"" just about covers it but what you and others may not realize is the question of when insurance picks up and how much coverage is required. Taxis in Idaho are required to purchase a minimum of $500 thousand dollar insurance policy which is always kicked in and covers passengers, drivers, and people who may have been injured by (but outside) the Taxi. Idaho only has requires 25/50 insurance minimums, meaning if someone with minimum insurance hits you then only $25,000 of medical costs are covered ($50,000 total if there are more than one persons injured in the vehicle). I don't know when the last time you were in an emergency room for something semi-serious, but $25,000 likely isn't going to cover a serious hospitalization. UBER does have a $1 million dollar policy but that's only activated once passengers are in the car. You're right that UBER does do some kind of background checks but they don't want to pay the extra money to get the more extensive ones that are required of all the other Taxi Cab drivers, etc. by the city of Boise. UBER is a bully and I'm just not a fan of when corporations get to call the shots. edit: words since you asked me additional questions."
Boise,2z9t2v,dodadoBoxcarWilly,3,Mon Mar 16 21:57:11 2015 UTC,"Taxis in Idaho are required to purchase a minimum of $500 thousand dollar insurance policy  UBER does have a $1 million dollar policy   So Uber's requirement is double that of Idaho's and you have a problem with that?   only activated once passengers are in the car.   Not entirely true, there is additional insurance in case the driver's personal insurance is denied:   During the time that a ridesharing partner is available but between trips, most personal auto insurance will provide coverage. However the driver is also backed by an additional policy that covers driver liability for bodily injury up to $50,000/individual/accident with a total of $100,000/accident and up to $25,000 for property damage.    Again, double the State requirement of 25/50.  If I start a business delivering flowers, what kind of car insurance does the State require?"
Boise,2z9t2v,BSUbluNorange,2,Mon Mar 16 22:02:08 2015 UTC,"Right but the question/argument is WHEN does the policy kick in? And the drivers' personal insurance might be the bare minimum (as it often is with insurance).  If you are driving a vehicle for commercial purposes, Insurance companies will likely require that you carry a higher policy. That IS for the safety of you and other people. edit: I'm done arguing this now. You're reading off the UBER blog which doesn't necessarily apply to every single state."
Boise,2z9t2v,Bennyboy1337,2,Mon Mar 16 22:12:56 2015 UTC,"WHEN does the policy kick in?   Check out the image on this page, it makes it pretty clear. http://blog.uber.com/ridesharinginsurance   Insurance companies will likely require that you carry a higher policy   Somewhat like Uber's $1 million policy?   You're reading off the UBER blog which doesn't necessarily apply to every single state.    **Effective as of March 14, 2014 in all U.S. states (the double asterisk applies to the between-rides insurance)"
Boise,2z9t2v,BSUbluNorange,2,Mon Mar 16 22:14:19 2015 UTC,I think the biggest problem 'people' had with it was that it is hard for the city to tax the piss out of.  Boise just wants their cut like everyone else.

Boise,2z9t2v,willsueforfood,5,Tue Mar 17 03:00:34 2015 UTC,"On the flip side it is the House's responsibility to override smaller municipal rulings if they find they are conflict with the states values/laws; I hate our politicians as much as everyone, but they are within every legal right to do what they did, it's no different then higher courts telling Idaho let the whole LGBT Marriage ban go; this is how the political pyramid works."
Boise,2z9t2v,Scipion,4,Tue Mar 17 14:14:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, then they ought to reduce the background check requirements for taxis as well and regulate the entire industry across the board."

Boise,2z9t2v,morosco,2,Thu Mar 19 05:10:55 2015 UTC,"From Uber:  Uber already voluntarily offers the following insurance protection:  ● $1MM in primary automobile liability coverage from the moment a driver accepts a ride request, is en route to pick up a requesting passenger and at all times a requesting passenger is in the car. This is double what is required of limos and taxis in the city.  ● Liability coverage of $50,000 for bodily injury per person up to $100,000 per incident when the app is on and a ride has not even been accepted in the event a driver’s personal policy denies coverage or coverage is otherwise unavailable. This is double the amount of coverage required for all motor vehicles under Idaho law. Put simply: There is no gap in coverage."
Boise,2z9t2v,morosco,2,Fri Mar 27 03:04:30 2015 UTC,Your (valid) opinion on Uber as a company shouldn't affect your opinion on how ridesharing companies should be regulated by the city. Just because Uber sucks doesn't mean that other companies shouldn't get a chance here.

If only because it's an actual professional soccer game in Boise, and that alone is a step in the right direction.   I'm worried that if Boise's soccer fans don't show up for this, it might take longer for us to get our own team because it will look like Boise just isn't interested in soccer, rather than just not interested in the teams playing.   Besides, we can always root for the Basque team! We have plenty of local Basque traditions, so why not? I'm sure it will still be a great game, and we can all get croquetas and kalimotxos at Bar Gernika after. :D"

Boise,2yybn4,rogowcop,0,Sat Mar 14 16:00:44 2015 UTC,"No, in fact Hawaii is having community hearings on how to fix an oversight when they legalized medical cannabis years ago. Their law allowed patients to grow their own, and that was the extent of it. In order to get seeds, a patient would have to break the law, and those unable to grow it would have had to buy it illegally. There was no provision for state dispensaries.   More generally, the states are legalizing it in all sorts of different ways. Most troubling is the influence of money that's suddenly reared its ugly head. It's actually surprising that nobody ever thought of it before, ""Hey, there's a TON of money to be made from legalized pot, IF we can structure the laws so that we have a legal monopoly"".  IOW, well-heeled investors with dollar signs dancing before their eyes, approach legislators with a Good Idea (that will generate some campaign contributions down the road).   We must NOT allow a legalization structure that makes it legal ONLY for large, well-financed operations to afford the licensing and bureaucratic requirements -- just to grow a plant.   So be careful! We could wind up with something worse than we already have."

You are required only to bring the humans over the age of 21 in your group who would like to play board games, and a desire to have fun with a great group of fellow redditors!  You don't need to bring anything else, unless you have a game you really want to play. Then you can bring that. :)  The games we play change from week to week, and we usually play at least 3 or so different games a night (even though we call attention to just one in the posts) so even if the featured game isn't your cup of tea, you can always check it out anyway because we will end up playing other things as well.

Boise,2yfu44,HiccupMaster,3,Fri Mar 13 17:03:12 2015 UTC,"I've used turbo tax many times in the past but just did it this year in TaxACT. While TaxACT isn't as slick as Turbo Tax, it is cheaper and TaxACT hasn't been caught (so far) lobbying against our interest of tax reform (if you care about that sort of thing).  Also, there is a way to have the IRS do your taxes for free as long as you make under 100K."

As long as you enter the questions honestly and don't fat finger the numbers you'll be fine.  Refunds come back really quickly. I use USAA for banking and I just gave Turbo Tax by account info and they dumped my refund right back into my account, no need for waiting for a check in the mail.  There's really nothing to be afraid about doing electronic taxes. Millions of people do it, and it's easy."

Yes, there are differences from breed to breed, but the difference from one dog to the next is mostly a matter of how the dog is handled.

Most adoption agencies also will give you sort of a trial period to make sure there aren't any immediate issues between animals and the home.  There's also Fuzzy Paws Rescue and Boise Bully Breed rescue. Despite their bad rep, ""bully breeds"" can actually be extremely good with other small animals and children.

Boise,2y65fo,yellowsubmarinr,4,Fri Mar 6 20:24:41 2015 UTC,"$30 a month until the special rate ends and it jumps up to $74. Plus Centurylink charges $30 for all of their plans initially, whether you get 1.5mbps, 40 mbps, or anything in between. So if you can't get 40 where you live, you won't be getting nearly as big of a discount with the special rate.  CableOne is $35 for 50mbps initially, then jumps to the standard rates OP listed."
Boise,2y65fo,Kou9992,3,Fri Mar 6 21:00:15 2015 UTC,"$30 a month until the special rate ends and it jumps up to $74   Once my initial contract was up, I spoke with their retention department and was able to get another year of 40/20 for $36 per month."
Boise,2y65fo,crazyk4952,3,Sat Mar 7 02:48:35 2015 UTC,"I just did this a couple weeks ago, it was no problem to get me another 12 months for $30/mo.  I don't find that I have problems with the speed either and haven't in the 3 locations I've had internet with them.  The problem with CenturyLink is their customer service. They'd be better off hiring untrained monkeys because then I would be able to anticipate and expect that I would only be getting shit thrown at me."
Boise,2y65fo,VanillaAphrodite,2,Sat Mar 7 08:27:50 2015 UTC,I get 40/5 for $20 from Centurylink after nine years of patronage. All I had to do was call them up and ask for it. That and put the payment on automatic withdrawal.

Also, their office is different the ""central office"" which is older technical term and is where telcos store equipment that uplinks the residential & business DSL customers to their highspeed network.  http://www.dslreports.com/coinfo/clli/BOISIDWE is a map showing the COs that exist in Ada county.  http://www.wap.org/journal/cotour/ is what a central office looks like.  Unsure of the age of those pictures, I haven't been into a CO in a long time.

Boise,2y65fo,BigScien,2,Fri Mar 6 21:30:18 2015 UTC,"For those that are curious, this is the DSLAM for my neighborhood. I see CL trucks parking in front of the cabinets several times per month.    Despite it being located in an alley directly across the street from my house, I am about 800 wire-feet from it and I qualify for the fastest speed that CL offers (60 down/30 up). I believe the maximum distance to get the fastest speed is around 1600 wire-feet."

Boise,2y65fo,Kou9992,3,Fri Mar 6 21:16:23 2015 UTC,"So what cable one employee is downvoting people for making comments that clearly contribute to the discussion? I left Cable one after one of their sales people told me they have no data caps, and I informed him that he was lying.   In Tacoma, due to Comcast's refusal to provide anything like decent service to the area in the late 90's, the city laid its own fiber optic network then started its own ISP. Low and behold, Comcast suddenly offered what is still the best value cable service I have ever used. Consistently better than anything you can get in Seattle. I know that the chances of Boise doing something similar are non existent, but it's something to think about. From what I understand Tacoma has made its money back already, well 15-20 years later, because companies rent the infrastructure to deliver service. Also, you have an actual choice of multiple cable internet providers in Tacoma due to the city owning the fiber lines as oppose to the isp owning it. Unless we are planning on Boise not being a city in 15-20 years, we should really consider doing this."
Boise,2y65fo,logiasin,2,Sat Mar 7 17:00:28 2015 UTC,"Also, sorry for the wall of text."
Boise,2y65fo,Kou9992,2,Fri Mar 6 20:23:02 2015 UTC,"You're lucky that you live in an area that has residential plans with those speeds. I had the same problem of going well over the soft data cap even though when I monitored my usage through my PC, I wasn't using anywhere near what CableOne was telling me I was using. Because of this, we had to 'upgrade' from the 50x3 residential service to the 30/2 Business service, which is more than twice as much as what we were previously paying just so we wouldn't have any data caps."
Boise,2y65fo,SilverStryfe,2,Fri Mar 6 20:53:46 2015 UTC,"Sad to hear this. At my current residence I went with the 20mb/s for $64 plan from Centurylink to avoid dealing with enforced data caps.  Now moving to a place where Centurylink only offers 3mb/s, I'm basically forced to go with CableOne."
Boise,2y65fo,DemureDuck,3,Fri Mar 6 21:02:51 2015 UTC,"CenturyLink does enforce their data caps though, plans over 1Mbps but under 1Gbps have a cap of 250GB/mo, and CenturyLink will terminate your service with them if you exceed that cap after receiving 2 warnings."
Boise,2y65fo,arnoldpalmerlemonade,1 point,Sat Mar 7 14:40:25 2015 UTC,"According to their EUP it's up to CenturyLink to decide if and when they will actually enforce it and I've always heard they are less likely to enforce than CableOne. Guess I've just gotten lucky. I regularly use 500GB+ and have hit over 1TB a few times on the 20Mbps pan and have yet to receive any warnings, though most of my usage is during off-peak hours."
Boise,2y65fo,MasterMarf,2,Sat Mar 7 20:13:07 2015 UTC,I ran into the same problem with streaming services.  Fixed it by lowering the quality on Netflix from 1080 (3GB/hour) to 720 (.7GB/hour).  haven't had a problem since.
Boise,2y65fo,snuxoll,1 point,Sat Mar 7 04:23:20 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it's too late for me to reduce the quality, they're quite firm that my only option is cancelation or the $100 plan.

Let's flourish. Let's stop reliving history over and over again. Woman's rights movement African American rights now it's gay rights and preventing people from being discriminated upon. How do we keep making the same mistakes. We have the history books read them and learn from them. The man came and spoke of freedom and equality. Not religious mumbo jumbo. Last I heard Christian's teach about acceptance and forgiveness and tolerance. I see NONE of that with those three republican bigots. It's only about THEM. Selfish children run this state.

We are still ironing out a couple details about the party but it will be in the next couple weeks. Stay tuned to when it will be by subscribing on our website leadbettercider.com or ""liking"" our Facebook page.  Darkstar999, since kickstarter is a crowd funding site the money we raise only gets charged to our supporters after the kickstarter has been successfully completed, so ""selling"" tickets to a sampling event as rewards to raise funds for our kickstarter on our kickstarter wouldn't work."

Until the internet, the only descriptions of “cross dressing” I was ever exposed to were a few pages in some rural-Idaho library books, and where the pages weren't cut out they all stated, with apparently clinical authority, that the only reason men dressed as women was because they derived sexual pleasure from it. Until recently it has not even been medically recognized that gender is property of a baby's brain, merely of the genitalia.  Given that most legislators are my age or older, that means that most have valid --seemingly scientifically-supported-- reason to believe that ATW is about masturbatory aids and mental illness, not civil rights. They believe they're doing the right thing, not only for straight Christians but also for the LGBT folk who might be able to get their life in order if society just wasn't so accepting of their illness.  Speaking from experience, that kind of good-faith belief doesn't go away with talking."

Boise,2xp3ro,encephlavator,2,Tue Mar 3 15:00:31 2015 UTC,"How far down the rabbit hole shall we go?   I've felt what you're feeling here. Given the choice between a world that makes sense and one that doesn't, all things being equal, we want the world that makes sense.  The problem comes in enforcing that surety on other people. You have to ask who's being hurt more. Yes, it sometimes means being uncertain about something you feel should be obvious, but the alternative is telling people like D.W. that ""no, I don't care if you're a girl, you have to be a boy."""
Boise,2xp3ro,principledsociopath,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"I feel that this narrative is similar to an Atheist's framing his argument against the existence of God through citing the Bible. It's illogical to disregard gender roles then use that same terminology to define new ones. It's my opinion and I do not feel it's derived out of judgement. I'm not interested in how other people view themselves, but if they are going to be argumentive and insistent that my opinion has to align with their's, then I'll make a fuss about it. So just because I don't agree with you doesn't mean that I would inflict suffering on these individuals. That line of thinking is a massive assumption on your part."
Boise,2xp3ro,encephlavator,2,Mon Mar 2 23:11:07 2015 UTC,"Your argument is essentially ""those are my words, stop using them"" and, ""as long as I never have to see it."" I don't need to have it explained to me; I grew up here in a church far stricter than yours.  Enforcing your opinion on other individuals by making a fuss about it is inflicting suffering on them. Calling them illogical and argumentative is a line of thinking completely derived out of judgement."
Boise,2xp3ro,principledsociopath,-2,Tue Mar 3 00:07:40 2015 UTC,"I thought I made it clear that I'm not interested in how other people see themselves. I only get piqued when someone insists that my opinion has to align with their's. Especially, when the begin to make assumptions about my opinion, like that it's motivated by prejudice. I don't believe that your genitals soley determine your gender role. But, I also don't believe that a person with a penis is a girl in the strict sense that a prerequisite of being a girl is that you have a vagina. So although that person may not identify with one of the male gender roles, I think it's abit of a stretch to start calling them a female. I'm curious as to what exactly I said that you interpreted as me enforcing my opinion. I kind of went out of my way to stress the opposite."
Boise,2xp3ro,encephlavator,2,Tue Mar 3 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"You did say that you didn't like people being argumentative and insistent, but in this context your definition of ""argumentative and insistent"" is taking a picture and posting it online with no editorial content whatsoever. You're putting a restriction on D.L. that you wouldn't put on me and you certainly wouldn't want to have put on you.

Or does ""minority"" refer to the nature of the thread because we're getting into theory of reddit stuff. As others have pointed out, OP should have given a little more context.   Anyway if it's ToR you want to debate, I'm all ears. IMO, it's (the original post) really an opinion piece. That's fine by me but it should have been prefaced with the tag [opinion]. There's as a reason op/eds in the Statesman go on the op/ed page.  Here's the rule on op/eds which has been there for quite a while, over a year at least. I made the mistake of editorializing a headline 3 or 4 years ago and got my arse handed to me. I've been careful not to do it again.  One reason I'm taking more than a passing interest in this is not the first time u/doteman has done this. See this thread.

I'm asserting the submission (underwater girl) by u/doteman  was 1) strangely missing some context and 2) an opinion piece. It should have been tagged with [opinion] and with a clearer headline. That is the point I was trying to make.   Regarding vote brigading, you seem to imply I was talking about myself. I was commenting on the entire thread.

Their parents are choosing to let them die from conditions which we are able to overcome due to advances in medicine. It's not about forcing someone to live how I want them to; it's about allowing children the opportunity to grow up and make their own decisions about their own health. Just like you do everyday.

Welcome to faith healing, having some sick twisted form of 'good intent' but in reality you're just a moron. But according to your logic this is perfectly fine.

Science is pretty cold and hard, but it can be interpreted in a million ways. Science may suggest that we terminate all mentally handicapped, or non-productive people for the good of the species (as was proposed in the early 1900's). We need ethics to guide how we use science, and how we operate our society. If people get ethics from religion, then those ""ancient manuscripts"" and prayers and rites will help improve society.

Scientific journals are packed every month with modifications of previously held ""truths,"" like the recent proposal that the big bang theory is incorrect. Sure, there is a cold, hard truth, but being able to identify it, explain it, and understand it with 100% accuracy is something we haven't achieved yet.   But even if we could, somehow, access and identify all knowledge about our world and universe, and understand exactly how everything works, it still doesn't help us with ethics. People will still interpret the implications of that scientific data in a million ways. If we discover that the earth will warm 5 degrees over the next 100 years, what do we do? Do we allow it to warm, and improve people's life in colder climates? Do we stop it? Do we geo-engineer a solution to cool the earth, or to stop the temperature at present levels? With a limited amount of human resources and capital, is this warming a priority, or is providing clean water a better priority? Or stopping desertification in the Sahara? If our population gets out of control, do we stop having babies? Do we sterilize a certain group of people? How many babies can we have? Do we kill the old people? Do we kill handicapped, or mentally ill people?   Science is a nice set of facts, if we can believe that we have the right facts at least, but it doesn't answer the ethical questions we face. Those might come from natural self preservation, altruism, or some external source of ethics, like religion.   I agree, religion can be used for evil, as well as good. But science itself doesn't answer the questions about how to maintain a society, and people can use science to promote evil just as much as it can promote good. If (and that's a big if) you get positive ethics from philosophy, religion, or some sense of helping the species through scientific study, then why should we condemn that?"

When the cashier asks the customer ahead of you if he/she is playing the game, don't be afraid to pipe up and say ""I am"" if they don't want them. It's an easy way to get extra tickets and the customer and cashier don't mind. I've had customers that earn 100 tickets on one order and they often don't want them, so it can really pay off for other people!   Good luck!"
Boise,2x52qc,Cokeb5,3,Wed Feb 25 20:10:12 2015 UTC,Keep in mind the rules are that the person ahead of you has to hand you their unwanted tickets. The cashier cannot hand them directly to you.
Boise,2x52qc,fireengineer,2,Thu Feb 26 02:27:55 2015 UTC,"Indeed, but when you pipe up the customer will usually say something along the lines of ""Oh, I mean yes, of course I'm playing!"" or the cashiers will mention that they can only hand them out to the person who earned them, and then they'll take them and hand them back. It all works out in the end. :)"

Boise,2wwv5s,DemureDuck,1 point,Tue Feb 24 01:58:57 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of problems that go far beyond the point you're making.  First off, ""voters"" have no choice but to rely upon the media to give them information.  I don't know about you, but I simply don't have the time to spend at the state house all day watching legislative sessions.  I certainly don't have time to commute between here and DC in order to try to keep up with the House and Senate sessions too.  Even trying to listen to audio recordings of every session that takes place along with committee hearings, town hall meetings, and speeches would be an impossible task.  Second, I know first hand (well, second really) what goes on in political sessions.  My grandfather was a representative in the statehouse for quite a few years.  It was mind boggling to hear about committees he'd be appointed to when I knew first hand he had no knowledge of the subject matter at hand.  They'd then base their decisions on the information presented to them, which many times was flat out wrong.  It is entirely plausible that Barberi really did have a lack of Jr. High level anatomy and yet be serving on a committee for women's healthcare.  Finally, this is not information any of us informed voters would use to base a decision upon.  I realize the media doesn't always report things in the right context, and will often be ""fair and balanced"" at the direction of their ownership groups.  Before I vote, I look at their voting history on the topics that are important to me.  I look at their campaign platforms, their backgrounds, and their funding sources when available.  Unfortunately in Idaho there are far too many people that don't put that effort in and will simply vote down a line because of the ""R"" next to it, the ""D"" next to it, or because they saw more TV commercials and roadside signs for a particular candidate."

They are good for other things, but their burgers are shit. I want meat and cheese, not a 1/4 pound of wet iceburg lettuce with an hour old piece of meat somewhere in there.

But I am wondering what tools would you have in said library? I mean, most everyone has the basics such as wrenches, screwdrivers, socket sets, and hammers. If not, you should really spend the money and buy these things for yourself. Same goes for a good, corded drill. Cordless drills are neat but corded  drills have more power for tough jobs. You can get one at a pawn shop for under $20 bucks.   Tools that not everyone might have would be air guns, table saws, jig saws, compressors, etc. These tools are fairly dangerous to people without a working knowledge of them. I have a lot of duplicates that I wouldn't mind donating but there is a liability issue here somewhere."
Boise,2w3p31,TuffAdams,2,Tue Feb 17 14:25:30 2015 UTC,"This came up a couple months ago here and the answer then is the same as now. Home Depot, Tates Rents, Autozone etc. pretty much have it covered. Autozone and O'Reillys even rent tools for free if you buy the relevant parts from them. Also, to me ""library"" implies free. That tool library linked in the previous thread charges a membership fee of $50 annually.   And Rule #1 of Man Code construction/mechanical work of any kind is: Any trip to a store is to be avoided because time = money. That's why Napa, Carquest, Franklin Building Supply, Overland Lumber etc have delivery drivers.  I'm not saying it won't work, but I'm not going the be the first to try to open one.   Someone suggested a tool sharing P2P setup like airbnb does for lodging and spinlister does for bicycles. To me this makes more sense."

If I wanted to work on a project, I'd have to allocate an additional 1.5 hours or more for the round trip, which could be up to half of the time if I only have ""a few hours"" that opened up.  This is the primary reason I've never joined.  If it were located in Meridian, that cuts drive time to around 20 minutes, and is something I'd likely join and use on a regular basis.  Maybe working with OLI to build a partnership or an additional ""branch"" in the west end of the valley may be a more practical approach?  They already cover similar concepts and it may be better to pool resources to expand the audience."

Right now its a challenge to get enough members to justify that, but  tool sharing program has been discussed. Members swap tools and project assistance all the time!"
Boise,2w3p31,badger32d,1 point,Wed Feb 18 06:30:00 2015 UTC,"I used to work with a guy that was a member (possibly founding, I don't know) before he had to move to Seattle.  It is a neat organization and he was always talking about the cool stuff people were doing there.  I just wish it was in a better location."
Boise,2w3p31,JJHall_ID,2,Wed Feb 18 15:37:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear you - sucks for me too! But we get a really good deal for the space, which is important with the desire to keep fees low"
Boise,2w3p31,badger32d,1 point,Wed Feb 18 15:59:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's more likely to function the opposite way, creating one in Boise would probably increase the demand for it in other areas and get everybody up to a more functional state more quickly."
Boise,2w3p31,optimismkills,1 point,Tue Feb 17 03:20:57 2015 UTC,What other cities have successful tool libraries and to what extent if any are they taxpayer subsidized?  The best suggestion I've seen is a P2P site like airbnb or spinlister.
Boise,2w3p31,encephlavator,1 point,Tue Feb 17 14:58:26 2015 UTC,"I like that idea too.  Maybe that would be a good way to get it started, and it could develop into a centralized repository if it grows big enough.  The biggest differences to me seems to be risk management.  With a Peer to Peer setup, if I loan you my tool and you break it (or never return it) I'm out with basically no recourse other than barring you from borrowing tools from any of the P2P members.  This can be mitigated somewhat with deposits, but then you have to trust that I'll be returning the deposit.  Then you have grey areas where say you cause minor damage, such as accidentally cutting the power cord.  This is reparable, but it does lessen the value of the tool.  Do you get some of the deposit back?  None of it?  All of it?  What if the tool just quit working (as sometimes happens) through no fault of your own?  The ""library"" model I would envision working like a membership club.  Everyone pays a membership, say $50 per year.  This membership fee goes to pay for repair or replacements of tools that wear out, get damaged through accidents, etc.  The library owns the tools, acquired though donations, surplus membership fees at the end of the year, etc.  This way the risk of someone stealing or destroying a tool isn't on the shoulders of one individual, but spread and shared among the group. 100 members at $50 per year would bring in $5,000 per year, which could cover a lot of repairs and replacements, and would probably have plenty left over to buy more tools each year.  Where to store the tools could become a factor, but maybe a non-profit could get a decent rate on a warehouse building or even a storage unit.  A 10x14 storage unit with shelves could store a lot of tools.  Maybe a group of us could get together and start the P2P thing?  A simple Google spreadsheet could be a starting point, and the deposit system could be left up to the individuals to work out on a case by case basis.  Heck, a lot of the time I'd be willing to loan/bring my tools and help out with some projects, especially if I can learn how to do something new."
Boise,2w3p31,JJHall_ID,1 point,Tue Feb 17 16:38:18 2015 UTC,What kind of tools? Automotive or household?
Boise,2w3p31,Tommy27,2,Tue Feb 17 00:17:19 2015 UTC,Yes.
Boise,2w3p31,Hobbitron,1 point,Tue Feb 17 03:55:16 2015 UTC,"Good to see some comments on this subject. I'd just like to clarify some things. First, all of the problems that some people have mentioned so far have solutions to them that have already been worked out by the 40 plus tool libraries already in existance. Second, the membership fee (amount varies per library) is only for those who don't volunteer but it does include access to the makerspace. Third, yes it is going to be a non-profit (most likely), but it may be a L3C or a B-corp (this depends on initial support from the community). Fourth, I'll be messaging those of you who asked. Fifth, the type of tools in the library depends entirely on two things: the funding we have and the demand for the tool. Sixth, we will without a doubt be partnering with many of the organizations already in existence. If you know one that hasn't been mentioned yet, then post it. And finally, I know in this digital age things go quickly and people demand instant gratification, but I have a very busy life outside of the internet so I may only get the chance to reply to your questions, comments, and concerns after 24 hours."

Boise,2vvtm5,lacerik,2,Sun Feb 15 03:49:02 2015 UTC,"I know this is probably going to sound antagonistic, I don't mean it to, for your firsthand experience you were committing a crime for which you receive some shouting and a scare?  One thing often forgotten is that you also had to be doing something to justify the police showing up at your house. Unless there was an anonymous tip of underage drinking and they decided to investigate it. I imagine there is more to the story than that you and your friends were quietly sharing some adult beverages when suddenly the gestapo attacked.  I am not one to side with the police against reasonable evidence. The images of police macing handcuffed protesters as the sit on the sidewalk from Occupy Wall Street leaps straight to mind. I haven't heard of brutality, questionable seizure of property, unnecessary arrests or anything such as this."
Boise,2vvtm5,tedzeppelin93,3,Sun Feb 15 03:57:40 2015 UTC,"Wait, let me get this right, I was committing a crime (underage drinking is actually a violation, not a crime) and thus the police should have guns drawn before a situation even begins?   I don't really understand.  ""I haven't heard of brutality, questionable seizure of property, unnecessary arrests or anything such as this.""  Killing a high school sophomore for smoking weed isn't brutality? TIL.  It's pertinent to point out that unnecessarily drawing and pointing a firearm is not ""a scare."" It actually is a felony, far more serious than the violation we were committing."

Boise,2vv1sq,encephlavator,2,Tue Feb 17 08:08:55 2015 UTC,"If your dad owns the place then, um, wth? He can't pressure the landlord? However, if there's a year long lease then there has to be proof they've breached the lease to proceed with an early eviction and even then it's not a slam dunk. I'm guessing there's a 1 year lease so you might have to tough it out for 3 more months but in the meantime make sure you have enough evidence to convince the landlord to not renew. Get a copy of the rental agreement and point out clauses which you think are being violated.   Write letters to the landlord. Call the landlord, keep complaining. Write down everything and try to record some of the noise."

Boise,2vne6g,rawrrrrachel,2,Thu Feb 12 13:32:16 2015 UTC,I am looking for two thing in Boise.  1) The most delicious bloody mary.  2) The best priced bloody mary.  It's going to be a bloody valentines :) Thanks!
Boise,2vne6g,rragnaar,3,Fri Feb 13 08:37:08 2015 UTC,"I've been on the hunt for the best Bloody Mary for a long time.  The following will look like a paragraph, but it is just me rambling semi-coherently about different bars as I try to remember all of them that I've been to in my hunt for the best Bloody Mary.  10th used to have a good one, but they've gotten more inconsistent.  They are $5, and there is free popcorn, so that's not bad.  The Neurolux has a very good one, and the price is right.  At least it was the last time I got one.  $4 for a pint glass sized Bloody Mary is pretty legit.  Red Feather probably has the best, but they are in the $7-8 range.  Tom Grainey's has a great Bloody Mary, but they'll shoot you the stink eye if you order it on a busy night.  The Navajo has a great Bloody Mary, and you can watch people sing karaoke and fight in the parking lot.  Bardenay makes a good one, but it is in a smaller tumbler glass and costs too much.  My honest suggestion if you want the best and cheapest is to go to Fred Meyers and buy the Master of Mixes 5 Pepper Bloody Mary Mix for $6, and then head to the liquor store and get the Crater Lake Pepper Vodka.  I'm finding that that combo beats any of the bars in town right now, and I've been looking for a great one for years.  Edit: Meant to say Master of Mixes 5 Pepper Mix. I haven't tried the Loaded one."

Examples: huge deep fried prawns, crab salad, shrimp cocktail, 1/2 lb burgers and breakfast on the weekends. I believe but can't prove it that they use mostly top shelf ingredients so it's probably not the cheapest in town but it's not overpriced either.   I think there is or was a crossover of employees between the old Stagecoach in Garden City and Gil's. And the Stagecoach was renown for pretty decent food."

Boise,2vd05s,jaxxex,2,Tue Feb 10 20:24:04 2015 UTC,"Of course, nobody knows what commercial rates will be in the future.   But I think all these figures, while appreciated, miss the point: What is it like to use?   I lived in an off-grid community for many years that averaged over 100 inches of rain per year, and had less solar potential than Seattle. My neighbors with panels (several households) all said that their PV systems exceeded their expectations in terms of overall satisfaction.   However, I don't think it's reasonable for a PV system to allow you to have the same consumption patterns as ""normal"" electricity. And we have it pretty good here as far as our electricity being clean and cheap.   In my previous community, electricity was expensive. It had never been available in the area, so people were not looking at an alternative to the grid, but just something to give them electricity. IOW, they had been used to conserving, and a little more power yielded a big difference to them.   Forget running an electric stove, air conditioner, etc... big consumers of power... unless you're willing to spend tens of thousands.   But for lights and electronics, and an emergency backup to keep food cold when the ""regular"" power goes down, unsurpassed, and needs (say) less than 2K investment. The point is, PV scales well to the how you plan to use it.   I don't think it's the best idea to look at PV as an identical alternative to the dam. You really ought to start by thinking of the needs of the appliances you plan to use."
Boise,2vd05s,Nichijo,2,Wed Feb 11 13:52:28 2015 UTC,"Gas or diesel generators are noisy and smoky. But lots of people who have PV still keep one around for occasional heavy loads, e.g. power tools. But if you have a good battery bank, you could still use PV to keep food cold, and for some power.    Remember, a 2k investment will not include power (so your lights are mostly useless in the night time.. same for your fridge)   I don't understand that statement. I knew people who had lights and electronics in their systems that cost less than that.   Point is taken on the grid tie-in. My former community didn't have a grid, so there really weren't any situations where it was necessary to detect the grid going down. Power was always on for them.    If you are doing manual switch over then the 2k investment is doing nothing for you when the power is not out.   I was thinking more along the line of using PV to power some devices all the time, regardless of the grid state. Fridge, lights. One good thing about PV is that it is scaleable and can be implemented on a very small scale. Like a cheap small panel to power an attic fan. Or those solar garden lights you can get at a dollar store. You can modify them to charge batteries.   What I like about it most is that it's ""just there"". You make one initial investment, and you're done. Except you better check your batteries regularly. That was the only problem I heard of people having. They would forget to check their batteries.   I just think that all this free electricity that lands on our homes every day is worth harvesting. Decentralization is also a general principle that makes sense to me... in a lot of areas, not just energy generation."

Yes, the structure of the American education system is shit. IHMO the gifts of youths' are not their abilities to solve great injustices or environmental issues but the fact that their moral character is less corrupt, and disregarded. Corruption, or for that matter cynicism, plays a cruical part in civilization. People who state an argument on morality alone with the intent of social inquiry, will be crushed by their more pragmatic and numerous enemies who have a vested interested in the status-quo. Possibly, a fact or fiction that a any person might not acknowledge. I commend Kate for her effort and the sincerity of her argument.

Boise,2uwlag,Marinejedi356,2,Fri Feb 6 01:07:03 2015 UTC,I've heard a lot of gun owners cite these permits and background checks when defending responsible gun ownership. I figured having them was in their best interest.
Boise,2uwlag,eggery,6,Mon Feb 9 06:20:48 2015 UTC,"Denying gay folks equal rights, denying a little girl the opportunity to designate a state reptile, allowing for more guns everywhere without permits.. You can't make this shit up. COME ON, Idaho!!"
Boise,2uwlag,scienceismyjam,17,Thu Feb 5 22:03:41 2015 UTC,I agree that gay rights are important and Idaho is in the dark ages on the subject but isn't Idaho an open carry state? So what does it matter if its a concealed weapon? That way no one freaks out when they see someone with a pistol on their hip. On a side note I enjoyed hiking through the Sawtooth Mountains with my Mossberg strapped to my U.S. Marine back pack. Absolutely beautiful area!
Boise,2uwlag,Wadsworth34,6,Thu Feb 5 23:30:43 2015 UTC,"I've got no problem with folks owning guns, but why is it so necessary that we take away permitting and required classes? I'm sure that you got excellent weapon training as a Marine. So, why can't we ask civilians to comply with at least basic training before they get their concealed permit? Would you want novice, untrained gun-owners entering public spaces with concealed weapons? It just seems ripe for more tragic, preventable accidents. We aren't trampling anyone's rights to carry by requiring them to take the time to learn how to responsibly handle a deadly weapon - concealed in public, no less."
Boise,2uwlag,scienceismyjam,8,Fri Feb 6 16:58:11 2015 UTC,"The CCW class isn't as stringent as you think. I would love to see that get much more robust on top of having to have the background check, but it seems like Idaho is going the other way. I learned way more about how to handle firearms responsibly when I was a kid wanting to get my deer license than as an adult. The CCW class I took was 4 hours of a powerpoint presentation. No handling of firearms by the class to prove they can do it safely, just a quick demo by the trainer and then lots of talking about how to keep a house safe. Bam, certificate, please take this to the courthouse to get your background check. There were people in this class that I would legit run away from if I knew they were armed, people who have no business wielding anything more powerful than a taser."
Boise,2uwlag,reflectivity,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:29:31 2015 UTC,"Indiana has no training needed, currently. Go through a background check and finger prints and thats it. Whole permit is 125.00 for life."
Boise,2uwlag,Wadsworth34,-1,Fri Feb 6 19:59:09 2015 UTC,Because fundamental rights should not require permitting ever.  Should we start requiring permits to be able to say anything in public? History has shown that people have been able to do more damage with words than with guns.

Boise,2uwlag,ReverandDave,3,Fri Feb 6 15:36:26 2015 UTC,Perfect. My permit expires in 6 months. Let's hurry up and pass this so I can save 25 bucks on the renewal.
Boise,2uwlag,Spanish_Echo,4,Thu Feb 5 21:12:24 2015 UTC,"25 bucks? You all are spoiled. To get a permit here in Ilinois and including a pistol and accessories it would cost you over a grand. Depending on the pistol choice, just a Glock would probably be over a grand with training costs and fees."
Boise,2uwlag,Wadsworth34,7,Thu Feb 5 23:33:16 2015 UTC,"Hahah, what? What does the cost of a gun have to do with a permit renewal fee?"
Boise,2uwlag,Spanish_Echo,3,Thu Feb 5 23:41:50 2015 UTC,Whoops. Sorry..read your comment too fast. Our renewal fee is 150.00 at this time. Renewal every 5 years.

Boise,2uwlag,yellowsubmarinr,15,Thu Feb 5 21:30:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think this bill mandates or requires citizens to carry, nor those who do carry to do so at all times. It just gives them the ability.  As a concealed carry permit holder, I rarely carry, because most times I feel safe (this would freak out the extreme gun nuts). Idaho is awesome, and mostly safe. However, there are places which aren't safe, and I'd like to lawfully be able to protect myself in those areas. Fuck me, right?"
Boise,2uwlag,deedubaya,7,Fri Feb 6 00:36:26 2015 UTC,"Idaho is awesome, and mostly safe. However, there are places which aren't safe   I appreciate you trying to be discreet, but you can say ""Canyon County"" here."
Boise,2uwlag,Spanish_Echo,-4,Fri Feb 6 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you read my full post, but what I'm saying is taking away the process for LEGALLY carrying a concealed weapon shouldn't go away. Why do you gun nuts freak out when there's any sort of paperwork between you and ""yer guns""? Seriously? If you're an upstanding citizen, then you should have no problem applying for a concealed weapons permit."
Boise,2uwlag,yellowsubmarinr,2,Fri Feb 6 14:52:54 2015 UTC,"And there you go taking away any valid points you could have made by calling me a nut, freak, and implying I'm uneducated.  Ignoring that   Why do you gun nuts freak out when there's any sort of paperwork between you and ""yer guns""? Seriously?   I was replying to your previous question of   Why does everyone need to have a gun with them at all times.   Upstanding citizens should have no problem applying for a concealed weapons permit, agreed. I do wonder, however, if the citizen who has malicious intent - who isn't upstanding - would bother applying for a concealed weapons permit?   What if a citizen were previously a good person and obtained a permit, but decided to do a bad thing?  My point being, the requirement of a permit prevents nothing malicious from happening. It only hinders law abiding citizens, cost them money, and wastes the time of law enforcement agencies which are tasked with investigating and approving these permits.  It is similar to the idea of requiring a doctors note to smoke medicinal marijuana."
Boise,2uwlag,deedubaya,0,Fri Feb 6 17:56:02 2015 UTC,"You're right, I was a bit irritated by some other replies here and took it out in my reply to you. Sorry about that.  It does seem, though, that people here in Idaho get quite up in arms (no pun intended..) about pretty much any law pertaining to guns. Will you stop all malicious gun owners by having concealed weapons permits? Of course not. However, as you said, malicious gun owners are less likely to apply for, and be granted, a permit. Which then makes them carrying concealed weapons illegal. That's a good thing, right?   Not only that, I would argue that it does prevent some people from leaving their homes with guns. The bad guys? Nah, you're right, they will still carry. But a lot of the people who end up killing someone with a gun aren't the people you expect. They aren't the folks with prior felonies, they're regular folks like you and I, things got heated, maybe an argument at a bar.. and someone gets shot and killed. If that guy didn't have a gun, no lives are lost, no one is going to prison..   This is what I'm talking about. This is why I think more guns on the streets = more idiots with guns. And having a concealed carry permit is going to mean less guns on the streets (it can be argued that it's not very effective, but I think we all can agree less guns overall). Is it annoying to have to apply for, and pay for, a permit? Definitely. Is it a waste of time? If it even prevents one idiot with a gun using it when he/she shouldn't, then yeah, it's worth it."
Boise,2uwlag,yellowsubmarinr,4,Fri Feb 6 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"First of all, calling someone with a differing opinion a ""nut"" and a ""freak"" and implying they are uneducated by using ""yer"" is insulting and beneath response.  An apology is warranted.  Second, if someone can legally possess a weapon, why should they be punished if their jacket covers it?  Why should they be punished if they forget to renew their license?  There are already a ton of gun laws.  Adding licensing requirements for HOW they choose to carry doesn't affect WHO gets to carry."
Boise,2uwlag,Boise_Science_Guy,7,Fri Feb 6 16:40:49 2015 UTC,Because bad people exist.
Boise,2uwlag,etherreal,3,Thu Feb 5 21:31:00 2015 UTC,"Seems like there's a higher chance of hurting yourself/family/others by, you know, carrying a concealed gun on you, than the chance of running into a bad guy, and having the opportunity to use your weapon.. I mean wasn't the mom that was killed BY HER INFANT SON in Coeur d'Alene warning enough?"
Boise,2uwlag,yellowsubmarinr,8,Thu Feb 5 21:34:06 2015 UTC,Negligence by some should not translate to legislation for all.
Boise,2uwlag,etherreal,4,Thu Feb 5 21:42:53 2015 UTC,"The sad part about that is that she was ""trained"" and had a permit to carry concealed. If she could meet all the tests currently required and still get shot by a very small child imagine the untrained.  Yes, bad people happen. But if you don't know enough to secure your firearm from your child to avoid being shot you don't deserve the right to carry it.  It wasn't the child's fault. It was hers."
Boise,2uwlag,Tebori44,6,Fri Feb 6 13:31:55 2015 UTC,"The point is, it's not my fault so don't legislate like it is."
Boise,2uwlag,etherreal,1 point,Fri Feb 6 13:45:44 2015 UTC,"And I agree. Had the person who was not culpable because they were unable to know right from wrong shot you I'd also feel bad.  You can't (although it is tried frequently) legislate morality, responsibility or any number of things.  Alcohol, cigarettes and driving are all legal and potentially fatal to someone if you don't handle them with care. Prohibition didn't work and it isn't like people won't carry concealed illegally if this doesn't pass.  Vitriol is all well and good but if you aren't responsible enough to handle something there should be some mechanism (education maybe?) to address the issue. It doesn't have to be a law, but people who don't want anything that they may be interested in legislated against often seem to want to legislate against stuff they don't like. Just my opinion..."
Boise,2uwlag,Tebori44,2,Sat Feb 7 00:06:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I lean strongly libertarian so the whole ""legislate against what I don't like"" philosophy doesn't really resonate with me."
Boise,2uwlag,etherreal,1 point,Sat Feb 7 02:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true, but I don't see why we would want to eliminate the process of acquiring a concealed carry permit. If you want to carry, then great - apply for a permit. Otherwise, you're a criminal. Personally, I would prefer that fresh 18 year olds aren't carrying guns legally wherever they want, that they understand through the process of getting the permit, that carrying a gun is a big deal. I think getting rid of concealed carry permit makes guns even more casual than they already are... not a good thing"
Boise,2uwlag,yellowsubmarinr,3,Thu Feb 5 21:58:12 2015 UTC,You don't need a license to carry a gun. You need a license to conceal one.

Owning and constantly carrying a handgun for protection does not increase lifespan statistically, although in some circumstances it might be appropriate (almost universally not in day to day life in Idaho).

Mother Jones is a liberal magazine but so what, they practice respectable fact based journalism.  I included that link because it is a good straight forward article.  Fact: Owning a gun significantly increases your chances of death or injury from a firearm.  This statistically outweighs the advantage of a gun as protection from ""bad people.""

There are times when carrying a gun can increase security; going to Albertsons isn't one of them.  Day to day owning a firearm is more unsafe than not owning one, that is a statistical fact.  Now maybe you are 100% responsible and trained etc., great.  I just don't like the narrative that the world is (especially Idaho) a big scary place and you NEED a gun to protect you from it.  Your personal world is actually scarier when you own a gun because the probability of being shot is higher when you own a gun, not lower.  You aren't actually protecting yourself.    I could search and post more links but what I posted is fine.  Both of those links are to well respected institutions.  Mother Jones is liberal but they aren't a rag.

No offense by why are ad hominem arguments even up voted, they provide nothing of value. You aren't adding to any debate, just shooting the messenger.   If you could reason with unreasonable people then, well, they wouldn't be unreasonable.   You're dealing with not just a debate but something much deeper. You're dealing with hardwired brains, it is programmed into their brains and it's probably genetic. You might as well tell the gun advocates to change their eye color or the length of their foot.   It's clear the 2nd Amendment begins with that pesky militia clause and they refuse to even parse that. A loner with a gun is not a militia. And don't get me started on cars needing insurance policies and licensing etc, but somehow guns escape that kind of scrutiny."

If you want to carry, then great - apply for a permit. Otherwise, you're a criminal. Personally, I would prefer that fresh 18 year olds aren't carrying guns legally wherever they want, that they understand through the process of getting the permit, that carrying a gun is a big deal. I think getting rid of concealed carry permit makes guns even more casual than they already are... not a good thing   Like this post?

Seems like there's a higher chance of hurting yourself/family/others by, you know, carrying a concealed gun on you, than the chance of running into a bad guy, and having the opportunity to use your weapon.. I mean wasn't the mom that was killed BY HER INFANT SON in Coeur d'Alene warning enough?    And I guess this post of mine was bad because it's a 'fallacy' right?

There was an awesome scene for house shows and bands in general (which seems like it has kinda died down now) but it was a great way to meet people and be exposed to new things. There are some all-ages venues in Boise and Nampa that you could check out and 'like' on FB. Potentially crappy advice (sorry): try and open yourself up to lots of new things, don't limit yourself to computers and indie music- that sounds boring as hell. Don't bag on hiking either, I fucking love hiking. Anyway..I second the whole treefort shindig. Hell, I'll probably be there. And I'll even hang out with you. And, yeah, it was probably easier to make friends in pdx in 2006 BECAUSE YOU WERE ELEVEN. these things get harder with age, bro."

Boise,2u7mpu,amyzillamon,19,Fri Jan 30 16:46:25 2015 UTC,"If only someone had run for state superintendent last year who had had some kind of experience with this, maybe someone who had been the DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF INSTRUCTION FOR TWO TERMS.  Oh, wait. That was Jana Jones.  She had a D by her name, so she was unelectable in Idaho."
Boise,2u7mpu,gemstate08,7,Sat Jan 31 01:55:01 2015 UTC,"I am not sure how or why she was voted into office besides the fact that she had an R next to her name.  Besides this funny yet sad story, Here's why she probably shouldn't have been voted in:  She lied about her education - said she had a masters degree when she doesn't yet  She was accused of hiding her marital status, which isn't a big deal to me, but whatever  She plagiarized information from her opponents website by taking the Jones' text and and re-writing it. You can see some of it on the issues page between the two here (Ybarra) and here (Jones)  There were other issues in articles surrounding her that can be read on the various news articles out there.  All that said, I am not too surprised that she got voted in because she was the Republican choice in a state where republican is the choice of seemingly 90% of the population no matter the stance on the issues. It just saddens me a little and makes me jaded towards politics here.  (source 1)  (source 2)"
Boise,2u7mpu,lastrogu3,7,Fri Jan 30 23:51:29 2015 UTC,"I don't even care about most of that stuff (although the plagiarism was pretty stupid).  The thing that should have completely, automatically, 100% disqualified her is the fact that she hasn't didn't bother to vote in Idaho between 1996 and the year she was actually on the ballot.  That means she didn't have a strong enough opinion about the Luna laws to get up 15 minutes early just one day in a year! That means she has never given up a lunch break or a post-workday latte to vote for a single supplemental school levy (without which our broke-ass education system would be even more un-hilariously bad). That means she does not give one single fuck about schools or the educational system in Idaho.  Paying Ybarra is basically the same as cutting a much larger than average welfare check except welfare recipients are often (coincidentally also since 1996) required to show they did some work in order to get paid."
Boise,2u7mpu,bgross,11,Sat Jan 31 00:50:52 2015 UTC,"Not defending Ybarra, but the article doesn't say the budget will need a re-write."
Boise,2u7mpu,mbleslie,4,Fri Jan 30 16:56:04 2015 UTC,"You're right, but this one does straight from the JFAC co-chair: http://www.idahoednews.org/the-edge-blog/analysis-ybarras-budget-will-get-a-rewrite/#.VMqVXVw_3-Y  I just thought the first story covered the whole issue better."
Boise,2u7mpu,Xgamer4,5,Fri Jan 30 17:06:07 2015 UTC,"That article does make a good point in that she's only been on a job month or so, and presenting a budget that isn't entirely her's.   I'm going to be optimistic and hope things improve. If solely because I have no other option."
Boise,2u7mpu,martel25,3,Fri Jan 30 17:27:43 2015 UTC,That's a great way to think about it.   On the pessimistic side she should have had it done before the election but since voters don't actually look at who is running she skated through anyway.
Boise,2u7mpu,Xgamer4,2,Fri Jan 30 18:00:25 2015 UTC,"What I read was merely an excuse for her poor performance. These new legislators will be putting together a full budget, based on a previous budget that they might not have created in just about a months time.   She has a whole team whose responsibility is to help work her through this. In addition to that, she spent the two months between election and her inauguration working directly with Luna, his experts and her staff, presumably on this budget.   This is part of her job, and every new Sup. of Public Instruction has been met with this same 1 month crunch, yet she is the first one to come across without details on-hand.  If you read more about her budget, it appears to be exactly Luna's budget with minor tweeks, some of which she didn't even bother to actually make in the budget but instead just mention in her short speech.   It is based on his enrollment guesses from 6+ months ago which are now way out of date. That seems like a pretty easy fix to me that she never bothered to do. That easy fix has instead made it nearly impossible to compare her budget with the Governor's budget, since he built his on the most recent enrollment forecast.   I guess you're right about having no other option than optimism though. I'm hoping she starts relying more on those around her who actually know what they are doing. I just want more people to really know what's happening at the highest level here, maybe then she wouldn't have been elected in the first place."
Boise,2u7mpu,bcool111,4,Fri Jan 30 21:16:05 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong. I voted against her, and find it absolutely appalling she was elected. I'm not even remotely surprised that she's failing miserably.   I just want to be optimistic."

Boise,2u7mpu,bcool111,14,Fri Jan 30 21:28:44 2015 UTC,"I've lived here 20 years now and have been forced to draw the same conclusion as bcool111. Idaho's politics are controlled by one chronically reelected group. The people of this group are the owners of our houses, our range land, the companies we work for among other things. I love Idaho but the 19th century mentality that manages our businesses, administrates our education system, and governs our public resources could be improved. (There are service workers in this state earning less than 4 dollars an hour.) Somehow the republican party of this state has branded themselves libertarian collecting vote after vote from our church going, Fox News conspiring majority.  With this lopsided popularity, and running unopposed in so many elections statewide, our powers that be have had no need to represent our popular opinion.  I assert that there is nobody running this state. They are at their cabins drinking a Keystone."
Boise,2u7mpu,ipronoun,4,Fri Jan 30 22:08:54 2015 UTC,We're just going to have to wait for this batch of assholes to die out and hold onto the hope that the next group is a little easier to work with.

Seems to me the republican national party has more control here than the local administration. Farm subsidies, federal grazing, and mining claims, push more cash into politics here than any industry our 1.6 million population can come up with.  But, unless the local cops have a hard on for you, it is surprisingly easy to live here, and it keeps getting better to live here all of time."

Boise,2u7mpu,ipronoun,2,Fri Jan 30 22:38:35 2015 UTC,"Try living in areas that are dominated by the left. The same thing happens. Lack of competition leads to candidates of less than stellar quality.  I just think it's hyperbole to say no one knows what they're doing. They do, and largely they're doing what their constituents want.  Idaho has never been the most educated or wealthy state. People on r/boise think that the government can fix all of that. It can't. Idaho is the way it is because that's who lives here. Blaming it all on the government is naive."
Boise,2u7mpu,FedoraSal,3,Fri Jan 30 22:55:54 2015 UTC,"The latest slew of Idaho politicians has the same liberal agenda as any county government in California had, when I was growing up.   We have good right to blame them. We are them. They really are the only people worth blaming. We elected a handful of us to be blamed. Society has issues, these issues need attention. If we blame each other individually we accomplish little. If we blame each other generally, perhaps we can have a conversation and not take things personally.  Idaho is a wealthy state. We have a history of invention, incredible engineering firms, and a few agricultural and lumber empires. We have more natural resources here than most of Europe.  The government is happy to have policy concerning all of these important things.  Ask someone why I can take my ex wife's EITC by claiming my child support, 2500 dollars or so, when I'm only required to pay 87$ a month in child support.  All you'll get is blank stares.  The government must fix all of that. They must try an make my electrical license valid in the surrounding states when our economy cant feed me. It's their license, shouldn't their license be well regarded by other states? They should consider charging more from mining companies if they are going to use our water. The government validates the claim rights, and a vast majority of these claims go to no bid contracts. It would be good for the government to fix this.  I'm sure they know what their doing when they sign onto some lobbyist's agenda, or when they tow the line with famous republicans. There is a top down mentality for leadership here in Idaho. What they say goes. Our state government does not understand the concept of participatory democracy and prefers to run the state like a corporation.   The idea that we lost the election and so our team doesn't get any representation is the rule here. The electoral college system has prevented me from casting a vote for president since I moved here in 96.   They really really don't know what they are doing."

Boise,2u5pbr,jaxxex,7,Fri Jan 30 13:43:12 2015 UTC,Define great.... My opinion on this and yours may be very different.
Boise,2u5pbr,13lah,0,Fri Jan 30 04:40:46 2015 UTC,"""Family oriented"" usually means a newish subdivision like Columbia Village."
Boise,2u5pbr,darkstar999,2,Fri Jan 30 06:55:28 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I personally don't consider that neighborhood family oriented by any stretch. The north end is much more family friendly in my opinion based on the friendliness/cohesiveness of the community. If that's what he's looking for I don't think he would find that on the east side of town. So again it comes down to personal preference which he did not specify."
Boise,2u5pbr,13lah,5,Fri Jan 30 14:54:08 2015 UTC,"Really? Columbia Village is subdivision with private parks, swimming pool, soccer fields and all that. Seems geared towards kids a lot more than the NE. Not my cup of tea, but it seems like what OP is looking for."
Boise,2u5pbr,darkstar999,3,Fri Jan 30 14:58:35 2015 UTC,Suburban wasteland? No I don't think it's a great place for kids. I've got my family in a rural setting where we can walk across the field and purchase farm fresh eggs from my neighbor. I think that kind of environment is far superior for kids in every way. But you won't find that on the east side of town. In fact you really won't find anything but a regurgitation of Columbia villages across the entire east side. How these neighborhoods differ is fairly trivial. Which is why he should specify what he's looking for. Does he want small parks and swimming pools where houses are packed in like sardines or is he looking for a friendlier environment that lacks amenities? Does he want an urban progressive community or does he want something rural and traditional? He doesn't specify.   Edit: down vote away fools. Everyone has different ideas about what their ideal is. If he wants something different than what I think is good for kids it's helpful to specify. If you're butt hurt because I insulted your neighborhood or ideal place to reside then consider that one more good reason for why I wouldn't like living near you. Believe it or not some people have different opinions.

Boise,2u5pbr,darkstar999,2,Sat Jan 31 20:44:54 2015 UTC,"Fair point, and I'm also personally more inclined to not live in suburban wasteland, but usually when people say they are looking for ""kid friendly"", they want a place where there are many families, parks, and maybe private access to pools/etc. (I'm not downvoting you, someone else is)"

There still is. It's an isolated place and kids/teens would resort to kinda unhealthy activities to relieve their boredom Yeah there's soccer and stuff but not everyone is that into soccer. North end/warm springs/foothills are really lovely but also very expensive. The area around Bergeson and Holcomb is nice.. lived there for a while too and it was much better than Columbia Village or the surrounding subdivisions. Boise Ave or Manitou are also nice neighborhoods. The area around Garfield elementary and Broadway seems pretty cool too. Good luck!"

Presidential midterms was the worst time this bill could have finally been allowed to be presented to the committee, we had under 40% voter turnout and a vast conservative majority in both the house and the senate. The bill was dead on arrival as a result, and it's probably better this way instead of drawing out until it was put to a vote in March to be shot down then.  I've emailed the Add The Words folks and asked them to seek getting a ballot initiative for 2016, so that this can finally be solved by popular vote instead of relying on our broken legislative body to get their act together. I'd happily go collect signatures to get this put on the ballot, and I'm sure there's many others out there who would as well."

Boise,2u3gpk,willsueforfood,2,Fri Jan 30 04:13:50 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for /u/fly_caster, but Idaho is one of the free-est states in the union.    Having lived in a number of other states with frustrating over-regulation, Idaho is a breath of fresh air."
Boise,2u3gpk,obstacle2,0,Fri Jan 30 07:11:57 2015 UTC,"Is it a gun thing? Honestly that is all that really stands out to me.  I mean maybe as a business owner there are advantages that I am not totally aware of but the lack of regulation here does have some downsides.  Child care for example here in Idaho is a travesty because there are basically no regulations on the people providing it.   Is this freedom worth the lack of education funding? The cost of living here isn't even low when taking into consideration the low wages.  Of all the states I've lived in Idaho is the worst. Alaska and Nevada manage to maintain their ""free-ness"" without having to shit on other people."
Boise,2u3gpk,willsueforfood,1 point,Fri Jan 30 09:30:53 2015 UTC,"Idaho does have an excellent lack of gun laws, but that's not it.  I've helped people start businesses in three different states, and the regulatory burden on business is far less in Idaho.  Also, there is a bunch of little things.  In surrounding states, your windshield can't be cracked.  You have to wear a helmet on a motorcycle.  You can't travel in the left lane unless you are actively passing someone.  You can't talk on your cell phone unless it's hands free.  The list could go on for pages."
Boise,2u3gpk,obstacle2,1 point,Fri Jan 30 18:41:15 2015 UTC,"While the ability to start businesses without a lot of regulatory nonsense is a positive, I am really finding it hard to understand the rest of what you mentioned.   I mean, lets be honest, there isnt a ton of enforcement of those things in those states. Regardless though, driving isn't a right and people ought to drive safely considering the risk unsafe drivers oppose to other people. Cruising in the left lane, having a cracked windshield, talking on a cellphone, these are asshole things to do and put other people at risk.  If those are at the TOP of your list of reasons why Idaho is a nice place to live, that is unfortunate.  But I'm perfectly fine leaving instead of trying to change it. It's obvious the people who live here want it that way. Others should do the same."
Boise,2u3gpk,willsueforfood,0,Fri Jan 30 19:12:21 2015 UTC,"No, driving unsafely is an asshole thing to do that puts other people at risk.  We already have laws against reckless driving, and that should be sufficient.  There is no need to punish everyone who uses a cell phone or has a cracked windshield so long as they aren't putting other people at risk.    Seatbelt tickets are also only $10 here.  It's none of the government's business whether I wear a seatbelt.   There is a slough of regulatory nonsense in other places.  Idaho has some nonsense, but not nearly as much as other places.    And we aren't TALKING ABOUT THE TOP OF MY LIST OF REASONS WHY IDAHO IS A NICE PLACE.  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHY I MIGHT BE PROUD OF THE LEGISLATURE. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST."

Regardless, considering marriage and housing and (in theory) employment, those 4 words would sure mean a lot to a ton of people."
Boise,2u3gpk,snuxoll,2,Thu Jan 29 18:17:19 2015 UTC,"I think that the government shouldn't be able to discriminate against people (in housing or jobs or whatever) based on stupid reasons (""I don't like you because you are gay"" is pretty fucking stupid)  But I think in the private sector (be it housing or employment or whatever) people need to be free to make stupid decisions. If we are only free to make good choices, what kind of freedom is that?    I would gladly boycott any organization that decided to fire someone because they were gay/trans/whatever, but I don't think that the employee should be able to sue over it.   edit: and I hold that position against my own financial interest.  As an attorney, the more people sue each other, the more work I can get."
Boise,2u3gpk,willsueforfood,3,Thu Jan 29 19:29:05 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately since sexual orientation and gender identity aren't protected statuses not only can you not sue for wrongful termination, you can't collect unemployment because it can be deemed termination for cause.

Boise,2u3gpk,snuxoll,1 point,Thu Jan 29 19:57:03 2015 UTC,"It's not right to fire someone for a stupid reason.  Letting the employee sue just isn't the answer.    It will serve to obfuscate the real cause of the firing - leading to an absence of information for people who want to vote with their wallets.     I want to boycott bigots.  If people hide their bigotry, it's not going to lead to fewer bigoted firings.  It'll lead to fewer honestly bigoted firings."

Also- you seem pretty happy that this bill failed, why is that? What consequences are you worried about if this had passed?"
Boise,2u3gpk,snuxoll,2,Fri Jan 30 04:56:26 2015 UTC,"So for you, the republican party stands for low property taxes, loose gun regulations, and right to work. Just out of curiosity- would you be opposed to higher taxes if you knew they were going toward something like schools?  If HR-2 wouldn't affect you, why are you opposed to it? I feel similarly (that it wouldn't affect my day-to-day life), which seems like an argument in favor. Like, if we can move toward equal treatment of gay/trans/whatever folks, at little or no cost, why shouldn't we do that?    I feel that if somebody has a dislike towards the LGBT community, so be it and they should be able to express themselves.    As far as I can tell, this wouldn't change. Like, an anti-gay landlord couldn't ""express himself"" by refusing to rent to a lesbian couple, but there would be nothing to stop him going on tv to talk about how evil they are. Is that not your understanding? Or do you still think that is unreasonable?"

The idea behind add the words is to make it illegal to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation, the same way we currently do w/ race, religion, age, etc. All of which to say, we are not talking about affirmative action, and so I don't understand how anything in your last comment is germane to this discussion.   If what you meant is that you wish we didn't need those laws either, that seems like kind of a cop-out, don't you think?"

One possible thing would be for a LGBT person or people to take the state to Civil court like the couples did for same sex marriage; it would then go to the Idaho District court and be heard which could override the houses decision, it could then go to the 9th District Court of Appeals if Idaho decides to fight it, or if it fails and prosecution decides to push for an appeal."

Boise,2u3h8a,encephlavator,2,Thu Jan 29 20:10:49 2015 UTC,"If some kind of discrimination suit makes it to a court, likely federal court, and the plaintiff wins, it could force the State's hand.   I'm guessing it's done for this year, but it will come up again next year with better chances. The Mormon church has even tweaked their rhetoric this week. So, I'm going out on a limb as state, rather than these hearings being a farce, it's a means of getting their constituents accustomed to the idea that some version of HB 2 is going to eventually pass. That way they can save face, everyone can go on their way and it will be forgotten by the next election."
Boise,2u3h8a,gumpyland,1 point,Thu Jan 29 18:05:03 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to deal with this would be to force federal law to ""Add the Words"" instead of focusing on the state level. You have a significantly higher chance of winning there."

Often, even simple word definitions are argued and have to be spelled out with multiple paragraphs before the relevant law itself gets passed. It's just the way it is. And that's why we have the 3rd branch of gov't called the judicial system.  It's also why we have a representative democracy instead of direct democracy. Nothing would ever get done if everyone got to drone on for hours often times in completely irrelevant ways or multiple people endlessly parroting the same point. Kind of like reddit.

Bonobo monkeys are a good example of homosexualty as well as broader sexuality in nature.  Second, even if it were a choice, so is religion. Yet one is protected and the other isn't.

Hazarding a guess, the HP office has something to do with one of the below companies, whether or not one of them is related to their fiber project is hard to discern. A search of the Kansas Sec. of State's site turns up a ""Google Fiber, Inc."" filed Aug 01, 2012 and a ""Google Fiber Kansas, LLC."" filed Mar 30, 2011 but without a Mt. View, CA address.   As /u/fauxbodo mentions in another comment, the HP office might be related to fiber tech support. Note the Google Information, Inc. filing date in Idaho is 8-13-2012 and the Kansas filing date for Google Fiber, Inc. is 8-1-2012.  Also interesting to note, the latest filing was just a month ago for a Google North America, Inc.   Anyway, ID business listings for Google:    assumed name date filed notes    Google Sep 11, 2012 Sep 11?

Boise,2tpt6z,HiccupMaster,1 point,Tue Jan 27 23:22:44 2015 UTC,"Galapagos, awesome. He'll probably get some more info for what you're looking for and set you up to receive listings in the those categories. Then you can get an idea of what's here. Anything still on the market when you get here you can go take a look at.   When we bought our house houses were getting multiple offers the same day they were being listed, it was crazy. We ended up buying a short sale that took 5 months to close on."

Second, that entire argument is moot, as I can pretty easily believe a decent chunk of his constitutients agree with ""salamanders are icky, I don't want one as a state amphibian..."".

With that clarified, this young, bright girl went about a well-rounded project that included science, conservation, and politics - and took it to levels not often seen by middle schoolers. So really, the politicians had nothing to lose (or gain!) by going through with her plan. They just denied it for reasons of personal feelings of ""creepy"" and ""slimy"".

The school rating system is so screwed up- most of the time these rankings are based only off of standardized test scores, unless I'm mistaken. And standardized tests can be faulty in so many ways. The Spanish immersion part is cool, and it works- but the 4 star part is a joke. They also blast really intense Beethoven over all the loudspeakers constantly, which would drive me insane, haha.

Boise,2t3qfo,snosquatch,1 point,Thu Jan 22 01:23:26 2015 UTC,"I agree about the rating system. It's such a B.S. compliance exercise. I've looked at the spreadsheets for all Idaho schools and schools get points just for submitting complete data. Some schools are given a 1 just because they don't play the game & submit their information- it doesn't matter how their students are actually performing in any way.   Sadly, it's the only comparable data we have for all schools in Idaho. We need to get better information that doesn't just rely on compliance, or only one test, but who knows when the legislature will ever come around to that thinking without attempts to inappropriately tie it to other factors."

Caldwell is not close to Blaine county. No one in the treasure valley can travel every day out to the school in Blaine county. And sadly that school: Hailey Elementary School, no longer offers dual-language immersion, from what I can see. http://hes.blaineschools.org/pages/Hailey_Elementary_School/About_Us  Thank goodness there is a highly rated (4 out of 5 stars) public dual-language immersion school in the the Treasure Valley.

Boise,2sl1sx,shoeman22,3,Fri Jan 16 09:02:07 2015 UTC,Not everything but here the state is obviously looking for revenue options so its very relevant.   We have an example state in Colorado rolling in cash thx to legalization while we're over here accepting toxic nuclear waste for relative peanuts.
Boise,2sl1sx,tapdancingjudas,2,Fri Jan 16 14:12:04 2015 UTC,"Well in this instance it's somewhat comparable if your talking about money coming in and out of the state. Otter says the deal would bring in 20mil over five years. How much money would the state make over five years if marijuana became legal and taxed? How much will Idaho spend on Policing marijuana in the next few years? All the surrounding states are loosening up a lot and you know that means more drug traffic coming into and through Idaho.   Even if you oppose marijuana legalization morally, you have to consider it financially. I would bet money it's go to become a bigger and bigger financial problem for Idaho over the next few years."
Boise,2sl1sx,morosco,2,Fri Jan 16 14:55:05 2015 UTC,"But one decision has nothing to do with the other decision.  This is part of what is holding back marijuana legalization, the proponents can be obnoxious.  Marijuana is not the center of the universe and all other issues aren't defined by it.   Marijuana would make some money in Idaho.  Colorado just reduced their expectations to $58.7 million/year.   And the majority of that comes from tourists.   Colorado has about 3.25 the population that Idaho does.  So assuming that everything else is equal, and Idaho has similar wealth to Colorado and similar tourism and similar appetite for marijuana (none of which is true), then Idaho would bring in $18 million/year.  Nice, but actually less than the protection for accepting waste.  And as for the waste, NIMBY arguments are never very compelling to me.  Where should the waste go instead?  The ocean?    I'd hope we could put in in the place that it can be contained the best, and that would definitely have to be a rural western state."

Boise,2sfnu2,j_macd,5,Wed Jan 14 20:03:11 2015 UTC,"However, 10 Barrel Idaho holds a license that exempts small brewers — those that produce less than 30,000 barrels annually — from that law and allows them to brew beer and sell it directly to consumers at a brewpub.   Who is protected by this law? Why is it bad for a large brewery to sell their own beer in their own restaurant without going through a distributor?"
Boise,2sfnu2,darkstar999,11,Wed Jan 14 21:20:39 2015 UTC,"It's to prevent large companies with a ton of capital from operating at a loss in order to out-starve the competition, resulting in having the market cornered. 10 Barrel wouldn't do that (presumably), but imagine a company selling $2 craft pints for a year; it'd pull a nontrivial amount of business from any other brewery forcing them to close. If they have to go through a distributor, the distributor is going to sell that beer at market value to bars, grocery stores, and back to the brewery itself."
Boise,2sfnu2,fuckyou_space,4,Wed Jan 14 21:45:06 2015 UTC,"the distributor is going to sell that beer at market value...   I'm not clear on this. What's to stop big brewers from selling their very cheap beer to distributors who then pass the lower costs on to their clients? To wit: Keystone. In other words, why aren't we all drinking Keystone, after all, it's the cheapest beer."
Boise,2sfnu2,encephlavator,4,Wed Jan 14 22:15:40 2015 UTC,"Beers like Keystone are in a completely different market than craft beers. Personally I don't care how cheap they make Key Light, I don't drink shitty beer.  Regardless, if a brewery sells $1 bottles to a distributor and the distributor knows they can price it at $3/bottle there is no benefit to the brewery and the distributor has no reason to sell it for cheaper. They can lower the price if it isn't selling fast enough, but they have multiple accounts; it doesn't benefit them to sell cheap Stone next to Sierra Nevada if they're distributing for both breweries."

Boise,2sfnu2,franran,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:01:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I understand the law. But it doesn't make sense to me in the context of brewpubs. I'm trying to understand who benefits from this law besides the distributor. There is no distribution when you make it and serve it in the same building.
Boise,2sfnu2,darkstar999,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:05:46 2015 UTC,"Brewpubs are a relatively new phenomena. This particular situation did not exist when the law was written.

Boise,2sfnu2,franran,2,Wed Jan 14 22:11:01 2015 UTC,"Right, so what I'm getting at is that it is an outdated law that needs to be changed. It doesn't make sense to support this just because you don't like that InBev bought out 10 Barrel."
Boise,2sfnu2,darkstar999,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:15:28 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing with you there, but the law needs to be rewritten to allow direct distribution to a same owner held pub while protecting the fair playing field for small direct distribution producers. It's not an easy fix."
Boise,2sfnu2,franran,2,Wed Jan 14 22:29:43 2015 UTC,"The law is like that right now. If you produce less than 30,000 barrels of beer annually, you can sell your beer at your brewery or brewpub.   Just for scale, Grand Teton, which is #1 for a production brewery in Idaho, brewed a little over 5,000 barrels in 2013. So the limit at 30,000 is really high. It would be a brewery about 6x as big as Payette is now."
Boise,2sfnu2,wees1750,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:43:28 2015 UTC,Bars benefit from this law too . . . levels the playing field a bit when competing against brew pubs if everyone has to go through a distributor (i.e. preventing vertical integration)
Boise,2sfnu2,hairylunch,4,Thu Jan 15 18:55:29 2015 UTC,"The three-tier system is an old law from the repeal of prohibition to basically control the taxes on alcohol. Many states, including Idaho, have exemptions for smaller brewers to allow self-distribution and selling from a brewpub so they can make a small profit and not get crushed by taxes or by a distributor who might not want to distribute their beer.  Larger breweries are able to pay the extra taxes and distributors, and in theory, the three-tier system preventing them from creating a monopoly of production, distribution, and sales."
Boise,2sfnu2,wees1750,0,Wed Jan 14 21:49:20 2015 UTC,"The law makes sense to me when they are distributing outside of their own business, but how does this make sense when a macro brewer wants to sell their own beer at their own restaurant?   Nobody is stopping Simplot from opening a potato store and selling directly to the customer."
Boise,2sfnu2,darkstar999,2,Wed Jan 14 21:58:09 2015 UTC,"Right, but potatoes aren't ""sinful"" like alcohol. The laws around alcohol distribution are old and out-dated."
Boise,2sfnu2,wees1750,2,Wed Jan 14 22:10:56 2015 UTC,You ask some good questions. I'm thinking there must be some historical context that's not being fully explained.   Wees1750 seems to imply economies of scale protect larger brewers from the forced distribution model.
Boise,2sfnu2,encephlavator,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:11:45 2015 UTC,The law as such isn't written to address that question because Big Daddy Beer producers historically have not owned their own pubs or restaurant. It was written to give the little guy a fighting chance by separating the the parts of the beer delivery system.   EDIT: Only recently with the growth of microbrewery and microbrewery pubs has that market become enticing enough for the big boys to want to buy them up.
Boise,2sfnu2,franran,0,Wed Jan 14 22:06:38 2015 UTC,"It wasn't written to protect anyone, it was written to collect taxes. From wikipedia:  ""After Prohibition, the states began to seek methods to regulate and control the alcohol industry lest it return to the excesses and abuses that led to Prohibition years before. The states were also eager to devise a method to levy and collect taxes on alcohol producers. Both of these concerns led to the states individually creating environments in which single ownership of all three tiers (production, distribution and retail) was entirely or partly prohibited."""

Boise,2sc6i6,Basoran,4,Wed Jan 14 17:53:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry to be ""that guy"", but this is an ""Idaho Last List"" not a ""Boise Last List"".  Boise (more accurately the Treasure Valley) is very different from the rest of the state.  I would be interested to see this redone to show how Boise stacks up, but in its current form this should be changed to illustrate that this is MUCH broader than ""Boise""."
Boise,2sc6i6,Seventh7Sun,3,Thu Jan 15 19:02:16 2015 UTC,"You are right, the title is wrong and the Treasure Valley is much different than the rest of the state. But in this globalized economy, the differences are very slim. Boise suffers from the same problems in the same way."
Boise,2sc6i6,prylex3,2,Thu Jan 15 03:48:12 2015 UTC,"It saddens me to see this list. Like so many young people, my wife and I moved away from the state for greener pastures. Now that we are nearing the end of big city life and ready to start a family, we keep looking at Idaho to see what it offers should we move back. Even after an amazing time spending our youth and mid 20's in all corners of the state, we still have a hard time justifying a move back with so many negative headlines and statistics.   However, /r/boise is a great representation of attitude young people have in the state. It's gone from ""We're the best, look at these lists!"" to ""Our Governor is terrible look, look at these lists!"". While the rest of the state may need to catch up to that, it's great to see people start caring more. Good luck Idaho!"

Had to also buy a router with wifi because the Surfboard Costco carries has just a single Ethernet out port and no wifi built in and I think my other router is two states away… At any rate, some before-and-after tests seems to show a noticeable speed improvement with a wired connection, and I also feel more confident about the security of the hardware. (Wireless connections seemed to actually be slower, though to a degree that I'm not confident in the measurements…)  Not cheap but I think it will be worth it in the long run. Were I not so impulsive, I probably would have got one of the Surfboard models with a built-in router from an online store."

EDIT: Some ProTips for others who might be considering doing this: Hook the Surfboard up directly to your computer first (no wifi or other router in between). When you try to go to a web page, CableOne's system will notice you have a new modem and instead take you to some web pages which walk you through getting it to work with their system - so you don't have to call them up to do it, which is real nice. Have your username and password for your CableOne account ready (the same you use to log in to their web site to pay your bill online, if you pay that way). Once you've completed that process, then you can connect the modem to your router."

Boise,2s5bvn,NSFAnythingAtAll,1 point,Mon Jan 12 20:02:21 2015 UTC,"No, it is because it is offering the same service as a taxi, that is why the city shut them down the way that the law is worded it applies even to slippery companies like Uber. Literally providing rides for profit requires commercial licensing and insurance to cover accidents during commercial activity. This is a good thing, the fees for these licenses help pay for the roads that are being used more heavily than under non-commercial usage, and the way personal insurance is written the likelihood it will cover an incident while the person was acting as an Uber driver is very slim. So there are functionally a lot of uninsured cars on the road, that is bad for everyone."
Boise,2s5bvn,Semper_nemo13,-1,Mon Jan 12 20:12:20 2015 UTC,"Uber doesn't own the cars, therefore it is not a taxi company. A prerequisite of being a taxi company is that the company owns a fleet of vehicles. The vehicles in Uber's case are owned by the independently contracted drivers, not the company. Therefore, any licensing or restrictions placed on Uber cannot be enforced on the drivers. No exchange of money takes place between the rider and the driver. This is why anyone who was cited during the city's sting will be able to fight it and win in court."
Boise,2s5bvn,NSFAnythingAtAll,7,Mon Jan 12 20:21:03 2015 UTC,The boise city code does not distinguish between owned and leased taxis:  http://cityclerk.cityofboise.org/media/223531/0524.pdf
Boise,2s5bvn,morosco,4,Mon Jan 12 23:17:36 2015 UTC,"It doesn't apply only to taxi's but the service itself. All of my points about it being bad for the tax payers and citizens of the city to have the service operating without licensing and insurance still stand.  Also, the defense for Uber is something like: ""We use exploited 1099 workers to do our task, all liability is put onto them, and profit mostly from because of shaky intellectual capital laws."" That is contemptible. That type of economic activity isn't the type we ought be promoting anyway."
Boise,2s5bvn,Semper_nemo13,3,Mon Jan 12 20:30:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks to /u/morosco I now know for sure that Uber is not a taxi business. Section 2, definitions:    Taxicab Business A business that leases, owns, operates, or controls one (1) or more taxicab vehicles.    Uber neither leases, owns, operates nor controls a single taxicab vehicle. I also know that the drivers' vehicles are not taxicab vehicles:    Taxicab or Taxicab Vehicle Any motor vehicle capable of carrying one (1) or more passengers or parcels, that carries passengers between points and over such route as may be directed by a passenger, that is available for hails or through a dispatch service, that does not require prearranged appointments, and that is not operated on a fixed route, or a vehicle that is held out to the public as a taxicab.    Drivers' vehicles are not available for hails, require prearranged appointments, and are not ""held out to the public"" as a cab. Also, I'm not sure what an ""exploited 1099 worker"" is, but if you're referring to immigrants, I can tell you there at least as many locals driving for Uber.  I never disagreed with your stance that they should be licensed, or that the taxes are important to the city. I disagreed with holding them accountable to existing laws that don't apply.   Also, learn what a downvote is supposed to be used for."
Boise,2s5bvn,NSFAnythingAtAll,-1,Tue Jan 13 03:03:16 2015 UTC,"They absolutely control the vehicles.  Drivers have to follow the rules of uber, the company controls all payments, and run the app that arrange the rides.   They can remove any car they want from the service at any time.    The app is also clearly a ""dispatch service.""   And they don't require prearranged appointments any more than a regular cab does.  When I call a cap to pick me up, is that a ""prearranged appointment""?  Why is it so different if I use an app to make that call?    I'd also say they're held out to the public as a cab company - they don't use the word, but they're offering to pick me up in a car when I'm out on the town.     They could waste money and fight these things, they do operate differently than traditional cabs in some ways, but obviously they don't share your confidence, otherwise, they would.  And of course, the city could just modify the definition to make it clearer and more specifically include uber if they wanted."

Boise,2s3o0e,janicuda,18,Sun Jan 11 22:25:48 2015 UTC,They already have people living at ground level under the connector by the skate park.
Boise,2s3o0e,Traban,8,Mon Jan 12 01:01:26 2015 UTC,"I'm all for more downtown residential zones, but putting them at ground level seems like a pretty bad idea to me. There's plenty of underutilized space above ground level retail spaces downtown that could be converted to residential space much more easily (and likely more cheaply too) and would provide the same active 24-hour presence as ground-level residential space (provided it is affordable and not just more overpriced condos)."
Boise,2s3o0e,lordairivis,7,Sun Jan 11 23:12:14 2015 UTC,"Im trying to think of cities with ""ground level"" residential space in the downtown areas. I can't. I think the city is realllllly trying hard to make Boise grow up, but I don't think you can force it. I would hate to live at ground level downtown (or where there is a lot of foot traffic right outside my house)."
Boise,2s3o0e,lordairivis,7,Sun Jan 11 23:59:25 2015 UTC,"Well, NYC and much of New England has brownstone walkups, although I don't know if those would be considered ""ground-level"" in the same way that something in the heart of downtown Boise would be considered ""ground-level.""  My feeling is that we should leave the retail space available at ground level and develop more mixed residential/retail spaces near the center of downtown using that vertical space that the city seems to be so keen on wasting, and let the demand caused by a more 24-hour presence downtown fill in the ground level retail spaces with convenience stores and restaurants."
Boise,2s3o0e,lordairivis,5,Mon Jan 12 00:07:02 2015 UTC,"Walk ups in Boston and in nyc are in more ""residential"" areas of  the city in general. I don't know where they'd be able to put a row house/brown stone type building scheme downtown."
Boise,2s3o0e,HiccupMaster,3,Mon Jan 12 00:37:13 2015 UTC,It seems like the only way this plan would work is if they tore down existing structures and put up new buildings in their place and that seems like such a waste.

Boise,2s3o0e,dregan,4,Sun Jan 11 22:26:33 2015 UTC,I love mixing residential and commercial spaces.  But why ground level?  Why not 4 or 5 floor buildings with restaurants and mini marts on the ground and apartments above?
Boise,2s3o0e,Splooshmaker,3,Mon Jan 12 02:39:53 2015 UTC,I honestly can't fathom why not this. Ground level residencies downtown seem like such a terrible idea that it's hard to see how it got to the point of making news.
Boise,2s3o0e,dregan,3,Mon Jan 12 03:34:58 2015 UTC,Who the hell is going to afford these residences?  I know it's not expensive now except for the big condos but this is unrealistic.
Boise,2s3o0e,Splooshmaker,5,Mon Jan 12 00:51:05 2015 UTC,They won't be able to give these away. Have you seen what ground level downtown Boise is like on a weekend?
Boise,2s3o0e,dregan,2,Mon Jan 12 04:09:24 2015 UTC,"They have them on six street in Austin.  They are rediculously expensive.  Six street is way worse than Boise on a weekend.  People will buy them, they will just be too much for the average Joe."

He was trying to drive me through the sales cycle, which really turned me off from the beginning.  This definitely could have impacted my perception of the place.  Maybe I'll go back and give it another shot tomorrow.  Thanks for the feedback!"
Boise,2s0aiz,Eeasom,3,Sun Jan 11 00:44:14 2015 UTC,I signed up at Meridian because a friend works there. I honestly only interact with the staff when I scan my card and say bye when leaving. I go there and workout so I don't speak to them much. The equipment is nice and I've never had an issue there.   Rec centers and IAC are always very very crowded and the equipment is in poor condition or never fixed.  I cancelled with Golds Gym and got charged for 8 months afterward when I had never even set foot in the gym. I was in a month to month and signed a cancellation. (The sign up and cancelation was done all before they opened when it was a dude at a desk in the empty space that was to become the gym.) I had decided it was too far from my house so I signed up with Axiom and liked it and didn't want two active memberships.  Planet fitness is a joke.
Boise,2s0aiz,michaelfour,2,Sun Jan 11 01:11:02 2015 UTC,"If I don't wind up going to the Micron gym before work, I go to Axiom on Parkcenter.  They definitely gave me the fake/corporate feeling the first time I went too, because of the new member orientation.  I work out often, but don't take it nearly as seriously as a lot of people there, and can't imagine spending the kind of money they were asking for their training programs.  But I really like the place now, since it has so much equipment (and a nice pool).  The Meridian Village Axiom has fancy cardio equipment that you can browse the web on, which I really wish the PC one had."

Plus, they have a twenty-four hour pool which is awesome."
Boise,2s0aiz,amavit,2,Sun Jan 11 03:43:05 2015 UTC,"Haha Yeah, funny how things work out sometimes.  I guess I just need to be more open minded and give it another shot."
Boise,2s0aiz,DestryRoyce,3,Mon Jan 12 06:34:16 2015 UTC,I used to go to Axiom Parkcenter but joined Idaho Athletic Club and use their Silverstone (Overland and Eagle) and their State Street locations. Never got any sales pitch or anything. I just do my workout and leave. Exactly what I wanted in a gym.
Boise,2s0aiz,janicuda,3,Sun Jan 11 05:31:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're looking for. Right after the new year is a bad time to judge a gym for being ""overcrowded.""   I absolutely love swimming and think the Ys have the best pools. West has a 50m pool that almost always has an open lane; downtown has a saline pool that's where I did most of my swim team practices growing up. I prefer west for free weights and cardio. Haven't been out to the Caldwell branch yet. The Y has a lot to offer, but since they put effort into so many things, they don't really stand out or excel in one specific thing. Although they really do push for member satisfaction and helping everyone out.  I've never been an axiom member but I've tried a few of their locations. I wasn't a huge fan of the one Fairview/Cole area, but the one on Parkcenter is pretty nice. Both seem to have nice, new, clean equipment and far more free weights than the Y. Nice when things get busy. They also have wider hours than the Y.  Idaho Fitness Factory is also pretty cool. My roommate said their membership is pretty cheap and they're open 24/7. The one that I went to was pretty small, but it also wasn't super busy.  Most gyms offer free trials; I'd suggest starting there to see what you like."
Boise,2s0aiz,janicuda,3,Sun Jan 11 06:09:13 2015 UTC,"It kind of depends what you're looking for... But the park center axiom is extremely legit. Lots of people go there who are very serious about their fitness. You can also go to cross fit gym, yoga studios, or mixed martial arts gyms."
Boise,2s0aiz,asocialrecluse,3,Sun Jan 11 15:34:01 2015 UTC,"Is there a gym that you drive by everyday? Or one that has a super convenient location?    If it's a pain to get to, it will decrease you going.   That said, I love the y downtown. The after New Years crowds are already starting to go away, and with college and high school starting back up, it will be less crowded."

I get to use the Y for free, but it's overcrowded and doesn't have the equipment I enjoy."

No saunas at any locales that I know of, but you can get a free 7-day pass off their website and see if the rest of the facilities meet your needs.    Plus, anytime, yeah?  I go there because my schedule has been all over the place and sometimes it's really nice to go at 2am when literally nobody else is around."

Boise,2s0aiz,derpitydooo,2,Sun Jan 11 16:10:05 2015 UTC,"I go to Axiom, its nice and I just ignore all of the posers there. Any gym you go to will have that. There is Planet Fitness if you want cheap but they have the same atmosphere. They have a more strict dress policy which is kind of stupid. There will be meat-heads and Bro's at any gym you go to, even the YMCA. The New axiom at the village is really nice and has everything you could need. The thing I like about axiom is that there are plenty of machines so if someone is using one you want to use there is always an alternative similar one you can hop on so your not caught waiting to often. I have hopped around to almost every gym around and the basic truth is, they each have posers, fakes, bros etc. you will not find a gym without them. Axiom is your best bet for a big open gym with a variety of weights, a sauna, and a pool. I just put my headphones in before I walk out of the locker room, get in my zone, do my workout, and ignore the posers all around me, that's what you have to do."

But, I'll tell ya -- since then Chinden and Glenwood hit the gym, and got on a routine that has since set them skyward, and they now have a record0setting jump of about 700 vehicles, per HOUR, heading through that intersection.  What do you think about that, Jim?  Jim  Oh man, Bert.  It's nothing short of amazing.  As L.L. Cool J said :""don't call it a comeback"", but Chinden and Glenwood have been sliding through the shadows for three years, working and training, and have obviously shown that they have what it takes to overtake the tops spot.  I mean, moving 7 spots in three years?  That's unbelievable.  Announcer Voice I know.  Do you think they can make it to number one by 2015?  Jim Don't know, but what I can tell you is this: I've seen Chinden and Glenwood do some amazing things over these past three years, and after my interview the other day, I think they have something miraculous up their sleeves.    You'll see what I mean in this short interview I had with them last week in Eagle.  Cut to: Eagle, ID.  Bardenay.  Jim  So, tell me Chinden, Glenwood.  You've made some amazing strides of the past three years.  Moved from 11th place to 3rd on the busiest intersections in Boise polls.  How does it feel, and what have you been doing to accomplish such a might turn-of-events?  Chinden   Uhh, yeah.  Well, uh.  I been, like tryna get more businesses and shit down in my area.  So we got, like pawn shops and tobacco shops showin' up all over the place. Y'know, used books stores and a bunch of little mom and pops things nobody knows about.  And I think that helps us out in the long run, y'know, gettin', like, some low-rent shit down here.  'Course, that all keeps it cheap, so we get some upstart businesses, 'specially breweries showin' up.  And they help bring in the traffic.    Glenwood Exactly.  And I've been helping pull the mall stuff a little further north so that people don't have to feel like they're all isolated to one location for the kinds of things they might like.  Everybody thinks they need to head out to Eagle for shopping and food, but we've got a really great selection of small businesses available.  On the bright side, we've been pushing the idea that this is the quickest route of travel since all the construction showed up on the connector and the freeway heading west over the past few years.  That helped us out a lot.  Jim So you've added a lot of business AND you've tried to steer people your way?  Glenwood  Of course.  When we notice that ACHD is going to do any business anywhere, we make sure to tell our people to put out signs and give sale prices for everything -- if you drive down Glenwood, you'll see all the signs.  in addition, we've taken a but of momentum from Chinden and have added several homegrown businesses that appeal to folks who don't want to hit home with nothing after spending an hour in traffic.  We want people to feel like they're at home by reminding them of the things they don't have: mattresses, pizza, bail bonds you name it.  Chinden  Aw man, that's our shit right there.  Our bread and butter.  We wanna try to appeal to everyone.  So we put it all out there.  Y'know?  Jim  How did you do it?  How did you make this drastic change?  Chinden   Man, for us, it was the Breweries.  Our cheap spaces made them buy it up and then they brought a lot of traffic.  All them snobs from Boise started headin' our way after work to get some beer, knowing they weren't like the people hittin' the smoke shops.  Call 'em snobs or whatever, we appreciate their business.    Glenwood   For me, I thought I wanted all the boutique stores and the chain restaurants.  Turns out I don't.  Though we're shooting for #1 in busiest traffic in 2015 (I hope it's not later), I really do appreciate the change from retail chains to more homegrown and varietal businesses.  Where we were 20 years ago?  Doesn't matter.  Where we're going in the future looks wonderful.  Jim  So you're actively trying to change the culture?  Chinden  Man, fuck that.  I ain't doin' shit.  I just want businesses in my buildings.  Glenwood  And I just want to add stoplights.  Cut to the studio  Jim Amazing talent they both have, don't you think, Bert?  Announcer voice  Couldn't have come from a better pair.  I love what they're doing: pushing traffic, adding stops, and dividing different socio-economic groups along the way.  It's no wonder they've come so far, so quickly.  Stay tuned after the commercials to find out just why ""the Village"" in Meridian is tricking you into thinking you're somewhere special."

Boise,2rnvxn,LobsterLoo,4,Fri Jan 9 06:22:35 2015 UTC,"entrapment   It's only entrapment if the police persuade the mark to do something they wouldn't have done otherwise. In other words, you'd have to make the case that the mark would not have tried to meet a kid for sex if the kid really were a thirteen-year-old instead of cops pretending to be one. If the mark was the first one to make contact, the first one to take the conversation sexual, the first one to invite to meet, etc, it'll be tough to make the case that there was any entrapment here."
Boise,2rnvxn,ABWebUS,-1,Wed Jan 7 22:57:08 2015 UTC,"That's why I wrote entrapment ""aspects."" These stings have been going on long enough that entrapment as a defense has probably already been tried and failed.  However, think about this. How many honeypots have been set, titillating the mark and then the mark chickens out. No arrest can be made. However they may have emboldened the mark who will try again later, maybe through some other venue and possibly succeed since cops can't be everywhere all the time.   Is this so far-fetched? At the very least I'd like to see stats on honeypots which have proceeded all the way to setting a meet-up only to have the mark not show.  And since you seem a bit of an expert, what exactly is the law? Simply arranging a meeting is illegal? Because they're making an arrest before any physical contact.   Seriously downvoter? I guess you're not smart enough to actually write something out."
Boise,2rnvxn,LobsterLoo,3,Thu Jan 8 05:05:46 2015 UTC,"And since you seem a bit of an expert, what exactly is the law?   http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/idstat/Title18/T18CH15SECT18-1509A.htm  Simply put, you commit this crime if you:  -use the internet or other communication device,  -to contact a person who is under 16, or who you believe to be under 16, and  -you entice the person to engage in any sexual act that would be illegal under state law.  No actual sexual contact is required, and there doesn't have to be a real minor involved.   And the crime was probably completed before he even showed up for the meeting - though him actually showing up is solid proof that he was serious about the enticement.   The state would have to prove enticement to engage in a sexual act though - so arranging a meeting isn't enough.  They probably have explicit chat logs."
Boise,2rnvxn,morosco,1 point,Thu Jan 8 23:00:30 2015 UTC,"I would like to see statistics like that too. That being said, I think that if the mark takes things far enough to invite the minor for sexual contact, knowing full well how much trouble that could get them in, then I think things have gone beyond harmless fantasy for them and most are fully willing and able to follow through. I really doubt the number of marks that no-show but then go on to follow through with a ""real"" child are significant.  That being said, if you know of any other strategies to catch these kinds of creeps before they follow through on harming a kid, I'd love to hear it. Personally, I'm betting the fact that these sorts of stings are happening helps stop some borderline would-be predators, especially if they have a job and family - a lot to lose.  As for being an ""expert,"" I'm really not, especially in terms of child endangerment law and such - see morosco's post.

There is always something in the back of my mind that see's these enticement cases as almost going after thought crime, but if you are showing up to a meeting...  I generally just feel sorry for these people, obviously they lack the mental ability to control themselves.  It is most likely the people that will never be caught that are the problem, these people are the lowest of hanging fruit.  I have a hard time with these facebook posters calling for vigilantly justice and reveling in the death of a disturbed person.

It would be nice to see mental health out reach be highlighted in these kind of stories and discussion, if someone this troubled feels nothing but shame and guilt why would they even bother trying to get help in the subject, and even if they did seek help, unfortunately there not going to find the proper channels on these sites.

Leave a 12"" long tail that is oriented at the bottom of the dowel and wrap the wire around the center of the dowel. As you get near the end, leave a 2"" piece angled up with an eyelet at the end to tie your line to. You can adjust the lengths and angles for optimum performance. Attach a bright colored flag to the long end using flagging tape or a piece of plastic.  Rig up and place over the hole. Crack beers and make sure your holes aren't freezing over. When the fish takes it, the tip drops and the flag goes up."

I genuinely hate driving here, especially in Eagle and Meridian (anywhere in the 2C is even worse but I hardly ever go out that way). If Boise and the surrounding area had an honest-to-goodness functioning public transit system I'd never drive at all. I hated all beer until I moved to Boise 8 years ago. I do not any longer. The only way I can see this being true is if you spend all your time driving downtown, and why would you do that if you live in the North End and work and play downtown? Boise has tons of bike access (although it could use a bit more in my opinion) and downtown is very walkable. I can agree that Boise is a (relatively) progressive oasis in a deep red desert. It is my understanding that the political climate is similar around Moscow as well. As is usually the case anywhere in the country nearby a university. I've gotten plenty of thank-you and I'm-sorry waves from people driving around here, especially when I let someone in on I-84 during rush hour. I don't online date, so I can't really refute this. I honestly wish that Boise had a bit more ethnic flavor in its restaurant options. Pub food, pizza, burgers, Mexican, or American fusion is fine once in a while but it gets old pretty quick. If anyone has any suggestions for things outside of the norm I would love to hear them. I will admit that as someone who moved around a lot as a kid and as an adult it still throws me off to hear people talking about a friend they've known since kindergarten that they still regularly run into when out and about. But I don't know about ""everyone has dated everyone."" I've never been to a farmer's market here, and I can't say that I even know where I would go to find one either. The people here are super, super friendly in a very genuine way and it is one of the absolute best things about Boise and the Northwest in general."

Try your best to be east of 13th if you can swing it, also north of fort. But anything within 19th will keep you in a great school district.

Boise,2r5e0k,kosif,12,Sat Jan 3 00:20:00 2015 UTC,"Listen, throwing money away on trying to prevent marriage between two people who love each other is totally more worthwhile than, say, putting this money towards education to up our status as 48th in the nation for education spending. Get your priorities straight, OP. Straight.. get it?"
Boise,2r5e0k,scienceismyjam,1 point,Sat Jan 3 00:55:48 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, all that moola spent on local legal services gets added to the year end State GDP numbers.

Boise,2r5e0k,encephlavator,4,Sat Jan 3 16:00:47 2015 UTC,"Come Republican-primary time, these guys and others in their administration will have to show that they gave this a shot.   That's just the political climate in Idaho.   It's easy to voice your opinion on reddit, but there's not enough of you, and the ones that do exist barely even vote.   And I think it'd be kind of cool if the Supreme Court took one of these cases, and the landmark Supreme Court case that recognized this federal constitutional right came out of Idaho, and listed Otter as one of the parties.  If you're someone who thinks Idaho shouldn't pursue this because despite the voter mandate, there's no way they can win, you shouldn't be afraid of that possibility.   The Court coming out that way would recognize that right EVERYWHERE in America - not such a terrible outcome.  An outcome worth the money, I'd say.  There's still 14 states where same-sex marriage is not legal.   And the money really is peanuts in the grand scheme of things.   I've said this before here, but look how much rich, well-connected Idahoans rob from the education fund by getting favorable tax assessments on property and cottage site leases.   That's something Wasden has fought  against, but it will never go away, and it costs the state way, way, more than paying a couple of lawyers for this case.   And, at the end of the day, they'll be awarded attorney fees, which means that the brave people who pursued this from the very beginning don't have to pay for their legal fight, not a bad thing either."
Boise,2r5e0k,morosco,4,Sat Jan 3 16:43:41 2015 UTC,"If you're someone who thinks Idaho shouldn't pursue this because despite the voter mandate...   One of the most beautiful things about American Democracy is the protection against the ""tyranny of the majority"". Just because the voters think something may be right, that does not make it just. I am glad we have tools at our disposal to correct this sort of situation.  I would be keen to see the Supreme Court side with the idea of marriage equality based on the Idaho case being ridiculous."
Boise,2r5e0k,morosco,3,Sat Jan 3 18:04:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that's the role of the judicial branch, not the executive or the legislature.   The executive branch should enforce the laws of the state, not what they wish the laws were.   That may not seem clear in this context when you don't like the law, it would be if you did."
Boise,2r5e0k,reqorium,2,Sat Jan 3 18:10:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. That's why I'm glad it's being taken to the Judicial branch for a final decision. One of the great things about justice is that it can prevail, whether I like the way it does or I don't.  I am happy that Mr. Otter sees to his duty, I just wish he could recognize that in this particular case the resources of our state are being wasted. Nationwide we have been seeing anti equality laws being struck down."

Boise,2r4zbu,snuxoll,2,Fri Jan 2 23:55:04 2015 UTC,"Operating SPECIFIC businesses in Boise without proper licensing is punishable, let's be clear here.  There is a clear list of business licenses that may be required in the City of Boise clearly available on the city website. These licensing requirements may seem unfair, but ultimately they are there for public and worker safety in most cases (child care facilities, restaurants, establishments selling alcohol, massage facilities), and in a few because of regulation (pawnbrokers, vehicle towing, TAXI SERVICES).  Taxi services need to be licensed for both reasons, there is a real, demonstrable public safety issue with Taxi services, you don't want to get into a vehicle with someone that could potentially decide to murder you, after all; of course Uber handles this with the same background checks the city would require.  However, Taxi services in Boise are also regulated, and fares are the same for every Taxi service in Boise because the city government controls said rates. In a way this is anti-competitive because it prevents good old free market economics, but it also prevents the excessive price gouging Uber is known for with ""surge pricing"". If you want to play ball in Boise, you have to play by the same rules that everyone else does."
Boise,2r4zbu,elracoono,4,Sat Jan 3 18:52:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think govt. regulation has anything to do with preventing a taxi murder. Fares are not the same for every taxi, because I've been charged a huge range of fares between 8th street and my house. At least with surge pricing, I can make that choice to pay a higher fare in advance. Not a ""woops, this is 7 bucks more than last weekend for the same distance! But im already at my house, so he knows where I live.""   For me, the Uber app is way more convenient than dealing with people near the cab stands on 8th street. It makes it super easy to split fares. The City is welcome to develop a similar app for cabs to use. Hell, maybe the cabs could pay the city a premium to use it."

Boise,2r4zbu,darkstar999,9,Fri Jan 2 21:31:14 2015 UTC,"They're a public safety risk if they can't be regulated.   Inadequate background checks, safety issues, lack of commercial insurance if people are injured or killed."
Boise,2r4zbu,morosco,2,Fri Jan 2 21:39:51 2015 UTC,I'm seeing no regulation on all the taxi drivers running red lights.
Boise,2r4zbu,darkstar999,-2,Sat Jan 3 00:19:44 2015 UTC,"So basically the City is trying to babysit us. Uber drivers get background checks, they are insured, and they require newer model vehicles. There is no reason for this ban in the name of safety. You can even see feedback about a driver (""creepy dude"") before calling it, which you can't do with regular cabs. The city needs to back off and go back to planning a better potato drop for 2015."
Boise,2r4zbu,morosco,13,Fri Jan 2 21:48:30 2015 UTC,"Do you oppose regulation of businesses generally or only when it's a business you like?

The city isn't banning them because of their shady practices.  I don't oppose regulation, I oppose unnecessary regulation. Uber already background checks and insures their drivers. I don't know how the city can call this a safety issue at this point. They are just protecting the existing cab industry that won't keep up without being propped up by government.  Background checks: ✓  Insurance: ✓  Driver reviews: ✓  Minimum vehicle standards: ✓  What more could they require in the name of safety? Should Mayor Bieter hold your hand on the ride home?"
Boise,2r4zbu,snuxoll,3,Fri Jan 2 22:15:49 2015 UTC,"The city isn't banning them, they sent a cease-and-desist letter because Uber violated their agreement to operate without a license as long as they weren't charging.   If they're going to be a business, they need a business license."
Boise,2r4zbu,darkstar999,-4,Fri Jan 2 22:20:21 2015 UTC,A cease-and-desist letter is banning them (if only temporarily). They are threatening the drivers with prosecution.  Do you know why they don't have an agreement yet?
Boise,2r4zbu,Mr_Slick,2,Fri Jan 2 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, and do you know why the DRIVERS are the target? Because they are independent contractors, so they themselves are the business providing the service.  This is the bullshit tactic that Uber has used to protect itself, they don't actually ""provide"" the transport, just the tool to find it and handle billing, so they aren't required to get all of these licenses, right?  Honestly, it's about time a city stopped trying to go after Uber directly, it's unfair but this is the only way their shitty business model is going to get exposed for what it is."

The Fiesta is usually in the 8.0 Nielsen Rating range but it has historically been on January 1st or 2nd in prime-time. For comparison the 2007 Oklahoma game was an 8.4 and the 2010 TCU game was an 8.2. A 4.6 rating is still pretty impressive for an afternoon game that wasn't on a national holiday.

My personal favorite is Kibrom's. I've been there 3 times in the last 2 weeks. Kibrom and his family are so sweet, and the food is to die for. I highly recommend the red tibs. It comes on a giant sourdough pancake that has the consistency of a crepe (called injera). Or, you can have rice. Either starch choice is unlimited with your meal. Each of the meals comes with a side salad as well, lightly dressed with a simple, delicious vinegarette. All that for about $8.50. They have combo plates that start with two items at about $9.00 and range up to around $11 for 4 choices, I believe. Don't quote me though, this is by memory."

Boise,2qp048,TuffAdams,-7,Tue Dec 30 01:34:37 2014 UTC,"As a libertarian, I couldnt care less who marries who, but since this issue was put to a vote by the citizens of Idaho and they overwhelmingly voted against gay marriage, it was the duty of Governor Otter to fight the ruling. Why should the government have to pay the legal fees?"
Boise,2qp048,TuffAdams,6,Mon Dec 29 11:38:29 2014 UTC,"I think the Governor was overstating his duty. I don't know that he had a constitutional obligation to defend the suit. I think he could have looked at recent circuit court rulings around the country and could see which way the wind was blowing, so to speak.   As to why the government should have to pay the fees, that's the way our legal system works: loser pays."
Boise,2qp048,caseyoc,-4,Mon Dec 29 11:54:24 2014 UTC,"We are a representative republic. It doesn't matter how the ""wind blows"" in other states but how the wind is blowing in the state that elected him. His duty is to govern by the will of the people and the vote that was cast showed that the will of the people of Idaho was that marriage is defined between one man and one woman. Again, I don't care about this issue one iota but the majority of the people if Idaho do so Otter was compelled to do what he did.  As for the loser pays, that is not the way the legal system works."
Boise,2qp048,ReverandDave,10,Mon Dec 29 14:17:48 2014 UTC,"The suit determined that the state of Idaho was denying a basic human right.  Ergo, Idaho is fiscally responsible for the cost incurred in restoring that right."

Boise,2qp048,ReverandDave,1 point,Mon Dec 29 15:25:42 2014 UTC,"And the federal courts are now weighing on that, that's their role.   But the question here is whether state governments should weigh in before the courts do and refuse to enforce state laws that haven't been deemed unconstitutional at the moment, but likely will be in the future.   It's great if you don't agree with the law, that tension really isn't there if you like the end result anyway.   But what if the state government refused to enforce a law you liked that was supported by the people?   I don't think there's an obvious answer to this stuff - the relationship between the branches is pretty grey and fascinating.   Edit: And the legal bills, while unnecessary (even if they felt they needed to defend this, it should have been handled by cheaper state attorneys on salaries), really aren't that significant in the grand scheme of things.   Well-connected Idahoans steal much more from the state with rigged property and lease valuations.  At least this is transparent."
Boise,2qp048,JJHall_ID,4,Mon Dec 29 19:01:29 2014 UTC,"In the end, the state will have spent more money to try to save a bigoted law than just let it be.

The money blown by Butch to have a rigteous crusade against people he finds personally distasteful could have at least helped prop up the states stagnating wages, but that doesn't fall in line with zealoted bigotry the likes our state's politicians are known for.   Cronyism and corruption are just part and parcel when you allow one party to run the show for so long as Idahoans have."

Boise,2qp048,ReverandDave,-9,Mon Dec 29 20:56:55 2014 UTC,Protecting what rights? Marriage is a religious institution. There could have been a compromise that allowed civil unions and then you wouldn't have drawn the ire of the religious right. That pill would have gone down way easier than the one people were forcing down everyone's throat.
Boise,2qp048,TuffAdams,10,Mon Dec 29 15:33:14 2014 UTC,"Marriage isn't a religious institution, it's a civil one.  The state was sued for violating civil rights and in civil litigation, the loser pays the court costs.  That's why the state has to pay the court costs, not the plaintiffs.  I know the religious right has been beating this ""religious institution"" drum, but it's simply not true.  The only reason marriage even existed in a religious sense was as a means of property management.  Well, property managment has moved into the millieu of the state (sorry to burst your bubble).  The state has no reason to recognize a religious institution for any reason other than to not discriminate against for or against it.  That's why there's no legal protections from or for being excommunicated, christened, or baptized.  And yes, that is how our legal system works."
Boise,2qp048,ReverandDave,-12,Mon Dec 29 15:48:48 2014 UTC,"We will have to agree to disagree. Marriage might have play a property role in Protestant religions but in the oldest Christian religion which is Roman Catholicism, it means much, much more. If that wasn't the case, then it would be easier for non-Catholics to marry Catholics. It is considered one of the Seven Sacraments on the Faith and the Catholic Church stands clear on this issue.  Again, I think the goal of this fight was to remove a point of power from Christians than it was an issue of equal rights. If it wasn't, then a simple civil union would have sufficed to reach the goal. Gays and lesbians want to be recognized as regular couples in a 2000 year old institution that for 20 centuries regards homosexual relationships as a sin against God and nature. THIS is why you have the fight."
Boise,2qp048,JJHall_ID,6,Mon Dec 29 16:34:58 2014 UTC,"It is super easy for catholics to marry non catholics.  My first wife was catholic. All you have to do is realize that the church doesn't have/need/deserve a place in your marriage because marriage is a legal institution, not a church institution.  Churches may be involved, but any involvement is completely voluntary on the part of the petitioners.  That part hasn't changed and likely won't until christianity as a whole can get over the fact that homosexuality is a completely natural part of life, and not a damnable sin.  Hell, I even had a mormon bishop do the ceremony (because he was a personal friend, not because I'm mormon).  He's a tip for you, most people, catholics included, couldn't give a wet fart about the ""Seven Sacraments on the Faith"" and nor should they have to unless they want to, it shouldn't be compulsory.   Again, I think the goal of this fight was to remove a point of power from Christians than it was an issue of equal rights.    Get off your cross.  Christians are making this fight about them when they have nothing to do with it.  Marriage hasn't been a religious institution since sensible and secular government took control.  Especially that part about freedom of religion.  The fact that jews, hindu's, muslims, zoroastrians, ba'hai, and athiests can freely get married without having to jump through all that biblical bullshit should be proof enough that the church does not nor should it own something as important as marriage.  If you think that this fight actually concerns you, then you are either gay or have a gay relative because otherwise it has fuck all to do with you, your church, your faith, or your god and inserting that in there is not only short sighted, it's ignorant and cruel.  If some Christians (because not all do) feel that their power is being revoked well, maybe they should because like so many other things, they've proven that they can't be trusted with that power.  They have been abusive and exclusive and shouldn't be allowed to discriminate based on silly superstitions written by goat herders that know less then about how the world works than my 6 yo son knows today.  We just landed a satellite on a freaking comet, it's time to put bronze age thoughts behind us."
Boise,2qp048,dachusa,3,Mon Dec 29 20:01:13 2014 UTC,"We just landed a satellite on a freaking comet, it's time to put bronze age thoughts behind us.   Thank you for nearly making me laugh out loud.  That is one of the most shockingly true statements I've read all day."
Boise,2qp048,JJHall_ID,4,Mon Dec 29 23:20:49 2014 UTC,"Marriage is fundamentally a religious ceremony/ideal, however since it was mixed into state as a legal element, the argument of equality no longer concerns the religious aspect.  Constitutionally religion is protected and as we are all aware, which extends to the idea of separation of church and state.     ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion""   Based upon this fundamental concept of the constitution, the concept of legal marriage and religious marriage, must be accepted as two different elements.  Legal marriage must be granted to all, without discrimination as defined by our constitution and amendments.  Religious marriage should be permitted to discriminate on a basis of matching the ideals and values of the religious institution performing the ceremony.  With this idea, any laws/ordinances that require someone to perform ceremonies against their values should be repealed. Right to refuse service needs to extend to all services, unless you are a government department/employee."
Boise,2qp048,TuffAdams,5,Mon Dec 29 19:59:41 2014 UTC,"Marriage has been around before even Roman Catholicism.  Pagans had handfasting.  In Greek mythology, Hera was the goddess of marriage.  The claim Christians lay to marriage is pretty absurd when you get down to it.  That would be like Dell claiming to be the inventors of the computer.  Sure most people using computers today don't remember the old original IBM personal computers, or the Simon kits, but that certainly doesn't give Dell the exclusive claim to the term ""PC"" today.  I don't think it is a goal of the gays and lesbians to ""take a point of power from Christians.""  They aren't demanding that churches be compelled to perform marriages for them.  All they're asking for is for the civil marriages to be allowed and recognized.  They want the benefits of marriage, such as tax benefits, insurance benefits, estate planning, parental rights, etc.  None of those have anything to do with the Christian side of marriage.  From a practical standpoint, not using ""civil union"" as the term is beneficial.  It literally means the same thing with the same benefits as far as the civil side goes.  Calling it a ""civil union"" legally would mean needing to rework all of the laws to say ""marriage or civil union.""  You'd have to duplicate the forms used, one for ""marriage"" and one for ""civil union"" or you'd have to rework the forms to have a checkbox for which one is being performed.  You'll introduce confusion as people will wonder which they should select if they're not highly-religious.  Then you get the tertiary problems down the line as when someone asks if they're married, ""No, we're part of a civil union.""  Choosing to keep the accepted term, ""marriage,"" is actually the least ""intrusive"" thing they could have asked for.  As I've said numerous times, if Christians (or anyone) opposing using the term marriage on the grounds that it violates the ""sanctity"" of marriage, they should probably take a look at their own marriage.  If allowing same-sex marriage makes their own marriage mean less, they've got far deeper issues."
Boise,2qp048,JJHall_ID,-5,Mon Dec 29 22:03:19 2014 UTC,I think that a lesbian couple suing a small business owner for not making them a wedding cake proves my point better than anything you just wrote. You are now saying one person's right trump another person's rights when religious freedom was the main reason most people immigrated to the Americas. Now we are back where we started from.
Boise,2qp048,desertkestrel,7,Mon Dec 29 22:23:47 2014 UTC,"Should the small business be able to deny making a cake on the basis that the person ordering it is male?  Female?  How about black or Hispanic?  What about a couple of which one (or both) partners are previously divorced?  Why would sexual orientation be any different?  Again with the separation of religion-based prejudice vs. civil law and protection of classes.  Was the lesbian couple ordering the cake breaking a law or health code by doing so?  No, therefore they should not have been denied service and the shop owner was likely breaking a law by doing so.  Really when it comes down to it, the shop owners were being extremely hypocritical to begin with.  If they're Christian, they're supposed to love their neighbors, and love the sinner but not the sin.  They were passing their own judgement of the couple by denying the order, rather than loving them despite their ""sin,"" and letting the Creator judge them someday.  I'm sure they wear clothing of mixed materials too, but that Biblical teaching must not apply to them as it is too inconvenient."
Boise,2qp048,JJHall_ID,3,Mon Dec 29 23:09:52 2014 UTC,"It's peculiar to me you bring up a point of Catholic (religious) policy to try to argue against a civil function.    If that wasn't the case, then it would be easier for non-Catholics to marry Catholics.   The state does not care whether a Catholic marries a non-Catholic. The RC church cares a whole bunch, they make their own rules about who they will or wont marry.   The state does not regulate this. The state does not check to see if the Roman Catholic church is hunky dory with a mixed-religion marriage before issuing a license. Religious institutions are not obligated to solemnize any old marriage license. But they are also not necessary to the process."
Boise,2qp048,JJHall_ID,8,Mon Dec 29 23:21:42 2014 UTC,"If marriage is a religious institution, then the state has no business regulating it period.  Why is the state involved in keeping church records (marriage licenses) and why are state courts involved in the dissolution of those unions (divorce court?)  While marriage may have originated in the church (which is debatable, marriage/partnerships existed long before the Christian church) it is most certainly a civil institution now.  This leads me back to questioning why we're now trying to apply religious beliefs to this civil institution.  If a church doesn't want to provide marriage services for a gay couple, it doesn't have to.  To my knowledge very few of these couples are seeking a church marriage.  If this ""majority"" of the people feel so strongly that the sanctity of their own marriage will somehow be harmed by allowing same-sex couples to marry, then they probably should examine the flaws in their own marriage first."
Boise,2qp048,willsueforfood,7,Mon Dec 29 16:00:21 2014 UTC,"I lean toward the libertarian side as well, and I differ on your interpretation.  I wholeheartedly agree that anyone should be able to marry anyone else, I can think of no reason to prevent it in this day and age that doesn't go back to a certain traditional book.  And that is fine, but the beliefs derived from that book have no business being codified into law.  I think all true libertarians will agree on the separation of church and state.  Where I stray from your opinion is on what Otter's ""duty"" entails.  To me, while standing up for the ""voters' will"" is an important part of it, I don't believe he should be doing so blindly.  If that was the case, why have him in there to begin with, just do everything with a majority vote and hire enforcers.  While there could be some argument when the first battle started, by the time the later iterations of the lawsuit were pursued it was blatantly obvious that the supreme court was ruling that the DOMA-esque laws in the states were counter to the basic rights afforded to US citizens, and therefore null and void.  Once that became obvious, he had a duty to tell Idahoans that it is a lost battle, and it is financially irresponsible to continue fighting it as is.  He should have let it die the first time, but instead let his own personal beliefs cloud his judgement and has now cost Idaho taxpayers another half-million in the process.  For this reason alone I feel he is no longer competent to hold the office he does.    Unfortunately we have a ""tyranny of the majority"" here in Idaho right now, which votes in this discriminatory and bigoted crap, then re-elects leadership that embraces that bigotry.  Idaho has worked so hard in the last 20 years to shed the image of being ""just a bunch of skinheads and back woods nut-jobs.""  It is unfortunate to see all of that work destroyed over such a dumb issue that should never have been an issue in the first place."

Boise,2qnqq6,Shwanna85,3,Mon Dec 29 01:36:42 2014 UTC,"There ARE leagues! How good are you? Every weekend there is open gym volleyball at Fort Boise Community Center. Sat 9-1 and Sun 10-4 something like Sep thru May? Usually one side of the gym is for more power players and the other side is for rec players. Show up and you will meet people:) Co-ed season is winding down so you'll have to wait til the summer to get in on that action. I asked how good you are because I'm trying to put a women's team together (starts in Feb) We will be pretty competitive so I will have to uninvite you if you ain't up to snuff. But if you show up to open gym over the weekends then you will meet people and you could potentially put your own team together or get in on someone else's team :) I know a girl who is trying to put together a team in the lower divisions and will happily pass you on to her:)  As for co-ed. All summer long there are tournaments and (if you go to open gym this winter) you can get on a list for pick-up games (these are not run by the city). The summer tournaments (city run) happen at Julia Davis on Mondays and I think it starts in July. Be there at 6 or you wont get on a team and if you are not a competitive player then go to Thursdays at 6 instead (I'd recommend thursday first just to get familiar w the attitudes and rules, Monday folks can be pretty vicious if you show up unprepared) I know that there are summer double leagues but I have never played so I don't know who you talk to about that. It does sound really fun though so I will probably be finding out soon. Good luck! Hope to see you at Fort Boise!  P.S. People occasionally bring kids and most of the time they are perfectly fine but if they aren't prepared to stay out of the way people will make it very clear that the child is a nuisance.    Hopefully this was enough information to get you going. I've played for YEARS through the city and it has been a great addition to my life:)"

There are different ""styles"" of counseling, the most popular current one being Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Any decent therapist will not be insulted in the slightest if you don't feel you're a good match, and they should be happy to refer you to someone they and you think is more your speed. If you'd like some more personal advice, feel free to pm me, I have an unfortunately large amount of experience on the topic."

Boise,2qiyy2,joshburt,6,Sun Dec 28 08:41:42 2014 UTC,Fellow sufferer here.  I've been dealing with depression for over a decade and also live in Boise.  I've done counciling as well as medication.   This time of year in Boise the seasonal depression can really kick in.  I'd recommend one of two routes for you.  Unfortunately I do not have specific recommendations for councilors.   Assuming you have access to EAP (employee assistance programs) from your work you can get a set number of counciling sessions for free.  Just do the intro interview(s) and get help.  Its confidential and no one at your work is involved or even aware. Talk to your family doctor or pick one!  Now is the time and you will be visiting this person for medication refills.   The counciling is good for talking things through and getting tips for dealing with your situation.  I would definitely recommend medication if you are wandering in major depression territory.    Picking the right medication can also be a trial and error process as some will work better for you than others.  Good luck and remember that you are never alone.

Boise,2q7lmo,panda_foo,1 point,Tue Dec 23 23:44:46 2014 UTC,Thanks for the info. Definitely good to know before driving up there

Boise,2q7lmo,thespudbud,1 point,Wed Dec 24 01:35:53 2014 UTC,"Someone else might be able to help me here, but somewhere along this 8th Street road there is a gate. Last time I went up there the gate was locked and there wasn't a wide place to turn around. I managed to make a 3-point U-turn, but the poor guy behind me was towing a toyhauler and he had to go in reverse really slow down the road until he found a place to turn around. Just a warning in case you were planning on towing a trailer up there... I'm not sure when the gate is locked or unlocked."

Boise,2q7lmo,Spanish_Echo,1 point,Wed Dec 24 02:27:45 2014 UTC,"There's  a couple of gates on 8th. One after the last driveway heading up and one at the top. You can go up Bogus and a couple miles before the parking lot you will see a dirt road to the right with a stop sign. That will take you to 8th or if you keep going it you end up at Rocky Canyon. From there you can drop down to the right and come out at the neighborhood below Tablerock.  If you go left it drops you into Robie Creek, be careful going that way because you can end up on private roads if you aren't  careful. From Robie you can head out by the end of Lucky Peak to 21 or work your way back farther and come out Grimes Creek. There are no gates if you go from the Bogus end but there can be lots of snow and ice so be prepared if you try, very easy to get yourself stuck up there this time of year."
Boise,2q7lmo,Silverbug,3,Wed Dec 24 00:52:41 2014 UTC,"If you're heading to the Boise National Forest, check out their off road management regulations before you head out.

This can be a tricky time of year higher in the mountains--please leave an itinerary/plan with someone so they know where to go looking for you in case you get stuck or stranded."
Boise,2q7lmo,reflectivity,2,Tue Dec 23 21:10:58 2014 UTC,"It depends on which direction you want to go.  If you go north, there are some great roads off Highway 21 and on the road from Banks to Lowman.  If you go south, you have Silver City, Bruneau Canyon area, and a pretty good ride out of Melba starting at Jump Creek.  East would be Highway 21 outside of Idaho City towards Centerville and West will take you out to the Emmett Off Road park (http://www.riderplanet-usa.com/atv/trails/info/idaho_13362/ride_1ff8.htm).

That turns to dirt and will dump you out just outside of Council on Hwy 95. Also up there, if you follow the same road, you can make the first right after it turns to dirt, follow it to the next left, and its a dirt road that goes to the lookout on top of Squaw Butte and a beautiful view of Bogus, Emmett, and the Boise valley."

Boise,2q0f34,TheLionGoesMoo,6,Sun Dec 21 22:51:03 2014 UTC,You might have better luck near Boise State. If you get in early summer before returning students you'll have some good options. Most apartments and rentals in the area don't expect much credit from their clientele who are typically college students. The cole and ustick area is a family neighborhood with some apartments so they might not be as willing to rent to four guys as a place near BSU.
Boise,2q0f34,lifeasapeach,6,Mon Dec 22 05:55:21 2014 UTC,"Unless things have changed since I first rented 14 years ago (they may well have) no credit is not a problem. It's bad credit or bad renter's history that will cause a problem. As long as you all can verify employment, that should be enough. For a four bedroom place, you are probably looking at $1000-$1500/month. Zillow or Craigslist might be a good place to look. Only piece of advice I have for you is that earplugs make good roomates. Good luck."
Boise,2q0f34,dregan,7,Mon Dec 22 02:39:10 2014 UTC,"In this market, with low vacancy rates, landlords are much more selective and will take someone with credit over someone without. It's a harder market to rent in, especially a standalone house."
Boise,2q0f34,BSUbluNorange,7,Mon Dec 22 04:31:36 2014 UTC,"Do not try to make roommates out of friends. You won't be friends by the end of it, or your relationship will suffer, I guarantee it.   Also, 4 dudes in a house gets old after a while, especially when it becomes 4 dudes and 4 dudes girlfriends.   Besides, the common area will always be occupied, and if your living space is next to it, good luck getting any sleep without pissing anyone off by asking them to be quiet.   I'm not saying it can't be done, and you'll probably disregard what I've said here. I've just tried this, and it wasn't worth the hassle in the end. I feel that you'd be much better off renting a place with just 1 other person. The options are greater, and the time and money savings would easily be worth it."
Boise,2q0f34,Sterling_____Archer,3,Mon Dec 22 15:05:48 2014 UTC,"A few friends of mine and I are trying to move into a new house here in Boise. Like it was said already $1000-1500 for rent, but, for most places, your income as a group will need to be 3x the monthly rent. one place said that each of you had to have that. So be warned about that. If we get into the place we applied for and I remember I will try and follow up because none of us have good credit (one just finished a bankruptcy) and we are a little older (23-27). Good luck."
Boise,2q0f34,TheAngryCelt,3,Mon Dec 22 05:59:35 2014 UTC,"After high school I rented a huge house with three guys up by overland and cole (about 5-6 years ago) and there wasn't a problem with our limited credit history. It was a cheap area to live but honestly, you'd probably have more fun living closer to the university.   Also, you could browse craigslist for private owners renting their place out because they are sometimes a little bit more lenient on history. They do more of an ""interview"" than a credit check but these are probably less common."
Boise,2q0f34,goldsoundzz,2,Mon Dec 22 08:12:05 2014 UTC,Thanks for the help all! I'll be sure to talk to the managers and see what they say.

Boise,2q0f34,RedPhalcon,1 point,Mon Dec 22 02:33:08 2014 UTC,"I live in that area, and I can tell you the options are sparse.  That being said, if you do find a place it's a nice neighborhood.  We rented our place two years ago and had terrible credit, so all is not lost there.  As far as the general roommate things goes, SET THE RULES NOW!  Make sure everyone is on the same page as far as cleaning, food, etc is concerned.  Especially set rules about how you wish to share the communal area, as improper communication can lead to drama, but good boundaries can lead to late night Super Smash Brothers tournaments.  Make sure there's an understanding about significant others and expectations there too.  Communication is key.  Avoid passive aggression, but also have some tolerance for odd habits of the others in the house.  Also, If the place has a garage I recommend a second fridge.  Four people can fill it up fast."

Boise,2pnn6y,Socific,12,Thu Dec 18 05:30:20 2014 UTC,"I think that most people under forty would be interested in municipal fiber, if they knew what it was. If you really want this to happen the first thing to do is spread awareness and educate people that this is an option. You can do that by handing out free flyers at events telling people how and when they can get involved, answering questions, and having a contact list for possible volunteers to sign up. Getting people to give their tax money away to something as expensive as city-wide municipal fiber is no easy task. In Boise however, it's doable.  TL;DR - Yes."

Boise,2pnn6y,encephlavator,2,Thu Dec 18 15:05:55 2014 UTC,"To expand on seismicgear's comment... find out where it's already being done and determine how well it's working there. I haven't been keeping up, but what's the deal with google fiber in Kansas City?  Frankly, I think it's going to go all broadband wireless and wired connections are going to end up like the railroad industry.  I'm going further off topic, but the people just don't care or they wouldn't be paying the outrageous prices they are for cellular. Take a look at /r/nocontract for a bit. One example: T-Mobile MVNO (cellular reseller) Ultra Mobile is offering no contract cell service starting at $19/mo unlim talk/text and 100MB data, with easy option to add more data ala carte. This is 1/2 the cheapest TMO plan. Yet, TMO, Cricket etc. are still signing up people left and right to 2 year contracts at $50 or $60 per month. Ultra is even offering $99 for a year if you pay in advance. That's $8 per month plus any extra data you want to add ala carte, even so, it's far cheaper than TMO or anyone else.   Regarding educating people: I talk about the MVNOs to some friends who are still paying $30/mo for a land line or $80/mo for Sprint with a crappy flip phone, they're getting totally gouged yet they're too scared to change. They think just because it's cheaper then something must be wrong."

Other than that, they seem pretty satisfied with the speed. The resident IPs are less than pleased.   I have an MVNO, I'm on Ting. Bill is about $15/mo but I'm not a heavy data user. My friends are stuck on the big carriers who are taking them to the bank with $100+ for their lines, it's insane."
Boise,2pnn6y,JJHall_ID,5,Thu Dec 18 17:15:44 2014 UTC,"Is $53/mo for unlimited 50down/2up that bad? That's what I pay thru cableone. Yes, I signed a contract. I'm just not that motivated to improve the speeds more than that right now."
Boise,2pnn6y,JJHall_ID,3,Thu Dec 18 22:21:17 2014 UTC,"59.50/mo for the same speeds with CableOne Business with a 3 year contract.  That is full amount taxes included.  No ports blocked, no caps, and priority support/repair, and modem lease included.  The extra $7 is well worth it.  No we don't have Gigabit service here in the Treasure Valley, but I have to agree with you.  CableOne service just works and works well.  Independent speed tests constantly return with slightly over what I pay for, ping times are good, jitter is low.  I really don't know what the complaint is about them.  That said, I wish they did have some competition to help force prices down a little or return more speed for the price.  Their closest competitor (if you want to call it that) for a small/home office is Century Link, which can be anywhere from 1 Mbps up through 7 or 12 depending on where you live, maybe 40 in some areas of Boise.  Because of the extra encapsulation on DSL lines you have to mess with your MTU, which is a bummer if you transfer a lot of files between PCs on your own LAN."
Boise,2pnn6y,k1ngm1nu5,4,Thu Dec 18 23:39:46 2014 UTC,"CableOne is pretty sucky for its peering points around here.. Latency ends up super high. Also they have no plans to deploy IPv6 anytime soon. =/  Also, they do the %85 cancelation fee with business contracts. So if you sign up you have to pay %85 of the remaining balance to cancel. So canceling in 1 year costs $1,213 in ETF, and two years costs $606. And last I heard they automatically renew for 3 years when your term expires.. That really sucks."
Boise,2pnn6y,reqorium,1 point,Fri Dec 19 16:23:26 2014 UTC,"Where are you seeing the latency?  I have issues with skype calls occasionally, but even when experiencing slowdowns on Skype, all testing I've performed said the connection details are all A-OK.  My wife complains about games once in a while, but again I can never point to our connection as the issue.  If  I'm genuinely interested on where you're seeing the issues so I can track it down myself if it is in fact CableOne and attempt to get it resolved.  Yes, they do have a large cancellation fee on their business contracts.  Most business contracts do.  You don't have to sign a long-term contract, you can just pay the higher month-to-month rate.  When you sign up you're agreeing to give them X revenue over Y time, which they combine with all of their other contracts to plan their expenses over that time period.  In exchange they give you a discount on your monthly fees.  Letting customers out of a contract with no penalty pretty much negates the point of a contract in the first place.  As for 3-year auto-renew, that is not the case.  In addition to my 50x2 I just renewed for a 2nd 3 year term (had to sign a new contract to do so) I also manage a 50x2 line and a 75x5 line we use for backups at my company.  The 50x2 line just expired, and we chose not to renew it due to no longer needing it shortly.  It dropped to the new 30x2 plan they currently offer at the month-to-month rate.  I've got no skin in the game other than I have a few CableOne lines I manage, I'm not trying to shill for them.  If there was another provider that was better I'd have no qualms switching.  Edit to add: I do agree with you on the IPv6 issue.  I just contacted my rep Wednesday in fact to see if they've made any progress as I'd like to start working with it.  The response is as follows:   I just received this question about a month ago from a different customer, I called and talked with our engineers at our corporate office and they said we are still status quo as of now.  They said it will happen in the future there is just no time frame as of right now.  I know that probably does not help you, but that is what I know as of now..   I have to admit that is a pretty disappointing response, especially considering CableOne was a participant in the worldwide IPv6 day a couple of years back."
Boise,2pnn6y,Woodre,2,Fri Dec 19 18:52:23 2014 UTC,"So if I attempt to get to the POP in Utah I am handed off to Century Link in Seattle.

Boise,2pnn6y,gokudluffy,3,Sat Dec 20 23:09:46 2014 UTC,"The cost would be astronomical and sadly you won't find the right people anywhere near where it is feasible. Most cities doing municipal broadband are doing it via overhead wires which is something Boise has very little of since snow has a bad habit of breaking them. This limits feasible deployment to the area right off broadway basically and having lived over there it is mostly older folks and BSU students, neither of which will be able to afford it which means that the whole thing would be subsidized by the other areas of Boise which is the second problem. Idaho requires 66% majority on a vote in order to get bond issues passed, and historically we are not very willing to pass most issues unless they are ""critical"".  Keep in mind that a good chunk of people that would be willing to spend money on a project like this actually live in Meridian/Eagle. Your target audience is actually really spread out.  I talked with a friend at Google about Google Fiber when they were selecting new cities and he told me basically that Boise was taken off the list of possible cities almost right from the get go for the above reasons.  Now that being said, my dream would be to get WebPass to either license its wireless technology, or start an office here. They target urban buildings, but ideally with such an awesome mountain and elevation situation here they could do much the same in a far more workable localized setup.. But who knows, they seem to think that the density is nowhere near good enough around here."
Boise,2pnn6y,Zipod,2,Thu Dec 18 17:03:28 2014 UTC,That does seem like a big hurdle - the infrastructure. And that's also the part that I'm not very well versed on. Would putting it underground be an option? Or forcing the existing ISPs to let us piggyback?  I need to look more into Webpass...
Boise,2pnn6y,forgotpassword69,2,Fri Dec 19 07:31:46 2014 UTC,"underground means that you have to tear up every street which gets very, very expensive. An underground deployment at best will cost upwards of $25 a foot to deploy (vs something like $1 a foot with hung cables.) Mind you, if you do above ground here then the snow will stretch the fiber which in turn will cause them to crack and break so underground is the ""right way"".  ISP's used to be forced to share lines but the FCC has basically done away with that. It never really worked out all that well as it only worked for DSL and basically could never work for cable (due to the way the protocol is setup). Either way, changing that would require a state wide law change that would be challenged at every step. Expect 10+ years of legal wrangling before it is deployed.  Webpass is a building to building wireless protocol. It is deployed in some major cities already and can do speeds of several hundred megs a second which is not great, but is MUCH better than what we have in Boise at the moment.  Your next problem is that Boise is going to be crazy expensive for bulk bandwidth. It was always on the order of 3 times more expensive than Salt Lake City, and SLC cost something like $3k for a 10G uplink. And since you need two (so you can do maintenance) you are talking something like $15k a month in cost for the upstream bandwidth. You need nearly 500 customers at $35 a month just to break even. Plus you need to add the thousands of dollars for the edge routers, fiber from Deer Point to whatever office you end up running out of, etc. In the end you will likely have at least $50k in monthly operating costs pre-people. This means that if you are going to make this work it needs to be big.. it can't be a 10 person operation, it has to have thousands.  Which then leads to the last major issue. Last time I tried to get IPv4 allocations it was like pulling teeth. Basically it turns out the we are out of available IPv4 addresses in North America. This means that getting IPs has become harder (though not impossible by any means.) In order to get the IP addresses that you will need for a deployment like this you will have to jump through hoops, or work a deal with one of the class A providers from way-way- back. The problem is that nobody wants to give IPs away, and the large services that are hanging on to them see them as an asset, so wrangling them away has become a contract issue. Expect to pay at least a few thousand if you want to get a decent sized block of IPs. Of course IPv6 solves this issue, but you pretty much can't exist on the internet as an ISP with only IPv6 addresses. =/"

After you turn it in to BPD there's a 30 or 90 period and if no one claims it then it's yours.

Boise,2pe5ul,encephlavator,6,Mon Dec 15 21:14:57 2014 UTC,"Bronco Billy was primarily filmed in the Meridian Speedway for all of the circus scenes, the bank robbery scene and a few other scenes. Other locations were the VA hospital, Old Penitentiary, Lake Lowell and the Old Nampa City Hall where the new library is being built. Also, the scene with the sheriff chewing out Bronco Billy was filmed in the ""old jail"" in the City Hall. The bar scenes were filmed in Eagle at the bar on the west of town with the rock face on it.     Other true trivia:  Varney Air Lines predecessor to United Airlines started in Boise in 1926 as did Varney Speed Service (1934) predecessor to Continental Airlines now United Continental.  The runway of the original Boise airport lies on the campus of Boise State University. It's the sidewalk that runs between Riverfront Hall and the Admin building.   Congregation Ahavath Beth Israel Synagogue is the oldest building in continuous use as a Synagogue in the United States west of the Mississippi.   Actress Maureen O'Hara lives in Boise  The Terteling Company, the largest agricultural and construction equipment company (Agri-Service and Western States Equip) is HQ in Boise. They also own the ground on which Mt. Home Air Force Base is built upon. If the base closes The Terteling Company retains ownership much like the Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey and the former Cole Elementary school.   Boise Ave. Follows the route of the old Oregon trail as it wandered through the area. From the point of Valley entry near Bonneville Point through the cliffs on the east to its terminus near Capitol Blvd. The pioneers originally camped on flat ground that today makes up the Boise State Campus. A northern route follows Warm Springs Ave. These two routes merge back to one route in Parma at the Hudson Bay Fort Boise.  The ground that makes up Military Reserve, Fort Boise and the VA Medical Center belongs to the City of Boise.   The original route to Idaho City is along Reserve St., Shaw Mountain Rd. and finally Rocky Canyon Rd. Now the route of ""Race to Robbie Creek""  There is an abandoned Military Cemetery on Mountain Cove Rd. behind the VA Hospital. Internments date to the Civil War."

As soon as I moved it out of the basement and into our livingroom/behind my TV, I can't really connect for shit.

Boise,2p8lxb,rragnaar,1 point,Sun Dec 14 05:54:56 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I have very inconsistent results on the PS4 network speed test utility that range from 1mb/s to 20mb/s within one minute of each other. I never had that problem with the Centurylink hardware. When I look at the ""network status"" option in the PS4 settings, it says I have 100% signal but the performance indicates otherwise.  For what it's worth, when I've had it wired via ethernet in the room with the modem in it, the speed is great. That's what makes me think it's a problem with the Cableone modem. I just can't take it to any other rooms without the performance going to shit."

Boise,2p8lxb,Justbetterton,2,Mon Dec 15 18:18:29 2014 UTC,I had cable one and the speeds were consistent before I went to the 50mps after I made the switch to 50mps it was all over the place.  But to help you with your issue.  I know there is some sort of device that you plug into a outlet that will send the internet signal through the electric sockets.  According to my Friend (who has and ps4 and cable one) he has this and it works as a wired connection. Which helped the ping.  I will try to find out wtf it is called and post a link  Edit:  Hey I found it look for a Powerline Network Adapter Kits.  Here's a link to get an idea on pricing.

Boise,2p8lxb,too_much_to_do,1 point,Sun Dec 14 07:41:19 2014 UTC,"If you've verified that your wired connection to your PS4 works well with the Cable One connection, then it's one of two things:  1) Your wireless settings need modification. You might need to try channel 1, 6, or 11 (use only those channels). Those are the three main channels you should be using, so see if a neighbor is on any of those and switch one they're not. If they're on all three, pick the one that is the weakest.  2) Your modem-router needs replacement, so replace the modem-router and/or buy a wireless router. You may have a shit router or the model they gave you has a shitty antenna.   Your DNS shouldn't have anything to do with this because DNS is for resolving domain names to IP addresses (which is at a different layer of networking). Your issues are a different networking layer, closer to the physical than software because they're issues relating to the performance of packets getting to and from your router.  If you can't rewire things, then invest in a good wireless router."
Boise,2p8lxb,zetswei,1 point,Sun Dec 14 09:06:22 2014 UTC,"Yep, tried all three of those channels, as well as just putting it on ""auto"". No change. I have neighbors all around me on all three of those channels so that might be causing some interference but it didn't seem to affect my previous modem/router. It's definitely not a port issue because I've ran it on DMZ with no change either.  I'm leaning more toward getting a different router. Cableone won't replace mine (nor do I think it'd make much of a difference) because wifi service degradation is ""expected"".

I worked geek squad for years and have the connection for years, and cableone Ping is the fastest hands down, with ping never over 17 when I play.   It's most likely the distance and the saturation of wireless in your area causing problems.   Try a powerline network kit.   They sell them at best buy for around 50 bucks.   Uses your power outlet to run a network cable.   Don't use a power strip with it, good luck"
Boise,2p8lxb,iflanzy,-1,Sun Dec 14 19:12:11 2014 UTC,Why can't you just buy a longer ethernet cable and see what happens?

When I'm at my parents house over the summer, I have it going out of my room door, across a hallway, drop it under the banister so it goes down the stairs, then across the entry way, through another door into the office room, then connected to the router.   It's worth doing something like that if you actually want to use your 50mb/s."
Boise,2p8lxb,iflanzy,1 point,Sun Dec 14 06:13:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I get that. It's really more of a convenience thing because running a 50 foot cable from my living room to bedroom is unsightly and annoying.   My main point here is that the Centurylink modem was in the same exact room and performed fine. I don't understand why the Cableone modem isn't able to do the same. Maybe I should try getting an extender router?"

Occasionally the PS4 can't even connect to the network, despite being only 20 feet away from point to point.   I also gave the PS4 a static IP and opened DMZ on it but it didn't seem to help either so I'm at a loss."

Especially if you are going to have public access to those areas.  Stories I've heard about other older (and more liberal) cities like Madison, WI where you get grandfathered in and aren't required to do expensive (and space using) ADA modifications to your shop just because you are doing a separate small remodel. Whereas in Boise you are required to completely update and comply with current standards.  I'm not arguing that this is wrong, and my evidence is anecdotal, but it still makes me question the survey results.   /edit: oh, and although ADA is a federal law, its enforced locally."

What's the last coal disaster you can recall?  I can only think of the one where the slurry pond broke and flooded a small town with toxic sludge - but I can't name the town.  Coal, like cigarettes, does its damage slowly and incessantly, which is harder for humans to notice.  I can't recall it, but there's a term for the kind of cognitive bias where people over-estimate the occurrence rates of things they hear about.  It doesn't matter that Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima were probably 3 completely different designs that failed in 3 different catastrophic ways, they were ""nuclear"" plants that caused a lot of damage and did so very sensationally.  Edit:  the name for the bias is ""Availability Heuristic"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic).

Boise,2ow2q8,ebilgenius,8,Wed Dec 10 22:34:49 2014 UTC,It's to protest the police-related deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.  Also to highlight the rate of disproportional number of arrests and resulting incarceration of minorities.

Boise,2ow2q8,atravisty,2,Thu Dec 11 16:12:03 2014 UTC,"Could it be that minorities commit a disproportional number of crimes therefore amounting to a disproportional number of arrests? Just speculating. See, the thing about science, even the social sciences, is that researchers must do their homework."
Boise,2ow2q8,TuffAdams,7,Wed Dec 10 22:13:38 2014 UTC,"Could it be that minorities commit a disproportionate number of crimes because institutional racism leaves many minorities in low income situations where crime is a legitimate option? Na, they're probably just inferior.   Also, if researchers are not doing their homework, then can they rightfully be called researchers?"
Boise,2ow2q8,LobsterLoo,0,Thu Dec 11 04:27:44 2014 UTC,"Or...could it be a culture of violence perpetuated by their choice of music and entertainment? There is a black man in the White House now so the time for excuses has passed. I find it amusing that anyone from Boise would claim to have experience in this matter. You can go all day in Boise and not see a black person. I am from Atlanta, AKA the Chocolate City, and I saw it every day. It is a culture of violence, non- cooperation with authority, and a welfare mentality that has been stamped on their brains by race pimps like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. They have nobody to blame but themselves."
Boise,2ow2q8,atravisty,-1,Thu Dec 11 12:50:15 2014 UTC,"You say that as if there are no poor white people.

Boise,2ow2q8,supinterwebs,1 point,Thu Dec 11 22:47:02 2014 UTC,"Assuming that statistic is true, you're only hurting your case/making my point. If someone is not in jail it does not necessarily mean that they did not commit a crime. Just like if someone is in jail doesn't necessarily mean that they did commit a crime....which is essentially what these protests are trying to raise awareness about.  I'll bet there are some good arguments out there to help your point, maybe you should do your homework."

Boise,2ow2q8,BigScien,4,Thu Dec 11 02:38:18 2014 UTC,Ahhh...I remember being in college and knowing every fucking thing. They should probably spend some time reading the grand jury report on the Michael Brown shooting and less time on twitter so they would actually know some FACTS instead of mindless tweets. I swear to God that these asshats piss me off.
Boise,2ow2q8,TuffAdams,4,Wed Dec 10 21:55:54 2014 UTC,"Really, you're the same as these people. You are buying in to media hype with your name calling and assumptions about facts. I promise you haven't read all of the grand jury reports, and furthermore would bet a sizable sum that you don't have the appropriate education to interpret it even if you did get through the literally thousands of pages. I don't mean that as an insult, it's just that your statement doesn't seem like it was written by a lawyer. I would bet less money that I already know your position on the Eric Garner case too. Try to put less emotion into something that doesn't effect you directly. You can be objective and still hold the same view of the case, but being objective means you know how little your opinion on any one particular case matters.   Let me restate this to prevent any misinterpretation, I am not saying you are wrong, I am saying that you are being emotional and it clouds your judgement."
Boise,2ow2q8,sucka_puncha,7,Thu Dec 11 01:27:26 2014 UTC,"Not being emotional at all. I read every last word of the grand jury report on the Michael brown case. The facts were crystal clear. Did he deserve to die? Absolutely not but he took that decision out of the officers hand and forced the officer to shoot him. To defend that man is a slap in the face to any law enforcement officer.  As for the Garner case, what led to his death wasn't the choke hold. It was his pre existing medical conditions. Could his death have been avoided? Absolutely. All he had to do was comply with the officers orders. Easy enough. He had a rap sheet as long as my leg. He was a known criminal. This wasn't his first encounter with the police. He had over 30 such encounters therefore he was very familiar with what was expected of him. The coroners report, if you care to read it, was explicit in that he died because he was morbidly obese and had a heart condition. None of these were the polices fault.   In BOTH CASES, had the criminals complied with the orders of the officers they would both be alive today.   BTW...business degree from UGA and my MBA from Georgia State University. Not a lawyer but not an idiot."
Boise,2ow2q8,TuffAdams,3,Thu Dec 11 03:38:20 2014 UTC,"Don't be all logical and stuff.  I read most of the Grand Jury report too.  After reading it, all I can do is laugh when I see those protestors.  As far as race issues.  If you want to be serious about talking race, don't tell me that I'm a racist simply for existing white and expect that I'm going to listen to anything you have to say."
Boise,2ow2q8,ABWebUS,3,Fri Dec 12 02:07:39 2014 UTC,"Right. I have no issues at all with protestors who are protesting from with a basis in fact, but these are two examples of police doing their jobs. Let's be real: if the two criminals who died were white, we would not be having this discussion."
Boise,2ow2q8,JadedDarkness,1 point,Fri Dec 12 16:17:36 2014 UTC,"I haven't read the Grand Jury reports either, but I do understand that their creation was part of our nation's judicial process to see who was culpable for the incidents. (And I certainly know that the people who prepared the reports had greater access to witnesses and evidence than college kids and internet slacktivists and their respective and highly-overlapping echo-chambers.)  So if the problem is that the judicial system is biased against blacks and/or in favor of police, that should be fixed. I seem to remember Obama's election was supposed to solve all race issues in America one way or another, so I guess I have to assume it's the latter. At any rate, if these kids want to see the judicial system changed or purged of corruption, I think there are more productive things they can do than lie on the pavement of a crowded walkway on a cold December day."
Boise,2ow2q8,ScottyStyles,1 point,Thu Dec 11 04:45:53 2014 UTC,"All this achieves is being in the way for us on campus. Honestly there are way better ways to do something about the police-related problems. I hate to be this guy, but they really are probably just looking for attention."
Boise,2ow2q8,JadedDarkness,8,Wed Dec 10 21:57:18 2014 UTC,"Well yes... That's what protests do.  If its out of sight, out of mind would you care at all?  Would it be anywhere close to a relevant thought on your mind?"
Boise,2ow2q8,TuffAdams,3,Wed Dec 10 21:59:14 2014 UTC,"Right, but how are you supposed to know what they are protesting when they are just laying on the ground? They don't have a message or anything."
Boise,2ow2q8,franran,0,Wed Dec 10 22:02:01 2014 UTC,"If you look at them they are holding pieces of paper.  On the papers were pictures of the black kids that were murdered by police officers. There was also signs saying ""I can't breath"" which is how one of them was murdered, a choke hold. The idea is to spread awareness through non-violent actions to spur change. It's similar to sit-ins popular during the civil rights movement."
Boise,2ow2q8,justjustjust,2,Thu Dec 11 03:27:24 2014 UTC,"Garner wasn't murdered. The choke hold didn't kill him. Read the coroners report. He had a heart issue and he was morbidly obese. His fat ass resisted arrest, over 30 arrests he has resisted. Had he complied with the officers orders he would be alive today. Same story with Michael Brown."
Boise,2ow2q8,squarl,2,Thu Dec 11 03:43:41 2014 UTC,I love how they had to tape off the area on either side of them to avoid people walking right over them.  The only difference between this and the aftermath of an epic party is everyone is lying down in an orderly fashion.

Boise,2ow2q8,pinkuspie77,7,Thu Dec 11 03:55:52 2014 UTC,"no the fact that they are doing this just for recent ""injustices"" is the depressing thing, this protest sucks balls. If they really really want to get into it why not do a fucking google search and read up a little on all the unjustified killings by officers and fucking print off each story and stand in protest with all the stories and pictures of the victims.   But naw man lets just protest the bullshit we see on tiwtterface because you know thats all that really matters.   This protest is slacking and shamefull, it literally does nothing but give these nonchalant turds a small reason to give their ego's a chubby and make themselves feel good. The worst part is this is the only time there ever going to do anything like this and just go along and forget that anything ever happened. just like they forgot about Emmett Till, or the kent state victims, or fuck they probably forgot about George Stinney, shit they probably don't even know who that is..."

Camels Back can be reached by bus #14 to the Hyde Park District which has a few restaurants. I recommend Parrilla Grill for the budget conscious.  Bus route info: http://www.valleyride.org/bus-services/boise-routes/  Boise hiking trails map: http://www.ridgetorivers.org/trails/interactive-map/  For Boise Greenbelt and bike trails, just use google maps.

In 2011 we were top 10 the entire season with the only loss being top 25 TCU and we went on to dismantle ASU in the Vegas Bowl. Even in 2012 with Southwick we went 11-2 and were in the top 25 most of the season."

Boise,2on5ns,BoiseModerator,2,Mon Dec 8 13:06:14 2014 UTC,"It has been requested to implement an ""Events"" sticky post or an ""Events"" link on the sidebar. What does /r/boise think? Any links to good implementations?  Please note: Reddit only allows one sticky post at the top. Some mobile users complain of not seeing a sidebar.  Here's two examples:  /r/Portland has a sidebar hover over feature which pops up a few event listings.   /r/Denver has a creative solution. Denver's sidebar links to a user account which is dedicated to weekly event listings. See rDenverPosts. It's somewhat confusing, but a weekly ""events"" submission goes into the main /r/denver queue. The sidebar link acts like a filter directing users to the events threads only. This helps counter the fact that the ""events"" submission gets buried by new submissions. Con: It takes 2 clicks to get to. Pro: Any user can leave comments to each ""event"" submission so no single user is burdened with the task."

Boise,2on5ns,staintrain,2,Tue Dec 9 18:51:10 2014 UTC,I have a question. What do you think off all the growler beer fill stations popping up? Fad or maybe Boise is getting of the national beer map.
Boise,2on5ns,rragnaar,5,Wed Dec 10 07:01:10 2014 UTC,"I love having beer straight from the tap, but I feel like the prices need a bit of an adjustment.  A growler fill typically costs more than a six pack and has less beer.  Other than that, I'm happy to see the Boise beer scene keep on growing."
Boise,2on5ns,Sterling_____Archer,5,Wed Dec 10 17:42:03 2014 UTC,"Massive fad. It's not really ""cool"" if you can buy beer in a growler, in a gas station.   Lame."
Boise,2on5ns,caseyoc,2,Fri Dec 12 18:54:09 2014 UTC,"I love it.  The tricky part is remembering to take a growler with me when I head to the grocery store--first it was remembering the reusable bags, now it's the growler.  Hipster problems?"
Boise,2on5ns,daashm,1 point,Fri Dec 12 15:20:38 2014 UTC,"I like having the option, and it's great when there are beers available that aren't canned or bottled. But, as /u/rragnaar said, it is a bit silly when the beer is significantly more expensive out of a growler. (I get that beer can be better straight from a tap, but it's also more impractical to have to drink five beers in one sitting.) Also, I think it's great/ridiculous that, at least as of Saturday, you can get a growler fill of PBR at Winco for $4. Thanks Winco!"
Boise,2on5ns,crazyk4952,1 point,Thu Dec 11 15:55:06 2014 UTC,I was just at the Fred Meyer on Franklin and they had an employee just standing by the growler filling station there. Nobody was getting their growler filled despite the fact that the store was packed with customers.

Boise,2on5ns,daashm,1 point,Wed Dec 10 23:09:41 2014 UTC,"Payette or Sockeye's cans are probably your best bet for shipping and bang-for-your-buck. If they're super beer nerd (and like all that farmhouse stuff that's apparently all the rage in Vermont) you might want to get a nice larger bottle from Grand Teton (they brew in Victor) or Selkirk Abbey (from Post Falls). One option, though it's less local, is to get a good west coast beer that isn't distributed in Vermont. It'll set you back ~$15, but you can probably find a bottle of The Abyss by Deschutes. Or, Sculpin out of San Diego's probably a bit cheaper. If you want some sort of beer nerd consensus on a beer, check out Beergraphs: http://www.beergraphs.com/leaderboards/  Those jerks don't like Mutton Buster, though, so don't treat those stats as gospel."

Boise,2on5ns,BoiseModerator,2,Mon Dec 8 18:51:35 2014 UTC,"Below are points considered and researched in creating a dedicated Weekly Q&A thread.   1) A little history: Askreddit was one of the first subreddits split off from reddit, and it's important to note that it was done by the admins. Not long after that, /r/science spun off AskScience. Yes, those are much bigger subs but that's belaboring the point.  2) It's impossible to prove but there's good evidence that trolls were asking inane or redundant questions just to be disruptive and/or flood the forum.   3) There was good evidence that two-stage spamming was occurring. That is, people creating accounts months or years in advance, populating those accounts with a few submissions and comments only to use them at some later point in a veiled free advertising stunt.   4) Other city subs are grappling with the same issue, for example:   Portland: see this thread, from Sept 29, 2014 Portland: a sort of followup, from Nov 19, 2014 /r/SaltLakecity: First rule on the side bar: ""Please use search before posting."" /r/SaltLakecity: Fourth rule on the side bar: ""Do some basic research before posting a question. We are not your personal search engine nor a source of legal advice. Questions asked without some proof of research will be removed."" /r/Denver: On the sidebar: ""Read the FAQ and search the archives before posting. This is especially important if you're posting about moving, visiting, and dining."" /r/Seattle: Fifth rule on the sidebar: ""Please do your due diligence before posting questions to the community: Search Google and our FAQs (see below) first and tell us what you have found in your post."" /r/DesMoines: Sticked post  /r/SanDiego: Active /r/askSanDiego, curious lack of questions in /r/SanDiego there's more..."

Even if the cop is racist, you'd have to be retarded to shoot a black guy in St. Louis unless you have a damn good reason.   Cops are not always right. But they are human, and this Brown guy was huge and after seeing him man handle the convenience store clerk, it doesn't seem to much of a stretch that he went after a cop. He was unarmed but could have had a shank or something on him, and then whipped it out when he got close to the cop.   When does a cop get to protect himself? When he has a knife wound in his neck?  I was all for supporting the Treyvon Martin case. But this case is completely different.   I'm a small dude and Officer Wilson doesn't look all that big. If I had someone I know is violent, (he robbed a convenience store, he wasn't out spreading the word of God) and he is coming after me, I'd shoot his ass too. Count me out of this protest."
Boise,2nk5xy,dodadoBoxcarWilly,3,Sat Nov 29 17:41:46 2014 UTC,Can we organize a protest to show support for Officer Wilson? He's the real victim. Maybe we can raise funds for the people who lost their businesses to the savages.

Boise,2nk5xy,mbleslie,9,Thu Nov 27 08:31:16 2014 UTC,"Why rally behind the idiot Michael Brown though? He clearly provoked the attack, according to the grand jury proceedings"
Boise,2nk5xy,janicuda,-3,Fri Nov 28 23:00:40 2014 UTC,"There are some questions on whether the prosecutor for the grand jury actually acted as a prosecutor. For instance, grand juries never hear about any evidence that would be provided in the Defendant's defense. Apparently the jury in this matter did. http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/use-grand-jury"
Boise,2nk5xy,sucka_puncha,6,Fri Nov 28 23:06:47 2014 UTC,So you're basically saying they presented all the evidence to the Grand Jury including all of the evidence you don't like and would prefer that nobody hear. All the evidence that would have caused the cop to be acquited at a trial.
Boise,2nk5xy,janicuda,3,Sat Nov 29 14:47:14 2014 UTC,"That's not what grand juries are for. And if they presented exculpatory evidence here, and not in the thousands of other federal grand juries, then that's an issue of justice and equal protection."
Boise,2nk5xy,huehuehueRon,-4,Sat Nov 29 18:24:54 2014 UTC,"Not to mention it is not an officers job to play judge jury and executioner. No matter if he was guilty or innocent, we are all innocent until proven guilty. A petit theft does not warrant being murdered. Only barbaric terrorists are okay with that. That's what they do in Iran and in dictatorships. Here in America we are innocent until proven guilty, and even still death is not a punishment for even FELONY ROBBERY. Mike Brown would of been charged with Petit Theft if he were to be charged correctly, but people of color tend to get the book thrown at them and charged with the worst crime they can.  Officer Wilson testified that he was hit two times. He already has contradicted his testimony by stating during his first media interview, that was hit at least once but lost count . His injuries also don't match up. He played up the threat Mike Brown posed by saying he was a huge beast that was much bigger than him and was hitting him with such force that he was scared of losing his life, yet he was left with only bruises, and only 2 that are perfectly fist shaped? That doesn't add up.   The grand jury proceedings were a charade, they never planned on indicting him. The prosecutor helped Darren Wilson get off. One of the prosecutors used an outdated law that was struck down in 1985 as being unconstitutional. The Missouri law stated that it was lawful for a police officer to use any force necessary to stop a fleeing suspect, up to lethal force. The law was struck down because it was found to be unconstitutional violating the 5th, 6th, and 14th amendments under ""Innocent Until Proven Guilty"". A suspect has not been found guilty and has the constitutional right to have his guilt proven in front of his peers before being punished. But yet the prosecutor presented it to the grand jury as if the law that was struck down 20 years ago, was still in effect & lawful. She later tried protecting herself by saying “That does correctly state what the law is on when an officer can use force and when he can use Deadly Force in affecting an arrest, okay. I don’t want you to get confused and don’t rely on that copy or that print-out of the statute that I've given you a long time ago. It is not entirely incorrect or inaccurate, but there is something in it that’s not correct, ignore it totally” She didn't elaborate on what was incorrect. Why is the prosecution helping a defendant? Especially with a law ruled unconstitutional?  Officer Wilson's injuries do not match up with his claims. He states he was punched so hard he feared losing consciousness or even dying. Yet he suffered no broken bones or bruised bones in his face. He claims to of been hit (depending on which account [oh yay contradiction]): Interview w/ detective After Incident: twice Grand Jury: twice Interview With Media: At least once but lost count..... How did it go from a firm two in both first interview and testimony to a one and lost count? Not to mention his supervisor told him to drive himself alone in his supervisors car back to the police station. It is possible he inflicted the wounds himself. In the photo's you see fresh abrasion on the back of his head, but in none of his stories does he mention how those occurred.. This whole thing stinks of fishiness. He should of never been left alone and should of been escorted.  Officer Wilson's Grand Jury Testimony (Page 210 his description of the incident begins): http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/darren-wilson-testimony/html_a1503f45-af27-588e-8b1c-a26f83096ef0.html#annotation/a190193   Officer Wilson's Interview with Detective Right After Incident, He only described being hit twice, then a struggle: http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1370884-interview-po-darren-wilson.html  First Media Interview after Grand Jury Indictment with ABCNews. He now doesnt know how many times he was punched, he knows atleast once, which contradicts his firm 2.... : http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/exclusive-watch-george-stephanopoulos-full-interview-police-officer-27186831  Prosecutor using law deemed unconstitutional: http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/darren-wilson-testimony/html_a1503f45-af27-588e-8b1c-a26f83096ef0.html  info on that law, what it says:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_Force_Doctrine_in_Missouri  Heres his injuries: http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/24/7279311/ferguson-darren-wilson-injuries injuries plus medical reports: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2853426/Darren-Wilson-s-medical-records-reveal-showed-no-apparent-distress-little-physical-injury-just-hours-shooting-Michael-Brown-despite-claiming-feared-teenager-kill-him.html  I am sorry, but those pictures don't show evidence of a reason to fear for ones life. At one point someone (it was rumored to be friends of Officer Wilson or the Ferguson PD) leaked info stating Officer Wilson suffered a broken eye socket and a broken nose. Then it so happens that they don't reveal the true extent of his injuries until after the Grand Jury, because they knew people will go ""well, there wasn't evidence that he did anything wrong, he was scared and did his job. Justice has been served"".   So with all the evidence in front of you, you can now make an educated statement. If you still think justice was served, you are fooling yourself."
Boise,2nk5xy,huehuehueRon,1 point,Sun Nov 30 10:13:49 2014 UTC,"While some witnesses are asked tough questions about their stories, prosecutors are deferential with Wilson, asking, “Is there something that we have not asked you that you want us to know or you think is important for the jurors to consider regarding this incident?”  Kuby said, “That degree of politeness and solicitude to the target of an investigation never happens. Officer Wilson . . . was treated with kid gloves. The witnesses who supported his testimony were not contradicted, and those who didn’t were attacked, criticized and ridiculed. That’s how you steer a grand jury.”"

However, as I understand it, that structure was an upgrade and provides for ILS Category 3 approaches-- pretty much state of the art. Inversions, prior to the upgrade sometimes shut down operations for many hours if not days. They resorted to cloud seeding to clear the fog. In theory, the upgraded system makes inversion fog a non factor now. I can't recall the last time the airport was shut down due to fog.

I'm looking for something in outdoor adventure/tourism/travel/recreation/marketing. I've checked most of the government sites and haven't found anything. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Boise,2n9d8n,scienceismyjam,3,Mon Nov 24 23:26:34 2014 UTC,"You could look at sites like Indeed, or search around on private business websites in the Treasure Valley. Boise is a pretty competitive place to get a job because people like/want to live here, so you might have to start smaller than you'd like. Also if you want to to do outdoor stuff, tailor it to the season. Some suggestions: Bogus Basin, indoor climbing gyms, Boise Parks and Rec, local outdoor sports shops like Benchmark, McU's, Greenwoods Ski Haus, Southwest Idaho RC&D. That's all I can think of right now, good luck!"

Would want to ask what should I expect for the weather to be? I've never get to experience winter in my all year round summer country and have never gone to winter countries before. I don't exactly know what to expect, any tips on how to prepare for the winter season?  Also, I heard from my friends that Bogus Basin doesn't open until snowfall is high enough, and I'm hoping I can get to experience skiing when I'm there! Anyway I can know when it would be open?"
Boise,2n9d8n,JimMcKeeth,2,Wed Nov 26 02:27:18 2014 UTC,"Winter: Boise isn't generally terribly cold (as we are just ending a few weeks of not breaking freezing). Check a weather report for when you are planning to travel.  The best way to dress warm is layers, especially on your torso. A few thin layers are cheaper and easier to add and remove as necessary. Generally as you get active you warm up, and if you only have a thick coat then you have no flexibility.   Of course a lot of it depends on what you plan to do. Just getting to work is a much different experience than playing in the snow. In the latter then you will want to make sure you have good water proof outer shell.   I like to get a really nice thin pair of gloves for general use, and then wear a thicker pair over them when I am in the snow. You can even get thin gloves that you can use with your touch screen. Then I never have to completely remove my gloves.  If you can get a balaclava, they are great (like a thin ski mask) because they are so flexible at keeping your head, face and neck warm.  Snow boots are great if you are planning to hike through deep snow in the mountains, but they are a pain if you are just walking around town.  Skiing: There are a lot of places to Ski near Boise. Bogus is just the closest. It depends on when you plan to visit. Bogusbasin.org says they are generally opened mid November, but we just had a warm snap and there is no snow. You can check their site to see if they have snow:  Snow Report http://www.bogusbasin.org/snow-report.aspx  General Info http://www.bogusbasin.org/media-and-events/general-info.aspx WINTER: Bogus Basin is open for full winter operation mid-November through mid-April from 10am-10pm weekdays/9am-10pm weekends and holidays, depending on weather and conditions. Early and late season hours can change, so please check the snow report page or call 208-342-2100 for daily reports.

Another quick question, any tips / recommendation for grabbing taxis over there? Sadly I'm not able to drive and I would have to rely on taxi's to travel around. Is there anything I need to know? Is it easy to grab one along the roads or do I need to call everytime?"
Boise,2n9d8n,likufanele,1 point,Mon Nov 24 19:18:07 2014 UTC,If you're in the downtown area or at the airport there are usually plenty of taxis you can hop into. Anywhere else you will need to call for a pickup. Uber also launched in Boise recently.
Boise,2n9d8n,JimMcKeeth,1 point,Tue Nov 25 16:04:51 2014 UTC,"The airport has taxis regularly, and you occasionally can get them downtown some places, but you might plan on calling most of the time (depends where you are).

Boise,2mvwvn,Sterling_____Archer,1 point,Fri Nov 21 15:34:38 2014 UTC,The city doesn't have the resources. I would think Valleyride would want to make sure their stops are clear because it's good for business.
Boise,2mvwvn,learningbrain,1 point,Wed Nov 26 18:48:08 2014 UTC,Found my own answer. Apparently you have to complain to the city to get sidewalks shoveled.
Boise,2mvwvn,encephlavator,5,Fri Nov 21 06:46:33 2014 UTC,"Sadly, Boise's code enforcement office has been cut to the bone. (source: insider) It takes as much as a month or two for the few code officers they have to get around to any code complaint.   The way it works is like a fix-it ticket. An offender has 30 days to mitigate a code complaint. Only after 30 days can they be cited. Savvy business owners and homeowners know all they have to do is wait until the snow melts. And nothing at all will happen if no one complains. Code enforcement is citizen complaint generated only. IOW, code officers do not go around looking for violations to write up.  And if it did come down to a court summons the code officer would have to prove the snow/ice was the same snow/ice that was there the entire 30 days.  The ordinance was apparently written in 1927 and probably needs to be updated."
Boise,2mvwvn,darkstar999,0,Fri Nov 21 13:17:20 2014 UTC,"It would be ironically hilarious if the City started handing out tickets for this, meanwhile the streets are still ice."
Boise,2mvwvn,pleen,3,Fri Nov 21 15:39:03 2014 UTC,Isn't it the responsibility of the property owner where the sidewalk is to shovel? Thought I heard that everybody was supposed to be shoveling their own sidewalks whether in front of a house or a business.

Instead of spending insane sums on iPads, teach kids programming or Linux or Excel/Spreadsheet formulas- ANY valuable skills that people think of when they think ""technology in the classroom"".   If a person needed educating on how to use an iPad, Apple wouldn't claim that two year olds could use them. So what value do these fabled devices provide?

We got a December snowstorm around the holidays and an inversion set in for the next 3-4 weeks with 10 degree highs.

Boise,2mlke6,Sterling_____Archer,7,Tue Nov 18 16:07:01 2014 UTC,I read an article on KBOI (which I can no longer find) stating that Ada County Highway District feels as if we RARELY get enough snow to justify plowing the roads. I found this directly from ACHD: https://www.achdidaho.org/Departments/PR/RoadWizard/Entries.aspx?MID=20
Boise,2mlke6,encephlavator,3,Tue Nov 18 19:12:00 2014 UTC,"Still, with 23 plows, I want to see them out there at least making an effort when it's this bad.   Also, they wouldn't have had this problem (snow melting and then re-freezing into ice) if they were plowed quickly the first time."

A 6 to 8 inch single storm snowfall is quite rare in Boise and the surface treatment just can't melt it all, especially with these deep freeze temps.  Anyway, ACHD doesn't own many plows for the same reason few in Boise own a snow blower, or even a snow shovel for that matter.   And now that the stuff is packed down and frozen solid a plow wouldn't do much good anyway."

Boise,2mlke6,Oldschool64bus,4,Tue Nov 18 14:54:43 2014 UTC,"Happy cake day!!  Honestly, at this point it's probably too late to do much plowing... The trouble spots are where you have blocks of ice a few inches thick covering the road, and I can't imagine plowing that up is easier, or good for the roads.   That said, I wish they'd do something. There's portions of State St that just suck to drive over because of that ice... you have ruts literally worn into the ice, and you better follow those ruts to stay in lane, though you'll still be sliding all over."
Boise,2mlke6,JJHall_ID,3,Tue Nov 18 15:55:14 2014 UTC,"Agreed - it is too late now... and while this is an extremely rare occurrence, does that remove the need to clear the major surface streets for safe travel? The ice ruts that have formed now due to the ice melt application and re-freezing are a total safety hazard above and beyond being prepared for winter driving (studded snow tires). Do we need to chain up for city driving? There are plenty of contractors making bank on this with their equipment, and ACHD says outright they depend on private contractors. Maybe hold off on the next fleet of brand new trucks for a month to pay for some diesel fuel for some snow clearing equipment. Last I knew ACHD owns and maintains a fair fleet of heavy equipment (ie: front end-loaders, backhoes, road graders, etc...) that could make some quick work of this mess..."
Boise,2mlke6,Xgamer4,5,Mon Nov 17 22:33:48 2014 UTC,"One of the main problems is having the equipment to get to it all.  There just simply isn't enough for all roads.  Most of the frozen ice ruts are because the snow was packed down in the tracks, but not elsewhere (because the plows didn't get there in time) and then the freezing temps made that freeze over making the blades useless.  The major problem is we just don't get enough snow each year to constitute the need for more equipment that can get to the roads quickly enough and safely (remember some of those heavy equipment run really slow and are a road hazard in 35mph zones).  The ACHD only has so much in their budget to do these things."
Boise,2mlke6,therealScarzilla,1 point,Mon Nov 17 22:43:51 2014 UTC,"ACHD Source  ""ACHD does not specifically budget a large amount of funds for snow removal... When we have severe weather and have to hire contractors, we adjust our budget at mid-year (in April) to cover the additional costs. The budgeted funds that are spent in the summer such as asphalt mix, gravel, liquid asphalt, and others are reduced accordingly.""  IMO This would have been a fantastic time to ""hire contractors"" to assist in the removal given that this last event was generally considered an extreme/abnormal condition."

Boise,2mlke6,too_much_to_do,12,Thu Nov 20 03:28:28 2014 UTC,I'd imagine it's the Boise River that's the main worry - not rust.

Boise,2mlke6,ubermiguel,6,Tue Nov 18 03:43:40 2014 UTC,"the boise river used to be one of the worst in the nation, that's why so many people are rather careful about it.  it took DECADES to get it this clean.  like keeping your body in shape, it's easier to maintain than to screw it up, THEN try to fix it."
Boise,2mlke6,smokey_sunrise,6,Tue Nov 18 04:38:53 2014 UTC,"Or... Just slow down a little and the roads aren't nearly as dangerous.  As I said, this level of snowfall is very unusual for the Treasure Valley.  If we had this level every year then it may be worth it to invest in the equipment necessary to quickly clear the roads.  Since we don't, it isn't, so we get to deal with it for a few weeks on the rare years when it happens.  If we spent the money, everyone would be complaining about the outrageous expense to beef up for the rare conditions.  On top of that, the equipment would sit idle for several years at a time.  It is harder on equipment to sit idle than to be in regular use as seals aren't flexed, oil drains away from parts it protects, etc.  So now we spent a crap load of money on equipment that is likely to fail before it's even been used more than 2-3 times at the most.  To me it seems the obvious choice is the one that has been made.  And you're right, the rust is the least of the concern with salt.  More important is the damage to the watersheds and plant life.  Nearly all of our storm drain systems dump directly into the Boise/Snake rivers and their tributary streams.  That salt is bad for everything from the plants up through the fish and beyond.  If you don't believe that, start adding a tablespoon of salt to your house plants every time you water them and take a look at the results for yourself.  Those sorts of things are very important to us native Idahoans.  More so than needing to leave a half hour earlier to get across town.  From your comments I kind of gather you aren't too happy living here.  My sincere suggestion is if you like Detroit so much better, just move back.  I can't understand why people move to an area then start to complain about how much better it was ""back home.""  It is a lot easier to move somewhere that already fits your ideal image than to move somewhere that isn't and expect everyone to change to meet your needs.  ""Home is where your heart is"" as the saying goes."

Both were going considerably slower than the speed limit. It's the monster speed bump of ice in between the lanes that's the problem.   Speaking of getting salty, it seems as like too many idahoans get super defensive if anyone points out something less than ideal."

Sunday and Monday and it looks like Tuesday will all be record lows.   Normally, you could have had no snow or ice on the greenbelt until January and then when it came it would have lasted only a couple weeks until it was gone again unless an inversion set it immediately after a snow storm, then it might be a month.

The lack of return was due to issues with arena amenities and the 2018 announcement likely means some renovations will occur in the next couple of years.

The road going towards the mountains in the middle of the picture is Central Avenue. The main road going East/West at the top is I-10, the one on the bottom is Mission Blvd. The one in the middle going under the curved bridge are actually train tracks.

Boise,2ma1zz,likufanele,2,Fri Nov 14 13:44:42 2014 UTC,BSU's tendency to not close due to weather is primarily because many of the students live on campus and are not affected by road conditions.
Boise,2ma1zz,willsueforfood,3,Fri Nov 14 15:29:05 2014 UTC,Boise State is just extremely incompetent when it comes to weather. Last year when there was two inches of frozen rain on the roads they didn't close down and issued a statement only 45 minutes before classes started.

Not a single snowplow was out yesterday and it looks like they still haven't done anything with the roads around my house. I spent 2.5 hours traversing 8 miles on State street yesterday because only one inch of snow fell by that point. I've never seen Boise's roads so shitty before, even when it snowed 4-8 inches in the past. Someone really dropped the ball on maintaining them this year."
Boise,2ma1zz,tidwalli,7,Fri Nov 14 13:10:13 2014 UTC,"Since yesterday we've gotten more than double the average Boise November snowfall.   it's very unusual to have this kind of accumulation this early.  The odds of there being ANY snow on the ground on 11/14 in Boise is less than 5%.  The odds of there being this much on the ground at any point in November are far less than that.  That's going to strain local resources some.   The county worked overnight to cover the priority areas, but the more residential roads are going to take longer.   https://weatherspark.com/averages/29792/11/Boise-Idaho-United-States"
Boise,2ma1zz,encephlavator,1 point,Fri Nov 14 17:55:05 2014 UTC,"When I posted that there was still less than 3 inches of snowfall over the course of 24 hours and there still wasn't a single road plowed or de-iced. It's been a week and roads still aren't cleared. Federal way is a sheet of ice in the last 2 mile stretch before Micron. Downtown is covered in ice, especially Hays and Bogus Basin road. I've lived in Boise for 25 years and the roads have always been cleared within a day of the last snowfall. This is ridiculous."
Boise,2ma1zz,tidwalli,1 point,Thu Nov 20 14:26:49 2014 UTC,"I've lived in Boise for 25 years too. I recall seeing a single storm snowfall of more than 6 inches of snow only once. That was Christmas Day or Xmas Eve in 98 or 99. I challenge you to find a single storm snowfall total over 5"" or even 4"" in the last 25 years.   I saw the appeal-to-emotion news media comparing Boise to Spokane, Reno and SLC. Fact is Boise is not Spokane, Reno or SLC. The long term averages do not warrant ACHD buying, maintaining and using enough plow equipment to clear all 2600 miles of pavement every time it snows.   A very strong argument could be made that that money could be used for sidewalks, bike lanes and other amenities which, you know, would be useful for more than 1 or 2 days every 25 years.   Further reading: Cost Benefit Analysis: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost–benefit_analysis  And there's more: The 20º to 25º below average temps are extremely rare especially considering the length of the cold spell. It's yet another factor in the equation of cost benefit analysis which cannot be ignored.   I have some big issues with ACHD but snow removal is not one of them."
Boise,2ma1zz,encephlavator,1 point,Thu Nov 20 15:58:10 2014 UTC,"You're ignoring the part where I said there were only a few inches on the ground when I made my post. The point is that on Thursday last week ALL major roads were left untouched by road crews even though they had several days of warning to prepare for the snow. Many major roadways still have not been touched by plows, sand or deicer. This has never happened in the past. Judging by the other threads on the front page right now I am not the only person to make this observation. They really fucked up last week. Federal Way alone has probably done thousands of dollars in damages to the suspension and wheels on cars. It still hasn't been plowed or sanded btw. Several of Boise's biggest employers are on that road and the fucktard in charge of road maintenance has not put in any effort whatsoever to deal with the massive ruts, bumps and sheets of pure ice that are miles long a week after it last snowed."
Boise,2ma1zz,tidwalli,1 point,Thu Nov 20 19:45:27 2014 UTC,"I agree the conditions are awful. So what's exactly at play? Making sure this never happens again? Right?

Boise,2ma1zz,sunthas,1 point,Thu Nov 20 20:55:08 2014 UTC,Or they could get their shit together and handle the roads the same way they have done in years prior to this. You act like this is some kind of funding issue when really it just stems from gross incompetence.

Just for kicks, I looked it up on Idaho's exchange a few days ago. The exact same plan is now $100 more expensive - it went from $315/month to something like $425/month.   As my contract with the company was at the lower price, I think I'm safe, but I won't be completely sure until I need to renew it..."
Boise,2m3vjn,Xgamer4,1 point,Thu Nov 13 00:03:46 2014 UTC,"That's interesting. What county are you in, if you don't mind me asking?  I have a Blue Cross of Idaho Gold Choice plan, for a family of 3 in Ada County, and the price for the 3 of us is only going up about $50/mo from last year.  I wonder what could account for such a drastic increase in the price for your plan."
Boise,2m3vjn,igetkindahungry,1 point,Thu Nov 13 02:57:14 2014 UTC,"You have inspired me to do some digging, as I also have the Blue Cross Gold Choice plan, for a family of 2 in Ada County.   So this kinda suggests there's more going on here. Noteworthy changes to app in last year:   Everyone aged 1 year (most notably - my wife turned 21?) I received a $5k annual raise   Current exact cost: $323.86  New quoted cost: $428.90  Roll everyone's age back 1 year: $350.63  Prior Salary: $428.90  Both changes: $350.63  Current salary, only use wife's old age: $350.63  (Notable - prior salary leaves me eligible for a credit. This isn't counted, though, as my work offers health insurance that's just not crappy enough to count as valid health insurance, but still be a terrible deal for me)  So apparently it's actually my wife's fault for turning 21.   Oh well, our son's gonna be born in February and that'll screw with our premiums anyway... I'll figure it out."
Boise,2m3vjn,Xgamer4,1 point,Thu Nov 13 12:32:55 2014 UTC,"Well, they do increase their prices year over year. So the extra $26 or so is probably due to a combination of the age increase and the premiums price increase.  I'd have to look at last year's and this year's price sheets to be sure."
Boise,2m3vjn,igetkindahungry,1 point,Thu Nov 13 17:20:15 2014 UTC,The $26 I can understand and don't really have issues with. It's the $75 on top of that because my wife turned 21 that just seems kinda excessive.
Boise,2m3vjn,Xgamer4,1 point,Thu Nov 13 18:43:58 2014 UTC,"It's been a little while since I looked at it, but I seem to recall that the price sheets have a single price for people 20 and under, and then a separate price for every year from 21 up through 64. So, that would make sense to me that it's cheaper than the 21 price by more than, say, 21 differs from 22."
Boise,2m3vjn,igetkindahungry,1 point,Thu Nov 13 18:52:24 2014 UTC,Right... I'd forgotten about that. That would explain it
Boise,2m3vjn,Xgamer4,1 point,Thu Nov 13 19:38:19 2014 UTC,"Looking at my employer rate plan (outside the exchange, but all insurance rates will adjust the same now based on age since that's how the law was written) 20 and under is 1 price, then 21 -24.  Starting at 25 the rate steadily increases every year until 64 where it is one rate until death.    The biggest jump in premium is from 20 - 21."
Boise,2lxnrt,ickeePoo,4,Tue Nov 11 04:32:18 2014 UTC,Years 1-5:$35k-47k Years 5-15$48k-56k Years 15-25:$63-85k  I feel this would be the most appropriate. Much more than that and they'd be overpaid.
Boise,2lxnrt,Sterling_____Archer,3,Tue Nov 11 17:55:18 2014 UTC,"According to the article, in 2013 the Boise fire department's average full-time employee - including support staff - earned $85,000 in wages, as well as $50,000 in city contributions to insurance and retirement accounts. 24.5 percent more compensation than a decade ago.  It's hard for me to process a 24.5% increase in wages that occurred alongside one of the worst economic climates in the last century.  It would seem that the Boise firefighters didn't feel the downturn like the rest of us."
Boise,2lxnrt,Scipion,3,Tue Nov 11 20:18:32 2014 UTC,"To be fair the fire department is one of the most used/ most abused/ and most appreciated public services that we have in our nation. It takes a lot of time, training, and dedication to perform the job. You have to provide competitive wages if you want to have someone good at their job saving your life.   If the budget is looking tight, cut police dollars. I mean, how many millions did they spend a couple years ago on their three-year planned raid that busted a few dozen head shop owners and then let them all go the next day."
Boise,2lxnrt,mbleslie,2,Tue Nov 11 23:50:54 2014 UTC,It's hard to be a firefighter because so many guys want to get in. They place barriers to entry.   If it was a free market wage they'd make significantly less than they currently do.
Boise,2lxnrt,FortuneDays,1 point,Thu Nov 13 21:52:13 2014 UTC,"You inspired me to do a bit of research!  Factoring in inflation, they're actually making 2% less than they were in 2003.  Of course, their pay actually went up (Or, factoring for inflation: didn't go down.) Almost every other government position stopped 'stepping' (the tenured word for 'raise') in 2008 (Why 2008?).  My first guess as to why this happened is that, in 2009 (When budgets would first be questioned post-economic-apocalypse), the fire department stopped hiring new firefighters. By having a smaller team work fewer hours, they're able to save tremendously on costs- even with how much more expensive overtime is.  A quick search returned this article on KBOI2 which showed that I'm mostly correct. Firefighters stopped being hired in 2009. According to the article, several even retired. This article was probably one of many that created bad PR for the fire department, causing the note towards the end: in 2014, overtime is supposed to decrease.  There were a lot of interesting quotes in that article, one of which is:   The Boise Fire Department’s budget for fiscal year 2013 was $45 million, just over $3 million of it went to pay for overtime.   I'm not a math wiz and I don't know what exactly makes up that $50,000, but if it's approximately $50,000 for each employee, the practice of having more overtime and less employees would make sense so long as firefighters on average were earning less than $50,000 annually past their base salary.  TL;DR: As it turns out, the only way that firefighters have kept up with inflation is by working overtime, which is a part of the reason their salaries seem so high. They've since hired 30 new firefighters and overtime is expected to drop in 2014.  So, how much should they be paid? I don't know. I just wanted to know if I should be upset, and I don't think I should."
Boise,2lxnrt,def_oj,0,Wed Nov 12 00:22:25 2014 UTC,"Try again, the reported increases already factored in inflation. I'm not complaining by the way, they work hard, risk their lives, and should get paid well."
Boise,2lxnrt,Scipion,2,Wed Nov 12 05:13:23 2014 UTC,"I know someone in the Kuna Dept. He said 48k, but he does a lot of overtime which pays a ridiculous amount so he's not really sure, probably closer to 60k. Boise FD makes ""quite a bit more than me"" he says."
Boise,2lxnrt,Malbranch,2,Tue Nov 11 16:29:56 2014 UTC,"My girlfriend moved here from California, and one of the first things she noticed about Idaho was that about half of our business names were puns.

I'm a state employee so I know the drag being a public employee can be, you have to fight for even the most inadequate raise but we're well behind other states. If firefighters are looking to make more than SLCFD I'd be curious why SLCFD makes less, why that comparison is the way it is."
Boise,2lxnrt,Sterling_____Archer,-2,Wed Nov 12 03:37:46 2014 UTC,Average staff earned 85k a year? There is no way that can be correct. Many lawyers and Doctors don't even make that much.

Boise,2lv4fk,principledsociopath,12,Mon Nov 10 18:39:08 2014 UTC,"It's the smell of money.  The biggest smells come from TASCO (the sugar factory) and the Simplot (formerly Carnation) food processing plants.  When those factories are moving lots of product through, the smell gets pretty bad.  When they stop smelling like they do though, then that means a lot of people will be out of a job.  I used to work at MPC Computers, which was right down the road on Karcher.  I kid you not, they had a hotline to call if the smell from TASCO got ""too bad.""  I couldn't believe it was real when I first started there.  There were so many things wrong with it.  First, TASCO was there first and the smell was not a hidden fact.  Micron/MPC knew it was there when they chose that location for their facility.  2. TASCO can't magically make the smell disappear when they're processing sugar beets.  One time I picked one up off the side of the road and decided to try to boil it myself to see how the process works.  My wife was not happy, the house smelled like TASCO for a week.  3.  TASCO made more money (profit even!) in a week of processing beets than MPC probably made the entire time they were there.  Even if the other two points weren't there, they were still ""low man on the totem pole."""
Boise,2lv4fk,JJHall_ID,4,Mon Nov 10 18:14:36 2014 UTC,I remember the MPC fiasco. They tried to sue TASCO for the smell.  Absurd.

Boise,2lv4fk,Redemptions,4,Mon Nov 10 18:52:03 2014 UTC,"I worked at MPC, too, and can confirm all of that. I remember a few times, when the weather was just right, it would be snowing in and around the MPC parking lot and literally no where else in the valley. Whatever was going up the TASCO stacks was precipitating snow out of a clear sky.  Also, when I was a kid both my parents worked at the sugar beet factory off and on over the years. That smell is insidious. No matter what they did to keep it at work it would spread until the house, the car, and every piece of clothing we owned smelled like fried beets.  EDIT: grammar."

That should have been my clue that the new management were idiots.  It used to be a much better brand in every way. Micron occupied it's own niche perfectly.  Then, some idiot thinks ""cheap computers sell more than expensive computers; if we sell cheaper crap than anyone else, we'll be the biggest manufacturer in the world.""  It was a disaster. Machines were literally going up in smoke on the line, and the ones that made it out to the customer looked, felt, and ran like crap. In the end, the company deserved to die."
