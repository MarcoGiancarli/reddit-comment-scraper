vikingstv,3di7le,Pseudoing,11,Thu Jul 16 14:01:56 2015 UTC,"I love the fact that it seems so unrealistic when it actually happened in real life. Bjorn ""Ironside"" and his friend Haestein were raiding the Mediterranean when they reached the town of Luna. Thinking it was Rome, Bjorn was hellbent on raiding it but the town seemed impregnable. To get around this, he sent emissaries to the church in Luna saying that he was close to death and wished to make a deathbed conversion to christianity and be buried on holy ground. Hoping to set an example to all heathans, the priests agreed and Bjorn was able to burst out of his coffin and open the gates from the inside like Ragnar did in the show. This was his last great raid before he retired to rule in Scandinavia.   I knew this before the finale so I was able to predict the ending."
vikingstv,3di7le,BunderBluss,-3,Thu Jul 16 15:16:44 2015 UTC,"Which is great, but the problem is that it was preceded by the stealth mission, which accomplished virtually the same thing."
vikingstv,3di7le,thewackjob,5,Thu Jul 16 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"I think you are over thinking a little bit.  You are right when you say there is no need for Ragnar to keep his plans secret.  The main reason he keeps them secret is specifically for the scene where Rollo, Lagertha, and Floki speak to his coffin while he listens inside.  Ragnar is always thinking ahead, and he has been betrayed before.    Another important thing that I think you are forgetting is that his plans were not completely secret. He told Bjorn of his plans and said something along the lines that he was the only person he could trust at the time.  This explains the setup of the coffin ""confessions"" of his inner circle and the fact that the Vikings hung around for a while and were ready to raid the city. They are always mentally ready to pick up their axes and do battle, Bjorn was just able to keep them there long enough.   Letting the princess live and go back is not a terrible decision.  He learns how important she is when he takes her hostage in the church and decides to show her that they are not mindless savages, that they can show compassion.  This is important for the fallout of the finale, and Rollo sticking around to marry her and go on and begin his epic stories i assume.   Why not repeat a failed strategy under different circumstances? This time was well thought out by Ragnar, who for the most part had let others make the decisions for trying to enter the city up until this point.  They didn't go there to conquer Paris, they went there to raid it and that's exactly what they did.    You're entitled to your opinion, I just thoroughly enjoy this show and wanted to try and shed some new light on that episode and this season for you. Ragnar is always thinking ahead, always curious, and always striving to learn new things. He will do anything to achieve that knowledge, and that is what is most important to him personally."
vikingstv,3di7le,awdufresne,2,Thu Jul 16 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"Remember that scene during the first siege of Paris where Ragnar is on the ramparts? So when he's struggling against all those guards he looks over the wall at the city. The look is one of longing and wonder and curiosity. This isn't a coincidence or just for dramatic effect.   Ragnar has always been an explorer first, his curiosity is that which starts the events of the show (talking to the wanderer and getting the navigation materials from him). By Ragnar making a ploy to get into the city the writers are actually staying true to his character.   Think about this for a second, Ragnar is trying to fight an infection so his rationalizing skills aren't where they should be so to him launching an elaborate scheme in order to get into the city to take a peek makes sense to his fevered brain. Even though the audience knows this is not a good idea, to Ragnar, who at that point we can assume believes he's dying from infection, this ploy would be his last chance to see the most advanced city in the world (his opinion) before he dies.   I'll agree that the writers have favored drama this season more so than the first two, but I only think this is shown with how the third season ends.   The first and second season end with 1/4 cliffhanger or suspense for the future but had 3/4 resolution.   The third season is the opposite, 3/4 cliffhanger/suspense (maybe even more honestly) and only 1/4 resolution. Which in my opinion sacrificed a more consistent narrative for drama and suspense."

I didn't ""get"" it right away and I heard others were asking for weeks, not clear that the first scene was his dream and the second was real.  It's a great concept, but the execution was flawed.  What would have done it is adding some effects- blurring the edges, more slow-mo, making his cross glow and hum.  Ideally, a glorious Christian chorus being the soundtrack.  Over-the-top enough that viewers would go ""WTF is this shit?  Seriously?""    Well, also, some kind of ""record scratch"" to show a transition to reality.  It's not just more clear- it'd be having more fun with the scene."

I think they deliberately wrote Rollo that way. He isn't meant to be instantly likable like Ragnar. Basically a lot of them are jerks but Ragnar is a more cheerful and funny person so it makes him look not as bad. I think the rape looked much worse because Rollo does it casually and walks away like nothing happened. It sort of implies he does this sort of thing on a regular basis.  There are also a few mostly good characters and some really, really nasty ones.  I found Lagertha and Aethelstan really likable characters, and also Björn mostly."

They've been building the story line for nearly 20 years, with very little breaks or pauses in the stories progression. Given the character Travis is playing, this part of the story line takes places before the beginnings of World of Warcraft. Looks to be around the start of the Warcraft saga as a whole.     There's enough source material for Warcraft to give the Starwars and Harry Potter anthologies a run for their money."

Loki was then taken, in his regular form, to a cave. The gods then brought in Loki’s two sons and turned one into a wolf, who promptly killed his brother, strewing his entrails across the cave floor. Loki was then fastened to three rocks in the cave with the entrails of his slain son, which the gods had turned into iron chains. Skadi placed a poisonous snake on a rock above his head, where it dripped venom onto his face. But Loki’s faithful wife, Sigyn, sat by his side with a bowl that she held up to the snake’s mouth to catch the poison. But every so often, the bowl became full, and Sigyn would have to leave her husband’s side to dispose of its contents, at which point the drops that fell onto the unrepentant god’s face would cause him to shake violently, which brought about earthquakes in Midgard, the world of humanity. And this was the lot of Loki and Sigyn until, as destined, Loki broke free from his chains at Ragnarok to assist the giants in destroying the cosmos."

vikingstv,3cvzds,dsrtfx_xx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:46:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure that holds true. The whole threesome thing pops up first with Athelstan, once more prior to the big duel, and then afterwards its completely and utterly dropped.  To the best of my knowledge, its basically NEVER brought up again. I'm sure the Vikings were very open, but it doesn't really make that much sense (I mean, Ragnar is trying to have a ton of sons, and if Athelstan is all up in Lagertha, how is he going to know whose the father!).  Cato's explanation makes slightly more sense. Equally plausible, one of the writers had a thing for it and managed to get some nods to it in there."

Now if I happened across show spoilers, they couldn't make a dent in what I've witnessed at Uppsala, the Blood Eagle or the crop blot. I found History Channel captivated my visual experience to the highest level, regardless.  I'm not one to argue Viking continuity but I'm sure astute scholars of Viking studies have every right to enter into challenging each other.

This is also about the time of the settlement of Iceland, then later Greenland, and later the voyage to the Americas (around year 1000). They may need to compress time a little but they already did that for the French bits too.  Then there were also raids in the mediterranean, and of course the settlements in Russia, Ukraine.

vikingstv,3bziff,thebeginningistheend,3,Fri Jul 3 12:18:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think, in reality, that Rollo was ever in charge of Paris.  Anyway, s3 started at slow as it was building to Paris and, as a person who's watched episodes 8-10 a billion times, I love it.  The spiky spindle of death followed by the trickster scene with the hands getting chopped off was, hands down, the best hands chopped off scene I've ever seen."
vikingstv,3bziff,duckandcover,6,Fri Jul 3 21:33:47 2015 UTC,"I found the entire second half of season 3 to be a let down.  Too much focus spent on the drama, political and religious bullshit of the french characters, too little time spent on what vikings was originally about.    I think if you added up all the 2 minute segments of the French sitting in a church or having prayers and religious chanting, you'd get like 12-20 minutes of just that, which is actually a pretty sizable chunk of the season just dedicated to us watching people sit around in Church.  Yes, we get it, they're ultra religious.    The sacking was exactly as you described it, disappointing and lackluster.  I'm really hoping season 4 focuses more on the characters and actual vikings we know and less on the antics of Count Odo and his 50 shades shit."
vikingstv,3bziff,dsa2780,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:21:39 2015 UTC,I think they are trying to spread the focus and have some character development. There's a reason a good amount of screen time was dedicated to Eckbert and the English even though all the Vikings were gone.   I think the shows going to move in a more game of thrones style where the plot bounces between multiple story lines which will eventually intertwine rather than exclusively following the exploits of Ragnar.

There were some stand out scenes - tiny snippets here and there -- the whole scene where they're trying to get up the stairs, that was pretty intense - Floki doing the rally cry, awesome.  But the over all siege of Paris was lacking something - Like it didn't have a purpose(?) :shrugs: It was almost a de ja vu of what happened last season when they were ambushed by King Ebert and King Aella.  They lost; I guess we don't like seeing our Vikings loose.  lol!  In fact, the whole season lacked something - the sparkle was missing.  I absolutely loved how season 2 started out with a bang, with Rollo galloping into battle - woof! that was awesome.  This year didn't live up to last years gravitas.    I wonder if S3 was just a set up for whats to come in S4.  Cause S1 was also a set up for S2 and that worked out nicely."

Something was odd and out of place.  Maybe it's cause it's Vikings 3.0 and they're not as humble looking as in VK 1.0 - they're attitudes have changed a lot since then, they're costumes, too, there's more power involved - we as fans are struggling to adapt to that change so suddenly."

I would have had Bjorn pop out of the coffin rather than Ragnar, he could have been waiting outside the gates; also he should have taken the cowardly emperor hostage and most of all, there should have been a proper battle for the bridge, it just looked like the Parisians gave up as soon as Ragnar opened the gates."

They proceeded inland to the town of Luna, which they believed to be Rome at the time, but Björn found himself unable to breach the town walls. To gain entry, he sent messengers to the bishop to say that he had died, had a deathbed conversion, and wished to be buried on consecrated ground within their church. He was brought into the chapel with a small honor guard, then amazed the dismayed Italian clerics by leaping from his coffin and hacking his way to the town gates, which he promptly opened, letting his army in.

vikingstv,3borks,Grokrok,7,Thu Jul 16 23:06:29 2015 UTC,"Most of the filming is in Ireland using Irish extras. That explains the Irish-appearing ""Saxons."" Regarding battles, the show has been pretty even-handed on showing the Vikings being defeated in battles versus them victorious, their lightening attacks give them an advantage in skirmishes, but they bog down in the big battles on foreign turf. On the show Aelle/Eckbert teamed up to give Horik/Ragnar a pretty sound drubbing, as did the Parisians (at first). Keep in mind the shows a family drama centered on Ragnar and his kin, not a historical documentary."
vikingstv,3borks,Oznog99,7,Wed Jul 1 00:47:26 2015 UTC,"Vikings is an Irish-Canadian co-production.  So that explains the Irish actors.  Vikings is FAR from historical.  WTF, the ""loot"" was a side business.  Their cash cow was the slave trade.  Slaves only ""exist"" in this story when Ragnar said Athelstan wasn't a slave.  And Bjorn told Porrun she wasn't a slave.  So they only come up when NOT a slave.  The slave trade and relationship with house slaves isn't a thing in the story."
vikingstv,3borks,BarneyBent,5,Tue Jun 30 23:59:29 2015 UTC,It's hard to tell a story that's sympathetic to slave traders.

vikingstv,3borks,Oznog99,3,Wed Jul 1 07:18:35 2015 UTC,"Yep!  That would be a tough sell. But without it, the show's premise is hard to understand.    They ""sack"" things but don't take much of note to justify a whole campaign.  No trading arrangement is shown, so it's unclear who they buy things from with this treasure.  I mean, you can't eat gold.  If Kattegat is isolated, circulating 5,000 gold coins amongst them doesn't actually get you anything new, they'd be trading them with each other for the exact same goats and mead that they were going to produce anyhow.  So they all end up with these spoils and take a treasure bath and then the ""treasure"" disappears from the plot, nobody is visibly wealthy, and Kattegat seems mostly unchanged."
vikingstv,3borks,Tarnsman4Life,3,Wed Jul 1 05:43:57 2015 UTC,"This, slaves were the cash cow of the vikings, the loot was an added bonus but was not nearly as well available nor easy to acquire as slaves.

We see the lies and miscommunication that resulted in the snubbing of William of Normandy and the creation of Harold Godwinson as king.  Far away, we see the plotting of Harold's scheming brother Tostig with Harald Hardrada, the viking king of Norway. We also see William raging and plotting to invade England from Normandy.  Harold has enemies on every side. He rallies an army and occupies the south coast. But nothing happens. Then... Halley's comet. It's a sign! But of what?  William's invasion is repeatedly delayed by weather. Little does he know these delays cause Harold's bored soldiers to start slipping away to go work the fields with their families. What William thought was a problem is an asset. As summer drags on, Harold must fight to keep his army together. Then... Tostig and Hardrada invade north England with a huge army of vikings. They lay waste to Mercia and Northumbria. Harold gets word and marches his army north at breakneck speed, a speed march that is remembered to this day as nearly miraculous.  Harold meets his brother Tostig, King Harald Hardrada and their massive viking army at Stamford Bridge. Harold Godwinson bottlenecks the vikings on the bridge and destroys them in a brutally violent massacre. Tostig and King Harald Hardrada lie dead. VICTORY!  Harold gives his weary victorious army some R&R. But it doesn't last long. In a few days, he receives word that William has invaded the southern coast of England!  Harold rallies his weary army and marches them all the way back south, again at breakneck speed.  At the Battle of Hastings, Harold's weary army fights bravely but William's fresh troops and supply chain win the day. Harold Godwinson gets an arrow in his eye and dies. William sweeps north, toppling castles and battlements, and sits himself on the throne as King of England.    Now THAT would be some exciting and dramatic stuff! Come on, History Channel! DO IT!"

It was interesting to me because it was the only time in English monarchy where the King was executed while still in power. All of the revolutionary thoughts that came out of this period - in forms of art, music, and poetry - have carried on to this day, still potent as ever in their message. I especially want to see the exile and rise of King Charles II back into monarchy, and how he won the heart of the masses who had largely held onto their anti-crown opinions since his father last ruled."

He could do something like Hallbjorn Halftroll or his child Kveldulf Bjalfason. the last would make sense with the upcoming season and the casting of Harald Fairhair - Kveldulf opposed Harald and ended up going to Iceland. He could do Skalla-Grim as well I suppose, who is the father of Egil. None of these folks, save maybe Hallbjorn, is as big as Egil though.  Egil is also Iceland's national hero.

It would have been more interesting if he knocked her up, didn't marry her and then she got injured and then felt like she didn't have a future. There would have been some conflict then. She was a former slave who married a prince and got to live her 'dream' of being a shield maiden. She was incredibly fortunate in rising to the position she had. And then when she did, she just whined about being injured. No, she won't be missed by me if she doesn't return."

Would've worked better like this:   She meets Bjorn She slowly becomes close with Bjorn Bjorn tries to teach her to fight, she isn't that interested despite her underlying will to be just like Lagertha. She doubts herself too much. She becomes a free woman, no longer a servant Wears fancy dresses, acts like royalty etc. Everybody leaves for battle, she feels stranded Wants to stay true to herself and do some hands on work, finally try and be like Lagertha She trains Everybody returns and Thorunn has developed greatly as a fighter with huge potential. She looks badass. She goes to battle, but like as already happened, she gets her face cut by being a bit too wreckless Has her break down, blah blah blah More self doubt about her life Has baby and leaves Season 4 she returns as a lone warrior, renewed attitude and confidence.  Will she take her child back? Get back with Bjorn? Still lots of good potential events could come out of this.   I think she'll come back a new person. To cut ties with her character the way they did would leave a bit of a stain on it for me."

If this description seems a bit all over the place, that is also accurate as the show does seem disjointed in its themes. I think they will sort it out be season 2. I don't know if I want more martial arts action, and less marco. But I have faith. I do want more ghengis Kahn, that actor was very good."

The weird stuff about the War God Sword is part of his traditional mythology.  Production values on the battle scenes are in many ways better than Vikings.  They missed value of climate and weather though.  Too much sunny afternoon scenery.

Such a character, one of my all-times favourites."
vikingstv,3a3zcu,_KimJongSingAlong,4,Thu Jun 18 17:14:27 2015 UTC,"I knew Ragnar's death was a scam from the start.  The seer told someone (Aslaug?) that the dead would conquer Paris.  At first I thought they would use catapults made by Floki to fling dead and diseased bodies into Paris.  Floki built siege towers/ladders, but not catapults, so I kept thinking about which ""dead"" would conquer Paris.  When Ragnar was ""fatally"" ill I knew he would be the dead to conquer Paris.  The coffin was clearly a Trojan Horse.  The Franks made a big mistake letting Ragnar's warriors carry the coffin in past the city gates.  The finale was a bit of let down for me because I could see what was going to happen."
vikingstv,3a3zcu,toekneeg,5,Wed Jun 17 20:06:01 2015 UTC,I thought the seer meant that the conquering of Paris would not be worth it as so many would need to die for it to be achieved.

vikingstv,39azby,Vin436,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:48:07 2015 UTC,there's a theory that GoT is a re-telling of Ragnarok within a English medieval setting:  http://gameofthronesandnorsemythology.blogspot.ca/2013/05/ragnarok-song-of-ice-fire.html  http://gameofthronesandnorsemythology.blogspot.ca/2013/06/direwolves-wargs-stark-children.html  edit: second link
vikingstv,39azby,lingben,32,Sat Jun 20 21:14:49 2015 UTC,"I would add that Vikings has a handicap that GoT does not: Vikings is dramatized history. It has to adhere to some rules for plot development. It has to stay within a strict set of standards (costume, technology, culture). We can't have Ragnar sail to Japan and unleash dragons on Kyoto.   GoT can capture the audience by switching to fantasy at a moment's notice. Costuming and scenery can be imagined and implemented without penalty. GoT has so much leeway in telling its story that the producers find themselves with a glut of possibilities.   Not so with Vikings. Sure, they can dramatize life at Kattegat. They can infer some miracles from the Norse gods. But in the end, they have to tell us the saga. Did Ragnar actually invade Paris? Historians disagree. Was Ragnar's brother Rollo the actual Rollo that founded Normandy? Historians disagree. But we have no option but to portray these events. And it has to be done in context, with no snow giants or dragons.   Which is ""better""? I don't think we can apply the same standards to these two shows. We can only judge them together as dramatic serials. In that vein, I would judge GoT as a more compelling show because its narratives are so wide, and it casts nets so huge, that one's imagination is deeply engaged. Vikings is a smaller story in a smaller world, yet, like ""Rome"", it engages us because it explores moments that history has forgotten and makes historical events come to life before our eyes."
vikingstv,39azby,CitizenTed,14,Wed Jun 10 16:37:04 2015 UTC,"Oh tosh. Pure and utter tosh.    First of all, in the Sagas (not necessarily Ragnar's), we have people fighting wyrms, seamonsters and being beset or blessed by gods in very many ways. We have magical armour and shirts and legendary swords. We have journeys far beyond the horison. To claim Vikings cannot draw from a lot more fantasy is ridiculous.     Especially considering your argument for that being historicity. Because honestly, Vikings is really, really, REALLY far off, both in technology and costuming. Combat and plenty of other things as well. The actual cloth costumes have gotten better, I'll give you that, although it's still not up there with proper history shows. However, the armour in Vikings is way, way less proper than even the armour in Game of Thrones, and that is saying something. These people go to war in biker gear and useless composites. The cavalry of the british used Burgonets, those are 16th century helmets. That's farther away from the 9th century than from the 21st my friend. They simply did not have the metallurgy to create it.    Hell, you know what would be MORE correct than those helmets? Handcannons, bombards and huge ship loaded with cannons and gunpowder. Because all of that came before those stupid helmets.    The yellow armours with lots of studs and rivets on them try to be brigandines and fails, hard. And guess what, brigandines are way, way, way later. 15th century to be frank. And they most certainly don't look like that.     Untreated leather is great for scrapes ala biker gear, useless for defense against weapons. Even worse when you stick bits and pieces of chainmail to it, because the chainmail will pretty much guide any incoming weapon into the softer leather, which will then be pierced.     The solid breastplate of the french commander was ridiculous in form, function and technology required to actually create something like that.     Vikings decided it wanted to do history, took one look at history and decided that no, they wanted to do a historically inspired piece. Then they added gods with a nearly tangible presence. Sure, it can be argued that they're more part of a mental state, and I can agree to that. But I'd be much more willing to agree to that if the show actually bothered trying to do historical vikings. Not... This.      Seriously.     This show is pretty much just as much hollywood fantasy as Game of Thrones is, the only difference is that they don't actually have the budget to add dragons."
vikingstv,39azby,Neknoh,5,Wed Jun 10 17:37:35 2015 UTC,15th century to be frank.   I see what you did there.
vikingstv,39azby,osirusr,10,Wed Jun 10 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"No, not pure and utter tosh!   For one thing, GoT has no reason to abide by any historical standards at all. For all we know it's occurring on a distant planet in another galaxy, whose humanoids have just now paralleled the medieval period of Earth. Baelish can wear a Nehru collar and long coat while Varys rolls around in a robe, and it doesn't matter that they're contemporaries because there are no rules to which they must abide.   Vikings, OTOH, has to at least try to be historically accurate. Is it flawlessly so? NO. But as has been said in this subreddit a billion times, it's a drama, not a documentary. We should judge it in comparison to other historical dramas like Tudors, Rome, and Borgia. Which of these hews closest to its period? I'd argue Vikings is way up there, near the top, for period authenticity. The Viking period was far shorter on written history, so the producers have (and use) a lot of leeway in telling the story, which I admitted and mentioned in my post above.   However, I was responding to OP's link wherein Vikings is pitted against GoT in a comparison of entertainment value. And my opinion stands: GoT has TONS more leeway in telling its story and has the option of erecting enormous fantasies to engage viewers, while Vikings must, by its nature, remain rooted in the filth and grime of Viking life. And thus, GoT has an enormous impact on viewers' imaginations, while Vikings has less of same, despite its fantastic production value."
vikingstv,39azby,CitizenTed,2,Wed Jun 10 18:05:54 2015 UTC,"It did NOT go with ""stay with a strict set of standards"".  The costumes are weirdly fabulous, and nonfunctional as armor.  The tech... well, ok, no dragons.  I guess in many ways they do stick with historical tech on many levels.  But they're not all that studious.    Culture... no.  Just no.  It's wildly fictionalized from the start.  Vikings were not autocratic like Haraldson.  The whole Viking culture and economy was based on slave trade, primarily to Islamic markets.  They're ""raiding"" but only bring back treasure and it's unclear how they actually better their lives on Kattegat since they don't seem to trade for things.  And goddamnit they knew there were ""lands to the west""."

vikingstv,39azby,ReinierPersoon,69,Thu Jun 11 13:52:46 2015 UTC,"Vikings is a good show, but Game of Thrones is simply better. It's really not a contest. From the Cinematography, the actors, the storyline, the writing. It's just clearly superior."
vikingstv,39azby,dicks4dinner,6,Wed Jun 10 16:09:09 2015 UTC,"You know what thrones lacks in? Fight choreography. It is so badly done for a show with such a huge following. I'll give you specific examples so you can rewatch and judge for yourself.  SPOILERS AHEAD  But a bunch of scenes where Jon snow is fighting when he's beyond the wall. Especially that fight when him and bran are passing by the same town and bran has to lay low so th arr t Jon wouldn't make him go back. Then the fight with Oberyn's daughters is sooo badly done it looks like it's kids fighting. Then most recently, Jorah in the fight competition he was so bad and for example, he does a summersault then stabs the guy with a spear but he's so slow that it's ridiculous how the guy doesn't kill him, it was noticeably bad. And it's weird that at times the scenes are so much better, like Oberyn Vs mountain was decent, blackwater and Jon plus wildlings Vs white walkers and whights was pretty good. It's sad that something with such high production value would disregard such an obvious thing. Also khaleesi riding dragons wasn't believable at all, you can easily tell it's green screened. But what they do amazingly well with is sets. Kingslanding is nice, sansa aunt's place is a cool castle, the place where arya is right now is beautiful not to mention the room of the many faced God. So yea battle scenes like the raid of Paris was better than the battle scenes in thrones, even better than blackwater. That one shot where you see all the floating battle towers, plus the actual fights are well choreographed"
vikingstv,39azby,macnbloo,2,Thu Jun 11 06:58:09 2015 UTC,Agreed. Both shows fighting choreography scenes were not that impressive to me. GoT just seemed to suffer from budget cuts. Many battles in each season are skipped completely.  One good fight scene u forgot to mention was the crows vs wildlings at castleblack and the wall. There was that one amazing moving camera panning landscape continuous shot that showed all the main characters fighting inside the wall...right before jon kills the thenn with a hammer to the dome. Best filmed action sequence in the whole series imo
vikingstv,39azby,noavgho,2,Fri Jul 3 05:22:10 2015 UTC,"See the budget cuts piss me off. They can afford better scenes. Yea the castle black scene was great but it pisses me off that they sometimes look like kids fighting in many scenes. Vikings always had a low budget but I've never seen the choreography suffer for it, it's usually the scale that's smaller but scenes like Paris fight scenes or when Rollo almost kills Floki, those were amazing. All the shield wall stuff, the fighting for mercia and kwinthereth too like the river scene when they choose which army to fight. That was all amazingly done."
vikingstv,39azby,macnbloo,2,Fri Jul 3 05:42:44 2015 UTC,"forreal, the Jarl borg + Rollo vs Ragnar's army battle was one of my favorites. the way they fight just looks more fast-paced and seems the actors had better training in sword/axe technique.  they also frequently use a little bullet time slo mo effects like when throwing spears or charging. really makes the fighting more memorable.  i'm still disappointed we never got to see robb stark fight. not showing robb vs jamie lannister was a big mistake on their part as i would think most viewers wanted to see that.  also the direwolf kills were not creative at all. anytime a wolf was there you could expect them to do the same thing - run up and jump into a guy's face. 5 seasons into the series and this very same lazy leap attack makes up 80% of direwolf scenes.  dragon kills make up for that though. the dragons are hella badass.. probably use up 90% of the budget right there"
vikingstv,39azby,noavgho,2,Sat Jul 4 08:08:51 2015 UTC,"I feel like they're getting ripped off on the dragons though, there's gotta be a cheaper way of having them on the show. Have you read the books? Were the dragons supposed to be rocky as opposed to scaly looking?is that why they're expensive? Or is it the fire? I mean a lot of shows have other worldly things/creatures in them and they have a smaller budget, what makes the dragons that expensive?"
vikingstv,39azby,macnbloo,2,Sat Jul 4 08:43:16 2015 UTC,"nah i only read part of 'the world of ice and fire' that has a bunch of artwork so i know the dragons are spiky skinned  couldn't find any info about the dragon footage cost but it seems like battles take up a huge part of the budget as well, with the wildfire @ blackwater being one of the most expensive episodes.  it seems like lighting people on fire, making the dragon's fire breathing look realistic are all costly too"
vikingstv,39azby,noavgho,-3,Sun Jul 5 12:38:30 2015 UTC,"/s ? The cinematography is objectively better in Vikings. Take any episode of Vikings and hold it up, scene for scene, against the very best episode of GoT and you will see. The actors in GoT may well be better, but their dialogue is worse and often the direction makes a scene unbearably fake, to the point where one has to consciously suspend their disbelief in order to get through the scene. The Storytelling in GoT may be better in ways, since Vikings does suffer from some stuttering and awkward pacing, but ultimately GoT suffers the more dramatic mistakes of hollywood cliches and HBO vanity. The writing is far more subtle, human, and sublime in Vikings than GoT. Where Vikings sometimes suffers from awkward pacing again (probably more an issue with editors in the cutting room than the writers) GoT suffers from mindless exposition and more vanity and fluff that stiffens characters and leaves you with that reminder that you're watching HBO's attempt at a big budget blockbuster designed to fulfill adolescent power fantasies.  I very much enjoy watching GoT for the most part, but it's hard to enjoy every episode and I have found myself repeatedly left dissatisfied with multiple scenes in every episode. I think there's like 5 or 6 times in the entire Vikings series where I've been pulled out of the show because something was off, and for the most part it feels like scenes were just smashed together awkwardly."
vikingstv,39azby,PenguinSnuSnu,22,Wed Jun 10 16:19:49 2015 UTC,I mean either way which show you prefer is kind of opinion based... i think both shows have their pros and cons.
vikingstv,39azby,dicks4dinner,4,Wed Jun 10 16:32:20 2015 UTC,true enough.
vikingstv,39azby,dicks4dinner,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:36:27 2015 UTC,true enough.
vikingstv,39azby,catSaysMeh,12,Wed Jun 10 16:35:33 2015 UTC,"I disagree with almost every part of that. When I watch Vikings, the sets to me don't feel nearly as authentic as GoT. The drab white, stony grays of Winterfell and Castle Black. The washed out greens of dangerous forests. The vivid yellows and red of King's Landing. I love the sets and the colors of Game of Thrones. It just looks better, I'm not sure how anyone could say otherwise. When I watch Vikings, you can just tell that they're scraping by on a small budget.  The most absurd thing, I think, is that you think the dialogue in GoT is somehow worse than Vikings? No, totally disagree. The dialogue in GoT is witty, funny, and intense when it needs to be. In Vikings... it's not. At least not in the same league. I think Ragnar has like 5 lines in the first two seasons of the show. There's honestly nothing memorable about any of the dialogue in Vikings."
vikingstv,39azby,Adamantium_Knight,6,Wed Jun 10 16:30:19 2015 UTC,"I guess I like the authenticity and humanity of Vikings compared to the fantasy and forced drama of GoT. The wordsmithing of GoT is definitely in it's own world when it shines. Unfortunately so much of GoT is poorly written that it really drags down the series as a whole. Vikings is not so glorious as GoT at it's peak, but the overall experience is way more subtle and nuanced."
vikingstv,39azby,nschirmer,7,Wed Jun 10 16:35:12 2015 UTC,I just don't know what you would consider poor writing in GoT without giving examples. I certainly can't think of any instances of outright bad writing.
vikingstv,39azby,catSaysMeh,3,Wed Jun 10 16:45:22 2015 UTC,"GOT SPOILERS:  Jamies rescue mission to Dorne was just one big, pointless clusterfuck that might as well have come right out of an action movie. I mean, no, why would he even consider going on an official diplomatic mission? It's not like he has the goddamn king on his side after all... Sneaking into Dorne, killing a few guards, slapping the prince and trying to kidnap Mycella is clearly the superior idea. Unless Jamie is just as stupid as his sister all of a sudden I'm going to chalk this up to the writers.  Also, Stannis. At first he's all like ""You're my daughter"" and ""There won't be any sacrifices"". One episode later: he burns his own daughter. Also Selyse who never really seemed to like her is suddenly devastated. A big yay for character consistency.   I don't know if these examples fit your definition for bad writing, they were just the first that came to mind."
vikingstv,39azby,nschirmer,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:50:44 2015 UTC,"Every single one of those examples is from Season 5. It's a fairly common opinion that 5 is the weakest season, because of book divergences and trying to work with GRRM.   But to apply 'bad writing' to the show overall is just absurd, and unfounded."
vikingstv,39azby,ChrisWF,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:36:43 2015 UTC,"Also Selyse who never really seemed to like her is suddenly devastated. A big yay for character consistency.   Well sure... She hated her daughter because she was diseased and scarred. But when it comes down to that final moment, when your daughter is burning alive and SCREAMING helplessly for you, that mother instinct understandably kicks in.  I can't believe you didn't get that at all. I don't think I could appreciate any of your analysis after reading that.  As for Stannis... that dude will do anything to become King. His mind is sadly set on it, which is why he's a great commander/strategist. He felt overly confident until their camp was attacked and burned... then he realized he needed to do something dreadful or give up and turn back. It was all over. It couldn't be all over. He had to do the sacrifice (in his twisted mind)."
vikingstv,39azby,bearnguyenson,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:38:39 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong. It's just that the woman with a unhealthy devotion to her god regretted the decision, while Stannis, who obviously loves his daughter and isn't a true believer, showed pretty much no remorse. I get the mother instinct thing, but Stannis' lack of emotion ruined the scene for me."
vikingstv,39azby,noavgho,2,Thu Jun 11 07:01:02 2015 UTC,"Mother instinct kicked in for her and she wanted to save her baby... Stannis had a look of devastation on his face, but he's the type of man who sees something through once he's made up his mind. In his mind, this was going to help him progress after seemingly hitting the end of the line. I'm sure he felt a lot of emotion at the time, he certainly wasn't standing there smiling... but he wasn't going to let his emotions control his actions the way she did when she tried to run for her daughter.  I mean the first time we saw this man was on the beach burning other people, he's just an awful guy when it comes to sacrifices for his own greater good."
vikingstv,39azby,Bigmethod,2,Thu Jun 11 08:07:43 2015 UTC,"for his own greater good   Agree with you until there. I am fairly sure he doesn't do it for his own greater good. He doesn't want to be king, but he feels/thinks he must be king because that's the order of things. To him, the right of the realm to have the proper king weighs more than the lives of hundreds of soldiers, and more than the life of a single child, even if it's his own daughter."
vikingstv,39azby,dicks4dinner,-1,Thu Jun 11 09:20:48 2015 UTC,"not to mention there are a lot of times where characters act completely different from in the books (as in what they do, not personality)"

Not many quotable lines in vikings wheras tyrion, littlefinger, tywin, bron, hodor all have some awesome one liners  Also dorn is the best set in the show. Very colorful costumes and palace settings.. and the watergarden fight/kidnap scene was filmed in some historical temple in spain"
vikingstv,39azby,Adamantium_Knight,-7,Fri Jul 3 05:35:22 2015 UTC,"Since when does game of thrones have good cinematography? The first three seasons yes, the show was fucking spectacular, but after the red wedding it seems like this show is in a dick measuring contest with itself.   Its constantly trying to out-shock itself with constantly stupider and stupider BS. This recent season specifically is a victim of that, where a lot of the ""developement"" is just shock value shlock that shows like The Walking dead stoop to.   Its disappointing to say the least."
vikingstv,39azby,dicks4dinner,5,Wed Jun 10 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"The Red Wedding happened in the book and legitimately affects the viewer. It's not shock for the sake of shock. I mean, if the writing and casting weren't so good, you wouldn't feel anything, and it would be shock for the sake of shock. If you didn't think ""The Mountain and the Viper"" was an excellent episode, and one that seems to be an example of your criteria for ""shock,"" then I would say that you don't know great TV. If you weren't moved and disgusted by  everything that happens in S5E09 (last week's), and simply think it's for ""shock value,"" then you haven't been paying attention. Vikings doesn't do anything in its storyline that makes me feel anywhere near the emotion that GoT does, because it's simply not written as well.  Nothing that has happened in Vikings can compare to the hate the writers and the actors make you feel for Joffrey or The Mountain. Nobody is nearly as clever, funny, or well written and likable as Bronn and Tyrion.   It's just hard to compare the shows because GoT is so obviously in another league."
vikingstv,39azby,Bigmethod,-6,Wed Jun 10 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"Yay... passing off your opinion as fact is always fun when a debate about television. Oh wait, it makes you seem like a pompous D-bag.   I don't give two shits what vikings makes you feel, that's why i responded from my point of view, not yours.  I addressed the cinematography, which is perhaps a BIT more objective. Game of thrones has laughable cinematography, especially this season. Whether it is that GOD awful amateur home-movie esq. fight between the sand snakes (or whateverthefuck their called) and bronn/Jaime, which was so laughably choreographed i felt like it was made by a sophomore in college majoring in business... or perhaps its just the stuff that is unnoticeable. The camera in the show isn't used as a tool to tell a story, but rather as a device to have two characters speak. That's boring and servicable at best when cinematography is considered.   Look at shows like Hannibal, which are at the peak of television cinematography. Pretentious, yes, but shot more beautifully than anything on television by far.   Listen man, i get it, you are a huge fan of Game of thrones. I like the show fine, just like i like the vikings fine, but don't let that shroud your vision."

I've tried watching the show and reading the books, and in both cases I made it about halfway through the second season/book before getting bored of it.  It's ok, but it's not that good.  Vikings, on the other hand, I have watched and rewatched several times.   I have turned dozens of people on to the show, and several of them now agree with me that Vikings is better than GoT.

vikingstv,39azby,Kelpie00,2,Wed Jun 10 22:01:43 2015 UTC,"GoT is more of a mind game, at least to me.  Trying to figure out who is planning what.  The style of the writing depends on having plot twists and shocking events taking place to generate a buzz.  And it feels good to correctly predict them.  There have been times where I felt like characters dying was merely to fulfill some arbitrary quota or because it was the thing to do on that show.  Similar to The Walking Dead, where they try to play off the ""nobody is safe"" feel but if they killed off their biggest draws the show would lose viewers instantly.  It is almost a caricature that makes the show feel less dangerous for the primary cast.  Vikings is more of an adventure and the characters are more straightforward with their motives.  I like the Historical-based fiction.  I spent a good few years reading Bernard Cornwell books and this show is basically his books on film(not the same characters but the style of the show matches many of the books).  I'd like to see a film adaptation of The Archers Tale trilogy, it would be interesting."

Viewer numbers is also a good indication of success from good production et al."
vikingstv,39azby,Zariuss,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:02:29 2015 UTC,"Why? Because the fight scenes are way way way way better in Vikings. The only fight scene in GoT that I was really impressed by was last season's climax battle at the Wall. Everything else is either poorly choreographed or unnecessarily taking place at night so the show with the largest budget ever can save a few bucks by making arrows on fire.   Used to love GoT, but starting with last season it slipped, while Vikings got incredible.  There's a sense of foreignness and mystery to the Vikings, which I attribute to Fimmel, Skarsgard and a few of the other actors, that just isn't there for GoT. And goddamn King Ecbert could shit on any of the ""gray"" villains in Thrones.   That ""article"" is terrible though"

vikingstv,39azby,dylanfurr246,-3,Fri Jun 12 12:18:38 2015 UTC,"Game of thrones is significantly more gamey than Vikings. Vikings isn't a fantasy show.   Game of thrones is highly reliant on this fantasy element, the whole ""Blood, sex, rape"" theme of it is really kinda grating at this point. The character deaths are ridiculously predictable and the show has stooped pretty low in terms of shock value content.   That being said, the first three seasons were spectacular and miles ahead of Vikings in pretty much every way."
vikingstv,399gvu,RecklessPaul,11,Wed Jun 10 05:33:13 2015 UTC,"Well, like pretty much all of the non-viking soldiers in the show, the abundance of quality armor and swords even amongst the lowliest of soldiers is quite out of place, but I admit it would be boring to watch without such colors/uniforms etc. Plus it makes it easier for us, the audience, to identify people.  I think the city itself is pretty accurate, because at this time it was pretty much only on the island (Ile de la Cite) whereas now the city is spread on both sides of the Seine. But the timeline is all out of whack. It's only a few years into the ninth century in the show (I think by the end of season 3 it's probably 803-04), which was during the reign of Charlemagne, but they are portraying the current king in the show to be Charles the Bald. Charles was indeed the king during the time of the first sacking of Paris, but that happens about forty years after the current year in the show. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it is really just the result of the showrunners condensing history to show all the exciting things. But it does show that the series timeline is very different from actual history."

vikingstv,399gvu,ReinierPersoon,3,Wed Jun 10 13:48:49 2015 UTC,"I think Bjorn is supposed to be 21 in season 3, at least at the beginning, which would mean 802. The siege of Paris alone should have taken at least many months considering the landing, construction of siege engines, etc."
vikingstv,399gvu,genchris,3,Wed Jun 10 15:47:55 2015 UTC,"Roughly, we think.    I know there's a pretty significant contrast between the show's portrayal of Wessex (basically built in wood) and Paris (basically built in stone), but that's probably roughly accurate.  The Romans had a more significant footprint in what was then Gaul (historians really treat this as one Gallo-Roman culture eventually), and built a permanent garrison on the island where Paris is today.  From that point on, it was a pretty significant trading spot and well fortified.   The Romans never quite got as firm a hold on the British Isles and retreated from them eventually.  Fast forward a few hundred years, and Charlemagne united much of Western Europe into one empire, so its cities built more permanently.  But he didn't cross the channel, either.  So Paris is an older city than anything else the show has shown us, and it's been fortified a lot longer and more significantly.  But the show also made it seem (to me anyway - maybe I'm wrong) like this had been a capital city for a long time.  It hadn't.  Charlemagne's capital had been in what we'd now consider Germany.  His grandsons quarreled and divided up his empire, and Charles the Bald (probably the King Charles in the show) was the first one to live in Paris and ruled a much smaller area than his grandfather or his father had.  So the big palace we saw might have been an exaggeration. Paris hadn't been the capital for long at that point.  Charles was new there and they were new to the whole idea of having a king there.  The show also portrayed it with a pretty significant cathedral. We know it actually did have one back then, but I don't think we have any idea what it looked like.  It was torn down in the 1100s and modern Notre Dame built on top of it.  So we have vague descriptions of how it was large for its time and had five main halls.  But was the show one a few hundred years too advanced?  Probably.  Paris actually might have been rich enough to have had some soldiers in uniforms, and some uniform military equipment.  But it was probably not nearly as uniform as the show had it, where hundreds of soldiers wore the same thing and carried the same weapons.  But the show does that in Wessex, too and there, it's an absurd idea.  Paris would probably have had roughly standardized uniforms for the city garrison (say, they'd all have the blue tunic...but probably not the matching armor), or the guards immediately around the king.  But I think the degree of standardization in the show -- thousands of soldiers matching head-to-toe -- wouldn't have been the norm when the Vikings invaded.  edited - grammar"

vikingstv,395yca,Mixpickle,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:58:19 2015 UTC,This is great. I would order one but it ships from Canada. I don't even want to think of the costs on this heavy beast coming from the great north.
vikingstv,395yca,FusRoDahMa,2,Tue Jun 9 21:04:17 2015 UTC,"they have shipping costs listed. for me in WA, it was $200 in shipping."
vikingstv,395yca,raleel,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:50:12 2015 UTC,Steeep. I know it's heavy and I expect it but that's pretty much half the price of the item. Bummer. Wish they were local. I'd go pick it up in a heartbeat. :)
vikingstv,3964mx,LSherl33,3,Tue Jun 9 15:07:50 2015 UTC,"Kattegut! It's actually spelled Kattegat but since it's a name of Dutch origin it's consistently pronounced incorrectly by the people in the series.  It's not that the Norsemen were bad farmers, just that their land and climate were not optimal for farming, not with medieval technology at least."
vikingstv,393d3v,RecklessPaul,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:32:42 2015 UTC,I think they are reaching with the conclusions from his practice of seidr but it's interesting nonetheless how poorly and uninterestingly Odin is often portrayed in popular media. The Odin of myth sounds fascinating and hilarious. I suppose we see Odin more like we should be seeing Tyr (though Tyr isn't really known at all in pop culture)
vikingstv,393d3v,Mephistopholees,3,Tue Jun 9 06:14:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Marvel doesn't do him any justice at all, Odin was nothing like that. You're right, the Marvel Odin is way closer to Tyr.  It would be so much like Odin to disguise himself as an androgynous man and lead a large group of vikings to conquer the most powerful city in the Western world at the time, yet without truly taking a side but just to witness the chaos of battle.

vikingstv,38x1jk,hiiemmarco,7,Sun Jun 7 15:51:10 2015 UTC,"I recall him being pretty upset about his farm being attacked, so much so that he killed the man responsible."
vikingstv,38x1jk,Ysmildr,2,Sun Jun 7 16:15:05 2015 UTC,"He was upset about it and he said ''I will get the man who attacked my family'' or something similar, which is why i'm asking. Also the title is supposed to be s2 not s3."
vikingstv,38x1jk,Ysmildr,5,Sun Jun 7 16:18:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe he pulled a fast and furious and considered everyone on the farm a part of his family, and maybe they were extended family."
vikingstv,38x1jk,EllRD,2,Sun Jun 7 16:32:37 2015 UTC,"That was definitely my understanding, that it was more of a My people or my family than my family by blood"
vikingstv,38x1jk,Mephistopholees,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:12:16 2015 UTC,"Were his friends killed in the farm attack? I thought his friends were getting killed off from the Lindisfarne group (Leif, Svein, Torstein, Athelstan) which he clearly wasn't happy about. I thought the people on the farm were farmhands and their families, so Ragnar wasn't terribly chuffed in comparison to Lagertha and Bjorn almost dying (and some daughter long since forgotten from the narrative)   Also, if a man dies in a fight its their chance to go to Valhalla or Folkvangr. I suppose he would recognize the duties and expectations of his friends to protect, serve and fight, even to their death."
vikingstv,38x1jk,dsa2780,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:19:48 2015 UTC,"Family can make your name live on, which was kind of a big deal to people back then, especially any form of elevated social class or ""royalty"".  Family can continue that in the form of sons to carry on your name and exploits.  Friends?  Not so much.  They can speak good of you and have your back all your life, but as soon as you're old and or wake up dead, friends don't seem to mean much."

vikingstv,38uqzk,PickiestGamer,5,Sun Jun 7 03:29:00 2015 UTC,Probably just asked if she had a lover or husband or something of the sort.
vikingstv,38uqzk,yourflyisdwn,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:26:17 2015 UTC,He clearly says the name Ragnar. So what he asks is more specific than that.
vikingstv,38uqzk,yourflyisdwn,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:12:55 2015 UTC,"Well then he probably asks something along the lines of her relationship with Ragnar. I really don't think the specific word for word translation of what he says matters, it's pretty simple what he's asking in general."
vikingstv,38uqzk,RanShaw,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:36:49 2015 UTC,Call me weird but I really like understanding all the on screen information as precisely as possible. I for instance pause whatever I'm watching whenever some large amount of small text briefly appears on screen (for example when the Guardians of the Galaxy are put in prison in the movie). I also looked up most of the Chinese swearwords and such used in Firefly.
vikingstv,38uqzk,RanShaw,2,Sun Jun 7 14:48:15 2015 UTC,"Do you have a link to the scene? I could try to help but I can't pormise that I'll be able to discern more than a few words... I tend to work with Middle Dutch, rather than Old English but I did take an Old English class two years ago."
vikingstv,38uqzk,RanShaw,2,Sun Jun 7 12:27:20 2015 UTC,"I think linking to pirated material is against this subreddit's rules? Not sure but it is usual for subreddits devoted to a TV show. I can give you the time stamp though and the rest should be rather easy for you.  The scene starts at 10:30. My own modern language skills (German, English, Italian) are enough to discern when any translation seems to be more or less word for word but it doesn't really help to reveal anything beyond that sometimes something more or different had to have been said than Athelstan chose to translate.  The line I am most interested in starts at 12 minutes exactly but I'm sure more than just me would appreciate it if you feel like translating more.  In general this episode and the previous one were a bit strange when it came to translations. Sometimes there are subtitles and sometimes not. In some it was Old English that had been 'dubbed' into new English while leaving the Norse language untranslated while in others it was the other way around. My personal favorite was on the wagon where both languages, including Athelstan's translations, were depicted in their ancient languages with subtitles underneath. I'd have almost preferred it if all scenes between the two love birds had been that way."
