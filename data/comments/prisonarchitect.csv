prisonarchitect,3e4jrp,ModernistGames,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:08:04 2015 UTC,"Deathrow inmates only leave their cells for two reasons, to go to a hearing, or to go to the chair. As for why you are not getting any DR inmates there are only a few reasons.  1) The cell block you built isn't specifically marked as ""Death Row Only: in Deployment.  2) In your intake, the sliders that determine how many min, med, and max prisoners you get has a forth slider just for Death Row inmates, by default it is turned off so you just need to go and slide it on.  3) You are just really unlucky, it is all by chance, but typically I get a Death Row inmate every 5-10 game days so there is always that chance."
prisonarchitect,3e4jrp,jabbathederp,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:40:20 2015 UTC,You have to unlock death row through the bureaucracy tab using your lawyer. Then you should have an option to take in death row prisoners in the intake tab.

prisonarchitect,3dyuez,ModernistGames,29,Mon Jul 20 17:22:26 2015 UTC,I did this with my first legendary prisoner. A few days later I opened up the cell and he still came out swinging. When he was taken to a solitary cell I bricked that up. Then after a few days I noticed people kept getting killed right outside his cell. I considered abandoning the wing and looking for a call Winchesters emergency response.  What I actually did was open up the outside wall of his cell. He killed the worker and then ran all the way around the prison to pick a fight with the gate guards before finally dying to a barrage of shotgun blasts.
prisonarchitect,3dyuez,StarMagnus,16,Mon Jul 20 17:44:20 2015 UTC,"Actually before I sealed the cell, I just sealed the whole supermax solitary block but he broke out of his cell and broke my cctv camera so the block went dark. I waited a few game days and opened the wall. He was still alive and he was pissed. He killed about 3 or 4 guards before tasers and shotguns finally brought him down. I actually couldn't really have armed guards around him because he would just take their guns and start shooting, causing more deaths. I have another legendary in my supermax block but he and the rest of my supermaxes are all on perm lockdown and they seem to be ok.  I think they need to balance the legendary prisoners a little better. I mean some of them you get you just can't deal with. No mater how much security you put on them or how many doors you put in front of them (this guy could punch down solitary doors in a few seconds).  I think at the very least they need to be able to put food trays through the solitary doors instead of opening them because the main way he would kill workers and guards is by waiting til they opened his cell to feed him. BTW I had a little typo in my title, he was on perm solitary not lockdown."
prisonarchitect,3dyuez,VexingRaven,18,Mon Jul 20 18:07:27 2015 UTC,"I hope they keep it this way, it adds a bit of fun challenge to the frame, trying to keep an unstoppable monster at bay."
prisonarchitect,3dyuez,SquigMcG,14,Mon Jul 20 18:49:36 2015 UTC,"I also had a prisoner like this, so I went into the save file and changed his Security Level to Death Row and then just executed him."

prisonarchitect,3dyuez,cascer1,17,Tue Jul 21 01:25:38 2015 UTC,"This is why I have my legendary prisoners behind three layers of remote doors with armed guards in between, then another layer with two regular guards and then finally dogs outside. All separated from the rest of the prison by a fenced-off staff only zone that can only be accessed through a staff door with two armed guards next to it.  I don't want to wall them in completely."
prisonarchitect,3dyuez,cascer1,8,Mon Jul 20 18:04:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think that would have helped me with this guy because for one no amount of guards really helped and in fact made things worse. It would take about 4-6 tasers to take him down and when they didn't work he would steal shotguns off my armed guards. And 2 the only way he can get fed is when food is brought to his cell, but as soon as a guard or worker opened his cell to feed him he would just kill them. This is the first time I ever had to wall in a prisoner, none of my other legendary's gave me this many problems."
prisonarchitect,3dyuez,cascer1,4,Mon Jul 20 18:17:47 2015 UTC,"Try giving them a 'luxurious' solitary cell, with a bed, shower, drain and toilet. They'll be less likely to attack every single person in the prison."

prisonarchitect,3dyuez,Chafin123,5,Mon Jul 20 18:33:44 2015 UTC,put a power generator next to his cell and then have a fire fighter spray it. After this pull back the fire fighters until he's dead.

Darkness consumed him as he clawed at the damp walls of his tiny cell, snapping back fingernails and peeling layers of skin on the rough texture of the concrete. His stomach ate nothing but itself as sharp pains dug at his side. He had not eaten in days and his jumpsuit was wet with the musty stench of urine that clung to his body and stung the sores on his legs. Tears streamed from his face as he bellowed with fury and anger. His screams bounced around the tiny cell and nearly burst his eardrums. He slid to the ground and curled into a ball as there was not enough room to lay flat. He pressed face to the cold floor and his cheek squished into what he could only assume was his own feces. He wept into his bloodied hands and hoped for death, wishing he had not crossed /u/modernsitgames .  Is that dark enough for ya?"

It was rather funny actually, he was Extremely Strong, Extremely Tough, Quick, Volatile, Deadly and Expert Fighter, but was randomly murdered in my med-sec laundry room. Apparently he was an Ex-Cop and Snitch as well, so a group ganged up on him and killed him on the spot, losing only one of their own.   In retrospect I'm both happy and sad, because he'd wreck havoc on my inexperienced ass but still it'd be fun to handle it. Gotta make a max sec prison some day I guess."

prisonarchitect,3e1cet,LandoChronus,3,Tue Jul 21 05:04:00 2015 UTC,You could use the logistics section to set the canteen to only be for the medium security cell block. Then the canteen could be shared deployment.

prisonarchitect,3e0xef,riversofgore,3,Tue Jul 21 02:45:41 2015 UTC,"Best way to handle that is to zone a staff only zone at every entrance to your max security wing, kind of like an airlock. The prisoners will only be able to go through it with an escort."
prisonarchitect,3e0xef,SamRaven2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:05:41 2015 UTC,That's a good idea.  I could probably do that pretty easily with what I have built already.  Will they escort them to things like parole and visitation?
prisonarchitect,3e0xef,SamRaven2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:13:23 2015 UTC,"I know they will be escorted to parole, I'm uncertain about visitation, as I think I've had an issue with that in the past. I would suggest adding a visitation specific to the wing just to be sure it all runs smoothly."
prisonarchitect,3e0xef,McGreat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:16:49 2015 UTC,Having phones in the common room seems to be doing a pretty good job of fulfilling their family need. I made another parole room just for them though.  I think the only thing they don't have is a visitation area.
prisonarchitect,3e0wow,ict125,2,Tue Jul 21 02:39:46 2015 UTC,You could just use the intake tab to reduce the number of prisoners you take in to whatever you want. It also let's you designate the ratio of which security types to bring in. If you're a slow builder like me it's a great way to build capital and expand your prison in large chunks.

prisonarchitect,3dwesp,goetzjam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:45:33 2015 UTC,"The purpose, from what I understand is to have shared areas that work for certain level prisoners only.  For example, if you want a shared yard, kitchen, canteen for min\med and protective custody, but not for max security, you can create a system that would prevent max security from using it.  That is just one example, you can go crazy with designs to help ensure you run an efficient and effective prison."

prisonarchitect,3ds6sf,SuwinTzi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:49:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure then, because I've never had a problem with low pop prisons.  But I don't usually see inmates using the Common Room at all in my prisons, might be a bug?"
prisonarchitect,3ds6sf,SuwinTzi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:38:15 2015 UTC,"Its not just the common room, they barely seem to use stuff in the yard and just stand in the shower block during shower time doing nothing, even though hygiene is in the red. Last big prison I had didn’t even have a common room (just a big yard with everything) and there were no issues with needs. Its odd I only seem to have these problems when I try to make nice smaller prisons"
prisonarchitect,3ds6sf,Wolomago,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:41:51 2015 UTC,"I've no idea then, because I've never encountered this issue before."
prisonarchitect,3ds6sf,hadrianw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:02:40 2015 UTC,"Not so useful aesthetically but prisoners can use any amenities in the canteen during meal time after they are done eating. I make my canteen large enough to include showers, toilets, weights, phones, bookshelves, radios and prayer mats just so my prisoners can catch up on things tha t may be missing from the rest of my routine.   Then again my current prison also has three times as many deaths as releases so take all that with a grain of salt. One of my legendaries, James Cocks, forced me to create a high security wing of solitary. Gotta have three or four guards quickly respond every (all the) time he gets rowdy. If they don't quickly beat him unconcious he goes on a rampage destroying everything and killing several people."
prisonarchitect,3ds6sf,Superf1cial,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:40:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I tried that on my last prison, squeezed a few showers and toilets into the canteen even though there wasn’t much rooms, I did seem to help a little. Maybe I can add it on to this one, I definitely have the room to expand and add common room stuff to the canteen. Just annoying when you give them their own personal common room/showers and they don’t bloody use them."
prisonarchitect,3ds6sf,Grillarino,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:28:37 2015 UTC,"No, but I'm thinking I'll try to duplicate now.  Wonder if it's the isolation that is driving them wonky."
prisonarchitect,3ds6sf,Grillarino,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:38:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, it seem like it might be. They all just seem to stand in the areas, but not actually do anything. Very frustrating"
prisonarchitect,3ds6sf,heydudejustasec,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:19:46 2015 UTC,"I would change some things in the Regime, generally I would always go for 2 hours of showertime both at the beginning of the day after sleep and before going to sleep.  As you said they will stand there doing nothing for a while until most of the prisoners arrived, then they suddenly start showering. I had that problem too, adding another hour of showering fixed it.  Also always 2 hours of Eat, just cut the yard times they will do whatever they need in freetime anyways. If they need exercise they will go for it in the freetime. I would only add yardtime if you need them to be on one spot at a certain time."

prisonarchitect,3dpdg3,karamd,7,Sat Jul 18 15:08:39 2015 UTC,I was scared some one in dev team died
prisonarchitect,3dpdg3,ElGrappadura,5,Sat Jul 18 13:13:26 2015 UTC,Well written story :)
prisonarchitect,3dpdg3,lietuvis10LTU,4,Sat Jul 18 07:58:12 2015 UTC,Awesome story. Prison archirect makes ya not forget about individual prisoners all the while letting you take care of hundres
prisonarchitect,3dpdg3,FancyAndImportantMan,2,Sat Jul 18 14:12:04 2015 UTC,I remember meeting him the time he was sent to solitary for bringing a spoon to the canteen.  Welcome home friend. Welcome home.
prisonarchitect,3dofml,dizzle229,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:54:10 2015 UTC,"Did this happen when you loaded the prison, all of a sudden?"
prisonarchitect,3dofml,nathanskeletor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:03:55 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's been like this for a while."
prisonarchitect,3dofml,nathanskeletor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:23:12 2015 UTC,What door is in the front of your prison?
prisonarchitect,3dofml,spartyon7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:31:31 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess you have a worker stuck somewhere and it's backing up all of the jobs.  If you can't find him, I'd try firing your workers and hiring new ones.  I know there's one stuck in the yard at the bottom of the prison, unless there's a door there that I'm just not seeing. Even if it's just one worker it can mess things up.  Try locking the doors open that have the red triangle above them and that may help too.     Death row inmates cells need to be at a 2 or 3 grade for them to be put in there automatically.  I would try removing a few things from their cells and adding them back in as their cell as their grade goes up."
prisonarchitect,3dofml,chaossabre,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:06:39 2015 UTC,"I tried firing and re-hiring the workers, but the problem persists. As for the Death Row inmates, they seem to have been moved to their proper cells without action on my part, no idea why they were in Max at first.   It's worth noting that the Route Failed problem doesn't just happen with workers, but also with janitors."
prisonarchitect,3dofml,spartyon7,2,Fri Jul 17 23:23:03 2015 UTC,"Your death row cells were too nice for them. They had to earn nicer cells through good behaviour before they could be moved into those cells. Always having at least 1 ""quality 2"" cell in each security level and preferably a mix of qualities is a way to prevent this.   We're all hoping the next update makes the cell quality mechanic more logical."
prisonarchitect,3dofml,spartyon7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:28:02 2015 UTC,"Have you tried firing the janitors as well? Also, have you tried cancelling all of the jobs?"
prisonarchitect,3dprv4,shamus727,3,Sat Jul 18 06:57:14 2015 UTC,"You can't, visitors don't take any notice of staff only areas or any security designation. They take the shortest route possible so if you want visitors to stay away from some areas, you should place the visitation room as close to the entrance of your prison as possible and if you have more than one entrance/exit then you'll have to take that into account."
prisonarchitect,3dprv4,da_53,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:41:24 2015 UTC,Wow. I spent like 2 hrs perfecting my delivery and entrance/recieving. And now its was all just a waste of time
prisonarchitect,3dprv4,adminbeast,-1,Sat Jul 18 15:45:45 2015 UTC,Staff door.
prisonarchitect,3dprv4,FlamingDrakeTV,9,Sat Jul 18 07:06:53 2015 UTC,"Pssh, they don't care about that. They will just stand by it and wait for someone to open it for them."
