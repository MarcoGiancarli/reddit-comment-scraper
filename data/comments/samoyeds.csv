You gotta be careful, you could cause a black hole to form or something.   I can just come back here anytime I've had a bad moment and smile..."

I recently found these Bret Michaels brand toys (I know...), and seriously, they're awesome. They're built super tough, and he can still enjoy the ""softness"" of them.    You can also try antlers. I've found that the solid ones (with no insides exposed), last longer. But he really like the scliced ones, and still shows interest in those once he's chewed it out.  Lastly, we love to play with rope toys. My only suggestion would be to put the toy away when you are finished playing. If he's anything like my guy, he'll sit there and chew it up and eat the pieces, which can be really dangerous.  Good luck!"

samoyeds,3e0bso,elecktronikah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:31 2015 UTC,"Wow! That's the only ""soft"" toy I've been able to get him that he hasn't destroyed. Your guy is a boss!   Maybe also try the Nylabone series toys?"
samoyeds,3e0bso,pumpkinskittle,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:06:40 2015 UTC,He's not as interested in those but I do have some laying around. I just wanted a soft toy that he wouldn't destroy. Guess that won't happen while he's teething!
