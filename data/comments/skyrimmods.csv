Keep the folder activated and at the end of the Mod List.  You can usually tell what mod the files are from just by going through them.

Persieds Inns and Taverns: Basic changes the pricing structure of taverns, and allows you to rent rooms for multiple days at a time (if you check the ""enhanced mode"" in the MCM), rent rooms for followers, etc. The ""full"" version overhauls all the taverns, but isn't compatible with the other mods on this list (and I dunno if it does as good of a job).  ETAC overhauls the interior of every tavern in every city it touches. I really like its interiors.  Inns and Taverns adds more taverns so you actually have places to stop along the road.  Sleeping Innkeepers forces the innkeepers to sleep.  Inconsequential NPCs and Interesting NPCs add more NPCs to the taverns, making them feel more alive. (And giving you someone to drink with!).  Sounds of Skyrim - Civilization adds lots of tavern-ey sounds to the taverns, making them sound more alive.  Skyrim Radioactive overhauls the Winking Skeever and the Bannered Mare, improving their visuals. Unfortunately it has deleted navmeshes, which can sometimes cause issues (it caused me some issues, which is why I don't run it anymore).  The Scottish Bannered Mare overhauls the Bannered Mare, improving its visuals greatly. However, I'm not a fan of the new layout, as it feels very cramped."

skyrimmods,3e4dk5,Illummizolldyck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:30:48 2015 UTC,Yes. You don't need the old versions.  The DL section is generally divided in 3 sections:   Main Files: you usually have to take at least one of these Optionals: usually reserved for compatibility patches or optional content/tweeks Old versions: Generaly can be ignored. It's there mainly there for people who have old save files that might depend on them or for use with other mod that depends on an ealier version for compatibility.   These are guide lines! You should always read the description to check which files you need. I can't really overstate how that is very super-duper extremely important to the limit over 9000!

skyrimmods,3e2e57,kontankarite,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:12 2015 UTC,"Tundra ENB - Warm/Chilly - Only ENB I've been 100% happy with and have been solely using this for some time.  I switch between Warm and Chilly occasionally for some minor variation.  Light blue skies outdoors, not overly dark indoors, character and npc's look great.  Grim and Somber ENBs - Malacath and Hircine are my favorites.  These were my go-to ENBs before finding Tundra.  Still switch out to them occasionally when I find a scenic screenshot spot.  True Vision ENB - Since you asked for three, I did like this one as well."
skyrimmods,3e2e57,Aspendawn,2,Tue Jul 21 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"Poupouri ENBs - Extended - Morning star ENB -  Love the look and atmosphere this enb provides, it has a nice blend between hyperrealistic and fantasy.   Realvision- I just keep going back to this ENB. I suppose it's the way I have set it up to my tastes. I use COT, ELFX, ELE. I get consistantly high fps. Sometimes I feel the saturation is a bit too high and unrealistic but then I just look at my follower and I'm like damn she looks good lol.   Seasons of Skyrim- Probably one of the most performance friendly and immersive graphical set ups in my opinion. I get much higher fps on this one compared to others, looks beautiful with COT.  Just wanted to throw one more out there also called Grim And Somber - Azura/Malacath. - Very unique graphical set up but heavy on performance. Looks awesome and very unique though."

Somber 3 is my favorite moody type enb. I've also tried VandB which does a great job of vastly improving vanilla look of the game.
skyrimmods,3e2e57,moosemm11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:19 2015 UTC,"Not really great at rankings, so I'll just include things I've used and liked.  1: Enhanced Shaders NLA, as it's a more neutral-toned and refined version of NLA version 1.4. Probably my go-to ""set it and forget it"" preset.  2: Ruvaak Dahmaan would be here, but you beat me to it. ╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ It was a severely underrated preset a few months ago, but has gotten a ton of deserved endorsements since then-- an older version of it was the first full-fledged ENB I played with, since it got along well with a lot of weathers while still providing its own visual style.  2, once more with feeling: Lumen ENB, which is sort of a continuation of Opethfeldt's preset. It's a softer-toned than the former, and gets along much better with the new ENB binaries. Very crispy and bright.  3: Szarik ENB-- a recent preset that's very moody without being very gloomy. Has a lot of browns, but also keeps a lot of yellow/red tones, and fits my idea of a ""rustic"" look to a tee.  Honorable mentions:  NLA v 2.0-- I loved it when I tried it out, but the finished version is literally newer than this thread . . . can't exactly pass judgement on something I haven't used.  ELEP 1.2.2-- the ultimate ""performance ENB."" The full-performance version corrects a ton of issues with the vanilla weathers and imagespaces (nuclear bloom, undersaturation, over-brightness, etc) with a basically nonexistent performance hit."

Skyrim's physics is hardcoded to the framerate, the faster the framerate is, the higher rate that physics is ran at, and it glitches out on anything higher than 60 hz."
skyrimmods,3e3j3s,MrGhoulSlayeR,3,Tue Jul 21 18:24:06 2015 UTC,I too just purchased a 144 Hz g-sync monitor. I use NVidia Inspector to cap the FPS at 60 and the game is completely tear-free and almost perfectly smooth. It mostly ranges 45-55 at 2560x1440 with NLA and tons of HD textures on my 970 G1.
skyrimmods,3e3j3s,Ferethis,3,Tue Jul 21 19:15:31 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to end up repeating what everyone else says, but I have a 980ti and the XB270HU (the acer ips g-sync panel.)   Turn off all instances of v-sync. The iPresentInterval under skyrimprefs.ini needs to be 0 (even though it doesn't do anything) and you need to add iPresentInterval = 0 under the skyrim.ini. Then use the nVidia Inspector program to set Skyrim to cap at 60 fps.   For whatever awful reason, ENB v-sync and Skyrim V-sync drops my frames a bit. Just capping it at 60 does wonders (though I do 62 for some wiggle room.) I had Vivid Textures 4K and Tamriel HD 4K with TAZ Visual Overhaul capping at 60 fps with Skyrim Flora Overhaul attached."

My order is   SMIM Book of Silence  ELFX ELFX SMIM patch (DO NOT MERGE - install it as a separate mod).    I have SMIM installed after all the bugfixes (USKP, various mesh fixes) and before any mod that adds textures (Book of Silence, Vivid Landscapes, etc.) or edits nifs for visual effects (Skyrim Shaders 2015, Potion Replacer, etc.). ELFX I have installed rather late so that its lantern meshes overwrite those from any other mods (such as Skyrim Shaders 2015). Then you need the SMIM patch.   In terms of load order it doesn't really matter either. I have SMIM loaded fairly early (before better dynamic snow), Amidianborn content addon loaded mid (near other armor things). ELFX.esp loads before any mod that edits the same cells (so it's pretty much right before ETAC in my load order) and ELFX_Enhancer.esp loads LAST (right after Realistic Water 2 and right before before WAO, ASLAL, and bashed/merged/procced patches)."

Jarls typically have quests outside the tavern postings if you speak with them directly. Whiterun is the exception.  2.) Progressing very little into Dawnguard unlocks radiant quests to hunt vampires/ gather dwemer schematics and parts. I think... three quests?  3.) You can join the Companions, which just from joining has a lot more radiant quest variation - rescue kidnapped victims, animal extermination, etc. In order to prevent progressing/ officially joining them, you can use the lite version of Enhanced Skyrim Factions - The Companions (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22650/?) to prevent progression.

(certain mods ""bake"" themselves into your save files. If you uninstall a mod and continue playing on that save, expect chaotic & unstable results later on) If I were you, I would finish modifying your mod-list and mod load-order and then start a new game. Once you make your first save, just dont touch your mods and continue playing without the need for any more editing.

Some of the mods you're using have been known to cause problems in the long term. E.g. Immersive beds. Try disabling this.  Start a new save and see if your new character might be able to enter whiterun. Might have to do with your current savegame in which case reverting to a previous save might help.

skyrimmods,3e0bt8,pheromonekvlt,14,Mon Jul 20 23:48:51 2015 UTC,"Because you end up wanting to try a new character concept. You try it, it's not as fun as your normal playstyle so you go back to it. You feel like there's more you could be doing so you make a new one again.  Then you see a mod that changes the game so you start over making a character based around that mod. See more mods, make more characters etc etc.  What I've done to stop this (about 12 days with my current character so far) is just go for my usual playstyle (sneaking and melee). And then dive into other gameplay types when I'm at higher levels (coming up with RP reasons usually). I also set goals for character that would take a long time to reach. I also save the main quest for last (including the DragonBorn DLC) because once i finish it, I feel like my character doesn't have anything else to really do. Doing anything else seems small and pointless after saving the world.  I also constatly update my character's look, changing her hair style, adjusting her face. i have plenty of modded armor/clothes so that the character always stays fresh and not boring. I also use Familiar Faces so i can keep making new characters that can be my current character's follower. I have a good bit of quest mods as well to do between bigger quest lines. I also have house/mansion mods which act as goals.  Some key things I've learned:   Don't start main quest. Use live another life and dont go near Helgen ever. Save all that for last Don't give yourself a big modded player home until you've become the DragonBorn and are well known. Don't give yourself nor buy a modest home until you've finished at least one two major quest lines (like the guild quest lines) Don't get married until sometime after you're dragonborn. Alternatively, don't give yourself a harem/bang maids too early either Do town/city quests in between major quest lines when they make sense and RP-wise, you're not supposed to be in a hurry. Don't do all the quests at once. Spread it out. Set conditions for your modded rewards, for example: ""I wont move into this house until I have at least 30,000gold and have completed this quest/questline"". Or ""I wont take part in this modded quest until I'm Dragonborn and i wont be dragonborn until I've done these questlines"". Or, ""I wont use my sex mods on this character until I'm the leader of this guild"" If you can help it, never have be on top or some kind of ruler or all powerful person. Otherwise, adventuring could seem pointless. Always have goals that are a long way away and you can keep enjoying Skyrim. Start out with the race, gender, and playstyle you love the most. As you max that style out, then you can start other play styles to level those up as well. Us UnCapper so you'll have plenty of perk points to spend, assuming you have a decent perk overhaul like PerMa.   Personally, my current character is mercenary type, only caring about money and is morally gray. She never turns down a chance for money and power. Right now, she's the new owner of ship after having become the thieves Guild leader. So now she's adventuring, looking for crew members to go out pirating. She has a few people from the guild on board, as well as NPCs she's already met through out travels. Gameplay consists of going out to do some pirating and then coming back and exploring skyrim for more Crew members (her RP reason for wanting to join the Companions and Mage college). Joining the DB and DG come naturally as vampire massacres are bad for everyone and assassination is a good chance to make money as network with people. Becoming thane ensures getting away with being a pirate because the Jarls are in her pocket. Doing general quests for money in order to pay for the ship's up keep and things like that. eventually, she'll travel to Hammerfell for more chances at power and wealth and more crew recruitment. Who knows where she'll head next."

skyrimmods,3e0bt8,Bridges85,2,Tue Jul 21 06:54:08 2015 UTC,"For me it's usually around level 20. My major guilty party comes in the fact that I'm bound by my own narratives more often than not, and I end up writing a cinematic headcanon as I go on that tends to revolve around singular concepts rather than the whole grey sprawl that is the Elder Scrolls. My lowborn peasant-turned-Knight of Solitude for example, once I finished the Civil War I didn't feel all that obligated to proceed. I also have a peculiar fondness for the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild quest lines but my overall favorite style of character is a sword and board, generally good warrior-merchant. The disconnect between ""lives"" is brutal.  [Edit]: I also find it ridiculous to become the head of certain organizations and then start in others and will sometimes let myself be led by the pace too much (I mean c'mon, some scenarios feel urgent even if ""The End of the World Comes on Your Schedule"") and then I end up being the Archmage of the College of Winterhold trying to prove myself to Brynjolf in the market place, etc. I end up giving Tolfdir the archmageship to fix that, I wish someone would make something similar for the Thieves Guild (Brynjolf?), Dark Brotherhodo (IDK, Cicero or Nazir?) and Companions (probably Vilkas.)  [Edit Edit]: Sorry I'm tired and just want to ramble. It also doesn't help that being a Nord in Skyrim appeals to me on numerous levels, and I never really feel appropriate doing a lot of the content as a relatively noble or traditional Nord warrior, but I want to DO the content (and a lot of quest mods that may not always be on the up and up) so blargle."

Your master files are in Overwrite, at the end of your mod list.  Place them back into your Skyrim\Data folder and then refresh Mod Organizer.  Either by restarting it or using the drop down button above the mod list.  Mod Organizer is throwing warnings.  These need to be resolved before you start the game.    Then you should take a look at this video segment and this post which describe how to manage your Mod List priority order, the left hand side of Mod Organizer, in an organized fashion.  Please read the entire thread that I linked.  It's important that the Master files and Unofficial patches have nothing above them in the Mod List priority order, left pane, and are in the same order as they are in the Load order, right pane, after you run LooT.  MO will give you a warning concerning a possible priority order problem when these are not managed.  Managing your Mod List Priority Order is as important as having LooT manage your load order.  It is a virtual installation order that you can manipulate in order to force the correct overwriting files you want to show up in the data tab, right side, which is the end result of your Mod List priority order. This freedom is just one of the bigger reasons why we use MO.  You can use my mod list as a reference for the folders being discussed in the thread I linked.

Some spells have scripts, which go in the script subfolder, some have unique art, which would go in the textures or meshes subfolders.

""Well if you REALLY wanted to use this music along with FSP you could always download both manually. Convert all the .xwm music files to something your computer could easily recognize like mp3, then listen to them all and decide which tracks you really want from each.  You can do just that with this: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8303/?  THEN you would need to use Personlized Music (the framework this mod is based on) to make your own personal list of all the music in these 2 mods: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13286/?  Then of course you would have to reconvert them back into .xwm and rename then appropriately according to the folders you put them in. It would be a long drawn out process, but it's totally worth it.  I've made my own custom soundtrack with the music in this mod as well as music from TONS of other sources Like the Lotr and Hobbit osts. Most of which would get me in trouble if I ever decided to upload it to the Nexus :/  EDIT: using Tes5edit WOULD be easier and less time consuming just realize that you would be overwriting music from one mod onto the other rather than actually combining the two."""

skyrimmods,3dwrh2,deanpmorrison,3,Mon Jul 20 09:11:50 2015 UTC,"Mad Companionship Spells MCS spells for short. This is a must have if you like playing with many different followers or decide you want to use a follower at any time. This lets you keep a list of all followers encountered, summon them at any time, teleport them to favourited locations, manage inventory and more. I use this alongside follower mods (set the followers to ""free"" after you summon them)  NPC visual override: This lets you replace the visual for any NPC in game with another including followers. Want to replace sofia with a chicken? Go for it. Personally I use it to replace vilja/sofia/arissa with another follower i love that I wished had her own personality/quest/lore.  Followers as Companions: Allows your follower to walk on your left or your right or have 2 followers walk on both sides at once. Great mod as your follower no longer trails behind you and instead journeys by your side.   Beyond Reach: My favourite DLC sized, New land mod. Adds a huge land with a complete quest line and very rewarding dungeouns. Voice acting is average at best but at least the world is beautiful and the journey it takes you on is very interesting with loads to do. I would put this up with Gray Cowl of Nocturne as second best quest mod.   Followers go on a trip: I have 20+ followers in my Skyrim. I don't want them to be stuck in taverns and inns waiting for me to pick them up. This mod allows them to go off and have their own adventures. They compete with you for bounties and misc quests. If they fail the quest, they get caught and have to be rescued from the bandits. Very fun mod and allows you to ""bump"" into your followers in the outside world. Use this mod with jaxon's markers to keep track of their location. Use MCS (above) to summon them if you need them immediately.  Player Size Adjuster: This allows you to adjust your player size through the MCM menu so that when you go back into first person the camera is appropriate for your size. (If you use the console to adjust height the FP camera stays at the same height regardless of how tall/small you made your character)  So I feel I use a lot of unconventional mods. Maybe you've heard of some of them. Others I'm sure you've never heard off. Regardless I wanted to share some of my  fav under appreciated mods that I have grown to love."
skyrimmods,3dwrh2,IrishChallenjour,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:17:04 2015 UTC,"Alright, you've piqued my interest - some questions  First, how's compatibility with EFF?  Second, Mad Companionship Spells sounds fantastic, but the website is impossible to read; what do I install?  Third, with followers going on trips, does it require them to have a default home, or is it compatible with My Home is Your Home?"
skyrimmods,3dwrh2,deanpmorrison,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:30:15 2015 UTC,"First, how's compatibility with EFF?  I'll assume you're talking about mad companionship spells. Yes this is 100% compatible, MCS works with ALL follower mods. After you use the MCS order spell on your follower set him/her to ""free"" and the EFF will take over when it comes to that follower's AI.  (You will still be able to summon your follower using the other spell, but you will have to set them to ""Free"" again if you want them to be under the control of EFF) I personally use AFT.   Second, Mad Companionship Spells sounds fantastic, but the website is impossible to read; what do I install?  I have uploaded which part of MCS I use to mediafire. I took this directly from my mod folder so I'm sure this is the one you use.  http://www.mediafire.com/download/b6lb75n1m0xkwke/MadCompanionshipSpellsInSkyrim_v1.5.zip  Third, with followers going on trips, does it require them to have a default home, or is it compatible with My Home is Your Home?  It's compatible with MHYM. It does not require them to have a home. If they have nothing to do they will return to their default home or wherever you set their home to be.   I hope I have answered your questions sufficiently. :)"

skyrimmods,3e0c7v,ChaosWolf1982,5,Mon Jul 20 23:52:14 2015 UTC,"You do know there are a ton of different CBBE and UNP shapes out there right? You can even make your own very easily with the program BodySlide (and really, if you're not willing to put in the effort yourself, no one else is going to be either).  If you hang up is ""big boobs are awful because no woman in the history of man has ever had big boobs"", there are a ton of bodies out there that have a super slim nearly flat 0 weight body to average breast size body. No one really works with the vanilla body because it doesn't that good.  Just use BodySlide if other people's bodies bother you that much. You can literally make any bodies you want. For example, i have a body that has a flat chest and very skinny 0 weight body. My 100 weight body has big breasts and is big everywhere else (thighs, legs, stomach, hips, arms, etc etc). This means that there are skinny, average, and big women in my game because the NPCs all range from 0 to 100 in size/scale so the game morphs their bodies in between those two shapes. With BodySlide you can then set vallina clothes and modded clothes to fit whatever body you create witht he click of a button.  As for male bodies, there are handful out there. Not many people pay much attention for very common sense based reasons. Most people playing this are straight males and straight females. Males are visual creatures and like looking women generally.you might not like it for whatever reason, but most guys do. These guys have no desire to make male content at the same rate as female content. Most guys don't care that much what their male character looks like or the very fine details of their body shapes. Women aren't as visual as men so they aren't going to work on male mods. many of the male mods you see are made by gay males. They are still visual creatures because they're still men so you see will always see skimpy male armor mods to go with male body replacers (SoS, SAM, Favored Soul, etc etc).   Anyway, for female bodies, bodyslide makes downloading bodies obsolete. You don't need to be tech savvy or super artistic to use it. Just have to know how to read (or watch a video) to learn it. Most people can figure it out just by opening the program and using it."
skyrimmods,3e0c7v,Jack_Hat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:14:34 2015 UTC,"I upvoted this because I agree completely. However, I'd like to add that regular UNP isn't at all extreme.

skyrimmods,3dywzv,uninspiringusername,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I just downloaded Unique Bows so I'll check it out, even though they all look the same. Better Bows is implemented into Immersive Weapons so I have all of those, and Nock to Tip looks like it changes too many aspects of archery. I'm just looking for additional types, not a reworking of the system, especially crafting since I just hit 100 smithing on my current character"
skyrimmods,3dywzv,jynx474,3,Mon Jul 20 20:32:20 2015 UTC,My personal Favorite is Real Bows
skyrimmods,3dywzv,Nazenn,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:18 2015 UTC,"I've seen this, but AFAIK it's just a model replacer for the vanilla bows, and I'm not interested in making them all look realistically wooden as I am having more diversity with the higher tier ones"
skyrimmods,3dywzv,Kofre,2,Mon Jul 20 20:30:37 2015 UTC,There is a standalone version as well. If you use WAFR or ACE I can supply a patch to make the standalone compatible with them which the author has these two files I offer and hasn't yet uploaded them.
skyrimmods,3dywzv,Kofre,2,Mon Jul 20 23:31:38 2015 UTC,"If you're like me and like to turn off the crosshair for immersion, scoped bows is awesome! http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50528/?"
skyrimmods,3dywzv,El_Monstero29,3,Mon Jul 20 18:12:35 2015 UTC,I've tried that but I really don't like the scopes and I think they take away from immersion because they feel more like Far Cry than Skyrim
skyrimmods,3dywzv,Kofre,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:06 2015 UTC,I think they do a good job of using materials for the scope that are appropriate to the bow in question.
skyrimmods,3dywzv,ZnCrow,3,Mon Jul 20 18:25:39 2015 UTC,I think it makes sense for the Dwemer bows but it looks and feels strange IMO on the other ones

skyrimmods,3dyc50,Axl-D,3,Mon Jul 20 15:12:15 2015 UTC,"I played for... ok, less than an hour last night... and didn't notice any problems. Yet. Ran through 3-4 ETAC cities but I didn't stick around very long.  I don't run JK's.   Someone else mentioned NPCs tend to sit in places where they shouldn't, but I didn't notice that myself. He said he'd be working on making his own patch.   I'm slightly concerned that if a patch comes out mid-playthrough that there would be a reason to not install it mid playthrough (i.e. Immersive Citizens is ok to install mid playthrough but you don't get all the features, would a patch have a similar issue?)  Oh, and with my current load order that initial load screen is loooooong. I CoC'd to Whiterun from the main menu and it took 9 minutes. CoC'ing to a cell with fewer people, or just starting the game normally (with ASLAL), took 4 min and less than two minutes respectively."
skyrimmods,3dyc50,Thallassa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:40 2015 UTC,"Why exactly are the load screen times that long? Has it been mentioned by Shurrah?   I'm also looking to test out Immersive Citizens AI later this week with ETAC... tho with someone that has a 230+ plugin mod-list, Im a bit nervous about these lengthy load times."
skyrimmods,3dyc50,Varno23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:00:08 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of a multiplicative effect with the other mods I run. The game is basically loading everything in the cell and trying to apply all the necessary packages/AI/scripts etc. to it. I think. So loading into a pretty big cell like whiterun has very long load screens.   Once you're actually in game the first time, subsequent stuff loads dynamically so it's not so bad. And as far as I can tell, once you've saved a game, a lot of that stuff is just baked into the save so it doesn't need to be recalculated/reloaded, so it's just the first save that's an issue."
skyrimmods,3dyc50,Thallassa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"ah that makes sense.  But on a related topic, would Immersive Citizens AI also apply to npcs in all cells? (even ones introduced by new-lands mods?) I know the mod author is still working to fully implement all features of the mod to all of Skyrim's towns. (beyond riverwood, whiterun, etc)  But what might happen, if anything, to npcs in new lands from mods such as Beyond Reach, Wyrmstooth and Beyond Skyrim: Bruma? Would there be any potential conflicts there?"
skyrimmods,3dyc50,Varno23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:16 2015 UTC,"That, I don't know. I think any NPC that uses the vanilla packages that are edited by IC-AI would have the changes. If IC-AI adds new packages, those won't be used. And if the New Lands NPCs uses entirely non-vanilla packages, those won't be used. No conflict, just inconsistency in what is done."
skyrimmods,3dyc50,Thallassa,3,Mon Jul 20 20:44:53 2015 UTC,"You get NPCs walking into walls, sitting inside chairs but you also get that in vanilla so (well the wall bug anyway).   The only funny bug I noticed was once in a tavern everyone was bunched near the entrance for some baffling reason. But I think an update fixed that because I haven't seen it again."
skyrimmods,3dyc50,Ryzaki009,2,Mon Jul 20 15:53:01 2015 UTC,"I used to get that same tavern entrance bug a lot, and I've never installed immersive citizens. It generally happens when it's morning time and you have a mod that adds a lot of NPCs (because ""homeless"" NPCs tend to go to taverns at night). Then they get stuck trying to get past each other to go through the door to go to ""work"" or whatever. Sometimes it's a navmesh issue, sometimes two NPCs decide to strike up a conversation right in front of the doorway, sometimes they just all spawn at the door when you load a save and they don't know what to do. What can you do."
skyrimmods,3dyc50,AlcyoneNight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:34:45 2015 UTC,Oh I see thanks. That was pretty funny though. Poor Skyrim's brain popping at too many NPCs.
skyrimmods,3dyc50,Ryzaki009,3,Tue Jul 21 04:20:05 2015 UTC,"Navmesh and activity markers are the problem. JK adds items that get in the way of navmesh, so NPCs will walk into things without understanding why. ETaC moves certain statics, making characters sit on air instead of stumps sometimes.  I may be wrong, but the main conflicts are Whiterun and Riverwood at the moment because that's where the relax state AI is built at the moment for ICAO."

skyrimmods,3dwg78,ThePharros,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:03:15 2015 UTC,Becoming an archon from Diablo and lazering people with arcane magic would be absolutely amazing. As op said you could use vampire lord as a base and change up the lightning master a bit. Time to start learning how to mod...
skyrimmods,3dwg78,EuphoricKnave,13,Mon Jul 20 19:06:23 2015 UTC,"Sounds like Augur of Dunlain, from the College of Winterhold's basement. It's not clear what he is, but the prevailing theory among fans are that he went through some kind of apotheosis. If we consider that true, it's not a good path for player character to follow.  The alternative transformation, more lore&game friendly is to become a lich. I've heard the quest mod Undeath allows you this transformation, but I've also heard it's not very good.   I think there's 3 paths for advanced mages: 1) Apotheosis, not a good thing to happen in a game and quite hard to happen lorewise (the Altmers, as a race, is trying to archive this); 2) Lichdom, some necromancers go through this path, it's like Vampirism but worse for you can't disguise yourself (at least it's not heard of any lich living among humans, but that might be just their decision, not limitation of their state); and 3) None of the above, the most prominent example of this path is the Fyr mage from Morrowind. He's about 3000 years old IIRC and is one of the most knowledgeable and powerful character along with Dagoth and Vivec.  To be honest, if I were an archmage I would choose the 3rd path. Why would I want to become something else like Vampires and Werewolfs? I have my magic to do whatever these creatures do and do it better. Apotheosis is cool in theory but from what I see on the Almsivi doesn't look very fun. Might as well keep feeding my unending curiosity as mere mortal in my own pocket dimension with nigh immortality."
skyrimmods,3dwg78,sorenant,5,Mon Jul 20 05:00:24 2015 UTC,"Someone else pointed out Ehlnofeys.  Maybe one could lend you some of it's power? I don't think there is much lore surrounding them so we could easily have a bit of freedom with it. Look at the picture, it's a striking resemblance."
skyrimmods,3dwg78,DeadKrow,2,Mon Jul 20 08:31:34 2015 UTC,Plus thats an elnofey embodying water. Imagine light beings or wind or even of the arcane itself. OR THE VOID. That'd be badass (and technically neither good nor evil)
skyrimmods,3dwg78,Cadenas,2,Tue Jul 21 02:17:31 2015 UTC,"Lichdom, some necromancers go through this path, it's like Vampirism but worse for you can't disguise yourself   That doesn't apply to Mannimarco though. It would be an interesting mechanic to have the player spend magicka on an illusion spell (or wear an enchantment) in order to enter settlements without getting attacked. Does Undeath already do this though?"
skyrimmods,3dwg78,sorenant,3,Mon Jul 20 16:58:21 2015 UTC,"Mannimarco is an outstanding necromancer, we can't use him as standard.  Not much is known about the nature of Liches but I don't think it's wrong to say they are capable of disguising themselves with magic, they're advanced wizards after all. Just mind you that as there is necromancers working on these kind of illusion magic, there is also wizards working on counter measures.  About the Lich on Undead, I don't know much but it seems to be just an ordinary transformation like Werewolf, but you become a blue dragon priest (lich) that uses predetermined magic. I'd say unless you transform in the middle of the city, no one will notice you're different."
skyrimmods,3dwg78,saric92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yup. It's an ordinary transformation as you said. It takes the place of the vamp lord/werewolf transformation, so you can't be either if you choose to do undeath."

Or maybe an Ehlnofey could give you a small portion of it's power since I imagine an actual Ehlnofey would be quite powerful.  Here's the Guardian of the Water, an Ehlnofey from ESO, has almost a perfect resemblance to what I was thinking about!"
skyrimmods,3dwg78,furiousdeath7,6,Mon Jul 20 08:26:55 2015 UTC,I like this idea. There's are mods related to magic that have pictures similar to the ones you showed off. It would be interesting for the player to be able to transform into something with a similar look. The mods i'm talking about are Aetherius Magic and Spectraverse.  These are links to pictures from the mods to show what i'm talking about.  Aetherius Magic.  Spectraverse. Another.

skyrimmods,3dwg78,2bf1x,2,Mon Jul 20 08:34:10 2015 UTC,"That's the very one, give it a try, Andromedas cool.  Also do a search for fairies of Skyrim, might be of help as well if your looking for floaty light being/things."

skyrimmods,3dwg78,ThePharros,3,Mon Jul 20 04:31:36 2015 UTC,"The problem with werewolves is that they aren't very fitting for a mage, too visceral."
skyrimmods,3dwg78,xDialtone,3,Mon Jul 20 08:39:20 2015 UTC,what about something like this http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32234/?  i mean you play as dragonborn it's entirely possible the dragonborn has more powers we don't know about yet being of dragonblood is a  gift from Akatosh himself the amazing powers you could have could be endless I also feels like it's alittle lore friendly I havent tried it myself but from the pictures the model could be a bit better IMO.  EDIT  Theres also something like druid playstyle http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37665/? its more mage related than less aquire a transformation power but would eventually let you transform into stuff like a bear etc cause your a druid.
skyrimmods,3dwg78,tempest420,3,Mon Jul 20 09:34:06 2015 UTC,"The dragon one is very related to being dragonborn, and isn't very mage-like.  I knew about the druid one and while it's good for a druid character, not very good for non-druid characters."
skyrimmods,3dwg78,saris01,2,Mon Jul 20 09:48:00 2015 UTC,"The Dragon Lord looks too sinister in my opinion, and it also doesn't really have the spiritual/supernatural feel that the OP was asking for.

skyrimmods,3dwg78,tempest420,2,Mon Jul 20 19:16:25 2015 UTC,well he asked for a total transformation like wherewolf or vampire lord but for a good character not an evil one. That just makes the shout grow wings.

skyrimmods,3dwg78,Liberi_Fatales,2,Mon Jul 20 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting idea. First thought that comes to mind for me would be the Archons from Starcraft 1/2.  Using the Vampire Lord as a base could lead to some interesting play. Perhaps instead of having the on-demand switch between hovering/ magic and on ground/melee, the melee on ground state would be when you're out of mana, or recovering from spell use. After a cooldown, you're back into floating doom mode."

skyrimmods,3dwg78,commanche105996,2,Mon Jul 20 16:47:46 2015 UTC,"There are a couple druid transformation mods.  I don't think it's what you're looking for, but it's the closest ""good"" transformation I can think of.    Vampire lord and werewolf doesn't necessarily need to be evil.  There can be good vampires, right?  What if they only feed on evil people?  Either way, most traditional transformations have been in evil in nature, either to gain more power, live longer, or both.  Necromancers want to become a lich and break the laws of life and death.  You would think good-natured people wouldn't feel the need to go through the transformation because they don't need more power or life."
skyrimmods,3dwg78,Liberi_Fatales,2,Mon Jul 20 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"It's true that vampires don't necessarily have to be evil, but the vampire lord form certainly looks evil and savage, and werewolves definitely look savage.

They add loads of equipment to craft and if you have all the smithing perks you see all of them.  So, no there is no fix but if you have skyui ver5 it gives a useful menu that shows items you can craft first."
skyrimmods,3e05bk,offendedc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:18:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it does show those first, which helps. I love the SkyUI menu everywhere else but I miss things being separated by their ingredient type. It would at least be nice to have them separated from each other by weapon and armor and such. Especially when you have a TON of crafting materials on you."

skyrimmods,3e05bk,ChaosWolf1982,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:29:46 2015 UTC,"A big problem with IA/IW is rather than assign a material type for each of the weapons/armors (possibly by basing it on the item used to temper/improve it, thus things like the Paladin Armor set would classify as Ebony, for example), it's all dumped into an ""Auxiliary Items"" category, which is read as ""Other"" by SkyUI, so even if you sort by Material, it's still a huge mess.  This is a HUGE oversight on the part of hothtrooper44 when he created the Immersive mods."
skyrimmods,3e05bk,myztikrice,2,Mon Jul 20 23:38:18 2015 UTC,Not really an oversight not making his mod compatible with an arbitrary design decision made by people he didn't know would be making that decision 2 years later

This is an album I made with the same place at the same time-ish with the different combinations.  If you want vanilla friendly, RS + ELE Lite Interiors only (IL) is the best bet.  Some say that that RS + ELE Lite (full) is the most realistic. Honestly, it's the most realistic in placement of the lights, but not color (depending on ENB.)  ELFX + Enhancer and ELFX + ELE Lite (full) are the most realistic in lighting color and the most cinematic in placement.

I care not for up votes, and I'd prefer any potential Reddit gold go to someone who would make use of it. The user whose thread I inadvertently hijacked for example. Or yourself even.  I just don't have the drive. I mean, I've been talking about getting into game modding for a few years. Writing for far longer. But I have done some writing. Completed a few short stories. Have nearly a novel and most of another in my head.  But this weekend has inspired me. I will look into some modding tutorials. I'm just out of town for work, don't have time to look into it now. Figured I might get a head start if someone knows a specific great guide or YouTuber to get started with. If not, no big deal."

Most people (and I don't mean you specifically here,) who post ideas how no clue how to make mods, so often the ideas are just impossible, impractical, ludicrous or require a team of modmakers the size of the actual team that worked on Skyrim. Hell, they have no way of knowing this because they just write stuff without any idea how to make it. The best writers know what is possible, have a general understanding of HOW it's done, and can judge the workload. Otherwise you're just writing fan-fiction.    Completely offtopic:  http://atmora-calling.freeforums.net/  Looking for a writer."

You had few years to improve, and you still are vague on the, crucial to your idea, how could I call it - inter-guild hostilities. This part is non-trivial, since Skyrim is fully voiced."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,simtam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:06:07 2015 UTC,"Interesting reply. You say I've had a few years to refine my ideas. That's true, but I didn't think about it much between then and now. The guild stuff was added last week. I have not say down and planned how the guild stuff would change. I'll allow the idea is not well planned and structured."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,simtam,2,Mon Jul 20 08:42:57 2015 UTC,"There's a reason why we don't see much mods changing e.g. guild questlines - as soon as you change/extend a line spoken by an NPC, you face a dilemma: revoice all NPC's lines or dialogues, or allow VA inconsistency.  I think the core of what you wrote is a recurring enemy random encounter, which is non-lethal (tentatively you can enable one of ""no death mod"" to such an effect), and the ""firepower"" of the enemy scales with the in-game time since the beginning of the game. This is a good idea for start, and later a modder can expand on it to make it even better."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,Teremol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed — and, really, the guild stuff is an expansion on the original idea. Do a CTRL+F ""Dogmeat"" and see where I got the idea. In a nutshell, I pissed off Dogmeat in Fallout 3 and he stalked me for the rest of the game. I'd get away but he'd eventually come back and attack. It kept me guessing, and on alert. It improved the experience, even if it broke canon."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,ThePharros,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, but there's a huge leap between the Dogmeat scenario and what is the full vision of yours. Between these two, there could be all kind of Slenderman mods and somesuch. Nevertheless, by positioning yourself ""I am not a modder"" you are not in control of what idea is going to be implemented."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,JT91733,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:01:08 2015 UTC,"Fully aware of both points. Just throwing it out there. I would not be bothered if the mod got made and I was not credited. I'd be more bothered if I didn't know about it. I'd rather play it than be known as the guy who came up with it.  I agree it's a huge leap. I believe the further we get from a great idea, we risk a greater overall idea, but we also risk absurdity. I think if we polled Skyrim gamers, the idea of a nemesis/rival, at its core, would be highly regarded. The more ideas that get tacked on, the more people will say, ""No, that's not something I want in my game."" Some ideas should stay simple."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,EpitomyofShyness,2,Tue Jul 21 05:56:21 2015 UTC,"Or the nemesis might steal your horse if you left it unattended and leave a mocking note in its place. There's a lot of these little ideas, which should not be really discussed publicly in order to not spoil it. Why don't you take some action? If you don't want to mod yourself, gather those various ideas, write them up a design of this mod, seek someone who will implement it."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,EpitomyofShyness,9,Tue Jul 21 15:39:15 2015 UTC,It's ideas like this that make me wish I was smart enough to learn how to mod stuff in Skyrim properly.

skyrimmods,3dvo6l,Mattiewagg,-3,Mon Jul 20 00:49:17 2015 UTC,Same. But I know my strengths and weaknesses. Ideas are my strong suit.
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,lojunqueira,5,Mon Jul 20 03:35:57 2015 UTC,"YouTube will teach you,"
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,notmicelf,6,Mon Jul 20 03:51:57 2015 UTC,"If this became a mod I'd devote at least one or two playthroughs to it, since based on what I'm seeing it would probably have incompatibilities out the wazoo. But it would be worth devoting at 1 or 2 playthroughs to, its totally awesome.  I'd argue that it should be made customizable in an MCM menu, like you could have a setting so that the player can decide if their wife/kids can be killed or not, that way you aren't completely shutting out players who aren't comfortable with that. Its totally awesome though."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,scorpiousdelectus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:02:45 2015 UTC,"It would be sure to be incompatible with many gameplay mods. But the good thing about that is, with Mod Organizer, my understanding is that you can have multiple mod loadouts and independent saves, so you could play a game with mods A, B, C, D, F, J, and K, save, quit, and then with minimal effort, load up a game running mods A, C, D, E, G, H, and J, with no issues.  I'm aware of MCM, but if it were up to me, it wouldn't be configurable. I mean, it would be part of the story. I'm all for customization in many mods, and I'd consider making the level scaling customizable, since that was a big sticking point with a lot of people. Maybe customize the severity of the random attacks, such as limiting cheap shots, make her always engage you in conversation before fighting. I just love the idea of an NPC doing to you (and me) what we do to bandits."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,notmicelf,2,Mon Jul 20 03:42:33 2015 UTC,"I understand that you have a particular vision for the way it would work, but the benefits to having a MCM which allows players to adjust various settings means that each player can craft the experience that they want. I mean I know that this all sounds really cool, but there are a variety of things that really don't appeal to me, and an MCM menu would make it so I could enjoy the pieces that sound amazing while discarding the pieces that for me do not."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,MasterRonin,5,Mon Jul 20 08:41:11 2015 UTC,"This sounds completely amazing. I would fund this, if it was to be developed. Voice acting would make this mod legendary as well."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,Brittnye,2,Mon Jul 20 01:33:10 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, it would absolutely need to be voiced. Laura Bailey would be my first choice for the female human or Elven nemesis, too bad she's already Serana. But I'm thinking more Lust from Fullmetal Alchemist where her voice is more sultry. She has a wide range. For a guy, I don't know. Someone who can do dark and creepy, but remember, they'd have to be a hero if you go villain."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,TheChurchofHelix,3,Mon Jul 20 03:45:41 2015 UTC,"You rarely get to choose VAs out of mods, esp. professional ones, though you can get some.  Also, AFAIK, VAs working for Skyrim can't do anything else for mods of it. A VA from Oblivion wanted to help BS: Cyrodiil but said he couldn't contractually."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,Zagaroth,0,Mon Jul 20 07:27:23 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, I know. I mean, I knew you can't pick and choose, not without a good deal of clout. The contract stuff I was unaware of. That is unfortunate. Honestly there is a lot of great talent out there. Not sure if gaming is seeing a huge rise in voice acting, but anime is as English audio tracks come in higher demand, for example Tokyo Ghoul got its second season dubbed before the first, because between the two, the studio realized that the demand for the English translation was so great that they couldn't afford to alienate English speakers for as long. I'd love to hear Caitlin Glass, Monica Rial, or Cherami Leigh in a Bethesda game. Pretty sure they haven't yet. (And now we're much closer to the end of voice actors I can name, LOL — my wife can probably name dozens.)"
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,Trippie6,2,Mon Jul 20 08:48:42 2015 UTC,"Well.... there was a huge rise in games VA over the last few years, at least in AAA production.    Dedicated game VAs are getting similar recognition to (small) movie stars (Troy Baker and Jen Hale come to mind) Popular VAs from other media are doing games (Kevin Conroy and Mark Hammil on the Arkham Series) Man... there are actual legends doing VA in games (Just in the TES series you can find Pat Stewart, Chris Plummer and John fraking Cleese... unfortunately Bethesda doesn't make a very good use of them :X )"
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,psychoslovakian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:09:56 2015 UTC,So I guess it would make sense to have 4 voice actors. A male and a female voice actor for hero and villain.

skyrimmods,3dvo6l,ItsTheGreen1,7,Mon Jul 20 02:31:07 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of scripting for something like that. But it sounds like you'd get pigeonholed into either being good or bad. The Thieves Guild may answer to Nocturnal in a vague sense but they arent inherently evil. With the Dark Brotherhood the initial quest starts out somewhat neutral. Horrible woman, hungry kids, and a kind hearted backup matron waiting in the wings. What good leaning character wouldnt want to save the children?  It's an interesting idea but TES plays pretty hard into the whole morally ambiguous thing. Not sure howd you work it to not be."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,ItsTheGreen1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:05:29 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that both guilds are evil as they exist to hurt people. You've got the lore on your side and you aren't wrong. Even Emperor Titus Mede II agrees, seeing the Dark Brotherhood as necessary, even sacrificing his own life, more or less giving in to fate.  Dark Brotherhood targets being bad people doesn't change the moral compass of the guild — whatever the latter may be, would you agree with that statement? I mean, yeah Grelod is absolutely a walking bag of shit. Alain DuFont isn't innocent, either. Most of the rest can go either way. Even the vampire lumberjacks aren't hurting anyone, they just happen to be vampires, and they will happily sell you lumber if you have Hearthfire installed.  Good or evil I always kill Grelod. Plus that child abusing piece of shit in Rorikstead, Lemkil. Actually that isn't known for sure, I think, but in my game I judge him guilty and execute him every time. I gladly orphan his kids because that immediately stops the older one abusing the younger one or trying to get others to abuse her. It's a really sad back story. Lemkil's wife died giving birth to his second daughter, and both father and older sister never let her forget it, and they torment her day and night for it. I actually wish there was a quest for it. It would end in either killing Lemkil, or finding him a mate. Ysolda might be a good candidate as the Khajiit traders she loves probably pass through Rorikstead, and she could set up a shop there. I don't think Rorikstead has a general store. Anyway, that's a whole other mod idea."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,Eruntien,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:30:26 2015 UTC,"While it is fully possible to be a Chaotic Good assassin or thief - its also possible to be a Lawful Evil ranger or scholar. I don't think of it in terms of good and evil - those are two ideas that require perspective - instead I think of it in terms of law and chaos. Either you follow the law of the land, or you don't. It doesn't matter why you do what you do, it matters what you do. Killing Grelod is good, but eating people as a werewolf certainly isn't. Isran is a Lawful Good paladin who would happily commit genocide against the vampires, whereas the vampire lord in Volkihar (whose name escapes me) is a Lawful Evil jarl-equivalent who would happily subjugate the world to his family.  My gist is that, while you may play as a rule-breaker, your titular nemesis may become a bastion of the law to bring you to justice. If you play as a bastion of the law, then your nemesis may become a rule-breaker to topple your rule. This mod doesn't have to be diecast into black and white, just as your character is not diecast."
skyrimmods,3dvo6l,saris01,4,Mon Jul 20 04:12:33 2015 UTC,"I gotta admit, while over all i like this, the two things that bug me is that   A) your first encounter has a fixed outcome (seriously, you have no idea how much it bugs me that there is no way to not get hit by Karlilah's arrow, not even a Slow time + whirlwind sprint combo will get you 'out of the way' fast enough for her to shoot at mercer instead, and there's no way to knock him into the room in front of you)   and B) that all the following encounters are initiated by your opposite as well, no way to hunt her instead during the build up to the guild clash.  Also, if you want such a perfect opposite, you should have opposite sides during the dawnguard quest as well (either way you take kills the vampire lord off, but she's in the opposite side and flees at an appropriate time)"

skyrimmods,3dzku4,fadingsignal,2,Mon Jul 20 22:41:13 2015 UTC,"There's The Sinister Sever which adds 7 different assassins and their minions after you.

Not only does it improve the original stats it also has a few lore friendly replacements (thane items mainly) and additions.    EDIT: That's not all, it also adds pseudo quests that happen for some of the new items, a good example of this is the Blade of Woe Improved (contains spoilers) which includes a new set of Dark Brotherhood themed items that can be acquired in one of two ways depending on your choice to either join or destroy them."
skyrimmods,3dyjxv,rush247,3,Mon Jul 20 16:46:01 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of unique Thane weapons, but they're pretty overpowered here, IMO. Dovadaan (Whiterun) in particular - getting a Nord Hero Greatsword that deals an extra 50% damage to dragons and ignores 50% of armor that early on is pretty ridiculous."
skyrimmods,3dyjxv,Sinistas,2,Mon Jul 20 17:18:18 2015 UTC,True but you can easily rebalance the scales by getting Deadly Dragons or something similar.

skyrimmods,3dw92x,EnaiSiaion,9,Mon Jul 20 01:34:26 2015 UTC,If you used SKSE you could allow players to get free perks through the perk tree menu without having to work through a refund.  If you used SKSE you could change pickpocket to go off weight cutoffs instead of random RNG.  IF YOU USED SKSE  IF YOU USED SKSE  IF YOU USED SKSE
skyrimmods,3dw92x,Grimy_Bunyip,5,Mon Jul 20 02:03:33 2015 UTC,"If you used SKSE you could allow players to get free perks through the perk tree menu without having to work through a refund.   You can give people free perks without SKSE. However this doesn't help me because the whole point is that you have to do something to get your free perks (pay gold, find a token, open a master lock in 15 seconds). SKSE wouldn't help in any way.   If you used SKSE you could change pickpocket to go off weight cutoffs instead of random RNG.   And if you prefer to do it without SKSE, know that pickpocket chance is already based on weight, so one could just crank up that multiplier until the curve becomes a wall. Something like a base 10000% chance to pickpocket, reduced by 2500% per kilogram would do it.  But that doesn't actually add any challenge to pickpocketing, it merely removes randomness. At which point, why not just let the player pickpocket anything with 99% certainty after 3 perk points?  The problem with vanilla pickpocketing failure rate and save scumming is that save scumming is entirely justified because there is no realistic way to make the problem go away because the cap is only 90%, meaning statistically the best cutpurse in the world has 41% chance to get busted pickpocketing some beggar's 5 measly items and lose all stolen swag for a 25 gold bounty. But when there is a way to solve the problem, not doing so becomes genuine cheating.  (I forgot to mention that I increased the pickpocket cap to 99%. Sorry.)   IF YOU USED SKSE  IF YOU USED SKSE  IF YOU USED SKSE   Some things require SKSE (manipulation of spell and item stats). In most other cases, there are other ways to do the same thing. So what if I need SKSE for one or two perks? I can do 700 perks without SKSE.  Also, I refused to rely on third party code in the past, with a total conversion for another game. Then a surprise patch was dropped upon the community a few years after release when everyone who developed said third party code had already quit. Other mods now had to tell the users to uninstall, get out their shiny discs and reinstall up to the previous patch. They sort of disappeared after that while a Blizzard employee praised mine in an interview. So no, I will not rely on SKSE for anything important.  NEWBIE EXPERIENCE  NEWBIE EXPERIENCE  NEWBIE EXPERIENCE"
skyrimmods,3dw92x,Grimy_Bunyip,3,Mon Jul 20 10:25:58 2015 UTC,"Those aren't the only two things you're sacrificing for SKSE and you know it.  You're making hundreds of perks, that's hundred lost opportunities to implement new features and streamline/improve existing ones.  Newbie Experience? How old is this game now? Maybe this made sense years ago. But at some point you gotta move forward."
skyrimmods,3dw92x,Grimy_Bunyip,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:51:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, SKSE is not really something that helps you make better perks. You can change gamesettings using SKSE, meaning a ton of perks become viable... but those are not interesting perks. Those are just more variations of ""makes your character better in some way"". I much prefer perks that do something, and SKSE doesn't help much with that.  Off the top of my head, the only thing I wanted to do and couldn't do was make Iced Earth and Conflagration damage scale with the damage of the spell you cast. Then I added World in Flames and it became unnecessary.  I just rebalanced all of the sneak values btw and there are a number of skills to determine how well you are doing while sneaking. Sneaking is now much more realistic in that visual and sound cues are far more important than sneak skill, and the RED SPY IN THE BASE phase lasts much longer. No more wind arrows in the face. To compensate for the fact that you can now actually get detected if you walk in front of the enemy's nose, there are perks that reward you for staying undetected."
skyrimmods,3dw92x,Grimy_Bunyip,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"Subjectively, we could argue how much SKSE helps all day long. Which I suspect would just boil down to me suggesting implementations, and you suggesting alternative ways of doing that which inevitably end up having fewer features, using more condition functions, and or being script heavier.  But as far as I'm concerned, the most basic use for SKSE on perks is editing perk entry values, allowing you to cut down on condition functions is worth it, regardless of the addition of new gameplay."

Overall just some great and really unique perks once again. This is actually shaping up to potentially be my favorite perk overhaul.

Simply overwriting your perks onto skyre's would not be the best idea correct?   Best of luck finishing everything up and thanks for all your hard work.   Edit: Now that I've read through all of these in detail the pickpocket tree looks fantastic the coin mechanic is very unique I only hope that if I somehow lose it that there is a fail-safe for retrieving it. The lockpicking tree looks fun, I've never been a fan of bear traps but I'm sure someone is so thats fine the rest of the tree is still solid.

Also not endorsed by some mod authors who add their mods included without being asked.  In my opinion, that pack denies authors of the deserved recognition they get from people visiting the modpage, endorsing, and even donating. It tramples any kind of intelectual property rights - just because it's free it doesn't mean there are no restrictions on its use.  I hope you understand why I am refusing to help you. I sugest you try a curated modlist (like STEP), try to do it yourself, or ask for help from this subreddit."

skyrimmods,3dxsap,Thallassa,3,Mon Jul 20 15:03:51 2015 UTC,"Redistributing other people's work without permission is considered theft. Big mod packs that claim to entirely re-do your entire experience with 400+ mods are, without exception, redistributing work without permission.   Therefore, any post promising to do that is promptly removed.   Following STEP's guide will get you most of the way there with less effort than finding all the mods yourself.   However, if you really want to overhaul Skyrim, I recommend picking out mods you like yourself. It's far too easy to get over 400 mods anyways :P (And to do so legally!)."
skyrimmods,3dxsap,Thallassa,-3,Mon Jul 20 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really call it redistributing. I don't really see why people have a problem with people using other people's work to make a big collection of things, so long as they give credit of course, which the person I'm talking about did. And tbh, I wasn't planning on installing the actual mod pack, I was just going to pick out some mods from the guy's list that I liked the sounds of and install them myself.

skyrimmods,3dxsap,lojunqueira,3,Mon Jul 20 15:17:47 2015 UTC,"It is redistribution if the mod's files are included in the pack. That's pretty much the definition of redistribution. It's possible you and I aren't thinking of the same case and yours was simply a list, not a pack, in which case it would be ok.   Mod authors put a lot of work into making these awesome things for us. In return, many of them expect some degree of control over the things they make. Given that they aren't ok with redistribution, it is to all our benefit to prevent that. Because otherwise you end up with situations where, because you have no idea where or who or what happened to your mod, it seems safest to just take the mod down. And then nobody has it.   For a big list of mods to pick and choose from, I like looking at other people's modlists. Modwatch's beta lets you search by mod.   Skyrim GEMs and STEP are also quite good for that."

I would shoot for 8-10 in that setting.  quoted from MTichenor/ 'IndigoNeko', the author of SkyRealism - Time and Travel, he states:  "" I suppose if you've never played through the entire game with a 20:1 ratio, then you wouldn't notice it. The two main areas that you'll immediately see the difference are solitude and riverwood, which is why I have them in my exclusion list. If you're using 1:1 ratio, in Riverwood, if you do the Golden Claw quest line, Lucien's sister will take forever to get through her dialogue and eventually walk to the bridge. In Solitude, the execution scene goes through normally, but the people stand around for a good half hour, staring at Rogvir's corpse, when they're supposed to wander off 1 by 1 over the course of a minute or so. The reason I set it to 6 is because if an NPC needs to go through a door or entrance and it's being used or someone is in the way, they have a small in-game delay. At 20:1 it's only 1 or 2 seconds, but when you've got it at 1:1, they'll stand around for 20-40 seconds before they try going through a door again. When I put it at 6 seconds, they'll go through the door in about 4-6 seconds or so, which doesn't feel too unnatural. A good example of this is the quest to kill the dragon out front of whiterun, when the four guardsmen follow Irilith outside. At 1:1, it takes them nearly 3 minutes to all individually file out, whereas with a 20:1 ratio they get out in about 10 seconds."""

Changes: I stopped using mods that are ""broken"" no matter how tempting they were. So no Skybirds, turn locational damage off in the MCM for Deadly Combat. Basically that's it.   I have a better computer. My old computer could run my load order, but it's sluggish. New computer is much more stable. Probably it's mostly not the computer but it's a factor.   Finally, I learned to use TES5edit. Not just make a merged patch, but really use. I checked my entire load order for conflicts. Then I reordered by hand to minimize conflicts. Anything that couldn't be fixed by reordering, I made a new patch for by hand.   So far my game seems pretty rock solid. No slowdowns, no crashes, Carlotta and Ysolda will give me their quests, etc. I haven't tested thoroughly yet and I added some more mods which didn't get properly checked in TES5edit (because  laziness), but it works.   Oh, and something which a lot of people don't do which I've been doing all along: If a mod is incompatible with my load order, I don't download it. If I think I might use it later in a different load order, I track it on the nexus so I can find it again, but I do not download it.

If so, did you install the right version of the ENB for those lighting mods?  From the FAQ :   ""What setting or level should i use for in-game brightness?"" in step 1 i've told you to set fGamma=1.2400 in SkyrimPrefs.ini, this is the in-game brightess PureVision is optimized for! Don't touch the in-game brightness after setting this.  Those black bars are called letterboxing, and it's an option in the installer.  If you don't want to re-run it, open enbeffect.fx and change ""#define USE_LETTERBOX_EFFECT"" from 1 to 0. That's too vague of a problem, and we don't care what Steam says about your FPS.  Press * on your numpad to show ENB's FPS counter to see if it matches up.  If it's OVER 60, your problem might be that the physics engine is acting up."

The first things i can think of are mods that adds more realistic needs much like in Fallout New Vegas hardcore mode.  This list covers most mods that is about survival and needs  And ofcourse, classic Fallout gore ;) Deadly Mutilation - dismemberment blood and gore"
skyrimmods,3dvevv,lojunqueira,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:23:18 2015 UTC,"This. How is the important question. They pretty much feel like the same game in terms of core mechanics. Similar stat/skill/perk rpg progression system attached to an open-world action game, one being more shooty and the other more swordy.  The only significant diference I can think of is that Fallout has a ""less but better"" design for the perk system (less perks, but bigger effects). Some perk mods like SPERG have the same design philosophy, you get 1 perk/2 lvls but they are more powerfull.  New Vegas has some extra stuff like the harcore mode mentioned above and the more interesting faction system.  Btw... there's only one Bethesda FO game!!"

Your adapter properties where? 5538 what - is this measured in MB? 5538 is a very strange amount for RAM or VRAM - I don't think that is what you want.  Is this ""speedhackwithoutgraphics"" setting required - what does it tell you to do? Read the beginners guide closely, make sure you don't miss any vital parts."
skyrimmods,3dw232,Foolski,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:17:27 2015 UTC,"the beginners guide says to change it to true... I was doing it step by step.  GPU is R9 270. Unless I'm mistaken the guide said to open the adapter properties and use total available graphics memory, which is 5888MB for me. Dedicated video memory says 2048mb. I also tried setting the video memory to 2000, and didn't work."
skyrimmods,3dw232,Foolski,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:26:39 2015 UTC,"Ok, 5888MB isn't a thing because it doesn't round off to a number of GB. Your card has 2048MB aka 2GB VRAM. Please link the guide and point out the part you mean and if someone else hasn't solved your problem I'll talk to you tomorrow (it's late)."
skyrimmods,3dw232,Foolski,2,Mon Jul 20 02:44:41 2015 UTC,"Here's the link the section in the beginner guide. It links to here on how to edit the ini file. Where it says ""(Total Available Graphics Memory − [170 (for Win7) or 350 (for Win8+)])."" for video memory. And following what it said on how to find total available graphics memory: ""To find Dedicated Video Memory and Total Available Graphics Memory in Windows 7 and 8:  Right-click the Desktop and click [Adjust screen resolution]. In the middle and right-hand side of the window, click the [Advanced settings] link. In the new window that opens, make sure the [Adapter] tab is the current tab. Under Adapter Information, Dedicated Video Memory and Total Available Graphics Memory are listed. ""   it showed my total available graphics memory as 5888 and I subtracted 350, like it said, and got 5358.  Also doesn't work if I put 2048, or just leave the defaults."
skyrimmods,3dw232,Foolski,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:52:36 2015 UTC,"Ok.  How much actual RAM do you have as well as VRAM? Is your system 32 or 64 bit?  Have you tried 4096? Since you have a 2GB card and clearly enough RAM, 4096 should be ok.  It also says to not subtract the value, so don't subtract 170 for Win7 or 350 for Win8.  It also says:   If AutodetectVideoMemorySize is enabled below, this parameter is ignored. All values are in megabytes.   Try turning that on, it will ignore whatever is in VideoMemorySizeMb.  Also make sure you're tying it in correctly if doing it manually it should look like:   VideoMemorySizeMb= 4096   So all one word, a space, then amount. Make sure any fields you've edited are correct. It may in fact be something else that  has an issue as well.  Report back!"
skyrimmods,3dw232,Foolski,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:58:22 2015 UTC,"Well I already tried setting it as regular 2048 and now I tried autodetect but it still doesn't start.   Are you sure about putting a space between = and the number? In the file everything has no space, even in other ini files."
skyrimmods,3dw232,calgy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:57:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry yes no space, I was confused with something else.  When you say it doesn't start in what way doesn't it start? Are you sure you've installed everything else correctly?  Have you watched this video?"
skyrimmods,3dttrm,Mikeahya,6,Sun Jul 19 12:00:49 2015 UTC,"Script heavy saves do not corrupt over time necessarily, and hardware has nothing to do with your save files.   However most scripts apply as you encounter things in the game. The scripts are supposed to be removed when you leave those things. But bad mods, don't remove the scripts. So suddenly you have a game full of scripts attached to everything you've ever encountered in the game - you can see how that adds up quickly with time.   Fucking around with it also doesn't help.  It's possible you could save the level 11 save with an orphaned scripts cleaner. It's also possible that the level 5 save would be fine.   My guess is that one or more of your mods has scripts that the community would consider ""unstable"" - i.e. attaching to many objects/npcs etc. but not being removed, perhaps poorly coded/taking up too much time, or other issues.   If you haven't already, you may wanna check out this list and discussion and see if any of the mods you use are on the list. If you post your modlist, others may also share their experiences with mods on your list.   The one thing hardware can do is mask the problem/allow you to run a heavier (but still stable) order. A load order that'd give me 300 ms script lag on my laptop (2.4 Gz per core) without any particular instability gives me 60 ms script lag on my desktop (4.0 Gz per core). But your issue is far beyond that."
skyrimmods,3dttrm,Thallassa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:05:28 2015 UTC,"Great answer mate, thanks.    How do yall post your load orders with the spoiler button I see from time to time ? I'm not sure what the format is in this sub.  I'm using LOOT through MO, changing it up - for example, putting Frostfall further down - if needs be.   I've gone on ... ah ... the level 5 save was a different character, whereas I had an earlier save of the 11 character. While having a CTD when alt-tabbing ( which didn't happen before ) the game is still running swiftly, hovering around 70 mlseconds. The level 5 character ... was just smooth as a babies bottom, leading me to believe it has more to do with my tinkering.  I have none of those dodgy mods. I've been relatively careful this time, believe it or not, because I didn't want this to happen. ; p  Gone for lighter stuff if I can ( and wish I'd tried out Immersive Horses ) and keeping an eye on community consensus etc. But clearly not careful enough. But there are some script-heavy ones in there. If both saves do not deteriorate - which, I would guess, is impossible to predict with certainty - then I think they'll be fine."
skyrimmods,3dttrm,Thallassa,2,Sun Jul 19 13:41:18 2015 UTC,You would want to use http://modwat.ch/ to post your load order. It's the simplest way.
skyrimmods,3dttrm,Thallassa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:43:46 2015 UTC,OK. Hope this worked. ; p   http://modwat.ch/Tieshaho3#/plugins
skyrimmods,3dttrm,Thallassa,2,Sun Jul 19 13:59:36 2015 UTC,"Okay!   I don't see anything that should be causing problems like you described. Like you said, you've avoided most of the dodgy mods.   The mods you have that might contribute to script lag are Combat Evolved (this is the most likely culprit in terms of causing your issue, although very few other people have reported issues with it). I think someone posted the other day that it might not remove scripts properly after leaving combat, but I don't know for sure.   You also have some script-heavy mods like Frostfall and Wet and Cold. Those mods run a lot of scripts which is probably exacerbating your problem, but all of their scripts behave properly so it's not causing the big difference between your two saves. However I've had serious issues mucking about removing/adding those mods mid-play, so if you've done that with any of your script heavy mods, that's probably the difference. If you have a clean save and you don't do that, it should behave fine."
skyrimmods,3dttrm,Grimy_Bunyip,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:54:14 2015 UTC,"Well, my shit went sour around - ie maybe a little before - the time I installed CE. I was trying Deadly Combat, Revenge of the Enemies et al on different saves. Dammit, I thought CE was script-free.   I didn't remove either FF or W&C. In the whole process I've minimalized the functions W/C is using, dropping npc breaths etc. Going back to an earlier save definitely seems the go. I wish there was some tool than could definitively diagnose a problem in a simple, user-friendly way.  As I said, the level 5 save didn't immediately bend under the workload. Of course, anything I say about scripts and the way they work, beyond a basic understanding, is my imagination. ; p By which I mean it can be a bit like going on WebMD and diagnosing yourself when you're not a trained doctor.  Anyway, thank you very much for your help. ; )"
skyrimmods,3dttrm,Grimy_Bunyip,2,Sun Jul 19 15:16:18 2015 UTC,"Hrm, sorry, I think I got CE mixed up with one of the bazillion other mods - you're right, CE is script free. I wonder which one I was thinking of....   Well, I'm clearly not a trained doctor either. Blind leading the blind over here.   You could try running the script save cleaner. I've never done it but it might very well fix your issue/show you what's up."
skyrimmods,3dttrm,Plockton,2,Sun Jul 19 15:20:54 2015 UTC,"I've done that. It stopped crashing in my level 9 save, the earlier form of the one that went shit. I'ma fuck about with load order, though, cos I see LOOT has arranged Combat Enhanced in a way that's not what's on the box.   I was having a lot of fun with what was a rather unusual character build for me that totally refreshed my zeal, so I really didn't wanna give up on the save ... but it wouldn't hurt for me to try the older one and see how that goes, as long as it remains stable."
skyrimmods,3dttrm,OpticalChicken,2,Sun Jul 19 15:22:33 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, the only mods that apply as you encounter things are ones that apply spells on NPCs.  Like for example, if a mod wants NPC's to stagger, it might apply a script on that NPC to cause it to stagger when hit."
skyrimmods,3dttrm,_Hedonism_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"Right, so you mean ... it's not like exponential script growth or anything. My problems were bad management, it seems : new games don't struggle at all with the same load."
skyrimmods,3dttrm,_Hedonism_,2,Sun Jul 19 21:50:16 2015 UTC,"Well script growth can be a problem. But there could be other problems as well.  For example, how many dungeons have you cleared in the last week (game time)?  It takes a while for dungeons to reset, and until they do, the information about those dungeons is stored on your save, which might affect performance."

skyrimmods,3dv90l,Master_Touch,2,Sun Jul 19 20:22:38 2015 UTC,I ran into a similar issue a while back and it took me forever to find the solution.

skyrimmods,3dv90l,Chezetoats,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:03 2015 UTC,That's weird because I actually moved it to the drive my OS is on last night before this problem started.

skyrimmods,3dulyo,myztikrice,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:22:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really want to endorse the mod, but the author taking such a hardline on removing the NPC is silly.  I mean come on man, you made an awesome mod, why let some juvenile joke ruin its reputation?"

skyrimmods,3dukb5,fate7,2,Sun Jul 19 17:53:30 2015 UTC,"Okay, well anything marked Requiem is probably safe unless you have a mod that adds onto Requiem and used the same naming convention. And most of the other effects are from Wet and Cold, which is also fine.  So the one I'm curious about at this point is the Ragdoll Monitor.  It's the only one I don't see being immediately explained away by Requiem or Wet and Cold, though it might be.   I'll do the work of looking through the mods I think are suspect, because I've had this exact problem before and I know how annoying it is to solve.    In the meantime, you should uninstall Dance of Death and replace it with Violens.  It'll save you a lot of headaches in other areas.  EDIT: Okay I've confirmed it was the one I thought was suspicious.  It's your ""Essentials Ragdoll on Knockdown"" mod causing the problem.  It is indeed tied to the monitor I pointed out.  I went and opened it in TES5EDIT and confirmed that the flag was not set.  Here's a screenshot proving it: http://imgur.com/gETbBDq  Try uninstalling that mod to see if it's the only problem.  If it is, and you're brave, you can go in and set that flag yourself.  Note you'll probably have to re-run the Reqtificator after doing this."

skyrimmods,3duz9a,benpenn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:45:04 2015 UTC,"That blue swirly thing is the effect shader for the Spell Absorption magic effect. In Vanilla, fairly few NPCs have the ability to absorb spells, but some mods make it much more common(notable examples include Requiem and Disparity).  Cloak spells, like ""Flame Cloak"" have a constant Area-of-Effect. Lots of mods these days use special invisible Cloak spells to distribute scripted effects onto nearby NPCs. Because they're invisible, you're not supposed to notice them. However, if an NPC ""absorbs"" this cloak, you'll see the swirl. Modders can avoid this by making sure the cloak spell is marked to ""Ignore Resist/Absorb"". Sometimes, this marker is omitted, and you'll end up seeing blue swirls everywhere.  As Benpenn says, Campfire is one such mod that uses cloak spells, and it has been determined that the ""Ignore Resist/Absorb"" marker was omitted, probably by accident. The mod author has logged the issue and will hopefully fix it for the next release.  If you're impatient, you can use TES5Edit to fix the problem yourself.

skyrimmods,3dsec1,fadingsignal,14,Sun Jul 19 00:22:33 2015 UTC,I would really like to see Varla and Welkynd stones that are actually usable added to Skyrim. I've never come across a mod that does that. Only a resource.  It would be nice too if they were made a little more useful than they were in Oblivion. Maybe the welkynd stones could have enough charge to fill multiple items and a Varla stone could recharge infinite items? Or for a more balanced approach maybe the Varla stone could function like Azura's star? I always hated how in Oblivion they were so damn pretty to look at but so damn useless otherwise.  (Any progress on Dogs into Huskies and your Realistic Husky Sounds? :P)
skyrimmods,3dsec1,El_Monstero29,5,Sun Jul 19 00:53:34 2015 UTC,"I love this idea, this is exactly what I'm looking for.

The cool thing about doing artifacts is that, much like Bethesda, you can reimagine them instead of just trying to make a 1:1 copy from previous games. Really, I'm down for anything. It would be cool to see your interpretation of some ES artifacts."

skyrimmods,3dsec1,Stairmasternem,3,Sun Jul 19 00:48:32 2015 UTC,"One thing I would love to see is more decorations/ trinkets/ amulets made from carved bone - mammoth or whale. Also lacking in Skyrim are altars to Hircine - there are the totems if you do the Companions, but what if you aren't a werewolf and just a hunter? Maybe you would carve an animal skull, or perhaps an antler and turn it into a statue.  Which makes me think of another thing lacking: altars to all the Daedric Princes. Small altars like those found in the temples instead of large statues.  Last thought - gems imbued with various shouts. Sort of like the Nordic equivalent of welkynd and varla stones. Instead of magic recovery and buffs, they could have one use dragon shouts for those rping as non-Dragonborn. Or they could be used for crafting into rings/amulets/etc."

XD  As far as artifacts go, I'd actually go a different route and say maybe fill in the gaps for artifacts that already exist as far as complete armor sets, compatibility, or themes/equipment that there aren't currently many artifacts in. Although of course this would very much depend on how this train of thought fits in with the particular quest you are making so I would understand if this isn't necessarily the best concept for you.  For example:   Feet, head and arm pieces to match the saviors hide better Old dwemer weapons and artifacts that aren't necessarily just modern equipment with a dwemer theme More artifacts that are amulets etc as that's a rare thing in Skyrim compared to previous games"

Then you should take a look at this video segment and this post which describe how to manage your Mod List priority order, the left hand side of Mod Organizer, in an organized fashion.  Please read the entire thread that I linked.  It's important that the Master files and Unofficial patches have nothing above them in the Mod List priority order, left pane, and are in the same order as they are in the Load order, right pane.  MO will give you a warning concerning a possible priority order problem when these are not managed.  Managing your Mod List Priority Order is as important as having LooT manage your load order.  It is a virtual installation order that you can manipulate in order to force the correct overwriting files you want to show up in the data tab, right side, which is the end result of your Mod List priority order. This freedom is just one of the bigger reasons why we use MO.  You can use my mod list as a reference for the folders being discussed in the thread I linked.

Suicidal baby is right - your install order has problems which could be causing this - but I bet your load order has problems too. LOOT doesn't catch everything. This is why we use modwat.ch. It gives us everything all in one go.   Some more points - when you download mods you need to go to the FILES tab and pick out all the options. DO NOT EVER USE THE BUTTON AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE. Always go to the files tab to download.   You wanna know how I know you did that? You have aMidianborn book of silence - Creatures, and none of the other files from that, same thing with Skyrim HD 2k. Go download the rest of them!   However, you'll want to check your other mods to make sure you got the version you expected, and compatibility patches you need.   (And surely had you actually launched the game you would have come to us ""my texture mods don't work!"" This is also why we test as we go).

For example, when you install a mod in MO and it doesn't match the standard /Data file structure it makes a popup asking if you really want to install the mod with improper structure, but lets you ignore it if you want. Something like this where you click an override button and it asks if you really want to and maybe advises it's for advanced users might be a good option.  This way there's the benefit for users who do like the automatic option and the option to choose what you want."

I know there's only a handful of mods changing their installs like this so occasionally having to manually add patches isn't bad. I'm thinking more of when the majority of installers act like this, installing hundreds of mods with manual patches will take a long time. It's a very good design idea and I expect to see more installers use it in the future which is why I want to talk about possible options to make it better for everyone."

This lets you change the order in which you installed mods because everything is virtual.  So if you have this big overhaul you want to install, but it will cover up a smaller mod that you like, all you need to do is drag the smaller mod to a higher priority and it will show up in game.  This basically means, you can install mods in any order.  With NMM if that same case came up, you would have to reinstall that smaller mod after you installed the bigger mod.

If 7ZIP can open it and display the contents, then the file is likely fine... if not, then the download is bad.  Larger files can sometimes get corrupted in the download... that's just the nature of things.

I personally don't go nuts with the high-res textures and the like... but you'll have to find your own balance.    Make sure to configure your Skyrim game properly using all the latest/greatest memory enhancements and all that...  Moderate your expectations and be sure to keep the game optimized.  You'll also get a bit of a boost from installing the game on the SSD as opposed to the HDD if you want (but modded Skyrim folders can get BIG so watch your space).  If you bump down to 720P, you'll get butter smooth 60FPS in most areas with plenty of headroom for adding mods/ENBs.  On a 15.6 screen you may not even be troubled by the lower resolution...  Just remember that no matter what, it's a mobile GPU (and I think the benchmark desktop equivalent of the 970M is about a 580 or 760.   http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html  But unless you spring for the 980M (which I don't think you had the budget for) you're pretty much getting the top-mobileGPU-dog until next season.

As with any new software it's going to take some learning but there's so much documentation out there and most of MO is pretty intuitive.   On top of that the spirit of modding is one of experimentation and being willing to try stuff just to see what it does.  TLDR: I agree
skyrimmods,3drz3k,Terrorfox1234,3,Sun Jul 19 02:00:42 2015 UTC,"The gray lightning symbol means that all of that mod's files are being overwritten by something else, causing it to be obsolete.

skyrimmods,3dt7fa,EnaiSiaion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:51:14 2015 UTC,"The other problem is that the creation of a definitive mod pack essentially marks the end of further mod development in those domains.  You can't compete against a mod everyone gets by default.  Let's say the pack includes Apocalypse. There would be no point in developing any other spell packs because 95% of the users now have Apocalypse without even giving it a second thought. No Lost Grimoire, no Midas Magic (perhaps not a bad thing if you like your game ad free), nothing.  Instead of a mod pack, we need curated mod lists. STEP only features enhancement mods and zero new content, and GEMS relies heavily on the opinion of a small number of people who may or may not be prejudiced. If we had five more such lists, the problem would be solved.  Not that it matters at this point. With FO4 in four months, the Skyrim mod scene is on a death clock. Perhaps we could do a mod pack AFTER FO4 comes out and Skyrim mod development comes to a halt."
skyrimmods,3dt7fa,Nazenn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:15:25 2015 UTC,"While I don't necessarily agree with your opinion that it would halt development of other mods in that category, examples being that Apocalypse for example is pretty much already the go to magic mod for new players and yet Lost Magic and Lost Grimoire have recently been made regardless, it would limit the knowledge of new mods which can be essential for such mods to grow and develop properly with less people going looking for them etc.  Modwat.ch could certainly be a really good option for curated mod lists. Mine is a horrible example because its effectively just a mess of what I have collected, but people could easily set up lists under other modwatch names to show people, so for example my main is Nazenn, and then there could be Nazenn-New-Lands etc. I really think that modwatch as a tool hasn't been fully developed use wise in the modding community yet :)  Nor do I believe that FO4 will kill Skyrim modding, as its two very different styles of games, and not everyone who likes Skyrim likes fallout etc, but it might have a dint for sure."

I don't know how many mod listings you've looked at, but I see them all the time: ""Do not clean"" when there's nothing that needs to be cleaned. Much like the topic of ""put this mod last"" comes up in LOOT discussions when there's no need for 99% of the mods that ask for that to actually need it.  So I'm not sure where you're trying to go with this post."

skyrimmods,3dq89i,sveinjustice,8,Sat Jul 18 19:18:31 2015 UTC,"More pointless than anything. If another mod needs a patch, ITM'ing things won't solve that. In fact it's more likely to make even more patches necessary since it's unlikely the other mod wants vanilla values to be used.  In the specific case of Thunderchild, the author says they need the ITMs to prevent changes to the shouts from being undone. Yet, TES5Edit says all of the ITMs are for other things that have nothing to do with the shouts. They're typical ITMs in cell records and other unrelated material that won't impact the mod one bit if they're removed. Which they should be, because they will make other mods need patches to regain any changes they're intentionally making to the affected cells."

The author talks about it in terms of losing potential dialogue, but nothing in the list of ITMs that xEdit spits out has anything to do with dialogue. It's all random junk the CK likes to screw with for no good reason. It may not cause actual harm to leave it, but it DOES contribute to unnecessary compatibility issues.  The two deleted navmeshes are inexcusable though. They will be a source of potential CTDs. They would be extremely easy to fix as well."

If the mod author was trying to edit the navmesh to make it fit their additions, all removing the deletions will do is restore the vanilla layout. Which is likely going to be wrong. So they'd need to go back and try, more carefully, to fix it again afterward."

The windmill isn't missing, the mesh texture is looking for a missing overwritten mesh.  You need to organize your Mod List priority order so that the correct overwriting files end up in the data tab, which is what ends up in the game.  You should take a look at this video segment and this post which describe how to manage your Mod List priority order, the left hand side of Mod Organizer, in an organized fashion.  Please read the entire thread that I linked.  It's important that the Master files and Unofficial patches have nothing above them in the Mod List priority order, left pane, and are in the same order as they are in the Load order, right pane.  MO will give you a warning concerning a possible priority order problem when these are not managed.  Managing your Priority order is as important as having LooT manage your load order.  It is a virtual installation order that you can manipulate in order to force the correct overwriting files you want to show up in the data tab, right side, which is the end result of your Mod List priority order. This freedom is just one of the bigger reasons why we use MO.  You can use my mod list as a reference for the folders being discussed in the thread I linked.

Approximately 60% of those people do not have DCO installed. So every time someone comes to be and says ""DCO broke the dragons in my Miraak fight"" the only thing I can say is use the troubleshooting on the UESP, and there is a good 50% chance that you would have needed to use anyway because that fight is flat broken in the vanilla game in the first place. DCO potentially MIGHT make the bugs happen worse, this tends to happen when you modify something that is buggy in ANY game it tends to result in the flaws being more obvious, but I've never seen actual evidence through the people who have asked for help with the fight that there is a brand new bug or a bug that only appears with DCO installed to that fight.  If someone else has proof please feel free to correct me, but this is one of those 'misconceptions' that is driving me up the wall as well.  Asides from that, thank you for typing this up Apollodown, I know this is the sort of stuff that frustrates you but I appreciate the effort and I'm sure I will be directing a lot of people here."

skyrimmods,3dpiz0,Elianora,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:38:46 2015 UTC,"Removing DCO likely fixed the bug because it would have reset the dragons ai, effectively like a restart, if not doing a restart in one of the most risky ways possible. You can receive a similar result by disabling and enabling the dragons with the console or teleporting them to you which is how I get people usually to fix the bug regardless of any dragon mods they have installed. I have had that method flat out not work, but once again, the people who have tested it for me have had it not work with both DCO and the vanilla dlc dragons"
skyrimmods,3dpiz0,Nazenn,7,Sat Jul 18 20:35:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so one of my earlier playthroughs with DCO I got jumped by 3 mid-level dragons outside Rorikstead.  I was playing a stealth archer, and thanks to the mod Skyrim Unbound I was not the Dovahkiin, and because I don't like follower combat AI, I didn't have any followers.  I also had reinforcements and limit breaking set to their default values.  I got utterly fucked.  I actually heard the limit break shout as I was hiding behind a rock denying the dragon line-of-sight, and seconds later a terrible force collapsed on me and I instantly died, my corpse ragdolling all over the road.  IIRC, it almost looked like Fus Roh Dah combined with a black hole centered on me.  It was infuriating that I died, but epic that it happened at all.  Instead of bitching about how Apollo is a terrible designer, I got over my pride of being a solo adventurer, used Amazing Follower Tweaks to control every aspect of my new followers, embraced my role as Dragonborn, used the MCM in DCO to turn dragon powers like limit breaking and calling reinforcements down, and now my new character is able to fight multiple dragons much more effectively with two or three other followers helping to take down the truly epic monsters dragons are supposed to be.  I've even dramatically increased reinforcement calling recently, and I might start stepping up limit breaking too.  I still get knocked around a lot because dragons like to land on top of me, but one time I was able to avoid the knockback by jumping as the dragon landed.  That was awesome.  But I still get thrown around a lot, and it's fucking terrifying when you have Enhanced Camera or some other first person camera mod.  It's awesome.  If you don't like DCO, don't be a whiny bitch.  Just uninstall it.  If you think you can do better, learn some programming and write what you think is a better dragon combat mod.  DCO is Apollo's opinion on how dragons should fight.  Use it or don't.  Don't bitch about it.  Also, to /u/apollodown: Thanks for making your mods.  I may not agree with every design decision you made in making the mods, but there is no denying the scope and quality of your work, and I really appreciate the effort you put into them.

While the fact that the general guards aggression doesn't start after the battle of Whiterun is understandable (since PC acts as an emissary), it shouldn't affect random groups of soldiers wandering in the world. I've been running in full imperial armor for God knows how long before the battle, and Stormcloaks didn't mind me at all (and I was an Imperial, to top that).   As for the general feel, I've already written a few posts here where I think that the ""overhaul"" is quite limited, and doesn't live to its hype.

I had all other guard affecting mods disabled at that time so I have no idea.  Other than that, 11/10 would recommend. Just not for me anymore, when the end result is still ""5 whole NPCs refer to the war as actually being over"" giving myself more stress during the war didn't seem beneficial anymore.  [Edit]: I should add this was before I was using SkyUI (I never realized there was a UI free version that just had the MCM framework and unpopular-opinion-puffin I goddamn hate the UI changes) so I didn't have access to the debug menus or very well probably could've fixed everything on the fly like CHIM was oozing out of my fingertips.

skyrimmods,3dqmap,rightfuture,2,Sun Jul 19 01:22:29 2015 UTC,someone should make a list of all of these city mods (and improvements). and add to it!   Should be one of our reddit weekly discussions in my lowly opinion.  :)
skyrimmods,3dqmap,rightfuture,2,Sun Jul 19 02:11:41 2015 UTC,Legendary Cities - Skyrim Frontier Fortress - Adds several well done cities/fortresses mentioned in previous games.  ClefJ's mods - He has several towns and homes. New Amberguard is his newest town.  Helsmyrr Village - A really nice town in the Rift.  Seapoint Settlement - A town in the Northwest corner of Skyrim.  Snowbound Acres - A dunmer village near Falkreath.

skyrimmods,3dqmap,rightfuture,3,Sun Jul 19 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of mods that add more civilization to Skyrim, myself.   Here are the things I've tried and recommend: Sorry about the lack of links. I don't have a lot of time to post right now.  Expanded Towns and Cities - While it doesn't technically add any new settlements, it does a lot to enhance the ones that already exist by adding more buildings, npcs, and even some quests.   Legendary Cities - TES Arena - Adds 11 new towns across Skyrim that are very well designed and fit in well with the architectural style and lore for their respective areas. It's one of my favorite mods and I can't imagine playing without it.  Hroldan Nightgate and Sawmill Villages - Adds a total of 8 new villages to the game in locations where you'd expect to find small towns - on the main roads near the vanilla sawmills, on the north coast, and surrounding Old Hroldan. Not all of these villages are compatible with the towns from Legendary Cities, so I run the full version of that mod and the modular of this one.  Aurora Village - Adds a pleasant little village and player home on the north shore of Lake Illinalta near the crossroads that head south to Falkreath.  Helsmyrr Village - A large and prosperous village in the northern part of the Rift. It's a bit isolated, but it's such a pretty place that I enjoy visiting it.  SeaPoint Settlement - A lovely little village, lighthouse, and player home far up in the northwest corner of Haafingar not far from the docks leading to Castle Volkihar.   Snowbound Acres - This is an isolated Dunmer village up in the southern mountains by Falkreath, between Angi's Camp and the Bloodlet Throne. It's kind of an odd place to find a village of Dunmer, and the player home is awfully silly (its a large barrel), but I encountered no bugs or issues with it.  Fleetford - Is a small village and player home located on the main road between Whiterun and Windhelm. It's a bit heavy on performance, but otherwise works as intended. Having another blacksmith trainer in the game is really handy.  Pinewood Village - Adds a fun little Bosmer treehouse village and player home between Morthal and Dragon Bridge. Another one that's kind of hard on the performance, but I really do like it.  Tharash Dal - Orc Stronghold and Player Home - Adds a fully furnished stronghold player home with NPCs (mostly orcs) near Talking Stone Camp. You don't need to be blood kin to visit or move into the stronghold.  Here's what I run for  city overhauls, some of which add a whole lot of content around the exterior of the cities, as well:    Smaller hold capitols and villages:  Expanded Towns and Cities  Windhelm:  Snow City - The Great Expansion of Windhelm  Riften:  JK's Riften, Skyrim Riften Eastern Road  Markarth:  Sky City - Markarth Rising, JK's Markarth, Understone Keep Fountains and Rubble  Solitude:  Solitude Reborn, JK's Solitude, My Own Solitude Outskirts Improvement, Solitude Docks District  Whiterun:  Ultimate Whiterun, A New Whiterun, Perfect Whiterun (outskirts plug-in only), Whiterun Outskirts Market  Here are some things that a lot of people like that I haven't tried out yet:  Moon and Star - This is a quest mod that adds a Dunmer village on the south shore of Lake Ilinalta very near to Aurora Village (there is a compatibility patch).  Tel Nalta II - Is a grow your own Telvanni tower home that is essentially a village, as there are multiple mushroom buildings and NPCs you can recruit to live there. It's in the same general area as Aurora Village, and Moon and Star, so you'll want to investigate compatibility.  ThirteenOranges village mods over on Steam Workshop - He's got a handful of mods that come highly recommended, but they haven't been updated in awhile and they do require cleaning before installing.  Here are things that people sometimes recommend that I advise against:  Forgotten Settlements - Is not lore friendly, has a ton of navmesh issues, clipping, terrain irregularities, and is just poorly designed in general. Some of the added content is pretty good, but so much of it isn't that I advise staying away from it.  Woodhalt - It looks beautiful, but most of the NPCs don't have any kind of patching routine, so it feels like a ghost town. I've also heard that it has some game-breaking issues."
skyrimmods,3dqmap,TeaMistress,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:17:14 2015 UTC,"Your choices are always awesome. I continue to be inspired!  I am torn whether I want to find .esp space to add the Riften Eastern Road. I may have to see if I can merge it.   There are several great windhelm combos out there right now. Skyrim Radioactive - Windhelm docks, Better Cities Windhelm, I personally still like the Dawn of Windhelm, Jk's Windhelm, Skyrim Radioactive docks (old partial version) combo with Fine goods of morrowind and the Gray Quarter.  Love to get the new Radioactive windhelm docks exterior working with it (but that's a longer project right now)  Not sure I'd want Woodhalt or Tel Nalta II for this playthrough. I have to be selective at this point.  We really should make a post on which cities will merge(and how to do it) to free up .esps. I have gotten some of the individual cities (non-Etac) merged (and working) thanks to Missjennabee merge forum on her ETaC page.  Forgotten Settlements is a really underrated set of mods, I don't play it's oakwood because it's clippy and a little buggy, but everything else is mostly awesome.  Legendary Cities, Forgotten Settlements, and Hroldan Nightgate is a awesome combo btw. Add ETAC and/or Dawn of Skyrim and you've got a ton of new cities. Just don't install the modular cities that conflict that you prefer - there's not a lot of them that do.  ETAC is a must have (also)in my opinion."
skyrimmods,3dqmap,rightfuture,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:33:38 2015 UTC,"Falskaar is pretty massive and adds many fully voiced NPCs and a large new area to the world. Although there is a main Falskaar quest and there are still necromancers, bandits, and other annoying things. So maybe not exactly up your alley, but I enjoy the locations and friendly NPCs in it.  SeaPoint Settlement is pretty nice. It adds a seaside village in the north of Haafingar, close to the dock where you travel to Castle Volkihar.  Solitude Docks District is also a pretty ok mod. It adds some buildings next to the docks, close to the underneath of the arch. I've found some navmesh issues in the past, but they're pretty minor and have most likely been updated since then.  Other than that, try browsing through both the Cities, towns, villages and hamlets, as well as the Locations - New tags on the Nexus to see if there's anything else you'd be interested in."
skyrimmods,3dqmap,thenerdyglassesgirl,2,Sat Jul 18 16:57:38 2015 UTC,Are all of them compatible with each other? Because I just might decide to get them all.
skyrimmods,3dqmap,TheFallen837,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"All three locations are compatible with each other. The major issue with compatibility in new location mods is making sure another mod doesn't occupy the same cell space, so they don't overlap.   Falskaar is an entirely new region, so it doesn't occupy any Skyrim world space. Mod compatability with Falskaar is making sure world modifying mods also work with it. A lot of major mods provide Falskaar support (Frostfall, RND and WATER come to mind) so make sure you install compatibility patches if they offer them if you plan on using Falskaar."

skyrimmods,3ds5pn,GeekSquadUZ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:09:57 2015 UTC,You need to use bodyslide and make a custom body with race menu morphs enabled.
skyrimmods,3ds5pn,Zthordorus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:29:48 2015 UTC,"Which will generate files in the overwrite folder, which I put in a folder of their own. Not sure if that's bifta but works so far."

skyrimmods,3ds5pn,Jack_Hat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:50:06 2015 UTC,"I'll try to make this clear as possible. After you have everything installed correctly, open Bodyslide. Select an HDT body and then you can either make your own body preset or choose one.  Then click the check box under Build Body. Now click Build Body. Your naked body will work with the in game CBBE Sliders.  You need to go through each and every armor and clothing and do the same thing (make sure the check box is checked and click Create body). You have to Click Create Body for each and ever armor/clothing you have in your game that you want the CBBE Slider to work with. They also have to be compatible with HDT/TBBP. The Mak ChronoTrigger77 armor replacer works. It makes the armors a lot different. making them range from kind of skimpy to really skimpy if you use the zap check boxes. You might need to find and download vanilla armor HDT Bodyslide files if they aren't in the game already. Bodyslide doesn't give everything HDT support on it's own.  Do the same thing for any custom armor/clothes mods you have that have bodySlide support and that you've installed into bodyslide.  Now you can use the in game CBBE slider and it'll work on your body with anythign you wear. If you have EFF, you can recruit any NPC in your game. Then talk to them them and bring up a Tattoo Command which lets you give them any tattoos you have installed, AND let you use the CBBE slider on them. Allowing you to give any female NPC her own custom body. Be warned though, that recruiting a character will make their relationhip max out with you. So everytime you see they'll say how great it is to see you. Not a big deal, unless you find that immersion breaking.  There's also bug with CBBE sliders. With some armor, i'd say about 20-30% of them, when you load a save, your clothes' textures will be buggy. You can fix this by taking them off and putting them on again or by going into showracemenu and leaving.  This glitch also applies to NPCs if you load a game with them in the same cell as you (it only happens to NPCs that you've used the CBBE sliders on via EFF. if you dont use EFF to edit NPCs in-game, don't worry about. if you do, in order to fix it you have to edit them and exit or take their stuff of and put it back on."

skyrimmods,3ds4wv,Thallassa,2,Sun Jul 19 02:30:18 2015 UTC,"My ENB reserved memory is 256MB. Last night I tested with 512 and 1024 with no change. Memory blocks log did not go over 384MB. Today I reverted ENB reserved memory back to 256 and loaded Skyrim without Dawn: buttery smooth. For kicks, I re-added Dawn and it worked much, much better than last night. Totally confused by that... I'll do more testing today to see if it was fluke or if it just decided to work correctly now.   Resolution textures are primarily 2K, with a small amount of 1K textures and an even smaller amount of 4K textures. I'd say nothing added by Dawn (town clutter, stalls, etc...) is over 2K. I've added my Modwatch to the original post, if you want to peruse it."

""It's sort of like having the world's largest ball of yarn and deciding you're going to unravel it,"" he said. ""Everything is so tied together that in some ways it's almost impossible to do.  ""I honestly, genuinely, don't know what it means for the future. It was an idea we worked on with those guys for Skyrim; it didn't pan out. It came back down.""  Wrapping up our interview, Hines said you shouldn't expect to see Skyrim's paid mod system return anytime soon. That's in part because Bethesda has a little project you may have heard of called Fallout 4 keeping the developer busy ahead of its November release date.

In the tiny window the paid mod debacle took place we had:   Lots of infighting, people acting like a violent mob (against other mod authors I mean; I fully supported the community voice toward Bethesda / Steam to get what we truly wanted) SkyUI folks out of retirement to give us the amazing 5.0 Frostfall 3.0 fast tracked, Campfire, Art of the Catch, Last Seed fasttracked Wet and Cold 2.0 and Wonders of Weather Thousands of awful / useless mods uploaded to the Nexus as usual   Money WILL change things.  It could make the bad worse, but could also make the good even better.  That's the polarization this kind of thing brings, and it's subjective whether that's wholly destructive to the modding ecosystem.  I still have tons of mixed feelings.  As for curation, I personally don't want Bethesda to hand-pick mods, because that won't be fair.  Only already popular / well-known authors will have Beth/Steam's attention.  I want high-rated stuff to end up at the top, just like the Nexus.  Crappy cash grabs won't be seen unless you browse new stuff.  Basically 100% exactly the way it is now.  You're going to have pretty waifu girls next to amazing functionality, because people want that, will vote with their wallets/rating system, and anything useless or cash-grabby is going to be rated poorly into oblivion (har har.)  The vast majority of mod authors are of the Forever Free camp, and the ones who went down the path of paid mods almost immediately adopted a delayed free release model, so I think there is potential for everything to be OK, as long as people don't start witch hunting people, and respect their decisions.

The concept of paid mods isn't why it was bad for skyrim, let someone pay 2 bucks for a sword if they want. What was bad was introducing it into an already-existing ecosystem built upon interdependencies, as well as a lack of policing.   What I do see happening is mod makers getting approached by Beth asking if they want to make a buck, and if so, getting their already existing mod featured on a paid mod page, or a tie-in with other upcoming games.

I'm pretty sure that's what the industry does (as well as most other industries).  As for teams, the best way is probably too come up with an agreement, and make contracts.

There are plenty of engines out there that are far more attractive, to say nothing of the fact that I get to keep far more of the revenue.  A potential built in audience isn't going to offset the 25% share.  It probably won't be attractive for any other other modders who are interested in doing large scale projects.  The way that paid modding was implemented made absolutely no economic sense, even to someone who was moderately receptive to the idea.  I'm exactly their target audience, and was completely turned off to the idea by how poorly they handled the situation.  Bethesda doesn't understand how to interact or communicate with their modding community.  But more importantly than that by offering such a low amount for compensation it's only going to encourage individual modders to flood the market with low quality easily craftable content.  You won't see many large scale DLC style mods for sale, perhaps ever.  50 cent gauntlets are probably going to be widespread and commonplace."

However, there's value to using the popularity of an existing game over trying to market a new game. But if you think you can make a whole game, do it!   A potential built in audience isn't going to offset the 25% share.   ... Why?"
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,LondonRook,0,Sat Jul 18 16:40:12 2015 UTC,"Reposting from last month.   Okay, you've brought up the 25% split a few times, so I just want to address this one point. Changing minds rarely happens over the internet, but here's something you might not have considered. Modding is different than most professions because of the nature of the work.  A author has to just create a book or a screenplay. This requires expertise in one field, creative writing. Editors are then hired to rework the material, send technical feedback, and generally keep the authors in line. Authors also require agents to help market the material and represent them to potential publishers. This is a very narrow specialization.  It's exactly the same for songwriters, who only have to be a musical entertainer. This requires a single skill, to know how to either sing or play an instrument (sometimes neither). Again an agent is recommended, as well as a producer who do most of the heavy lifting of promotion and distribution. They don't have to be an expert in makeup, fashion, or social media. A musician in the traditional sense is a product. People buy into brands like Beyonce or Lady Gaga.  An artist when painting for a client only has to know one thing. How to draw and create art. Indeed many of these pieces are abstract and nonrepresentational. And even here the market rate for selling in a gallery is generally 50% iirc. As for individual commissions the artist gets to keep all of that. And as it's set right now, modders can't make commissions for individuals.  And as a mod author, lots of these mods require a cross disciplinary expertise that can include all of these, or even none of these. Designing a quest mod is much more akin to being a director than an author, and requires a generalized knowledge across multiple fields. And the high barrier of entry for an individual to create longform digital content should be commensurate with a higher percentage of the revenue.  Animation requires a good working knowledge of anatomy. Lighting and world creation requires a good knowledge of interior design and how to properly dress a set. Scripting requires a working understanding of programming, and so on. To say nothing of the expense of hiring voice actors or other professionals which would come directly out of your cut.  There's no reason to accept or expect an industry standard in a nascent industry. And to think that forcing people to settle into a bad deal is a good practice neglects the truth that if they try to squeeze too tightly it only discourages mod makers from not participating at all in their for profit model.  My point was that small revenue share generally leads to roles which are overspecialized. The general rule for any industry is the more labor you can take on yourself, the greater the percentage of the gross you'll receive. Make the number too low such as this case and you actively disincentive developers from making large scale projects. A 25% share will only lead to more smaller mods, and less DLC style content that you'd actually want to buy."
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,SPOOFE,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:36:55 2015 UTC,"It's a great post, but I don't really see how it answers my question."
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,shezrie7,0,Sat Jul 18 22:00:57 2015 UTC,25% is a huge fucking share.
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,kontankarite,0,Sun Jul 19 23:26:16 2015 UTC,"... Why?   Because it's a hard sell to consumers.  I doubt most people are going to be willing to pay for high quality and expensive user created content on top of spending $60 or $90 for the standard or collectors edition, respectively.  The barrier to entry is too high if you're charging for a reasonable return on your time.  And once the base game does reach steam sale lows people have moved on to other titles.  The reason why this hasn't happened with Elder Scrolls and Fallout games is because the modding community has been around for a decade at this point without much competition.  If Bethesda shows that it can make a profit off of whatever new model they choose it's going to encourage other developers to make their games modder friendly, and that'll distribute both the community and the consumers across multiple games.  The model that's been shown to make bank are games with micro-transactions, and they generally work for three reasons.  The best examples of thriving marketplaces that exchange actual cash are the ones with a low or no cost to entry.  While it's true the majority of users who play f2p MMOs do so without ever purchasing anything, that's offset by the small percentage of powerusers who actively buy everything in the market.  Secondly what they sell is tied to the mechanics of the game itself.  This is especially true in mobile development with the ability to reset cooldowns.    Third, the costs for the virtual goods are so low as to be seen as a good value for the player.  This is done through very small amounts, and with that you have very small items for sale.  Powerups or extra lives.  Bonus ammo or weapons, that sort of thing.  So basically, even if I sold it for an incredibly cheap cost, there's a significant amount of users out there who won't buy it out of principle.  And another set who can't buy it even if they wanted to.  If you can't make it up on volume you have to increase the cost of the mod.  So you're catering to a small minority of people who both have enough disposable income to risk $20 on a mod, and won't worry if the mod isn't perfect.  By developing larger mods you run an exponentially greater risk of creating more incompatibilities with other mods, and that also will effect sales.  It's much safer and makes far more financial sense to make simple mods that won't present those kinds of complications.  I could spend the next 9 months making a Moonpath to Elsweyr on the hope that it'll become a smash hit.  Or I could diversify and create 30 player homes and a dozen new sets of armors and have a large library people could choose from.  It's the same amount of work, and the latter options presents a far safer stream of revenue.  Now you might say that a refund system could be potentially implemented, but that presents its own issues, as we saw in the last steam marketplace.  Piracy notwithstanding, even if it were perfect I suspect that most consumers simply won't buy items that are priced at a relatively expensive point because there's a psychological difference between spending 25 cents on an item and $20 on new content."
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,shezrie7,0,Sat Jul 18 22:29:10 2015 UTC,"Because it's a hard sell to consumers.   Inequalities in profit division has never been a significant deterrent to consumer habits.  While you've certainly ejected a large number of eloquent words, I'm just not seeing how you've actually responded to my post. Specifically: You state a 25% margin can't possibly be enough, even with the built-in potential audience. I'm just wondering how you can justify that statement."
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,xtkbilly,2,Sun Jul 19 06:35:50 2015 UTC,"You would have to put up a lot of money upfront before even seeing any profit a year or more down the road when the mod is finally complete, to get voice actors. They cost a fortune. Voice actors will not work on a system of being paid only if/when the project is a success. Bethesda can do it because they make millions from each game so they can afford voice actors upfront."
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,SdSquid,2,Sat Jul 18 12:27:18 2015 UTC,There's a gulf of different between someone who VAs with a 100 dollar mic at their house for a mod and an actual professional voice actor.  No one is asking H. Jon Benjamin to voice act Dickz-in-Reedz the skooma chugging wizard Argonian.
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,SdSquid,2,Sat Jul 18 17:09:55 2015 UTC,Except that in a pay for mod people WILL expect and demand professional voice acting. Having used plenty of volunteer voice actors in my own mods I am fully aware of the complaints and derisive comments on free mods about voice acting. Every voice acted mod gets it. People literally expect professional level even on free mods. In a pay mod the level of volunteer voice actors would not be tolerated. Nothing other then professional would.
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,SdSquid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:14:14 2015 UTC,"Ooph, that can be pricey. But I guess it's up to the modders and VAs how they want to make money. If the VAs are okay with taking a split instead of getting paid upfront, that's up to them. For the modders, if have to say it's kind of a ""have to spend money to make money"" situation if they are wanting to venture into a paid mod system."
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,SdSquid,2,Sat Jul 18 16:20:22 2015 UTC,But I would say they are some of the only ones worth monetizing in any way.

skyrimmods,3dp9wb,DZCreeper,3,Sat Jul 18 21:21:59 2015 UTC,"I hope/wish that before they implement anything like this, they discuss it with us first. The community at large, I mean.

skyrimmods,3dp9wb,Twistedtomsky,2,Sat Jul 18 08:17:09 2015 UTC,"I hope they don't.  If Bethesda had asked the ""community"" if they should make Dawnguard as DLC or Dragonborn as DLC, the ""community"" would have said, ""No, that content should have been in the game at release, so you should release that content for free.""  The only way to make paid mods actually happen is to just do it and keep doing it, and then help other companies follow suit with paid mods for their games, until paid mods is an industry standard that consumers just expect—just like DLC. Sometimes you have to drag people into the future kicking and screaming."
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,The_Profit_,2,Sun Jul 19 23:39:06 2015 UTC,"No, I mean they - if they must do it - they do it paid, no matter what, but they at least ask us for thoughts on things like... layout, cuts, etc.   I still hope they don't go paid, but even so.

It would be a fatal mistake on their part if they refused discussion and a referendum from the modding community."
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,kontankarite,6,Sat Jul 18 12:37:10 2015 UTC,Paid mods is just a bad idea for a game like Skyrim. It always will be.
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,doombunny0,2,Sat Jul 18 08:30:56 2015 UTC,This doesn't bother me as much. Having paid modding avalable at the start of a game's life cycle is more acceptable then at the middle of it.
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,TheAlp,-1,Sat Jul 18 11:36:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think that matters.  If FO4 has paid modding, you're going to get a shit storm all the same.  Let's not pretend that just because Bethesda releases a new game, that it's all new unaccustomed consumers.  Bethesda doesn't have just the Skyrim community to contend with when it comes to paid modding, they have an actual modding community around Betheesda themselves.  It doesn't matter if it's FO4 or ES10.  There's generations and over a decade of a modding culture that's been formed around free mod tools and free modding.  That doesn't change just because a new title comes out.  It can be argued that Bethesda would find it's worth alienating their long time customers for a new stream of revenue.  There will be no smooth transition from a culture of free modding around Bethesda titles and one that makes mods paid for."
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,doombunny0,3,Sat Jul 18 17:20:11 2015 UTC,"If this happens again, I'm staying out of it. My mods will never be paid but that doesn't mean I want to get into this again. It... it fucked a lot up between people, so if this does happen again - sure, protest it, but let's try not let what happened last time happen again (see: modding relations in the community getting messed up).  Whatever happens though, this will not be happening near FO4 release. That would be very bad PR, less people would buy, etc. Plenty would still buy, but less would and it would NOT be good so close to a significant release."
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,doombunny0,2,Sat Jul 18 06:10:22 2015 UTC,"I think a patron style system is really the only way to make this work. The people who think it's worth it will use it and it's relatively easy to ignore it you just want the mod.  I think the issue will be forever divided and both sides have valid points. Deep down though, a lot of modders change their mods pretty frequently and sometimes a new mod just isn't for them or gamebreaking in some way. When you have to pay, just to test drive, it breaks the system and flexibility. People without expendable income will most likely wait for master lists of bulletproof mod lists that all work together and have no issues just so they can pay the absolute minimum and not break the bank. For obvious reasons that will break the freedom of the modding community's enjoyment of playing entirely different games especially if they don't have the money to buy new games anyway.  That being said, I absolutely think their should be some form of monetization for the people who makes these incredible works of art. I thibk a patron system will work, or similar to youtube, something like pageview and ad rev generated on their page might be nice.  But Bethesda wants their cut and that will be the death of any painless pay what you want system."
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,fireundubh,2,Sat Jul 18 14:23:15 2015 UTC,I'm actually so so on paid modding? But if it's there I actually want Beth to treat it like DLC. Have some QA and offer refunds with a decent time frame.   But other than that if someone wants to charge for their mods I'm fine with that that's their prerogative.
skyrimmods,3dp9wb,AndrewJamesDrake,2,Sat Jul 18 06:23:27 2015 UTC,I will pay for mods when the money goes to people who it costs to make mods.  Its takes time from modders to make mods. They deserve most of the money.  Its takes bandwidth from distributors to make mods public. They deserve some of the money.  That is the end of the story as far as I am concerned.

Keepsakes by Matthias showed me that it was possible to get form ID's from an inventory menu. And then CDcooley/Schlangster showed me how to get formID's from crafting menus too, although I haven't put that latter bit to use yet.  TLDR: You can salvage weapons/armor/etc from a single hotkey directly from your inventory menu now. Which, I believe gives GUISE the most convenient smithing->salvage mechanic on nexus right now. Booyah.  Okay, this is where the other contestants jump on the bandwagon too right?"

Maybe. I dunno."

skyrimmods,3dp127,svenbros,2,Sat Jul 18 04:56:36 2015 UTC,"That's why I ended up posting about the update, because I know that if it were me, I might be like you and forget to check for updates if I didn't download it the first time and didn't have MO to remind me. And just stressing over whether or not to post about the update - I didn't want to over advertise like Grimy mentioned, especially since I don't really feel like my mod is a real mod since it's such a teeny tiny change compared to the mods shared by everyone else here and it doesn't actually take any talent or skills to make. And I promise that's not fishing for complements or anything like that, I'm totally okay with saying that about my mod because it's 100% true. The moderators for /r/skyrimmods even mentioned that that's kinda why they picked this theme since really anyone can make recipe changes in CK and it would allow more beginners (aka me) to join in on all the fun!

The Greybeard robes exist in the game, but they won't show in your inventory as the data is not complete. Wyrmstooth has it as well, with at least one character from the group that you're with when you first go after the dragon (it's as far as I've gone).

The forts are there (they were build by the nords or the empire) and some have been abandoned. So it makes sense they would be occupied by bandits, vamps and necros. Bandits actually ocuppy a number of diferent strutures like caves, improvised wooden forts, and large stone forts. Bandits just take what they can get.  Barroque mansions would be out of place in skyrim. There are maybe some barroquish elements in Solitude, but that's it. I understand that the forts lack some flare for a certain idea of what vampires are. But maybe some change in decor would do the trick. They took the fort some time ago and eventually redecorated it in a more barroquish fashion.  Edit: reading it again it sounds a bit authoritive (not intentional).

skyrimmods,3dosjk,EnaiSiaion,4,Sat Jul 18 00:49:11 2015 UTC,"Why not use the tree to promote a unique playstyle? Right now a thief can fight as a warrior in light armor with light weapons, or as an assassin sneaking and killing silently with a dagger and poisons, but there's no ""scoundrel"" playstyle utilizing a thief's dexterity and creativity to best opponents.    A pickpocket would eschew armor of any kind for clothing, both to blend into crowds and to ensure they are unencumbered if it comes time to fight or escape.    While a mage would have a spell in their off hand, and a warrior a shield or another weapon, a pickpocket needs to keep one hand free at all times to pinch goods or deliver distractions.    Another thing a pickpocket would have is a bounty. Nobody gets good at picking pockets without getting caught along the way, so perhaps devise some system of rewarding a bounty as notoriety and street cred? Both as incentive to avoid save scumming and as an additional way to distinguish a thief character from mages and warriors.    So, the prerequisites are: no armor, criminal history, and only one one-handed weapon at a time. Without perks that's an extremely vulnerable playstyle, so the perks need to fill in the gaps in both defense and offense.    Defensive examples: * Ability to dodge attacks based on a percentage of pickpocket skill. * Chance of a temporary speed boost when hit. * Classic smoke bomb vanish. * Throw gold on the ground to distract attackers. * A chance to catch arrows.    Offensive Examples: * Ability to temporarily blind or disorient an attacker (throwing sand or clutter objects?) * Ability to bypass shields. * Ability to hamstring a target to slow them. * Ability to regenerate stamina (second wind). * Ability to confuse or distract a target (reduce their damage). * Damage bonus proportional to bounty (confidence/enemy's fear of your reputation).  The desired result is not only the ability to steal items from unsuspecting players, but also having a number of options to deal with the situation should you get caught - fighting, distracting, and escaping - rather than just reloading the game. While a real thief would avoid combat at all costs, the majority of skyrim's content requires it, so we need to empower a thief character to deal with their enemies directly but with an underhanded flair. By using the pickpocket tree you also discourage unarmored mages or single weapon warriors from borrowing the thief's abilities without demonstrating a dedication to criminality by picking pockets to develop those skills."

This isn't Pirates of the Caribbean. This is up there with Vatican Magic, but I see no gameplay reason for this as you can reverse pickpocket poisons.

Also, some users (I am culprit of doing that before) might just click the download button on the main page to automatically download into NMM and won't even look at the files section (that buttom should probably be removed :X )   The second file might be confusing for noob users (should I download this as well? why are they apart? are these worse than the others or smthg? fuck it... 150 new spells is enough for me). I know I had this mindset at some point.  SKSE might be responsible in part but I doubt it explains the whole difference between the 2."
skyrimmods,3dosjk,TuxedoMarty,3,Mon Jul 20 03:16:47 2015 UTC,"I had a couple thoughts about pickpocketing last week, although I'm not sure how well either of them could be implemented.  First would be simpler. The game already has the ability in game to just bump into npcs. What if an early perk in the tree gave you a percent chance to steal gold from npcs you bump into? It would give an easier way to level pickpocketing and is a little reward. Since it could happen accidently it probably shouldn't be flagged as a crime.   Other idea goes beyond perks and would need scripting. Dishonored's pickpocketing consisted of belted money pouches and keys hanging off the backs of character's belts. Would it be possible to accomplish something similar in Skyrim, similar to how iNeed has visual waterskins? Then override the inventory steal if you are facing the npcs from behind and are undetected.   Probably go beyond perks, but these are the only things I could come up with to tweak the pickpocket a bit."
skyrimmods,3dosjk,mecarr,2,Sat Jul 18 11:01:40 2015 UTC,"I actually really like SkyRe's solution: Combine Pickpocket and Lockpicking and create an entirely new tree. (Even though I'm not the biggest fan of Wayfarer as it is currently implemented) As Vanilla Pickpocket and Lockpicking are by far the worst trees to invest points in.  Combined with Mods that make Lockpicking a lot harder and a few other small changes this makes Fingersmith actually a pretty useful tree for thieves.   I agree that save scumming is still a problem, however if you feel that way, you can just stop quickloading everytime something goes awry rather than download a mod that forces you to stop doing it. As someone who alreay plays Skyrim in self-enforced hardcore mode all the time I wouldn't mind the feature, but I'd keep it optional for sure.   I think what Fingersmith really needs is new Game Mechanics to go along with new Perks. F.E. Breaking a Lockpick could create a sound that could alert or even wake nearby enemies and npcs. This sound could then be reduced via a Perk in the Fingersmith tree. Another idea would be to expand on the Poisoned Perk in the Vanilla Pickpocket tree, which is in my opinion the most interesting mechanic within the tree. Maybe make several follow up perks that increase poison damage if applied that way. Or make reverse pickpocketing more interesting in other ways (your cursed pirate coin for example, though I would prefer a more lorefriendly item specification)"

The problem is that the game still has a pickpocket mechanic and I need to deal with that in the pickpocket tree.  So I'm angling to see how much people actually care about pickpocketing."

Makes it more versatile to use for non-thieves and adds some interesting mechanics to pickpocketing. My most favorite perks:   Light Fingers (Novice) - Your Pickpocket skill increases unarmed damage and your chances of successfully picking someone's pockets. Keymaster (Expert) - Pickpocketing keys almost always works. Toxic Touch - Silently harm enemies by placing poisons in their pockets. Dodge - When not wearing any armor, you have a chance to take no damage from incoming attacks. This chance increases with your pickpocket skill (max 25%). Brigand's Brew - Consuming alcohol increases your melee damage by 30% for 15 seconds. Acid Splash - As long as one hand is free, melee attacks deal 50% more critical damage and have a 20% chance to deal extra poison damage over 3 seconds.

Just seems lazy.  Anyways I have looked at these 3 mods under the hood, and I'll share what I've found.  First of all, Ultimate combat doesn't release its source PSC files publicly, so I can't comment on its implementation.  Deadly combat applies 11 scripts to all nearby enemies. These scripts each have up to ~5 condition functions that the game needs to process each time the scripts are refreshed. The scripts are refreshed, I think every 0.6 seconds? which can be a lot. And some of the effects are kind of implemented in a really silly way. Like it makes NPCs block by sending a block animation event every 0.05 seconds. I kind of doubt sending 20 animation events per enemy per second is really a great idea. So I'm not really a fan of this implementation.  I got banned off the bethsoft forums the last time I expressed my full opinion on DUEL, but long story short, the last time I checked DUEL's code, it applied scripts to all NPC's within a large radius once every second. But these scripts were constant effect. Deadly combat's scripts terminate themselves after 600 seconds, but DUEL's lasted forever. Meaning the longer you played the game, the more you would bloat your game and save file with scripts that would never go away. That was 2 years ago though, I don't know if the modder fixed them. I doubt it though. When I informed him of the issue, instead of fixing it he threw a tantrum and removed his mod from nexus, which in turn got me banned from Skyrim forums for being responsible for a mod being ""removed""."
skyrimmods,3dnq9t,Grimy_Bunyip,3,Fri Jul 17 21:55:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation.   Do you know an alternative you think is well implemented?
skyrimmods,3dnq9t,lojunqueira,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:46:30 2015 UTC,"Ultimate and deadly combat are the only two mods that come to mind that apply ""AI"" scripts to enemies unfortunately.  I've been busy modding so if a new one came out in the last 2 years, I probably overlooked it. But if you find one I'd be happy to take a look at the scripts for you."
skyrimmods,3dnq9t,Grimy_Bunyip,3,Fri Jul 17 23:52:00 2015 UTC,"If you've got the time, could you take a look at action combat? Anyone banned by bethcuck mods for calling out stuff that needs to be called out is a good person in my book."
skyrimmods,3dnq9t,orderingrabbits,8,Sat Jul 18 00:41:55 2015 UTC,"Alright, here's what I got:  It uses a cloak as most combat mods do, to apply scripts. The scripts applied are constant effect. Same issue as DUEL. It only removes these scripts when an actor dies. But I didn't find any checks for whether the script applies only to enemies or not. So if you enter whiterun, it'll apply to all the NPCs in whiterun who isn't inside an interior. And it won't go away unless you kill everyone in whiterun or build a complicated script cleaner patch for action combat. Fortunately this isn't THAT bad because the scripts applied are triggered on events. But it's still not great.  The stagger script doesn't have any looping. It reduces a character's ""poise"" on hit, then refreshes it after 10 seconds. The other scripts that also handle the effects seem to all be handled strictly through events, so the actual scripts applied aren't that heavy.  It uses condition functions to decide whether or not to apply normal or hardcore scripts. Which is bad because these condition functions are checked every second on the cloak effect. If he cached it, he would only need to check once.  He used 6 different stagger magic effects for different durations of stagger. Which wouldn't affect performance much at all, but is completely unnecessary.  It could definitely be implemented much more efficiently than it is right now. That's for sure. The scripts it applies to NPC's aren't that heavy. It's just the process by which it applies scripts to actors really needs a bit of work.  Changes I would like to see:   Cache the various settings, don't run a condition function each time you apply scripts to NPCs. Only apply the scripts using a combatstart event, instead of once every second via a script. Terminate the scripts after a period of time. He could use self.getMagnitude() to merge the various stagger magic effect records into a single record."
skyrimmods,3dnq9t,Grimy_Bunyip,3,Sat Jul 18 01:07:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks a lot. I wasn't expecting such an in depth analysis. Really interesting stuff man."
skyrimmods,3dnq9t,orderingrabbits,2,Sat Jul 18 01:36:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed analysis.  You make it sound better than the others. maybe I'll give it a try. the parry and poise systems are interesting.  Have you thought of making a combat mod or is it something that doesn't interest you?  Edit: Forgot the extensive combat options in Skytweek... including the stagger script
skyrimmods,3dnq9t,lojunqueira,2,Sat Jul 18 02:40:42 2015 UTC,"The SkyTweak scripts are a few years old. All the scripts will terminate properly, but I could probably optimize them more. They just haven't been high on my to do list.  Well it's still going to end up with the same script leak issue as DUEL, so I still wouldn't recommend it.  What you should do IMO, if you really want a combat mod badly, is fix the script leak. IE open the ESP file in the creation kit, and replace all the CE cloak effects with duration based ones (like 5 min duration or something). It's a fairly quick and easy change to make. It won't fix all the performance issues, because at the end of the day, a cloak that updates periodically isn't ever going to be terribly efficient, but at least it won't permanently affect your saves."
skyrimmods,3dnq9t,Grimy_Bunyip,3,Sat Jul 18 03:54:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks again. I'll have to try it.  Combat Evolved and Revenge already make improvements to AI.   Skytweak can be used to change things like block (dmg blocked and stm cost), weapon dmg, stm regen and stager.  There are also some simpler combat mods that only deal with stamina management, like Vigor and Fighting Fatigue.   Between all those things, I think it is not that dificult to get proper combat mechanics without any the big 3 combat mods."

skyrimmods,3dnq9t,lojunqueira,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:20:34 2015 UTC,"So, this is yet another constant effect cloak that applies scripts, but it seems there's a separate spell that, when cast, terminates all scripts inside the script radius, but when I backtrack this cloak spell, I only see it being added within an MCM menu?  So like, I could be wrong but it seems like it has the same script application issue as a number of other mods I mentioned before. But when you disable the cloak spell that applies the AI scripts, it applies a new cloak spell that terminates all scripts within a (10 yard?) radius. Which, seems like too little too late if you already played for 100 hours and applied a script to NPC's all over skyrim."
skyrimmods,3dnq9t,Grimy_Bunyip,2,Sat Jul 18 02:01:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks again.  As far as I understand the MCM toggle is there to deal with the Brawl Bug...

You seem to be fairly knowledgeable on the topic, do you have any suggestions for combat mods that are well made? If there aren't any I think I would rather go without than take a performance hit."
skyrimmods,3dnq9t,DZCreeper,3,Sat Jul 18 02:32:39 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, the last time I reviewed DUEL was 2 years ago. I haven't looked at the code since then, it could have been fixed by then.  No I don't really have suggestions for combat mods, I don't really use them in my playthroughs. There just aren't too many great ways to improve combat.  Like, some of the mods make it so NPCs have a chance to dodge your attack. But I don't consider that necessarily more fun. It just makes combat take longer. If it's just an RNG chance, it's not like you can play in a way to interact around it.  Then DUEL tries to change gameplay by doing stuff like, altering the reach of your weapons and tweaking stamina costs and so forth. These are all very subjective changes.  I made a combat style mod, basically SkyTweak for Combat Styles. But I found that changes to those weren't too impactful either. Like you make enemies block a lot and keep their distance, then combat gets tedious because everyone's so hard to kill. If you make everyone too aggressive, you get dogpiled in certain scenarios and that isn't fun either.  So like, I really think combat is subjective. If you let me know what kind of combat you're looking for, I could point you in the right direction.  Try not to think of it in terms of ""I want better AI"". I think that's a trap a lot of players looking for combat mods fall into. It's very easy for a modder to make enemies more defensive, or more balls out aggressive. And then just subjectively claim that it's ""better AI"". But if you make enemies too defensive, combat becomes slow and tedious. Too aggressive? and you get dogpiled, and you end up in situations where you don't really have much breathing room or defensive options.  But yeah, if you let me know exactly what you're aiming for, I could at least point you in the right direction."
skyrimmods,3dnq9t,Grimy_Bunyip,2,Sat Jul 18 04:00:17 2015 UTC,I tested several combat mods on a low to medium-spec rig and found that most add script latency in combat to some recognizable extent. Hence I backed out of them all and left Combat Evolved (only the AI) in there. Then I just use SkyTweak to adjust combat a bit.

Anyway, thanks for the analysis! I was gonna ask about Action Combat, too, but reading your answer ... I think I'm gonna stick with Combat Evolved. It makes enemies aggressive and fights harder, and the bells and whistles and promises of the scripted mods were making me think I was missing out on something ... but that is enough."

skyrimmods,3dnq9t,mrjentipede,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:51:11 2015 UTC,That's not a question I have enough scripting knowledge to answer.  I had gone to most of the major towns and numerous dungeons (using the Populated Dungeons Prisons from ERSO) and have not experienced issues.  The reason I do this is because I used Deadly Combat prior and did have significant script lag and would have to clean the saves often and have a very high active script count (and the reason I looked for something else).  I can't comment on the efficiency of the coding but I can say that I experienced a significant difference between the two.

skyrimmods,3dnq9t,Grimy_Bunyip,2,Fri Jul 17 21:30:32 2015 UTC,"As far as I could tell yes, but it has a papyrus log spam issue which landed it on the list anyway. It may still be there but it wasn't anything massively noticeable as far as my testing showed"
skyrimmods,3dnq9t,Nazenn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:05:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, papyrus log spam isn't necessarily horrible.  Let me give you an example.  Hotkey Spellcasting is a feature in Grimy Utilities. It gives experience, proportional to the spell cost. BUT if for some reason, you cast a spell with a negative cost, it throws a warning.  So, obviously you COULD suppress this, but adding a check for negative magicka costs. But is a check really worth it for such a niche scenario? Not really IMO. It's providing a warning, but it's not causing unintended behavior.  Either way my stance is that it's always best to reverse engineer mods if you want to know how well they do. I don't think going by papyrus log is useful at all. I guess Jaxonz diagnostic is so-so as a rule of thumb? But script performance is obviously going to fluctuate over the course of the game, so I'm not convinced that's a great way either.  Like I said, it's simply an issue where DUEL doesn't clean up its scripts after it applies them. Just check whether or not it does in the code."
skyrimmods,3dnq9t,Khekinash,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:10:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, the papyrus log stuff isnt horrible, but I actually used it as a warning against people having the log on while playing for extra stability, the same as I have a general warning in there against mods that have deleted navmesh's because of the problems that can create. The author was really nice about letting me use his mod as an example though which I'm thankful for.  Jaxonz Diagnostics as a script latency tester can actually be really good for judging average script performance as you can use it on several settings and over various lengths of time and it out puts a max, a min and an average along with a modded average to compare it against which is nice. Its still not the best, but its definitely a good start for the average player and also just for testing mods under certain circumstances, like a dragon fight etc"

Secondly you need to carefully read the entire description page, and any included readme files of every single mod you install.  I know it sounds like a pain, and it is, but it is the only way to ensure you have a stable game with such a large load out.  You have several mods in you load order that are made obsolete and conflict with others.  Namely, you are using differentlyebony.esp and the amidianborn content addon.

Gopher's Mod Organizer Instructional Series will teach you how to use Mod Organizer correctly and set up the 3rd party programs listed in the Beginner's Guide.  Then, you should take a look at this video segment and this post which describe how to manage your Mod List priority order, the left hand side of Mod Organizer, in an organized fashion.  Please read the entire thread that I linked.  It's important that the Master files and Unofficial patches have nothing above them in the Mod List priority order, left pane, and are in the same order as they are in the Load order, right pane.  MO will give you a warning concerning a possible priority order problem when these are not managed.  Managing your Priority order is as important as having LooT manage your load order.  It is a virtual installation order that you can manipulate in order to force the correct overwriting files you want to show up in the data tab, right side, which is the end result of your Mod List priority order. This freedom is just one of the bigger reasons why we use MO.  You can use my mod list as a reference for the folders being discussed in the thread I linked.

You can use Campfire for any length of time and when FF3.0 or LS are ready, you can just layer them on top of Campfire and you're good to go.  If you currently use Frostfall 2.6 you will need to perform a clean save before installing Campfire and FF 3.0 / LS, but even after doing that there may be issues that require a new game, since you are not really upgrading Frostfall in that instance, you are uninstalling FF 2.6 and installing 3.0 which are so architectually dissimilar as to be different mods. And uninstalling mods has never officially been supported by Bethesda.  A word about requirements, since I have more concrete information:  Campfire:   Requires the base game Is better with SkyUI 4.1+ Is better with SKSE   Last Seed:   Requires the base game Requires Campfire Requires Hearthfire Requires SKSE Is better with SkyUI 4.1+   Frostfall 3.0:   Requires the base game Requires Campfire This is still being actively developed so I'm not sure if SkyUI or SKSE will end up becoming required.

The description is:   Black Marsh was once known to be inhabited with what the Argonians called the Wamasus. Northern men considered them to be intelligent dragons with lightning for blood. One such mighty beast, Haynekhtnamet, was slain by the Northern men, though it took 7 days and nights, and a score of men. One of the surviving men took a fang home as a trophy. The fang was carved down into a blade and fashioned into a small dagger. The Dagger mysteriously houses some of the beast's magical properties and grants the user the ability to do shock damage on an opponent.

Make sure you actually hit Sort Plugins and hit Apply  Papyrus Logs are not crash logs, they are event logs and they record everything not just stuff that is strictly problematic  Make sure you have the Shalikans patch for JSwords, the original plugin is corrupt and should not be used.  Ive had a few reports directed my way about Dynamic Merchants being problematic but I havent yet verified them, so try removing that. If you just want the dynamic gold amount feature then use Trade and Barters MCM to set up a similar system  You appear to have two versions of Dogs of Skyrim with different esp names  Dance of Death has been superseded by Violens A Killmove Mod so concider swapping to that  But thats all I have noticed so far.

I'd heard that Papyrus can be used to find script based crashes.   I appear to have the patch already.   I'll look into dynamic merchants and disable it... given the crashes are unrelated to merchants being in the area, it's not a likely candidate  I believe one of those is an optional file for the original  I'll look into it as well. I'm not going to mess with that one yet because I've had issues with similar mods related to animations and skeletons and I'd prefer not to kick that hornets nest until I have this one sorted out  As for the test after doing what was listed... it does seem marginally more stable, but it still CTDd after a couple minutes. It's hard to tell better performance from simply being within the margin for error. There is also a weird issue where some of the vanilla armours and weapons suddenly appear purple (Usually indicating a missing texture pack.) That might be unrelated... I've had Vanilla armours leaving bodies invisible when removed in the past. The list I've triple checked in sorting and I disabled Dynamic merchants. Mod watch has been updated."

XD  Now its LOOT sorted definitely, but your previous list was not. The first check that we always run to see if LOOT has been run is the order of your DLCs and Patches which should be as yours are currently. Previously you had Dragonborn above Hearthfires which LOOT actually has metadata set to not allow. Either way, now its run so it should be fine.  Papyrus is the name of the scripting engine as whole, not the name of the logging system. The Papyrus log can be used to find script based/caused errors, but errors do not always mean crashes, and a lot of the time errors/warnings don't actually mean a problem will appear in game. Often the time with the odd occurrence where a script causes a crash it won't even appear in the log because the game crashes before it can actually output the information.  As far as Dynamic Merchants go, its worth giving a shot. Depending on the implementation, some mods have much further reaching consequences then you would expect. A famously buggy mod called Locational Damage for example I just advised someone who was having problems with animations not executing to take it out of their load order, despite the fact that it only uses scripts to divide people up into impact zones, and suddenly he found his problems were fixed.  Thats... odd about dogs and skyrim. Normally esp patches have vastly different names to make clear what they are. Oh well, learn something new all the time when it comes to naming schemes XD  Violens doesn't touch the skeleton as far as I know, and doesn't touch animations as a whole, only the specific scripted kill cam ones which can all be modified via the MCM. If Dance of Death, which is more buggy, works for you, then Violens should as well, but its not a major thing, just a recommendation  If the meshes that turn out purple are always the same meshes, for example always the iron armor, then its a missing texture of some sort. If the meshes that render purple are different, so one game its the iron armor and then next its steel, then its almost always a VRAM problem and usually followed by a VRAM crash due to running out of graphics memory. I would suggest making sure that your graphics card is properly definied in your... I cant remember if its Skyrim.ini or Skyrimprefs.ini off the top of my head. I would also suggest making use of the Skyrim Performance Monitor to check your actual memory usage for RAM and VRAM and seeing if its peaking out. Id check your skyrimprefs.ini for you but modwatch appears to be buggy and is only showing me the skyrim.ini when i click on it  Also despite what someone said in your previous thread, CoT is not script heavy. It doesn't come with any additional scripts and it doesn't use any scripted events, only the vanilla weather system script which is only a little more intensive due to the amount more weathers it has to pick from.  Other things you can try:  Remove DeadlyMonsters. It doesn't have any major issues but it doesn't play nice with other mods, so its worth a shot to remove  You said your crashes were mostly on the plains of whiterun, so try removing SkyRealism Grass or lowering grass density via your ini files. under the grass section of skyrim.ini put iMinGrassSize=40. I believe 20 is the default, and if you are using a mod with the Grass on Steroids patch like Verdant (not sure if skyrealism uses it) then you want it to be 70 at max for decent visuals and performance, I personally have mine at 100  Immersive Beds can be problematic with scripts getting stuck and also with compatibility issues. I recommend replacing it with Go To Bed  If youre worried about too many scripts in your game then iNeed is lighter then realistic needs and diseases, and it should also have eating and drinking animations already so you can remove the additional mod you have for that as well if you want  I recommend getting a bashed patch. It won't fix your stability issues but it will help your mod list be a lot more compatible. More info on how to do a bashed patch in Wrye Bash via the beginners guide in the side bar"
skyrimmods,3doqbz,Nazenn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:32:34 2015 UTC,"That's all very helpful, thank you.   I'm almost certain it's a mod issue for these things, not VRAM or graphics related... I don't think even HD texture packs are likely to dent my specs. I've tried Skyrim performance monitor... cannot for the life of me get it to actually work. For some reason it shows my GPU at either 0%, 5% or 100%... often with no practical change (And makes even less sense because I'm never even using more than half my VRAM). I'm inclined to doubt its hardware related though... my hardware maxes settings on GTA V and usually hardware issues cause stuttering first and slow the game... my game runs smoothly, then stops dead, not even a flicker of stuttering. I'll look at the mod selection though... I'm not all that attached to the ones you mention anyways.   What I am unclear on is exactly what is meant by making sure my graphics card is defined... I've allowed Skyrim to detect my graphics settings through steam if that is what is meant... but nothing in either file seems to relate to my graphics card specifically."
skyrimmods,3doqbz,Nazenn,2,Sat Jul 18 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"Under display in my skyrimprefs.ini I have this line : sD3DDevice =""AMD Radeon HD 6900 Series"" which I'm not sure is vitally importaint but I have heard of others having problems if the wrong card is defined there.  And I know your hardware should be able to handle it, but from what youre saying it for some reason doesn't appear to be working properly with the game which honestly has me stumped, I am definitely a software person, not a hardware person XD  The problem is I just dont see any other issues in your mod list that I can pick out, and even my last lot of suggestions was me being more nitpicky then anything else (with the excption of immersive beds which I should have picked up on sooner)"
skyrimmods,3doqbz,Suicidal_Baby,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:48:02 2015 UTC,"My lingering suspicion is that it might not be a mod as such... a lot of them have installers for choosing options and that includes compatibility patches... except if I selected a patch for a mod I don't have or missed one for one I do, that might be the cause. It's not unlikely... somehow I selected an animation for sheathing swords on the back that I don't remember selecting. I might have to resort to the process of elimination method and hope that picks out the problem. Time consuming and annoying, but might work. Thanks again for the help though."
skyrimmods,3doqbz,Suicidal_Baby,2,Sat Jul 18 04:52:38 2015 UTC,If you hit a patch for a mod you dont have the game would crash at the Bethesda logo. If you missed a patch for a mod you have then you simply wouldn't get that compatibility or you would get clipping depending on what type of patch it is. Its rare that patches would cause CTDs.  Elimination is honestly your best bet though. I have pointed out absolutely everything I can see and that I can think of so right now its really just up to you to do some more digging

skyrimmods,3dmfwd,Ferethis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:37:11 2015 UTC,"Eh, you can make some pretty serious mods with tes5edit.

skyrimmods,3dmfwd,Pevey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:08:20 2015 UTC,"True, but just about anything that's considered a large mod is going to involve scripting and/or cell/worldspace editing, which is possible with TES5Edit but way more realistically done using a visual representation of the area.

There are plenty of very good writers who write for mods here, that do it for free - not because it seems like doing it for free is some amazing thing, just because well... mods are free, and it's very rare mod authors pay for work for their mods - ESPECIALLY not writing, since that is probably the easiest sort of thing to find for mods. Yes, writers can be flaky, but they are around APLENTY - it's people who can actually make mods that are the most sought after. I think it's great you're looking to get into this as a hobby, but if so - here's a big part of this community (the general mindset of it).

If you're using an ENB use the option there, this one takes priority."

If you have suggestions for this, please post them.   https://github.com/chesko256/Campfire/issues/89 https://github.com/chesko256/Campfire/issues/90      I'm looking for pretty concrete use cases that make sense, usually with one action and one output.  Examples: ""I want a follower to go get wood, and put it back in the pile."" ""I want a follower to take wood from the pile, and put it on the campfire.""      And so on.      Having a solid list of these actions, and why they would make for interesting gameplay, would help me justify the development of the feature. Try to dig deeper than ""because it would be cool/immersive/etc"" and describe what potential problem it solves. The ""keeping the campfire tended"" features are pretty self-explanatory in terms of what it gives the player (hands-off campfire management, frees the player up to do other things, etc) but I need a wider spectrum than that to make it something that I'd want to invest time into."

Which, if it's cool enough, is sometimes fine, but I was struggling to come up with some solid reasons to develop a framework around it.  The idea would be that you would have Followers and Nodes, and you could tell them to ""do stuff"" with a Node in a generic way. A Node might be a woodcutter's block, tent, woodpile, campfire, trap, so on. In some cases you could replace Node with Radius, i.e., ""hunt for animals in this area"". You'd still want an endpoint Node to deliver the Output of the process to however."

skyrimmods,3djoz0,randomusername_815,2,Thu Jul 16 22:13:12 2015 UTC,It's not a bad idea.  It might be better to approach a particular mod-maker who's made something similar to what you have in mind since they've already demonstrated a particular skillset and the ability to deliver a quality mod.  Then its a straight-up client/artist deal with no race-to-the-bottom bidding-war from every cash-grab sloppy modder trying make a quick buck and delivering a buggy mod.  You could do it privately and it avoids the problems people had with the paid mods fiasco:  All the money goes direct to the author.  You get a polished bug free mod the author can support.  All the community perceives is an author put out a cool mod so the community benefits (and may even donates a little more)

As someone that still has a 290x (which performs slightly worse than a 390) in one of my rigs and used to own a 970 (it's a 980Ti, now in my main rig =P).

For NPCs is I think 0.7. I had a problem with my followers that this value would randomly drop to 0.0, which makes them stop regenerating health. Some NPC have it set that way, at least from my observations (like the guy you have to escort to the Eldergleam Sanctuary). But it's the randomness that kills me. I hired Jenassa at some point in my travels, and knowing this issue I checked her HealRate - perfectly normal. A few days later, I suddenly see she stopped regenerating health. I thought it might be UFO, but it's not; I thought it was Perkus Maximus, it is not; I first thought it only affects vanilla followers, but low an behold 3dnpcs got it as well. I'm lost. It is pretty interesting, since your load order differs from mine with the said mods, so it might help pinpointing the problem source. The more I think about it might be something from vanilla or maybe patches?  So, in order to bring back the healrate you;d have to type  setav HealRate 0.7   (after selecting the NPC).

You will never get that to change and nor should it as Valve does quite a lot in the background for systems like this, even though their customer service is crap. It's Bethesda I took issue to given that they don't support their game or tools, or the workshop anymore and when they removed the paid mods they left the workshop utterly broken and unable to function for even free mods, and someone with an attitude like that is not worthy of the major cut of a plugin made by someone else and entirely supported by the community."

In short, arrogant creators   That is a very arrogant and rude presumption to make regarding the modders involved. The first wave of mods was priced higher because the 25% made it necessary in order to actually receive any kind of profit. I wanted to price mine at 50cents, but at 25% it would have mean't no profit, a mere few cents per buyer. I ended up at 1.99, making 50 cents per sale. Next, mods had never been for sale before and no one really knows what they are worth, so we were feeling out the market. You can always come down but you cannot go up so it made sense to start higher and let the market dictate where things fall into place."
skyrimmods,3dmp2k,saris01,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"Before I go further I must say I hold no grudges for people wanting to make money from their hard work.  My opinion comes from observing the general consumer software industry over the past 20 years.  I still believe paid mods will hinder a thriving community.  Much of the modding community's success hinged off the fact that mods were freely available.  This also added value to the game because people still buy and play Skyrim long after other games have faded away.  I am not opposed to paying for a few extremely good mods that have full support behind them.  I think this would work better if Bethesda allowed commissions, and would maybe commission a few of the best modders around to work on some DLC.  This way the modders get some money and the end users get official support.  I do like it better knowing that the mod authors are doing this because they like to, and I am not being nickel and dimed to death.   Donations and commissions are the way to go.  Also, I am sure a good bit of the mod authors, not all of course, do not really understand the extra work and headaches that comes along with selling software.  The way it is now, you are under no obligation to provide support or deal with the end users.  Once you put a price tag on it though, it is a whole different ball game."

Nobody gets 25% outside user-generated content for games.  Everyone who stomped their feet over that share simply didn't understand the simple fact that everyone has to make money. The licensor, the distributor, and the creator all have to make money. And make money they do with other Workshop games. Tons of it.

skyrimmods,3dmp2k,fireundubh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:51:29 2015 UTC,I didn't decry the paid mods notion because of the %age. I did so because the fiscal motive would destroy the non-profit motive. Which would kill the mod scene for me. People stop making what they want to make and replace that with the minimum that will make a buck.  I'm having nothing to do with any game with a paid mod scene.

People stop making what they want to make and replace that with the minimum that will make a buck.   Of the 40,000 Skyrim mods on the Nexus, how many do you think are in any way substantial? Very few, relatively speaking. The fact is that revenue sharing would serve as an incentive  that would result in not just more mods but more mods of greater quality.  Yes, there would be a lot of noise, as there always is regardless of the price—just look through the free and paid app sections of a major app store—but the signal would much higher toward the front, where the best mods, both free and paid, would migrate.

Bash patches can alter the crime radius, but I don't believe it can change who is and isnt witnesses.

Vigilants of Stendarr would be sensible for all of them. The Black Star might bring the attention of followers of Azura, enraged at the desecration of her artifact. Maybe try to tailor the type of people coming after each artifact to the artifact, like, people coming at you for the Spellbreaker would use a certain amount of magic, and ones after the melee weapons would be warrior characters, and so on."

You also don't have all the unofficial patches, and you havent run the patch for dual sheath redux. I also recommend you turn off different ebony, glass varients and skyforge weapons and use the content addon again which has them all merged along with even more varients and is more supported and compatable with other mods.  Also according to modwatch, your skyrimprefs.ini has the data that should be in skyrim.ini so I suggest deleting the entire skyrimprefs.ini file and letting skyrim regenerate it when you next start it up"

skyrimmods,3dgseg,Elianora,5,Thu Jul 16 09:20:02 2015 UTC,"Hjalp    If Google Translate is to be believed, this is Finnish for ""classified ads"".  There are many reasons why this can occur, but with runes the rule of thumb is to copy and modify every element of its functionality: magiceffect, projectile, explosion, impactdata, impactdataset, impact mesh, decal. There are a ton of references between them and leaving out just one will break it.  The other thing is that the radius of a spell is set to 0 when you Ok out of the spell dialog. A radius of 0 means the explosion doesn't spawn and therefore epic fail. You need to open the spell a second time and Ok again without changing anything (about the magiceffects).

skyrimmods,3dgseg,EnaiSiaion,3,Thu Jul 16 05:57:07 2015 UTC,"Nothing about spells takes 10 minutes. You can bash together an effect, write a quick script and have ""a"" spell in 10 minutes, but making a spell that actually looks and feels satisfying requires quite a bit of iteration. Once you get into things like effect shaders and texture blend types, you have enough numbers to occupy yourself with for quite a while.  For instance, Fabricate Object in Apocalypse has a very simple effect, but the exact distance between caster and object took some iterating, as did the look of the effectshader. It still didn't look good enough because the object looked like it was hit by a spell instead of created by one, so I added that orb. What orb? The faint globe of green magic around the object. The one you probably didn't consciously notice. That was the second attempt; the first was a beam of light, which looked bad on horizontally shaped objects.  You can make a spell that just dumps an object at your feet in 10 minutes though and spend the remaining 3 hours on exciting and fulfilling new life experiences. That has some merit too."

skyrimmods,3dionj,YogaUppercut,3,Thu Jul 16 16:13:54 2015 UTC,"To echo the consensus I'm on the Deadly Dragons + Dragon Combat Overhaul board, and have been for a while despite anything else coming out. I also use Dovahkriid, which gives a handful of specific and very strong named boss dragons which start spawning at appropriate points in the main quest storyline. As for my thoughts on some of the other popular dragon mods...  In my eyes, Elemental Dragons is a bit too out there. Its loot is ridiculous, its dragons are ridiculous. I get people want more dragon variety, but I go for quality over quantity and Elemental Dragons feels kinda ridiculous. Fat dragons? Bomber dragons? Completely overpowered loot? None of this is well integrated into the game in a lore-friendly manner. None of it fits thematically. Not my cup of tea.   Ultimate Dragons is an interesting mod by an interesting mod author, but it's a solution looking for a problem. There just isn't a niche for it. DCO already solved dragon AI, and did it fucking beautifully. Ultimate Dragons may surpass DCO in features and design eventually, but right now it's just another overhaul that just isn't as good as DCO in any way.   Enhanced Mighty Dragons replaces existing dragons rather than adding new variety, which I'm not a fan of. The existing dragon archetypes are fine. And boosting their stats is solved in a configurable manner by Deadly Dragons -- which also fills the niche of adding more dragon variety.   There are some other mods that add more dragon variety, like Bellyache's, but I haven't given them much of a try. Most of them seem to center around more visual variety, which is already solved in a dynamic manner by The Dragon Engine. So if you're looking for more aesthetic variety, check that out. Excellent little mod.   Deadly Dragons on the other hand actually fills the niche of expanding the variety of dragon archetypes. It's not just an expanded collection of fire and frost dragons, but actually adds really cool stuff like forest dragons and spectral dragons and nether dragons -- all of which are well integrated, not overdone, and feel like they've belonged in the game all along.   As for my reasoning on DCO -- if you haven't try it, go through a playthrough with it now. Dragons were seriously one of the most deficient parts of vanilla. Their AI was terrible and predictable. They consistently landed at around 30-40% health and just waited to die. No part of their behavior made for anything close to an interesting battle. They need an AI overhaul way more than they need a stat boost, and DCO did that so damned well. Dragons are actually intelligent, unpredictable, and will seem to fight for their lives until the fight is over."
skyrimmods,3dionj,nefftd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:16:05 2015 UTC,"Awesome summery of the mods there, and I completely agree with you. But why does no one ever mention that DCO actually lets you kill dragons in the air instead of the vanilla game where you have to wait for them to land to die? XD"
skyrimmods,3dionj,Nazenn,2,Thu Jul 16 22:20:07 2015 UTC,"Deadly Dragons (normal version) and DCO for me.  Silly solution but you could just not deal with them until you can handle it? I know if I was a new adventurer, I'd turn and run tail until I thought my skills were adequate. Dragons shouldn't be something a level 5 can take on anyway.  Also, I play a light armored character as well and I mostly just avoid them landing near me and I use cover as much as I can."
skyrimmods,3dionj,Sable17,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:19:30 2015 UTC,"Now that I really think about it, it's mostly Bellyache's that has been giving such hellish synergy problems with Dragons. If it were just as easy as running away from one dragon, I wouldn't have a problem, but often running away from one will eventually lead me to the aggro radius of another, or a pack of 3 lesser dragons. I will look into Deadly Dragons."
skyrimmods,3dionj,Sable17,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:32:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I also drop DCO's reinforcement feature in the MCM. To me I don't see a dragon as the type to call in reinforcements. Too proud and all that.  Just remember to disable Deadly Dragon's assault feature in the MCM, since DCO has it already."
skyrimmods,3dionj,glenchild,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:41:40 2015 UTC,"^ I use this combo, too. Gives me a hella lot of control over how many dragons I face and how hard they are. I usually leave the Deadly Dragons stats at vanilla for Mirmulnir (he wrecks me every time! I don't know why), then gradually crank up the dragon stats as I get stronger."
skyrimmods,3dionj,Stairmasternem,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:48:48 2015 UTC,"For a while I was using Dragon Combat Overhaul paired with Deadly Dragons. Using this pair up, I forgot to configure DCO's assault settings (One dragon? Two Dragon? THREE DRAGON?!) and it was assault trigger time. So unless I went back millions of saves, I had to deal with the following spawn: an ice dragon, a forest dragon, and a nether dragon.Even with the DD set to vanilla, its new dragons murdered me and everyone around.  Now I'm using DCO with Chaos Dragons (it sounded interesting). Right now I'm debating whether I want to keep it or not. The damage dragons do is about where I want it. Their armor rating is way too high for my liking though."
skyrimmods,3dionj,Laskeri,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:49:40 2015 UTC,"DCO+DD sounds pretty ideal actually. I really hate to drop Bellyache's since it's the most aesthetically pleasing Dragon mod, it has PLACED dragons (I disabled all random encounters), and they varied in difficulty quite a bit.  Unfortunately, the whole ""packs of 3 dragons"", and poor placement of strong dragons near early main questline makes this mod distasteful. Especially when coupled with things like DCO!"

DCO was nice, but a lot of the features overlapped with DD and it was breaking the Miraak fight for me. Apollo might've fixed that in the final versions, however.  I also didn't like the Soul Curse mechanic and since I dropped Souls to Skills I don't want to be penalized for extra souls."

skyrimmods,3dionj,Suicidal_Baby,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:51:48 2015 UTC,Ultimate Dragons has really poor A.I.  Ever wonder why the dragons just sit there for long periods of time?
skyrimmods,3dionj,Vorthas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:09:15 2015 UTC,"Yea that is probably the only issue, but I was able to mostly fix it by putting dragon flight on vanilla in the MCM menu.  But I wanted something that was compatible with Chaos Dragons, which Deadly Dragons is not."
skyrimmods,3dionj,Suicidal_Baby,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:21:13 2015 UTC,"So it does nothing in the air instead of the ground?  Deadly dragons alters stats and items, which is why it's not compatible.  DCO alters A.I. Your purpose for one over the other is mistaken."
skyrimmods,3dionj,Suicidal_Baby,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:32:49 2015 UTC,"I mean Deadly Dragons isn't compatible with Chaos Dragons since it doesn't boost the health and damage of the dragons from Chaos Dragons.  Ultimate Dragons DOES boost the health of dragons from Chaos Dragons which is I what I want, while Enhanced Mighty Dragons increases the health even further AND increases their damage.  I hate it when dragons only have like 4k-6k health and I kill them in 10 shots or something.  I want dragons with 20k+ health so I can spend time killing them.  They're meant to be DRAGONS not cliffracer wannabes.  I may consider DCO sometime, but I've heard some bad things about it.  Supposedly some of the new moves it gives dragons are just a pain to deal with, such as constantly being knocked down and whatnot."
skyrimmods,3dionj,Suicidal_Baby,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:37:45 2015 UTC,blocking at the right time with heavy armor negates the knockdown.
skyrimmods,3dionj,Imadoc91,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:58:12 2015 UTC,"While that's all good an dandy for Heavy Armored Shield toting characters, Mages just get bitch slapped around with no way to avoid the knocked about feature. Even using dual wield Parry so I can block while holding a staff, I'm still thrown so far, I end up in the aggro radius of other enemies that gank me while I'm trying to deal with the Dragon. This could be so easily solved if the mage-armor spells gave you resistance/immunity to the knockdown or at least reduced it to stagger!  It's not only absurd shit some of the Dragons can do, but their swooping close to the ground AI bugged out pretty hard on me sometimes. Often they would dive farther down than ground level and resume flight patterns at face-height, or start flying in slow motion only after diving. It's not as configurable as I desperately wish it was, and that sucks because it really DID make some of the best Dragon fights.  PS: can anyone confirm if DCO still adds some of the more absurd shouts (Making explosive meteors rain from sky, turning nearby NPC's into werewolves, etc)?  Also, that moment when you realize you only ever play mages in Skyrim."
skyrimmods,3djhp1,McBoobenstein,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:44:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like a mod has to be causing infinite camera shake, but it doesn't seem like any of your mods would do that, so I can't really help fix that particular issue.  But perhaps you could try changing some of the fcamerashake gamesettings:  http://www.creationkit.com/Category:Settings  I say try, because a lot of gamesettings do nothing.  For now, try using console commands to change them and see if any of them actually work. Console command changes won't stick betwern saves though, but once you identify a working gamesetting, you can make a mod to change it permanently.  But yeah, LMK if you find a gamesetting that works. But you should still try to pinpoint the mod that's causing the shaking in the first place."

You can drop the ""probably"", and the ""outside religious ceremonies"".   Historical Vikings didn't wear horned helmets, period. There is absolutely zero archaeological evidence that they did, and it's a well-established fact that the ""viking horned helmet"" is a product of 1800s romanticism.   Say what you want about the Vikings, but they knew how to fight and they weren't particularly stupid. A horned helmet is in every way a liability in a fight."

No no nonono, it's not a case of ""we just don't know"". There's substantial evidence against horned helmets, and absolutely zero evidence for. The only intact viking helmet discovered so far, the Gjermundbu helmet, is without horns. The helmet fragments that have been found show no indication of horns either. Every single depiction of vikings predating the early 1800s show them not wearing horned helmets.   Furthermore, it would be extremely dangerous to wear in combat. You'd want a helmet that makes blows glance off your head, not one with protrusions that help guide the blade towards your skull. The horns would also make it easy for your opponent to knock your helmet off, unless of course it was strapped on securely, in which case ...well, if you've ever seen a rodeo, I'm sure you know how easily horns can be used for leverage.    Not the place for this...   Of course it is. Are you seriously trying to tell me that it's okay for you to misrepresent and caricature my heritage, but it's not okay for me to point it out and correct you?  A caricature is fine, as long as we all agree that it's a caricature. But when you start with your ""probably"" and your ""outside religious ceremonies"", then it stops being fine. Vikings didn't wear horned helmets, period. Ask any archaeologist or historian with knowledge of that region and period, and they'll tell you the same thing."

Sure, Skyrim might draw inspiration from ancient Scandinavian history and culture, but the game world is distinct and different from real-world history.  You could have easily asked for mods that add ""caricatured Viking helmets"" without suggesting that historical Vikings actually ever wore those. If you don't want your asinine statements challenged, maybe don't make them in the first place.    I have viking ancestry myself so you're not special.    I never claimed to be.

I see the reasoning for including them, but personally I prefer the swamp without them. Will that option be returning for this project as well?  Also, it seems like your work to this point has largely been accommodating -- or perhaps even to some degree designed around -- SFO. Will this project also play nice with SFO?"

I've not used it, and it is supposedly very taxing and performance heavy, but Sahrot Od Dein in Elianora's junkyard might fit the bill. Snowy area, lots of unique storage. Read more about it here (that blog lists several other homes good for displaying unique items, but Sahrot Od Dein is the only one in a snowy area). There is also Morskom Estate, although it probably wouldn't be considered ""no frills."" I've never personally used it and seems to also be performance heavy. Snowdrift Manor was an entry in the first of the subreddit's mod contests, and might fit the bill for you. Frostvale Estate may not count as no frills, either. But it has all that unique storage.   If I think of any more, I'll add them."

Kind of Binding of Isaac-y where each room is basic and surrounded by doors into the next room. With rooms of a small size, load times would be practically immediate and it might make randomizing everything a lot easier. This would also remove the need to make elaborate dungeons. I don't know, just my two cents.   I adore this idea for a mod by the way. I saw you mention it a while ago and I'm glad to see you want to move forward with it."

When you mentioned authors who have made dungeon mods in the past, I took it as meaning you wanted something a little larger behind each load door.  Designing basic rooms with basic lighting should be a snap once you get the hang of it. Lots of good tutorials on Youtube. It's mostly just a matter of learning the render window's controls and how each tile set goes together (which can admittedly be annoying) and then navmeshing it up.

As much as the repacker claims that it's a great service to everyone else -- especially newbies -- to create this unauthorized pack, supposedly to save time trying to get a perfect working combination, it takes away the need for the average modder to learn and understand the underlying mechanisms on how one mod is reliant to another, or why one mod can affect another's functionality; one small tweak will affect gameplay, for better or for worse.  Because this thing has a lot thrown in, without the modder knowing what's under the hood and how each mod works, I wouldn't surprised that somewhere there would be a damn glitch that can cause a CTD or screw up gameplay."

This will spawn you outside of riverwood with a few items.    tmm 1 - will enable all map markers so you can fast travel to an area to test it.  You will need to enable fast travel in Requiem's mcm menu.  player.setav speedmult 300 - will give you 3x movement speed.  400 = 4x, 100=default.  these are basic testing tools to get you around the world so you can see the impact of your mods before you begin your playthrough.  And what you ""reaalllly"" don't want, is for me to say you need to start over with Mod Organizer so you can more easily identify the problem with your game from now until the end of your computer's life."

Always start with the performance preset and turn effects on from there.  If you want to tune a specific setting, open ENB GUI and tweak it to your preference.  It's a preset, that just means it's a starting point.  This will teach you how much an individual setting affects your performance.  Then you can start doing research, see google, on what each setting does.  You may even end up making your own ENB some day."

skyrimmods,3deuwk,Suicidal_Baby,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:58:18 2015 UTC,"When ever you adjust ENB settings make sure you ""set timescale to 0"" in console as the passage of time may change which time of day you're adjusting. Default timescale is 20. It also helps to have the console open while you make changes so your character doesn't move around.  Start off by waiting till 12 noon, then you know you're only adjusting the Day settings.  Open ENB GUI with shift+enter. In the enbseries window, find the Environment section, find Point lighting. There are several settings you can adjust here. Just play around with them to see how everything works and find what you like. If you screw something up and forget the default value or just want to revert to your previous saved settings, just hit load settings in the enblocal window. When you want to save, hit save then apply in the enblocal window."
skyrimmods,3deuwk,Khugan,2,Wed Jul 15 22:05:39 2015 UTC,"In your enblocal.ini, what is ReservedMemorySizeMb=xx set to? I know that if this is set to low you can get stutter. You don't want it too high either.  I would suggest 128 and slowly work up by increments of 128, but no higher than 1k. Mine was, for some reason, set to 64 and I had this terrible micro stutter when I would pan my characters view; like a vibration almost. 128 cleared all that up for me. I still have noticeable slow downs in fps, but the stutter is at least, not contributing to it. This info is from a STEP Page  Oh, and unless something has changed software like Afterburner, or forced video driver settings should not be used with ENB.  EDIT: One last thing that can cause massive slow downs that one might not realize is the combination of two mods and a given ENB. SMIM, (Static Mesh Improvement Mod) specifically the chandelier 3d chain mesh combined with the shadow casting light changes from ELFX. Add the precise shadows from any ENB and you have a video card shitting itself. This can be seen in all it's glory in the underground living quarters in Jorvaskr. Just stare down the hall toward Kodlak. There is a third party fix for this and as of a few days ago Brumbek updated SMIM with new options for those meshes."

Something's up with your ENB config.  What's your VideoMemorySizeMb? Set it to about  ~3960. (it'll spike around 3600 MB usage anyways because of the 3.5 GB scandal I'm sure you are aware of). If that doesn't help, there's another issue.   While you're at it: use http://modwat.ch/. It's a quick program that'll upload your mod list and Skyrim and SkyrimPrefs INI files.

skyrimmods,3dfh4q,TeamPlayerSelect,2,Wed Jul 15 23:38:05 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought, originally. I know I didn't have one when I saw the option, and in this game where I can't see it, I did buy one to see but no luck. Haven't tested having one along with the tanning rack though.  From what I found on google, the Fur Crafting Kit is from the ""Winter is Coming"" cloaks, for crafting those."
skyrimmods,3dfh4q,TeamPlayerSelect,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:48:44 2015 UTC,As an update...   Tried 'Survival Skills' with Fur Crafting Kit from WiC mod - no luck. Actual tanning rack only shows Fur Plate as craftable under the 'Hide' category.   Is this perhaps a level thing? Must be at least level x to craft fur armor? I notice that there are also some new crafting books - normally there's just the Craftsmen Manual (Think that's Requiem or Frostfall) but now there's one or two more. Perhaps they are now required for the Fur crafting?
skyrimmods,3dgn1h,agginyadlla,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:00:02 2015 UTC,"I think what is missing from Skyrim modding (and  the community can correct me if I am wrong), is that Skyrim lacks truly relatable NPCs, and despite all the modding efforts to populate Skyrim, it still feels like an empty world out there.  Having played Sims 3 and being involved in their modding community (TS3 has excellent storyprogression mods that essentially plays out the lives of various in-game NPCs as if a human player was behind them), I admit I am very spoiled in that regards. Regardless, I think for Skyrim, that is out of the scope, but I think there could be various ways to upgrade the current system to make the world seem much more immersive.  I haven't yet installed Immersive Citizens, which I hear is great, primarily because it conflicts with ETaC. But what would like to specifically to see are:   NPC adventuring parties (rather than lone NPCs) that act and fight together intelligently. An option to make all of your followers into an independent kickass party and do stuff for you (such as radiant quests) would be nice in situations you just want to be alone. A more intelligent AI, particularly with respect to AI healers (there is currently no support outside of self-healing, and AIs can't heal each other) More interesting random dialogue and banter More interaction choices with NPCs, more along the lines of Sims, but not that extensive. Better follower support and interactions (like HUD that shows follower's health, and an easy way to track your followers). Also, support for a healer follower would be nice. Better worked out combat and magic system. A necromancy tree with various types of undead summons (skeleton warriors, archers, knights, mages, imperials) would be nice. More interesting enemy encounters. Ie, instead of imperials v stormcloaks all the time, I'd like to see forsworn v stormcloaks, vampires v werewolves, draugr v bandits, npc adventuring parties vs others,  giants v dragons, thalmor v orcs, etc. Also this game needs spears.

The same day, my sister was moving to a new flat with two of her friends. They didn't have internet so she asked to borrow one of the dvd's. So she calls me to ask and was hesitant. My mother convinced me to let her. I wasnt with them at the time so I didn't know that the dvd she took was the one with ""The Contest"" and ""The Bubble Boy"" (two of the highest rated episodes).  Jump to 3-4 months later and she moves out of the flat one reason or another. During the move I ask for the DVD back, she claimed it was still in the friends PS3 and she will get it for me next time she see's them.  jump to another 2-3 months and her friends are moving out. I ask her to get my dvd. when she returns from helping them move she says they couldn't find it. she tries to claim that its not her problem but after a hearty argument involving several people in the house we come to the conclusion that she has to buy the season so she can replace the dvd.  Since then I remind her every so often.  Jump to now I am done with waiting so now I am trying everything in my power to get her to buy the dvd. I am posting the dvd on her facebook everyday and I want to flood her Skyrim game with the dvd, therefor why I want the mod."

Which had a screen capture download from g2a, so a customer representative can give you the key and confirm that the key works because they watch you enter the key and see that it works.  I've bought over 50 games from g2a, with and without the guarantee system and never had an issue.  Even had them reverse a $50 purchase afterwards on a pre-purchase game, took 1hr for funds to be returned with no bs.  G2A customer service is damn good.  Make sure you only buy from 100% merchants on the list and use the g2a shield if you're concerned.  I don't use the shield on purchases under $10 as it becomes 10% of the cost.

skyrimmods,3df82y,CloneTwo7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:22:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't used Requiem at all but I've used both Skyre and Perma. For me Perma was easier to install and is easier to get modded armor/weapons to work with it. It also is compatible with a few newer mods like Wintermyst. However it seems that Skyre is a fuller more complete and more expanded overhaul. The Wayfarer perk tree is more fleshed (and actually works) in Skyre. In Perma I have about 20 hours on a brand new character and my wayfarer tree hasn't gone up at all. Perma introduces nice features with the use of Mastery skills and enchanted arrows, but Skyre is more finished and has more compatibility with other fleshed out mods. I'd recommend SKYRE for you because it seems like you want a slightly more challenging (But more interesting) play through. Skyre has cool features for all kinds of characters, Conjuration has some sweat necromancy perks, and having the Lock picking/Pick pocketing together makes easier to level up. Also Skyre is easier to tell what the perks actually do by giving you more numbers and stats and whatnot while Perma does an interesting thing where each perk has some sort of poetic proverb that you kinda have to decipher."

PerMa is fun, easier to install, yada yada yada. However, it is not bug free. There are some perks that don't work, and it is fairly unbalanced still.  SkyRe is basically a ""finished"" mod. It's mostly stable, and gives you a fresh take on Skyrim gameplay wise. You could use some of Skyre's stuff with PerMa's perks.  That said, the Third Race Skill overhaul is the best for a more vanilla feel. Don't have to worry about compatibility issues at all. Same with when the ordinator perk stuff comes out."

skyrimmods,3df82y,Operatics,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:47:19 2015 UTC,"The Wayfarer tree for one. The unarmed perks are just a mess (but that one is more not working due to balancing, not an actual bug itself.) Some of the thief perks are iffy (the arrows come to mind.) Smithing has some issues with it (some of which I can't think of at the moment.)  Don't get me wrong though, I like what it is doing. I see people complain that the patcher touches too much, but I also realized, after thinking about it, that it touches things because it has to. Would the Stealth Perks work if it didn't know ELFX was running?   I might try it again though. I've ran with it when it came out, then when it was updated the first time and gave up. TTRSO, in all honesty, seems to be the best choice if you want JUST a perk overhaul that's both balanced and true to vanilla...but PerMa is best if you want something completely different."

Requiem was interesting and well done, but it's initial difficulty doesn't last past Lv20-30 and it's downhill from there. There are a lot of features in Requiem that were nice, but unfortunately you have to take it all or none of it.  SkyRe and PerMa catered to my will of playing multiple characters with unique styles. I find that in PerMa especially (with the few tweaks I've made) gives me just enough perks that I would have a complete build at Lv50. Everything beyond that is icing.  However, PerMa by itself won't do everything for you. It's the centerpiece of a mod build, but it's far from the whole thing. You'll need a combat mod or two on top of it to get the difficulty you want."

You shouldn't downgrade again though, so it's always a good idea to keep an older savegame around in case you have to go back.    So looks like everyone can feel free to just go right ahead and install it. Personally I think the latest version looks absolutely fantastic and its nice to see everything so nicely rounded off and finished as it is"

They won't make that same mistake again. They'll do what they've done in the past - get the console users to pony up the cash, and when they prove willing, the PC users will want it too.

Other issue was that the modders were only getting a tiny fraction, Steam and Bethesda split the lion's share.  Other issue was that it attempted to set precedent that Bethesda owns the mods, rather than the modders themselves. This is a gigantic IP grab by big corporations of stuff they currently have no right to. Modders effectively fuck themselves by signing off on it.

I read the Steam Subscriber Agreement when the paid mod debacle went down: when we upload any mod to the Workshop, we grant Valve the right to distribute it, but that's about it (and even that right is set up to work in our favor).

You are correct in that they can't make you agree to something illegal or to something that would forfeit a Constitutional or statutory right. No EULA I've seen ever does this though, because they'd be sued into Oblivion over it."

There may be some overlap between the programmers that built the engine and the designers that built the content, but there are designers that didn't work on the engine. Furthermore, Bethesda distributes their games and DLC via Steam, Xbox LIVE, and PSN, and they own none of these networks. Now, I don't know if Bethesda's employees enjoy their jobs, but I certainly hope so.

I think the largest factor in bad pricing was the conflict between Bethesda, Valve, and the authors. Bethesda wanted a large (but justifiable) cut and Valve was too strict with the $100/mo payout quota. If Bethesda had reduced their cut or Valve had been less strict with the quota, then we would've started seeing prices drop as sellers got a better handle on how much people are willing/able to spend. We probably would've moved closer to microtransaction-style pricing, with offers like $1 for an armor set or even $1 for a whole bundle of armor sets."

skyrimmods,3d96kp,minidarknova,5,Tue Jul 14 22:33:47 2015 UTC,SKYUI 5.0!!
skyrimmods,3d96kp,BeetlecatOne,4,Wed Jul 15 04:21:05 2015 UTC,I am more excited about this than I was after I defended my dissertation. That's weird. And sad. But yay SkyUI 5.0.

skyrimmods,3d96kp,schlangster,22,Wed Jul 15 20:50:30 2015 UTC,"Version 5 includes better crafting, enchanting, alchemy and smithing menus and several other enhancements."
skyrimmods,3d96kp,BeetlecatOne,4,Tue Jul 14 15:19:08 2015 UTC,"Wait, what's the difference between the crafting and smithing menus? Both of the screenshots show the player crafting weapons."
skyrimmods,3d96kp,Xgatt,10,Tue Jul 14 21:21:48 2015 UTC,Before now they all used the vanilla menu interface. Now they've been SkyUIed.
skyrimmods,3d96kp,glonasett,3,Tue Jul 14 14:06:36 2015 UTC,"Crafting menus are all the ""Creation menus"" like enchanting, alchemy, etc."
skyrimmods,3d96kp,BeetlecatOne,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:07:55 2015 UTC,"Crafting is the item creation menus. Smithing is the item improvement menus, such as sharpening weapons or fitting armor at a workbench."
skyrimmods,3d96kp,Eddy_Sc,2,Tue Jul 14 14:26:55 2015 UTC,I have somehow thought that crafting / smithing was something that couldn't be altered? Am I thinking of some other aspect?
skyrimmods,3d96kp,piotrmil,7,Tue Jul 14 14:40:07 2015 UTC,"Almost anything can be altered, it's just a matter of how much effort it takes and whether anyone is motivated to do it.

skyrimmods,3d96kp,Mardoxx_,2,Tue Jul 14 14:21:55 2015 UTC,Finally! I'm glad they got their senses back and understood the idea of optional paying for a mod. Although that might have just been that ass Mardoxx.

I can totally understand where you were coming from and think it should have worked. I would have done the same if I had a popular mod at the time.  I hope to see it successfully implemented in another game, whether that be the next Elder Scrolls, Fallout or something else entirely like Portal or something.   Creators should be allowed to make money for their work and the market will determine if the quality of the work is worth the price."
skyrimmods,3d96kp,Mardoxx_,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:13:35 2015 UTC,"In theory it should have worked, and should have been a great addition to the community... but it wasn't, and there is just a plethora of compounding issues that caused it to be such a monumental fuck up.  I personally drew my line at taking existing free mods, and charging for them. Now most of the anger here should be directed at Bethesda and Valve for the modders they approached about this.  SkyUI (and many other release mods) already existed, they were always free. With the release of payed mods they took these 'products' and started charging money for what had historically been free.  A literal ""Fuck you pay me money"" to the people who use those mods.  Now if you developed something like SkyUI, or Falskaar, but never released it. It was never available for open beta testers, was never available on the nexus, had absolutely no history of being free; and started charging money for it?  I probably would've bought it. Why? Because it's like a player made expansion, it's not something that was free, but now isn't.  I honestly think the 'backlash' that these modders who took their existing mods and started to charge money for them was almost completely justified; albeit too extreme.  Now that being said, their move to start charging for their mods was also perfectly justified. I don't think there is a soul out there who would argue that these people don't deserve to make money from their mods.  The whole debackle was just a clusterfuck of poor choices and bad timing."
skyrimmods,3d96kp,schlangster,2,Tue Jul 14 16:48:38 2015 UTC,"At least when it happened, many people argued against their right to make money, even if it never existed before. Others said let us donate and decide for themselves, but I know many people that would do it through steam out of convenience but would never get around to donating via PayPal or any other mechanism, probably out of laziness."
skyrimmods,3d96kp,toxicunderGroov,2,Sat Jul 18 07:07:08 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly fair, Bethesda AND Valve both said that converting existing free mods into pay mods would not go over well with the fans. Which is why I didn't do that with one of my existing ones like I had considered. Cause they had a point and I realized it would be pretty bad form.  So I put one up that had never seen the light of day, and people were buying it like crazy for the 2 days this whole thing lasted, and I got a relatively small amount of hate. Mainly from the ""herp derp software wants to be free"" people we all end up ignoring anyway."
skyrimmods,3d96kp,burndtdan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:21:41 2015 UTC,"I personally drew my line at taking existing free mods, and charging for them. [...] SkyUI (and many other release mods) already existed, they were always free.

It was never available for open beta testers, was never available on the nexus, had absolutely no history of being free; and started charging money for it?   The mod authors never intended to monetize content that they already released, SkyUI 4.1 was always going to be freeware. From the modders point of view, SkyUI 4.1 was the last update they would ever create.  Then Bethesda/Steam approached them and they began working on SkyUI 5. This version ""was never released"", ""never available for open beta testers, was never available on the nexus"" and would never have seen the light of day without paid mods. And still you consider it a ""Fuck you pay me money""-move that ""the backlash [...] was almost completely justified"".  I am using your reasoning, but I just don't come to the same conclusion as you. I don't understand why they were so viciously attacked and I think Mardoxx_ was right: If the authors of one of the most popular and helpful mods received so much hate and vitriol even though they gave so much to the community, there was no real community to begin with."
skyrimmods,3d96kp,Mardoxx_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:02:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but updating existing content and creating something brand new are not the same thing.  And it seems like you missed that in my comment, because that's the entire point, that's where I drew my line.  That is why we're coming to different conclusions.  SkyUI 5 is as much an update to SkyUI as 4.1 was, and every other version before that (Except the first.). It was in absolutely no way something new, yes, it may have never been created if payed mods weren't introduced, but that doesn't make it something new."
skyrimmods,3d96kp,toxicunderGroov,2,Wed Jul 15 14:11:58 2015 UTC,"When updating, SkyUI gave an error related to ski_playerloadgamealias.pex.

Did i do something dumb again?"
skyrimmods,3d96kp,Terrorfox1234,3,Wed Jul 15 22:03:11 2015 UTC,Potentially. Probably wasn't your own fault though. Why did you have that file loose in the first place?  SkyUI is only a bsa and esp and no other files
skyrimmods,3d96kp,_Robbie,6,Wed Jul 15 16:18:22 2015 UTC,Could be loose files from the MCM SDK.
skyrimmods,3d96kp,Mardoxx_,3,Thu Jul 16 01:24:38 2015 UTC,"No idea, but i've read it often gets accidentally packed with a mod. So i still have the file?

skyrimmods,3d96kp,dragontology,2,Wed Jul 15 20:51:49 2015 UTC,"No, that won't be a problem. MCM is backward compatible and the API has not changed anyway.

Copyright prevents me from sharing these on the Nexus or anywhere else.    Jon Irenicus Sound pack for Additional Player Voices    Baldur's Gate 2 villain.  Great for Mage or Thief style playthrough.   Minsc & Boo Sound pack for Additonal Player Voices    Baldur's Gate 1 & 2 companion and his loyal hamster companion. Highly recommend: Floating Healthbars, Jaxonz Renamer and Teyahven- Standalone Rabbit Follower with this sound pack.  So you can rename and see the hamster, Boo.   Darkest Dungeon Sound Pack for Additional Player Voices    Dark and foreboding narration of your journey.  Works with any class.    Suggest difficult environment for this one.     Notes:   All files have been remastered and optimized to play as best they can given the limitations of the Skyrim engine.  Each pack includes BG2 stealth sounds as well as a mix of BG2 and NWN magic casting effects. Most of the files are 100% unique to that folder's trigger. So you wont get a lot of cross over between events.   If something is playing too often for you, all you have to do is go in and move the file out of the folder. Everything is in *.wav format so you can play them to identify the sound you heard in game.  Each folder can have 10 files to play and it's a simple 10% chance to play. Some are repeated, like the stealth sound. But I aimed for a minimal level of repetition. Some folders only have a couple of files because that trigger is repeated often during playthroughs and I didn't want to ruin the effect of the narrative with constant repetition."

Disabling some of the most intensive effects such as Depth of Field and Ambient Occlusion will usually bring your framerate back up.  There are plenty of lightweight gameplay ENBs such as Seasons of Skyrim, Ruvaak Dahmaan and Clarity which rarely if ever dip below 50 FPS on an above average system. For a game like Skyrim I find 40 FPS perfectly playable."

skyrimmods,3dd3kd,LifeOnMarsden,4,Wed Jul 15 11:18:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. Skyrim is one of those games where 60FPS isn't the be all and end all, it's not a fast paced game which requires super twitch reflexes, most of the time you're just wandering around the landscape so FPS as low as 30 won't hinder your experience at all, I'd much rather have a nice ENB, 2k textures and plenty of mods and play at 35-45 FPS than not have that and play at 60"

skyrimmods,3dd3kd,drs93,5,Wed Jul 15 20:02:05 2015 UTC,Why do you need 4k textures if your resolution is 2k? Sure it's nice for armor and such but I don't think you need 4k for everything. Maybe that will get you some more fps.
skyrimmods,3dd3kd,ScreamingFreakShow,3,Wed Jul 15 10:05:48 2015 UTC,"Texture resolution is different from your screen resolution. You can tell the difference between 2k and 4k textures with 1920x1080. Also, keep in mind that with textures, 4k means 4096x4096, not the screen resolution of 4096x2160."

And seriously, if you want to boost the FPS, the biggest culprit by far is the depth of field. Kill that and your framerate will rise rapidly. You could further boost it by killing the SSAO but at that point why use the ENB? Color correction?"
skyrimmods,3dd3kd,Thallassa,2,Wed Jul 15 15:06:46 2015 UTC,"ENB should drop the fps by 20-30 from wherever you're normally at. If you're normally well above 60, then you should stay near 60 with ENB. Even the most performance-nomming ENB only claim 40-50 fps, so if you're at 120 normally you should stay near 60 :P   This might be your issue: a very common issue with Nvidia Optimus, which you have since you're in a laptop with Nvidia dedicated GPU - ENB fucks with Nvidia Optimus. It doesn't happen to everyone, but what happens is if you run the normal, wrapper version of ENB, the game is forced to run on integrated graphics. Which of course, sucks as far as fps. If you get an FPS drop running ENBoost only (i.e. usepatchspeedhackwithoutgraphics=true in enblocal.ini), then this is definitely your problem.   If you launch the game and it says ""Intel Graphics blah blah blah"" then ENB is probably forcing you to use the wrong GPU. The easiest fix is to use the injector version of ENB instead of the wrapper version."

You can reduce this value if you are experiencing stuttering to reduce the bottleneck of offsetting textures to your ram.  3: No.    You should take a look at this video segment and this post which describe how to manage your Mod List priority order, the left hand side of Mod Organizer, in an organized fashion.  Please read the entire thread that I linked.  It's important that the Master files and Unofficial patches have nothing above them in the Mod List priority order, left pane, and are in the same order as they are in the Load order, right pane.  Managing your Priority order is as important as having LooT manage your load order.  It is a virtual installation order that you can manipulate in order to force the correct overwriting files you want to show up in the data tab, right side, which is the end result of your Mod List priority order. This freedom is just one of the bigger reasons why we use MO.  You can use my mod list as a reference for the folders being discussed in the thread I linked.  The blue bars signify the same folders from the thread and their position in my Mod List Priority order in Mod Organizer."
skyrimmods,3dej7e,Suicidal_Baby,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"Im not sure exactly how this will help, But i assume it will help me narrow down the issue easier. thank you. Il try and use your predone categories and rearrange after copying the current profile. Hopefully I will be able to narrow down my issues with that and the little tidbits I see scattered in your Mod List.   I see you have a bunch of instances where you merged a few files; Was this mostly done to reduce esp size and can it be done on simple things like beards and sg eyebrows in an easy fashion? (or possibly armor mods)  edit: I guess I should ask, what is a good testing regimen for mods? right now I have Dyndolod and Perkus maximus and, honestly, packaging them each time is very long process that leaves little time to test. any recommendations?"
skyrimmods,3dej7e,Suicidal_Baby,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:16:14 2015 UTC,"Well, your previous Unofficial patches are in the right spot.  Your current ones are not.  MO should be throwing you a warning here, but it might be misreading the fact that the old ones are there, just not activated.    Yeah, right now my actual list is around 530 ish mods with 380 esps.  All of my merges are within the same category for the most part.  You can use the handy merge script that is linked in the tools section.  And yes, brows, beards, and sg eyebrows merge nicely.  And with the new merge scripts, house and dungeon mods become fairly straightforward as well.  Equipment merges are fairly straight forward until you get in the realm of the patches that affect them.  When you merge equipment lists, the formids get renumbered, so the patches can't locate them.  So you'll want to carry the changes into the equipment mod in tes5edit if you can.  I leave mods that require more than 1 patch or patches that have more than 2 masters out of any merges.  Such as Immersive Armors & weapons.  It's just easier to not deal with the mess.  Don't forget to unpack the BSA files in their mod folders and delete the bsa so the merge can find the files it requires for the textures and what have you.  Load order placement is another thing you need to worry about.  I haven't done it with LooT .7 but it's suppose to be easier with that version.  Before you merge, always locate the mods in the load order after running loot so you have a good idea of what mods are going to be affected.  Again, the issue with patches.  Then place the mod in the right spot, which may need tweaking after you test it.  With MO, I make a new mod folder and name it after the patch.  I position it at the bottom of the category I'm working in, then place all of the mods in that category that were merged, below it.  Then right click, information, optional esps, and make the merged esps optional.  This creates a new folder and renames the esp so it wont be found, all in 1 click.  Really easy stuff that makes it a simple process to walk back any merges that don't work or even update the mods and the merge later on.  Testing is something that covers the before, during and after the merge.  I always check for errors in TES5edit before I merge.  And if there are any that I can't fix by removing the null values, I don't merge them.  At least not until I'm certain it's not an issue.  Some mods have null values attached to the resolution of effects or scripts.  It's rarely a problem if the mod is already functioning as normal.  Test the merge itself for errors when it's done and retest it on it's own after saving and placing it in the right spot in the mod list and load order.  Sometimes Tes5edit won't show errors on the merged esp until you start a new session.  Once you get everything in place, make a copy of the profile, disable the overhaul and its patches.  Test the merge.  Have a checklist of the mods you merged.  locate and make sure they made it into the game with the proper values.  And that's about it really.    MO just makes it so much easier these days."

So just open the console, type setessential + the base ID of the NPC you want to change (you can get this by clicking on them with the console open, by the help function, or off of their entry on the elder scrolls wiki; Ulfric for example is 000D0575) and then 0 to make them killable or 1 to make them unkillable. Should fix your problem.   Just to make sure, to make Ulfric unkillable open the console and type    setessential 000D0575 1   and just change the middle part for other NPCs."
skyrimmods,3dd3x2,fearsomeduckins,2,Wed Jul 15 11:01:37 2015 UTC,This is not accurate.  Children are normally NOT set to essential and the mod Killable Children only removes the Child flag on the child races (the engine is coded to prevent child flagged from taking damage).  The mod would not have anything to do with his problem; the ini change bEssentialtakedamage that you mentioned down below is the most likely culprit.

After watching the video you pretty much matched my perfect house verbatim sauna included. The only thing I cant tell from the video is if the crafting area has your excellent named crafting storage similar to Sicarius' Refuge (My favorite mod of yours btw love the aesthetic even for non Dark Brotherhood characters). Also is the basement only that small area? I always thought that having a place to take carcasses back (from hunterborn) to clean and dress would be a cool thing to have in house and the basement would be a perfect place for that if it were a little bigger.

skyrimmods,3de1bd,CloneTwo7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:18:50 2015 UTC,Might be easiest to just use the SKSE installer. You don't really need to install the scripts via MO. You'll only need to uninstall SKSE when the new SKSE build comes out and that'll be at least a few months. Unlike other mods you might change out all the time.   If you have the scripts from the old version of SKSE still in your data folder that could be causing this issue.

skyrimmods,3dbliu,Einmyra,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:51:50 2015 UTC,I think the problem with that would be conflicts with quests and other mods. I remember during the recent house contest that it was quite a challenge finding a suitable location that wouldn't conflict.
skyrimmods,3dbliu,shamaniacal,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:47:17 2015 UTC,"If you look at Lakeview Manor in the CK, you'll see that all the meshes are placed already, and simply disabled until the quest enables them.  It would be impossible to simply build this anywhere without setting up the meshes in each viable location, which would be a compatibility disaster.  Smaller building like shacks can be scripted to place where the player wants them, similarly to Frostfall's tents, but the entire Lakeview estate would be infeasible.    My recommendation is to look at the various ""build your own home"" mods on the nexus and choose one in a suitable location for your needs."

skyrimmods,3ddlb4,Kozar927,3,Wed Jul 15 13:05:11 2015 UTC,"Just a tip for the future, split your post into smaller paragraphs: nobody wants to read through a text wall.  As for your build:   You do NOT need more RAM. 8GB RAM is more than sufficient for Skyrim.   The components in your rig are all fine. An i5 is perfect. If you have 500 to spend, I'd recommend the following:    The GPU is the main component you need to upgrade and for modded Skyrim on your budget, you have 2 pertinent choices. 1) GTX 970 2) r9 390. A 970 will run most ENBs along with texture mods at 30-60FPS. An r9 390 may fare better because the extra VRAM will help if you overload your game with mods. Overall, both will perform similarly. Buy an SSD: it helps with load times   You shouldn't need to spend more than ~$350 for a new GPU and a decent ~250GB SSD should run you around ~$100. At most you'll still end up under budget."

skyrimmods,3ddlb4,Ferethis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:21:36 2015 UTC,This really surprises me. The guy who sold me this PC from best buy last year warned me up and down the CPU is shit for gaming. If my PC is so good why do I run my load order at 5 FPS with constant crashing when I follow the real vision enb exact install order guide and other people run it fine... Is my 8gb of ram really the only problem? Maybe I should get an Nvidia card. I also cant run alot of new games with anywhere near respectable FPS like the witcher 3 etc. but skyrim is my main priority. You saw it was the i5-4430. Is that maybe a bad i5 or something. Btw I run something like 300 mods but I know that currently seems more common practice in the modding community then anything. How can I throw money at this problem? lol
skyrimmods,3ddlb4,_Hedonism_,5,Wed Jul 15 13:28:12 2015 UTC,"The sales guy was trying to get you to buy a more expensive computer. No CPU available now will give you a significant increase over what you have, especially in Skyrim.  A RAM upgrade will probably make the game seem smoother, but will not be a significant or even noticeable performance (FPS) gain.  enb is optimized for NVidia as that's what Boris uses, but tons of people run it on AMD GPUs without issue. I have no idea where a 7700 is on the performance scale, but I would think you certainly should be getting more than 5 FPS.  I have a friend running Witcher 3 at 1440 on a 2GB 760 and while not great, he says it certainly playable. I hate to say it but I'm thinking you may have either a hardware/config issue."

skyrimmods,3dale7,RoosterCogburno,3,Tue Jul 14 20:02:46 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to copy paste my mini review of this mod here so people can get an idea of just how much I like it:  This is a FANTASTIC house mod. Every part of it fits in and feels complete and feels welcoming without being too over the top or in your face. I like it so much I actually am going to give a total review on the mod  One of the things I love most about this is its simplicity. It's neat without being bare bones, and its also welcoming without being in your face. It covers all of the essential tools and stations and does so in a logical format when it comes to their placement not only to each other but in regards to the house as a whole and to storage as well, so its nice to see that it was clearly very thoroughly thought out in regards to how people could walk around it. That same care is carried outside as well I feel with a properly thought out path way and walkways. Small little touches are what made this house fantastic for me, the three planters near the alchemy table, the dragon claw display being made partly out of one of the doors they unlock which I absolutely LOVED, and all those little touches. I actually really enjoyed the weapon displays being indicated by a part of the model of the warhammer for each weapon type, although it did make it painfully clear to me that I don't appear to have an ebony texture replacer in my game right now (whoops). All of the little things hidden around the house to be noticed like secret door ways was great as well. Each little alcove in the Hall was great as it was just nice and contained and allowed you to have a broad style for each display section without worrying about the design clashing. I liked the book shelves that were literally shelves as well, a nice little unique touch that makes them effectively multipurpose when combined with Jaxonz Positioner or Unlimited Bookshelves. Overall just some really awesome and REALLY well put together concepts and implementation here and I will happily keep this in my MO for future usage.

They're clinically immortal, and will only die to severe bodily harm. Even then, they'll only be mostly dead unless they were killed by another Dragon. If the Dragonborn dies to a mortal, then they can be brought back by a Dragon who knows Alduin's Shout.  Based on the Lore we've got for Hjalti Early-Beard (Tiber Septim), the Dragonborn don't age. Tiber Septim died of needing to die in order for the world to move on. His continued existence as a Living God was holding the world back. His presence stabilized the world, and the world needed change in order for its people to grow. He willed his mortal body to die so that the wheel would continue to spin.  Hjalti does will himself back into existence from time to time. Once to talk to the Nerevarine, and again to guide the Hero of Kvatch against the returned Umaril the Unfettered."

It's also specifically stated that his God was in Red Mountain, which implies a connection to The Greedy Man/Lorkhan.  It's more likley that Hjalti was Dragonborn, Wulfharth/Ysmir was a Shezzarine, and Zurin was an aspect of Magnus.

Yes, they did redo Convention, with Hjalti the Thief betraying Wulfharth the Warrior while Zurin the Mage witnessed it. Talos Walked in every way possible.  I still doubt Hjalti was born with the soul of a Dragon. Otherwise he wouldn't have needed Wulfharths Thu'um. Tiber Septim was a Dragonborn as much as a story can be.

The player never really gets a chance to make something non-canon happen.     In Morrowind, you can kill Vivec, or not. But after Morrowind, Vivec is gone. In Oblivion, you can mantle Sheogorath, or not. But after Oblivion, Jyggalag is free and Sheogorath now exists as separate from him. In Skyrim, you can do the Dark Brotherhood quest, or not, but after Skyrim, Titus Mede II is dead.    These are not meaningful choices. If you didn't kill Titus II, some other assassin did. You do not have the option of preventing his death.    [Edit] Which brings us back to Bethesda not being big on 'options'. I would agree with that, in this sense."

Or like in Dead Money or any of the companion quests where there are good endings, shitty endings, or endings where they die.   All in all TES 6 is going to have to determine whether or not the imperials beat the stormcloaks or vice versa, if the Dawnguard overcame the vampires or if they managed to block out the sun, whether or not Paarthurnax lived or died, etc.   So I guess it'd be more along those lines."
skyrimmods,3d7zsl,rocktheprovince,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:18:40 2015 UTC,"true. i've had a lot of conversations on /r/teslore about how it seems likely the dragonborn will have had very little effect on the actual outcome of the war.    whether the stormcloaks win or lose, the thalmor pretty much win (maybe because no one bothered exposing those dossiers, cough). but i guess Bethesda could also choose to give one side a canon victory. we'll just have to wait and see."

If I had to guess, I'd give cannon to the NCR. And in Skyrim's case I'd give cannon to the imperials. Independent Mojave/ Independent Skyrim would be really cool stories down the road but I think they're going to stick closer to centrism, if that makes sense."

But how much of the staff of Bethesda Game Studios that worked on Skyrim has been there since Daggerfall? Not much, the studio has grown in size considerably and key members from that original team going back to Arena have left. Is it fair to say that The Elder Scrolls has a history of this kind of gameplay? Yeah of course, but that doesn't mean they have any obligation to continue to produce it, when their priorities have clearly shifted over the years."

skyrimmods,3d7zsl,rocktheprovince,3,Tue Jul 14 18:08:52 2015 UTC,"Daggerfall is this close to being my favorite TES game. It has a spectacular character creation system, an excellent story, massive world, and... the absolute worst dungeon design I've ever seen in a video game. The procedural generation is a complete joke: it's not unusual to come across a dungeon where the quest item is literally unreachable without cheats. And the dungeon map system is beyond worthless, to make matters even worse (a pity, since I think the town maps are spectacular).  It's also a very different beast from modern TES games. It's open world, yes, but it doesn't focus on exploration. It's still much more of an old school RPG at heart. And it's incredibly buggy. But I love what it's trying to do, and it can be a hell of a lot of fun if you're patient with it (and willing to use cheats), and I do feel that it's worth a look."

That said, I'm surprised it'd make you feel sick to your stomach. It's very old-school, obviously there's no graphics to speak of and the mechanics are very different from what we're used to now. But it was a good game at the time, as far as I know."
skyrimmods,3d7zsl,Thallassa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:15:54 2015 UTC,"Sick to my stomach was probably too snarky. I really do enjoy older games, like for example I'm all into /r/2007scape (which is really much older than 2007) and the older Fallouts. In Daggerfall the two things I noticed were horrible lag to the point it seemed like it was a really long slideshow, and the fact that combat isn't very fluid and people just burst into a pile of red when they die. It looks like it could be really cool if it was turn based."

skyrimmods,3d7zsl,TuxedoMarty,11,Tue Jul 14 23:27:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Ulfric is perfectly aware that the Thalmor are profiting from the war. There's no way both sides would realistically make peace just out of a mutual dislike of the Aldmeri. Remember the Empire wants his head (and almost got it). Ulfric is in this war to win, because it's his best chance of staying alive with honor. The Thalmor are a secondary concern for him. The Empire is in the war to maintain control of their rogue province, they're perfectly aware, more than anyone, that the rebellion jeopardizes their situation with regard to the Thalmor.  It's a nice idea, but the dossier changes nothing."
skyrimmods,3d7zsl,Logalog9,13,Tue Jul 14 23:32:04 2015 UTC,"Even though Ulfric seems to care about Skyrim, it's pretty clear that were he High-King the rest of Skyrim would become like Windhelm. After questing and exploring Windhelm, it became obvious to me that Ulfric only cared for himself, not his people. A boy is trying to summon the Dark Brotherhood, there is a murderer in the streets, even Pirates are stealing shipments. Windhelm has more major issues than other parts of Skyrim. This goes without mentioning the Dunmer slumming in the streets and the Argonians outright banned.  All these, and his behavior at the meeting during ""Season Unending"" lead me to think Ulfric himself won't see reason, even if you tell him he is being played, he might just spit at it and claim he was playing the Altmer. He's far too proud of his ""Nord Heritage"" to even consider that he was being manipulated. Either side you pick though, both sides steel themselves for the coming of another Great War.  I personally would like there to be a mod that adds the moot in some way (re-voicing many Jarls if it came to it) and allows you to have some sort of input, regardless of standing in the war. Or even an option to spare the opposing faction's leader.  I digress, this would still be a cool quest, rather you show the dossier to Ulfric or Tullius, even if nothing were to come of it. It would have added a little bit of flavor to the Civil War. Overall, a Civil War overhaul that adds this and many other flavor quests would be amazing. Really good suggestion OP."
skyrimmods,3d7zsl,XanZayora,7,Tue Jul 14 23:21:15 2015 UTC,"even if you tell him he is being played, he might just spit at it and claim he was playing the Altmer.   That would be why OP suggested a few speech checks should be involved.  They don't necessarily have to be easy speech checks.  IMO, his selfishness might actually make it easier to convince him - since he's likely to be angry at the revelation that the Thalmor manipulated and lied to him, and at how the Thalmor think they are using him now even if he doesn't think it is working.  What might be really interesting is the possibility of latent controls remaining from when he was broken - an Ulfric cooperating against the Thalmor might suddenly become very uncooperative indeed."
skyrimmods,3d7zsl,keypuncher,3,Tue Jul 14 10:05:25 2015 UTC,"A Speech check would be fine. It would certainly be fun to see him turn this war on it's head.

Maybe if you could show him the Dossier during ""Season Unending"", or just bring it up to both parties in front of Elenwen.

It's better to be a poor Dunmer in Windhelm than a poor Reachman in Markarth. There's an insurgency of daedra-worshipping terrorists, a cult of daedra-worshipping cannibals, active Thalmor agents, political corruption, etc."

skyrimmods,3d7zsl,Clad_in_Plaid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:22:03 2015 UTC,"I dunno, Windhelm seems to be a bit tame compared to other places. In Markarth, there is wide-spread corruption, multiple daedric influences, and the forsworn. In Riften, you got the Thieves' Guild literally right under the city and a woman who can pay them, the Dark Brotherhood, and the guards so she can do whatever she wants. Winterhold is halfway into the sea. You see what I mean?  ""Ulfric only cared for himself, not his people."" I disagree. He has a war to run, so I can understand some neglect on his part. The issues it has going are not as bad as the things I outlined earlier. The Dunmer are in the slums because Ulfric probably didn't expect Morrowind to become inhospitable and its people to flood into his city. The Argonians are on the docks because there is no space in the city and the Dunmer and Argonians hate each other. If they were to both be put in the slums the gray quarter would be a bloodbath. I do agree with the pride thing though."
skyrimmods,3d7zsl,EnaiSiaion,3,Tue Jul 14 22:03:32 2015 UTC,"It is unrealistic to believe that all would be rainbows and sunshine if only you could show that dossier to the two squabbling kids. If it did, the Greek problems would be solved by pointing out that Russia benefits from a Greek exit and China benefits from infighting.  Firstly, they still killed thousands of each other and won't just forget this. They would probably just accuse the other of scheming with the Thalmor and resume fighting.  Secondly, Ulfric probably wouldn't care that his actions benefit the Thalmor. Any third party that may backstab the Empire is a good ally, and the Empire is the bigger problem right now. Not that he wouldn't want to make himself a necklace of elf ears, but taking on the Empire first and leave the Thalmor untouched until later would look like a great strategy. Not like a bunch of pointy ears could ever pose a threat to a True Nord™, right?  And Tullius would at best consider Ulfric a misguided moron and at worst see a conspiracy to destroy the Empire. Provided with this evidence, the Emperor decides to send his armada and invade Summerset in self defence. Well done, Mr. World War.  That is if you haven't chosen a side yet. If you did, the side you're aligned with would bellow out that the other side are puppets of the Thalmor, while the other side would tell you ""nice try"" and execute you for treason.  In short, it is very unlikely that presenting this dossier would accomplish anything good, and several paths that lead to an escalation of the conflict. That's why you can't do this. Bethesda allows you to back out of a wedding and added dozens of random encounters, if they wanted a third choice leading to a Hollywood ending, they would have added one."
skyrimmods,3d7zsl,EnaiSiaion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:48:54 2015 UTC,"Addendum: I do think altering the outcome of the war should accomplish something meaningful. The Dragonborn is an agent of Fate and influences the course of history; winning an irrelevant war just so your side can get run over by the Thalmor afterwards is not dramatic enough.  Let the war pan out as it currently does, but add a final quest to establish that your contribution to the war effort allowed your side to win quickly and perhaps remain strong enough to take on the Thalmor.  I'm sure the Dragonborn's role in history is not to set up mankind to get conquered by the Thalmor. Because if the Thalmor get their way, they would destroy all of creation for religious reasons. It doesn't seem like the Dragonborn was intended to save the world by stopping Alduin and then indirectly enable the Thalmor to destroy the world instead."
skyrimmods,3d7zsl,teardeem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:11:19 2015 UTC,I like this idea. It would be nice for the leaders to acknowledge the threat of the Thalmor for some added closure after the war.

Each of the Jarls could have their own conditions for denouncing Ulfric; like maybe he has some damning blackmail on the Jarl of Riften and the Dragonborn needs to destroy the evidence before she'll leave the Stormcloaks.  Or perhaps the Jarl of Winterhold was promised money and manpower to help rebuild his hold, and the Dragonborn needs to come up with a suitable alternative.   After you get the first Jarl to switch sides Ulfric will intermittently send Stormcloak assassins.  After you get the second one the Thalmor start doing so as well.    Once the third Jarl has left there could be a bit where you convince Ulfric's second in command that, for the good of Skyrim, Ulfirc needs to disappear, with a choice of allowing him to escape into exile or killing him.  Something like that."

Scroll down and copy the list of mods to your Windows Word program then close the pop up so you can move them yourself.  Otherwise MO can and will flip entire sections of the mod list with the ones it wants in a specific order.  The controlling factor that determines the actual order is what you want to end up in the game.  Right click on a mod with a lightning bolt, hit information, then the conflicts tab.

skyrimmods,3dc9qe,Diablo_Cow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:40:07 2015 UTC,"CTD on save means you have to disable mods until it starts saving, find the culprit and work out why it's doing that. Typically it's too many script heavy mods stressing papyrus at once."
skyrimmods,3dc65d,superatt,3,Wed Jul 15 03:09:40 2015 UTC,"Try a run through TES5Edit. Most likely a missing master file. TES5Edit should throw up an error to which one you're missing.  On a side note, you may as well grab the Unofficial Hearthfire Patch as well."
skyrimmods,3dc65d,Sable17,2,Wed Jul 15 03:18:25 2015 UTC,"Wrye Bash is a lot quicker and easier for missing masters. You just look for the red checkboxes. It even tells you which mods have out of order masters with orange checkboxes, although master order often doesn't matter that much."
skyrimmods,3dc65d,Moonburn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:28:13 2015 UTC,"I opened up Wryre Bash and there are no red checkboxes, only orange ones on Requiem for the indifferent (which is at the very bottom of my load order, but according to TES5edit I need to get Requiem immersive horses, but whenever I try to install Another Requiem Patch Central with NMM it says ""The mod was not activated"") and RSChildren_PatchUSKP (which is correctly under RSkyrimChildren.esm) and  WATER DG + DB.esp (Which I unticked along with all the other WATER patches and the main file because I wanted to use purewaters instead)  I bolded the words in brackets to make it easier to read."

skyrimmods,3dc65d,Thallassa,2,Wed Jul 15 04:04:30 2015 UTC,Hrm. That's strange. Was the download corrupted?   Another thing. You're using two different water mods. WATER and Purewaters. Gotta pick one. Make sure you remove any patches for whichever one you drop.
skyrimmods,3d852m,Grimy_Bunyip,8,Tue Jul 14 06:45:36 2015 UTC,"Go dude, I like this idea."
skyrimmods,3d852m,fadingsignal,5,Tue Jul 14 07:33:50 2015 UTC,"I fully support the idea, but have one question. What I'm curious to know how the loading of the presets would be handled. Are all mods trying to load their preset all at once or would they get queued? I would imagine that someone with a massive mod-build could run into issues if the loading isn't managed.  I don't know how Skyrim/FISS/JContainer handles these things, this is why I'm asking. ^"
skyrimmods,3d852m,Netrve,2,Tue Jul 14 12:49:55 2015 UTC,"Skyrim would handle it by multi-threading.  It might be slow having all the menus load at the same time, but I don't think any modder would want to abuse the mod event by calling it constantly. The only time it should be used is when a button is clicked in an MCM menu, in which case the user should have some free time to wait for the loading to resolve."
skyrimmods,3d852m,Netrve,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:41:25 2015 UTC,"Would that be sufficient?  I experienced crashes, because of too many simultaneous scripts running. Those weren't errors or misbehaving scripts, there were just too many. This occurs mostly on new games, since all the mods try to start their scripts at the same time and cause the scripting engine to freeze and thus crash.  I fixed it by deactivating mods and turning them on later.  Maybe because I'm running an extensive amount of mods, some of which are script heavy like Wet and Cold, Frostfall, More Complex Needs, Skyrim Immersive Creatures, Trade Routes and/or Immersive Armors.  This is why I'm asking and my major reason of concern."
skyrimmods,3d852m,Netrve,3,Tue Jul 14 15:33:22 2015 UTC,"Weird, I suspect there is more to it than that. Since just calling a bunch of scripts to run simultaneously is the premise behind multi-threading. The thread manager is supposed to handle any complexity beyond that for us.  Either way, if SkyTweak doesn't have issues loading from FISS, and most mods won't come close to SkyTweak's number of variables, I kind of doubt there would be any major issues."
skyrimmods,3d852m,kirivark,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:40:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanations and your time.  I will take a closer look at my crashes the next time, maybe I missed something, but I'm pretty sure that I had no warnings or errors within my log. Maybe a RAM issue (not enough RAM allocated?)? I'm not sure, but next time it happens I will take my time, collect everything and make a thread here. Maybe others see what I missed. ^  Cheers!"

skyrimmods,3d852m,RS_Larka,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:51:26 2015 UTC,"Is there any reason why FISS/JContainers can't merge their capabilities into a single over-package? Picking the most efficient and most robust pieces from each?  I just get the impression that their is significant overlap in function/capabilities between the two (under the hood that is). I'm not a script modder, yet (still working on learning this stuff) so I am not sure about this."

skyrimmods,3dau8e,_Hedonism_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:04:02 2015 UTC,"Revert to a previous save, most likely. Uninstalling mods left right and centre is the one thing you NEVER do, ever.   Once you uninstall a mod, any save that was using it should be compromised. The more complex the mod, the more compromised its going to be. Simple mods you might get away with (but its still better to just not do it). Complicated mods with scripts will fuck you up, and require careful cleaning with script cleaner. Even then, you've probably made your safe unstable in the long term."
skyrimmods,3dau8e,Suicidal_Baby,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:45:34 2015 UTC,Upload a couple of the save files somewhere and I'll try to clean it.  I have the tools to do it and a bit of experience with fucking saves up beyond recognition.

When you find the record, just edit the value for duration.  The magnitude will be the total value used over the time of the duration.  So you can adjust the magnitude to balance as well."
skyrimmods,3dapsm,thatchairman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:32:40 2015 UTC,"Personally I prefer short spears that come with PerMa. That way it's not so clunky and slow and it looks a lot better. You can also use racemenu and the xps32 extended skeleton plugins to make the spears bigger and place them anywhere on your body. So you can mkae those short spears into one handed long spears. and use a shield, magic, or nothing in the offhand"
skyrimmods,3dapsm,Jack_Hat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:57:12 2015 UTC,"Forget spears. Skyrim uses a very simplistic hitscan test (is there an enemy under the crosshair) to determine whether you hit something with a weapon, so even with different animations spears will function exactly the same as every other weapon.  If you want a weapon mod that actually changes your playstyle, go with Throwing Weapons Redux which adds not just craftable throwing axes, knives and javelins, but also alchemical grenades.  If you are still hankering after some polearm combat, then you should seriously check out Dark Souls for some spears and halberds. Dark Souls 1/2 have fully fleshed out combat animations for each weapon type with proper physics and hit detection, and possibly the best combat system of any medieval fantasy style game."

skyrimmods,3dak4a,Judah_PO,2,Tue Jul 14 19:53:58 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure SkyUI lets you do this in the favorites menu. You can create a group of items that all get equipped using a hotkey.
skyrimmods,3dak4a,Furaigon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:28:10 2015 UTC,"FYI yes, not only does it do armor, but it allows you to set weapons and magic as well (though magic is kind of weird).   It binds by default to F1-F4 I believe, and I think it's even possible to expand it to all the F keys.  EDIT: for the op, as an example. I made a 2-hander orc and have a full set of heavy armor bound to it for ""Group 1"" [tied to F1], but I like to do Restoration too much to pass it up (and conjuration for soul trap), so I have one of those generic robes, some goofy helm with magica regen, and healing for Group 2.

skyrimmods,3darm0,despach,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:14:36 2015 UTC,That's unlikely to be find as it is not in his esp list.  More likely it is Victoria's walk or similar which is just animation files.  Look in your meshes animations female folder for walkforward etc.  Or better still install 360 run walk.  Good animation for both sexes.
