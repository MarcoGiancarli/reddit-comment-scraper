Pretty much nothing listed there is ""so specific it only applies to a couple of bands at a time"". Most of them are incredibly broad with vast amount of room for differentiation.  The only things really questionable there are ""progressive metal"" which is usually just a more complicated way of composing a genre, but not a genre on its own, ""viking metal"" which is a common specification of folk metal, ""glam metal"" which is more of a visual theme, and  ""extreme metal"" which is just a catch all between death, black and thrash.

If you think it should be a hard G, then say it that way. If you prefer it with a soft G, go right ahead. There's no reason to be a crybaby over it.

killthosewhodisagree,358zl0,iamaneviltaco,6,Fri May 8 18:09:44 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is that people shouldn't be punished for not respecting a symbol that means different things to different people, burning a flag doesn't hurt anyone, if someone chooses to take offence from a flag being trashed, then that's their problem, it's part of freedom of expression and speech, which the US usually tries to place in high regard. And the fact that an inanimate bit of cloth is more protected than the right for someone to do what they want with said cloth (that they purchased), is what bothers people.   If the Westboro baptists have the protected rights to protest the funerals of US troops and claim it's because of gay people (which is offensive harmful propaganda even if nobody takes them seriously) people should also have the right to trash a flag. Essentially it says that the flag needs to be respected but the citizens (including the soldiers who died for their country) don't need to be."

When taking quotes of the Bible you also have to look at the context. So in that context he is talking about those who will accept him, and those who will rebuke him. He says in the next verse  For I have come to turn  “‘a man against his father,     a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—     a man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.’  His visit will separate and divide, because some will not accept him as the son of God. His visit will cause chaos and hate, and may very well cause conflict between family members, there cannot be good if there is no evil, and he knows this, that's why he says he did not come to bring peace, he came to bring a sword, the sword meaning the separation and division   That's as best as I can personally describe it, he knows his coming and being the son of God will cause strife.

The interpretation of the old testament you and the Jews had for the prophecies of their messiah as a violent character   Then the dude is like ""eye for an eye? How about turn the other cheek"", ""I've come to fulfil the scriptures, but not in the way you expect"", ""God's taking his love and grace to the gentiles if you don't accept it, like a wedding planner giving invites to those on the street when his friends decline""  With your interpretation he's kinda the most un-old-testament guy in the bible, which is why the Jews had him nailed to a tree after all - he couldn't have been the Messiah if he acted like that, blasphemy.

Secondly, those to whom the base definition of a group of people applies are included in that group, and the No True Scotsman fallacy occurs when people try to make exceptions that stray from that base definition. The de facto example is as follows:  Person A: ""No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.""   Person B: ""But my uncle Angus likes sugar with his porridge.""   Person A: ""Ah yes, but no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.""    Obviously a ""Scotsman"" is a person native to Scotland, whether or not he sugars his porridge is irrelevant. There are many different flavors of Christianity, but all of them believe Jesus Christ died on the cross to absolve the sins of man. This is the base tenet of the religion and anyone who believes such is a christian, regardless of whether they sugar their porridge, believe in evolution, or want to literally murder atheists. To say otherwise is to invoke the No True Scotsman fallacy.  If, however, someone says, ""I'm a Scotsman, but I was born and raised in France,"" saying they are not a Scotsman is simply correct, not fallacious.  Does this make more sense?"
killthosewhodisagree,33mf4y,BaneOfSorrows,1 point,Tue May 26 17:13:52 2015 UTC,"But Scotsman is an objective definition. Unless you were born on a fuzzy border, there's no ambiguity or controversy with the definition of Scotsman.   The same can't be said for Christian. Some say only Catholics are Christian, some say Catholics aren't Christian. Some say it depends on the intellectual tenets held in someone's head, some say it's how someone lives their life. Until someone can draft a definition of Christian we can all agree on, No true scotsman can't apply. Some would say willing people to die means you aren't a Christian because they define a Christian as one who lives by Christ's commandments, so in this view a Christian is something you gradually become rather than are. When you claim no true scotsman, you're presupposing your definition of Christian as one who believes in the the resurrection and so forth. But my point is that you can't assert that definition because it's not even close to universally agreed upon."
killthosewhodisagree,33mf4y,Raptor-Llama,1 point,Sat May 30 17:52:43 2015 UTC,"But we can come pretty darn close to a definition by taking all those people who claim they are Christians and boiling them down to their least common denominator. What do all those factions have in common as their most basic precept? I would argue it's believing in the resurrection.  Of course, defining it in more complex ways makes it easier for Christians to detach themselves from others who share some of their beliefs and do things they don't approve of."
killthosewhodisagree,33mf4y,BaneOfSorrows,1 point,Sat May 30 18:18:18 2015 UTC,"Spong doesn't believe in the resurrection  (or God, for that matter), yet he calls himself a Christian, and indeed he's a retired bishop who hasn't been disposed. Then there's others like him who identify as Christians because of cultural upbringing and so forth.   Basically every christian group besides the mormons don't consider the mormons christian, and they believe in the resurrection, yet their understanding of the resurrection is radically different next to every other group. But the understanding of the resurrection varies also among the more mainline christian self identifying groups.  For evangelical protestants, someone being a Christian implies their salvation, so that's why they are particularly concerned with the definition, and they would probably deny the people in the post as being christian. Originally Christian is a term the Romans used for the people doing a bunch of things, so it was rather defined by what someone did rather than what intellectual precepts they held. But regardless, I don't think calling all who ""believe in the resurrection"" (of whom? Jesus the God-man, or Jesus the spirit child of elohim, or the metaphorical resurrection in the hearts of the disciples, or something else...) is a very useful definition, as the range it includes is too broad to be of much use, and there's very little that it tells about anyone holding such beliefs. We could narrow it to the Nicene creed, but even then we have radically different understandings of what certain words mean (particularly one, holy, catholic, and apostolic). I think it's more useful to just break it into each confession and deal with them on that basis.  But any term that deals with belief is nebulous. That's why scotsman is such a poor analogy most of the time. No one debates what a scotsman is. It has a clear and objective definition. This essentially doesn't exist in the realm of personal belief. Atheism is close, as lacking belief in God, but even then, you have to define God, and you'll get 1000 different answers.  It's as if the definition of Scotland was debatable, and it wasn't agreed where Scotland ended and where England began. Then, for people born on the controversial border, we wouldn't be able to say who was and who wasn't a true scotsman."

What it's really asking is if you see the ends justifying the means, or if the outcome isn't worth sacrificing one guy. (Here, deontology vs consequentialism.) You can find real world problems that are analogous to this a lot.   Perhaps a more practical version of this is: You have a vaccine that will save one really fat guy, or three thin people; who do you save? or: You're a doctor. A pregnant mother desperately needs an organ transplant, and a homeless man who is compatible just came in. Do you kill the homeless man to save the woman and her baby?

killthosewhodisagree,317h1l,FeatherMaster,7,Thu Apr 2 19:55:54 2015 UTC,"""In the heart of every rebel, there lives an aristocrat.""   Violent revolutions replace a government and set up their own leaders in the positions of power, and those new leaders proceed to commit atrocities on par or worse than whatever the old regime was doing. The Russian revolution, the cultural revolution in China, The Khmer Rouge, the commoners of the French Revolution and The Terror that followed, the war of 1812 and the slaughter of the Native population of North America following the revolution, more South American and African rebellions than I can count, the Iranian revolution, the Yugoslav wars, the various dictators of central and eastern Europe following the collapse of the USSR, and many, many more. Most if not all of these were aimed at overthrowing corrupt or tyrannical governments, and every single one ended in barbarity and oppression similar or worse than that of the overthrown regime. Out of all of these America got lucky, largely thanks to our oppressor being an ocean away and fighting two other wars while the rebellion was going on. It's worth noting that this was a unique circumstance. No other modern nation has had the benefit of a massive, uncolonized expanse of wilderness to focus their energy on after their revolution.   The most common outcome of any armed revolution is a dictator, not freedom. They don't work, they've never worked, and it's a short-sighted, simplistic way of thinking about regime change. That's the tyranny of the mob.  EDIT: Let's not forget that time a fanatical minority lost an election and seized control of Germany."

They included a right to militias, because they believed in a limited central government and left the military power to state militias.  We didn't actually adopt a central Federal military until after the Civil war.  One could argue in this point, the 2nd amendment has obsoleted itself, militias are no longer necessary nor useful in global conflicts.    Nowhere does it say ""you have the right to violently overthrow the government.""  That's completely ridiculous, in a democracy you don't get to kill the president and declare yourself the new ruler.  That's how fascist dictators work."

killthosewhodisagree,30qz8w,acreamscone,4,Wed Apr 8 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"For starters, that's just not accurate. At basically any physical task, a healthy person will obviously be superior. No fucking brainer. But fat doesn't magically make your retarded or something. So ""not one valuable thing a fat person can do that a thin/fit person can't do infinitely better"" is far from the truth, because there are many things that the two groups can do equally. My fat O Chem professor can probably do chemistry better than you can, and would be no worse at it than a skinnier person with equal experience.  Being fat isn't healthy or attractive, really. Having a bunch of fat people around is bad for society as a whole. So I wouldn't pretend that being fat is a good thing.  But there are a lot of good people who have some extra weight. My dad could take a bit better care of himself for example but he's quite possibly the best man I've ever known. He's highly intelligent, keeps up with modern times, productive, and has done more good for more people than you or I are ever likely to do.  For that reason (namely, that there are fat people out there who do not deserve to be scorned or hated) it is wrong to have a hatred for fat people as a whole.  Furthermore, you seem to be missing yet another variable in the equation: the nature of being a fatass. Unhealthy eating habits are just like addictions to alcohol or drugs. Can you think of an addict who was shamed into sobriety? No? Oh, right, addicts' lives and health are improved using positive encouragement and understanding, and through helping them develop better habits."

Besides, a bicycle doesn't keep kids from interacting with the people around them. No one has ever stared at a bicycle through dinner and ignored their friends, bicycles and cellphones aren't great comparisons. They can call their friend's on their parent's phone, and you should probably know where your 9 year old is, and they shouldn't be anywhere without an adult who has a phone. I'm not saying it's wrong to let your kid have a phone when they're 9, I'm just saying there are plenty of reasons that a young kid doesn't need a phone.

You shouldn't come to Canada from the US without reading up on how Canada citizens mostly act. Like if a guy is having trouble with bus fare, you're sorta expected to say ""Eh, sorry but I see that you have some troubles with the fare today, you need a helping hand, eh?""

There are laws that specifically make it so Women and other minorities can much more easily get jobs Restrictions on Birth Control are more religious then anti women. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwogDPh-Sow) It is also illegal to discriminate wages based on race or sex Maternity Leave is unavailable completely for the father's even though all they did was not physically have the child. Female Infanticide is a problem that does not correlate with our first world society. Many rape and assault statistics end up being misleading and biased It is hard to argue with so little time to care but i can say, we live in a state of EQUITY, not equality. Women and Men both have problems placed against them. Men have the Draft, Males are heavily ignored when it comes to rape  Men are way more likely to kill themselves Men are more likely to be victims of assault(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide) I could waste much more time debunking this. Our society may not be full equality, but it certainly is in a big state of equity. Each gender has their own problems but ignoring one side's roblems instead of another only leads to ignorance."

One being about how farm animals are treated versus a naturally grazing animal... Farm animals are kept in small cages their entire life, forced to reproduce against their will, have to stand in their own shit all day and are obviously stressed out by farm life. Depending on where you go, the butchering process can be painful and slow, just YouTube it. A wild animal usually lives in the environment that nature intended it to, it's not confined to a cage, it has the opportunity to do as it pleases, and if a hunter knows what he's doing, is usually killed very quickly with a single bullet or arrow."

Sweat dripped from his forehead and onto his keyboard.  He heard a knock at his door. Peeking outside he saw them.  The men in periwinkle blue.  He heard a crash, his door flew off the hinges. Two men grabbed him by his shoulders and hulled him to his front lawn. The third walked relaxed, pulling the safety off of his gun.  ""NO NO NO NO! THIS IS A BIG MISTAKE! MAYBE THERE WAS VOTE-FUZZING! BESTOF PROBABLY BRIGADED ME!"" Peter yelled for all he was worth.  The two men dropped him, Peter landed with a harsh thud. He began sobbing.

It gave those characters something they didn't have in the first game -- their own stories. Anju for example, got an entire 3-day storyline, where in OoT she's just a lady who is allergic to chickens. It's really awesome to see the characters come to life.   As far as lore goes, Zelda games are never super good about lore. They tend to focus almost exclusively on things that are happening right that moment. Like, they touched on the great war in OoT for 30 seconds and then never again. You hear about the goddesses a couple times, which is cool, but that's about as deep as it goes."

Greatswords win when fencing katanas, because they are designed to be able to fence.  They can parry, they have a crossguard, the edge won't snap if the blades go edge on and so on.  Katanas don't do that, the whole fighting style behind them is much more 'finessed'  As for this fat guy?  If he came at me with that katana I'd be worried, that thing looks sharp, but I have the sneaking suspicion if I got inside his guard then he'd be pretty fucked.  I'm no swordsman, my fighting strength lies in punching someone's face.  I doubt he is a swordsman either and I doubt he can throw a proper elbow, so I'm presuming I win on skill.  But yeah, I'd still prefer a gun.  I'm not in a hurry to punch a guy with a sword."

And if you try to just ignore him in hopes that he'll shut up he'll just repeat the question indefinitely, forever.  The most annoying part is that you can't even shut him up by putting on Netflix or something, because no matter how simple the plot of a film is he will just ask you every second, 'Why did that lion catch that mouse?' 'Why did Simba pounce on Nala?' 'Where are they going?' 'Why does Scar not like them?' 'Why are there hyenas attacking them?' 'Why are they eating bugs?'   Oh my god! Will you just watch the film! It's not that complicated!  I haven't yet found a film or TV show simplistic enough that he doesn't have to ask a question literally every time anyone says or does anything. AND HE'S 12!!

killthosewhodisagree,2phyuj,poster-childofsatan,11,Tue Dec 16 19:42:22 2014 UTC,The saddest part is is I actually know somebody like this. I dated him briefly in high school and he was always into his band and the newest metal band. Honestly I don't think he ever wore anything except for band shirts of bands that I had trouble reading the names of.  Anyways his little brother started high school and he took the chance to try and help him socially in high school. He had a bunch of other friends who were metal heads and introduced his brother in the group. Well one day (ex bf who shall be nameless) invited his friends and myself to a party he was having since his parents were gone for a second honeymoon. We were all just chillin and listening to music when his brother joined the group. We were all pretty nice to him and he seemed to be fitting right in. At one point somebody asks the brother what his favorite band is. The dude took a second and answered something like of mice and men or some other band that isn't metal enough for your average metal head.  It was like the tables flipped and somebody pulled the trigger. They all started tormenting him and picking on him. I got really uncomfortable and asked if he wanted to go with me to get pizza. He didn't want to and resorted to going back to his room to play Xbox. I returned a few minutes later and everybody was back to normal so I though nothing of it.  It turns out that when I left they had duct taped and tied his brother up and stuck him the closet of his room. When he found his way out three days later he called the police and all hell broke loose.  I didn't know about this until I broke up with him a few weeks later. I read about it in the newspaper and literally felt so sick. My ex bf was never charged and all of his friends still hang out at his house as well. It took me a long time for forgive myself.  EDIT: sorry my grammar and all around structure of this store is horrible. I'm on mobile and just wanted to say something on this matter. It's been a giant knife in my back for a long time now.

killthosewhodisagree,2oegrj,classlessjerk,2,Sat Dec 6 04:26:31 2014 UTC,"It's not about one demographic owning a show, it's about a bunch of 20-30+ year old guys watching a show designed for little to pre-teen girls, and then trying to make it their own in various ways.  Again though, it is a progressive-thinking show in that it has real character development for girls/women in the show, and was actually created and developed by a woman, and designed for girls without being stereotypically ""girly"".    While anyone can watch and appreciate a show, overshadowing the main demographic by being near-creepily obsessed with it is a problem.  There's already few enough shows for girls/women that aren't unbelievably generic, terribly written attempts at selling things or based almost entirely on romantic relationships.  It is one thing to just watch the show, it is another to be a part of a community of men who obsess over a show designed for little girls.  E: You have to put it into perspective a bit.  Almost every show on TV is made to target white males between 18-35.  The ones that are not are usually shows like Cougar Town and Sex & The City and others very much like it that target white females between 18-35.  You then have shows for younger audiences which also target mostly white boys (although the ""white"" part is definitely changing in all of these) like ... pretty much everything on Nick that is animated.  CN typically has more neutral shows like Regular Show, Adventure Time, and Uncle Grandpa, but you could certainly make the argument that Regular Show is targeted much more at boys.  Then you have shows targeted specifically at girls, and you find essentially nothing but garbage on Discovery Family (previously Hub) except for MLP:FIM, and possibly the new Strawberry Shortcake.  Little girls have TERRIBLE representation on mainstream TV.  Legend of Korra was one of the few action-oriented, non-stereotypical portrayal of a non-adult woman, and it got moved to Nicktoons and half its budget cut in the fourth season, and almost nobody even has Nicktoons."

They were considered immature and obnoxious and were considered immoral because they ""were into beastiality"". Same things can be said for the brony fandom.

It's not that religion creates the oppression, violence, and destruction, rather that it is used as a justification after the fact.   Religion doesn't ""create the oppression violence and destruction"", no, but it sure does give people very, very shitty ideas towards those ends, which, depending on their upbringing, geography and temper, and other circumstances, can often come to fruition.  Of course the person is to blame for their actions, but religion is also a predator on the type of desperate people who do shitty things.  Also, do not misconstrue this as a defense of an idiot YouTube commenter who thinks religious people should be murdered.  I do not endorse that kind of ridiculous hyperbole, however to say religion has absolutely no hand in insipring atrocities, is way, way off-base IMO.   You can be a violent, evil bigot with or without religion,   Certainly you can, however religion is a great organizing tool and rallying point for violent, evil bigots.  I liken it to the Mafia.  Without the Mafia, sure, there would still be murder and extortion.  But it's still an efficient organizational hub for murderers and extortionists, and the organization itself bears plenty of the blame for the crimes as well as the individuals doing them."

It is important that the fire be fairly large and of sufficient intensity to ensure complete burning of the flag. 3. Place the flag on the fire. 4. The individual(s) can come to attention, salute the flag, recite the Pledge of Allegiance and have a brief period of silent reflection. 5. After the flag is completely consumed, the fire should then be safely extinguished and the ashes buried. 6. Please make sure you are conforming to local/state fire codes or ordinances.

The ultimate point of the comic is that ""nice guys"" in question might be terrible people who think too highly of themselves, and they might be more successful with women if they actually respected them.  It's actually a fairly clever, if heavy handed, joke based on the ""neck beard"" stereotype.

There's also lots of things people call mosh pits. A push pit is about as distant from a hardcore pit as humanly possible. And things like circle pits and walls of death are also their own thing.   Realistically, most anyone could participate in a push pit - it's Slipknot, Korn, Disturbed and that kind of pop metal/nu metal.   I've seen dickhead non-metal people jump into pits in rock/metal clubs knowing fuck all about how to do them, and they just plain hit people and ruin it for everyone. They actually think the aim is to go in and hurt people.   Luckily, you don't get this at gigs.   Best pits I've ever seen was during Parkway Drive's most famous song 'Carrion'. Everyone flips their shit and goes completely mental when they play it, venues usually ask PWD not to play it because of how completely crazy everyone goes."

Zoe Quinn's whole thing was proven to be false, her shitty ex-boyfriend was a creep who wanted to destroy her reputation, and then she continued to get doxxed and harassed.  Now radical feminists, the not at all actual feminists and just kind of insane ones, are having a giant piss battle with MRAs and it's just a mess and the original message of what the whole thing could have been about has been lost.  Essentially, guys got mad because hurr durr woman slept with people to get publicity that never happened.  THEN got mad because the publicity from her getting doxxed may have been the reason her game got greenlighted.  And then SJW radfems latched on.  And then more shitstorms.

They're also pissed about all the articles lately that portray gamers as angry white neckbearded misogynists. The fact is, people on both sides have been threatened and harassed. You can't judge either side based on a few psychos and trolls."

They're just reviews.  I can understand why articles that portray gamers as neckbeard misogynists would piss them off, but obviously a small yet non-negligible part of the gaming community does consist of neckbeard misogynists. If, like the majority of gamers, you're not one of these assholes, why not just ignore these articles and move on? They'll go away eventually as gaming becomes progressively more popular. Is gaming really such an integral part of their identity that they take these articles personally? It's not a damn religion.

For example, some guy got fired from GameSpot for writing a bad review about one of their advertisers' games and everyone shat a brick. The Zoe thing was just a springboard for discussing the issue, and the Streisand Effect kicked in when people felt like the discussion was being suppressed.  These aren't just random bloggers saying gamers are scum, it's the actual gaming press. Gamergate supporters see this as an example of the journalistic issues that they've been talking about. Basically, a biased, ideologically motivated gaming press that doesn't represent gamers and seems to openly despise them. Imagine the shitstorm that would ensue if 11 major golfing magazines came out with articles on the same day saying golfers were fat old racists.

I remember refreshing /b/ all afternoon with the hope that someone would make a new meme. I was a memer back when Advice Dog was the only one and I still upvote every Advice Dog meme I see becasue of the fond rush of nostalgia it brings me. Nowadays, there are many thousand on quickmeme and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny. Do you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don’t remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them. In fact, you have only submitted two posts to adviceanimals garnering a total of just 4 points and have not commented there any time recently. So please, respect my judgement regarding the direction of the subreddit and the integrity of posts I have held dear to my heart for nearly 7 years but you have no strong feelings for."

It added some realism but it was NSFW.  It was called Sanguine's Debauchery and before the SFW alternative death mods came out it was the best one to have.

They had to introduce and develop the MUTOs and establish their power and the threat they pose to Godzilla and humanity. Not just that, but this is a reboot, meaning this is a creature we haven't seen before, more so since this is basically introducing the character to most western audiences. All while keeping proper pacing in the movie so the end fight (especially the female's fatality) are even more exciting. Also, the only reason you're disappointed Joe died is because he was Bryan Cranston. If it were anyone else, you'd notice that he couldn't have stayed around for the rest of the movie without being out of place.

No one's arguing that, you little bitch.    As someone who has over 300 confirmed kills, I am telling you, specifically, in the military, no one calls SEALs SF. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""Special Operations"" you're referring to the United States Special Operations Command, which includes things from Army Rangers to my secret network of spies across the USA.   So your reasoning for calling a SEAL SF is because random people ""call the gorilla ones SF?"" Let's get SOW and MRR in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone DEVGRU or SEAL Team Six? It's not one or the other, that's not how Special Operations Command works. They're both. A SEAL is a SEAL and a member of USSOCOM. But that's not what you said. You said a SEAL is SF, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all operators of the USSOCOM family SF, which means you'd call Rangers, Pararescuemen, and other operators SF, too.

killthosewhodisagree,2e5fae,Gruzman,6,Thu Aug 21 11:48:16 2014 UTC,"Depends on what they buy and where they buy it, and even how they buy it. The political implications of consuming video games themselves are that you think that video games shouldn't be banned. And buying a videogame as opposed to pirating it when pirating is easier says something about your values."
killthosewhodisagree,2e5fae,powhawkins,2,Thu Aug 21 12:06:31 2014 UTC,"Pirating is not easier, unless it is a Ubisoft game."

killthosewhodisagree,2e5fae,Rockworm503,-2,Fri Aug 22 05:28:15 2014 UTC,"Wanting to ignore the political implications of decisions doesn't make those implications go away.   Ignoring the 'implications' of something makes those implications meaningless, to you. So I'd assume that it's a two sided coin: if everyone selectively ignored the implications of buying video games, you'd effectively be depoliticizing the action. Or if everyone placed an excess of thought into what games they bought and began to fight with other people about what they bought, they'd be deeply politicizing it.   Just outright saying ""everything you do is political, you can't ignore it, so you shouldn't ignore it."" is a leap in some ways."

They often target women and the music they like, or the way they dress.  So contributing to this I feel, is the way this film treats the main female lead. Frank's motivation to go on a killing spree is that he has cancer. Roxy's motivation is that she hates normal girls. Near the end of the film, Frank leaves her because she lied about having shitty parents, but she returns to join him in killing people at the film's version of America's Got Talent. It seems pretty gross that she, as a character, has her entire shtick be 'one of the few good girls', who returns to die alongside Frank.   Also note that she dresses in a very outdated way, mainly wearing long dresses, almost a 1950s aesthetic. I feel like she's designed to appeal to 'nice guy' defeners who are 'sick of sluts'. She's presented as opposite to the spoilt 'average' girl."

What ""nice guy"" isn't gonna lap that shit up?) Then we have the ""special snowflake"" teenage girl who hates everyone and has this ridiculous superiority complex, except here it's exaggerated to the point where she literally wants to murder ""normal"" girls.

Him buying the flowers was a little creepy and his dialogue was at times cringey.    The girls old school look was made for neckbeards.  Is probably overanalyzing it and a little moronic.

killthosewhodisagree,24ky4d,autowikibot,1 point,Mon May 5 12:50:02 2014 UTC,"Apostrophe:       The apostrophe (’, although often rendered as '), is a punctuation mark, and sometimes a diacritical mark, in languages that use the Latin alphabet or certain other alphabets. In English, it serves three purposes:    The marking of the omission of one or more letters (as in the contraction of do not to don’t). The marking of possessive case (as in the eagle's feathers, or in one month's time). The marking by some as plural of written items that are not words established in English orthography (as in P's and Q's). (This is considered incorrect by others; see Use in forming certain plurals. The use of the apostrophe to form plurals of proper words, as in apple’s, banana’s, etc., is universally considered incorrect.)   According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), ‘apostrophe’ comes ultimately from Greek ἡ ἀπόστροφος [προσῳδία] (hē apóstrophos [prosōidía], “[the accent of] ‘turning away’, or elision”), through Latin and French.   The apostrophe looks the same as a closing single quotation mark, although they have different meanings. The apostrophe also looks similar to, but is not the same as the prime symbol ( ′ ), which is used to indicate measurement in feet or arcminutes, as well as for various mathematical purposes, and the ʻokina ( ʻ ), which represents a glottal stop in Polynesian languages. Such incorrect substitutes as ´ (acute) and ` (grave) are not uncommon in unprofessional texts, where an ambiguous treatment of the apostrophe in digital typesetting (as explained below) is a major factor of this confusion.

I think it's more because he was seen by the Romans as a troublemaker rather than simply because of his beliefs.  In actual fact Jesus did many things to stir up trouble for the Romans, including. One such act is listed in the bible, and I will post what it says here:   Jesus did go unto the forums where he saw a young male playing music upon his lyre. Jesus went to the man  who played upon his instrument, and jesus did declare ""your music is shit justinius bieberus, you and your fans   must incur the wroth of god and be smitten from this good earth""   the roman men took great offense to the statement, and took it unto themselves to destroy this defener, and   attempted to perma-ban jesus. Upon this act, the lord god (head admin) allowed 3 days to pass, before   allowing jesus back onto the earth.   from the verses of (LE)viticus 4.20  so from this we can see that it was jesus who was the real murderous defener"

The car has a hand-finished fibreglass body shell atop its bonded extruded aluminium chassis that provides a rigid platform for the suspension, while keeping weight and production costs to a minimum. The roadster is capable of speeds up to 240 km/h (150 mph).  The Elise was named after Elisa, the granddaughter of Romano Artioli who was chairman of Lotus and Bugatti at the time of the car's launch.

It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”  The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!  The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.  The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.  Semper Fi.  p.s. close the borders"

It’s 4.6 billion years old. Last night I was doing weed since it is so healthy and stuff and cures cancer, and while I was high, I realized that God didn't exist and the Bible was a lie"" The professor was visibly shaken and dropped his copy of the King James Bible. He stormed out of the room sobbing uncontrollably, partly because of him being proven wrong, partly because a priest molested him as a kid and those memories were resurfacing, and partly because the atheist was so damn awesome looking in his fedora that he might now be gay. The students applauded and all registered democrat that day and renounced all phony religions. A cat named “Mao Tse-tsung” ran into the room and sat on a copy of Darwin’s Origin of The Species and shed a tear.
