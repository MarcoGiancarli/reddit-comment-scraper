sandiego,3e2mlo,SwillFish,16,Tue Jul 21 14:07:14 2015 UTC,"The determining factor whether you get solar or not should be payback time. My buddy has a koi pond which requires an electric pump. His electric bill was $450 per month. The system he installed cost him 34K but the return on his investment was less than seven years.   My bill is only $60 or so a month. The payback on mine was 20+ years, so I passed on a system. I think if you can get down to < 10 years, it's a worthwhile investment. Prices on systems are dropping (I think about 8% per year) but so are incentives and tax credits. You will need to educate yourself.   Also, make sure you own your system instead of leasing it. There are some really generous tax credits and a lot of solar companies own the systems, which you pay off over time, but keep the tax credits for themselves which they sell to third party investors.  Lastly, net metering will likely end (where you get a credit from SDG&E for excess electricity you generate). Solar companies are using this as a ""use it or lose it"" hard sell right now. I think in the short term this will be a problem, but over the long run, you will be able to store your own power which will make net metering irrelevant. http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/01/403529202/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-unveils-home-battery-is-3-000-cheap-enough"

sandiego,3e2mlo,redldr1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:10 2015 UTC,Co-generation is actually very hard on the grid. When you put power back into the system it actually hurts the system as a whole. The transformers that step down power do not efficiently step it back up.

sandiego,3e2mlo,buttrapinpirate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:03 2015 UTC,"They don't cut power as in reduce your usage while using them. Just plug all of your stuff into strips and flick the switch on the strip when they're not in use. Things like TV's, phone chargers, receivers, etc use power even while off. A few watts X a ton of things X 20+ hours a day not in use can add up to a lot every month. Sometimes about 10 to 15 percent of my bill I've found."

sandiego,3e2mlo,sdguero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:51 2015 UTC,"Best reply on here.   Only thing I'd add is to consider a smaller system if you are regualarly in Tier 3/4 pricing every month. The ROI is much better on a system that is taking away your $0.41/kWh tier 4 electricity usage vs your $0.15/kWh tier 1 power usage. A coworker of mine that lives in east county has monthly bills as high as $600 (two houses on the property). We figured out that if he got a smaller less expensive  system using microinverters, his ROI got much better (as low as 4 years) as it would only take away his most expensive power. And you can always upgrade later if you need/want too,    Also, if you have an electric car you qualify for a different pricing scheme from SDGE that includes less expensive power at off hours (i.e. at night when you'd be using the grid vs your solar panels).   Consumers with high power bills are probably best off by purchasing a smaller solar system (like 5KW) and perhaps looking at buying/leasing an electric car like the Nissan Leaf. If you power bill is less than $100/month it still doesn't make sense to get solar.  In our house (1900 sq ft, with a hot tub but no central AC) we have been averaging almost $200/month in hot months from using a window AC unit to cool about half the house. Last winter we were down around $80/month when we weren't running the AC.   I'm gonna be looking hard at a semi-DIY solar system when we get a new roof next year. Solar systems are not nearly as complicated as the people selling them pretend they are. If you source your own panels/brackets/invertor and contract out the install you can save a lot of money. Any decent roofer can install the panels/brackets, and a licenced electrician should be able to install the wriing and invertor(s) to get a grid tie system running. From what I've seen the solar installers (especially SolarCity) really jack up the prices."

Solar City will give you a Power Purchase Agreement (or any of these solar companies really) that will give you a fixed price on electricity over the next 20 years. It will always be a discount to SDGE.

The panels are guaranteed to work and produce the KWHs on my contract for 30 years and they also insure the roof for their work for 10 years for 2mil.

sandiego,3e2mlo,SanDiegoDude,2,Tue Jul 21 19:31:12 2015 UTC,"I have solar panels, purchased with my new house build in Murrieta. It's a 2900 square foot house, and in the middle of summer in the Murrieta heat (high 90's usually), with the AC set squarely at 72 degrees, 6 computers in my office and a car plugged in in the garage every night, my past 2 electricity bills have been about 60 bucks apiece. From January up through June, my bills were near zero (still get to pay taxes and state fees). My annual charge so far is up to 140 dollars. Granted I sprung for a 5 kw system, which was around 28 grand if memory serves, but considering the savings I'm getting, I'm expecting the system to pay for itself within 5 years.  One thing I will mention though is you are a slave to sunlight. If you live near the beach or in the La Jolla Cove where it's constantly marine layer/overcast, the actual amount of sunlight you soak up is going to be greatly reduced. Same thing goes if you live near a hill that would block sunlight to your property for even part of the day. Make sure you take those conditions into account!  edit - forgot to mention, the tax rebate is fantastic for buying solar, and make sure you take that into account for the cost of going solar. (and also remember if you lease, the solar company most likely gets that rebate, not you!)"

sandiego,3e2mlo,encinitaschaco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:37:21 2015 UTC,"We had ours installed 18 months ago -- very happy with the results.  We bought ours, for 2 reasons. First, we wanted the 33% tax credit. If you lease, the leasing company gets the credit. Second, we didn't want a hassle if we ever sold our house. It's not that you can't sell your house if you do have a lease, but it adds extra paperwork and negotiations. One of our neighbors just sold his house with owned panels, and he said that was an important factor in the sale.  We aimed at replacing 90% of our current bill. In fact, we're running at around 98%. However, summers are getting hotter and hotter, which means we're running the A/C more, so I expect that in a couple of years, we'll be down to 95% or even 90%.   One of the things I did last winter was have an electrician put in dedicated 40W circuits upstairs and downstairs to run space heaters. Our gas bill in the winter used to run $50 or $60 a month. With the space heaters, we got it down to $10 to $15. You need the dedicated circuits so that you don't blow your fuses every time you turn on a hair dryer.  You don't really want to have an excess of power, because SDG&E will only buy it back from you for about 25 cents on the dollar -- not a good return.  I calculated that our payback on the panels, which ran us $12K net (after the 7K tax credit), have a payback of 7.1 years, assuming current usage as well as very modest rate increases from SDG&E. In reality, I think the weather will continue to get hotter, and rates will go up quite a bit.  SDG&E faces a tough problem. As more and more of us convert to solar, they have to recoup the costs. They can't really squeeze any more out of their lowest tier customers, so they push up rates on big ones -- corporations, schools, etc. But this incentivizes them to go out and get panels as well.   Their response has been to try to figure out a way to charge more and more for their infrastructure, which will in essence penalize people for using solar. However, the more they do this, the more it drives people to get off the grid entirely. Right now, it doesn't make sense to the average homeowner. But if SDG&E starts charging $100 per month for using their grid, people will start using battery storage.  If SDG&E was smart they would embrace this shift, and enable the transformation of the grid. But I doubt they'll do that."
sandiego,3e2mlo,PThompson509,0,Tue Jul 21 19:54:59 2015 UTC,"Figure out what your monthly average power use is (SDGE should be able to do this for you), and then plan on getting at least 125% of that from your panels.  You will keep finding new uses for ""free"" electricity.  :)  Also make sure your inverter can handle another bank of panels for that time when you need more (yes, this will happen)."
sandiego,3e2mlo,rogdor2,7,Tue Jul 21 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"That's not great advice, honestly. The cost of a system scales pretty linearly with size, but the electrical savings taper off the closer you get to 100% of your usage. The best returns usually come from an 80-90% offset, and most installers will shoot for that range. Also that gives you room to take on other energy efficiency projects, which usually are a much better investment than solar panels."

A proper analysis would be nice.  So...  1 - Of the $60.7M the CEO was paid, $58M was stock compensation. This stock comp cost the company itself roughly $0. This is money that is functionally taken from investors, not from the cash operations of the business. So, if the business is losing cash in a serious way, reducing this number to $0 wouldn't save a single employee (might even cost a few since there is an accounting position or 2 managing this process). It would help stock price though, so those investors would be a lot happier. Beyond that, this is a pretend number. Until they vest and are exercise-able by the employee it is just an estimate of what they think they are worth. In 2014 of the $58M, $2M actually became cash in his pocket. The rest remains fake.  2 - Does San Diego really want to say that immigrants ""took yer jobs?""  And what does that have to do with anything? Talk about an about face in the article. First it was hate the rich, now it's hate the foreigners? Even if it is true that there is some wage suppression for abusing this (which requires more proof than a couple angry engineers and a poorly sourced article), how do you argue it is bad for San Diego? Jobs build the economy, and even if they were replaced by U.S. workers it wouldn't have any net impact on the city. If people get laid off it doesn't matter much if they are foreign or US. They are still going to be looking for new jobs. They will start looking here and that act in and of itself will suppress wages heavily here locally for those positions.  If Qualcomm is truly playing with people's lives in such a poker playing matter, shame on them, but we need more proof."

sandiego,3dzb2t,rlilly,3,Mon Jul 20 23:49:45 2015 UTC,"Share Repurchase  The primary purpose of shares is not to hand out shares to executives. And $15B worth is a lot more than they will need to satisfy that. They intend to buy almost 15% of their own shares.   The most common reason I have seen is to prop up share value when they feel the company is undervalued. Sometimes it works as a dividend. The article doesn't say what Qualcomm's motivation was, but the article implies it was intended to be a dividend.  And again we have a false equivalence. A failing company with negative cash flow should not be doing a share buyback. That would be horribly irresponsible. But the idea that just because they have some extra cash laying around means they should never eliminate any jobs is unrelated.    But we are playing in speculation land based on this article. If they provide a solid reason (e.g. we are getting rid of x line of business, so we are letting related people go) it is a regular restructuring activity of a large company. There is nothing uncommon or weird about it. It sucks that people lose their jobs but just because people have one doesn't mean Qualcomm is required to keep it.   If on the other hand it is simply a chess play to stave off a proxy fight, they are playing a dangerous game with people's lives and horrid to treat people this way. But keep in mind that the article notes that investors have been pushing Qualcomm to eliminate lines of business. I don't know how many employees are in the chip making business, but it could be more than the 10% that are supposedly on the chopping block."

sandiego,3dzb2t,rlilly,2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:48 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying, but more acutely it could be said that it seems distasteful to have both of the following occur at the same time:  -A share buyback because they have a lot of excess cash and no better use of the money otherwise, and  -Layoff a significant chunk of employees because they are no longer needed (or potentially expendable for Wall street games - protecting unworthy executives at the cost of employees).   As a result it calls into question whether a highly compensated employee leading the business is adequately doing his job. Beyond that, as local San Diegans we suffer from a bias because it could take money from our community (assuming the cuts hit hardest here) only to redistribute it elsewhere, (Wall street, etc...).  All of these judgments are worthy. But burning through cash just to not lay people off can potentially make worse waves in the future without a proper plan. We need more information before we can cast aspersions as to the adequacy of managements performance."

Which means that if all of those shares were to vest and be exercised then the CEO would basically ""take"" less than .005% of the market value from other investors and keep it for himself.  And that process should have $0 impact on the overall market cap and remove $0 from the company. The CEO would make money, but it would have basically no impact on operations or future results of the company, other than the report of the stock comp expense in the P&L. If investors hate that dilution, they can vote down his compensation. Hard to see how that would save any jobs when it wouldn't amount to a rounding difference on investor value.   If 4,000 people were laid off and their average annual cost to the company is $100,000 each, you are looking at annualized savings of $400M in terms of annual cash flow, which is the life blood of the company. That is significantly different than stock options to the operations. If they are getting out of lines of business, or needing to trim certain areas which are no longer productive,.that is a painful reality. I have no idea how this relates to a proxy battle, but it would significantly improve cash flow in the short run while eliminating stock compensation entirely would have a negligible effect.   You can hate on the guy, but in the interim, even if the 4,000 employees are laid off, he is still the CEO of a $104B company that directly employs over 26,000 worldwide.

Sure, even an eight figure bonus won't dilute the share price much, but it's not free.  And this is one C-level employee receiving a single bonus.

Also, you don't find many full stack/generalist engineers there....lots of specialized embedded, proprietary firmware/hardware/radio.   Engineers in that world can be compensated real well but also find it hard to join another tech/culture at the drop of a hat.    Like in any suddenly saturate job market, the ones with good soft skills AND hard skills will be okay.   God help the rest."

My ticket didn't show up in the mail at all after receiving it. almost a year later, after trying multiple times to find it, I assumed it disappeared, and I got lucky. I asked a cop friend to look it up at the one year mark. He was unable to find it, and I assumed that was it. Then, in January, I had to go to the DMV to renew my license, and all of a sudden, it reappeared in the system, and I own over $800, when the original ticket was ~400. Can't afford to pay $800, would have been fine paying off the original ticket, though I would have tried to fight it first. Now, because I wasn't able to find a date, I can't fight it, and have to wait to pay until I can afford it.  Good luck with your ticket OP, sometimes the system is just fucked, but hopefully it get resolved for you much easier."

It confused me because you can't drive there, there is no street.  But oddly, Google Maps shows it as a short, dead-end road. Maybe it used to be a turnabout that parents could drive through to drop their kids off to school?  EDIT: Also what's interesting, and what I can tell from this map and not from the entire San Diego one, is that it counts alleyways as streets."
sandiego,3dykcm,untaken-username,3,Mon Jul 20 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, I'd say the dead end was probably a road or alley that went through the original parcel map. When the school was built it must have been partially retained for deliveries/services. It appears the city considers it as part of the road network so it might be under an easement agreement with the school.    EDIT: This parcel map shows the site of the school as separate lots so the school must have come later and combined lots."

sandiego,3e38vi,needmoretape,2,Tue Jul 21 18:42:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, welcome!!!  I'll give a list, whatever comes in mind!  -Balboa Park.  Scenic, beautiful gardens, architect, and historic location.  Try to go on a Tuesday, because they have some free musuem you can check out.  It MIGHT just be for locals (I'm not too sure, maybe SD locals or Cali residents), but worst case, you can check out the museums that aren't free and it will be less crowded. They also use to have a cell phone adventure which takes you all around the park, its a lot of fun and very informative as well! http://www.balboapark.org/bpoc/blog/get-ready-alternate-reality-adventure#.Va58I_lVhuA  -Torrey Pines Hike.  - One of the most beautiful hikes in SD in my opinion.  You can park on the street before for free, just have to walk up the hill. Or you can drive in and park within the park, its a little expensive but will save you time.  Only problem is, if you want the full experience, park at the bottom (right outside) hike up, then down to the beach, and have a stroll back to your car waiting for you at the base.  -Point Loma Lighthouse.  Its a beautiful point that over looks the SD bay and Coronado, and has a lot of historical pieces to look at. I think a car to get in is like $5 or something, and you can go down to the water on the otherside, and its beautiful. ** -Sunset cliffs.**  Just google it, its BEAUTIFUL  -Coronado Strip.  You can check out the Island west of downtown.  They can walk around the strip on Orange Ave and chek out some cool stores.  Or if you're feeling more adventurous, you can take a boat ferry from downtown across to Coronado.  It will take you to the north side, right to a little outdoor shoping plaza which is a lot of fun.  -Mount Soldad.  A scenic view of La Jolla on top of a hill.  Check this out when you go to La Jolla Cove, its really close by!!!  -If you're down for a little cute drive into the country side, check out Julian and snag some fresh Pie and Ice Cream!  Julian Pie is pretty famous, and getting it straight from the heart of Julian is amazing.  I think its like a 40min drive from you.  -We have some amazing hikes, some long, some short, some easy. ** Mt Woodson (or Potato Chip)** along with Iron Mountain are roughly 5-7miles round trip, and its a beautiful view.  Or you can check out Mission Trails, which have a dozen trails going all throughout the mountains.  Even easy ones like los penasquitos canyon trail is fun as well!    -Carlsbad Flower Field. I've never been here myself, but looks beautiful! http://theflowerfields.com/   -Birch Aquarium.  Not sure the cost, but real cute in La Jolla!  Just a few things that came to mind!

sandiego,3dwyuh,beaniepoodle,5,Mon Jul 20 17:41:42 2015 UTC,No- I've already pushed it with the landlord by having my own two large dogs here.  There's no way I can keep him.

sandiego,3dwyuh,beaniepoodle,2,Mon Jul 20 23:53:44 2015 UTC,Really shouldn't do this unless it's actually necessary to have a support dog. I'm a social worker and many of my clients really need this help. Suggesting people take advantage of the system so they can have dogs in otherwise non dog friendly apartments is shitty and a large reason why many people consider emotional support animals a joke
sandiego,3dwyuh,hugitoutguys,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:32:21 2015 UTC,"I agree that it can be shitty to have a dog in a dog-unfriendly apartment, but if he could at least keep him to buy some time, that might've been worth it. As OP already explained, that's not an option anyway.  And emotional support animals will continue to be treated as a joke until the requirements for designating an animal as an ESA are changed and made more stringent. I actually got bitten by an ESA tonight at school! Drew blood and everything."
sandiego,3dwyuh,wubbleschnaft,2,Tue Jul 21 05:15:00 2015 UTC,Right. It sounds like you are complaining that someone had an aggressive dog that is ESA certified when it shouldn't be. Which was what you're suggesting to OP-that a dog with previous aggression be ESA certified. By taking advantage of the requirements and lying to get certificates you are worsening the situation. It's never ok for any reason and shouldn't be a go to suggestion.
sandiego,3dwyuh,ImInLoveWithMyBike,9,Tue Jul 21 09:28:35 2015 UTC,"Try asking rescues to courtesy post him for you. Often times, they don't have open fosters but a courtesy post should be easy to do if you can keep the dog safe. If they are active on Facebook, they could network him through there hopefully. You could even ask if they have any trainers who volunteer with them who could work with the dog on his dog issues or if he'd be allowed to go to an adoption event every once in a while to get exposure.   When I was trying to rehome a stray who couldn't stay in my house, I found a boarding kennel that offered a discounted rescue rate for long term boarders. I was able to keep him safe in the kennel while he found a home. A rescue courtesy posted him for me and let him come to events where he eventually met his amazing new people."

One had mange when she brought it home from the shelter, and she ""couldn't afford the vet bills"" so she returned it to the shelter and replaced it with another puppy off Craiglist.  I don't know how she does it- it's horrible.  She knows he has nowhere to go and she doesn't give a fuck.  She's a shit human being.  Edit to add that she left him behind when she moved a few days ago.  Took her two other dogs, left Rudy at my mom's house.  My mom can't keep him either and my sister knows this."

Seasons 52 - This won't be the cheapest, but you can find a good meal and a glass of wine (if that's your thing).  The staff is amazing, and they really add to the atmosphere.  This restaurant is a national chain.  Eureka! - This is bar food, but it's another option.  The service is good, but I feel it's a little pricey.  Draft Republic - This is another bar-type setting, but it has delicious food, a wide selection of drinks, and entertainment (pool, ping pong, shuffleboard).  Food is average in price, and it's definitely one of the nicer places.  Regent's Pizza - This place is always crowded because it's delicious.  There's Chicago and New York style pizzas.  I've heard from a Chicago native that this is the closest you can get to real Chicago pizza in San Diego, but I'm not an expert on that matter.  With the expansion of the mall, they're promising to open some more restaurants, so you'll see more options in the not-too-distant future.  Just keep your fingers crossed that they aren't all national chains."

Apparently, this staph bacteria is ever present, especially in areas like your Mission Bay beaches, said to be tested and very high in staph related bacteria. California's waste water treatment plants release storm water into overflows when there is too much run off and also release raw sewage as well. WTF?  Its also common to get it while hospitalized. Yay.  (more at the bottom of this post)  We get run off from a golf course/state park that raises E. coli levels in a local bay and there are 'advisories' issued but frankly, we surf there only during storms and with a 10 foot tide swing and 10' of swell, the water exchange is huge and bacteria simply cannot collect in high enough concentrations to make us sick.

sandiego,3dvg5w,zSprawl,2,Mon Jul 20 04:13:08 2015 UTC,wow - i saw SOOOOO many cars that day w/wipers on and no headlights.  ignorance of the law is no excuse I suppose!
sandiego,3dvg5w,og_sandiego,15,Mon Jul 20 20:32:28 2015 UTC,I can't go a day without seeing more then 10 people who don't use their turn signal even though it holds me up from turning waiting for them. Happens every single day. I don't get why they think a turn signal is optional? So many cops on the road and no one pulling them over.
sandiego,3dvg5w,betonthis1,12,Mon Jul 20 00:21:14 2015 UTC,If there is a car on either side of me I just have to automatically assume they are going to merge into me without a blinker. Today on the 15 almost no one had their lights on when it was raining the hardest. Socal driving is just something else I tell ya.
sandiego,3dvg5w,AlkarinValkari,2,Mon Jul 20 00:33:14 2015 UTC,"The thing is that if you had the chance to ask the person ""why didn't you have your lights on"", she'd respond ""it wasn't nighttime"", and then you'd be left just staring at her, knowing that she's too far gone, and that there's no way to help her by explaining lights were needed because of the rain."
sandiego,3dvg5w,treein303,11,Mon Jul 20 06:40:29 2015 UTC,"I see SO many folks who are above the use of turn signals. Turn signals are NOT for them. They are for the unwashed masses. Why just being in the presence of their awesome, giant, shiny black Escalade you should KNOW... it goes where it wants to. And low be to those who impede it.   And I have never seen anyone in this town get pulled over for not using a turn signal. It's on my bucket list though. Hope it happens before I die."
sandiego,3dvg5w,remedialrob,4,Mon Jul 20 01:31:06 2015 UTC,Exactly!!!

sandiego,3dvg5w,damnyou777,2,Mon Jul 20 07:03:06 2015 UTC,What gets me is the number of people I saw today driving modern cars with automatic headlights that were switched off.  Why would you do that? Just leave the damn switch on auto and you don't have to worry about me almost not seeing you when I'm trying to get on the freeway.  And why do all the people who do this drive silver/grey cars?
sandiego,3dvg5w,kliff0rd,0,Mon Jul 20 04:37:22 2015 UTC,It's those and I saw a couple with their headlights on but no taillights. So apparently they turned one on and not the other because they knew they needed headlights on.
sandiego,3dvg5w,treein303,2,Mon Jul 20 04:44:47 2015 UTC,Who wants to put in money for a billboard on the 15 that says nothing but:  Hi! Turn signals aren't optional. Thanks for reading.

sandiego,3dxej4,DronePuppet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:04:35 2015 UTC,My question: Do we lose most of this rain?  Is there some kind of collection process that happens from storm drain to ocean?
sandiego,3dxej4,PROMODZoCOM,2,Mon Jul 20 18:10:05 2015 UTC,"From what I've read about the drought, San Diego gets most of its water from the aquifer out of northern California, so rain in san diego doesn't really help except to water the plants here. I did see something about putting in legislation to allow water from the lakes around here to be used after a purification process, but that wasn't going to be in effect for another 4 or 5 years.   I was in borrego springs this weekend though and it seemed like I read something about them having a separate aquifer that they use. So the rain may have helped them a bit."
sandiego,3dxej4,DonkeyHoardersUnite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:26:55 2015 UTC,You'd think they could divert some of it to a processing plant between here and the ocean...
sandiego,3dxej4,PROMODZoCOM,2,Tue Jul 21 02:51:23 2015 UTC,"There are some collection processes, but not nearly enough to capture a significant amount from a downpour.  Prop 1 from 2014 was supposed to address this (among other things), but that's obviously not for a few years and doesn't help with this past weekend's rainfall."
