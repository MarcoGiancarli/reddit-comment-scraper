(I think the actual joke was that his presence was essentially an irrelevant sideline spectator that year on the Celtics. Also, fat.)"

ShaqHoldingThings,1u8dww,Gnaget,2,Fri Jan 3 07:39:21 2014 UTC,Why does Shaq feel like he needs to cradle everyone he meets?
ShaqHoldingThings,1u8dww,78_36,5,Fri Jan 3 02:33:47 2014 UTC,"He's the gentle giant. Shaq knows he has the power to crush your puny mortal body with one hand, but he shows his mercy by using gentle touch, cradling, and embraces to nurture his worshippers' souls."
