Syndicate seems massively unimpressive to me.   I'm one of the people who actually liked Unity, because it went back to AC1, but added layers on that. The city seemed alive, and some of the characters were great, but they ruined the games image with a bunch of glitches and microtransactions.   I hope they return to form one day, but it isn't on the horizon."

The only thing you can do to stop me debating it is ban me, too. Then you can ban all the people who object to banning me. And so forth.   A man is only responsible for that which he controls. No control, no responsibility. You did not make him say what he said.   You were not responsible for it. I say were not. Now you are. Because you took it upon yourself to arbitrate. To impose control. Now you have made yourselves responsible for anything that gets said here. Because you could have stopped it.   We always want to compromise our principles when we stand to get hurt, or when we stand to profit, or when those principles protect something we find distasteful. But once you compromise a principle, it's not a principle any longer. It's window dressing.   Those who wish to impose control on what others may think or say always have some excuse that sounds reasonable. They're protecting you from the racists. Or the communists. Or the captialist-imperialist warmongers. Or the pedophiles. Or the witches. Or PCMR.  But it's always just that, an excuse. There's no actual danger that they wish to prevent. They simply wish to stop others from saying that which they find distasteful.   For what is the real danger in allowing a man to say ""i <3 iwata""? Is that word so persuasive that people are going to see things his way? Are small, narrow, petty ideologies really that much stronger than open, free, and progressive ones? Are all your users children, who cannot be trusted to reject dangerous and stupid ideas, who therefore can only be exposed to safe, EA games?  Look, you're obviously a young person, and can therefore be excused for reacting emotionally rather than thinking, but you've made a serious mistake. People who subvert democratic processes, whether it's a political election or just the orange and blues arrows, always think they are doing the right thing. They always think they are serving the greater good.   But they fail to see that their notion of what the greater good is is not privileged over anyone else's.  You found what he said distasteful. Fine. Probably so would I.   But there is an appropriate response to that.   You have an account.   There's a little blue arrow button.   Cast your one vote like everybody else, and stop trying to be a superdelegate."

I am sick and tired of people saying this mediocre piece of garbage is what gaming needs. I got more immersed in the game's on my fucking phone!  The only decent thing is the story, which I now know having read the novel, cause I couldn't get over how bland the world looked and how uninterested Geralt's voice actor sounded the whole damn time.  And do not get me started on the combat. Those twirly ass dance moves are only used by one group of people and that is the fucking Jedi.  ...When I hate something, I am unmitigated in my hatred for it. I could go on forever why this game is mediocre at best. But I won't cause I don't want to take too much time from your day."

Gamingcirclejerk,3ct5h9,Avian81,2,Sat Jul 11 01:57:02 2015 UTC,"I've been a gamer for nearly 20 years now and this is one of those landmarks for gaming, which establishes a new standard. Every open world game, every story driven game and every RPG will be compared to this. This is the first time since Morrowind 12 years ago that I got this immersed in a game. Highest honors from Eurogamer, the very rare perfect 10 from Gamespot (only 9 games have ever gotten that honor), and raving reviews from virtually every single site you look at, including my personal favorite reviewer Elder Geek. Its one of those few games that gets a 90%+ review rating on Metacritic across both critics and user reviews, and across all platforms. Its crazy that a game this hyped actually exceeds expectations.  The Reddit contrarians looking to pull out their e-pitchforks about the graphical downgrade need to see this game on PC on Ultra, its one of the best looking games ever made. I have modded Skyrim with 4K textures and EMB and Crysis 3 and GTA V on PC. Witcher 3 on PC beats them all visually. Once we get some more visual mods for Witcher 3 its going to be ridiculous.  But much more importantly it sets a new standard for interactivity and choice, where even seemingly minor choices that you make in a side quest ends up coming back to affect the main story 20 hours later. Every game developer should be studying the quests of the Witcher 3, particularly the side quests and how they are deep, meaningful and way more interesting than most games main quest. We often hear developers say how ""the players choices will affect the game world"", but this is the first time in any game that I have ever felt that to be genuinely true. It completely blows the simplistic Bethesda and Bioware approach out of the water in this respect. Optional quests like Tower of Mice can take hours and are way, way more engaging and heart wrenching than any Skyrim, Dragon Age or Mass Effect quest, and even when you think you're making a good decision all sorts of unforseen consequences end up happening in the world, with even entire villages going barren because of a ""good"" decision you made. Some quests like the Bloody Baron quest line will leave you needing to put down the controller and take a walk outside. So many seemingly simple quests end up branching into a dozen different directions, you end up making so many decisions that end up being shown (in both subtle and big ways) in places you never expect. One of the early main quests is ""Use your leads to discover what happened to X"" without quest markers, leaving you to explore the world and use your brain to connect the dots. It is genuinely the greatest quest and choice outcome system ever made, by miles. Going back to playing the quests of Fallout, Mass Effect, any Elder Scrolls game after this is a MASSIVE step back.  The world also feels like a real place, everything as if its handcrafted, instead of the generic copy-pasta that plagues today's game worlds. The character voice acting and expression is incredible, the facial expression beats even LA Noire. You genuinely end up watching the highly detailed NPC faces to try and figure out their intentions. And there is rarely a good vs. bad narrative, its almost always gray and morally unclear. You'll end up pondering your decisions days after you step away from the screen, and the dark world doesn't shy away from some very uncomfortable topics, it treats you like an adult. It will renew your faith in an increasingly troubled industry, and fill even the most jaded gamer with a sense of wonder of how a game this big, complex and well made is even possible. It is a triumph of story telling, player choice, character development, world atmosphere, gameplay, developer-gamer relations (100% DRM free, free DLCs, great physical copy package...etc), voice acting, visual design, music and branching plot depth, a triumph of what a game should be. A triumph that raises the bar for all of gaming. There is no other way to describe it."

Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,holladaddy,3,Fri Jul 10 02:51:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I know I'm just making fun of people who use those kinds of mods. I use mods for things like Project Nevada/SkyRe/Frostfall etc and then all visuals.

Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,MightyGreenPanda,3,Fri Jul 10 02:18:11 2015 UTC,"The art style is usually (or at least in my opinion) much more important than the actual graphics, and that's why there are old games (from the NES to the PS2) that still hold up to day. Although if the graphics are ass, then the art style isn't that helpful."
Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,Jelster64,2,Fri Jul 10 07:41:17 2015 UTC,Extra Credits explained this perfectly.

Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,holladaddy,-10,Thu Jul 16 06:30:12 2015 UTC,"Is this a circlejerk at all? Or is this just defending console gaming to no one in particular on a subreddit that happens to target ridiculous gamers on PC from time to time?   It's kind of old to see this sub just be /r/pcmasterracecounterjerk as often as it is. I dislike people who jerk their e-peen about PC gaming as much as any reasonable person but sometimes it feels like I'll just get downvoted for being a guy who games on PC because it's cool for a lot of reasons.  I dig making fun of irrational, nitpicky, toxic gamer culture. It's funny. Stuff like this is just an imgur link that could go on /r/funny just as easily"
Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,holladaddy,16,Thu Jul 9 15:42:25 2015 UTC,"/uj  I see this  sub as a sort of mix of circlejerk and circlebroke for the big  gaming subs. We have posts like these  that make fun of the big circlejerks, and posts that take the circlejerk to the extreme."
Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,HayleeLOL,8,Thu Jul 9 15:46:36 2015 UTC,"I mean was this a circlejerk post? The sentiment I always see behind a lot of the biggest posts and frequent posters here is just ""I hate PC gaming and PC gamers so much"". Not specific parts of whatever toxic Reddit culture it embodies. It's dumb to see people who are reasonable or making jokes that aren't anti-PC gaming downvoted as frequently as they are on this sub. I definitely don't feel ""oppressed"" but I mean isn't it just as toxic to get riled up about it on the opposing side?  Not referencing you specifically OP. Just kind of the sentiment behind this content and a lot of the common users here that are usually funny but then sometimes just angry."
Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,holladaddy,8,Thu Jul 9 15:51:28 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you there. I sometimes feel like this sub is a little anti-PC gamer, I'm anti-""Master Race"" (as in, the obnoxious little shitheels who insist on pushing PC to everyone) but yeah.  This post in particular feels more anti-PC gamer than normal. I'm more on the left usually. Can someone not as lazy as me make a ""Gamer"" post where it's just the picture on the left posted twice?  I mean... I like this sub, and I actually have some semblance of decent discussion here, along with a good laugh, but I sorta feel this way too."
Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,HayleeLOL,5,Thu Jul 9 16:34:52 2015 UTC,Yeah /r/gamingcirclejerk is a good CJ sub and it's funny and I have longer and better discussions about games here sometimes that don't involve someone jumping down my throat and calling me a shill or SJW or something for liking Ubisoft games or criticizing the writing in The Witcher 3
Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,holladaddy,3,Thu Jul 9 18:43:06 2015 UTC,"I have a good laugh and discussion here too. I've really noticed the better discussions here than the serious gaming subs just because nobody jumps down my throat and shouts at me for being an ""SJW"" or hating the Witcher 3 circlejerk.  I can't say much on TW3 itself yet because I haven't played it, but the circlejerkers really sour me towards playing it."
Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,SuperWeegee4000,2,Fri Jul 10 12:01:43 2015 UTC,It's a good game. But it does have a lot of flaws. Including that you basically have to metagame it in order to avoid over leveling Geralt and ruining the challenge of the game. I don't think that anyone in /r/games cares though because they love having their action figure.
Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,holladaddy,-7,Fri Jul 10 13:46:16 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I feel like people get the wrong idea about the PC Master Race subreddit as well. They clean up their act from time to time, and seem to have matured a lot. There are a few members who are absolute trolls and asshats, so the Tumblr Effect happens."
Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,SuperWeegee4000,8,Thu Jul 9 17:51:16 2015 UTC,"Eh. Most of it isn't a self aware circlejerk. They just make jokes about how cool they are and how dumb everyone else is. It's not ""satire"" it's just ""humor about how inflated we are in a way that inflates us even more"".  It's definitely not a ""mature"" place any more than /r/games or /r/gaming are.   Maybe it has roots in a circlejerk but it's basically just /r/pcgaming + a joke here and there"
Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,holladaddy,-5,Thu Jul 9 18:41:34 2015 UTC,"Ehh, I disagree. I read through the top posts every once in a while, and it's really not as bad as you say."

It's kinda dumb. Oh, and the amount that they hate Beyond Earth is stupid."
Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,holladaddy,10,Fri Jul 10 01:00:48 2015 UTC,"Well, from what I can tell (and please correct me if I'm wrong on this), people here don't have an irrational hatred for any and all things PC gaming related. It's just that (and I say this as a PC gamer myself) most PC gamers you'll meet on Reddit in particular are toxic trolls who are unhealthily obsessed with their chosen gaming platform. I (and I'm sure most everyone here) is aware that not all PC gamers are like that, and that some of us are just guys who like playing video games and choose to do so on PC. But the vocal minority who keeps up this inane barrage of ""LOLOLOL U GUISE R ON XBOX U R EVRYTHNIG RONG WITH TEH INDUSTRY XD"" have kind of usurped the mantle of ""PC gamer"" and made it a very negative thing.  That said, I do agree with your point. If people here start to be as toxic towards PC gamers as PC gamers are towards console gamers, we're really not much better than PCMR."
Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,StaleNinja,7,Thu Jul 9 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"Well, from what I can tell (and please correct me if I'm wrong on this), people here don't have an irrational hatred for any and all things PC gaming related.   I can't really refer to anything specific because these things aren't important enough in my day-to-day to remember. But I know there's a ton of posts that have occurred while I've been subscribed that are just ""look at this guy he's jerking so harddd!!!"" and it's just a guy asking for game recommendations reasonably.   idk it just seems like a lot of ""PC is good"" sentiments are billed as circlejerks and it doesn't make any sense. Like, ""PCs are generally more powerful than consoles and stuff"" even that's just a fact. But I see the circlejerk in ""consoles suck"" and ""if you play on consoles you're dumb"" or even ""I'm somehow clever/smart for switching to PC gaming"" as if it's some kind of new tier of intellectual prowess for an individual.  It hasn't been awful lately but it's equally dumb to assert things like PC gamers owning the nitpicking and anger that's present in all of gaming's shitty culture.  idk let's not just jerk the opposite direction on it because PC Master Race is full of angry 15 year olds with laptops who just want to be Totalbiscuit"
Gamingcirclejerk,3co0lf,hobdodgeries,5,Thu Jul 9 18:38:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I don't hate someone for playing on PC. I hate someone for acting all high and mighty about it like you're gods gift to gaming or some other shit."

Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,antisocially_awkward,4,Wed Jul 8 19:21:24 2015 UTC,That's cool and all but this game could really benefit from a FOV slider
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,xLoloz,5,Wed Jul 8 20:45:46 2015 UTC,"""Overwatch will be patched if needed"" 20/10 best game of all time. Cant wait for lorefriendly witcher 3 dlc"
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,Ace1h,4,Wed Jul 8 20:30:56 2015 UTC,"Really, 2000 upvotes, marked as a rumor post? Do people literally browse the internet looking for hints of some option in a video game? Do these people do anything else"
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,smittyjaja,4,Thu Jul 9 08:51:54 2015 UTC,How is this a circlejerk?
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,holladaddy,8,Wed Jul 8 20:48:45 2015 UTC,"Totalbiscuit says that all games require fov sliders, and his word is law"
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,holladaddy,2,Thu Jul 9 06:31:54 2015 UTC,"Wait how is TB involved in this or implicitly a factor in this? He's a moron but I don't see why it's a circlejerk at all. FOV is an option that games should have, maybe it's not HUGE NEWS and shouldn't be the top of /r/games, that's a bit much"
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,HayleeLOL,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:58:23 2015 UTC,Because people associate FOV options and their importance with Totalbiscuit because he discusses it a lot.
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,holladaddy,2,Thu Jul 9 16:19:39 2015 UTC,"Ugh, that's stupid."
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,HayleeLOL,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:24:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, a lot of first person games might need FOV sliders so that people don't get ill playing them. I don't get it often but when it hits me I get dizzy and disoriented. It's not nice."
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,Liam4242,3,Thu Jul 9 09:08:41 2015 UTC,Clearly you need to replay Witcher 3
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,HayleeLOL,0,Wed Jul 8 21:42:14 2015 UTC,"Because apparently since Totalbiscuit wants FOV sliders in first person games (for a very fair reason might I add; I occasionally get dizzy and disoriented from this, can't imagine what worse cases are like), it automatically belongs on here.  TL:DR if it's something TB is known to be ""for"" with even if it has nothing to do with him, it's a circlejerk. Apparently."
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,holladaddy,3,Thu Jul 9 09:15:11 2015 UTC,"Why? I'm sure Totalbiscuit loves toddlers, kittens, and apple pie too. I think that guy's a dumbass and don't understand what enjoyment people get from watching his content or taking him seriously, but FOV is really just a baseline ""oh, most people understand this is an important thing"" thing. It's not like people getting riled up about SLI support that they will never need to worry about because TB said something about Ubisoft not doing it immediately, I think that's a more common outrage meme"
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,HayleeLOL,2,Thu Jul 9 15:59:53 2015 UTC,"Because, I believe a lot of people automatically associate the FOV thing with him because he mentions it often. It is important, though at the same time a few people do still associate FOV with totalbiscuit as far as I can tell.  I like his stuff but eh, he's not for everyone and I really don't think his word should be gospel.  I was under the impression the FOV thing was posted here because OP thinks it's a circlejerk, because they've associated it with TB.  Indeed it isn't. I didn't even know anything about Ubi not doing SLI support to be honest, not that it affects me at all. What was the kerfuffle?"
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,holladaddy,2,Thu Jul 9 16:16:53 2015 UTC,"Indeed it isn't. I didn't even know anything about Ubi not doing SLI support to be honest, not that it affects me at all. What was the kerfuffle?   It wasn't that SLI support didn't exist, it's just that it was buggy. But that's sort of the nature of SLI and people don't understand it. Having graphics cards work seamlessly to render things together isn't the same thing as having one big beefy GPU twice the power. But that's what Reddit thinks. So when they hear ""SLI is broken"" they think ""this means that not even the biggest PCs can run this well!!!!1111"" not ""oh this is an outlier enthusiast setup that's difficult to implement perfectly and isn't prioritized for development"" which is the truth. Also that SLI doesn't add VRAM or anything on top of that so that will be a factor as well.  Basically people get mad about lack of immediate support at launch for a setup they will never afford or have and will never matter to them. And people with SLI are probably used to it and know to wait for patches or see if the problem is with their rig."
Gamingcirclejerk,3cl3pe,HayleeLOL,2,Thu Jul 9 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly. My boyfriend has an SLI setup, and the amount of times I've been around and his SLI has bugged out meaning he has to use just one card is way more often than Reddit would think.  He even said, having two GPUs isn't like having one big GPU, rather they share the load rather than add together. There's a difference.  Hahaha. Exactly. It's a nice setup, but not without bugs, and many times, my SO only runs one GPU because he actually gets more FPS running one than two.  My SO likes it when SLI support is included, but I've never seen him go all Reddit mode when it's not."
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,Python2k10,20,Tue Jul 7 23:27:49 2015 UTC,"It has. I played it before I saw the circlejerk and really liked it. But now, when I play it, I just feel like I am playing a fad now. And now I can see everything wrong with the game."
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,TheySaidHellsNotHot,7,Tue Jul 7 23:44:43 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't let them ruin it for you. My friends and I despise r/gaming, and whenever we are playing a game that they jerk over, we mock jerk it and it gets pretty funny.  Payday 2: DAE CLOACKER CHAINS PICKLE??

Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,Just4TehLulz,9,Wed Jul 8 06:10:26 2015 UTC,It definitely made me think the game would be way better than it is. There is a lot of issues with the game I don't see discussed cause of the circlejerk.

Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,WillyTheWackyWizard,7,Fri Jul 10 17:35:09 2015 UTC,"I just finished the Witcher 2 in preparation for playing the Witcher 3 which I've heard many positive things about (haha). Honestly, it started out fantastic, like I thought it was going to be one of my instant favorite games of all time, but I thought it really fell off in the second half, ended bizarrely and abruptly, and left a lot to be desired after such a GREAT setup and first chapter. I still expect W3 to be great but now I'm slightly less excited."
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,JJX119,4,Wed Jul 8 00:32:25 2015 UTC,"Don't do the side quests too much. If you over-level the game is no fun. Always try to do things that are 2-5 levels above your level, and maybe more when you get up into the teens and twenties.   The game is unbalanced. It's really hard and rewarding at first and then turns into action figures in the second half. A lot of people get to Skellige and hate it even though it's ab amazing region- it's because they kill everything on site and the combat loses purpose or strategy.   I mean it sucks to ""metagame"" it but I do think there's a ticking clock with what you can really do in the game if you dig the story or the progression to other regions. And I haven't seen mods/patches that address the leveling issues."
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,holladaddy,13,Wed Jul 8 01:03:48 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have to jerk or counterjerk a certain game, just play what you like.   I often like to try the games reddit praises, but I can't get into e.g. Hotline Miami."
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,impact_ftw,5,Tue Jul 7 23:44:43 2015 UTC,"For me it is any valve game. Especially TF2 and CS:GO. I like Portal 2, if that counts for anything."

Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,Throwawaylikeits1992,5,Wed Jul 8 19:15:50 2015 UTC,I have about 40 hours logged and I really do like it. I try to ignore the circlejerk and perceive the game on its own merits. It's a huge and very good RPG with some problems too.
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,bangus_kek,5,Wed Jul 8 01:03:13 2015 UTC,"Without a shadow of a doubt. I wanted to play it before the circlejerk, along with TW1 and 2. However, now I have practically zero want to even get 3, let alone play it. I'm sick to death of hearing about it and how it's the best thing to happen to gaming, and I can only see myself playing it at least 6 months from now when all the hype has possibly died down and it suffers the ""BioShock Infinite"" effect.  I'm also sick of the notion that you can't criticise the game or else your argument will be ""refuted"" by people seeming to make any excuse they can as to why you can't criticise it, with your comment being downvoted and made invisible just because you committed the unforgivable crime of not liking the same thing as everyone else."
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,HayleeLOL,3,Wed Jul 8 09:44:07 2015 UTC,with your comment being downvoted and made invisible just because you committed the unforgivable crime of not liking the same thing as everyone else.   That has been an issue in bother r/gaming and r/games.  Any slight true negative about a popular game and you are attacked.  Really makes me hate the gaming community on reddit.
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,PandahOG,8,Wed Jul 8 14:52:08 2015 UTC,"Not really. It's just been more frustrated that no one wants to talk about the flaws in the gameplay or the story. There's tons to criticize and pick apart and try to discuss but no, it's the game of games. Also people don't even like the cool things about it, they like the tits and blood."
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,holladaddy,-2,Wed Jul 8 01:05:52 2015 UTC,The witcher subreddit goes until criticism very nicely.  Without bitching.
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,MrMango786,4,Wed Jul 8 05:10:06 2015 UTC,I have the same feeling with Fallout: New Vegas. With all the jerking over how much better the writing is in NV compared to 3 going on all the time it just makes me that much more aware of actually not good writing or places where the story just doesn't flow well.   It's like telling your friend that you've just seen the funniest video ever. They're expecting to laugh so much that they start to find everything that doesn't make them laugh to be disappointing.
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,Zeal0tElite,2,Wed Jul 8 02:15:54 2015 UTC,"I very much enjoy the game, though it can be difficult to to just start up and play due to how much shit is going on at any given point. I don't really read much about it online. I just don't really care to. regardless, I think it's pretty fun."
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,hobdodgeries,2,Wed Jul 8 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't played Witcher 3, but I can tell you the circlejerk over TLOU left me disappointed because I was expecting a guaranteed 10/10 video game experience and got what I would consider 8.5/10 or 9/10. I think it's good, but when you go into something thinking your mind will be blown, and it's not, then it literally hasn't met your expectations."
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,omgoctopus,2,Wed Jul 8 15:01:39 2015 UTC,The circlejerk hasn't affected my opinion but I never had any desire to play it anyways. I've played the Witcher 2 a few years ago and tried to get into it but I hated it.
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,cme9,2,Wed Jul 8 01:10:44 2015 UTC,"Yes.  It's worse than The Last of Us, far worse. I've never seen a circlejerk this hard and this ferocious. I do enjoy the game but jesus christ it's not the cure for cancer, and I even hate admitting I like the game because I'm not a circlejerker and it usually results in me being downvoted."

What nakes this bad is that the circle jerk community makes it near impossible to discuss these flaws."
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,PandahOG,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:54:37 2015 UTC,"I am enjoying Witcher 3(I am a big RPG fan), and I cannot say the circlejerk has effected me.  But one game whose circlejerk got in the way of my enjoyment was TLoU. I bought it, seeing the entire internet saying ""its the best fucking game of all time"". With that hype it was mediocre, IMO.   I mean, I can see why people can love it, but personally it was too predictable for me and the gunplay was clunky for my taste. Moreover I was not that fond of the genre. But noooo, "" YOU GOT TO TRY THIS GAME, EVEN IF YOU HATE THE GENRE YOU WOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH IT""  I still haven't finished it yet, and won't be anytime soon"
Gamingcirclejerk,3chjwt,chemx32,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:15:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the reason circlejerking dampens any enjoyment we have of a game is just simple overexposure. We get so sick of seeing anything relating to whatever it is that's being jerked, we just want it to simply go away for a while.  Which is why I'm not picking up The Witcher 3 until this stupid fucking hype train has crashed into a wall or something."

Now I can't even think about witcher 3 without thinking about all the shit fanboys spew.   I personally liked AK way more, witcher 3 was fun, but I felt it was too repetitive. I'm pretty sure I was killing every enemy the same way (keep spamming my attack, if they attack then dodge to the side and spam on the back).

The only conclusion I can come to is that it gets so much shit because it's so popular in spite of how many negative Youtube videos, reddit threads, and twitch comments are made about it.  That drives people crazy.  No one bitches about Evolve anymore because they, that subset of perpetually angry gamers, ""won."" The game came out, no one really plays it anymore, and it probably didn't do so hot financially. People will still take shots at it every now and then, but for the most part, they've moved on. Destiny, however, continues to remain relevant. Not only does it still sell, it is and has consistently been one of he most viewed games on twitch since it came out.  To them, Destiny should have ""died"" a long time ago and because they can't just let it go, they have to tell the world how they feel at every possible moment as if they were on some righteous crusade.  Listen, although I had a lot of fun with it, I don''t think Destiny is anywhere near perfect. Faaaaaar from it in fact. However, the way certain people rally against it is absurd. They talk about it as if it's some colossal fuckup like Drake of the 99 Dragons or Duke Nukem Forever when it's so clearly not. Destiny's worst crime has always been charging too much for not enough, but considering there are plenty of people are loving the game,, I can't really get upset at them."

Why doesn't Ninty (we're close like that) just release everything on steam? It would be cheaper for me. I wouldn't have to steal money from my moms purse every night. Plus I can just download it 4 free . Lol Mario Kart isn't worth 60 bucks even though I'll put 500 hours into it.    The biggest reason Wii Y is kil is NO WITCHER 3 in case that wasn't mention.   Plz Nintendo make a dank and gritty Pokeman game .

Gamingcirclejerk,3bfjw1,Lumenarious,2,Mon Jun 29 05:00:41 2015 UTC,"/uj  That's good. The game looks really fun, I was a huge fan of Arkham City and Arkham Origins. Never played the original.   Really? I can't think of a justification for the choices made with that port. Arkham city ran perfectly on my laptop from 2010. I don't see why Arkham Knight doesn't work well on say, Jim Sterling's gaming computer. There's no reason for a game, especially a PC game to be locked at 30 fps. If you want to fps lock your game, put it in the options menu. Not on the ini files. The game isn't even that graphically intensive. I fail to see an excuse for that port."
Gamingcirclejerk,3bfjw1,TheySaidHellsNotHot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:10:39 2015 UTC,"yeah the port is shit, i actually bought the game so no one knows better than me  but again my problem is the childish behavior of the gamers, like yeah, gotta wait for the patch, boo fucking hoo  i mean if you watched Jim's video you might have also noticed that even if the game stuttered like hell on his beast pc, he was relaxed and chill the whole time, and there is a reason for that...   now that i think about he might have made the video deliberately with that ""who cares"" tone  o yeah also gotta mention that arkham city WAS a piece of shit at launch too, don't act like it's some kind of saint.."

Indie games are a bit different.   Yeah, I think Jim is used to shit quality though. I watched TB's video as well, and it was intereesting, since he is all about advocating for quality in PC games, where as Jim is more focused on indie devs and early acces games, so it makes sense that Jim wouldn't be as outraged. I didn't play Arkham city at launch, I just bought it in November."

Galaxy took that away and tried to sell ""you walk upside down sometimes"" as a major change in the formula.   Galaxy is a fun game, but let's call a spade a spade here. They made a full game of the parts of the previous game where the clearest innovation (or as someone else put it well, discernible difference) is stripped away."
Gamingcirclejerk,3b420x,RushofBlood52,0,Fri Jun 26 16:05:44 2015 UTC,I guess we'll have to agree to disagree here. At the surface sure it's just the difference in gravity. But it has way more environments as sunshine was limited to the beach theme. Introduced the 'launch star' to streamline the platforming so you go straight from obstacle to obstacle. There's 'pull stars' as well as a few other new mechanics. And I'd say the gravity puzzles alone are as unique as FLUDD. There's enough there for one to easily see a 'discernable difference'. But I wouldn't call either of those games particularly innovative

Gamingcirclejerk,3b03ol,Lumenarious,3,Thu Jun 25 14:57:02 2015 UTC,"Why does it suck? Performance? I mean I'm sort of getting the impression it performs the same way the console versions do... 30FPS is stable and 60 isn't. That's a bummer. but not the same as ending the world. Yeah, they made a good call pulling the game off the shelves for PC.  I also get the impression a good deal of the outcry is similar to the rage against Unity... that people might be... a little bit out of touch with how much work their hardware can do with modern games and need to lower their settings or upgrade. Not entirely the case, but I'm sure it's a factor as well.  Maybe I'll play it when it's $5  I love how there's that 60FPS Nvidia video floating aroung and people say it's fake because of ""chipmunk voices""... lol. There are normal voices in that video too and it'd take like two seconds to correct the pitch on any in game audio if they were really doctoring it."

It's not that I necessarily hate other people's excitement, but I just the best way I can think of putting it is being at a party you don't wanna be at anymore. It's like ""cool alright, everyone is having fun, that's nice, but I really wanna go home and rest. Everyone is too loud and it's getting annoying."""

Gamingcirclejerk,3avylp,cbfw86,3,Wed Jun 24 05:03:13 2015 UTC,"Hey remember brink on reddit?   I still get amused by means of schadenfreude everytime I think about how the reddit gaming community got their hopes up, hyped the game as the for sure game of the year and then were massively dissapointed.   Reddit sort of turned me off of The Last of Us, I remember wanting to get it but not acting on it immediately, thinking it would be a cool survival game with great graphics, but all the preaching about the game's story and le giraffes really turned me off and made me think it would turn out to be some sort of cheesy, over-emotional, generic zombie movie plot. Oh wait they're not zombies theyre fungi monsters!! Who happen to work exactly like zombies. I think that because a lot of AAA games these days don't put that much importance in their stories, people aren't used to slightly-less-generic ideas. If last of us were a movie it would be an OK zombie/survival movie, better than I Am Legend, worse than, maybe, The Road for example. But because it's a video game and we haven't explored every movie trope just yet, people think this is absolute ingenuity, and hits hard with ""the feels""  Also spec ops the line looks like a very generic, boring shooter that gets overabundant praise by telling you ""sometimes you have to kill good people to do things and that's sad and you should hate yourself. By the way, you're an awful person. "" It's cool that the developers made a game like this instead of a random shooter, but at this point maybe we should just hope/expect  games have well done or important stories and not fellate developers for what they should kinda be doing already?"

He talked so long about how some people are made nauseous by lower fovs and how games should allow this to change. I know low FOV makes some people feel uneasy, but is it so big an issue that he has to devote so much discussion to it? Is he so egotistical that he needs to publicize widely what he has done for the gaming community? Also he's not arguing a heated topic, everybody agrees more configurability would be better. He was kind of just making a non-statement, saying ""more options in games are better. "" He's already gotten them to add the option in the game, does he really have to rally people up towards that notion? All he had to do was say, ""Hey guys, for those of you who felt uneasy with D2 in the past, there's a new FOV slider!""

Gamingcirclejerk,3ani59,_swamp,2,Wed Jun 24 01:45:56 2015 UTC,"/uj  My real problem isn't that it's free, or even that it's already on disc, it's that Nintendo told everyone that they'd be receiving new content over a given period of time when, in reality, the content was in no way new and was in fact already on the disc. They tricked everyone into believing that they were doing something good by providing cool new content when they were really just being facetious about how they unveiled content that already existed. Essentially, they got to play the good guy by pretending to be the good guy. That irks me. Had they informed players that it was all on disc, I really wouldn't have cared at all."
Gamingcirclejerk,3ani59,Jelster64,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:35:35 2015 UTC,"The same could be said about CDPR. They scored a ton of PR points by pulling their little ""free DLC for everyone!"" stunt. We've come to expect DLC to be meaningful content (in the sense that it adds several hours of play to the game). Games that charge for DLC typically offer a decent value for the cost. What they really gave away was micro DLC, exactly the kind of micro DLC that would be used as pre-order incentives (and everyone would bitch about how it isn't worth pre-ordering for a few costumes and an extra side quest, of course). The implications of DLC versus micro DLC and the expectations that people have for those are entirely different. The Witcher 3 doesn't have free DLC, it has free micro DLC. We still get the privilege of giving CDPR more money for the real DLC.  And then there's the fact that some of it was ready at launch. For all we know, they could have held back some stuff from the game to give away for ""free"" as a part of their marketing campaign. It doesn't cost us anything but the community pays them back through rampant circlejerking about how great CDPR is for doing that. They got tons of free publicity from that. We still see it today and it's been a month since the game came out."

Dark Souls only appeals to us hardcore gamers who downloaded a Contra ROM once grew up playing totally hard Nintendo games and was a starry-eyed child who found amusement anywhere because I was a child appreciated them for their artistic merit.

I LOVE platinum games but wonderful 101 is a chore to playthrough compared to their other games. The combo system is completely broken because of the tablet controls (you need to draw what weapon you want) I can guarantee you will only use Sword and Fist because they are the easiest and fastest thing to draw. It has some great ideas but so far from the goddamn hype I hate the fanfare around the WiiU so much blind praise over nothing.

Gamingcirclejerk,39gfkb,doomsday1216,2,Thu Jun 11 16:44:31 2015 UTC,"That's what they're upset about, though, it seems. That they've been given the preorder bonuses without seeing gameplay. I'm not saying I agree, but i don't know that ""they haven't shown any gameplay"" means we should be reserving judgement.  I, for one, am disappointed that there's a pre-order gun that does extra bonus damage (if that is true, I have no idea of it is.)"
Gamingcirclejerk,39gfkb,StaleNinja,3,Fri Jun 12 15:32:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm pretty sure they're upset because they are, themselves, trying to pass judgement on it before we've seen anything.  Also, if I may ask, how do you figure we shouldn't reserve judgement? If we haven't seen any gameplay, then we have no idea what the game will actually be like. The game is still more or less an unknown, so it would be like trying to judge a book by it's cover in a quite literal fashion.  As for the pre-order bonus weapon, I haven't heard anything, and I think that /r/gaming would be grabbing their pitchforks and spreading it all over the Internet if it were. If you happen to have a link, I'd appreciate it.  (Also, I hope this didn't come across as rude, I'm just trying to ask a question. Sorry if it didn't come out quite how I'd planned.)"

Gamingcirclejerk,39gqy6,StillApony,13,Thu Jun 11 16:41:25 2015 UTC,"I've said this before, but it bears repeating: It is one of the best games ever made. I've been a gamer for nearly 20 years now and this is one of those landmarks for gaming, which establishes a new standard. Every open world game, every story driven game and every RPG will be compared to this. This is the first time since Morrowind 12 years ago that I got this immersed in a game. Highest honors from Eurogamer, the very rare perfect 10 from Gamespot (only 9 games have ever gotten that honor), and raving reviews from virtually every single site you look at, including my personal favorite reviewer Elder Geek. Its one of those few games that gets a 90%+ review rating on Metacritic across both critics and user reviews, and across all platforms. Its crazy that a game this hyped actually exceeds expectations.  The Reddit contrarians looking to pull out their e-pitchforks about the graphical downgrade need to see this game on PC on Ultra, its one of the best looking games ever made. I have modded Skyrim with 4K textures and EMB and Crysis 3 and GTA V on PC. Witcher 3 on PC beats them all visually. Once we get some more visual mods for Witcher 3 its going to be ridiculous.   But much more importantly it sets a new standard for interactivity and choice, where even seemingly minor choices that you make in a side quest ends up coming back to affect the main story 20 hours later. Every game developer should be studying the quests of the Witcher 3, particularly the side quests and how they are deep, meaningful and way more interesting than most games main quest. We often hear developers say how ""the players choices will affect the game world"", but this is the first time in any game that I have ever felt that to be genuinely true. It completely blows the simplistic Bethesda and Bioware approach out of the water in this respect. Optional quests like Tower of Mice can take hours and are way, way more engaging and heart wrenching than any Skyrim, Dragon Age or Mass Effect quest, and even when you think you're making a good decision all sorts of unforseen consequences end up happening in the world, with even entire villages going barren because of a ""good"" decision you made. Some quests like the Bloody Baron quest line will leave you needing to put down the controller and take a walk outside.  So many seemingly simple quests end up branching into a dozen different directions, you end up making so many decisions that end up being shown (in both subtle and big ways) in places you never expect. One of the early main quests is ""Use your leads to discover what happened to X"" without quest markers, leaving you to explore the world and use your brain to connect the dots. It is genuinely the greatest quest and choice outcome system ever made, by miles. Going back to playing the quests of Fallout, Mass Effect, any Elder Scrolls game after this is a MASSIVE step back.  The world also feels like a real place, everything as if its handcrafted, instead of the generic copy-pasta that plagues today's game worlds. The character voice acting and expression is incredible, the facial expression beats even LA Noire. You genuinely end up watching the highly detailed NPC faces to try and figure out their intentions. And there is rarely a good vs. bad narrative, its almost always gray and morally unclear. You'll end up pondering your decisions days after you step away from the screen, and the dark world doesn't shy away from some very uncomfortable topics, it treats you like an adult. It will renew your faith in an increasingly troubled industry, and fill even the most jaded gamer with a sense of wonder of how a game this big, complex and well made is even possible.  It is a triumph of story telling, player choice, character development, world atmosphere, gameplay, developer-gamer relations (100% DRM free, free DLCs, great physical copy package...etc), voice acting, visual design, music and branching plot depth, a triumph of what a game should be. A triumph that raises the bar for all of gaming.  There is no other way to describe it."

To the point of being overwhelmed.  Gwent felt like a dumbed down version of MTG, but again low on the list.

Gamingcirclejerk,39fduq,godofdae,20,Thu Jun 11 10:22:28 2015 UTC,"I've been a fascist for nearly 20 years now and this is one of those landmarks for war crimes, which establishes a new standard. Every world war, every civil war and every battle will be compared to this. This is the first time since World War II 70 years ago that I got this immersed in a genocide. Highest honors from Mussolini, the very rare perfect 10 from Hitler (only 9 times has this honor been given out), and gleeful smiles from virtually every single Nazi you look at, including my personal favorite reviewer Hermann Gestappo. Its one of those few wars that gets a 90%+ death toll on concentration camps across both civilian and military casualties, and across all theatres. Its crazy that a bomb this hyped actually exceeds expectations.  The Soviet conscriptss looking to pull out their pitchforks about the human rights violations use this bomb on Paris on Ultra, its one of the best looking bombs ever made. I have modded V2  rockets with 4 tonnes of tnt and EMP and Napalm and MOABS on Paris. Hitler-3 on PC beats them all visually. Once we get some more explosive rounds for Hitler-3 its going to be ridiculous.  But much more importantly it sets a new standard for interactivity and choice, where even seemingly minor choices that you make in a concentration camp ends up coming back to affect the torture victim 20 hours later. Every fascist dictator should be studying the glory of the Hitler-3, particularly the camp system and how they are deep, meaningful and way more interesting than most shooting lines. We often hear hippies say how ""humanity's choices will affect the world"", but this is the first time in any war that I have ever felt that to be genuinely true. It completely blows up the simplistic Jews and Gipsies out of their homes in this respect. Optional war crimes like Aushwitz can take hours and are way, way more engaging and heart wrenching than any Soviet, American or Japanese war crime, and even when you think you're making a good decision all sorts of unforeseen jews end up escaping into the world, with even entire countries going barren because of a good decision you made. Some battles like Stalingrad v2.0 will leave you needing to put down the panzerfaust  and take a walk outside. So many seemingly simple PoWs end up scattering into a dozen different directions, you end up making so many shots that end up hitting (in both subtle and big ways) in places you never expect. One of the early war crimes is ""Use your leads to discover what happened to Jews"" without help of the Gestappo, leaving you to explore the concentration camp and use your Luger to kill the jews. It is genuinely the greatest feeling and immersive system ever made, by miles. Going back to playing the war crimes of Soviets, Japanese, any Allied power after this is a MASSIVE step back.  The world also feels like a terrible place, everything as if its jewish, instead of the glorious master race that is the fatherland. The people's screams and expression is incredible, their loss of hope beats even dying men. You genuinely end up watching the highly bloodied tortured faces to try and figure out their intentions. And there is always a good vs. bad narrative, its almost never gray and morally unclear. You'll end up celebrating your decisions days after you step away from the panzer, and the dark world doesn't shy away from some very uncomfortable topics, it treats you like an Nazi. It will renew your faith in eugenics, and fill even the most jaded fascist with a sense of wonder of how a war this big, complex and well planned is even possible.  It is a triumph of war crimes, torture tactics, executions, aerial bombings, strategy, Aryan-jewish relations (100% Death rate, free showers, great physical torture...etc), screeams, gore, music and branching fascist roots, a triumph of what a war should be.

This game though, really blew me away. It is my current favorite video game of all time. A spot previously held by Red Dead Redemption."

Gamingcirclejerk,39cf14,PuhLEEEEZEBelieveIt,12,Wed Jun 10 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"/r/pcmasterrace doesn't understand the point of exclusives. I mean, they are there to give people a reason to buy the console.  But no I forgot DAE ps4.20 has no good gaimz? not wurth a buye guyys"
Gamingcirclejerk,39cf14,TheySaidHellsNotHot,14,Wed Jun 10 22:42:35 2015 UTC,"It's a vicious cycle of stupidity.  ""Omg these consoles aren't worth buying. There are no good games for them!"" ...then good games come out and they're all like ""omg exclusives need to die. they're bad for the industry because no one wins. im not buying a console!""  As a side note though, and it kinda sorta ties into the above, I find it funny they complain whenever treats them like pirates and yet there are numerous posts in that thread talking about how to emulate the old KH games. Apologies for getting all preachy, but they deserve to be treated like pirates when they pirate games that are readily available. ""But I don't want to buy <insert console here> just to play <insert game here>."" Well, tough shit! Video games aren't a right. They aren't owed to anyone. Just because you don't feel like buying something doesn't suddenly make it okay. I can understand emulating some old, obscure rpg that they only printed 6 1/2 copies of and isn't available digitally or something ludicrous like that, but if you want to play something like KH, which you can easily and cheaply purchase for the PS3, then you should suck it up and pay for it.  Sorry, but that shit really irks the hell out of me lol"
Gamingcirclejerk,39cf14,TheySaidHellsNotHot,-2,Wed Jun 10 23:38:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this, except for the part about piracy. Though, I suppose I am biased, since I do support piracy. Plus, I don't think it really applies to games that are over ten years and a generation old. I don't even think it is still sold at retail, and even if you buy it used, it's not like the devs are earning money from it. And the part about the ps3 is a bit different, since they aren't emulating the PS3 version of the games, they are emulating the ps2 version.   No need to apologize. The latter irritates me a ton. if you really want a modern game that much, and if it is still sold at retail, just buy the damn console."

Gamingcirclejerk,39biey,PuhLEEEEZEBelieveIt,2,Wed Jun 10 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"I've said this before, but it bears repeating: It is one of the best games ever made. I've been a gamer for nearly 20 years now and this is one of those landmarks for gaming, which establishes a new standard. Every open world game, every story driven game and every RPG will be compared to this. This is the first time since Morrowind 12 years ago that I got this immersed in a game. Highest honors from Eurogamer, the very rare perfect 10 from Gamespot (only 9 games have ever gotten that honor), and raving reviews from virtually every single site you look at, including my personal favorite reviewer Elder Geek. Its one of those few games that gets a 90%+ review rating on Metacritic across both critics and user reviews, and across all platforms. Its crazy that a game this hyped actually exceeds expectations.  The Reddit contrarians looking to pull out their e-pitchforks about the graphical downgrade need to see this game on PC on Ultra, its one of the best looking games ever made. I have modded Skyrim with 4K textures and EMB and Crysis 3 and GTA V on PC. Witcher 3 on PC beats them all visually. Once we get some more visual mods for Witcher 3 its going to be ridiculous.   But much more importantly it sets a new standard for interactivity and choice, where even seemingly minor choices that you make in a side quest ends up coming back to affect the main story 20 hours later. Every game developer should be studying the quests of the Witcher 3, particularly the side quests and how they are deep, meaningful and way more interesting than most games main quest. We often hear developers say how ""the players choices will affect the game world"", but this is the first time in any game that I have ever felt that to be genuinely true. It completely blows the simplistic Bethesda and Bioware approach out of the water in this respect. Optional quests like Tower of Mice can take hours and are way, way more engaging and heart wrenching than any Skyrim, Dragon Age or Mass Effect quest, and even when you think you're making a good decision all sorts of unforseen consequences end up happening in the world, with even entire villages going barren because of a ""good"" decision you made. Some quests like the Bloody Baron quest line will leave you needing to put down the controller and take a walk outside.  So many seemingly simple quests end up branching into a dozen different directions, you end up making so many decisions that end up being shown (in both subtle and big ways) in places you never expect. One of the early main quests is ""Use your leads to discover what happened to X"" without quest markers, leaving you to explore the world and use your brain to connect the dots. It is genuinely the greatest quest and choice outcome system ever made, by miles. Going back to playing the quests of Fallout, Mass Effect, any Elder Scrolls game after this is a MASSIVE step back.  The world also feels like a real place, everything as if its handcrafted, instead of the generic copy-pasta that plagues today's game worlds. The character voice acting and expression is incredible, the facial expression beats even LA Noire. You genuinely end up watching the highly detailed NPC faces to try and figure out their intentions. And there is rarely a good vs. bad narrative, its almost always gray and morally unclear. You'll end up pondering your decisions days after you step away from the screen, and the dark world doesn't shy away from some very uncomfortable topics, it treats you like an adult. It will renew your faith in an increasingly troubled industry, and fill even the most jaded gamer with a sense of wonder of how a game this big, complex and well made is even possible.  It is a triumph of story telling, player choice, character development, world atmosphere, gameplay, developer-gamer relations (100% DRM free, free DLCs, great physical copy package...etc), voice acting, visual design, music and branching plot depth, a triumph of what a game should be. A triumph that raises the bar for all of gaming.  There is no other way to describe it."
