Anyways, I digress.  Hidden deep in the Dark Web (and only after entering an unusually complex search query - ""ann arbor ticket appeal"") , I found this site:  Parking Ticket Contesting - Invalid Reasons:   I only parked in that space for a few minutes. I didnt see the sign. Im not familiar with parking regulations. I didnt have change. Or I was going to get change. I did not intend to park illegally. There aren't enough legal/convenient parking spaces. No one else received a ticket. I have never received a ticket before in the area. The fine is too much.   However, do take the advice of the rest of this forum and take the time out of your day to plead your case.  As you can see, others have had luck."

I went to one of the used book stores in town trying to get a deal for Christmas.  I asked the clerk how to know what was age appropriate, since I know Manga has nudity.  The guy looked at me and basically asked what my problem was with nudes.  I said I don't have a problem for me, but I'm not buying porn for my tween.  Then some woman comes out of the stacks and says that boys need to learn from some where.  I replied, well, it won't be from comics, tyvm.  Then ANOTHER person comes out and starts lecturing me on how kids are going to have sex and I need to stop sheltering them.  I have three people all lecturing me on wtf why am I not giving my 12/13 yr-old naked women for Christmas.  Whenever anyone asks me what it's like living in A2, I bring up that story."

AnnArbor,3dx70x,lurker69,6,Mon Jul 20 18:27:01 2015 UTC,"A few years back, I was looking for cool places to hang out and found a meet n great group on meetup. Ann Arbor is about a 90 minute drive, but I figure whatever I don't have anything better to do.  So I drive into the city, and realize I have no clue how AA operates (parking? One way streets? Locations? It's my first time in town). I follow a bunch of parking signs, and end up a some long term parking structure. I'm not sure I'll remember where I parked, you I snap a picture as I walking away (at least I can ask someone later if they know the location in my picture is, right?).  I found the bar, and they have a ""white elephant"". Then, there's a bunch of games, beer, and pool. I wander over to the pool tables, and sort of hang out watching and chatting with the others.  My turn comes up, and I start playing. Then someone suggests the restaurant down the street, but I've just ordered a beer and the game is pretty close. Most people head out. Before long, it's just me and another guy called Jim. We play for a while, then the waitress tells us they're closing up early.  Jim and I go searching for food.  But apparently Jim isn't from AA either.  He found the same group, and drove from some town I've never heard of within an hour or so. We walk around, but can't find too many open places. Eventually, we find a late night diner, but they only take  cash. Jim offers to cover for me, after digging through my pockets only yields around ten bucks. I opt to order light.   We eat and chat for quite a while, then head out. At the corner I tell him I have to go find out where I parked. He offers to drive me too help, but I tell him I'll walk. He says see you later, gets in his car, and leaves.   Now, it's really dark and I'm wandering around trying to remember which way to the parking structure. Occasionally, I pull out my phone and check the picture against the visible skyline. About 20 minutes later, I find it.   After getting in my car, I realized I'd just been on a date. I've spent the night hanging out with Jim. We took a moonlit walk through the city, and he offered to buy me dinner. We chatted, and I'm so awkward around new people I may have led him on. He may have been The One.  I don't know if anything would have come from it, seeing as I'm a 30 year old straight male, but I guess we'll never know.  And that, Friends, was my first of many trips to AA, and the first (possibly) of many (unlikely) a man's heart I've broken."
AnnArbor,3dx70x,moongirli,2,Mon Jul 20 22:26:26 2015 UTC,"While going to school at Eastern (which is how I ended up moving up here permanently), I was out at night in the middle of winter. My film class had mandatory film viewings, and that was the only one I could make with my work schedule.  I'm walking home (I lived in the apartments on campus), and I swear I hear somebody behind me.  I try to kind of inconspicuously look, but can't see anything in the snow. Keep walking. Still feel like someone is right behind me.  Walk faster.  Still can't shake it. Finally, I swing around, and almost clobber some chick with my backpack. I kind of just stare at her for a minute and she says, ""I wasn't going to hurt you.""  She walked off, and I ran home."
AnnArbor,3dx70x,MilkyVillager,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:38:54 2015 UTC,"Working downtown always carries its daily adventures. The experience that carries the kicker happened about a year ago.  I had just clocked in to manage the second shift at the Michigan Theater. Within 15 minutes some policemen entered the building asking for help to block off pedestrian passage through the graffiti/tripper's alley. When I asked why, they mentioned that someone had jumped from the Liberty Square parking structure into said alley.   I helped them with their every request, but when the fire department arrived was when the most challenging part happened, as they were in charge of ""cleaning up the mess.""  Here I was, in charge of admitting patrons to two busy movies and dealing with the investigation and cleanup of an apparent suicide. Not creepy, I know, but one fire fighter's quote will haunt me forever.  He entered the building post-investigation and asked me if there was a water source near the back door. I pointed him towards the secondary janitor's closet and he thanked me. He followed it up by saying, ""you know what I need this water for, eh?"" I replied with, ""of course.""   He then said, ""His brains are EVERYWHERE.""   It wasn't quite the day I had expected."

The layout was great for a roommate situation (2 full baths, bedrooms at opposite ends of the apartment). I think you can get similar apts in other locations as well, so if you'd rather be closer to the mall and I-94, some of the other complexes mentioned would probably work just great."

It's on the west side, so you're not dealing with lots of loud college kids, and it's tucked back off of the main roads so it's fairly quiet. It's easy walking/biking distance to downtown, right on the bus line, close to multiple grocery stores, laundry in the unit, well-maintained property. I've renewed my lease twice already.  Their leases come up for renewal in late July so there should be a number of open units at the moment."
AnnArbor,3dw9n2,dingus420,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:45:41 2015 UTC,A few months back I searched pretty intensely for places that were pet friendly and it was extremely difficult to find one that was both pet friendly and within reasonable walking distance to downtown.  If you're okay with living a bit far from downtown these two seem like pretty solid choices. I almost ended up living at one of these places but I decided that I would rather pay more to live closer to downtown.  http://www.apartments.com/arbor-village-apartments-ann-arbor-mi/932d865/  http://www.apartments.com/ann-arbor-woods-ann-arbor-mi/qswnlmz/

I spent 10 years in ann arbor/ypsilanti…from high school until after graduate school…and i can tell you for a fact: U of M students mostly want to socialize with other U of M students…and Ypsilanti can be dangerous if you aren't careful.  Ann Arbor has lots of arts and groups and things to do but is kinda for 'rich people' and Ypsilanti is a more inviting place where girls don't need to see your credentials to give you a chance and a beer isn't a rip off.

There are plenty of bars and restaurants downtown that don't cater to students. There is always a festival, concert, or other free activity going on. My friends from college love to come drink and hang out in Ann Arbor with me. I think Midwestern people are generally friendly and it is possible to make friends. I have made friends with the people I work with. We have weekly beer nights and a homebrew club. I also know several coworkers who have made friends through meetup.com gatherings.   Raleigh is not a bad area by any means, but for a small city, Ann Arbor has a lot going for it.

AnnArbor,3co7n4,Volkl2112,8,Thu Jul 9 15:48:11 2015 UTC,FYI because there has been so much rain this year the river is moving noticeably faster than usual. I finished the trip from Argo to Gallup in under 90 minutes last weekend. It was so fast we thought about going again.
AnnArbor,3co7n4,bruinslacker,3,Thu Jul 9 19:00:33 2015 UTC,/u/Volkl2112 has it right.   Meijer has good tubes for $20. I went to Dunhams and bought a $7 plastic paddle to help with steering. Beer and cooler is a must.

Park a car anywhere north of Barton damn, drive up river, park and then float. It's super fun finding your own put in and making your own route and it's cheaper. My favorite is the paladin plant (zeeb and Huron river dr) to Delhi metro park (7 bucks to leave a car there). Good luck boss. You'll have a ball either way!"
AnnArbor,3co7n4,kpyoung,5,Thu Jul 9 15:59:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, everyone is seriously wrong if they're telling you to start at Argo.  Hudson Mills to Barton is the area you should float.  But it keeps people off my water so it's cool. Keep floating Ann Arbor. No fish there anyways.  Edit: Just so everyone here knows, the river is extremely high for this time of year. Usually we are below 300cfs on this gauge. We're currently at levels around double that. Local fishing shop guys usually go by the rule 750cfs for the experienced, 500 for the inexperienced on the river. We're right around that level for the inexperienced to be okay.   If you're floating the river know a few things:  We have had incredible flows this summer, and there will be new debris where there wasn't before. This could be sticks, logs or even rocks that have moved and made the river less safe.   The water has a good stain and is not completely clear right now, so you may have a hard time seeing things underwater.  You will move much faster on the river with these high flows. What took you 3 hours to float last year may only take 1-2.  And please don't trash the river."
AnnArbor,3co7n4,weatherwar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:34:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing a flow gauge on that link you posted.  Also, how long does it take to float from Hudson to Barton?"

AnnArbor,3co7n4,girlwithabird-,4,Thu Jul 9 23:20:45 2015 UTC,"Did this last year and actually plan on doing this again on Saturday too. Typically start at Argo, go down those little rapids, and then float down to Gallup Park. It takes a lot longer, but the water gets deeper closer to Gallup and the current isn't as strong, so it's nice to get off the tube and swim in the river (which is quite clean, it just gets its color from the dirt the current kicks up from the bottom of the river).  I would suggest having a friend leave their car at Gallup so it's a bit easier to return to Argo. Also, if you want to go beyond the rapids, you have to bring your own tube. Rental tubes can only be used at the rapids by Argo."

For beer, any of the breweries are a nice place to eat and get some good beer (Arbor Brewing CO., Blue Tractor, Jolly Pumpkin). Alternatively, Hopcat and Ashley's have a huge selection of beer on tap, and I like the food.  If you like whiskey's, The Raven's Club is my favorite place for bourbon, and The Last Word is the place for Scotch. Both of them have good cocktails too.

Never underestimate people's willingness to make money off the unsuspecting by selling counterfeit tickets.

AnnArbor,3bvxyn,earthwormjim91,2,Thu Jul 2 18:59:23 2015 UTC,"If you're not familiar with the healthcare system here, keep in mind that you probably won't be able to go to just any health provider.  Depending on the plan you choose, the plan may have a list of ""in-network"" and ""out-of-network"" health providers.  ""In-network"" people have an agreement with the insurance, and they are much cheaper for you to go to.  You can probably go out of network and get some coverage, but not as much.  Also, vision insurance is usually separate (coverage for glasses, contacts, sometimes other eye health), as is dental, as someone mentioned.  edit: this page is a good start for getting an idea of how health insurance works in the USA."

AnnArbor,3bvxyn,lugabs11,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:46:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely healthcare.gov to compare policies. Make sure whatever policy you choose includes coverage at The University of Michigan and/or St. Joseph's.   Blue Cross is the biggest in Michigan and accepted almost everywhere. It's expensive and they don't pay for half of the things you think they should, but they may be your best choice. Be careful about the size of the deductible and co-pays - you can easily go broke even with health insurance here.   There are some very tough choices to make: HMO (cheaper) vs PPO (more flexible), Blue Cross vs others, which hospital systems to use, etc. The cheapest Blue Cross HMO policy is probably the most common for individuals.  You may be eligible for government assistance to pay for health insurance too - healthcare.gov will let you know. I'm not sure how it works for non-citizens.   Most of the Blue Cross policies don't include dental even though the law requires minors to have dental insurance, so that'll be an extra policy/expense."

Check out apartment listings on Craig's list and the Internet to get an idea of what's available on your budget. If you need to go less expensive but near by, look at Pittsfield Township and Northwest Ypsilanti. Very close, on the bus line to downtown Ann Arbor, but less expensive."

There are some films with reasonable budgets that get shot in and around the town.  You should be skeptical of really crazy stuff but there have been a few big productions shot in ann arbor in the last few years and there is definitely a local market.

AnnArbor,3az3cv,sewiv,3,Wed Jun 24 20:09:32 2015 UTC,One thing to do is make a new patient appointment for whenever and then call back about the thyroid. If you have an emergent issue they get you in sooner.  If it's family medicine at briarwood they had a very popular MD with a lot of patients die some years ago. They tried to spread the patient load out but may still be overloaded.  I go to family medicine at d'farms. They seem to have reasonable wait times.

AnnArbor,3az3cv,Sotty63,2,Fri Jun 26 17:17:33 2015 UTC,Let's just say I'm really knowledgeable about the local healthcare scene... I know a lot of people at UMHS and almost nome of them uses it for primary care.    I'm in the same position and almost everyone I know uses family medicine. It's best to avoid main hospital based doctors due to long waits when you do have an appointment.
AnnArbor,3az3cv,moration,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:10:25 2015 UTC,What is your insurance? There are U of M affiliated hospitals and doctors in ypsi that generally have openings and will get rid of your new patient status with U of M hospitals and then you can try to reschedule with a more convenient location in A2 with either the same doctor or different doctor in the same group.
AnnArbor,3az3cv,nbx909,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:49:15 2015 UTC,"Welcome to A2! Have you tried having your old primary care doctor write a referral? I had my old primary care write me a referral and got in within a month instead of waiting.   Sorry, but I do not have any recommendations for doctors, as I am seen as U of M, but best of luck!"
AnnArbor,3az3cv,1gaybro,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:46:12 2015 UTC,I recently moved away from Ann Arbor and used www.zocdoc.com to find a doctor. It was really useful! I got in within one week.
AnnArbor,3az3cv,purpleandpenguins,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:47:12 2015 UTC,"You should see which doctors participate in your insurance plan, then call those doctors and ask if they have openings."
AnnArbor,3az3cv,TreeTownAdvisor,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"Usually, different offices take different insurance. You can call your insurance company and ask them for a list of primary care doctors in A2 that are covered.  Get several names so that you are not dealing with waiting until November.   When you call to book, do not tell them it is simply an establishing appointment; tell them you have a thyroid that needs to be looked at (and any relevant details) so that they can schedule you sooner if they possibly can. You can also tell them you will take cancellations and to call you if one comes up.   Dr Elizabeth Shadigian of Women Safe Health in A2 runs a unique practice. She is likely to be out of network, as she has no billing staff, so all insurance claims are submitted by patients themselves. However, this can still end up being less than a copay at a different doctors office (as it is for me), and the level of care she provides is incredible. I have two complex chronic conditions and she is the perfect managing doctor to help look at the whole picture and communicate with my specialists. Even if I just needed a GP or GYN, I would see her. She is with her patients as long as they need. She was a UofM Dr for 19 years and wanted to provide a level of care that is not possible in a busy environment where everything is done on a tight time schedule and by the book instead of by the patient. I'm just adding all of this as a personal recommendation for a doctor who will see you ASAP and treat you very, very well. Her office and mentality is a little new agey, but she is a highly experienced and respected medical doctor, so I try to ignore the zen gardens and papyrus script everywhere ;)    If you want any more recommendations or info, I've been dealing with the healthcare system in the A2 area for awhile. This stuff is a pain in the ass, but it's totally doable :)  Good luck!"

It will still be a lot more bright than going 9 miles or so down carpenter  /23 and into Milan. Sure, there is a prison there, but it's primarily all farms and fields. Downtown Milan consists of a couple tiny intersecting streets. Watch from east of town somewhere under Darling Road or at least south of Oakville-Milan to get away from the street lights. Crosswinds Marsh is a significant ways east, but is a sanctioned preserve with marked paths which may feel a lot safer to you than a field in the middle of nowhere.   I used to run Oxbow Horse Farms w/two of my BFF's in Milan, and the stars are much better there than in A2 proper. You could also go to a state park or local preserve but should definitely bring a friend you trust no matter where you go. Safe or not, things can happen. You don't want to be changing a tire on Darling road with no one to keep you company. You could give Oxbow itself a call and talk to the owners. It's a quiet little private horse boarding facility (family run, down to earth people who like to party) and they would probably be happy to accommodate you onsite where there is a landline, cell signal, people to keep an eye out for you :) If you offer to throw them a few bucks for the trouble/as a courtesy, I'll bet they would let you lay on a blanket in a beautiful field near the horses for as long as you like. PM me and I'll give ya an address, my name, and their number if you want to do that idea :)   All the best!   p.s. an alternate idea is to say FTW and drive all the way out to north of port huron on the coast and watch from the state park or other private beaches all along Lake Huron. Nothing beats a Michigan freshwater beach for star gazing and it's reallllllly not a long drive for how fun it is.   Also you can just hit up an Observatory.. Cranbrook or Eastern if you have already seen UofM's."

AnnArbor,3av7zs,thenewblxck,7,Tue Jun 23 19:46:03 2015 UTC,"First, I would suggest getting your measurements for a bike. Here is a bike measurement calculator.  Second, take that information and look through Craigslist or Ebay and find a second hand bike to start out on for your first few months/year. You could also check local stores to see if they have previous years models too. Sometimes they do a nice discount on those bikes. But make sure the bike fits! I recommend buying second hand bikes for your first one since cycling is such an expensive sport. Make sure you like it first before investing a ton of money into it. You might start and find out you actually don't like it and then you're not out all the money.  Local shops that I would recommend:   Transition Rack Wheels in Motion Great Lakes Cycling   Also, Fraser Bicycles will be opening up in A2 soon. They bought the old Two Wheel Tango locations.  Strava will help you find local cyclist/routes (I don't use it and just prefer to explore/use my tried and true routes.  Good luck and have fun!"
AnnArbor,3av7zs,polishpanther87,4,Tue Jun 23 19:56:46 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add that no one in town recommends:   Campus Bike Shop   Search in this subreddit for horror stories. From repair quality to employee-management relations, I've never heard anyone say anything positive.  Also, OP, you can walk into any of the shops above, hand over your driver's license, and demo as many of the bikes as you want. They'll generally take as much time as you want to help you find the right bike, and to give you an honest assessment of the tradeoffs. If you balk at a price, they'll find something cheaper. The people that work there are bike geeks first, sales people second (in my experience)."
AnnArbor,3av7zs,andyflip,3,Wed Jun 24 01:08:02 2015 UTC,"This is good info. I'm a novice biker but have two things to add:   I had a great experience at Sic Transit Cycles, the guys in there were awesome. Buying from Craigslist can be super hit and miss. You might pick up something for $100 that seems ridable, then you take it in to get serviced and it needs a new wheel and a new chain and new tires and so on... and by the time you've got it in good shape you're out another $100+. I'm not trying to make any assumptions, but if you're driving an Audi then you may be able to throw down $500 up front for something like the Trek 7.2, which may end up saving you money on repairs and new parts in the long run."
AnnArbor,3av7zs,frank_and_beans,3,Wed Jun 24 00:24:23 2015 UTC,"That's true, buying from Craigslist can be hit or miss. If you have a friend that is big into cycling and knows what to look for makes it easier.   My friend was looking for a bike, found one on Craigslist that matched her measurements and I went with her to check it out. Turned out it did need around $100 worth of fixes so I got the seller to knock off $100 and sited the issues so she could use that money to fix the bike up.  It is possible to find something good there, just make sure you have a knowledgable person with you."
AnnArbor,3av7zs,polishpanther87,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:18:41 2015 UTC,"Would you be interested in helping me? I literally have no friends around here,so I have none into biking obviously.

AnnArbor,3av7zs,polishpanther87,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:40:20 2015 UTC,"I will help you as much as possible. First you need to figure out exactly what you are going to use the bike for. You'll need to answer these questions.   You have said cardio, but does that mean you want to ride on the roads or trails? Would you also use the bike to commute to school or work as well? Are you looking for something that can take a beating and keep going with regular maintenance?  Are you willing to learn some new skills to maintain your bike yourself? I know you said you don't have a ton of money to spend so learning to maintain your bike will save you a ton of money going to the shop every now and then. (ex - strip it down, clean it, build it back up, change tires/tubes and other simple tasks) What is your price range? What are your measurements? How much space do you have to store your bike and gear? (please don't be one of those people who will just leave their bike outside chained to their porch)   If I think of anything else I will let you know."
AnnArbor,3av7zs,andyflip,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:21:58 2015 UTC,"It would probably be roads more often than not. I don't really know..can I do both?  I wouldn't be using it to commute to school(not looking to bike 10 miles one way to class and be all sweaty through class) I'm looking for something rather cheap for starters,as I don't have the money for something top shelf.  I'm very willing to learn how to maintain it if someone can teach me or just point me in the direction of good places online to learn. My price range is honestly like $200-$250 I have no idea what my measurements are? I'm 5'10"" if that helps. It would likely be stored in my apartment."
AnnArbor,3av7zs,notwearingpants,2,Mon Jun 29 02:59:47 2015 UTC,"Anything bought new from a reputable shop is going to be worth the price. Probably for about $300 OP should be able to get a really solid new bike that will last as long as s/he wants it to last. My ""beater commuter"" was about that price point and is now ~10 years old. Get it checked out once a year and it'll last.  Either way though, you should budget something like $50-100 in maintenance a year, just for normal wear and tear. Some years it's just a new set of brakes, some years you need a new cassette and a chain and dangit you popped another tube somehow oh great another broken spoke FML.  But yeah, buy something from CL in a college town and you a) can't guarantee it's not stolen and b) you don't know what quality of parts are on it."

I'm still a broke college student,I just got a great deal on financing because my cosigner has amazing credit. I'm looking to spend about $250 maximum, as I'm mostly doing it because I don't like to run,and I really need some cardio. Also,I'm hoping to meet some people to ride with. So basically,I want something that isn't unpleasant to ride,but I'm also looking to keep the cost pretty modest because I don't come from money,and what money I do have has been very hard-earned."

AnnArbor,3av7zs,GnomeCzar,3,Wed Jun 24 02:04:11 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on where you want to ride and what you want to use it for. I've got this Bianchi iseo  https://9d9bafaa7e1c26449b7f-a5c63574477efb2afde5386885f5023f.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/bike_photos/photos/000/000/359/detail/2013-11-14_17.33.05.jpg I use it for commuting. It's light, 21 speed for climbing hills, the tires are slightly thicker than a road bike so dirt roads and pot holes aren't a problem yet the tires are thinner than a mountain bike so it's easier to pedal.  I put a rack on the back so that I can lash things to it. This bike is the balance between road bike and mountain bike that I find optimal for getting around town. I've also taken it on a couple longer 30 mile trips and it worked well. So really it depends on what kind of biking you have in mind."
AnnArbor,3av7zs,andyflip,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:59:34 2015 UTC,"I mainly have recreational biking in mind,probably more along city streets but possibly some trails? I really don't even know,I just don't have many hobbies anymore and I felt that this could be a really positive one to pick up."
AnnArbor,3av7zs,notwearingpants,2,Wed Jun 24 02:02:01 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you should test the waters like others are saying and see what sort of style you like best.  As far as finding something in your budget, I know my friend just got a decent refurbished bike for about 300 from a bike shop. If you're trying to get in shape, I can recommend you a killer hill to climb haha. Oh and I haven't seen it mentioned yet but if you plan to leave your bike outside at all, budget another $50 or so to get a lock. I'd say get a solid u lock/cable combination. If you rely on just the cable, it's much easier for thieves to snip it and run. I lock the frame with the u and run the cable through the wheels so that someone can't take just my wheels  since they're quick release."
AnnArbor,3av7zs,oogachaka,3,Wed Jun 24 11:21:56 2015 UTC,"What's your budget like? If you are looking for a high quality bike, I would recommend a cyclocross bike. Because the roads are so bad in AA, it's nice to have something that rides mostly like a road bike, but is tougher and has treaded tires. That makes it easier to ride on gravel or dirt roads or over the massive potholes you will inevitably hit."
AnnArbor,3av7zs,oogachaka,2,Tue Jun 23 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"Seconded. Cyclocross bikes and touring bikes are hybrids done ""the right way."" Nice aerodynamic posture (drop bars and geometry), sturdy, and... just cooler than hybrids done the ""wrong way"" (i.e. anything that comes with a gel seat & upright posture).  I'm in the Surly Cross Check cult. It's lowish priced for a ""bike store bike"" (certainly the cheapest cyclocross bike you'd find... although no serious CXers would race it). I'd also look at the Jamis Aurora or the Trek 520  All three bikes would be practical, comfortable, and don't scream out that you're trying to be a lycra-clad pro.  Also, if you want to ride there are lots of groups on meetup and you could PM me.  edit: found a maybe? cheaper cross bike: http://www.konaworld.com/jake.cfm"

What is amazing to me is how often senior housing has only 5-10% of the units earmarked as accessible. I would expect that many seniors would need help getting around at some point.

I'm not one to take cover right when a warning is issued, but mom is. So we go to the basement and see put the weather channel on, and the perfect storm and circulation was supposed to go right over our house.  Luckily it missed us by a good margin, but I remember having school called off (it was my senior year at DHS) and going into town. There was insulation in trees all over. It's weird seeing the destruction of a tornado at ground level. From the helicopter is just looks like a mashup of colors, but in real life -- it's clothes, wood, drywall, paint, ect."

AnnArbor,3astqp,chriswaco,3,Tue Jun 23 06:30:24 2015 UTC,Yeah. The guy on the news said something like they confirmed spotting one. My judgement at 1 was not at peak.
AnnArbor,3astqp,treycook,5,Tue Jun 23 12:56:58 2015 UTC,"NWS confirmed one at like 1:50am, as your title says. But it was probably just the rotation they picked up and made a conservative statement to get people to be extra cautious."

AnnArbor,3anvs3,MrThrowaway109,14,Mon Jun 22 01:30:07 2015 UTC,I feel like making/using colors reflecting one of the high schools in town is awkward somehow. Maybe because I'm a townie in the sense of born and raised vs. moving in during college/adulthood. But definitely River Rats was my first thought.
AnnArbor,3anvs3,girlwithabird-,3,Mon Jun 22 04:28:10 2015 UTC,"I understand.  However, with three traditional high schools and three alternative high schools, you'd be hard-pressed to not use the colors from at least one of them.      The colors weren't taken from Huron in any event, but rather selected on their own merit.  Huron's ""official"" colors are a forest green and old gold, which are quite different from this.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huron_High_School_%28Ann_Arbor,_Michigan%29      It is actually kind of nice that the flag is reminiscent of one of the schools at least, in my opinion.  Also, I didn't opt for maize and blue because Ann Arbor is more than just the University of Michigan, and should have its own color palette."

AnnArbor,3anvs3,Xelath,3,Mon Jun 22 07:17:57 2015 UTC,"Description:  A green field in the background reflects the ""arbor"" motif for Ann Arbor with its verdant landscapes, and keeps the three yellow stripes from the current flag. However, the pale yellow of the current stripes is now instead maize in a nod to the University of Michigan. The top and bottom yellow stripes stand for Ann Allen and Ann Rumsey (the two Anns for which Ann Arbor was named) and the middle yellow stripe represents the Huron River, which flows through the city.   Alongside the stripes are two triangle shapes meant to evoke the double A's in the city's name, as well as symbolize forward progress, Ann Arbor being famous for innovation.   The placement of maize over green is also a subtle statement of its own. ;)  The original thread on /r/vexillology can be found here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/3amr7e/a_flag_for_ann_arbor_mi/"

You can also park in the lot visible from Huron St. and walk into the park. I could not find a website but just google it and you'll find more info.
