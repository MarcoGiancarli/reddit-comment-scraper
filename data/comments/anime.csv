anime,3e2xjv,Kahandran,29,Tue Jul 21 18:09:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely the most interesting character this season for me even more so than Yuki from Gakkou Gurashi. His character design so far is just great. A competent hardcore gamer with great leadership skills who finds himself having to act as an ""evil"" Overlord who is both benevolent and merciless to his enemies. However he slowly comes to realise that instead of just purely playing the part, he somewhat already is the character.   Perhaps its because the character's (Momonga) traits are becoming his own or that he had been roleplaying as Momonga for years when it was all just a game that even when the villagers and knights are dying he defaults to that mind state thinking that they're all just NPCs in truth."

Dude has to maintain a balance between his fading humanity, his own empathy, feeling of duty towards his old teammate, and images of both the benevolent ruler and scary spooky skeleton lord! I love it.  And Albedo looks great in that, surprisingly not sexualized, armor.   P.S. I have question though. So, does the guy who plays Momonga always online? Is he stuck in the game? Does he log off to get some sleep or food? Or is that a spoiler territory?"

anime,3e2xjv,Thebubumc,28,Tue Jul 21 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"From the looks of it, he got absorbed Tron-style, but instead of going to the world of the game, he went into a different world altogether.

anime,3e2xjv,McSnazzyPants,5,Tue Jul 21 16:45:40 2015 UTC,Ah I  was wondering whether I misremembered how it looked in the manga.
anime,3e2xjv,Telinary,6,Tue Jul 21 17:01:56 2015 UTC,I kind of prefer the anime approach. Unless there is an important reason she wanted to look anonymous. I like the idea of Albedo in her personally fit armor. Fits her penchant for flair.

We learn more about the world Momonga, now Ainz, lives in now. And can I just say, seems like some of the inhabitants of the world are assholes, destroying innocent villages just to lure out one person. For that reason, I don't even feel a tinny bit bad that the death knight Ainz summoned went to town of their asses. They deserved it. Madhouse not censoring it made it so much better.  I liked seeing how Ainz saved the village not out of the goodness of his heart but because Sebas reminded him of his old friend, and apparently his hero, Touch Me. Shows the level of apathy towards humans that being an undead lich has began to cause.   Next episode looks like the people chasing Gazef are about to make an appearance in the village whiles Ainz is there. I sure hope they do nothing to irritate him. Who are I kidding? I'd love to see him go to town on the asses of anyone who pisses him off."

Can a LN reader tell me what the main focus will be? Fights, character development, maybe Romance?, something else? It's kinda difficult for me to picture the direction this anime will take  Edit: Thanks for the answers guys! Looks promising."
anime,3e2xjv,Myllis,19,Tue Jul 21 16:19:21 2015 UTC,"There are some fights, quite a bit of character development. It mostly centers around how Nazarick and Ainz goes around to live in this new world. So.. Character and world development?  A good comparison would be Log Horizon, if you have seen that. With less humor and more serious."

There's going to be fights and a lot of character development, there is not a lot of romance. TBH, I'm hyped to see something else than your standard loli/harem/SAO-clone-cliché. The whole Introduction with the D-MMORPG just seemed to be a introduction to throw you into the world."

anime,3e2xjv,JustifiedBlade,12,Tue Jul 21 17:38:39 2015 UTC,This right here is potentially in my top five for this season. Could even by AOTS.
anime,3e2xjv,Mitrospeed,11,Tue Jul 21 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"Now this amount of blood and violence in ""Gate"" and I could die happily. Well done Overlord, well done Madhouse"
anime,3e2xjv,PonKatt,12,Tue Jul 21 16:28:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I think this answered the question of whether they would be censoring or not.  I for one love the amount of gore."
anime,3e2xjv,squidthesid,9,Tue Jul 21 16:22:23 2015 UTC,"I've definitely been enjoying Overlord, it's one of my favorite anime takes on ""MMO players trapped in a fantasy world"" so far (compared to Log Horizon and SAO).  As for the episode, I really enjoyed how Momoga annihilated the knights without even breaking a sweat (do liches even sweat?). Seeing the death knight slaughter those enemy knights was also very satisfying as well. Kind of reminds me of how the minor GATE spoilers  I also very much enjoyed learning about some of the intricacies of the world (such as the political conflicts between the three nations, the currencies of the world, and adventurers), even if it wasn't conveyed in the most brilliant of ways (i.e. exposition dump). Based on what I've seen in this episode and the previous episodes, it wouldn't be too far off to assume that we'll get some more substantial world-building in the next few episodes.    Plus, we also got to see more of best girl (albeit in armor), so overall, a really solid episode."
anime,3e2xjv,LtKill,10,Tue Jul 21 16:32:21 2015 UTC,"Albedo is such a loose cannon, it's hilarious.   Belius's death comes off as a bit more justice-porny. The reason being:   Because of his lechery, Belius tried to rape one of the village girls and clashed with her father who tried to save her. After they pulled the man away, Belius vented his anger on him by repeatedly thrusting his sword into the villager —— he was that kind of person. The only reason he was able to join this force was because of the gold of his family, which was wealthy and owned many estates in the country.   This show was one of only two series that I just HAD to read the source material for as the anime was airing and I have to say, I am 100% in love with the series."
anime,3e2xjv,Stendarpaval,8,Tue Jul 21 17:02:18 2015 UTC,"The anime is doing a superb job on pacing the story. I figured much more could happen in a single episode, but I'm glad this means that I'll get to enjoy the show for that much longer. Next episode's going to be great!"
anime,3e2xjv,Dazbuzz,9,Tue Jul 21 16:22:45 2015 UTC,"So glad this series is living up to my expectations so far. Albedo looks great in armor. That red mask looks silly though.  Nice to see the fighting was brutal and uncensored. Repeatedly stabbing that one knight... jeez. Also seems like MC isnt going to be some justice warrior either, which is a nice change.  The OP/ED are quite catchy."
anime,3e2xjv,Kentngo,10,Tue Jul 21 16:40:10 2015 UTC,Also seems like MC isnt going to be some justice warrior either   How about a spinoff with Touch Me as the Main Character?
anime,3e2xjv,tomolone,3,Tue Jul 21 16:59:53 2015 UTC,10/10 would watch.
anime,3e2xjv,cowin13,3,Tue Jul 21 17:58:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I am very happy with there being no censorship. Too many shows that are built around death/gore apply censorship to their show and it usually ruins the feel of it quite a bit. Good to see that someone is at least listening to complaints. + This is one of the few shows the past few seasons that I've seen that isn't censored.
anime,3e2xjv,oblivionraptor,8,Tue Jul 21 17:07:34 2015 UTC,"What? That's all!? Come on!   Felt like 10 minutes of based Mr. Skeltal doing what he does best.   That scene where the soldier was being repeatedly stabbed, the subtitles were truly amazing. Incoherent gibberish being spewed from your blood-filled mouth, the subs did well to increase the hype that I felt.  That's it, gotta pick up the source material after Overlord has finished airing. And then rewatch it again."
anime,3e2xjv,ohgodthedonuts,7,Tue Jul 21 16:58:00 2015 UTC,I really like this show so far. It scratches an itch that I didn't even know existed for me. But what interests me is how MC will develop as a character. He talks about his fading humanity and that makes me wonder if he will eventually tip over into the evil side.

Also, I love the little moments that demonstrate Monmonga's lack of empathy; like when you see the girl he's setting out to rescue gets cut across the back and he just keeps on talking, doesn't miss a beat."
anime,3e2xjv,dnLoL,3,Tue Jul 21 17:22:24 2015 UTC,Oh man i love this anime. For me its probably the best anime this season.

anime,3e2xjv,xypers,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:56 2015 UTC,is the summon supposed to be that huge?
anime,3e2xjv,azriel777,7,Tue Jul 21 16:15:14 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, but I want that spell used in a game damn it.  Turning measly corpses into a super tall killing machine death knights would be awesome.  Oh, and whoever the death knight kills comes back as a zombie minions of the death night."
anime,3e2xjv,Inu_kyubi,6,Tue Jul 21 16:42:32 2015 UTC,"In the game the summon was supposed to be relatively low level, and usefull only because of it's high defenses and ability to attract enemy attacks"
anime,3e2xjv,Bradyhaha,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:10 2015 UTC,"I hope Momonga gets a chance to meet with the king while keeping his mask on.    I wonder why he started off with such a high level spell though. His aura of hopelessness  (and panty soaking) and a low level area of effect attack spell would have proffered him more information.   Finally, I hope he takes all off the attacking knights captive to experiment on.  That has potential for entertainment for Skele-kun."
anime,3e2xjv,a_german_guy,15,Tue Jul 21 16:36:04 2015 UTC,"I wonder why he started off with such a high level spell though.    He assumed they were his level, maybe higher. There's no way to check without actually fighting them, so he started strong and cast weaker spells after that. The lightning spell was supposed to stun the guy, IIRC"
anime,3e2xjv,Bradyhaha,4,Tue Jul 21 16:45:29 2015 UTC,"I figured with how quick it was to cast his heart crushing spell he could have pulled that out at any time.  His caution is one of the reasons I like him anyway, so it makes sense."
anime,3e2xjv,thewataru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:04 2015 UTC,Is that heart spell explained in LN or manga? Seems like some kind-of targeted insta-kill spell. Is it expensive in mana or has long cooldown? Such spell seems very OP in any MMORPG.
anime,3e2xjv,a_german_guy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:05:53 2015 UTC,"Not to my knowledge. However, that spell was 9th Tier, the highest is 10th Tier and there are apparently some Spells that go beyond that. So it cost probably some mana. Mana-wise, Ainz has a fuckload of MP, so I don't believe that it made a huge dent. Can't say for sure though."
anime,3e2xjv,Inu_kyubi,4,Tue Jul 21 18:13:32 2015 UTC,"He didn't know if his spells would be usefull at all in them, so he started with somthing powerfull. Seeing that worked, he lowered the level and used a weaker spell instead"

anime,3e2xjv,ElecNinja,3,Tue Jul 21 16:52:37 2015 UTC,Just don't think of it like Log Horizon or SAO.  It's definitely it's own beast that gives off a vastly different feel.

anime,3e35m0,LouisLeGros,9,Tue Jul 21 16:59:05 2015 UTC,Don't bother with Centaur's Worries imo. The beginning chapters were alright but after awhile it literally turned into the mad ravings of someone higher than Snoop Lion.   12Beast is bi-monthly and really hasn't gone anywhere interesting yet.  Dr. Hitomi is full of puns and is generally okay. Except for the fact her breasts get bigger with every issue. I shit you not.  I'd recommend looking up Monstergirl Encyclopedia prior to MGQ simply because it's more palatable.   There's also T-Rex na Kanojo and Killing Bites. The former's cute dumb dino and the latter's more gore-y.

Sure jokes here and there, and such. But the Anime threat them with their Respect their need. Okay, in this Show there is also some kind of to love RU hidden.  I like this Show"

We all can clearly see that his life is not easy - so most of the time he is more in an ""endurance"" mode. (You know, in order to survive all the stuff thrown at him.) But when he gets serious he snaps back and shows his normal face.  So instead of having a character that brushes back his hair or throws away his weighted training clothes to get into ""serious mode"" we have a character that just usually tones it down a level or two. I think it fits his at times borderline stoic character."

His physical endurance is god-like... I think the girls would be in more danger than him should they ever have sex. All three of them will panting for him to stop before his stamina even drops noticably...

anime,3dzsd8,archaicScrivener,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:54 2015 UTC,"Imho the reason S2 was ""worse"" than S1 is because S1 had Makishima (motherfucking) Shougo, who was quite possibly the most perfect villain I've ever seen. You just can't get better than him in any regard, and so Kamui, in season 2, just seemed very boring and contrived.  Just my 2 cents tho, which probably won't apply to many people since I can't imagine my zealotry for Makishima will be shared by many :P"

anime,3dzsd8,bigfoot1291,59,Mon Jul 20 22:54:38 2015 UTC,Was Psycho Pass season 2 worth watching? I really enjoyed S1 but never got around to the second season.
anime,3dzsd8,Rexcalibur,109,Mon Jul 20 22:01:19 2015 UTC,"Yes. Not quite on the same level as s1 but I have found most of the hate comes simply from the fact that there isn't Kogami, which is a pretty unacceptable claim if you ask me."
anime,3dzsd8,bigfoot1291,102,Mon Jul 20 22:07:04 2015 UTC,"There's more to it than that. The main villain is essentially a weaker version of Makishima with a gimmick that doesn't really make sense, the new side characters are pretty bad, Ginoza's character development is shafted, the literary references are even more forced than the original, the ending is a trainwreck that leaves the viewer with a uncompletely obtuse take-home message, and, most importantly, it doesn't add anything new. The story progresses very much in the same way that Pyscho Pass 1 did, but worse.  The first several episodes are fun because you get to see Tsunemori's character development and more of the universe, but it soon becomes clear that its macro-level storytelling is severely lacking."
anime,3dzsd8,Exadra,42,Tue Jul 21 00:00:01 2015 UTC,"I kind of disagree with the claim that the story is the same from season 1 and didn't add anything new.  The central theme of season 1 is  whereas the central theme of season 2 is a completely different issue of   You'll find no argument from me that the end was messy, I'm assuming (hoping) the movie resolves that, as I've heard numerous times that s2 is a setup for the movie."
anime,3dzsd8,boringoldcookie,21,Tue Jul 21 00:11:00 2015 UTC,The issue is that both of the themes that you've listed were already covered in season 1.  What you've listed as s1's theme only drove the first half of s1 while the second half followed what you have as s2's theme.
anime,3dzsd8,teerre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:52:10 2015 UTC,So far we've gotten absolutely no resolution in my opinion.
anime,3dzsd8,t337c213,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:53:32 2015 UTC,What you guys think it's messy about the end?  I thought it was pretty straight forward
anime,3dzsd8,blacksheep998,9,Tue Jul 21 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"yeah. I agree, and I think it mostly stems from the difference in tone (S01 has the feel of a thriller, with police developing a case, similar to Monster, GitS:SAC, or Death Note. S02 has an action tone, more child like except for the literary references they jam down your throat.)"
anime,3dzsd8,apez1267,6,Tue Jul 21 00:45:54 2015 UTC,"All those are valid complaints, but what I thought was the weakest in S2 was Tsunemori herself.  I get that the whole premise of her character is that she's supernaturally stable, but they took it to unbelievable levels. With the stuff she went through in S2 she might have been still able to barely hold herself together, but she was totally calm and rational, never even lost her temper."
anime,3dzsd8,zaturama015,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:11:02 2015 UTC,"In the final Ep of s2, they basically said she was crazy and thus invited her to join them. In response, she agreed with them and said she would when she was no longer able to continue in her human body."
anime,3dzsd8,shadedclan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:53 2015 UTC,The movie is already ready for DL
anime,3dzsd8,metigue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:31:26 2015 UTC,I think you're right. Hell the final few episodes mimicked the last few episodes of season 1 as well. It didn't really add anything to the story but it was really interesting to see how fucked up that universe can be. It felt more like a CSI show wherein there were a lot of different instances that we see how Sybil and the universe itself would handle things
anime,3dzsd8,birdreligion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:04:58 2015 UTC,"This. So much this. Ramping up to the end of season 1 I was hella excited- Makashima was such a good villain, the Sybyl system was nice and mysterious- Kogami, Akane. It had so much potential that they just threw away. I rate that show a 9 until the lat 2 episodes where it drops to a 7."
anime,3dzsd8,korrupt-wolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:03 2015 UTC,"The 3-4 episodes leading to the finale were so good. Great build, you just knew something epic was in store, and then it ends.  And you're just like.... oh.... thats... all...?  It wasn't a bad ending, it was just disapointing."
anime,3dzsd8,aop42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:31:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly. S2 wasn't too bad. But S1 was just so fucking phenomenal that I think people expected the same or even better for another season, which of course didn't happen. Sadly. I wanted it to be as awesome as the first."
anime,3dzsd8,SinnermightyBL,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:40:01 2015 UTC,"I think the charecterization was always the weakest points anyway. I only saw S1 but in there the only charachters who were complicated were the main villain, and the anti-hero good guy. Everyone else seemed like flat archetypes. What made me keep watching was the world that it was set in, its cool concepts, and its high production values. It was a good watch. Just not that strong characters."
anime,3dzsd8,JThoms,13,Tue Jul 21 04:59:38 2015 UTC,"It sets up the movie by introducing a few characters that are in there. Not mandatory, but it's a quick watch."

anime,3dzsd8,birdreligion,5,Mon Jul 20 22:50:43 2015 UTC,"hah, thanks for the info. I'm not as in the loop as I used to be so these things fly by me usually without you all."

anime,3dzsd8,Blindbandit809,4,Tue Jul 21 02:31:58 2015 UTC,"IMO I liked the first season a lot more then the second, but its still worth watching"
anime,3dzsd8,Nayyyyy,16,Mon Jul 20 23:03:10 2015 UTC,"It's still very good. it has the same feel even though IMO the writings a little worse. (Gen URobutcher didn't write, he did supervise and edit though) definitely sill worth a watch."
anime,3dzsd8,SGKurisu,8,Mon Jul 20 22:03:59 2015 UTC,"Currently watching S2 after S1.   It's still good, just pales in comparison really. It's only 11 episodes so it's a quick watch. I'll probably be finishing it in like 1 hour."
anime,3dzsd8,shimyia,4,Mon Jul 20 22:12:54 2015 UTC,"The plot isn't nearly as brilliant as the first season, but it still is worth watching if you enjoy the setting and overall ideas the first had. What really got me engaged in psycho pass personally was the setting and the idea of crime coefficients, neither of which change in the sequel so I enjoyed it a lot. The lack of Kogami and Makishima are really what people dislike about the second season the most, which is understandable since those two characters were brilliant."
anime,3dzsd8,hyugafan,2,Tue Jul 21 00:18:16 2015 UTC,Don't. Just wait for the movie to get a subbed DVD release.  The second season breaks too many pre-established rules of the series. It's all just made to look kinda cool. But it's really not.
anime,3dzsd8,Ryuujinx,3,Tue Jul 21 16:18:12 2015 UTC,"If you want more of kogami and his awesome dynamic, then no. You do get to watch ""innocent little japanese officer"" become ""judge Dredd"". So there's that, and Urobuchi's writing is still top notch. watch it, it's worth it if you like the world building/universe."
anime,3dzsd8,DashAttack,8,Tue Jul 21 00:25:08 2015 UTC,"Urobuchi's writing is still top notch.   It's funny, because he didn't write S2.   http://myanimelist.net/anime/23281/Psycho-Pass_2/characters  He was there for 'planning', which I'm not sure what part that actually played. Storyboarding or something? I dunno. The movie is written by him though."
anime,3dzsd8,MeteoraGB,4,Tue Jul 21 03:46:08 2015 UTC,"Personally, I didn't think it was worth it. I'm sure others disagree, but something about the pacing (and the story/writing in general) felt off, and I didn't care for the new characters (protagonists and antagonists both)."
anime,3dzsd8,Telinary,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:01:35 2015 UTC,"Its worth watching. As a big fan of the first Psycho-Pass season the second one is definitely weaker and a bigger disappointment, but I really enjoyed watching it at the time. Just don't set your hopes too high for the second season.  Oh and get ready to hate the second season's justice bitch."
anime,3dzsd8,Ashuvain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:50:32 2015 UTC,I'm reading some anime blog and it was funny watching how during the run of season two the posts about it became steadily more negative.^ But I would just try it.

anime,3dzsd8,st_griffith,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:40:39 2015 UTC,I'm watching it right now (it's literally on pause) and it isn't as good but definitely worth watching. (So far)

anime,3dzsd8,spacklez,8,Mon Jul 20 22:36:05 2015 UTC,Why don't people ever stop comparing Ghost In The Shell and Psycho-pass while they differ on so many aspects ?
anime,3dzsd8,jyeJ,-11,Mon Jul 20 22:42:53 2015 UTC,"...why wouldn't you compare them? they're really really similar in a lot of aspects and also ""Psycho-Pass originated from Production I.G.'s interest in making a successor to Mamoru Oshii's achievements""  and i love psycho-pass, im not saying its bad for being similar to ghost in the shell, the second season was just crap"
anime,3dzsd8,spacklez,5,Mon Jul 20 22:56:10 2015 UTC,"They certainly share similarities as GitS is one of the major milestone of the medium, but they also share them with countless other dystopians sci-fi works.

anime,3dzsd8,0mnicious,5,Tue Jul 21 00:14:46 2015 UTC,"but it's not apparently voice activated according to an engadget article (assuming the translation can be trusted) there is a camera in the muzzle and the gun pairs up with your smartphone.  it has an app that does a bunch of nifty stuff including: reading the ""crime coefficient"" of the person you point it at and reacting accordingly  which is so much more badass than voice control"

For me, meeting some of the famous cosplayers and voice actors is always my favorite part. I also go with my anime friends so we can explore together and make it a really expensive hangout day.  Conventions have a different culture, in my opinion. Everyone there loves anime and manga, so you know you aren't going to be judged for liking it. Because of that, some people go over the top, but in my experience, convention people are really cool if you go in with an open mind. The horror stories I heard circa 2008 are mostly eradicated because people have realized that there are limits to having fun, like not physically assaulting people with your love or sexually harassing cosplayers."

Anyways, I still wore that headband around my neck every day until we fell out of touch. I now have a school picture that makes me cringe every time I look at it."

anime,3e2eet,SupremeChun,13,Tue Jul 21 13:13:22 2015 UTC,"Sound is good. It fits perfectly, but besides the opening there are few times where it is memorable.  The editing is fantastic. It is not fast paced (at least yet), but they make a really good job at making you care about the characters. Since things are going down the drain ( Thats pretty obvious from EP.... uhhh... some episodes ago, the pager message ) It is very important that you care about the characters, otherwise it doesn't have any impact. EP1 however was a bust, I almost gave up on it at that point because it made very little sense, but from Ep2 and onwards, when you start to understand the environment things start getting interesting.  Art style - well, not my cup of tea. I don't actively dislike it, but its not one of my favorites. Yes, it is very well drawn, just not on my favorites. Animation however is pretty great."
anime,3e2eet,_Pleinair_,10,Tue Jul 21 13:26:34 2015 UTC,I actually recommend rewatching episode 1 after you finish the series. Or leave it to a full series rewatch much later on.

He was episode director for Gundam Reconquista EP10 and that one looked really good compared to the previous 9 episodes.   His stuff often earns mainstream popularity like Attack on Titan and Death Note.   There's a new anime coming up directed by him and animated by the AoT team iirc.

Death Note's animation quality is kind of close to HOTD's but it is a bit more inconsistent as the show progresses. Btooom is average, nothing special. No Game No Life looks pretty but the animation quality only stands out in the first episode and the last two. Parasyte's animation quality is inconsistent after the first 6-10 episodes.  For clarity, animation quality (to me) = how well things are animated (smoothness, consistency with previous frames, etc.), not how pretty the art style is.  So now I have to ask,  what shows do you think are standards for amazing ""visuals?"""
anime,3e2o3n,BP_Ray,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:42:12 2015 UTC,"So now I have to ask, what shows do you think are standards for amazing ""visuals?""   Just in general, I look at Kyoani as an all around good studio when it comes to good looking shows, even when they don't work on SoL shows. They make fantastic looking scenery, really neat effects with relatively smooth animation, amazing attention to detail (Not the best example, couldn't find light refraction water bottle screenshot for some reason), and nice use of color. This is why Kyoani is one of my favorite studios.  You also brought up Unlimited Budget Works, and that is also amazing to me because it has the best special effects i've seen in an anime and they use them constantly in the show, great scenery, and theres never a moment where nothing is happening on screen because of all the nice effects they make use of even in still shots, like dust particles in the light. It's not the best thing ever, and I don't consider ufotable as consistently amazing as Kyoani, but they're definitely one of the best in my opinion."
anime,3e2o3n,Spectre_Assassin,0,Tue Jul 21 16:09:12 2015 UTC,"Just in general, I look at Kyoani as an all around good studio when it comes to good looking shows   I also agree. Keep in mind that HOTD isn't the only show I use as a standard for great animation quality (although I much prefer the art styles and ""visuals"" of Kyoani works).  As for UBW, the anime looks very nice because of the special effects but I don't think the animation quality is that great. The first cour's animation quality was excellent but the second cour suffers for being inconsistent (which is something people rarely bring up when discussing the anime)."
anime,3e2o3n,schglobbs,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:01 2015 UTC,"I agree that UBW was inconsistent in the second cour, I heard that they apparently ran into issues so even around march they were still working on the UBW which should tell you something about how badly that fucked them.

The idea that she's just a spectator in her own show is an easy mistake to make but it's totally totally wrong.  Madoka Magica isn't a show about what the characters do, it's about their emotional journey. Everyone recognizes Sayaka's story is compelling not because of anything she actually does but because of how she emotionally reacts. People know that Homura's journey from weak to strong in Episode 10 is what makes that episode so great.   It's the same for Madoka: she does do a lot of sitting around listening to other characters, but she's not doing nothing. The show is about her emotional journey. The Madoka that the show starts with is a completely different character than it ends with, moreso than any of the other characters."

That's right, I'm talking about KIRYUIN SATSUKI!!!, whose name must always be used in full, typed in capitals with multiple exclamation marks, and when spoken must be screamed at the top of your voice.   Now I know what you're thinking. How can she be best girl when she's, well, a perpetually frowning caterpillar eyebrowed bitch? She's not cute or moe, she's not a God or anything supernatural, and she's certainly not a fawning harem member. Well then, read on!  What does it take to be a best girl? Why, of course, you must be the best at everything! Leadership! Charisma! Beauty! Strength! Determination! Intelligence! Planning! This girl has got it all in spades, and there's a very good reason that everyone who meets her is both metaphorically and literally dazzled with bright lights. If there was ever a good role model for a strong girl in anime, it would be KIRYUIN SATSUKI!!!   Her followers are willing to serve her to the death, and the show doesn’t just throw this at you – they show how she recruited all her main supporters and why they love her.  Her beauty is so dazzling that she literally emanates light wherever she goes, causing nosebleeds in her underlings. She has such strong willpower that she can control a full Kamui as a normal human being while others can’t even handle 50%. She’s the strongest human around, dangerously intelligent and unpredictable, and she always has something up her sleeve even when she’s outnumbered and outpowered by all these supernatural beings. So many shows equate strong and determined with swearing, bitchiness, violence and sass. Either that or go completely the other way, cold, emotionless and manipulative. Satsuki shows that you can have elements of all this, but the true marker of a strong character is someone who sets their goals and does everything they need to achieve it, no more or less. Even her taunting of Ryuko served a purpose. Ruthless with good reason, manipulative when necessary, yet still close with the people she trusts and willing to admit her mistakes when they appear.   This is the greatest quote from any female anime character ever ““Exhibitionist? Nonsense! … The fact that you are embarrassed by the values of the masses only proves how small you are! If it means fulfilling her ambitions Satsuki Kiryuin will show neither shame nor hesitation, even if she bares her breasts for all the world to see! My actions are utterly pure!” That’s her message to everyone complaining about the nudity in the show.   That’s not to say she never fails. But she never gives up. She sets her goals, knows exactly what she needs to achieve it, never wavers from achieving that even in the face of impossible odds and extreme adversity, and yet is flexible enough to change her methods when that becomes necessary. And, perhaps most amazingly of all,  OVA Spoilers.  Oh and of course, there’s this smile. And if you really need the cute moe loli side…  That, my friends, is why KIRYUIN SATSUKI!!! deserves your votes, and your devotion. Vote now for KIRYUIN SATSUKI!!!"

anime,3e1xlt,Nate-senpai,3,Tue Jul 21 16:21:23 2015 UTC,And if you still like this style of Anime your next stop would be Space Dandy.  Edit: I meant Watanabes style of an episodic anime which he does a lot.
anime,3e1xlt,DaftGorilla,4,Tue Jul 21 15:18:04 2015 UTC,"Not really. A lot of people recommend Space Dandy and Kids on the Slope because of Watanabe's directing, but he's really never done anything like Bebop or Champloo since."
anime,3e1xlt,multiusedrone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not quite the same, but I'd personally highly recommend Space Dandy. Plot-wise there's really not much to it, but it's really entertaining and the cast is great. Additionally, since there are so many different guest directors who have made episodes for it, it's a bit like animation porn because you get to see the same cast animated differently and put into some very different scenarios each time.  For instance, my favorite episode would have to be Episode 21/2.8, A World With No Sadness, Baby, which is entirely unlike any of the other episodes in the show. But a lot of them are really unique like that, and that's one of the main appeals of the show.  I'd love to see it continue with a third season, bring in even more guest directors and animators to do Space Dandy in their own way, and really turn it into an animation showcase."
anime,3e1xlt,Proditus,4,Tue Jul 21 18:11:09 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely recommend Space Dandy after Samurai Champloo.  Not the same style, per se, but it's got some goofy similarities.  Space Dandy is definitely an outside-the-box anime with a great soundtrack, off-the-wall characters, crazy art style and art direction that tends to change for random episodes, and... Well... Boobies.  Don't expect some view-altering epiphany after watching it, but it's definitely a really fun series.  Enjoy it!"

Good to see Nana O settling down a little in her angst regarding Ren.  ""'Cuz I love him.  It's that simple.""  Right!  Surprising amount of conversation spent on the strawberry glasses!  And Nana O learns first-hand the importance of backups, especially when you have weird blackout episodes.  ""Hachiko's got morning sickness and it's raining.  I'm sure she'll be home.""  Not to mention she seems more or less confined to the castle keep at this point, one way or another.  Ughhhh that paparazzo's voice!  (In the dub!)  Who is that guy, it's driving me nuts!  Geez, Nana K is already using Takumi's name.  And so much for the theory about her being in.  Really taking precautions against visitors — precautions that building is pretty advanced to be providing.  Yes, our front desk guy is a consummate actor!  But Nana O sees though it, bless her quasi-boyfriend soul.  Gotta admit, Shin's blunt advice sounds like the actual right course of action to me.  But, that ""I wish I'd been born as your child"" seems to come right out of his amazing ability to say exactly the most affecting thing.  Ooof.  Sounds like Shin's mom had an affair and offed herself out of shame.  And that's why we get dad being so cold to him.  Haha, Trapnest being described as ""goody-goody"".  And our editor friend seems to be firmly in the anti-Takumi camp (like many here).  So Nana O waited there all day, yet Nana K didn't do anything but meet with Shin.  Guess they talked longer than it looked like.  But this ""passing by behind Nana O's back, thus missing her"" is getting to be a habit!  Funny how Nana K's now falling right into the pattern that allows Shin to do what he does, and how he gets this across to her directly, even giving advice for avoiding it.  Again, hooker with a heart of gold.  Sudden media spotlight.  Shin:  shocked.  Nobu:  shocked.  Nana K:  shocked.  Yasu:  pissed."

That's about it this episode."

anime,3e2hd3,AmethystItalian,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"There isn't much to say about this episode. As a matter of fact, this is more of a breather, the silence before the storm. Because nothing actually happens.  Nana O gets herself together, but misses Hachi through a rare case of plot convenience, something that still irks me. The show just doesn't need it and practically never resorts to these kinds of cheap tension tricks, but for some reason they are implemented here.  In any case, the reason for her missing Hachi is because of a talk the latter had with Shin. After being unusually solid last episode, Hachi can't get a streak going. Shin is talking sense here and Hachi just barely offers a rebuttal and a really weak one at that (accepting weaknesses... come on, really?). Furthermore, she tries to get some clues out of Shin as to avoid her child becoming like Shin in the future.   Well guess what? It won't turn out that way. Because the answer to your questions is the same as your rebuttal should have been: you actually want the child. You want to raise it, you want to be a mother, unlike Shin's. All your actions of the past few days have pointed towards that. You've chosen a hard road, but at least it requires conviction.   So don't you dare doubt yourself now, Hachi. Your choice may not be the right one, but you've followed through enough that it's too late to look back. There are legitimate reasons to abandon the path you've chosen, but this is not one of them.   And that's it. Among the drama of past episodes we've still been setting the stage for another bomb: today the fuse has been lit. Now we have to wait for the bang... and deal with the fallout."

It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and one of the only movies to ever make me cry real tears.  I attribute this to the fact that it was such a wake up call for me.  It reminded me what the important things in life were, and how grateful I should really be for the family that I have.  Also, I have to say that some of the cinematography by Hosoda was absolutely stunning.  The scene that follows Ami and Yuki's school life with a single panning shot and the scene in the snowy woods were both breathtaking in their own right."

Of course, the cinematography was excellent, but I think the movies he's written the stories for I appreciated a bit more than say The Girl Who Leapt Through Time because of his emphasis on the themes about family.   The notion of sacrifice out of familial love is not only something that is something that's understandable but the way it's presented seems so natural. There's a Kpop song from the 90s by G.O.D called 어머님께 that I'm particularly fond of that the whole movie reminded me of for those that know what I'm talking about. I also very much appreciated the other themes of letting go and just the general presentation in pretty much every aspect.  Very much looking forward to Bakemono no Ko"

I don't think that the narrative is constructed well enough to make her main character believable or multidimensional in spite of we having to empathize with her. It doesn't come together well as a character study, which harms the film thematically as well.  Also, I do not like this tendency of more films becoming Ghibli-esque (which is not exclusive to Wolf Children, but whatever).  But it is perfectly fine if you loved it! Cool that it serves a gateway for the medium. Hopefully you will watch more japanese animated films."
anime,3e1csh,roflkimchi,3,Tue Jul 21 07:15:04 2015 UTC,"It was a movie about family but Ame becomes emotionally distant and ends up abandoning his family just to explore his wolf side.    While I agree that Ame was an annoying, selfish bastard, I think that his choice at the end of the movie made a lot of sense with regards to the themes of the movie overall.  Wolf Children is not only about family, but also about growing up, and how growing up in turn affects the family (That's why it covered so long of a period of time).  People move apart.  People find their own paths.  Most children are selfish, and look for their own happiness instead of their mother's, hurting and terrifying them in the process.  However, that's just the way life works: We aren't always going to be tethered to our mothers, and life needs to go on.  But sometimes, this is ok.  For a lot of mothers, their children's happiness is their own happiness.  I felt like Ame's choice as well as Hana's reaction to this choice perfectly mirrored this situation and led to a satisfying, albeit bittersweet, conclusion to the themes that were explored throughout the movie."
anime,3e1csh,roflkimchi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah as I said earlier, I agree that Ame was a prick about it.

anime,3e1csh,Fangzzz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:19 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think it actually elevates Hosada's writing, that in his stories good people can do awful things to each other. It would be too cheap to allow a resolution at the end that avoids pain, and Ame's desire to leave the human world behind is in the end irreconcilable with remaining with his mother."
anime,3e1csh,CakeBoss16,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:44 2015 UTC,I just felt bad for the mother. She was so selfless in giving her children the optimal life and they barely seemed to appreciate it. I mean the boy was quite a ass hate. Althou I think it's a fairly realistic depiction of raising your average hyperactive kid. Other anime like usagi drop while being good shows basically an idealized version of a kid.

anime,3e1csh,FloridaLynx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:44:18 2015 UTC,"I've seen all three and I do not rank patema inverted or the girl who leapt through time better than Wolf Children. Both films are not as original as Wolf Children.  Patema Inverted - a lot more scifi than wolf children, however, there is a popular british cult film called upside down that came out two years prior, which makes me question if that was an influence on this film.  Girl who Leapt Through Time - this literally felt like the anime version of the 'butterfly effect' starring Ashton Kutcher. I cannot help to think that movie played a very big influence on this anime film.  Hence why I think both movies are ranked below Wolf Children, but I'm bias because Wolf Children is my favorite."

It had very few faults, and sure its not the most mindbreaking movie, but its still a very unique premise and I put this movie easily next to my ghibli favs on my imaginary best anime movies shelf."
anime,3e1csh,_vogonpoetry_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:11:59 2015 UTC,I would have like Patema Inverted more of it didnt try to be so much like Castle in the Sky except fail to capture the same magic as that film.
anime,3e1csh,Jaytsun,0,Tue Jul 21 18:08:14 2015 UTC,What does Patema Inverted have to do with Wolf Children?
anime,3e1csh,Fangzzz,3,Tue Jul 21 07:31:33 2015 UTC,I guess you can argue that thematically both stories are about interactions between two worlds.  I did like Wolf Children a lot more than Patema Inverted though. Light spoilers for both
anime,3e1csh,atlantislifeguard,3,Tue Jul 21 13:30:58 2015 UTC,"I saw wolf children Thematically about being a mother, and despite wishing the best for her children, is ultimately unable to control the future. All she could do was love them and hope that she taught them enough to make the right choices.   While the inversion in Patema was integral to the film, I don't think the condition of being wolves was central, and could be easily replaced by something else. The film could have easily been called vampire children, or children from another dimension."
anime,3e1csh,FloridaLynx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:04:08 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem is that both movies looked like they could of been influenced by live action western films that came out much earlier,  most notably 'Upside Down' and 'Butterfly Effect'"

Fansubbing groups cater to either the first or second demographic, primarily because thats the demographic that makes up the majority of the fansubbing crew.  Demographic 1) Anime must be subtitled with precisely accurate dictionary translations of what is scripted.  Demographic 2) Hey, subs are part of what we are watching so why not try to make it match by putting translations of boards and signs ON the boards and signs instead of at the end of an episode in a Translators notes. It gives each groups subs personality and entertainment, (and the typesetter clearly is a masochist.)

It glows with light, but it can not be touched without burning.  The pot is placed on the stove. Water sloshes. You fill pots with water if you are cooking pasta. The water must be heated to a boil to properly cook.  I must wait.  ...  The water has begun to boil. Bubbles rise and burst, like flying insects being snapped up by bats in the moonlight. The bubbles froth with intensity.  One second. Two seconds.   It is time. I tilt the box.  The macaroni falls. Macaroni is hard until it has been boiled. Once boiled it softens in consistency. The reaction of dough being filled with moisture. 8 minutes must pass for it to properly soften.   The bubbles continue to surface.  I wait. I wait. I wait. IwaitIwaitIwaitIwaitIwaitIwaitIwaitIwait.  I grab the handle of the pot. The pot must be drained. I walk to the sink to drain the pot. A colander has many holes. They are small enough that water passes but the solids to not. I pour the mixture through the colander.  The macaroni glistens. It is slicked with water. Steam rises, coiling like silver snakes in the air.  I pour the macaroni back into the pot.  Butter is added. Soft and yellow, it melts from residual heat. Bright orange powder comes next. This came from a packet inside the box. The packet is torn open to release the powder. It is only natural.  I pour milk over the powdery substance. I stir. Sticky sounds reach my ear. It is obscenely sticky. The powder dissolves. The butter melts.

It wasn't that surprising with his whole savior complex. Plus I couldn't really blame him at first. Sure it was stupid for him to be protective of her if you know how powerful she was as a servant but look at it from his perspective. Imagine a cute, little blonde girl trying to take on the fucking Hulk in a sword fight. You wouldn't think she'd have much chance either if you you applied real world logic to it. Shirou just couldn't comprehend the whole servants being different from humans thing at first."

Pussy whipped Shirou doesn't really make the most intelligent decisions in the beginning.
anime,3dztni,darthnick426,4,Tue Jul 21 14:11:31 2015 UTC,"Actually Shirou doesn't let Saber fight not because she is a girl but because he saw her get hurt and nearly killed for protecting him. Hence, his constant attempts to protect Saber from harm and keep her from fighting other Servants. This is because he can't stand the idea of someone else being harmed for his sake.

Not only was it released in that order, Extra Chorus is also just three 10-minute ""side stories"" that don't have much to do with the Mirai Fukuin movie, but rather tie up a few of the smaller loose ends left from the main series.  Not to mention ending with the Mirai Fukuin movie leaves the rewatch on an excellent note. Along with movie 5 it's probably the strongest of the series overall."

The gg-TakaJun/Coalgirls aren't bad either for the first seven movies, but the ANE subs will make it easier to immediately understand what's going on during many moments in the series.  I will have to say though that I prefer the serif font used by gg-TakaJun/Coalgirls.  *edit: I also very slightly prefer the actual translations gg-TakaJun/Coalgirls used during the Kalafina credit songs.

NHK hit home because I too occasionally feel like Satou did and i could understand how miserable he must have felt during the first episodes. Also, I tend to not trust people easily, even people who have nothing but good intentions so i could definitely understand him questioning Misaki's motivation behind offering help. Which would lead me to Misaki who only seems to do it because she has no self-worth of her own and needs someone who's even more miserable than her to not feel like a total failure. While i don't actively search for people who feel more miserable than i do, i can understand where she's coming from."

""Why are they putting dirt on daddy?....if daddy gets buried he won't be able to do all his work""  and of course the one that really really, really hurts the most ""Daddy? Are you hurting somewhere?"""

I don't remember. Just slightly either way), Wolf Children, Steinds:Gate, end of SAO 2, K-On (I don't actually remember it well enough to remember when or why though. I watched shortly after graduating from college and remember it getting kind of intense), Air, and probably more!  I don't actually remember if Kanon 06 got me to cry."
