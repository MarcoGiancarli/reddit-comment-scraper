If you can route your guitar output to your computer, merge it with the song and level it so your guitar is in the forefront, the quality of your videos will shoot through the roof. You have a great camera and aren't doing it justice by using substandard audio. Other than that, great job on the song. If you have any questions, hit me up and I can see what I can do to help."

Djent,3d9cot,penguininaband,2,Tue Jul 14 16:25:54 2015 UTC,"BTBAM's best?  I want to say that so badly but Colors just can't be beat.  Coma Ecliptic is certainly their most accomplished release though.  For all of the special ""moments"" that Colors had, Coma Ecliptic has better written, fully fleshed out ""songs"".  This is a cohesive release, and its experimentation is done tastefully--nothing sounds especially jarring or shocking throughout the listen.  The instrumentation is incredible on all fronts, right down to the keyboards which are the band's best on record bar none.  Give it a try, it's more theatrical, more melodic than their past stuff, and it's self referential, which makes for a fun time picking the record apart and repeat listening.  It's less heavy, but still meets a metalhead's quota for harsh vocals.  It's mixed very well too...got an incredible drum sound."

Djent,3dbu5h,Thecoltonfactor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:34:05 2015 UTC,"Tie a sock or fret wrap just above the nut. This will help a little bit. There could also be a wiring issue with your pickup. Make sure you aren't getting feedback from your amp/cab if you're standing too close to it.  Also, where in your chain is your gate? If it's after you add distortion/gain then move it back so that it comes before. Even then, I sometimes have a hard gate before and a lighter one after I dirty up the signal just to keep everything under control."
Djent,3dbu5h,ArtieConstruct,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:50:03 2015 UTC,"I don't have the money nor the space for anything that physical, so I focus mainly on VST's and such until I can get in  a better place financially. My chain is Comp-Gate-Tube Screan-Amp-Cabsims-Gate"

Djent,3dbu5h,Smoothok,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:26:21 2015 UTC,"I've never been able to get anything even remotely good sounding out of any tse or lepou amps. They always hiss and hum and have tons of weird noises when I play through them.  But since you say it still happens with other sims then yeah, it may be a wiring issue?"
Djent,3dbu5h,ArtieConstruct,0,Wed Jul 15 06:28:44 2015 UTC,"I'd get an audio interface or di box if you haven't already. If you are going straight into your soundcard from instrument, you get an unbalanced signal which picks up allsorts of interference from power sources nearby and all the  interior components of your computer. Going through something like a focusrite scarlet would especially be good for avoiding this as it uses usb as far as i know. They're the most popular ones among djent kids, I'll be getting one soon most likely.   If you're already using one then I'm not sure. I do get decent results just from using bias without any pedals, just the amp drive. So clearing your signal chain might help. If you're worried you won't have that djenty sound, a small eq boost to the mids after the amp works incredibly well.   If not it could be your pickups but I severely doubt it especially if they are humbuckers. All pickups made a little noise but humbuckers shouldn't be too loud. Maybe move away from your monitor and power sources when playing, or what the other guy said about putting your gate earlier in the signal chain."
Djent,3dbu5h,Smoothok,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:48:48 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I use an interface and I use Bias with no problem. Idk what it is about the LePou and Tse stuff but I can never get them to sound very tight. They also use a shit ton more CPU than I'd prefer

Djent,3d5fst,mcfluffertits,9,Mon Jul 13 17:49:51 2015 UTC,"The term magnum opus comes to mind. Been listening to this band since the beginning and I never thought that an album like Coma Ecliptic would be one of my favorite albums, not only from BTBAM, but from any band. Second only to Colors IMO, Coma Ecliptic is a strange and bizarre take on an already strange and bizarre universe they have created with previous albums. Most people that don't like it, don't like it because it sounds way too different from other albums they've come out with before, but if there is one thing I've learned from the guys in BTBAM, it's to embrace the only constant that is change. Amazing album. Probably won't take it out of my car's CD changer for a long time."
Djent,3d5fst,OHkindgoon,4,Mon Jul 13 18:10:32 2015 UTC,"Seconded. My personal favorite album is and will always be The Silent Circus. I'm drawn more towards the heavier, more aggressive BTBAM. However, Colors is absolutely amazing and Coma Ecliptic is right up there. When they move away from being heavy, at least they're doing something new and refreshing. Definite 10/10."
Djent,3d5fst,pinned_down_and_fist,3,Mon Jul 13 18:14:30 2015 UTC,It's an amazing album. My favorite is The Great Misdirect

Djent,3d5fst,terminus84,5,Mon Jul 13 19:55:35 2015 UTC,"I've listened to it couple dozen times at this point. I LOVED it at first and said more than once that I thought it might be the best album they've ever recorded. At this point I'm pretty burnt out on it. I don't think it has quite the same staying power as Colors or Parallax II. It just seems a little more straightforward/ less complex than some of their past albums. I've listened to most of them literally hundreds of times and I just don't see myself getting that out of this one. That said, it is pretty fucking rad."
Djent,3d5fst,JellyJr835,3,Mon Jul 13 22:51:51 2015 UTC,I personally love this album. Cannot stop listening to it. It is my go to album and listen to it pretty much daily. Different from their other albums but in an extremely good way. The album puts me in a different mood when i listen to it. Its mezmorizing and puts me in a trance like state. I love the way this album makes me feel and think.
Djent,3d5fst,zach_buddie,3,Tue Jul 14 01:13:36 2015 UTC,"It's not their best, but they're headed in a very unique and interesting direction and I love being able to hear how each individual in the band progresses and matures. They've went from standard metalcore to a truly one of a kind progressive metal band, and Coma Ecliptic is a perfect example of the experimentation in the genre. They're going out on a limb and trying new things. As for the music itself, I personally love it. I feel like the piano work is stronger than ever, the songs are very well structured, there's not as many awkward transitions as in previous albums, and there's more emotion put into not only the vocals, but the instrumentation as well."

Personally I would rate it below Colors and TGM, I like it better than Parallax I and II, it's maybe on par with Alaska and Silent Circus but definitely not as heavy. Sometimes its hard to judge their albums based on the nostalgia factor but I think this album is pretty amazing and I like what they've done"
Djent,3d5fst,bighugejake,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:24:01 2015 UTC,"If you don't like Tommy's clean singing (pretty much all the time) then it's not the album for you. I've found the melodies and musical themes to be a bit more simple (maybe more accessible?) on this album compared to previous ones. There's a lot of catchy progressive riffs, and the usual btbam guitar wankery, but there are some fairly minimalist parts too. The piano is featured almost everywhere on the album. ""Turn on the Darkness"" features some vocals from Paul and a really great, almost flamenco inspired riff. There isn't a ""death metal"" section without high complexity riffs or overlaid solo thing. Overall, a very different album, but one that is clearly an evolution of the last few releases. It is by all accounts a ""metal opera"" album."

I am still improving, excuses are lame, but I will admit the last clean section was kicking my ass, hard. After I sent what I thought was a great take, evidently was not good enough and we ended up pitching that ridiculously high note. Hella props to Spencer! Other than that, everything else is raw.

Djent,3cn1bv,LanceLePants,2,Thu Jul 9 10:46:52 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/Azylem and /u/LanceLePants, I'm part of the band Sirens. I play drums/do the electronics/and compose a lot of the material.  First, I wanna say I really appreciate the feedback. Drone has always been composed as part of the full length album so I don't think it does anyone good thinking of the pieces as separate things. The LP is entirely seamless and its very much one long idea. I don't think standalone plays let the tracks have their meaning and context in the scope of the whole thing.  Both Pendulous and Swarm Dynamics we released early in a pseudo-sketchy mixed state. The LP sounds leagues better since we had so much more time.  Anyways, hope you guys will check out the LP and let the big picture guide your judgement. Regards, Zachary."

Djent,3clgfx,Lympwing2,9,Wed Jul 8 20:57:18 2015 UTC,"I think I'd enjoy this song (and many songs from PII/Alpha/ Omega) much more if a different band had released them... Does that make sense? The songs would be completely identical; guitar tone, vocals, tempo, everything. But don't tell me Periphery created it.  I guess I'm so addicted to their self-titled album's sound that everything else they've put out just doesn't sit right with me. I mean, I still enjoy some of their work from the last couple albums, but not nearly as much as their first album. PII/Alpha/Omega left me feeling ""Well, this is nice, but not what I was hoping for."" Which is not a dig at the band or any of it's members, simply a personal opinion.  Definitely still respect everything Periphery does and hope they continue to make music for a long time!"

I hate to push the feminist agenda on this one, but you know DAMN well that if she were a guy how ""attractive"" he was wouldn't even rate in the conversation. It would be a non-issue.  I'm just asking you to be aware of how shitty it is to constantly place value on women based on their looks or their relationship compatibility or what they could bring to the table in terms of attractive qualities. Men don't deal with that shit. We get to, you know, be regarded solely by our virtues.   Maybe she will see your comment though and want to totally hit that.    Right.

Djent,3cil33,Osricthebastard,2,Wed Jul 8 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"I cringed at the ""Dreams do come true.﻿"" comment, and I guess what I said could be boiled down to that. I understand your point, but if men weren't viewed in the same sense Magic Mike XXL wouldn't exist. I'm not as ""sexually driven"" as most men, but I can see how my words could be taken without the context of me as a person, which you can't really convey online."
Djent,3cil33,turdlord,-1,Wed Jul 8 17:28:13 2015 UTC,"but if men weren't viewed in the same sense Magic Mike XXL wouldn't exist.   Men aren't viewed in that sense as a matter of norm. That's why Magic Mike and Magic Mike XXL have been such a big deal because they're exceptions to the norm, not the rule.  Does some sexualization of men occur? Sure. And I've even run into a few genuine female creepers in my day. And it does feel super super gross to be viewed through that lens.  But the scales are not remotely balanced. On a whole women have it so much worse in that regard that it dwarfs what men go through to the point of insignificance.   but I can see how my words could be taken without the context of me as a person, which you can't really convey online.    Aye so I'm arguing that you should just try to be more aware of the subtle biases in perception that will color how people, particularly the women you're commenting on, might perceive what you're saying.  I mean that girl gets a thousand PMs a day many (if not most) of which are far far worse than ""dreams do come true"". You've got to try and imagine how that must feel.  edit: my love of italics is getting a bit tacky."

Djent,3ckxlf,Videinfra2112,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:30:12 2015 UTC,Yeah it definitely is. But it has made a world of difference and I consider it an investment for future rigs. It plays well with tube heads. You just need a load box.
Djent,3ckxlf,Masoo2,2,Wed Jul 8 22:36:23 2015 UTC,"People seem to really like the new amps, but I'm not sure how well they work with the HD's cabs.  I have a POD X3 and the models are in fact great amps for metal, but cabs are sometimes just as (if not more) important as the amp.  Look up some demos on YouTube, I know that John Browne (Monuments) has been using them."

If he's using a regulated mod like a DNA 30/40 or properly built Chinese equivalent then the chances of it exploding fall even further.

The main thing that gives the tone it's Tesseract-ish sound, that shimmeryness, is a pitch shifter tuned up an octave, with the mix at around 50%. The rest is just reverb and delay.

Djent,3c7yvx,QueazyRager,7,Sun Jul 5 19:18:25 2015 UTC,"It's actually in the sidebar:   Djent is used to describe a certain kind of guitar tone characterized when a two-octave power chord is palm-muted; a ""djent"" sound is created rather than the typical chunkier (chug chug chug) sound.  Djent also refers to repeated staccato playing of the lowest-pitch string on a detuned 6 string or 7 string guitar with a powerful attack such that the string goes very slightly sharp upon the pick's release from the string. Lower-gauge strings are used to facilitate this.  Djent tone is many times created using a Line 6 amp modeling product such as the Pod series or the Axe-Fx. When possible, an amp model such as the Big Bottom or Modern High Gain on these devices is used in conjunction with a modeled Tube Screamer in front. Engl and Mesa amplifiers are typically used when tube amplification is preferred.  Djent is widely acknowledged to have come first from Meshuggah, but Misha 'Bulb' Mansoor has arguably popularized the sound. Djent's typical uses give rise to a ""genre"" of djent that is characterized by hi-fi compressed production, polyrhythmic/staccato distorted riffs and ambient clean passages which make liberal use of 9 and other ""jazzy"" chords. Electronica influences such as glitchy percussion and synthesizers are also incorporated."

No one can groove as hard as Tosin. As a result, I'm pretty far off, but it was still fun to make."

Djent,3bos2t,LobbyDizzle,3,Wed Jul 1 14:38:15 2015 UTC,I've watched this video many times. It's more actually musical and powerful than funny. But all those guys humorous approaches to music is what keeps their music fresh and great imo. In my opinion if they didn't have such a great sense of humor they wouldn't have written riffs like the ones in MK Ultra or Zyglrox.  What's even funnier is this facebook page https://www.facebook.com/spenceronceaday?fref=ts

Particularly with the toms, it sounds rather muted/muffled (like that fill @0:26 for example). I think if it were a little crisper it would sound much better. Also with the cymbals, you hear a lot of the high end of the spectrum but the full richness of sound seems to get lost in the mixing. Other than that, it sounds fantastic. :)"

Djent,3bkhef,Tourniquet,2,Mon Jun 29 23:27:18 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one thats over these shitty cover compilations? The original songs are already terrible (or guilty pleasures), and getting a metal (none of these bands are even close to punk) band to cover them is the musical equivalent of stuffing a square peg into a circle hole. When I think Volumes, I think Wormholes or Colombian Faction. Not this shit. I barely made it to the chorus before giving up on this having any redeeming qualities. Just my 2 cents..."
Djent,3bkhef,bajster,8,Tue Jun 30 06:29:50 2015 UTC,"It's just fun man, don't take it so seriously..."
Djent,3bkhef,bajster,-1,Tue Jun 30 12:32:19 2015 UTC,"I mean I'm just saying. The original songs already suck, why are bands wasting time and talent covering them? And then half these bands will go on to add them to their setlists. I remember seeing like half of one of these albums live at Warped one year. I would MUCH rather have this same lineup do covers of old school metal tracks. Why isn't there a compilation album like this but with Metallica and Slayer songs? Periphery killed it on their covers of Metallica's One and Slipknot's Heretic Anthem, but I would almost be embarrassed for them if they announced that they were doing a cover of T Swift's Bad Blood or something. I bet a ton of these bands could take something like Raining Blood or Hangar 18 or Master Of Puppets and turn it into a modern djenty shredfest."
Djent,3bkhef,bajster,3,Tue Jun 30 16:02:34 2015 UTC,"You're basically saying that bands can only stick to their genre and can't branch out and have fun doing a cover? Think of it this way, how many people will be potentially exposed to Volumes now that they have done this cover because it's a mainstream track?"
Djent,3bkhef,kneeod,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:59:42 2015 UTC,"Probably very few. I'm willing to bet that people that LOVE the original will find the cover to be so-so at best, and shudder with revulsion when they hear an actual Volumes track. I tried the very same experiment back when The Devil Wears Prada did that Still Fly cover. My buddy loved the original, heard me blasting the cover (one of like 3 good ones across all of these compilations), and asked why they were so angry. I showed him a track off the Zombies EP and he immediately asked me to change the music. Sure, there can always be exceptions, but I'm pretty sure that 99.9999% of the people listening to these compilations are listening to them because they know the covering artist, and not because they like the original artist(s) that are being covered. I liked metal before I heard Turn Down For What?, and that track is a guilty pleasure. I guarantee no Lil Jon fans are gonna flock to iTunes or the pirate bay or whatever to get their hands on Upon A Burning Body's discography."
Djent,3bkhef,otacon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:09:56 2015 UTC,"I like how they did it, but it doesn't make me like the song. Some other ones aren't that bad though, but that's just me.

I'm very hesitant with letting other instruments be as prominent as the guitars, so I'm surprised the bass came off to you as overbearing. The bass is NOT double tracked, but rather ""double-processed."" I create two tracks with the same recording, and mix each track differently. One track is super low and the other has the ""grit"" and distortion. In this mix I also added some stereo enhancement to the bass to widen the sound and fill out the mix more fully."
Djent,3bhd91,Orikons,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:21:41 2015 UTC,"Didn't come off as overbearing to me, you got the levels right in my opinion. It just felt like there is some overlap in frequency range between the bass and the guitars (not much though)  The part that gets me is that I hear bass coming from 2 sides, leaving less room for the guitars to be separated from the bass.

Djent,3bgph0,FishWithAMustache,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:52:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe it could be cool, but big bands can create a lot of tension and the economics of it aren't sound either. You could say that about a lot of other bands too. The sound and mixing would be a real challenge too. And the other guys wouldn't be doing much most of the time, so you would get a lot of guys going ""YA!"" or ""C'MON"" all the time, which would get annoying. It would end up as a battle of who does leads and who does backing. Cool idea though, maybe for one concert they could get a bunch of guys together to sing/scream one song, kinda like this"

Djent,3bevov,Skatesafe,11,Sun Jun 28 16:20:28 2015 UTC,C'mon man faggy is not much of a descriptor.  I like your tastes in music though and came to recommend Vildhjarta  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WB40Fazwr2I  (Thousands of Evils EP)
Djent,3bevov,nkLottery,-3,Sun Jun 28 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"You're right I should probably edit that, it's a terrible description. Vildhjarta is so insane! The song Nojja by them is one of my all time favorites."
Djent,3bevov,Kanex,8,Sun Jun 28 16:40:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, cause ""feminine"" is any better. Anyway listen to Architects of Evolution, Delusions of Grandeur, and Erra. Although that last one might be a bit too ""faggy"" for you."
Djent,3bevov,Kanex,-7,Sun Jun 28 17:11:50 2015 UTC,"I actually think it is. Regardless, I think it get's the point across. Didn't mean to offend, everyone has their tastes and liking music that has clean vocals doesn't make anyone more masculine, feminine or ""faggy"" (again apologies for using that term)  but clean vocals do sound more feminine to me, it's just a quick way I can describe the sound. Really enjoyed Delusions of Grandeur. You have really good suggestions! Thanks."
Djent,3bevov,Smoothok,3,Sun Jun 28 21:36:30 2015 UTC,"It's not. I get the point you're trying to make, but ""feminine"" is not even close to the right word to use. Not because it's ""offending"" anyone, but because the definition of the word does not suit the point you're trying to make.  Something that would make sense would be ""too soft"", or simply ""too clean"", or my personal favourite: ""NOT FUCKING BRUTAL ENOUGH"". That gets the point across much clearer, and isn't a literary nor logical fallacy in itself."
Djent,3bevov,Smoothok,-2,Sun Jun 28 21:50:35 2015 UTC,"Clearly the statement wasn't that illogical if you understood exactly what I was saying. Deeper sounding usually implies something more masculine, and feminine traits are softer. So as you claimed Softer: Heavier, I simply used Feminine: Masculine. I would go back and use a different description if I could, but is that comparison illogical or lacking reasoning? No."
Djent,3bevov,cfisk42,2,Sun Jun 28 22:18:59 2015 UTC,Completely agree with you about Vildhjarta and with the guy that mentioned HLB. These Swedish guys seem to have some way of being about 10x more brutal than anything else. It's cool that HLB's founder and drummer is now drumming for Vildhjarta.  Thousands of Evils is a ridiculously good album. I hear middle eastern instrument influences in there and harmonic minors which seem to add to the darkness and theatrical nature of the music.

Djent,3b4pea,JackMancactus,4,Fri Jun 26 12:04:10 2015 UTC,Ra. It's not even the vocals that I don't like though. It's the music. It's boring.
Djent,3b4pea,Coofgo,2,Fri Jun 26 12:11:00 2015 UTC,"Ah ok thanks. And yeah, I get that. It's not quite as heavy as before, or as technical. But I think it fits better with his voice and is a pretty good progression for them. Guess we'll have to wait and see what the rest of the album brings."
Djent,3b4pea,JackMancactus,2,Fri Jun 26 12:13:42 2015 UTC,"I agree man. Rot had enough energy to keep me interested, and the vocals on that track are killer but the other releases are just so bland."
Djent,3b4pea,Coltek,2,Fri Jun 26 22:23:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I might be going out on a limb with this, but although their newly released music might be a little toned down in terms of technicality (deeming it  'boring'), the dynamics that each song provides has improved greatly. The way an intense part of the song structure will carry onto a very soft part is seamless. You don't hear it coming, but its not abrupt or awkward. I guess with any band releasing tracks before the album comes out, I'll have to hear the full thing to make a solid judgement. Don't get me wrong though, I love the old, more technical Northlane sound. To be honest though, I wouldn't want to hear the same kind of sound over and over again. It's what makes me eager to follow bands and anticipate their releases; to hear if they're trying something new. Even if it's more toned down, its what is making me want to hear what the rest of the album will sound like. When a band releases new music and its just 'debut album which got me into them VERSION TWO' i'll get less interested with every release."

I'm not sure if you're looking for ambient stuff, or harder heavier stuff, but I'm just dumping whatever lol  OLD:  Meshuggah is where everyone (should have) started off  Meshuggah - Straws Pulled At Random the second half of this song is incredible.  Meshuggah - Rational Gaze  A Life Once Lost - Surreal Atrocities ALOL was the first band in North America that i listened to who immediately reminded me of Meshuggah, just a little watered down i guess. They also have this other song Vulture which might be their most popular.  Perihery/Bulb - Tiger personally, this is the oldest song i ever heard by Bulb/Misha of Periphery. It's got lots of goodness spread out all over the track. wicked stuff.  Volumes - Intake BEAUTIFUL SONG. I'm including them in the old category because this band was one of the last bands I actually had to go to their myspace to get their music. It took them 3-4 years to come out with their EP ""The Concept of Dreaming"" because the guitarist Diego was still in highschool and i think his folks wouldnt let him tour until he finished. They still toured anyway. I remember they played here in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and Diego actually claimed he was sick and couldnt play, but he wasn't even with them. I THINK they were on tour with contortionist or maybe aronsists get all the girls and someone told me he actually flew back home to finish his highschool exams hahaha a year later they come out with VIA, then 3 or 4 yeras later, NO SLEEP came out (and people claimed it took too long to come out. pfft)  Monuments - Admit Defeat  Vildhjarta - Shiver check out EVERYTHING by vildhjarta  After The Burial - Forging a Future Self Album THIS ALBUM CAME OUT IN 2006. just sayin'. the opening track is nuts, Steady Decline, and Forging a Future Self. very impressive album at the time, and they didn't even blow up until Rareform came out.  Cloud Kicker - Dysphoria check out cloudkicker in general. you might not like everything because he's taken a different direction lately, but this shit was HOT back when djent was coming up.  Animals as Leaders - Tempting time Misha of Periphery PRODUCED this album. again, i had to go to their myspace to hear this song. Steve Vai PRAISES Tosin Abasi as being the next guitar virtuoso of our time. Brilliant stuff. all of it. ever.  FELLSILENT - Immerse THIS IS A MUST. this band broke up and former members went on to start TESSERACT and MONUMENTS. brilliant stuff.  Tesseract - Concealing the Fate Part 1 listen. this is THE song by them. i mean, there's the demo with their original singer, but I'd like to pretend like Daniel Thompkins is their true singer. that's why him rejoining the band and coming out with a new album together is such a big deal right now.  Chimp Spanner - The Mirror THE song by Chimp Spanner. very old, even prior to it being formally released on an album.  SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE:  Aristeia - Green Dream this may be one of the most beautiful intrumentals I've ever heard in my life  Tesseract - April masterpiece.  Circles - Eye Embedded someone mentioned these guys earlier. amazing band. great singer. he doesnt look like a frontman, but rgeate singing. the second half of the song is awesome. brilliant stuff.  NEW(ish):  MONUMENTS - Atlas  Vildhjarta - Shadow this is off their debut album. the ending breakdown is NUTS  MESHUGGAH - Bleed this is a no brainer. you just need to know this song.  MESHUGGAH - Demiurge  The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza - Danza III Full Album this band was NEVER considered to be djent in any way before this album came out. I can't remember which, but there are some song on this album that have absolutely DEVASTATING breakdowns in them. When you have an hour to kill, put this on and see how you like it.  PERIPHERY - The Bad Thing damn i didnt even know there was a video for this song. Misha came out with this production video showing everyone his recording process, and the opening riff to this song is something he belted out during the video. blew everyones mind. turns out it was a song on their newest album! mind blown  Red Enemy - Night Eyes DISGUSTING. form ireland i think.  There's probably some I missed. There's also a lot of new stuff out there. This is all I could gather during my time off from work right now."

Ken Sushi of Unearth signed these guys and produced their debut album which featured a new version of this song with a new singer who actually sang, which is what this band really needed. new singers name was john carpenter, and even he was limited in his singing capabilities. anyway, here's the newest version of this song, FLOURISH  they now have a NEW NEW singer which really took them to a whole new level. ex singer of Last Chance to Reason who actually released their album as a VIDEO GAME! google it! it's actually really fun! :D"

They only had their first album out at the time and even then it was only a few months old. I saw them a couple months back and the only song they played from that first record was Icarus which they opened with. I don't think they do much off that album any more since their catalogue has increased so much. A shame, really. Some of my favorite tunes of theirs are from that record."

Djent,3aynuy,Jabbathematt,33,Wed Jun 24 15:43:31 2015 UTC,that was incredibly sad and disturbing to read. I can only hope that Justin gets the help he needs.
Djent,3aynuy,IIIPatrickStevensIII,12,Wed Jun 24 16:20:37 2015 UTC,The post he wrote reads like the letters my schizophrenic uncle writes to my grandpa. Hopefully this can do some good and maybe help some people see the warning signs of mental health problems in others.
Djent,3aynuy,jrodb92,13,Wed Jun 24 17:17:11 2015 UTC,"after digesting his words and thought patterns, schizophrenia is a definite possibility. what makes this even more tragic is that he never got the proper treatment for the sexual abuse he suffered as a kid. furthermore, this statement outlines how mental illness in general is incredibly layered and complex. not only has he suffered severe emotional distress after the suicide of his friend, but he might also have a preexisting condition on top of the other events that he has described. so I would like to echo your statement: I truly hope that people educate themselves by reading this. there are so many other people going through similar struggles as Justin is right now. I wish the very best to your uncle as well, I am sorry to hear that he is also going through something like this."
Djent,3aynuy,IIIPatrickStevensIII,22,Wed Jun 24 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"Man, that's some sad stuff, and something that should be taken very seriously.

Djent,3aynuy,nomis101uk,7,Wed Jun 24 19:23:21 2015 UTC,yeah Aaron marshal being a controlling douche and driving all the others out. effectively becoming Axle rose of the prog metal world
Djent,3aynuy,emywox,8,Wed Jun 24 19:44:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say that.  He had different visions for the project than Anup and Lukas did.

Djent,3aynuy,markwarren_18,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:18:41 2015 UTC,yeah like Aaron being a self absorbed axl rose like member of the band and taking out members he doesnt like. first mike and now the rest. Anup said it best Aaron is getting rid of anyone who didnt fit his direction. but im glad Anup isnt in intervals. he can work with drewsif and others and really shine.
Djent,3aynuy,emywox,5,Thu Jun 25 03:36:48 2015 UTC,"It's totally Aaron's band to do what he wants with it. He started it by himself, and it was clear that the majority of it was his songwriting. Ultimately it's his project and while it sucks that he's not working with the other guys anymore, he decides what to do with his music."
Djent,3aynuy,zao_89,2,Thu Jun 25 04:24:39 2015 UTC,i agree but he could have been less douchey about it and replacing the guys like immediately after letting them go

Djent,3aynuy,bleedingfingaz,3,Wed Jun 24 20:01:24 2015 UTC,He is definitely off or on something. Really hope that he gets it sorted out.... seems as though he will need lots of help though. :( Hope he gets back on track soon.

Djent,3ayq36,ArtieConstruct,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your interest! We are not paying royalties. Reason being is that we are not offering ""on-demand"" playing or downloading of tracks (at this time). We are a radio station, so the songs come on randomly based on the listeners selected location. We are offering free promotional opportunities for bands and a way for listeners to discover new music from their local area or from anywhere in the world. We are also running ad free, so we aren't 'cashing in' on free submitted music either. Once we officially launch, all bands who help us in beta will receive a free PRO account for life, which will include track analytics as well as some other goodies we have in store. As far as the reach goes, we currently have bands on ORE who are from the US, UK and Australia, so we are international right now and will only grow larger once we officially launch. Let me know if you have more questions! I'll be happy to answer as best as I can."

Djent,3aw76v,fdreddit,2,Wed Jun 24 08:18:47 2015 UTC,"Quite a clean mix in comparison to most stuff I've heard posted here! Do you mind me asking what the EQ curve looks like on your electric guitars, as they seem a bit thinned out.   Also one thing I can advise is to try and place a multi band compressor over the mix and pay attention to the low end. The lows are prettt clean in the mix, but they seem to get a bit too pumpy when the kick comes into play. Sort of like a fist pushing into my ears. Which is a great thing when put under control! A multi band would be perfect because you can retain your pretty solid low end, but put it under control as soon as it starts to build up too much.   I'll see what else I can suggest after another listen, overall good job!"

Djent,3auizr,tkeitht,-2,Tue Jun 23 17:18:25 2015 UTC,"*guy  EDIT: Miss read the sentence, my *guy was uncalled for, my B."
Djent,3auizr,tkeitht,7,Tue Jun 23 19:03:23 2015 UTC,i figured it was implied that i was speaking about the former members. no need to get pedantic.
Djent,3auizr,wingut_jeffers,-2,Tue Jun 23 19:07:32 2015 UTC,"Dude fuck intervals. Aaron Marshall is one of the most egotistical musicians in prog metal, this situation just reconfirmed that fact.  I will no longer be listening to nor will I be supporting Intervals.  I also feel disgusted listening to Skyharbor, which used to be one of my favorite bands.  Anup was a key component of Skyharbor. Each band took a huge hit, I don't know what they were thinking.  Oh well, Anup will find a band that's better than both Skyharbor and Intervals combined."
Djent,3auizr,keshavdhar,10,Thu Jun 25 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"That's a bit unfair. Anup left us entirely of his own accord, we discussed the situation over many months, and we simply weren't in a position to tell him to drop Intervals commitments to tour with us - they were the far more active band and could give him the full time touring drummer career that we couldn't. He moved on both for his sake and ours. Of course, none of us could predict how things would pan out with Intervals.   You've got to be silly if you think we would want to let Anup go.  If this still makes you feel disgusted listening to our music then there's nothing more to be said really."
Djent,3auizr,Vulgrr_Display,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:41:13 2015 UTC,"What? Why Skyharbor? Even Anup said he understood why they had to go with a new drummer. The fact that both bands are on opposite sides of the world tends to be problematic and even though the Intervals news sucks, that's not Skyharbor's fault. They have to perform shows and if the drummer is half way across the world, it's pretty difficult to play a show. You seem to be overreacting just a tad."
Djent,3auizr,Drumheadtrial,8,Thu Jun 25 05:08:37 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Misha and mark get him for haunted shores.  Good buddy Elliot on vocals, and marks bro on bass.    I would love to see that show."

Djent,3auizr,bbristowe,5,Tue Jun 23 18:21:09 2015 UTC,Well he got kicked out one band and had to leave one band because he was too busy with the other one.
Djent,3auizr,joe_jon,3,Tue Jun 23 19:03:49 2015 UTC,"The way Anup and Aaron put it it doesn't seem like anyone really got kicked out. Seemed more like creative differences.   Whatever the circumstance, I'm excited to see with what Anup comes out with next"
Djent,3auizr,bbristowe,9,Tue Jun 23 20:13:53 2015 UTC,I interpreted it as 'Aaron wrote a bunch of music and didn't really want my input nor anything I wrote. Just wanted me track his drums'. After rereading Aaron's you can really taste the sugar coated ash.

Djent,3auizr,Bill_Board,12,Wed Jun 24 03:12:24 2015 UTC,lol i knew it was because of Aaron being an arrogant controling asshat. i hope Anup and Drewsif team up and make killer music
Djent,3auizr,FishWithAMustache,0,Tue Jun 23 21:01:46 2015 UTC,"Gotta say, I used to love intervals but Aaron's song writing is just a little bland and repetitive for my tastes. Vocals were what they needed and Mike did an amazing job. I think going back to instrumentals will just be kinda boring."

Djent,3auizr,thebraveryoflies,4,Tue Jun 23 20:30:46 2015 UTC,"All this drama aside, I can't be the only one who's excited about Interval's new lineup and them finally returning back to the good o'll instrumental version most of us fell in love with. I have to say I'm a bit surprised to read that Anup and Lukas were the ones wanting to keep pushing the idea for a vocalist. All in all, it sucks to see Anup go, but if that means a new Intervals in the direction of the first two albums + having Travis Orbin on board. I'm hella excited!"

There is one thing that will turn me off from listening to a musician no matter how good their music is and it's narcissism.  There's a reason why I love Tosin Abasi and Misha Mansoor, they are incredibly humble and down to earth yet they are the best musicians in prog metal at this moment.  It's funny that the prog metal musicians that are in the lower end of the spectrum have the nerve to be so egotistical."

DAW: Audio Evolution for Android (Nexus 7 Tablet) Interface: iRig Used a Line 6 Pod HD 500 to record both guitars and bass. Drums: Soundfont MIDI (Sorry, I cannot EQ the drum track at all, I apologize for potato quality) Guitar: Ibanez RG7421 w/stock pick ups Bass: Epiphone Gothic Thunderbird."
Djent,3ax2ug,Br4mmie93,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:59:46 2015 UTC,"Overall sound is too thin, like everything sits around one frequency range. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the bass is competing with the guitars, while the bass should obviously be mixed below the guitars, with the kick below that. What kind of headphones are you using?  The guitar tone itself is okay, but what stands out to me is that you can hear the picking more than the drums, while you should just hear the drums between notes. To make myself a little more clear: it lacks attack. I know you said you can't EQ the drum track, but I think it's worth a lot to search for a different way of programming drums then. It's important. You may also want to EQ/master each drum separately.  Oh, and what is the snare doing somewhere in the middle of your pattern, accentuating nothing? Sounds a little weird to me, but that opinion could be completely different with a better mix.  Disclaimer: I'm kind of a noob myself. I hope you can do something useful with my feedback."

Djent,3aqo66,warwick607,7,Tue Jun 23 00:00:04 2015 UTC,Man the first album has always sounded great imo. Are they performing it as a band now or just mixing Tosin's creation?
Djent,3aqo66,paravaric,6,Tue Jun 23 00:45:29 2015 UTC,"Your guess is as good as mine, I'm assuming they are recording it again but I'm not sure. Their first album is my favorite, but IMO the sound quality is lacking. It doesn't surprise me because Tosin and Misha recorded it themselves before home studios were the quality they are now. Compare the Joy of Motion to their first album to hear the difference I'm describing."
Djent,3aqo66,warwick607,4,Tue Jun 23 01:00:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just assumed the sound was because of drum machine and other gaps lol. I'm curious how much I'll play the original when this drops. I hardly listen to the original onset of petrification from necrophagist"
Djent,3aqo66,paravaric,3,Tue Jun 23 01:04:39 2015 UTC,I'm going to say something has to do with Prosthetic being Prosthetic and since Joy of Motion did well with Sumarian they are kicking it out.

Djent,3aq2li,horizonoffire,2,Mon Jun 22 16:44:26 2015 UTC,"I think you're getting down voted because ""better"" is kind of a vague word. Travis and Anup are among the most competent modern drummers in the world.   Plenty of us here are drummers. Doesn't mean our opinion is the correct one."
Djent,3aq2li,XxDrummerChrisX,3,Tue Jun 23 16:50:53 2015 UTC,"I think that's a fair point. Anup is good and don't get me wrong I love his drumming. That being said I've seen way more impressive traits in travis such as sight reading, more limb independence as well as being seemingly ambidextrous on the kit. Those are some reasons why I would say travis is a better, or more skilled if you prefer, drummer. But I never meant disrespect to anup or his skill"

Djent,3aq2li,emywox,2,Tue Jun 23 04:44:40 2015 UTC,sounds more to me like everyone got tired of Aaron. first mike then the rest. Aaron wanted to be front and center after mike was booted. the sum of intervals was ( to me ) mike on Vox and Anup on drums. and the bass player. mikes playing was cool and only he could have wrote thoes parts but without the others it will never be the same. i guess ill follow the other guys and i hope anup starts working with Drewsif. that would be sick
Djent,3aq2li,emywox,2,Tue Jun 23 02:24:11 2015 UTC,on that note i want to hear the other guys side of the story
Djent,3aq2li,grandmaballs,2,Tue Jun 23 02:24:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly what it is, and not everyone is going to like this but... Aaron Marshall is a very talented but highly pretentious artist.  His narcissism is the real reason why intervals went from a band to the Aaron Marshall project. I've met him a handful of times and he just seems like one of those incredibly arrogant people. If you read all their posts that's what seems to be the true reason why Lukas and Anup are gone."

If you take a look at his solo tracks like Passenger, Scarlet, and Pale Aura, it just all flows so well and is creative. I want him to start off on his own again.  Edit: sounds Yasunori Mitsuda-inspired"
Djent,3aqibf,xxHikari,3,Tue Jun 23 06:41:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your kind comments. Mark occasionally plays quick riffs he wrote on youtube, which are genius. Same goes for Jake, who has a more official solo (more electronic though) project. We do see Mark do random riffage now and again which is better than nothing. About Yatsunori Mitsuda, you didn't watch my piano video did you? Lol. Maybe he inspires me without me even knowing. He could well inspire Mark. Nobuo inspired Misha afterall."

A beautifully manicured hand nonchalantly pulls a chalice from the hands of some twisted undead creature. She drinks deeply as she spins, the purple marks on her arms emitting light.  Flames rise higher and higher as a faint echo of screaming is heard far, far off in the distance. Flamekin and phoenix swirl and eddy in the room around her as she pulls her red leather coat in close.   The leaves vibrate and then whip open as a swift, lithe body flies through the treetops. She doesn't fight them though-no! They aid her. Her amber eyes look to the sky and she smiles and laughs her bitter golden laugh-she can feel the land in her blood.   A blue cowl is pulled up around the head of a waif of a man. There is no power in his muscles and bones--but he embodies it nonetheless.

Djent,3aig2l,Osricthebastard,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:23:54 2015 UTC,First thing I noticed: dude this is djent. Where's all your low end?  Right off the bat I noticed how much meat the guitars are missing. Now if the bassist is playing dip some of the bass out of the guitars for that section and turn the bass up. Let the bass fill in those low frequencies. But if the bass is taking a break for a section then for that section you need to give a little of the low end back to the guitars (be careful to keep the low end tight though as a lot of lower guitar frequencies are just mud). If you don't know how to automate EQ then right here is your chance to learn it.  Also don't scoop the mids out of the guitars. Mids are clarity. That's why your guitars sound like balls of fuzz. Amateur guitar mistakes 101.  At about 3:15 there's no need to have that lead guitar so loud. If you pan the rhythm guitars a little wider that will get them out of the way. Add a quick delay (quick enough that it will be acting more like reverb than a guitar effect) to the lead guitar to put some additional distance.  Edit: Actually I think I know what you're doing. It just occurred to me that your leads are really mid-heavy and your rhythms are really mid-lacking. I think you're trying to dip the mids out of the rhythm to make room for the leads but you're overdoing it. When you're EQing like that less is more. You want to make little changes that allow things room to breath but that aren't so obtrusive that anyone would be able to notice. Try dipping just a little bit out of the rhythm and adding an equivalent amount back to the leads. Not much. I don't think you should be making greater than 3dB of changes to anything.
Djent,3aig2l,fizzycandy1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:28:07 2015 UTC,Listen to this guy. He knows what's up. Also for the drums either compress more or eq that snare to get a bigger sound. Its mainly preference but a huge snare will make the biggest difference.

The old version I think is a lot more cohesive than the one they released in Oct. 2012, though I bought Memoirs 3.0 because it was at least helping out one of Neema's closest friends and making awareness for the rare disorder said friend had.  Edit: News Story for posterity."
Djent,3a7k69,Ixscoerz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:56:25 2015 UTC,The We Are The Foundations tracks are so much more well written in terms of vocals than the Gnosis tracks. I would have loved to see what Greg and Neema could have done had they continued with the rest of the band.

Djent,39wrkn,thehungrycaterpie,5,Mon Jun 15 12:58:36 2015 UTC,"Take a standard rhythm tone if you already have one you like, and give yourself more gain for things like tapping and hammer-ons to get received better. Delay is nice, and just adjust to taste. You'll definitely want to use neck pup for smoother solos, but bridge can be a more open bright sound as well."

Djent,39wrkn,jn062181,3,Mon Jun 15 14:11:13 2015 UTC,I stick with just a regular humbucker.  For delay you want it to be relatively short (start with 100-200ms and work from there) and I prefer to use a digital delay instead of analog.  I run my signal on the dry side just so it doesn't get too muddy.

They get brutal, then somehow become hardcore, then get just down right gorgeous. Their first EP Red Seas Fire contains some classic songs, like Turbulence, which incidentally hooked me into Djent.  Turbulence I love the instrumental version, but I can't find the official audio anymore. So Here is a cover  And finally The most gorgeous song I've ever heard. This particular song has special meaning to me. I hope to hear it live one day"

Not sure how hard it is on guitar, but on bass (my instrument), Make Total Destroy is definitely a challenge and could be a good one. Zyglrox and Graveless both sound pretty technical too. Some Veil of Maya and Vildhjarta songs might work too."

A few good examples are Totla Mad, Have a Blast, and Luck as a Constant (Personal Recommendation).  Some others could be one of the more technical songs by CHON (Can't think of any off the top of my head), Automaton or Siren Sound by Intervals, one of the more ""classical"" style AAL songs (Or Mestis), or some good old Plini.  Notice:  Only the Periphery and Intervals is in Drop C."

None of these songs I think are bad, just maybe not as good as the others.   On Periphery I - Light. Good, just not  as notable as the others  On Periphery II - Epoch. It's just an electronic interlude; not my thing.  On Juggernaut: Alpha - The Event. Surprisingly, this one was tough. The Event is just an interlude though. Most people would probably say Heavy Heart, but not me.   On Juggernaut: Omega - Reprise. Again, an interlude. I love the bass part, but that doesn't make the song the best.  On The Amanuensis - Samsara. Cool atmosphere and all, but that's all it is.   On ObZen - This Spiteful Snake. Again, good just not as notable.   On Altered State - Palingenesis. This one hurt to pick, by far the hardest one. I love every single track on that album to death but...  On One - Origin. This one hurt too. Again, every single track on this album is great.   On Februus - Exmersion. It's ambient.   On Inmazes - Emily. EDM-ish track. Not my thing. Fantastic album still.  On Måsstaden - Måsstadens Nationalsång. It's 47 seconds long.  On Matriarch - Matriarch. Another interlude. Kind of strange since it is the title track.  That'll be it for now. Maybe I will add some more from other albums later."

I understand the purpose of interludes (especially in Juggernaut) but in most albums I don't like them.

Djent,39i05w,Ms_Carry,3,Sat Jun 13 02:46:17 2015 UTC,"The Amanuensis (Monuments) - I, The Creator:  Just overplayed  Thrive (Sky Written) - Passage (But I love interludes, Epoch on P2 is my favorite track of the album):  Just doesn't fit that well when compared to other electronic tracks on prog metal/djent albums  Periphery II (Periphery) - Make Total Destroy:  Overplayed  One (TesseracT) - Epiphany:  Decent groove but leaves a lot to be desired in the ambient/clean aspect of TesseracT  Periphery I (Periphery) - Zyglrox:  Had to choose one, considered Icarus Lives! but at least I can jam to that on guitar  Travelers (Modern Day Babylon) - Distant Skyline:  Vastly prefer the ambient driven songs to MDB's more groove oriented tracks  Gnosis (Monuments) - Admit Defeat:  I've always felt that the production and vocals on this specific track leaves much to be desired when compared to the rest of Gnosis  Hacktivist (Hacktivist) - Hacktivist (lel):  The other tracks seem much more ""complete"" in a sense, with much better instrumentals  Thousands of Evils (Vildhjarta) - Mist förståndet:  The intro makes me skip the song every time it appears on Spotify  Animals as Leaders (Animals as Leaders) - Tessitura:  Definitely the worst clean-focused track of the album.  The Catalyst (Extinction Level Event) - Destroyer:  This is one of their older tracks and it really shows when compared to the first three tracks of the EP  Clear (Periphery) - Zero:  What can I say?  I even prefer Sponce's Parade of Ashes to this track  Juggernaut: Alpha (Periphery) - A Black Minute:  A good idea (Somewhat ambient), but it just doesn't work when compared to the rest of Alpha.  Should have been on Omega imo  Juggernaut: Omega (Periphery) - Graveless:  Opposite of A Black Minute, feels like it should be on Alpha.  Could probably work (With some slight changes) as a Haunted Shores song  Måsstaden (Vildhjarta) - Deceit:  This track just doesn't leave an impact like some of the others (All These Feelings, Dagger, Shadow, Benblast, etc...)  Bilo 3.0 (David Maxim Micic) - Smile:  Had to pick one, but this is the song that I dislike the most.  The second half feels like something I would find on Bilo 2.0"
Djent,39i05w,Masoo2,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:39:44 2015 UTC,"The Amanuensis (Monuments) - I, The Creator:  Just overplayed   Aaah, that's one of my favorites on that album. Right next to Origin of Escape    Periphery II (Periphery) - Make Total Destroy:  Overplayed   Dude...that song is awesome   Periphery I (Periphery) - Zyglrox:  Had to choose one, considered Icarus Lives! but at least I can jam to that on guitar   Zyglrox is great. I definitely think it's one of the better tracks. But Icarus Lives! is a classic; the quintessential djent song, how could you not like it?   Clear (Periphery) - Zero:  What can I say?  I even prefer Sponce's Parade of Ashes to this track   Zero is one of the better songs, in my opinion. Misha is a fantastic songwriter. I'm pretty sure the general consensus is that one and Nolly's are the two best tracks on Clear.    Juggernaut: Omega (Periphery) - Graveless:  Opposite of A Black Minute, feels like it should be on Alpha.  Could probably work (With some slight changes) as a Haunted Shores song   Especially when you consider the story, Graveless is a fantastic song and definitely should have been on Omega, I think. I quite like that one."
Djent,39i05w,FishWithAMustache,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:21:42 2015 UTC,"I'm the complete opposite regarding Clear. I love Misha's writing but Zero and Nolly's song just don't do it for me. The latter feels really repetitive. Summer Jam and Pale Aura are my favorites.  Totally agree on Graveless though, that's my favorite song on Omega (besides Omega), it just gets me going whenever it comes on."

I usually find that certain segments of songs ruin it from being amazing. Albums that come to mind with cringy parts through otherwise solid playthrough... I think of  Bilo 3.0 - David Maxim Micic The Didact - Means End Three - Numbers  Eyes Wide Opium - The Dali Thundering Concept  Ever Forthright.."

Ive been listening to their 1st album ""How terrible, the undergrowth's jaws that tangle"", for years now. (I still think it's my favorite album, new stuff is good too ofc).   Check these guys out everyone, they are very talented.   My only ""gripe"" is that the live videos i've seen, they play too fast!

Djent,390otg,Prad3nas,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:48:32 2015 UTC,"Discovered these guys a day ago. The catch is, they know the beauty of weird chord progression. Listened through their new album in constant anticipation and they always delivered. My only gripe would be the production. It's so loud to the point where it's wheezing, gets pretty annoying. Not that I can't get used to it but still. I remember that Structures album, the loudness was plain annoying and no sound system could handle it."

Djent,38qi90,MatticusXII,6,Fri Jun 5 23:34:13 2015 UTC,Saw these guys with The Contortionist and Chon. They killed it live! Definitely a band worth backing.
Djent,38qi90,Narshredder,4,Sat Jun 6 03:18:35 2015 UTC,"+1  They put on a great show, had great crowd interaction, and all around seemed like nice people.  And IMO they had the best tone of the night (At least in my venue, a really small place)"

Djent,38qi90,Oyab,2,Sat Jun 6 07:28:53 2015 UTC,"The best part is, they pulled this riff from a demo track they wrote a couple years ago which was even more ridiculous, then toned it down a bit to fit this song.  Knowing full well what these guys are capable of technically, I'm really hoping they continue pushing it further. It could get truly insane at some point."
Djent,38qi90,MasterShitLord,2,Sat Jun 6 11:37:18 2015 UTC,Saw them open for Rings of Saturn last fall. Very awesome set and cool people too. I talked with Aaron and he was super nice!

I cranked this one out pretty quickly because I didn't think it would work very well, but it turned out better than I expected so I'm thinking about redoing it and putting some more time into it. I'd probably keep the same vocals though because I'm just an instrumentalist. Unless someone wants to collab and do vocals?"

Djent,38fj6p,Lil_Oly17,3,Thu Jun 4 06:05:53 2015 UTC,I really liked Dan's vocals and I thought the falsettos gave the songs a cool little variation. Glad he's back 100%
Djent,38fj6p,Not_KGB,2,Thu Jun 4 13:44:17 2015 UTC,"I'm stoked Dan is back. I was so disappointed with the direction the band took with Ashe in the line up. I don't know how much I care about the last album and how it sounds with Dan, didn't care much for it from the start. However, I'm excited about the new stuff recorded with Dan."

Djent,38fj6p,nkLottery,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:27:50 2015 UTC,They're competently performed and it's worth hearing these songs live still.  Wish they gave Exile and Eclipse a try somewhere along the Altered State run.
Djent,38fj6p,mcfluffertits,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:15:48 2015 UTC,"Dan should sing one, ashe should sing altered state. The two singers defined their own era of tesseract."
Djent,38fj6p,Lympwing2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:15:32 2015 UTC,"Dan hits the notes, and sings them well, but when Ashe sung them, they just felt so much..more. But then again, Ashe seemed to struggle with some of Dan's vocals. I think Dan has more of a presence live too."
Djent,38fj6p,Mr_Bluelight,2,Thu Jun 4 12:58:29 2015 UTC,definitely agree with the live presence of Dan
Djent,38fj6p,Coofgo,0,Thu Jun 4 15:46:17 2015 UTC,"I don't like them either. He's not a bad singer at all, I just don't like the WAY he sings. And those stupid falsettos or whatever he does."
Djent,38fj6p,FINGERFUCKMYDICKHOLE,6,Wed Jun 3 23:05:18 2015 UTC,Probably because ashe naturally has a higher range than dan. I would assume they would write for his range on the new album
Djent,38fj6p,NellyFrattato,0,Thu Jun 4 05:26:23 2015 UTC,"Before bashing me, understand that I love both Dan and Ashe as vocalists. They're both fantastic and I don't prefer one over the other. The reason I'm prefacing my comment with this is because for some strange reason, there are some serious Dan fanboys who will ignore or dispute anything negative about him, just because he's Dan. At least that was my experience last time I made a post about his vocals on here.  However, when Dan rejoined the band, I brought up concerns on this sub about Ashe's range being too high for Dan to pull off live. I wasn't just pulling this out of my ass. I'm a trained musician and understand how the human voice works in relation to music. People told me that Dan would be able to do it. Ok sure.  Then the first clip came out of him doing the end of Nocturne. I suggested that the reason that they posted only the last part of the song was because Dan struggled with the chorus of the song. Soon after, the full version of the song was posted. Yep. He struggled. People said he'd get better, while I agreed, I still held firm that he'd be limited by where the range of his voice sits.  Now here we are... A live album... And Dan still has to go to his head voice frequently during Ashe's material. This isn't Dan's fault as, for the most part, a vocalist only work with the vocals chords they were given.  My concern was valid.  I will give Dan kudos though, because while he can't do everything with his full voice, he can do more than I would have guessed. His vocal work on the first song of the live album is goddamn impressive and blew me away. I'm guessing they did that one first so he'd be fresh for it.  Overall, I really like Dan's vocals on the live album and can't wait to hear what TesseracT next. I'm guessing their next one will be even better than Nocturne, and that says a lot."
Djent,38fj6p,FishWithAMustache,-4,Mon Jun 8 00:19:38 2015 UTC,Why did Ashe leave cant they just get him back?

Djent,38fj6p,jshrmstrng,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:16:56 2015 UTC,I think part of it as his technique wasn't as good as Dan's and he couldn't handle the constant touring from both the touring aspect and the strain of all the constant singing took on his vocal chords.
Djent,38fj6p,Ms_Carry,-2,Thu Jun 4 13:46:51 2015 UTC,"He doesn't hit those same notes as Ashe does, but I still like it.  I still prefer One over Altered State, so I'm glad that Dan is back."
Djent,38fj6p,MildlyMoist,-2,Thu Jun 4 05:57:48 2015 UTC,"A few of the really high parts just didn't sound right, but I still think he did a fucking awesome job. He's no Ashe, but he brings his own shit to the table which I dig."

I have high-mid gain, slightly less bass, boosted mids, slightly less treble. Know how to slap and when he uses it. I play a dean 6 string (which I love). No distortion, no effects. Bass knob is in the middle, volume and treble are all the way up, but that has very little to do with it, in my opinion. I can't give you a concise answer, but I'd thought I should share what I know.

That said, I understand why PTH might get more love elsewhere, they have 4 critically acclaimed full length albums, and are a bit less niche than Vildhjarta.

Djent,37a3q1,goomyfollower666,7,Tue May 26 02:36:40 2015 UTC,"your not gonna like the answer but its a 2 part mission. first part is the gear. no matter what others say its way way harder to get that tone with anything less then a 11 rack, hd 500, or axe FX2. and the second part is your picking."
Djent,37a3q1,emywox,4,Tue May 26 05:33:18 2015 UTC,LePou amp sims (which are free) and a good IR can do the job. Your playing technique also plays a huge part.
Djent,37a3q1,MattARC,3,Tue May 26 10:43:11 2015 UTC,"Have you tried the lepou plug ins? They have a very nice engl Sim, combine that with some other after effects and a cab Sims (also free, don't remember what I use though) and I've gotten some really nice djenty tone."
Djent,37a3q1,hackjar,2,Tue May 26 07:11:17 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I do, with a few tweaks.   example"
Djent,37a3q1,toxicapathy,2,Tue May 26 13:26:38 2015 UTC,Free. You can change out the amp vst for different ones. I think there is some better free amps. https://youtu.be/L6PHzkPjH7c
Djent,37a3q1,THEDAWNISYOURENEMY,2,Tue May 26 15:14:57 2015 UTC,In podfarm I use a very mid rangey low gain tone. I then parallel compress my tone in my daw to get it even tighter. Then double track everything.
Djent,37a3q1,jrodb92,1 point,Wed May 27 01:06:40 2015 UTC,"Looking at aspects outside of software: I find medium or thin-ish strings can really help.  I also roll back to 7-8 on my bridge pickup's volume or else I start losing clarity and snap.  I keep a mid/low-ish setting on my high gain channel of a 5150 2x12 combo with a mod to drive the tubes a little hotter.  Finally, if you have an overdrive pedal that you can use as a clean boost (leave the drive low with high tone/mid volume) to tighten up your sound, that'll help too."

Djent,374see,InfiniteQuasar,2,Mon May 25 11:01:31 2015 UTC,That's amazing for a pitch shift
Djent,374see,InfiniteQuasar,3,Mon May 25 12:56:42 2015 UTC,"It's sort of a 3-step thing. I have 3 tracks of the same recording. One is pitch shifted down an octave, with a low-pass at about300-500hz, another has a low pass and a high pass so only about 500-5k hz are there, and its a got a crunchy overdrive on it. The third is the top end, 5k-15/20k hz, and that's got a tube screamer on it to give it a high-frequency fuzz. Then I just spend ages adjusting the levels to get it to sound as good as possible. It works way better than it should."
Djent,374see,InfiniteQuasar,1 point,Mon May 25 14:25:10 2015 UTC,pretty interesting. Definetly have to try that sometime. May I ask what you use for recording?

Djent,374oas,BakedCheese,5,Sun May 24 21:10:22 2015 UTC,"Thats a good question, Ive been listening to the style for a few years now and out of probably around a hundred bands that I've heard, Ive only heard 3 bands that have ""manly"" cleans, Vildhjarta and Uneven Structure and DSME. I too wonder why we have such a shortage of deep voiced singers in the world of djent."
Djent,374oas,Matt11768,3,Mon May 25 00:46:25 2015 UTC,A fairly recent addition to that list (at least for me) is VOLA. Their vocals remind me of Uneven Structure.
Djent,374oas,DekuNut,12,Mon May 25 21:11:36 2015 UTC,"It's because tenors in general are more popular than baritone singers. Also, i feel the tenor range provides a greater and more necessary contrast of high tones to low guitars. Deep voices and deep guitars too similar most of the time. Also the extensions of upper structure chords that play the ambience over the low heavy tonic focused rhthyms are best reflected through higher pitched vocals."
Djent,374oas,Orikons,3,Mon May 25 04:45:26 2015 UTC,"Intervals or the HAARP Machine have/had Mike Semesky, who I think has a great mix in terms of pitch."

Djent,374oas,LucasJLeCompte,5,Tue May 26 03:00:23 2015 UTC,"/u/orikons made a good point about how the vocals sit in with the rest of the music, though I'd like to point out that super low register guitars are not exactly a new thing in metal and plenty of the older bands managed to make it work with deeper and more gruff singers.  That said. The historical reason for this is where the bands are coming from. Most of the djent out there is being put out by young early twenty somethings. The same twenty somethings who were listening to post-hardcore, emo, and pop-punk about ten years ago. Then when they started to get in to metal they made the natural progression towards metalcore. Then as they got older and their tastes started to mature they began to discover proggier bands and wanted to emulate those bands. But in doing so they borrowed a fair amount of influence from the bands they liked when they were younger and thus you have djent which is a weird hybrid of progressive metal with metalcore and a few post-hardcore elements.  IMO it's neither good nor bad. Many of these kids will deepen their register as they get older. I liked youthful vocals when I was younger and as I got older I started gravitating towards more mature vocals so I predict that in the next 5 years or so a lot of the djent bands coming out will have a more mature sound."
Djent,374oas,Osricthebastard,1 point,Mon May 25 07:27:57 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, high stylized vocals are par for the course in progressive music, and it's just another genre element."
Djent,374oas,KoA07,1 point,Wed May 27 23:02:45 2015 UTC,"""High pitch"" a better term. None of the bands you listed are ""whiny"" (for an example of whiny, check out early FFTL when Sonny was still their singer).  High pitch vocals contrast with the low guitars. Sounds cool."
Djent,374oas,Lelvolution,0,Sun May 31 01:22:59 2015 UTC,Because Djent is the 2010's Hardcore.  I guess.  Originality is hard.
Djent,374oas,offworld92,-2,Sun May 24 22:58:38 2015 UTC,"You'll notice that most bands that are guilty of that are metalcore bands also. It is a blight on the genre in my opinion, and I can't stand it."

Djent,374oas,Bhigh93,0,Fri May 29 02:29:54 2015 UTC,"Easy there partner. I don't. I do still give those bands another go round every couple of months to see if I feel differently. So far I like about 10 more bands that I used to not be able to stand.  That said, everyone is entitled to their tastes, I like stuff you probably don't, and judging by your reaction, I don't like stuff you do. It's all good in the hood."
Djent,374oas,danny_fiasco,2,Fri May 29 02:49:11 2015 UTC,"It definitely belongs with some bands, but with others, it feels forced, or like it's only there because ""everyone else is doing it"". I don't prefer them, but I can admit when it's done well, and there's not a lot of it.

I even take my riffs and see how they sound if they were being played by a piano or harp.  When a idea becomes a song I just export it into a midi file and open it up in Reaper.

Djent,36rsu7,MatticusXII,17,Thu May 21 16:43:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, but so what? There are tons of terrible, generic bands in every genre. Shitty bands don't detract from the actually good ones. If anything, it will make some bands put in the extra effort to make sure their music doesn't sound generic."
Djent,36rsu7,oxygenvictim,3,Thu May 21 19:42:38 2015 UTC,I'm just amazed at how quickly all of these shitty unknown djent bands have risen so quickly
Djent,36rsu7,Flame_US3r,5,Thu May 21 19:45:36 2015 UTC,"Well, djent was a wonky name for a guitar tone until about 5 years ago, when periphery exploded. People saw an untapped style of playing and it's grown exponentially since then. Eventually you get saturation and stagnation. We've been at that stage for a few years now, imo.  edit for grammar."
Djent,36rsu7,hepcecob,1 point,Thu May 21 20:20:06 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of the word ""djent"" until periphery came out.  Prior to that it was Meshuggah who was considered ""math metal"" or ""progressive..."""
Djent,36rsu7,oxygenvictim,3,Sat May 23 13:55:30 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's been happening in metalcore/post-hardcore for a while now, it only makes sense that djent was next. Like I said though, while it may be annoying to wade through all the shit, we'll probably get some better music out of it."
Djent,36rsu7,tumtadiddlydoo,1 point,Thu May 21 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"I wish more people understood this about music instead of seeing all the shit-tier bands and thinking the whole genre is shit, and this goes for any style of music."
Djent,36rsu7,Flame_US3r,7,Thu May 21 23:49:35 2015 UTC,"The reason you are seeing the saturation of 'djent' as a genre and a massive influx of new bands is because it's what is hot right now. Metalcore was hot in the mid-2000's and the same thing happened (in fact, a lot of metalcore acts still around are now shifting their sound towards djent).   It's been this way forever. Skrillex dropped the bass on pop music and now every fucking pop song has wubs in it. Back in the late 80s, the same thing happened to death metal (on a smaller scale) and grunge in the 90s.   Basically, your chances of hitting it big as a djent band are really slim right now. The bands that define the genre have already carved their niches and there's not much room left for innovation without departing from the genre entirely. That's not to say djent is dead, or that new djent bands aren't good! It's just the unfortunate reality of genre saturation and popularity. The giants (Meshuggah, Periphery, Tesseract, etc) will remain and evolve. The smaller bands will attempt to nail the big tour spots and carve out what's left of the niche.  That's why the ""rectangles"" parody is so good, because it identified all of the tropes in djent and displayed them with no holds barred."
Djent,36rsu7,Predawncarpet,9,Thu May 21 20:07:25 2015 UTC,"I've noticed the same thing. Everyone wants to do djent and beat-down. In my area there are maybe 3 or 4 ""djent"" bands. And the sad part is some of them could be talented, but they make the same mistake of rushing everything so that they can play live shows within the first month of being together. My band has been together for about a year, and we haven't played any shows because we've been working to get a full set as perfect as it can be."
Djent,36rsu7,Predawncarpet,6,Thu May 21 17:32:17 2015 UTC,props to you guys for taking your time to put out a quality product instead of rushing into live shows / releasing an EP so you can get your name out there.
Djent,36rsu7,JackMancactus,2,Thu May 21 17:39:48 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I look at it. I will go ahead and say our music is a lot more technical than the other bands (I'm not trying to promote myself, just saying it how it is) A close friend of mine has recently started a band and it's basically cookie-cutter Black Tongue, while my band is more Acacia Strain/Black Dahlia/Rings of Saturn. I'm not going to say his band doesn't sound awesome, but they are so quick to try and get out there that they don't worry about the product they're putting out. The way I've always looked at it is, we have our whole lives to play shows. We only get one FIRST show. And I want our first show to go perfectly."
Djent,36rsu7,Predawncarpet,2,Thu May 21 17:47:30 2015 UTC,great. got any songs up on youtube? i'd like to check it out!
Djent,36rsu7,manvonrichthofen,1 point,Thu May 21 21:31:31 2015 UTC,"That's what my band is doing now, and the exact same mistakes we've made in the past. We put together some songs, never bothered to record anything, then just started playing shows without putting much effort in otherwise.   Now we've changed the name, been working hard on some good songs for the past 6 months at least, and plan to record at least one before we play a show. Granted, we do have a small show booked in July but that was mostly to push us to finish things up."
Djent,36rsu7,jrodb92,2,Fri May 22 14:11:37 2015 UTC,"It's always good to take your time. I used to be in a band that was the same way. And as anyone who is in any production knows, you're never as ready as you think you are. We thought we would be recording way before we ever started and spent like a year with posts of ""going to be recording soon"" but each time we were about to record something would go wrong and we would never have the followup. I refuse to go back to that model so with my current band we don't even mention recording or showing tracks until we actually have something concrete ready to go. Even then, all we have right now are scratch tracks that aren't really ready to show. We would be fine doing live shows but we've been stuck in line-up limbo looking for a drummer."
Djent,36rsu7,Flame_US3r,1 point,Fri May 22 15:31:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I think! I recently got into Djent music, was really digging it at first since it combines elements of thrash-type riffing, polymeters and ambient stuff, but it's like everyone sounds the same these days! I have huge respect for bands that actually put djent on the map such as meshuggah, periphery, tesseract etc. but I guess what sets them apart for me is the flavor they bring as a result of a cohesive group of people, each with different talents and ideas and each progressing in a different direction musically. The resulting amalgamation of ideas really adds a new dimension to the music.  Also, the genesis of ""djent"" has more to do with people trying to go into into progressive metal, picking up influences from metalcore and progressive metal acts like dream theater. But I feel the bands I mentioned above (periphery etc.) don't try to limit themselves exclusively to the genre and that's what really contributes to their success. Another example I would like to cite is Skyharbor. While their first album used similar tunings and voicings associated with Djent, they were instantly different in terms of how they approached the music. They seemed to limit the use of excessive polymeters and which helped their groove sound much less ""synthetic"" and more involved. And their sophomore album, ""guiding lights"" sees them moving even further from their supposed djent roots, creating epic soundscapes and concentrating on the flow of the record. In short, the album barely sounds djent even though is uses a lot of what djent is made up of.  Another thing to note is the huge influx of bedroom artists thanks to DAWs becoming so affordable and basically making music production something even a 14 year old can get into. Though this might be good in the way that it allows newer bands to get their stuff out easily, it also has the inherent problem that literally ANYONE can now come out with a record. Not to mention, they all use the same AXE FX presents and same programmed drum sounds which really turns everything into one big generic accumulation.  Bottom-line, I feel you bro. Too many djent bands all sounding the same. Hope this changes. Really looking for a breath of fresh air here.  Peace!"
Djent,36rsu7,goodbye9hello10,1 point,Fri May 22 00:53:23 2015 UTC,I feel like djent is on it's way out and bands are actually splitting off into full blown prog or groove oriented metalcore.

Haven't kept up with drum stuff since I stopped playing haha.    Juggernaut IMO has the perfect mix!  It's so thick but so clear at the same time.

Djent,36euka,Aneron,3,Mon May 18 21:00:36 2015 UTC,"My two cents:   Guitar tone: awesome.  Kick Drum: needs more kick/klick in the eq, compressor and maybe some reverb, you could also turn that a little louder.  Snare: way too loud, needs equing and a compressor or even another snare sample ( maybe cut the sample so its a little shorter? its uhm ""too dynamic"" for metal imo).  China: ok, but also way too loud .  Ride/Bell: absolutely gorgeous.  If you add a bassguitar, the whole thing would also sound more balanced.   When theres a snare hit you can actually see how much louder it is in soundcloud. a mix shouldnt have large volume spikes like that.   Id just turn down the snare, while having it in the loop, til its about the same lvl like the kick drum, then turn both up and stop before its spiking over the guitar tracks.  In metal production its mostly like snare and kickdrum are the loudest part of the drumset, then come toms, then cymbals.   (Theres a lot of really detailed tutorials on how to mix drumsamples on Youtube.)   The part where the chugging creeps in is pretty thall btw :D  Dual Signal has pretty sick parts too, nice writing."

Djent,36euka,Nat_xd,2,Mon May 18 21:22:06 2015 UTC,"the bass needs to stand out a LOT more and have a more defined tone. I would really recommend this free plugin before the amp/cab because it just really makes it shine. That plugin is modeled after the sansamp bass driver pedal and just about every modern metal bassist uses it.   I can't tell because i can't really hear the bass but make sure the bass isn't in unison with the guitar(playing at the same octave). having the bass playing an octave below the guitar just really makes it sound so much wider and pleasing to the ear.   Overall, the mix is pretty great and a non-musician wouldn't notice these minor flaws. keep it up!  Edit: forgot to add, double tracking the bass isn't entirely necessary. In my opinion it just sounds too messy and unneeded."

Djent,35yeu2,glassjesoos,1 point,Thu May 14 15:36:16 2015 UTC,"Production skills really improving! Glad to see the end of the guitar pro drums. What you may want to start focusing on now is mixing the drums better. They sound like they are in the background rather than interacting with the guitars. The guitars themselves interact really well, but they are a bit loud and the low end is quite flubby; try using a multiband compressor. I look forward to your new releases"
Djent,35yeu2,TheSkyHasNoAnswers,2,Sun May 17 00:50:06 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for the feedback and I'm glad you noticed I changed the drums.

Flawless playing, also love how cleanly you move around the fretboard. However if I had to be extremley pedantic (and if you wanted someone to pick out any minute errors) I would say that in only a few spots the timing was a teeny tiny bit out (but as I said that's only me being super pedantic).

On the other hand, just as many people will see an album that signaled the demise of one of their favorite heavy bands, a band that was reminiscent of a time when clean vocals were sparse and trends seemed less overpowering."
Djent,35plkw,hultgrenyo,1 point,Tue May 12 22:42:05 2015 UTC,"You're not, the reactions I've been reading vary from your disappointment, to elation, to the guy at the bottom of this thread that needs to take a lesson from you on how to voice his opinion a bit more subtly. It's a normal thing when a band takes on a different path, especially when it's this different. I personally absolutely love Matriarch and haven't stopped listening to it since it leaked (sorry Mark), but I definitely understand the frustration of the old school VoM fans that can't dig the new style.  Edit: Marc, damnit."
Djent,35plkw,Lt_Spliff_Kroker,1 point,Wed May 13 20:39:55 2015 UTC,"Bands move and progress. One that remains the same is one that choses not to try new things, or does very little in the way of innovation. I love hard metal, but I also have been at a loss for more accessible djent with clean vocals. I personally find this to be a breath of fresh air."

But, for the most part, it sounds like a lot of material intentionally cut from weaker Periphery material.   We can all see what they are attempting I just think they could have blended it a bit better.   The cleans also sound like a straight rip from Spencer."
Djent,35plkw,bbristowe,-4,Wed May 13 01:35:46 2015 UTC,This sounds like Born of Osiris on Valium with shitty punk singing.   0/10 what the fuck am I listening to

Djent,35ho28,LicheilSouma,1 point,Sun May 10 13:50:52 2015 UTC,"Are you looking for something like the cleans in this?  For that, it's quite simple. I mostly just used some hefty delay and reverb. There's a compressor there, which sort of evens out the picked notes in there, so they seem to sit deeper with the delayed + reverberated sound.  The cleans in this (skip to about 1:45) are a bit different. It's still got the spacey delay and reverb and a compressor, but there's also a pitch shifter, pitching up an octave, so it sounds loosely like a 12 string (that's what Tesseract do, for there ""Milton Cleans"" tone). I record 3 tracks usually for the cleans. 2 identical ones, panned 60% l&r, and then there's a center which either plays the same thing or a harmony or just picks out accents."
Djent,35ho28,Lympwing2,2,Sun May 10 15:42:26 2015 UTC,exactly what i needed. i wanted the more tesseract-ish cleans. thanks a lot
Djent,35ho28,redarrow18,1 point,Sun May 10 18:56:10 2015 UTC,"I mean a lot of reverb tails, a little chorus and delay.  A lot of them play like single note runs, not a lot chords, and there's harmonies too.  I was on this quest a little while ago too, and this is what I came out with!"

I was familiar with the band before (P1), but this is the track that really got me into the band. Really though, almost every song these guys put out is crazy awesome.   ""Aspire"" by Northlane. Besides Q-Flux, this has got to be one of the best tracks that portrays everything Northlane is about. Crushing, djenty guitar; gentle, spacey parts; and just some killer screams.   ""Intake"" by Volumes. Oh man, when this song transitions from that smooth, spacey intro into those heavy, jolting riffs, man, that just gets me going.

The guitars, the vocals, the drumming, the song writing, the lyrics, the heaviness.. It's all perfect. King of the genre.

Djent,34tuih,Dropsonic,3,Mon May 4 14:48:27 2015 UTC,Great band! Ive been listening to Inmazes nonstop since I downloaded it.
Djent,34tuih,EliteLLama,2,Mon May 4 20:42:22 2015 UTC,"I've been listening to this band nonstop since I first heard this album. The song Inmazes caught me because it sounded a lot like Dancers to a Discordant System, and their clean vocals and melodies really flow after heavy, rhythmic sections.   Great stuff. :)"
Djent,34tuih,Koooookalo,2,Mon May 4 20:21:11 2015 UTC,Just bought this album two days ago. It's amazing. Like Opeth and Meshuggah had a kid and let After the Burial raise it.
Djent,34tuih,Scleropages,2,Tue May 5 03:24:56 2015 UTC,They certainly do deserve a listen. That's why we posted about them a week ago.
Djent,34tuih,JimboLodisC,3,Tue May 5 12:43:40 2015 UTC,They deserve two listens. That's why I posted them again.

I hope they put out more material soon. This band really encompassed the whole'djent' vibe for me. Now that they seem to be brandishing the lower octaves I really, really want to hear more."
Djent,34v16b,bbristowe,1 point,Tue May 5 03:36:46 2015 UTC,They have apparently made alot of progress already on the next full-length release

Djent,34v16b,FeelsToWaltz,1 point,Tue May 5 15:40:59 2015 UTC,Pretty good but it is lacking structure IMO. Alot of the songs feel too spastic and all over the place. Hopefully they can get back to the more structured songs on their first release.

Although alone everything sounds cool, it seems like there would be a ""riff"" that gets played 4 times, then goes to the next riff 4 times and so on, not much flow between IMO.  Either way, sounds sick though."

Djent,34nqbb,BustaLoders,11,Sat May 2 21:08:54 2015 UTC,Vildhjarta is pretty tits. A lot of the other djent bands aren't really my cup of tea.
Djent,34nqbb,aznkriss133,2,Sat May 2 22:36:45 2015 UTC,Got into them a couple weeks ago actually. One of my favorites at the moment.
Djent,34nqbb,JamesGoodall,3,Sat May 2 23:05:49 2015 UTC,If I were stranded on an island and all I had to listen to was måsstaden I'd be okay. That album is fucking amazing!

Djent,34nqbb,dj0ntCosmos,6,Sun May 3 16:27:18 2015 UTC,"Along the lines of what you're listening to:  Architects - Progressive Metalcore in a similar vibe to Erra  Monuments - The best band that ever was  Reflections - I think they just broke up but good, heavy yet melodic prog metal / metal core  Structures - dey go hard  Volumes - When it comes to Djent, these are your boys  Born of Osiris - You might like their latest two albums  Shokran - Similar vibe to new Boo, I really like them  Instrumental stuff:  Animals as Leaders - The obvious. One of the most talented djent bands.  Scale the Summit - Similarish to AAL, great band. Guitarist also has a jazz project.  Modern Day Babylon - The songs ""Infinity"" and ""Travelers"" sold me  Outrun The Sun - When it comes to chill ambient djent, they win  Intervals - New stuff has vocals, I prefer their instrumental EP  Ambient / Clean Vocal / Sometimes mellower:  Circles - Very underrated  TesseracT - errbody knows em. They did just get their old vocalist back, so new album will likely be more aggressive  misc.:  Plini - If you start getting into the jazzy side of things, this guy is great  Textures - Vocals are going to be different than what you're used to, but the song ""Reaching Home"" sold me  happy dj0nting"

Djent,34mkh4,Bill_Murray2014,3,Sat May 2 14:53:12 2015 UTC,"I like the guitar tone, but it's a bit too thin in the mix, making it sound distant. The bass actually sounds pretty great to me EQ wise."

Ark is the opener, Laythe is the apex of the album, the pinnacle, Concept is the closer. [mute] is the interlude/ intro to Laythe."

A few of the rhythm sections are a bit djenty I guess, but this dude isn't what I would call a djent player, and I'm not a genre nazi.    I Listen to this and away with words all the time.  Stellar albums.  Just monumental guitar playing.  The guy has such a firm grasp on how to be a solo artist yet still blend his heavy and catchy rhythm sections in so fluently with his virtuoso style playing.  Really blurs the lines between virtuoso/prog metal and nu-metal, even without a vocalist. The chorus lick in this song is one of my favorite guitar sections ever written by the way.  It's not even crazy ""complex"" but the way he pulls it off and makes it sound the way he does is just so fucking cool."

My advice would be try learning to play a lot of other songs you like. This will help shape your brain's muscle memory into grooves and music you like. That will in turn, help your writing skill."
Djent,3455hq,Northern_Ensiferum,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:37:56 2015 UTC,"I'm going to agree with this. Learn songs you want to write like. I use guitar pro and put the song at 25% speed and work my way up. I usually can never make it to 75% or 100% speed cause I'm simply not that good, but I learn a lot about the structure.   Now when I play, I can fuck around and usually make something that sounds cool.   Look up polyrhythms too. They can be fun when done right but I wouldn't overdo it."
Djent,3455hq,CoffeeScentedUrine,2,Tue Apr 28 14:06:35 2015 UTC,"When Meshuggah started out ""djent"" was called ""poly-rhythmic groove."" That said, they would set down a 4/4 drum groove and then the guitars would set in with a different time signature over top of it and a few, or several, measures later the two time signatures would line up again and your brain becomes ok with the weird groove. On top of this the kick drum will often follow the chugs of the guitar. As a beginner, 3/4 guitars over a 4/4 drum line would be the easiest to start out with and once you're able to handle that move into 5/4 over 4/4 and if you're really cool you can go 9/8 over 4/4. If you're looking for something that is a little easier and  more immediate than reprogramming all of your muscle memory check out This video. It's made in jest but the results show that this is a viable method for making beginner djent."
Djent,3455hq,ThatDerekGuy,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:46:07 2015 UTC,"There's not really much of a way to explain it, I think. It took me a while to work out how make my own stuff. What I do is I come up with something in my head and then try to work it out on guitar. It always ends up completely different but still works. I guess the way to do it is literally just make stuff. Eventually you'll get there."

Djent,33viy5,jrodb92,2,Sun Apr 26 06:00:28 2015 UTC,"the guitar tone is only vst plugins, signal coming through a digital pedal for a clear signal."
Djent,33viy5,jrodb92,2,Sun Apr 26 16:33:16 2015 UTC,"Ok. so one of the tricks that I use is sidechain compression. You basically split a signal and one of them you leave alone, and the other to compress the fuck out of. You then bring the compressed one up to volume with the other normal signal and you will get a much more punchy tone. It works great on guitars and bass. Another tool I use is busing. It's where you create a new track and route lets say your rhythm guitars to it. This way you can adjust the volume on both with one button, you can also mix them even further this way by adding effects and plugins to the bus. I think your drums sound fine. Quad tracking rhythms is always a fun thing to try, especially if you want to make a part stand out like a chorus. But you're gonna want to not pan the extra tracks hard left/right, but maybe like 75% left/right or whatever you like."
Djent,33uw50,glassjesoos,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:23:38 2015 UTC,The guitar pro midi drums really don't do this any favors. There are tons of drum samples out there that you can program just as easily.
Djent,33uw50,TheSkyHasNoAnswers,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:52:52 2015 UTC,Yea I am looking to upgrade them. Any comments on the rest of it though?
Djent,33uw50,TheSkyHasNoAnswers,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:50:12 2015 UTC,"Sure, So i think your guitar playing is tight but it doesn't sound like very full, very bassy and theres not a lot or any high definition so look into some tutorials on equalization and record with a patch that has more mids and highs.  Composition wise I do actually like what your doing. reminds me of meshuggah (Which is a good thing). The subtle modulations are cool and effective at keeping the song interesting but you may want to add some different parts that vary a bit more from the rest of the song since you dont have vocals.  Im also not hearing a bass track and if you dont have a bass just record a guitar track on clean settings with a lot of highs and mids and pitch shift it -12 semitones.  Just work on your production and guitar patches, I look forward to hearing your music mature."
Djent,33uw50,TheSkyHasNoAnswers,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:15:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the helpful comments! I definitely agree that my production is pretty bad. I'm working on the drums and my mixing so hopefully it will start to sound better. I might buy a cheap bass in the future or as you said I'll try the pitch shift. Meshuggah is 100% what I was going for so it's great to have that recognized. Again thank you very much. Feedback is extremely useful.

Djent,33nwq1,Attheveryend,2,Fri Apr 24 01:37:36 2015 UTC,"Compared with the release version, I removed my game boy drum patch, made a recording of my favorite drum patch and double tracked it in Sonar 8.  Then I let one drum track lag behind the other ever so slightly to approximate the track having been imperfectly recorded twice.  Also I added a gigantic bass eq spike around 60 hz.  Normally a bass eq spike is a terrible idea (its like a 10 dB spike) but with my chiptune thing it might have worked.  What do you think?  EDIT: the bass spike eq is not on the drum track, but on the other stuff"

Djent,33i0e8,Westgateil,3,Wed Apr 22 23:46:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm thinking about it.   I think there's a lot in the production too. And everyone here knows of Misha's producer-y goodness.

Djent,33jbm5,DrSeafood,3,Wed Apr 22 23:50:03 2015 UTC,"I just downloaded DrumMic'a today, it works pretty well so far. There's a bit of a registration process, but it's simple and takes a minute or two. It's also free!  Another I've used is Drumcore 3, for things like this. It's super easy to use, no registration or anything, *it's only downfall for me is that it only has three toms to choose from, so you have to get creative with drum fills. It's free too!  I don't know how Reaper works but I use them with FL Studio. In FL Studio's files there's one called plugins, it contains a folder called VST. All I have to do is copy the downloaded file into the VST folder, then load up FL Studio and refresh its plugin list. Hope that helps though it probably doesn't."
Djent,33jbm5,toxicapathy,3,Thu Apr 23 00:39:14 2015 UTC,"I use Steven Slate for my drum programming in Reaper, and its super easy to get started. No matter what program you buy/download, Start in Reaper by loading a new virtual instrument onto a track. Select whatever drum software you buy, and allow the outputs to come from multiple tracks (this is for seperate eq and mixing purposes). Once everything is loaded put a new Midi item on the main track and you can start messing around with the midi to write your own track, or a lot of drum programs will have premade grooves. A lot of learning Drum programming comes from experience, so keep messing around.   Also, Misha Mansoor has some different production videos on youtube, and he specifically has one on Midi drum sounds for self production purposes. It helped me understand a lot of techniques for this genre of music."

The instrumentals are fantastic, but to me Spencer's vocals are as much of a part of each song as Matt's drumming or any of the guitar tracks. I know a lot of people don't like his style, but I think it fits Periphery better than anyone else could"
Djent,337f0x,AIDS12,4,Mon Apr 20 06:53:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not being facetious, and I understand and wholly respect the value of discussion as I say this:  I wonder if there are some people out there who think that they would truly be able to influence us to become an instrumental band, or put out instrumental releases, or have us essentially do anything we don't particularly want to do if they present us with a certain argument or point of view to justify their subjective opinion.  Feel free to chime in if you are one of those people, I am genuinely curious!"
Djent,337f0x,iambulb,2,Tue Apr 21 02:17:28 2015 UTC,"I think the debate here is centered around musicianship. To those who are like me, and play music and love music...instrumentals are where we learn the most, and discover the most.   That being said, Spencer tells a story. And he has gotten much better at doing it since his first demo work (IMO). So that adds its own value to people who enjoy the songs for different reasons.   Misha, the only thing I will say, is that you guys decided to have a instrumental release of P1, and I totally listen to that version differently than I would the completed version with vocals. They are both amazing in their own respective ways. Hearing P1 with no vocals changed the way I thought about music. It was an awesome experience, and I still go back and listen weekly to that album. I'm sure that it affected me, much in the same way Meshuggah's Chaosphere affected you.   You guys have every right to do what you want with your IP, and I respect that. But just know that for many of us out there the instrumental stuff holds a special place in our heart for the love of music, and we cherish being able to hear it.  Thanks."

Djent,337f0x,FaceTron,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:02:52 2015 UTC,"I think most people just like to voice their dislike of things. I'd be genuinely surprised to meet someone who thinks their opinion will change what a band thinks. Ultimately the band is making music they  like and want similar-minded people to listen to. If someone can't get into an aspect of the music, that's their problem, not the band's.  That being said, I do like listening to instrumentals from time to time if I'm just in a mood to zone out to some riffs/grooves. But I don't think bands should have to cater to that.  The only other thing instrumentals are good for is vocal covers. :P"
Djent,337f0x,Jabbathematt,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:28:58 2015 UTC,"I would be surprised if any band changed their sound to suit some of their fans as that goes against what most bands say they write music for, which is themselves. I feel like a douche now that you have said this, I don't want you to change your sound for me or anyone else who agrees, I was just wondering if anyone else felt the same way. That being said I'm a bit of an outlier anyway since I don't really listen to any music for the lyrics, I listen for the music more than the vocals. Spencer is an amazing vocalist but his style distracts me from the music. Cheers for replying"

Djent,337f0x,FishWithAMustache,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:25:14 2015 UTC,"A mate of mine tried to get me into Periphery originally. I loved all the instrumental side of things, but Spencer's vocals were something I could never get into. Maybe I was just unaccustomed to Spencer's vocal style. But anyway, I kept at it, and now Spencer is my favourite part of the band. Once I got used to listening to it, I pretty much started worshipping it."
Djent,337f0x,jjkmk,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:49:41 2015 UTC,"Their first album has an instrumental version. I would highly recommend giving the vocals a second try and getting into them. No one seems to like them their first time around, but once you can appreciate them, you're in for quite a treat."
Djent,337f0x,noseminer_,0,Mon Apr 20 11:41:54 2015 UTC,"I think the vocals add a lot of depth to their sound. People say the same thing about Dream Theater, but I think they are missing what really adds a lot to the song, and the live performance."
Djent,337f0x,Edins,0,Mon Apr 20 23:48:58 2015 UTC,The songs on the first album were all written as instrumentals and it is obvious when you compare the instrumental vs the album how many things seem to get lost when the vocal melodies are overlayed.  After the first album though the vocals become essential to the songs.  On their latest albums there seems to be alot more restraint in the complexity of the guitar work to let the vocals carry more weight.
Djent,3348ch,Jackal904,1 point,Sun Apr 19 11:17:44 2015 UTC,"That's some bright ass tone. Almost sounds like a single coil perhaps? I dunno, but there's some ridiculous clarity and high end happening, and I'm a fan. It just pops."

He's probably using a Pod HD here (speculation, but I've read he records almost exclusively with Line 6 stuff). There is something decidedly not humbuckery about his tone here, which is what really stands out to me. I think Anup uses single coils once in a while, but other than him, I haven't seen many djent guys rolling with anything but a humbucker."

Djent,32nx0w,PinkeGambit,11,Wed Apr 15 08:21:49 2015 UTC,"Well, here's my humble opinion. I think EQ is not rocket science, you need to start from scratch and use your ears. However, looking at those numbers I can't help it but wonder what are you doing with your bass. Am I understanding this? At 100 hz you add 15db and then at 200 hz you take away 11 db? Why?   I think EQ is not meant to be that extreme, it's about subtle changes than improve the sound within a certain balance, if you want to make it tighter then it's a matter of using the right compression."
Djent,32nx0w,Meganezuki,6,Wed Apr 15 12:30:21 2015 UTC,"EQ is tricky man, it's about bringing out the good bits of your tone and minimising the bad, but you also have to be wary that too much EQ can KILL your sound. As a rule of thumb, you want to achieve your tone WITH THE LEAST EQ.  Now we've got no idea what kind of tone you've got from your setup, so we can't tell you what will work. But to give you something, you said you wanted a tighter sound... You could try d-d-djropping the bass (100Hz) for a clearer low end with more space for the bass and kick. Or you could boost more mids (800, 1.6k) for more attack. Or you could tame the upper highs, while boosting the lower highs or vice versa.   Just play around and reference tones you like throughout the process.  Overdrive:  For me though, the biggest key to a tight tone is running an overdrive in front of the amp boosting the input signal. This will give you more 'crunch' from your amp and allow you to back off the gain on your amp for a clearer tone. On some amps, I run gain at like 3/10 with overdrive behind it. You may already know this, in which case great. Try backing off more gain again.  For further reading: http://www.connorgilks.com/apps/blog/show/20495920-guide-to-djent-tone  Peace."
Djent,32nx0w,Stubacka,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:31:06 2015 UTC,"Hey, I will definitely try using less, but for the 100hz, my tone sounds a bit too 'trebley' so adding the 100hz somewhat makes it sound like there's bass playing along. It isn't that noticeable, here's  A like for a demo of my tone:  http://youtu.be/symXBNhpBFU"
Djent,32nx0w,benisanerd,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:35:07 2015 UTC,"I'd dial back the attack and sustain on your compressor, and maybe try to tighten up the noise gate a little bit. What are you using for distortion? I've found using a cab simulator in addition to a milder digital distortion gets a lot closer than just full force distortion pedal, really helps with the higher end especially."
Djent,32nx0w,christopherw,2,Wed Apr 15 17:50:46 2015 UTC,"Most of the time EQ is about subtracting bad frequencies. You can boost but it should be done judiciously.   Pick a frequency and set the Q high if you can (so a fairly narrow range). Boost it to +6 or +9 then slowly sweep through frequencies, low to high, until you find a boxy, harsh or nasty sound. Then, dial it back a few dB -- then do again with the next EQ band. Idea is to work along the spectrum smoothing out the response."
Djent,32nx0w,JackMancactus,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:08:13 2015 UTC,"Adjust a little at a time, not +/- 15 like you're doing. Make tiny cuts, like +/- 3. Personally (just based on the patch I have for my pod) I would cut a little from 100, 400, and 6.4. Then boost a little at 1.6. Like no more than 4 db either way."

I'm willing to bet their new album is going to have a lot of new styles mixed in it, while still keeping their aggressive roots. Definitely an album that will please many."

I miss Brandon :/  And before anyone calls me butthurt I will say that I'm glad VOM is changing. They can experiment with a new sound, It'll open up a new fan base, and appeal to a larger audience which is what they want. I've been with them for a long ass time and I'll support them all the way. Hopefully they'll put out something with a more CMC feel to it though."
Djent,32iypx,djentleman1,3,Tue Apr 14 04:54:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, it doesn't sound like VoM to me. They are experimenting for sure but in my opinion it just sounds derivative and generic.  If someone put this in a playlist with a bunch of mainstream metalcore music I wouldn't have known it was VoM.  Which is pretty disappointing."
Djent,32iypx,sqrt-1loveyou,2,Tue Apr 14 18:13:04 2015 UTC,It sounds too... structured I guess is the right word. The great thing about VoM is that they have the feeling of no one in the band knowing what they're doing but at the same time knowing exactly what they're doing. If that makes any sense.

The second version you made here kind of solved the problem partially but I think I just realized where the issue is. I can hear the eq imbalance mainly during the intro, in which you can only hear bass and mid-lows. Maybe it's your rhythmic guitar's EQ within pod hd. Make sure it doesn't have an insane low gain and negative mid/high, although you can compensate this on the mix  The composition is excellent though. Sick riffs."

Djent,329xry,oxygenvictim,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:31:38 2015 UTC,"Complex syncopation, perhaps.  What I meant was that djent, like dubstep, is a very recognizable genre phenomenon. And what characterizes these two genres most profoundly, Djentdjendjen-DjentDjent vs Wubwuwu-WubWub are not quite complex techniques. Of course, any talented artist of either genre will be utilizing ideas and styles from other musical genres.  Djent, for instance, have adopted math-rock/metal concepts. This is a good thing. Like this song, it is complex on a music theory level. And of course, this is why this song sits here on a djent sub.  As time goes on the genre will become diffuse and eventually become a beautiful hybrid of mathy-djenty goodness, but I don't think anyone can honestly argue that djent at its core is a simple and recognizable technique that usually takes place on one string and relies on unusual syncopation rather than true complexity.  That being said, I love the djent sound complex or otherwise. Complexity isn't always the factor that separates awesome music from good music."
Djent,329xry,Anticode,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:52:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the entire genre of djent is completely the whole ""djent djent"" thing by itself. I think the idea is that it is a sound that makes bands in the genre unique, but bands that use other elements as still djent bands. Stuff like the Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza/Glass Cloud, the Contortionist, and Veil of Maya all utilize concepts that could be considered ""other genres"", but they still are djent bands that play complex music."
Djent,329xry,oxygenvictim,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:57:41 2015 UTC,Then we agree.
Djent,329xry,Anticode,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:09:25 2015 UTC,Yeah seems like mostly semantics.

Djent,329xry,AussieGuy96,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:29:29 2015 UTC,What would be the name of that style? I absolutely love that kind of music!  And also why does it feel similar to Animals as Leaders (which is Djent if I understand correctly) ?  And Thx OP for sharing!
Djent,329xry,2FastHaste,2,Sun Apr 12 11:03:57 2015 UTC,"The 'Djent' part of Animals as Leaders comes from the use of the lower strings on a guitar or bass and the way these are played. they're kind of plucked, almost slapped. This song doesn't really contain the same technique of 'djenting' a string, though the song itself sounds exactly like AaL. In this song, the punch in the lower notes comes mostly from the distortion and the bass drum, not so much the technique.  It gets complicated when Djent becomes a genre-title; can a song be djent without using the djent technique? it's like a slow speedmetal song.  edit: and about the genre: they tag themselves as ""mana-core; math rock; post metal; progressive rock; rock; instrumental math rock; post-hardcore; post-rock; progressive; progressive metal."" but I'd say there's some ambient and, well, Djent influences as well."

Djent,329eoh,DeudeWTF,18,Sat Apr 11 19:49:42 2015 UTC,"I'd need to hear more from the upcoming album other than Mikasa but I don't dislike the vocalist but I also don't think it's Veil of Maya -  I think in verses there are a lot of VoM sounding riffs and progressions but overall it feels like they kind of lost their unique sound with Mikasa. Don't get me wrong, I actually like the song but with only their previous stuff to go off of, it's a weird change.  That being said, I'm all for bands going in whatever direction they feel is necessary. Each of them had a say in the album and if they didn't like the way it was going then they would have put a stop to it. They're clearly all proud of the music they've produced and I enjoy something that thought has gone into if I can see the passion behind it."
Djent,329eoh,Jambo165,9,Sat Apr 11 20:09:04 2015 UTC,"I think i'm in the minority on this but I really like him. Now I only got kind of into Veil after Subject Zero because there old stuff was too deathcorey/blast beaty for me (at least what i've heard, feel free to share some old shit pls).   So I think i'm one of those people who end up liking the band after the vocalist leaves, just because I wasn't a huge fan before.  Now I am totally in the opposite camp with Northlane, because Adrian was one of my favorite vocalists, but I know people who like them more with the new guy so I guess that's just the way she goes.   Sometimes she goes. Sometimes she doesn't."
Djent,329eoh,Westgateil,3,Sat Apr 11 22:30:31 2015 UTC,"I think Eclipse is their grooviest album. I'd look at Divide Paths, Punisher, and The Glass Slide. From id check out Mowgli and from The Common Man's Collapse give We Bow In Its Aura, and It's Torn Away."
Djent,329eoh,JackMancactus,1 point,Sat Apr 11 23:12:40 2015 UTC,"I'm with you man. I dig the new guy. I love their old stuff too but just judging from this song, I think the new album will be great. There is enough VoM in there to still be VoM; it's just a little more accessible.   And if you get a chance to see Northlane live with the new guy, you should. He killed it when I saw them."
Djent,329eoh,ThatAardvark,3,Sun Apr 12 13:04:21 2015 UTC,"I'm salty as shit about it, VoM used to be my favorite band and the lack of cleans was a huge contributing factor to that(I fucking hate cleans). I was happy when Phoenix came out because there were no cleans and I actually thought the vocalist fit pretty well and then they sucker punched me with Mikasa. That said, the part around :46 in Mikasa has fucking great groove and I love mark's riffs in general so I might be able to force myself to like new VoM the way I did with Periphery, they just won't be the same band to me though and that sucks"
Djent,329eoh,goodbye9hello10,3,Sun Apr 12 03:29:27 2015 UTC,"I really like their new vocalist. His cleans are very good, and his screams are much more dynamic than their last guy. I'd have to hear more than just 1 song to really give my full opinion about him though. I do sort of question the way they wrote Mikasa at least. I sort of think it's too much chorus, not enough other stuff."

Djent,329eoh,pinned_down_and_fist,2,Sat Apr 11 21:09:07 2015 UTC,"Garbage can. VoM is one of my favorite bands and the direction they're going I completely dislike.   edit - to clarify, I've listened to VoM for years. that's why I'm so annoyed by them going the way of Volumes/Structures by radically changing their vocals and sound. I'm being critical of them, not bashing them without reason. Albeit a bit harshly but still my sentiment and point stands."
Djent,329eoh,sqrt-1loveyou,4,Sat Apr 11 19:56:58 2015 UTC,I agree. There's nothing wrong with being passionate about a band. While I myself don't like clean vocals. I can still get down to bands who use them as long as their vocalist has a GOOD voice. Veil of Maya always had that raw punch in their vocals that amplified the heaviness of their sound. Their new vocalist I feel lacks that 'punch' all together. Whether it be cleans or screams. I've got all my hopes in Born of Osiris that their new album will sound more like the new reign to make up for my dissatisfaction with the direction. VoM decided to go in
Djent,329eoh,sqrt-1loveyou,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:45:19 2015 UTC,"Hopefully they do. I need to find more music, all of the bands I've liked have changed greatly over the years and I don't like the majority of them."

Djent,31t2m7,ParkerM,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:01:55 2015 UTC,That's awesome how he got that blast beat part to fit in like that.
Djent,31t2m7,christopherw,0,Wed Apr 8 16:57:24 2015 UTC,"I think the word you're after is polyrythmic ;)  Very good drumming though, and nice to see some Vic Firth love (first drumsticks were VF 7As!)"
Djent,31t2m7,zuurrkk,6,Wed Apr 8 02:28:36 2015 UTC,"Nope, syncopation is the right word for it.  Maybe even polymeters. But polyrhythms? Nooo. Two different time sigs have to be played at different tempos in order to fit in the same bar in order for it to be a polyrhythm.  Polyrhythms sound cool, but they're much more neat and tidy and orderly compared to polymeters/syncopation."
Djent,31t2m7,christopherw,2,Wed Apr 8 09:58:21 2015 UTC,"Correct! The word 'polymeter' is (surprisingly) completely new to me - I see it's ""measure [whilst] preserving polyrhythm"".  And lo, Wikipedia spaketh unto me:   Polyrhythm is sometimes referred to as ""measure preserving polymeter"". The beat varies and the measure stays constant. For example, in a 4:3 polyrhythm, one part plays 4/4 while the other plays 3/4, but the 3/4 beats are stretched so that three beats of 3/4 are played in the same time as four beats of 4/4.   However having read this stackexchange thread I'm now more uncertain than ever as to what this piece falls under. Polyrhythm, polymeter or both?  To me syncopation didn't feel like the best word; to me it refers to the very broad practice of altering emphasis - usually the accent of a beat to emphasise an otherwise straight pattern, and not the practice of ""cross-patterns"" (as my brain calls polyrhythms). There's a bit of all sorts going on in this piece.  A second listen not at 3am ;) helped me key into that he's initially going with a 4/4 hat/snare timesig. That middle 5/4 pattern initially threw me for a loop..."

Djent,31k89h,zetobyx,3,Mon Apr 6 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"I think its mostly because people are VERY biased against newer bands material. If its not put out by people who are already established in the genre its just considered another over-saturated release. I personally think this album has alot to offer, and not because of my own personal bias towards it, but because the core of it (the instrumentals especially) were very well written. I dont like listening to my own material, its too weird a feeling to me, but I actually listen to this release. Its just overall very solid and im very proud of how it came out. Not to mention its average rating is a 8.5/10 on got djent and a couple of other sites that promoted it."

Djent,31l62r,theRussianTank,7,Mon Apr 6 02:54:47 2015 UTC,"I got to meet Justin and Trent after a show, and my guitarist friend asked Justin about the tone in Wolves Within. Fifteen minutes later, I still had no idea what they were talking about, but i did pick up that but it was multiple layers of various patches."
Djent,31l62r,jk47drums,3,Mon Apr 6 03:12:09 2015 UTC,"I can't give you an exact run down, but I know they use axe fx II and custom tones. As a baseline, your bass will want to be about 3/4's up, mids about 7/8's or full, and highs are really up to you. I know a lot of guys alternate tones for solo's and rhythm sections."
Djent,31l62r,danny_fiasco,3,Mon Apr 6 04:15:19 2015 UTC,"I will actually go ahead and say for an 8 string the lows are at ten-11 o'clock tops, with the mids at like 1-3 o'clock and the highs at 12-2 o'clock. With higher mids and lower bass you can get away with more gain and still cut through in a band. Dont go over like 3oclock with the gain tho.   I saw them live like almost ten years ago and justin was using a Peavy 6505.  If you throw a volume attenuator (I literally use a passive pedal that's just a volume pot) in my effects loop and crank the power tubes so I get that awesome high volume tube saturation at lower volumes.  Also nice pickups are your friend...but not nearly as much as your hands are. Like 90% of your ""tone"" and edge comes from the way you play"

Djent,318nms,DrSeafood,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:39:57 2015 UTC,Yeah the album is severely underrated imo.
Djent,318nms,Rebuffering,2,Fri Apr 3 21:42:17 2015 UTC,"I dont think its underrated at all, personally. I LOVE this album. And to be honest, most metalheads who give them a listen usually like them too.   The problem is just not enough people know about them"
Djent,317y4p,chaotemagick,5,Thu Apr 2 18:42:37 2015 UTC,"I feel like Meshuggah and Tesseract are the most important bands to show a newcomer to djent. After that it would depend on if you wanna show them the more core inspired side of djent with bands like Periphery, Volumes, etc. Or the proggy instrumental side of djent with artists like Animals as Leaders, Chimp Spanner, etc. Or maybe some more metal inspired bands like Textures or Xerath."
Djent,317y4p,pianodan,1 point,Fri Apr 3 00:24:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah. For me, there'd be branches of djent after meshuggah, like a family tree. Vildhjarta would be alone. AAL and Periphery would be brothers"
Djent,317y4p,pianodan,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:50:00 2015 UTC,I got a very death metal influenced sound from them last time I listened but it seems like they're bunched into the djent genre similar to how Born of Osiris or Veil of Maya is. I don't particularly agree with it but I guess the influences are heard by their greater fan base.
Djent,317y4p,pianodan,1 point,Fri Apr 3 06:10:47 2015 UTC,I couldn't tell you. I didn't dig that deep into them.
Djent,317y4p,hepcecob,1 point,Fri Apr 3 06:23:22 2015 UTC,"Although they may not use the straight up ""djent"" tone, they definitely branched off of Meshuggah with all the polymetric rhythms."

Djent,317y4p,Gunnnar,5,Sun Apr 5 08:55:23 2015 UTC,Not a HUGE djent fan but you guys are definitely missing The Discovery by Cloudkicker. I guess Cloudkicker isn't very djenty in most of his music. But that album is ridiculous and a very early example of the genre

Djent,317y4p,AbysswalkerMusic,4,Sun Apr 5 01:15:34 2015 UTC,"Instead of Tesseract I would put in Fellsilent. It was the joint project of members from both Tesseract and Monuments (before they split and became those bands). They only had one album but it was still a great representation of ""djent"" before djent was officially a thing."
Djent,317y4p,redarrow18,5,Sun Apr 5 01:47:57 2015 UTC,"I mean I can't really think and put detail into it right now, but i guess the way I feel is  meshuggah was crucial to the start of it, and Periphery perfected it.  I actually think that ""djent"" falls in with  Sturgeon's Law, I've heard Misha say the same thing too I believe"
Djent,317y4p,autowikibot,3,Sun Apr 5 02:54:57 2015 UTC,"Sturgeon's law:       Sturgeon's revelation, commonly referred to as Sturgeon's law, is an adage commonly cited as ""ninety percent of everything is crap."" It is derived from quotations by Theodore Sturgeon, an American science fiction author and critic: while Sturgeon coined another adage that he termed ""Sturgeon's law"", it is his ""revelation"" that is usually referred to by that term.  The phrase was derived from Sturgeon's observation that while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, it could be noted that the majority of examples of works in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality and that science fiction was thus no different in that regard from other art forms.

Djent,317y4p,broketm,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:48:14 2015 UTC,"Every genre of music, or any artform falls in with Sturgeon's Law. However, Djent has such a broad application in other genres that I wouldn't say Djent suffers from it as much as those genres do. Meaning how many metalcore, deathcore, crabcore bands use Djent techniques? And how many of those are actually worth listening to? While on the more progressive side of it, it's imo far less a problem... plenty bedroom artists that can be ignored though.  It's the chaff of those other genres that have hopped on the Djent bandwagon that make navigating the djent-genre that much harder :("

Djent,317y4p,Darkchylde89,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:05:16 2015 UTC,"I like showing people the family tree of Fellsilent/Tesseract/Monuments. There are a couple of riffs from The Hidden Words that crept their way into tesseract and Monuments songs, and it's interesting to hear the different styles of Browne and Kahney split off into their more mature projects. On top of that, 2008  is early as fuck in terms of djent history which makes The Hidden Words a really important album in my opinion.  edit: Just look at this live video from 2009. Fastforward to 2015 and djent bands are still regurgitating this exact sound. This band was truly ahead of its time."

I'm not a fan of vocals in music but that bit at 3:04 killed me, fantastic sound. The guitar/bass is lovely and blocky, all be it a little compressed into the rest of the sound at some parts, it matches the vocals great tho' and the combined guitar + bass tone is beautiful. The drum work ties the track together lovely, I don't know anything about drums so I don't know if it's good or not, but it sounds awesome to me!  If you were going to change anything; try to pronounce each word in a line as a group, at the moment it sounds like each word is a new line. The screamy tone is perfect tho'."

Djent,30uzq8,delta4zero,5,Tue Mar 31 11:21:57 2015 UTC,"Wow that is incredible. TesseracT is one of my favorites, and I can only imagine what that experience must have been like. It amazes me that a relatively small band would get such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
Djent,30uzq8,FishWithAMustache,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:31:33 2015 UTC,"I noticed somebody said that Dan did really well. He didn't make any of the high notes, sounded pretty bad.  not that I would be better, especially not considering the temperature and shit"
Djent,30uzq8,sigmar123,4,Tue Mar 31 10:19:21 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't agree. I will never judge Dan on his ability to sing Ashe's parts. They have completely different styles."
Djent,30uzq8,IAMnotBRAD,3,Tue Mar 31 12:08:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true. I guess I'm just not objective enough, probably because of my love for Altered State. One of my all time favorite albums."

Djent,30uzq8,delta4zero,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:35:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, was the same when I saw them, really lost my doubts that parting ways with Ashe was the right move. Still like him better, but whatever."
Djent,30uzq8,sigmar123,2,Tue Mar 31 16:51:48 2015 UTC,"It's not even a style thing. It's a range thing. Ashe has a higher range than Dan. I brought up this concern when Dan rejoined the band and people argued with me about it.   I won't bash Dan for not being able to hit notes while singing on a giant block of ice, however. Cold does terrible things to your vocal chords when you're trying to sing."

Djent,30ugub,vicky00125,3,Wed Apr 1 09:25:31 2015 UTC,"It possesses my personal favorite qualities in music  Rhythmically, it grooves hard but in a dynamic way  Sonically, it's heavy with lots of energy  Harmonically, it's usually* dark/sinister (BOO), exotic (Sumatra), beautiful (Periphery, VOM, COC), aggressive (All of the above. Especially COC IMO eg Listen @ 0:08 on some good speakers or headphones.  It's insane to me that music can actually sound like this)  *All of the bands share these traits to some degree, these are just which ones came to mind for those given traits"
Djent,30ugub,blackm0nday,2,Tue Mar 31 00:04:10 2015 UTC,this.... all of this.
Djent,30ugub,emywox,1 point,Tue Mar 31 06:58:35 2015 UTC,Yeah that's how I feel. I just enjoy all the traits that djent happens to possess. It's a very diverse and experimental genre that can go a lot of different ways. Plus djent has the best fucking riffs.
Djent,30ugub,Jackal904,3,Tue Mar 31 23:00:02 2015 UTC,"Heh. I started in the same boat. Except instead of Tool it was Nine Inch Nails that pulled me out of the formulaic radio playlists. That said, I still love the shit out of those bands I started with. Hybrid Theory is still amazing (although I much prefer the demos with alternate lyrics/additional work from Mr. Hahn, since Shinoda was basically strong armed into dropping his fantastic imaginative verses in favor of some whiny cliche relationship bullshit...), and I highly recommend going back to Limp Bizkit's Significant Other. Yes, Fred Durst still sounds like a wannabe chodemaster, but their drummer is insanely good for what they were playing, and some of their songs were in the tunings we dig in our little djenty world (Nookie is in F#, for example).   NIN planted the seed of wonky time signatures (March Of The Pigs is essentially 29/8), and then transitioned me into industrial metal/EDM (Combichrist, Mindless Self Indulgence, etc), which transitioned into a weird trancey phase, which got smashed to pieces when I decided to listen to some weird band in red jumpsuits with numbers and masks as their identification (Slipknot, in case its not obvious) and instantly got hooked by SIC and Eyeless.   Then it was really a bunch of music discovery thanks to Myspace and Rock Band. A girl I had a crush on had Puritania by Dimmu Borgir as her profile song, and that was it. The same week that happened, a local group by the name of Machine Head who we all probably know and love put out their album The Blackening, which all but solidified my love for metal. The exact same Myspace scenario happened with another girl and the song Diamonds Aren't Forever by Bring Me The Horizon. Brutal shreds without constant blastbeats (nowadays I can't dig a song if the whole thing is blasts. I love it in moderation, like Have A Blast and Omega, but it's gotta change to something else to keep my interest) and some shit called a breakdown?? I was hooked. I got super into all the poppunkmetal bands like A Day To Remember and Of Mice & Men, but got bored just as quickly because it was all 4/4 basic stuff (and breakdowns, while a blast to play live to a crowd that's digging it, are all practically the same shit), so I slowly transitioned into more progressive stuff through Rock Band and a ton of online music sites.   I was also pretty active online with music hosting sites at the time. I had my myspace page, remix.nin was a big deal, acidplanet, soundcheck, soundclick, etc. But the day I heard a Bulb demo in its fully finished form in Rock Band was the day I fell in love with Periphery. I had seen Bulb tracks on the top 10 list on soundclick and liked a few, but never actually got into his stuff until I saw Icarus on the Rock Band music store.   Tesseract was also a Rock Band discovery (I bought most songs with difficult drums, since they were the most fun to play), and the rest is history. Once you put ""Periphery"" and ""Tesseract"" into the same google search, everything is djent djent djent djent Meshuggah djent djent. Once you dig through all the ""Messhuggah did it first!"" bullshit, you find yourself with a hefty list of bands that all sound nothing alike, but somehow all fit under one genre together.   I still love all the music that got me here, but very few genres can captivate my attention as a musician as progressive metal/djent can. There are songs I've listened to countless times that have sections I still can't comprehend (Ragnarok, for example, has that midsection that just doesn't make any sense lol), and it gives me a bit of a throwback feel to the days when the term 4/4 was beyond my comprehension, and wrapping my head around a song was a process."
Djent,30ugub,bajster,2,Mon Mar 30 23:27:54 2015 UTC,"I love technicality and musicianship in music. I can like any song of any genre if I listen to it and go ""huh, that was a cool key change"" or ""damn, interesting riff."" Djent or, on the other side of the same coin, prog metal does that for me in most of the stuff I listen to. It's always interesting, it's always complex but comes together in an inspiring way. The thought that must go into it to create something that can be both haphazard and leave you in awe is astounding to me.  Djent in particular is just such an interesting genre to be involved with. Periphery, Meshuggah, Scale the Summit, The Contortionist, Veil of Maya, TesseracT - they all have a completely different sound and yet are still classified under the same genre due to those little nuances that make it identifiable. I just find it such a versatile genre that brings out so many concepts of music in an artist."
Djent,30ugub,Jambo165,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:53:31 2015 UTC,"I personally just enjoyed watching the wealth of new musicians coming into their own. I also really enjoy the technical aspects of the writing. Everything seems so intricate and well crafted, the elements borrowed from a lot of progressive music acts help keep the genre somewhat interesting.  I grew up listening to a lot of thrash and power metal so I am not really sure what I am doing here. But I feel Djent is a few more albums from simply splitting into progressive metal and deathcore (again?)."
Djent,30ugub,bbristowe,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:50:26 2015 UTC,".It's heavy and emotional. I mean, sure, sometimes there's the technical side of djent that can be a little vanilla, but it almost always delivers.  It's awesome how the artists bring in so many different influences into a cohesive (and badass) end product. I can find periphery songs that'll melt your face off just as easily as I can find TesseracT songs that make you feel like you're floating in a cloud and everything in between."

Djent,30thp2,kindodeku4,3,Mon Mar 30 16:09:01 2015 UTC,"Is there a bass guitar? I can't seem to pick it out. The mix seems to be void of low end. The guitars also sound too bright, just taking a little out will even them up might make it fit better. If also suggest compressing the kick and the bass guitar together, to marry the low end. Add I'd bring the drums up a smidge."
Djent,30thp2,kindodeku4,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:07:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. There is a bass guitar, it's pretty audible on my speakers. I'm not sure on the low end, I try to compare it to other tracks and it seems to be pretty similar to what I compare to. I feel like the problem lies more in the mid/high end of the mix. I'll try to compress the kick and the bass together, right now I'm ducking the bass right around the punch of the kick with a sidechain compressor."
Djent,30thp2,Meganezuki,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:20:18 2015 UTC,"Don't duck it too much! you don't want it to pump like a EDM track. I agree, the mids/highs might be the problem."
Djent,30thp2,msixtyfive,2,Tue Mar 31 01:16:56 2015 UTC,"Man I love what you are doing. It's gonna sound amazing once you polish some details.   Out of curiosity, is that bass guitar real or a VST?  I think at 0:17 I can hear the audio clip being slightly cut, as if you pasted the same riff again and the transition wasn't 100% smooth, but it might be my imagination.  But meh, just details, I love it. Please don't add vocals :P"
Djent,30thp2,three_three_fourteen,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:16:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks, appreciate the support! The bass guitar a VST, Cherry Bass. Yeah, it's cut and paste, I haven't really figured the next part out so I just looped it for now."

Djent,30qgzk,Michael_Caine,6,Sun Mar 29 20:52:18 2015 UTC,"I know Language moved away from the djent side of things mostly, so originally didn't think to post it here! But seeing the cool artwork someone made a few days ago, figured it couldn't hurt to post in case anyone was interested.  Absolutely adore the bass parts on this album, it's great that they're a driving force behind a lot of sections. I'm not a great player, but am decently accurate at transcribing, so hopefully I can save other bassists some time if they wanted to learn any of the songs!  I've only done a full album once before, for Altered State, again which was more a tricky effort of transcribing and learning the rhythms than the physical act of playing for the most part. Hopefully won't wait quite as long to do the next one!"
Djent,30qgzk,bajster,3,Sun Mar 29 20:58:24 2015 UTC,"I remember watching your Altered State video! I don't know Contortionist all that well (their newer music videos didn't do anything for me), but I look forward to watching this.   I gotta say, one of my biggest pet peeves with cover videos is when people edit together a million takes. While I can appreciate the desire to keep things interesting with different perspectives or whatever, I've always thought of it as kind of a cop out to avoid nailing one full live take. You go above and beyond and do full fucking albums in one go! Hopefully like you said, your next one will be sooner than later."
Djent,30qgzk,Space_Haiku,2,Mon Mar 30 00:35:36 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the response, I agree with your thoughts on covers. A cover, let's be honest, is a bit of showing off what you've learned or transcribed or have been working on, but even showing off a little, I'm not going to edit a bunch to claim to be perfect. Just trying to show what I can reasonably do at the time.  It's a strange distinction in my head, at least, because with playthrough videos of original music, I could understand that an artist wants to give an accurate representation of how to physically play their music, so keeping mistakes in is less informative. I don't know, it's a topic of discussion that comes up every few months, certainly some different stances I've read."
Djent,30qgzk,Space_Haiku,3,Mon Mar 30 15:43:37 2015 UTC,"You're a beast man, that was awesome! Also, i'm gonna need you to give/sell me your vinyl copy of Language, I need it, now."
Djent,30qgzk,MsgrMartinez,2,Mon Mar 30 02:54:05 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I love the orange splatter vinyl, really the color palette for the whole album is just beautiful, really matches the more 'organic' warmth to the sound, moving away from the cool blues of purples of the spacey previous albums."
Djent,30qgzk,MsgrMartinez,2,Mon Mar 30 03:21:44 2015 UTC,"Dude I know, I ordered it in october 2014, with a preorder of the new Enter Shikari that was supposed to come out on january 2015, but they didn't ship it separately. So when it was time to ship the whole thing, they sent me an email saying that they didn't have The Contortionist vinyl anymore, those fuckers didn't reserve me a copy even though I had paid. So now I still don't have it and probably never will. It's like my favorite album of 2014. Fuck MerchNow."

Djent,30gagc,o0Djent0o,8,Fri Mar 27 03:02:54 2015 UTC,WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MY BRAIN
Djent,30gagc,Miroist,5,Fri Mar 27 05:23:19 2015 UTC,"It's not totally in 4/4 obviously, there was one part which I'm sure a lot here will pick up on that didn't get cut up, I just couldn't get it right.  All that aside, I reckon it sounds fucking choice as 4/4."
Djent,30gagc,Miroist,7,Fri Mar 27 03:03:46 2015 UTC,CAFO in 4/4 by Anim as Lead
Djent,30gagc,CoffeeScentedUrine,5,Fri Mar 27 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"I love how your brain has wrapped around this.  For the most part I think it sounds great - But why-oh-why did you edit the groove at 1.28 which was already in 4/4? 1.28 - 1.46 is one of my favourite pieces of AAL music precisely because it grooves really nicely on 4/4, and it's the one bit you edited out of 4/4!"
Djent,30gagc,bhindblueiz,1 point,Fri Mar 27 11:34:07 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to see what you mean but for the life of me can't help but hear that section (in the original) as a 13 beat bar, or 2 4's and a 5. I cut one beat out to make it a 12 beat bar or 3 4's."
Djent,30gagc,bhindblueiz,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:33:38 2015 UTC,"When I said 1.28, I meant 1.28 in your track, which reflects to 1.44 in the original. When the original initially breaks down at 1:14, it's definitely in 13.  1.14 to 1.44 are definitely in 13, absolutely.  But then the cool thing they do at 1.44 is the Meshuggah thing: the riff is still in 13, but the hands of the drums drop into a 4/4.  If you count the cymbals in 4, you'll hear that the snare hit is always on beat 3. 1.44 - 2.04 are in 4/4.  I totally see what you've done, but for this 20 second section it plays absolute havoc with my head as the drums are already in 4/4.  By cutting the guitar part to 4/4 instead, the drums have gone completely screwy!"
Djent,30gagc,Necromorphiliac,1 point,Mon Mar 30 08:46:31 2015 UTC,"Haha, ohhh right, yes I'm totally with you. I did notice the snares coming in all fucky there. Definitely a head fuck, but kinda cool at the same time. Maybe I can try and revisit that section soon and try again, there must be another way to make it fit as a 4/4 and keep those snares coming in correctly."
Djent,30gagc,bravemurderday,3,Mon Mar 30 19:48:31 2015 UTC,This was sick. I wanna hear more like this.
Djent,30gagc,EdibleBucket,3,Fri Mar 27 04:58:50 2015 UTC,Neat! At first I couldn't tell until it got to my favorite parts. Good job! How'd you manage to get them to mesh properly?
Djent,30gagc,rargar,2,Fri Mar 27 08:51:42 2015 UTC,"I used reaper to edit this which in my opinion makes this stuff much easier.  I got the tempo (155bpm) and aligned it best I could, then I just cut out the extra beats and realigned each section and did a tiny cross fade between the cut sections to mute any stutters.   For the parts with extra beats I just spliced out an earlier section of the bar and blended it with a cross fade to smooth it out a bit."

Djent,30eg7y,BillyNitehammer,3,Fri Mar 27 09:40:48 2015 UTC,"I am so sad that this album is getting slept on. This is some of the most amazing music I've ever heard in my life. I really just expected a shred-fest tbh, but this has everything. I'm blown away, personally."
Djent,30eg7y,Adamapplejacks,3,Thu Apr 2 04:03:44 2015 UTC,"Truly amazing compositions, and what's more is the level of diversity in each track.  Every song is completely unique.  Jakub deserves some extreme publicity for this.  Hopefully the guest solos will get him more recognition, and people will see his talent."
Djent,30eg7y,Adamapplejacks,2,Thu Apr 2 04:32:12 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, and when traversing from one song to the next, I kept on the edge of my seat. I had no idea what to expect! Very diverse compositions, indeed. I've been listening to this nonstop for the last few days"
Djent,30eg7y,Adamapplejacks,2,Thu Apr 2 04:59:19 2015 UTC,"I wish I could listen to it more, but I've been having problems.  On my phone's audio player, the digital version of the album I received has a noticeable clipping/peaking distortion on the louder snare and kick accents (this happens on the heavier tracks mostly, like Satya's Dream or Fall Of Logic).  It doesn't happen with the same audio files on my desktop iTunes, though.  I can't for the life of me figure out what is causing it, and it's rather distracting.  I'll just have to wait until my hard copy arrives, I guess."
Djent,30gjw0,sqrt-1loveyou,3,Fri Mar 27 04:34:09 2015 UTC,"Lol, it sounds happier, what the hell?"

Djent,30gjw0,MatticusXII,2,Fri Mar 27 21:00:50 2015 UTC,"BUMPIN'  I think it's an interesting take on the song, gives it a lot more upbeat energy. I like how the groove persists despite being faster."
Djent,30gjw0,MatticusXII,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:04:38 2015 UTC,yeah its cool. but i would never prefer this over the original. the original is just so dark
Djent,30gjw0,MatticusXII,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:09:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I would say that I prefer the original as well. It's just interesting variation. I've listened to all of meshuggahs albums at least a couple times so it's nice to switch it up

Djent,30e0sz,KrebiGD,1 point,Thu Mar 26 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's just me, but I think there's something a bit weird going on in the mix. Something might be too compressed or it could just be a lack of mastering plugins.  I like the track itself and how it's composed, but it sounds a little ""distant"" (?). As if I was listening from the other side of a wall. Even if I turn up the volume, I still feel like it lacks sharpness.  After listening to your other tracks I can hear the same effect. I think you could use a maximizer to enhance the mix. I have a few plugins that I believe could make your current mix sound better. If you are interested you can send me a track and I'll give it back to you with some mastering plugins applied.  Again, the way the song is composed is great, imho the production could be a little bit more polished but it's a matter of time and some trial and error until you get there."
Djent,30e0sz,KrebiGD,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:43:04 2015 UTC,"I would love that I know what your talking about, it has a bit of a muffles quality to it, but I'm not entirely sure how to make it more sharp What does a maximizer do? What can I do to make the mix more sharp without just boosting the high end? I confess I don't know much about the mastering side of things other thank it's more volume oriented"

The guitars especially have the perfect amount of that high twangy buzz without being shrill. Drums are great too  (what do you use?). I also like the apparent polymeter in the verses between the cymbals 4/4 pulse and the guitars, keeps it interesting."

Djent,3061p5,RedditbutForgotit,2,Wed Mar 25 15:42:50 2015 UTC,Very true. You can definitely tell who is doing what.  It's funny how some of the groovy riffs are so obviously Browne and that atmospheric stuff is coming from Acle.  I was always looking for bands that were influenced by Meshuggah but putting their own spin on it.  Discovered these guys and was hooked.  A lot of the younger djent kids were still in diapers when that record came out. I was so devastated when they split.  Luckily we got Tesseract and Monuments records out of it after the fact to satisfy the void.

Djent,301jsx,ydroj06,3,Mon Mar 23 21:54:38 2015 UTC,Spencer did vocal production on this record.  There are some tracks where I had to second guess if he was doing guest vocals or not because the new guy sounds so much like him.  These cleans are nowhere near how close he sounds like him on some of the other tracks.
Djent,301jsx,Scleropages,20,Wed Mar 25 15:13:58 2015 UTC,"I'll be the other end of the spectrum here. I like it a lot. Instrumentally, it's every bit Veil of Maya as their previous work. It just has a better produced sound to it. Personally, I'm a fan of the vocals. I'd like to see them do more with the cleans then just a repeated chorus, which I'm sure is where a lot of complaints are coming from aside from that some people just don't like clean vocals."
Djent,301jsx,RedditbutForgotit,13,Mon Mar 23 19:51:11 2015 UTC,I fucking love this! Whole band is super tight and the new vox are great. All praise be to Marc.
Djent,301jsx,Scleropages,10,Mon Mar 23 19:57:38 2015 UTC,Spencer does not need to touch this band.
Djent,301jsx,RedditbutForgotit,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:54:00 2015 UTC,Are you saying that because he worked vocal production on the album? He doesn't physically appear on it at all.
Djent,301jsx,cerbs1234,3,Wed Mar 25 15:14:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Spencer's production on Mikasa makes Lukas' cleans sound too much like his own. It will sell albums, for sure, but as an older fan, I would like to see the band evolve in a more original direction rather than emulating a popular sound."
Djent,301jsx,dcptn,2,Wed Mar 25 15:23:50 2015 UTC,Understandably.  I feel like label pressure had more to do with this than anything.  I still prefer Common Man's Collapse over everything else

Hell, his harsh vocals aren't that good either. Obviously, he's a competent vocalist, but his vocals have no power (harsh or clean), and they don't sound unique at all. 0/10, would not want this guy in VoM for a second album.  It's a shame, because musically, Mikasa and Phoenix are two of the best VoM tracks in years, but the vocals totally ruin them."
Djent,301jsx,timetogetpaid,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:12:20 2015 UTC,"I agree, I don't not like the song and I think I could come to like it, but these vocals are so bland. I don't really have a problem with cleans when used in moderation, but I've heard cleans like this in a million other bands, in a million other songs. They're so generic. And the harsh vocals have no range or dynamic. Like Brandon could go really low and really high and he'd do it at all the right times, this just sounds monotone."
Djent,301jsx,TerraInc0gnita,5,Mon Mar 23 22:27:03 2015 UTC,"Weird, as much as I liked Brandon in VOM, he was much more monotonous than Lukas, their new guy."

Alas, I do not and Veil of Maya was my favorite band for their Death Metal/prog elements, not their metalcore elements.   I'll listen to the new album, but I can't say it will get very many plays. I knew they'd never write TCMC or [id] again, but I never thought this is where they'd go. Brandon Butler would be my beacon of hope, but he joined a metalcore band."

Djent,301jsx,taylorj474,9,Tue Mar 24 14:44:00 2015 UTC,I dig it! Marc has always been a very melodic writer and I think the vocals only enhance that aspect. They are still heavy and still have a lot of elements we are used to just refined. This is actually pretty refreshing for me.
Djent,301jsx,dcptn,9,Mon Mar 23 20:03:48 2015 UTC,I sort of like it. Let's see how the rest of the album is. This sounds a bit too much like periphery for me though.
Djent,301jsx,DrGags,16,Mon Mar 23 19:52:05 2015 UTC,"I normally don't hate on bands when they take new approaches to their music, but I cannot stand how they are utilizing the new vocalist. Totally and completely ruined the vibe that VOM have capitalized on for the last several years. Everything that initially drew me to VOM was lost with this new track. I'll jam the Comman Mans Collapse until the day I die, can't say the same about this stuff."
Djent,301jsx,drake_n_bake,10,Mon Mar 23 19:35:23 2015 UTC,I wholeheartedly agree with you brother. R.I.P. VoM it was nice knowing ya.
Djent,301jsx,Imaybereptar,6,Mon Mar 23 19:40:14 2015 UTC,"I'm personally fine with the direction they're taking. Yeah it pushes their sound in a more ""generic"" direction, but it's very good for generic if you know what I'm saying. I'm glad they're actually evolving with a new vocalist instead of trying to mimic what they had with Brandon."
Djent,301jsx,LHodge,5,Mon Mar 23 22:11:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I just want to point out in case you don't realize, they didn't change there sound because Brandon left. Brandon left because they were changing they're sound."
Djent,301jsx,dcptn,13,Mon Mar 23 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"I'll say this, This is easily the most listenable VOM song to ever come out. It doesn't feel like their old stuff and that is OK. Their hard parts really shine through because their choruses are so simple. The riffs are way more textured with Marc stepping back and using cleans and playing both rhythm and lead parts. I do hope the rest of the album is more heavy though, i hoped the same thing with Peripheries alpha and omega, and i turned out to be pleasantly surprised. Just stop going around saying ""RIP VEIL DEY R SUMERIANCORE NOW LELELEL"" Cause if veil is good at anything, its being themselves, and i'm hyped for the release."

And the ""RIP VoM"" or ""not a true fan if you like/dislike this"" thing is just petty, elitist crap. I mean, I hate what All That Remains have become, but they're still the same band whether I like it or not. Bands, like every other types of artists, are not fan-property. If you don't like it, that's fine but don't hate on other people just for embracing change, whether you feel it negative or positive. Jeez."
Djent,301jsx,DeadsBroSquatsBro,2,Mon Mar 23 20:16:20 2015 UTC,I dont want to be rude but the song as a whole sounds like a generic Sumerian Records song. Although there is some trademark Veil Of Maya riffage going on and the chorus is quite catchy. I just hope they mix up their song structures like Periphery does.  The music video has some questionable cgi and a nonsense story so it is straight from the Sumerian oven too!
Djent,301jsx,japanesepagoda,2,Mon Mar 23 23:59:15 2015 UTC,"I love the whole common man's collapse feel to the song, but those cleans really do not suit them.   I hate those whiny cleans that sound like they featured some shitty pop punk singer in their song to make more money.   It's such a shame too, because the other aspects of this song are all incredible; those technical verses/breakdowns are amazing."
Djent,301jsx,RedditbutForgotit,2,Tue Mar 24 01:21:19 2015 UTC,Agreed this feels more like common man's collapse. Eclipse album felt boring to me the only song I really liked from that album was divide paths
Djent,301jsx,RedditbutForgotit,2,Tue Mar 24 05:03:24 2015 UTC,"The guitar sounds great but these clean vocals remind me of Periphery's, but not as good.  Confirmed why their last vocalist left, the band wanted clean vocals."

Clean vox remind a lot of the generic 'core crap (Sleeping with Sirens kinda), but somehow that wasn't a bad thing for me. I used to listen to that kind of music, although that was 4-5 years ago. I definitely get why some people don't like it, but as long as they don't completely abandon the technical riffing.  Also, what's with people saying this sounds like Periphery? I don't hear it at all. Poppy clean vocals = Periphery I guess..."

I'll still listen to it when it's out, but I'm a little afraid that it won't live up to old VoM."
Djent,301jsx,MilkTrain,4,Tue Mar 24 04:09:51 2015 UTC,"I think saying the ""clean vocals make this sound generic"" is a hypocritical statement.  The same could be said for a lot of the screams.  Bands evolve.  Get over it.  It's still good music."

Djent,301jsx,BefuddledSeven8,1 point,Tue Mar 24 07:24:10 2015 UTC,"Well for me this can go both ways. I love VOM for how heavy they sounded and their more fast paced music. Their old vocalist was quite amazing. Loved his lows and his highs. He was perfect. As for their new sound, its different. I was not expecting to hear this, but in my opinion it is good. They are going a different way with their music and for musicians I believe that's always a great thing to do. Its just not what I was hoping Veil would do, but I wont hate. The cleans are wonderful and the instrumental is awesome. Again, not what I was expecting from Veil Of Maya, but still appreciated."

Djent,3004mq,ZedEffective,3,Mon Mar 23 14:31:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I also think art is the most subjective thing in the world, a million people could look at the same painting and see a million different things. So I'll just tell you what I see in this:  The message behind the whole design is ""alignment."" Consider how 3 things that are vastly different in size are in harmony on this image: First, a tiny drop of water at the bottom, generating waves on the surface of water. Second, a buddha (human being who reached enlightment). Third, a galaxy (the milky way) and all its sub elements (planets, stars, etc.)  The drop of water is like the big bang. Prior to it there was nothing, just a calm body of water. The drop falls and generates consecutive waves on the surface, like the unstoppable creation of galaxies and stars that later form planets in which life appears. Life evolves and grows to understand the universe. It's like the universe created us in an attempt to understand itself. The mind of a buddha is the closest thing to that effort. It understands what it's made of and finds that sense of belonging when thinking about the universe, it sees no difference between us and the universe, everything is one and the same. Therefore the sense of scale disappears and this visualization I portrayed becomes possible in front of the eyes of those who have been enlightened."

All other music genres have been fusions or amalgamations of genres coming together, or progressions of a genre along a theme. Perhaps, on the other side of djent, a metal genre will evolve that focuses on high notes, maybe with the use of pitch bending. Who knows, really. Bubblegum metal could be the next thing."

I believe it was only somewhat recently, when I was 17, when I was exposed to djent (by the likes of Volumes and Periphery).  Not sure what's to come after this.

Moved from there to rock to hard rock to nu-metal, then to metalcore. Now extreme metal is all I listen to (with a bit of hardcore mixed in)."
Djent,2zxw2m,Groovemach,5,Mon Mar 23 15:53:06 2015 UTC,"41.  Too much history to write a musical autobiography of my tastes throughout the years. As for djent, I'm more into Meshuggah than standard djent, but I did get into Anup Sastry thanks to this sub."
Djent,2zxw2m,dudebro_fistbump,3,Mon Mar 23 01:49:25 2015 UTC,Do you like Intervals?
Djent,2zxw2m,Groovemach,6,Mon Mar 23 03:04:34 2015 UTC,"Not to piss off any Intervals fans, but I haven't been able to get into them because the singer sounds a little too whiny to me (which is weird given how much I listen to Evanescence, and Amy Lee pretty much defines whiny). It has nothing to do with clean vocals or anything, but whatever he's emoting just doesn't click with me. They might be something that grows on me with repeated listens, or perhaps I need to pay more attention to their purely instrumental output, but they haven't sunk their hooks in my yet.  When it comes to modern metal (just assume that typical 80s thrash and 90s Alternative, NuMetal, and Metal is a given), mostly my tastes veer off toward bands like Meshuggah, Decapitated, Converge, Dillinger Escape Plan, Devin Townsend/Strapping Young Lad, Fear Factory, Static-X, Mastodon (among a bunch of others). I'm less a fan of djent as a genre than I am of individual artists I might hear tangentially associated with it in some fashion, but even then I think mostly my tastes veer off in other directions. But I sub here always looking for new things.  One of the things I actively do is look for bands that prioritize their song-writing this way:   Write something they think sounds really cool. Write something technical and complex.   I love technical and complex music, the problem that a lot of technical bands have though is that they'll fucking forget that they're supposed to write cool sounding music to go along with it. So we'll end up with complicated music lacking heart and soul, or any feeling at all. Some bands seem to strive at delivering hours worth of bone dry technical wankery, with not a single interesting hook to be found anywhere in the mix (this has nothing to do with Intervals btw, I've veered off from that). This is a problem I hear with a lot of the programmed stuff coming from many of the 'djent' bands I'll hear occasionally (also a problem with prog bands like Dream Theater late in their careers, too bad all their albums can't just sound like Images and Words). These albums might be highly complex and technical, but damn sometimes I just want hear at least one good riff.   This isn't a complaint as djent as a whole, but meant to simply illustrate why I have trouble connecting with some of it in a broader sense. I love technical music, math metal, prog, whatever you want to call any of it, but it's got to have some groove to it. It needs to have songwriters and performers behind it trying to share something they think sounds pretty fucking cool, not just technically impressive. It makes a difference."
Djent,2zxw2m,dudebro_fistbump,2,Mon Mar 23 10:31:27 2015 UTC,"Oh well I was just wondering because Anup is the drummer in Intervals. Also, they don't have a vocalist anymore. You should listen to their first two EPs (instrumental) and they're re-releasing A Voice Within without the vocals. I just think they have a perfect blend of punchy riffs and catchy guitar melodies that aren't overly flashy and manage to sound extremely well composed."
Djent,2zxw2m,Groovemach,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:45:18 2015 UTC,"Yea, like I mentioned I might want to delve into their instrumental stuff, because my only experience with them was the stuff with the singer, and it wasn't working for me. Although I love the occasional instrumental track, it isn't often that I can listen to a whole album's worth in a row, and I typically listen to albums at a time, rather than randomize my playlists.   I'll look up their prior eps"
Djent,2zxw2m,MidtermMassacre,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:19:44 2015 UTC,Also just want to say that Anup only does the the drums for his solo project (Anup Sastry) the guitars are 100% programmed because he's not a fluent player
Djent,2zxw2m,joesaladmen,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:47:04 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, I can't get enough of the vocals on ""A Voice Within"" (I'm listening now, haha). But different tastes are good.  I second what Groovemach suggested: the first 2 Intervals albums are good stuff.  The instrumental-only version of ""A Voice Within"" just popped up on my Google Play page so that's there if you'd like to check it, too.  That said, I totally agree with your point on music needing soul.  I want music to make me really feel something, not just be technical mastery.  In band we focused on the technicality but never, everrrr forgot to add the musicality in as well.  It's so important and you don't realize it till it's missing."

I don't view djent as something one needs to work their way up to, but rather, depending on ones understanding of music they might have a different appreciation for the technicality or oddities of the composition. That being said, anyone can appreciate djent, if its something that is pleasing to the listeners ears. What's after djent is the next piece of music you listen to, whether that composition is 100 years old or a new release, it will be new to your ears. I think music will see more use of extended range instruments, think 11 string guitars, 9 string bass etc."
Djent,2zxw2m,dmatt1024,2,Sun Mar 22 22:51:19 2015 UTC,"Hi, know I'm a few months late but 21 here, and a lifelong metalhead. I've loved reading everyone's comments in these threads.   So before I get into djent, here was my basic metal education (from about the age of 7-8 with my Dad listening to LZ, Black Sabbath, Ozzy, Scorpions, etc.):  Symphonic Metal: (My ""gateway"" into metal)   Nightwish, Sonata Artica, Symphony X, Kamelot, etc. What I loved about symphonic metal was the musicianship and the songwriting, sometimes the lyrics are stupid yadiyada but I find myself (even now listening to hard crap like Dimmu Borgir) going back to symphonic metal for the beautiful and complex genre it is.   Black/Satanic Metal/Death Metal: Inspired by a friend, started listening to Dimmu Borgir and fell in love. Not that I align with their stance or anything but literally love the storytelling and anger. Brutal Stuff. Other bands I love: Amon Amarth, Burzum, Borknagar, etc.  Progressive Metal: Ok now this is where I know I'm going to get some flak but Dream Theater, Dream Theater, Dream Theater. My favorite band over the last 10+ years. Say what you want about James LaBrie (yes I do agree his vocals detract from the music at points), but the pure musicianship and technicality of this band is unmatched. I know that this is also a reason people don't like this band, but because I, myself, play multiple instruments I gain enormous inspiration from what Pertrucci and Myung in particular are doing. I also, through DT, began to love the 'concept album' idea (ex. Scenes from a Memory - if you want to have an amazing beginning to end experience listen to this album, even my ""omg i love Ed Sheeran"" gf LOVES this album (and that's saying a lot because she turns the radio in my car off sometimes when i play Volumes (the band) at like 3/40 volume haha.  Other prog bands I eff with: BtBaM, Liquid Tension Experiment (obvy DT), Planet X, Shadow Gallery, Tool, Trivium  Metalcore/Speed Metal/Death Core: After prog metal, my attention turned into absolutely brutal stuff (heavy vocals, low pitched guitars, stuff that literally blocks your capacity to think because you're like 'ok ok ok feeling this... DAAAAAMN') - not all of the band below are this way, but here's a favorite list of mine. August Burns Red, Killswitch Engage, A7x, As I Lay Dying, Atreyu, BfMV, At the Gates, Chelsea Grin, Whitechapel, Suicide Silence.  Okay now Djent: So kinda discovered Djent late 2013/early 2014 (don't remember), anyway went to a Volumes concert and was blown away. I know Volumes doesn't show up a lot on people's favorite list for Djent, but f*** they are heavy. Lyrics are dumb at points, but I fell in love with them because after the concert I understood where they are coming from and they are emotional and heavy af. Songs to listen to: Vahle, Pistol Play, Across the Bed, Peace of Mind/Up all Night, Via, and my personal favorite: INTAKE, friggen beautiful piece of music.  Other Djent bands I'm listening to (even right as I'm typing this:)  Animals as Leaders (thanks r/djent for directing me to the trio, friggen phenominal songwriting, and I LOVE that it doesn't need lyrics to convey the ups and downs and twists and turns of the complexity that is Animals as Leaders. Also seeing them Aug7 in winston salem! anyone?? Other Djent: Erra, TesseracT, Structures, Northlane (ehh not so much but still good), Sikth, and now Periphery.   Sorry for the length, just dig this community. Keep rockin."

I've had some fun with the bands that are purely ""djent"" (I have in mind the first albums from those I listed above as well as bands like Monuments, Volumes).  I don't know if there's a natural ""next step"" but I do find myself enjoying different types of metal now.  I used to hate growling/screaming vocals, but now I find that they add something when used right (just like any musical styling).  So rather than thinking of something that should come next, you may want to backtrack to things that you were on the fence about before.  Your opinions might have changed.    Just because I like sharing my personal experiences for people to benefit from, I'll say that I was a huge prog-metal nerd before encountering djent (meaning that I was very into Dream Theater, Tool, and Porcupine Tree).  After my introduction to djent, I felt more comfortable with heavier prog metal and with prog metal that made use of this wonderful djenty stuff (TesseracT, Sithu Aye, etc).    I encourage you to explore more prog metal if that's what works for you.  I'd be happy to give you recommendations if you have a particular direction you'd like to go (or not)."

I listened to Totlamad and Icarus Lives endlessly on holiday to America when I was 18. Travelled down from Michigan to Tenessee with these and various other demos blasting in the car.  I miss that old Pod sound. :(  Nowa days all these newer bands go for that boxy tone that Periphery used on their first album (which I hate to say, but I was pretty disappointed with). Their newer stuff is great, but it strays a bit from Bulb's roots in my opinion.  Compare this to this and you'll probably understand where I'm coming from.  I loved the presence/attack of the earlier stuff, which is why I tend to lean more towards Monuments as one of my go to band for cool riffs. And not to mention Tesseract's One and AAL's first album for their not-give-a-fuck attitude about how much the guitars completely nail the treble and mids."

When I listened I always yearned for more technicality and more kind of groovy riffs which I was always searching for. I would say I got into mastodon, despised icon, BTBAM, and always had a soft spot for Dream theater. But probably when I was about 20 I got into the real proggy stuff. I accredit much of it to Born of Osiris' The New Reign and The discovery albums. It then moved to discovering Structures/Volumes/Veil of Maya/Periphery and here we are. Huge fan of instrumental stuff now like Anup, Intervals, Polyphia, AAL. And I couldn't be happier with my music taste now."

Djent,2zudns,tumtadiddlydoo,2,Sun Mar 22 12:37:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not against cleans, but I think that's going a bit far. The technicality of the instruments is what really defined them and made them stand out, and I certainly enjoyed Eclipse as it pushed further to a more progressive and well-produced sound, but I just don't understand the hate for blast beats...It's really what makes (or possibly made) them unique. I'm hoping they including the ""thrashy blast beat crap"" but continue with a more progressive sound that experiments with other genre traits. If you don't enjoy their technicality, and want them to include more cleans, then there are a few hundred other bands just like that."
Djent,2zudns,Animals_As_Ben,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:28:14 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that blast beats are bad, rather they can be over used, just like anything else. Yeah, by over using them it helped set them apart for people who just want 158% heavy all the time, but even most metal heads can't listen to VoM without getting a head ache after awhile.   While i do like some old songs by them in moderation, I like new VoM songs without even having to ""warm up"" to them. To me, that is a sign of a mature sound- and band."

I'll still listen to it and probably get it though. A common man's collapse will always be my number one though. I wish they would make more albums like that.

I don't understand how a band that has been so consistently amazing can reach the kind of pinnacle that they did with Eclipse – where consummate musicianship meets the utmost in audio engineering – and then decide to take the whole thing and run it off the rails.

Djent,2zllk3,DrewsifStalin,4,Thu Mar 19 16:34:46 2015 UTC,"Great stuff as usual, I'm hyped for the album release! The guest solo is great and the ending is really powerful.  I must admit I'm confused regarding what exactly we (the public) know about the album. I'm just going to list off a bunch of stuff I'm confused about and feel free to answer any combination of them that you'd like (or none at all).   The obvious question, when's the release date? Alternatively, when's the release date's release date? What's the tracklist? How long is the album's run time? Will Nikki appear in the album? Are there any other guest solos (or even vocals) appearing in the album?   Thanks for reading, and sorry for bombarding you with questions you've probably heard many times before :)"
Djent,2zllk3,Raine94,7,Thu Mar 19 17:26:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the love dude! I'm still a bit rocky on the release date, given I've got a fair amount to prepare first, can't comment on that one :/  Tracklist will come soon with the release date :P  The run time is roughly 60 minutes, give or take a few  Nikki will indeed appear!  There is one more guest solo from a friend of mine, and one more all but confirmed/tracked. And guest vocals from my pals Tim/Nikki (obviously as stated earlier)  thanks a lot for taking an interest, my friend! I'm sorry a lot is still up in the air, it's quite a feat to take on Writing/Recording/Graphic Design/Merch/Videography... essentially everything! As far as now is concerned, new songs will continue to come out every thursday!"
Djent,2zllk3,Raine94,3,Thu Mar 19 21:55:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  I'm surprised so much goes into the release date, it feels like everything is done if you're able to release a track every week! Though having said that, I've never released an album, so I'm sure there's much left to do.  No need to apologize, just keep on continuing producing the great stuff you've made so far in your own time and we'll be more than satisfied!"
Djent,2zllk3,Shadow190085,2,Thu Mar 19 22:30:36 2015 UTC,"Will there be an instrumental version? I like the feel to it, however i personally do not find vocals in general and these types of vocals suiting towards my preference."

The ending and the solo are both fantastic as Raine pointed out, but something about the vocals seems off to me. I don't know if it has to do with the mastering or something else. Regardless, I look forward to hearing the entire album when it is released!"

Djent,2zo6fo,kindodeku4,11,Fri Mar 20 05:28:23 2015 UTC,You can't compare meshuggah with periphery or volumes. They play a different style of music and that pretty fucking well. Just not your type of music i guess.
Djent,2zo6fo,thebananabob,3,Fri Mar 20 06:31:00 2015 UTC,"you could say bands like Periphery / Volumes etc. play a sub-genre of Djent which includes more melodic / metalcore tendencies along with the odd time signatures. while Meshuggah is just straight odd time signatures, harsh vox, and low tuned instruments - which i'd say they do quite well"
Djent,2zo6fo,MatticusXII,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:26:07 2015 UTC,exactly. does this subgenre thing ever stop ? as we´re already a sub sub sub sub genre of watever the fuck.
Djent,2zo6fo,thebananabob,2,Fri Mar 20 17:43:31 2015 UTC,"it won't. but i guess it's the best way to explain the specific sound a band has, so if periphery added synth. they would be symphonic melodic djent lol"

Djent,2zo6fo,Not_KGB,-1,Sat Mar 21 00:52:54 2015 UTC,Albums??? You think I could listen to a whole album of Meshuggah songs? That would seem more like work than enjoyment. I have heard songs from Ozben and Catch Thirty-Three.

If its not enjoyable I'm gonna fucking force myself to listen to it, because most likely I'll hate the band more and still think they are boring. Is that what you do? ""People really like this band and I don't understand why they do."" ""I'm just gonna listen to their whole discography nonstop, even though I don't know one good song that I've heard... Oh Well!""

Djent,2zo6fo,snailboy,3,Fri Mar 20 09:38:59 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that you like the genre. I'm going to see Periphery in May and couldn't be more excited! Your assessment however, is as poorly put as you claim the band is. I'm no die-hard Meshuggah fan, though do I enjoy their music. I first saw them open for Tool in 2002 and it blew my mind. Music progresses and evolves, and to say that Meshuggah is ""just kinda sad"" is along the lines of saying that Jimi Hendrix only did lazy, played-out riffs. Then again, you're probably never heard of him."
Djent,2zo6fo,IsaacJDean,0,Fri Mar 20 06:26:25 2015 UTC,"Even if their riffs are amazing, they use them very poorly. I've found that most Meshuggah songs are just one riff for a majority of the song, and it gets annoying and boring to listen too because it just keeps looping with different lyrics( I for one care more for the music and less for lyrics), so you can see the reason why they do not appeal to me as much as the younger bands who do a lot of things to keep me interested, like have choruses(does Meshuggah do chourses???). And yes I know who Jimi Hendrix is I'm not fucking dolt."

They aren't trying to please your ears, they are trying to accomplish something else entirely.  For that reason, you have to really listen hard.    I didn't like them either for quite a while, but every once in a while, maybe once or twice a month, I'd go listen to a song.  Maybe sit through an album.  Really try hard to find something I liked about them.  After a while I began to understand their music.  I won't say I am now a big fan or anything, but I did find some things I liked.  Rational Gaze off the album Nothing is pretty awesome.  All of it takes some ear tuning, though, so if you really want to understand Meshuggah, be prepared for that."
Djent,2zo6fo,Groovemach,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:19:05 2015 UTC,"I understand the logic of going back and giving them a try. I have done that,, and waited till I finally understood the band musically.

Djent,2zo6fo,Williebob,2,Sat Mar 21 07:36:28 2015 UTC,"That's me with Periphery or Animals as Leaders. There's a few riffs I LOVE from the new Periphery album, but I dislike the vocals and overall feel of most of the songs. I do like Icarus Lives! (the instrumental version), but their stuff sounds too unfocused to me, which is the same complaint I have with AAL. There's not a strong groove to it, and not enough cohesive sound to flow from section to section, just overlapping melodies focused on speed and technique rather than rhythm and groove."

At least not in the same way it did 1-2 years ago. It's mostly just a mix of post-rock/deathcore/prog acts that happen to pique a certain age groups interests."
Djent,2zir5s,MatticusXII,3,Wed Mar 18 22:29:01 2015 UTC,One of the first bands to get me into the whole djent scene. I was coming from listening to mostly deathcore those days so their mix of heavy of with space theme and grooves were just perfect for me at the time.

Djent,2zazyl,jaimeyeah,6,Tue Mar 17 02:04:33 2015 UTC,"It definitely has some kind of effect on my listening experience.   Lyrics have made some bands (like Attila) much harder for me to 'get into', while they've made other bands (like Silent Planet) much more enjoyable, and I think it's the same across most, if not all, genres.   I actually still would like both these bands without their lyrics, but the meaning and message either tends to pull me in, or push me away. Especially when it's a band I already enjoy, and I take the time to read the lyrics, and find that they speak to me. It makes listening a much more personal (and enjoyable) experience."

Djent,2zazyl,bajster,3,Tue Mar 17 15:35:23 2015 UTC,"Lyrics are always the last thing i listen to. when you think about it, you've got 2 guitars, drums, bass, vocals. so the vocals are 1/5 of the overall sound, and the lyrics (if vocals are half lyrics, half melody) are 1/10 of the sound.  They matter zilch to me unless they're really, REALLY hard hitting"
Djent,2zazyl,DuexTrios,1 point,Tue Mar 17 12:48:19 2015 UTC,I disagree I'd say for most people vocals equal more than 1/5 of the overall sound. When someone listens to music unless they're critiquing it or they have an ear for sound they mostly listen to only the lead guitar and vocals and maybe occasionally the drums. The bass and rhythm guitar and much harder to notice when you listen to music leisurely.
Djent,2zazyl,killaj2006,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:37:48 2015 UTC,"Most people, sure. Most people also listen to basic shit on the radio. I'd say a good portion of djent/progmetal fans are musicians themselves and go out of their way to notice all the intricacies of a song. Especially when some of the better djent albums have a heavy focus on making everyone audible.   Then again, I know I go out of my way for that stuff, and I have a guitarist buddy who doesn't pay attention to drums ever, so its entirely situationally dependant. But in this genre, I'd be willing to bet that lyrics aren't the first thing most people focus on."

The problem i have with most popular music is that EVERYTHING is sacrificed and gutted so the singer stands out.  70/80% of the focus goes to what should be 1/5th of the sound, and everything else suffers.  Djent doesn't have that problem.  Even in -core bands, as soon as the singer opens his mouth for the chorus the guitars switch to powerchords and the drummer pulls back.  Now a band like Tesseract will keep that shit going and not sacrifice anything.  Tesseract makes me happy :)"

Djent,2zazyl,SailorLax10,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:18:16 2015 UTC,"There's a part of music that feels - to me - like it can communicate something different to words.  I find that much more interesting - infact I'm very nearly never interested in the specific things artists have to say. It's usually a shame to me that music ends up tethered to a specific 'message'. Music without words is something different, I think.  The music is expressive in-and-of-itself, rather than merely as a supporting part of a lyrical message.  As for bands with lyrics that don't live up to the names - there will always be bands who like certain tropes of genres and will therefore do them because it's 'the done thing' rather than because they have any key message that is unique to them. There will always be bands with awful metal names."
Djent,2zazyl,kindodeku4,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:45:50 2015 UTC,"Lyrics can take a band to the next level, but they don't break a band for me. It is very much secondary.

I saw them when they were on tour with the new guy, so I just have a hope the new album will be to my liking.   Check out Invent, Animate if you dig the sounds.

I don't have personal experience with Legators but Ive heard good things about their 350 and 400 series guitars. Personally, I would scour the Gear Exchange group on FB and try to find something on the used market in your price range. You could easily find an older MIJ Ibanez RG7420 in the $350-400 range. Keep saving and you could find a used Ibby Prestige 1527 for $750 or so. If you're just looking for a beater/backup though, I'm sure the Legator would suit that need."

Djent,2z772r,jrodb92,2,Mon Mar 16 08:18:40 2015 UTC,I agree. Some mids will also help with the definition on the lower string chugs. Sounds a bit muddy(?). Could also be the amount of gain.

Centuries Apart (Not sure if 'djent' again, but very technical, guitar-based core music. Worth checking out.) David Maxim Micic (The guitarist for Destiny Potato's side project, pretty unique. Not very heavy) Destiny Potato (I've heard them referred to as ""Periphery with a female vocalist"". Good stuff, sometimes fairly heavy.) Erra (Arguably djent or not, but I couldn't leave this band out. Definitely my aoty from 2014, their album 'Augment' is mind-blowing.) Intervals (Mostly instrumental, except for their last album, these guys are a huge part of the genre) The Afterimage (Another arguably djent band, these guys have only put out a few songs but still manage to be amazing.) Volumes (Pretty heavy band, these guys were one of the first on the djent bandwagon back in the day) Within The Ruins (Very guitar-focuses, these guys are awesome)   This is in no way a comprehensive list, just a couple bands I really enjoy.

Djent,2z0twj,TranscendTheIllusion,6,Sat Mar 14 14:52:17 2015 UTC,"Pi was written and recorded only a few days before the completion of the Master copy, at around 10 am, with a couple of serious hangovers. Justin and I had talked about having a classical guitar intro (Antonio Lauro -Maria Carolina) into some sort of heavier riffage, but we weren't quite sure what that was exactly going to be.    We remembered back to a few weeks prior, when we were throwing around an idea of using the mathematical constant Pi, and incorporating it into some sort of complex breakdown pattern where the kick drum corresponded to each number as the figure progressed. Kinda creating the ultimate mind boggler of a riff. The complexity of the intro is often overheard, because it's hard to discern what is actually going on within the track, UNTIL NOW!!!    Here's a breakdown of the....um, breakdown, in the intro to our album, ""Pi: The Mercury God Of Infinity""    The actual tempo is 120 beats per minute (bpm).   You can hear this by listening for the closed hi-hat that is panned left: it is playing constant eighth-notes.    The snare is on beat three in 4/4 time at 120 bpm.    A crash cymbal accents beat one of the first measure in 4/4. It is repeated every four measures.  Now this is where it gets tricky: the china cymbal.   It's hard to feel the breakdown in Pi at 120 bpm, and this is mostly due to the china cymbal, which is playing a 4 over 3 (4/3) dotted-eighth note ostinato that begins on the ""E"" of one.    Confused?    Check it out: A quarter note is equal to one beat in 4/4 time, but so are two eighth notes, or 4 sixteenth notes. It's all about subdividing note values.    When you count a measure of 4/4 in quarter notes, it's: 1, 2, 3, 4.   When counting in eighth notes, it's: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +. (a plus sign refers to the spoken count ""and"" ex. ""One and two and three and four and"")   When counting in sixteenths, it's: 1 E + A 2 E + A 3 E + A 4 E + A. (Spoken: ""One e and a two e and a three e and a four e and a)  So when I say the china starts on the ""E"" of one, I'm referring to the spoken counting value assigned to the second 16th note in a quarter note duration.    A dotted eighth note is a duration of three 16th notes, an ostinato is a persistently repeated pattern. Basically, the china plays on the bold-capitalized letters:    one E and a TWO e and A three e AND a four E and a ONE e and A etc.    Starting to get it?   Cool.    At last, the reason Pi is what it is: the Double-bass pattern.    The formula of Pi for the kick drum was pretty far fetched at first, but seemed to work well once the track was finished. The numbers and rests in the formula translate to 16th notes on the kick drum, and 16th note rests. There is no kick drum beats where there are snare drums. Sooo, here it is:    With the decimal point BEFORE the number, and starting with the first number, move that many decimal points to the right and insert that many 16th note rests. Use one 16th note rest to divide the numbers you passed (when applicable). Continue on throughout the rest of the figure. No repeats.    So basically for the first step, you'd place the point (pt) before the first number, three: (pt)3.14159265    Next you jump the decimal three points to the right: 3.14(pt)159265    That's where you insert three 16th rests, and insert one 16th note rest between the other numbers you passed: 3(16th rest)1(16th rest)4(dotted-eighth)159265    Now, your decimal lies in between the 4 and the 1. So, following the formula, you move one point to the right of the 1 and insert one 16th note rest. There are no numbers to separate with single 16th rests, so you move onto the next number, which is 5, and follow the same instructions.    That's all there is to it! The formula extends out to 71 decimal points    Oh, and by the way...there's an extra special secret buried within the song that will be up to YOU to figure out :)    Enjoy.    -Trent    UPDATE: The ""Pi"" section of the song has now been re-recorded 6 years later, and with the new extension it brings the grand total of decimal points to 110."

Djent,2yx0o8,FaceTron,2,Fri Mar 13 16:59:22 2015 UTC,I think perpetual black second would feel pretty badass to play on rock band.
Djent,2yx0o8,stoned-derelict,6,Sat Mar 14 22:19:28 2015 UTC,You can download Bleed from the RBN. It isn't that hard as long as you can play the rhythm.

Djent,2yz1bf,timesloth,2,Sat Mar 14 00:54:29 2015 UTC,"Sounds solid, Only criticism is the snare seems to be cutting through the mix a little too much... I think its a great snare sound, it just feel its a little over bearing at times.   Edit: that said it could just be my shitty speakers, I'm away from my usual setup and dont have any good headphones with me either. Take my comment as a grain of salt."

Djent,2yuv1k,burner706,3,Fri Mar 13 05:06:34 2015 UTC,"I LOVED it and I think it's super relevant. Misha is practically a godfather of djent, so anything relating to him seems like a fair thing to post."

Maybe it's the fact that you paired a use of the software with a style I'm familiar with, but I enjoyed watching these a lot more than the usual software tutorial and it motivated me to play around in PS again.

Djent,2ytorw,lotkrotan,3,Thu Mar 12 22:07:12 2015 UTC,"but I feel like it really doesn't belong in this sub   This sub doesn't have any defined rules and these posts aren't against site wide rules, so reporting it to mods isn't really appropriate.  In these cases, it's just best to vote, comment, and/or move on.   If the community doesn't like the content, the voting system bumps it off the sub's frontpages real quick and it'll disappear into the abyss of downvoted posts.  But if the community votes it up and the posts generate positive discussion/activity in this subreddit (which is quite small and niche as it is), then what's the harm in keeping it?"

Djent,2ytorw,Adamapplejacks,1 point,Thu Mar 12 23:38:16 2015 UTC,I asked two questions. I see no anger in either. Why are you so offended that I'm asking those two questions?
Djent,2yu3p9,tptwizard,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:47:33 2015 UTC,"You're definitely starting off in the right direction; the recordings sound good!  IMO, too many double bass blasts. Guitars are kind of tinny, drums sound super fake. But, don't be sad! You are making music! Keep working, work with effects, EQ's, sitting instruments in the mix, you'll be Misha in no time."
Djent,2yu3p9,burner706,2,Fri Mar 13 13:36:16 2015 UTC,"Half of the fake sounding drums problem can be fixed by simply using superior drummer or addictive drums. They make use of real drum samples which helps. To add realism, use EQ and compression and change the volumes of different hits. Don't make every kick and snare exactly the same. It's a small difference but you can just tell when it's a computer. Most DAWs also will have a humanize option if you wanna go that far. This simply moves certain huts very slightly so the timing is not perfect. Just because no drummer, not even Ringo Starr, is capable of absolutely perfect timing. But this is not a priority. The average person (including me) won't be able to tell if the drums are humanized or not."

Like just explaining what you're doing as you're doing it or something. That would be really cool and I feel like a lot of people would dig it.  A step by step or something!
Djent,2yr7bq,meknoy,2,Thu Mar 12 05:27:22 2015 UTC,"I second that and would love a more step by step / thought out loud process of what you're doing.  These videos are great thank you for doing them. But they are very fast, and I gotta keep pausing and starting whilst trying to figure out the tools being used. I loved the shortcut of you copying then pasting, to create the patterns of an item going round and round. But I couldn't figure out how on earth you did that :| haha!!"

Djent,2yjy7y,OrderlyToaster,8,Tue Mar 10 13:04:45 2015 UTC,Absolutely unbelievable effort. This may just be my favorite release from him so far.
Djent,2yjy7y,taylorj474,7,Tue Mar 10 14:19:23 2015 UTC,"Alone this is a fantastic EP, but in the context of the entire trilogy it's downright brilliant. I love the recurring motifs in Paper Moon, and how it ends the same way it began, with a ticking heartbeat."

Djent,2ygqba,EverythingInTransit,2,Mon Mar 9 21:46:47 2015 UTC,They haven't changed vocalist have they? I thought it'd been the same guy.   Regardless I'm pumped to finally put all three eps together
Djent,2ygqba,Bmajor7th,3,Mon Mar 9 21:53:34 2015 UTC,"I had no idea they had released so much music.  I haven't heard them since the eye album and the vocalist turned me off then.   No idea if its the same guy, if so he's improved (obligatory IMO).   Time to listen to all 3 of their newest albums. Woo!"
Djent,2ygqba,EverythingInTransit,2,Mon Mar 9 22:01:08 2015 UTC,"Understandable! Assuming spirit of metal is correct, it's the same guy. I've loved the sound of the vocalist since their first ep. Now that all three are out its a perfect time to listen to them all! I always thought their eps would have been better being released as a full album, but I suppose I can't complain anymore!"
Djent,2ygqba,Bmajor7th,2,Mon Mar 9 22:05:32 2015 UTC,This is my absolute favorite release from them!

Djent,2yecu1,KingSchubert,2,Mon Mar 9 20:40:09 2015 UTC,"http://kubbi.bandcamp.com  Really awesome chiptune, and its all free. His newer stuff is more ambient and airy, his older stuff is straight up chiptunes. He throws in a few guitars occasionally too, which is pretty cool. I recommend 'Ember', the 'Gas Powered EP' and the compilation 'Singles 2012' to start you off."

Djent,2yecu1,emywox,3,Mon Mar 9 22:52:34 2015 UTC,"I rarely comment on stuff like this, but I'm the guy who played this track about 10 times straight this morning.   You have some serious compositional talent (I'm a Music professor and I coach budding composers every day). I believe you have a real gift for this - please keep writing and releasing your music!  And definitely keep open sourcing the tabs!"
Djent,2yecu1,emywox,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:33:35 2015 UTC,"pow, thats some high praise.  Thanks!  Now you gotta tell me your secrets of musical composition, because I have had little exposure to music theory and composition beyond how to name 7th chords.  I know scales, intervals, modes, chords, time sigs, and the word sibilance.  The rest of what I know is the result of experiment and being highly critical of my music.  What do you tell people regarding process and whatnot?  I'm always looking for new tricks and interesting things!  I struggle in particular maintaining consistent levels of productivity."
Djent,2yecu1,Soul_Rage,2,Mon Mar 9 20:45:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I wouldn't want to say too much, because I wouldn't really change your process very much at all considering the music you're already writing.  My biggest piece of advice would be to ""follow your ear"" and trust that the music you hear in your head will also be enjoyable to others.  Beyond the basic music theory concepts you listed, I'm not sure there's a whole lot else that would do you much good at this point. A reliance on theory and process is for people with minimal gifts, to help coax listenable music out of them. Yes, theory is useful for when you've painted yourself into a corner harmonically or when you are trying to figure out options for soloing, etc, but I wouldn't get too hung up on it.  I don't want to dodge your question entirely though, so I'll try to point you in an interesting direction. Look into modulation and pivot chords. Unexpected modulations can add a lot of color to music and keep the listener on their toes. I think more modulation could make your music even more exciting than it already is.  Congrats again!"
Djent,2yecu1,Soul_Rage,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:55:22 2015 UTC,"Hm.  Modulation huh.  And I suppose pivot chords are the ones to do it on?  Yes, this is an excellent suggestion, thank you!  I've only been able to accomplish this somewhat clumsily.  I do this mid solo in a song I never finished, (here is the GP5), and thats probably the most advanced example I can give of me toying with doing that.  Its basically a direct copy of the mechanic used in Dream Theater's Constant Motion to switch keys between guitar and keyboard solos. If you give that a listen (sorry, I only really have the .gp5 of it, and the song itself is now ancient), you might also notice that I cannibalized a part or two for I, Betrayer, heh.  I see precisely what you mean about the rules of music theory composition being somewhat limiting, but useful when cornered.  But it is also good to hear that I'm not missing too many important concepts, at least for the communication of what I've written to musicians I'm working with.  Now I get to set off with the goal of the next EBEM song to implement some modulation in a way that doesn't suck!  Thanks a lot!"
Djent,2yecu1,obsydianx,3,Mon Mar 9 21:07:02 2015 UTC,good lord i need the chip tune in a download. i have your other djent one. i really wanna see some talented musicians bring this to life with real instruments and see how crushing this would be. like put the drums in ez drummer or toontrack. and axe fx 2 the guitars and bass. would sound so cash

Djent,2y7w1s,TobyPete,8,Sat Mar 7 06:13:41 2015 UTC,"You're suffering from ear fatigue. Take a break, a solid day, even two. Then come back to it and try again.  The reason I say this is that your mix sounds pretty much exactly like the original. Your bass guitar is more solid and bassy whereas nolly's tone seems more mid focused in comparison.  The only thing I can hear is your cymbals are primarily in the right ear in the clip of the song you put up. Your panning might sound great in the other parts of the song but play with automation to get the primary cymbal closer to the center so it's less distracting and more additive to the overall sound.  Disclaimer: Mixing is subjective and there are no right or wrong answers. Don't downvote me.  EDIT: I didn't answer your original question. It sounds just as huge as the original!"
Djent,2y7w1s,MildlyMoist,2,Sat Mar 7 13:34:29 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't downvote that response, thanks for the tips and feedback :)"
Djent,2y7w1s,CoffeeScentedUrine,3,Sat Mar 7 14:31:37 2015 UTC,My opinion: drums reverb sounds a little bit too 'big room'ish.  And how did you pan the guitars?

Djent,2y7w1s,Gunnnar,1 point,Sat Mar 7 14:26:50 2015 UTC,"Is it a mastering thing that can be contributing to it not being as full? Or anything in my mix that stands out a lot that could be limiting it that people can hear.  I think the snare could feel ""wider""?"
Djent,2y7w1s,THEDAWNISYOURENEMY,1 point,Sat Mar 7 06:15:23 2015 UTC,"The snare needs a nicer, bigger reverb. Make sure it's on an fx/send channel and try use a shorter ""bigger"" reverb time. and maybe even put a Stereo Imager on it. Also boost the ""snappy"" frequencies. It should be around 2-4khz"
Djent,2y7w1s,RyanStroedeSkating,1 point,Sat Mar 7 17:16:14 2015 UTC,I think you need more sub bass on your bass guitar. Did you quad track the guitars?
Djent,2y7w1s,RyanStroedeSkating,1 point,Sat Mar 7 08:59:56 2015 UTC,Im not an expert on mixing but to me it sounds your missing a few layers for the guitar tracks as /U/CoffeeScentedUrine had said
Djent,2y7w1s,IAmMySon,1 point,Sun Mar 8 08:16:04 2015 UTC,I can assure you that I have double tracked the rhythms and this is what they have done on the record. I think the guitars could be louder though.

Altered State was one of my favorite albums of 2013, but there was always something slightly off and I truly believe that it was Dan's unique sound that would have made the difference. Perfect blend of melodic singing, melodic screaming. Words cannot describe how elated I am to see him back with the band, now my only hope is that they tour my part of United States soon!"
Djent,2y128r,BigKahunaBgr,7,Thu Mar 5 15:35:06 2015 UTC,"With groups where an 8 string guitar is tuned down to E (the same octave as the bass guitar's E, mind you), the bass plays in standard tuning.  A 5 string bass would definitely cover it, but it's not necessary."
Djent,2y128r,three_three_fourteen,3,Thu Mar 5 16:28:31 2015 UTC,Wow. I learn something new everyday. Could you give me some artists that do something similar to this so I could take a listen? Thanks!
Djent,2y128r,three_three_fourteen,8,Thu Mar 5 16:33:15 2015 UTC,"I saw a video with Meshuggah's guitar tech where they took a tour of all their equipment and he confirmed that the basses are all just in standard tuning.  Found the video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAFJmgA2G5E&t=436  I also do it with my own music:  www.soundcloud.com/everbeast – it's all pretty rough mixes, and (most, not all) the bass is done with the Kontakt instrument Scarbee Jay Bass  I am not absolutely sure of anyone else doing this – but when you think about it – there's not much else they can do, really. Having a string playing an octave below E1 (the low E on a bass or a downtuned 8 string guitar) is pretty nuts and would be muddy as hell; and also doesn't really serve the purpose of the bass in a rock band:  The idea behind the bass guitar is that you want the low end backing up and filling in the spectrum. A lot of people overestimate the guitar in the sense that they think it's the primary, uh, sound making up the band, when in reality, the guitar has its real body in the mid to high mid range – leaving all the ""body feeling,"" bass-end of the spectrum empty. The guitar doesn't really have very much low end, and the bass is what gives the real power of rock and roll.   But when you have a guitar that goes down into the bass register, then you don't necessarily need the bass to make up for what sound the guitar can't physically produce anymore; you want it to have a clean, undistorted sound that supports the ultra distorted guitars that 8 strings are popular for.  It's like in electronic music production and the concept of layering. If you make a synth that has a really cool, say, lead sound, but has no low end, you wouldn't hesitate to add a clean sine sub bass underneath it. The bass guitar performs the same function with extended range guitars and, to a different end, with regular guitars as well."
Djent,2y128r,Thegreatedd,5,Thu Mar 5 17:04:01 2015 UTC,"Keely just released a bass comp which I've heard is really good, though I haven't yet tried it my self. Nolly uses a Cali76 comp which is the best one for bass I've heard, but they're pretty expensive.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMxbP1V3WBo"
Djent,2y128r,powerfat,2,Thu Mar 5 18:31:46 2015 UTC,I'm interested in the new Keely. It's only $40 cheaper then the Cali76 tho. It's not marketed as a bass compressor but when I reached out to keely the assured me it can be used in studio situations for any instrument without lowing and low end. They mentioned it works for kickdrums as well.
Djent,2y128r,OrderlyToaster,3,Thu Mar 5 19:31:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say that most bands bands play in either drop A (AEADG) or drop A flat (AbEbAbDbGb). A dingwall would be great for what you want, but I hope you know they are >$2000. If you got the P bass you'd have to order online to get an individual string thick enough to handle the tuning, since .135 is the largest you can get in a store-bought pack and is not enough in my experience."
Djent,2y128r,deadmanRise,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:27:11 2015 UTC,Yes dingwall has a high price tag. But it's time for me to upgrade regardless.  Drop A flat sounds like I could just leave it set to standard BEADG with just heavier then normal strings.  Thanks for the input.
Djent,2y128r,downtap,3,Thu Mar 5 16:32:31 2015 UTC,"A new band coming out called Extinction Level Event uses strictly bass guitars. I think they tune in standard, but regardless, you might want to check them out."
Djent,2y128r,TheRileyOBrien,1 point,Thu Mar 5 23:11:22 2015 UTC,"I believe I read on their Facebook page that they do use standard (they all plays 5-strings, mind you), but on their album that they're working on, they have the low B dropped to A."
Djent,2y128r,downtap,2,Fri Mar 6 04:10:36 2015 UTC,"Nolly from Periphery tunes way down on his Dingwall. I personally think custom Kalium strings are a must if you're going to do any type of drop-tuning. They have an amazing selection of sizes/scale lengths. Note that not all bridges can handle the thicker gauges. You may need to alter your bridge or replace it all together.  Lastly, to me, one thing that is consistent about that tone, is compression and drive. Get yourself a good compressor to even out your attack, and some sort of drive you can blend in. I recommend the Big Muff Deluxe, but there are quite a few options out there."

I've talked with Intervals over the past couple months and I unfortunately will not be their vocalist BUT I am in the process of putting together several original projects and will hopefully work with the guys from Intervals in some capacity in the future. They're awesome guys and I'll be supporting them either way, we'll see what the future holds.  While I put together these projects (which takes a long time; finding the right people and getting them all on the same page can be a real logistical nightmare) I will continue to put up covers or sing-throughs of my previous original work so there's plenty to look forward to.  If you ever want advice on vocal technique or even guitar related things, it's not my main instrument but I've been writing and recording albums with guitar for years, just let me know!"

As far as band names, we've had a lot of trouble deciding. We want something that is interesting and has meaning, but isn't some abstract sciency term like most other new bands of the djent/progressive genre. I think we'll wait until the EP is more complete to really worry about a name."
Djent,2xquw3,bhindblueiz,1 point,Tue Mar 3 11:50:00 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't release anything else that is 100% complete until there is a name behind it. I totally get where you are coming from, MAKE IT PLURAL THOUGH! Kidding. Sometimes something simple is perfect. My band went through 4 different names and 2 different bass players and one keyboardist later we have our name. And it's the simplest, one word, two syllables. We were fortunate enough to find one with little to no definition, so we could define it, plus we finally found one no ones using. Yet it is perfect.   Iscah (Yis-Kah) if you were curious.  It can be a long process, for sure. There's gotta be something you all like and can agree on and get behind. While it isn't important yet, I'd say definitely come together. I want to know what my next favorite band will be called. Also, are you guys just instrumental?"
Djent,2xquw3,greeksteve0317,2,Tue Mar 3 17:08:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions! For now we are working on instrumental songs, but if we can find someone whose vocals fit the genre and who lives close by with a decent stage presence, we would definitely add them to the already finished instrumentals. I agree, we should definitely have a name by the release of the EP, we're just still in the naming process at the moment."

Djent,2xmtij,PurestStrain0fHate,8,Mon Mar 2 03:49:09 2015 UTC,"Most of us djent bands started by learning some Meshuggah.  At it's most basic, what Meshuggah and all of the first-wave of djent bands do is write a guitar part in an odd-meter time signature (say in 5 or in 7), and play it over a 4/4 drum beat.  That way, what you get is the same guitar riff but placed at different points over the drum beat.  This makes your brain pop with glee because you're kinda aware that there are 2 patterns going on, and these patterns create such satisfying syncopation and groove. Then you basically make those odd-time guitar riffs longer and more complex.  So the first thing to do is to understand and learn how to play these kind of beats.  Keep it simple to begin with - start by writing a cool-sounding-but-easy riff in 7/4. Once you have a cool riff, turn to your computer and work out a kick-drum pattern that matches your guitar part.  Then add the straight 4/4 hi-hat and snare drum.  Then, LEARN.  Learn how to feel that guitar riff rolling over those drums.  'Internalise' all those grooves.  Eventually you reach a point where the whole thing is natural and you're grooving away in a 7-over-4 groove just fine.  Once you've got that, you can do what you like - make more complex riffs, change things up, start adding the ambient or the jazzy things than TesseracT or CHON add.  These are the more interesting bits - both bands add a whole additional layer of songwriting around their stuff that make them unique and exciting, and those guitar riffs are just a part of the puzzle."
Djent,2xmtij,Miroist,1 point,Mon Mar 2 11:27:10 2015 UTC,Thanks.  This is really helpful.
Djent,2xmtij,DeudeWTF,7,Mon Mar 2 16:46:50 2015 UTC,"What I've been doing and have been having decent success with is    Come up with a riff Play it over and over and over and over and over again accenting different notes on different beats Add a quick little lick/tremolo picking/sweep a few octaves up for some variation. (The coolest djent riffs imo make you go all over the neck to play them) Don't try to come up with an ""exquisite"" rhythm. Just let it come naturally. At some point you will be playing something and you will just ""get"" it if you catch my drift. HAVE FUN WITH IT. Super cliche, but writing riffs can become very frustrating if you try too hard. If you're really having a hard time go learn a song and just play around with the notes they use. You're bound to come up with something. Note choice is super important in this djenre."

Djent,2xmtij,emywox,2,Mon Mar 2 14:39:24 2015 UTC,"try to expand off from the 4/4 riffs, could be the first step. add random ""rests"" and notes together. Awkward timings where you want to throw notes in but have a slight off timing note or rest will work i guess."

I believe the tuning Vildhjarta uses is the first 6 strings are tuned in c standard, low to high C F B# E# G C﻿, and then the 7th string is C#1, the same note as the low string on a 9 string guitar."

Certain words fall off tempo, or in the case of this new track, the first note of clean vocals is out of key. It's a great track. Very different but it's fresh. I just wish the vocals were a little tighter."
Djent,2x0at9,Lympwing2,3,Tue Feb 24 17:21:15 2015 UTC,"Very nice! Heard snippets of Laythe on SoundCloud a while back, glad you've got a ""project"" going now. :D"
Djent,2x0at9,PradaLoci,2,Tue Feb 24 20:37:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've demo-ed Laythe a ridiculous amount of times. Like I keep wanting to change things. I'd say it's done, but now we're in the process of writing lyrics for it, so I guess it's not done."
Djent,2x0at9,KrebiGD,4,Tue Feb 24 22:10:39 2015 UTC,"Man that is outstanding quality, I love it. What I'm going to say next is going to be with the only intention of helping you. It's constructive criticism so don't take it as an offensive comment please.  I think you need to polish the image of the band, because your music is already very good but in this industry you can't only sound good, you need to look like a solid band.  Let me explain: The first impression when I opened your bandcamp page wasn't very good (people often have very little patience when surfing the net, so you need to catch their attention quickly.) The page didn't retain my attention (because of poor design and the fact that you even call yourselves ""not really a band"" in the bio... so by reading that, I know I can't expect much...) Since I didn't like the bandcamp page, the first thing I did was going to your soundcloud account. I clicked on the first track and I heard electronic music... wtf? not djent or metal? ok... next song... electronic again... ok... Third song: Well, a little better... Fourth song: ""wow, are you serious? sounds like a totally different band..."" Fifth song: ""WTF!?"" These guys are awesome, they sound like an established band!""   See? your music is great but I could have closed the tab much earlier and you would have lost a fan.  That being said, please change the bandcamp layout to the one that lets you play a default song. That way the visitor directly plays the showcased track and bam, it's done, no delays, no additional clicks for the viewer, and higher conversion rate.  Then please spend at least a minute to improve that bio... it really detracts from who you are. Your music sounds orders of magnitude better than what the bio and the overall design are communicating.  If you want to go one step further, and since you're already selling some tracks on bandcamp, I'd say make an EP out of those 3 singles and get a cover design (give people the incentive of picking up the whole EP (3 songs) instead of just 1 or 2 individually. I finished a couple of cd cover designs yesterday, if you are interested you can take a look here (ignore my logo) http://imgur.com/a/9n7fd  Again, to me you sound closer to being signed by a record label than being a ""bedroom composer"" as you literally say in one of your descriptions, so I hope this feedback can help you get on the right track, because sound-wise you're already there."
Djent,2x0at9,KrebiGD,3,Tue Feb 24 23:43:42 2015 UTC,"Cheers dude, I really appreciate the pointers. Already changed. And it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy that you like the songs.  Not trying to come up with an excuse, but I did only set it up in about 25 minutes on a lunch break hahah.  I do only make music as a hobby. I'm not really trying to achieve anything by making music, other than to stop being bored. But having an outsider's opinion on our image is vastly helpful. I'm going to work on making us look professional.   As for the Soundcloud, I use that as a dump for pointless demos and experiments, and to get quick feedback on tests and ideas. I guess I could either spend a while making that look professional too, or dis-associate it with the Bandcamp entirely. I might create a 2nd Soundcloud for finished songs, and link that as the Official Soundcloud.   We are thinking about an EP, but we're probably going to add 1 or 2 more songs first. We do have a few in the works so it shouldn't be too long. Your cover designs are incredible. I'd ask you to do us one, but with both my Drummer and I being arty creative people, we've already decided that we're going to make our own covers. The ones we've got there now are only temporary.  Once again, thanks so much for your support. I really appreciate that you felt kind enough to take the time out of your day to provide all this feeback. When we win the Grammy for Best Metal Band, I'll mention you in my acceptance speech."
Djent,2x0at9,mpskovi,2,Wed Feb 25 00:22:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe I pay too much attention to details, but those minor changes already make me feel better about your page. I personally think it's the details that make a difference, especially when it comes down to purchasing the tracks or not... I mean, I'm not proud of this but I bought more than one cd only because the design looked cool... so even if you do this as a hobby, I think all this stuff ends up becoming relevant at some point.  Anyway I'll wait till the whole EP is out to get it :P  Can't wait to see new tracks! I'm playing the existing ones on repeat xP"

Djent,2wyu9m,ErikMyers5,7,Tue Feb 24 07:17:40 2015 UTC,"I've been listening to Periphery since they put out their first full-length, and in my opinion, the new albums are great. Their sound has definitely changed since 2010, but despite having noticed some backlash I continue to enjoy their new stuff.  Juggernaut is definitely more ""fun"" than their earlier stuff, including more poppy, electronic elements, but they still groove like none other and totally pull it off.  My favorites off of the new releases are probably 22 Faces, The Bad Thing, Hell Below, and Stranger Things, but the whole album is fantastic.  I always have to listen to their albums a few times before they really sink in, but once they get in there they're total earworms, I've been listening to the new stuff nonstop.  My only beef with the new stuff, like many people, are the vocals.  They're not bad by any means, but they're a little more theatrical than on their other material.  Again, this is purely a matter of personal taste, and I understand that it makes sense in the context of an epic concept album like Juggernaut.  It definitely doesn't ruin it for me, I'm just more of a fan of Spencer's work on their earlier material, I feel like he really came into his own on Periphery II."
Djent,2wyu9m,the_drowned_man,1 point,Tue Feb 24 07:32:20 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way with these new albums, I still haven't listened to the older stuff yet. I usually don't prefer bands with a vocalist with such a higher pitch during the cleans, but this singer I do prefer. Thanks for letting me know!"
Djent,2wyu9m,the_drowned_man,2,Tue Feb 24 07:37:04 2015 UTC,"Heck yeah man.  Their other stuff is 100% worth checking out.  My favorites on their S/T are The Walk, Ow My Feelings, and Zyglrox, and anyone will tell you that Jetpacks Was Yes! and Icarus Lives are essential Periphery.  Off of Periphery II, Facepalm Mute, Ji, Make Total Destroy, and Mile Zero are my favorites.  Muramasa, Ragnarok, and Masamune form a sort of ""trilogy"" with similar musical themes that really tie the whole album together, it's pretty cool.  Happy listening, dude!"
Djent,2wyu9m,Stangstag,2,Tue Feb 24 07:42:24 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I've listened to Zyglrox, Facepalm Mute, and Ragnarok since I've posted this thread and I must say I like them all a good amount. Really glad I stumbled upon this band. I can't wait to listen them all."
Djent,2wyu9m,GrowlingSpoon,5,Tue Feb 24 08:00:39 2015 UTC,"Juggernaut is epic. Best songs are the last 2 on the Omega album (Omega, Stranger Things), and most of the singles they released (The Bad Thing, 22 Faces, Graveless, Alpha).  Periphery is definitely the best band in the ""djent"" or ""progressive"" scene in my opinion. They consistently put out excellent material, and they can do heavy, jazzy, pop, light rock, pretty much anything. Spencer (the vocalist) really puts Periphery over the top and really makes the band unique to others in the genre.  Its also important to note that Periphery's 1st album was almost entirely written by Misha Mansoor (main guitarist), so it sounds alot different than their newer stuff which has been written in conjunction with the other band members"
Djent,2wyu9m,bigstupidjellyfish,3,Tue Feb 24 08:54:04 2015 UTC,"Idk about periphery being the best in the scene. Id say Animals as Leaders would give them a run for their money. Just my two sense though, both are fantastic."
Djent,2wyu9m,zyglrox35,5,Tue Feb 24 09:31:28 2015 UTC,AAL is best instrumental band. Periphery is best band with vocals.
Djent,2wyu9m,cornbreadz,8,Wed Feb 25 00:26:04 2015 UTC,"Juggernaut>P1>P2.    I believe that the new albums are their best work to date.  I'm a later Periphery fan, discovered them during the tour cycle for P2.  So, I was exposed to P2 mostly before I got to listen to their self titled.  This Time It's Personal got my attention, for sure, but when I heard Icarus Lives! and Zyglrox for the first time, I became a fan (at least enough of a fan to make it my username).    Clear was good, but it only left me hungry for more.  Juggernaut definitely satisfied the craving... after it grew on me.  Which is something I discovered about Periphery; each album needs time to grow on you.    Now, the vocals on this album are incredibly theatrical, but it is a concept album; it's all supposed to be theatrical. Just my $0.02."
Djent,2wyu9m,TranscendTheIllusion,1 point,Tue Feb 24 07:53:08 2015 UTC,"I just listened to Zyglrox and that song is awesome. When the DJ announced that the song was Periphery, she said that she recently went to a show and it's one of her favorite bands to see. I believe I got my friend hooked on them too, hopefully they come near NJ soon because I really want to see them now"
Djent,2wyu9m,moikey,3,Tue Feb 24 07:57:40 2015 UTC,"Been listening to Periphery since the first album and I really like the newer stuff.  I think they had real success trying out different styles and whatnot.  That being said, I definitely prefer the older stuff and in my opinion they'll never release anything as raw as P1.    Also, this might not be a popular opinion, but I'm not a huge fan of the vocal work in the newer stuff.  It's just too poppy sounding for me alot of the time.  Again, I'm biased towards their older tunes.  Either way you see it I think they make great music!"
Djent,2wyu9m,MalluRed,1 point,Tue Feb 24 13:41:38 2015 UTC,"I am right there with you. P1 is and looks like will always be my preference. The word ""raw"" is a great way to describe it. I hope I can come around and get into Juggernaut because Periphery has incredible potential."
Djent,2wyu9m,LogicalThought,3,Wed Feb 25 19:15:27 2015 UTC,"I like them, I'm a pretty new fan, but they have pretty much a 50/50 blend of hits and misses for me. This is common though. I probably couldn't name you an album in which I liked every single song. I reckon that I would enjoy a Misha solo record more than Periphery, but they are a great band, and all of them are very talented guys."
Djent,2wyu9m,degucom17,1 point,Wed Feb 25 10:36:35 2015 UTC,"I'd echo this thought as well. I'm not a fan of songs like MK Ultra (and the screaming vocals), I really like the song that came after that 'Heavy Heart'. It's just my taste that's different, I reckon.Either way, 'Stranger Things' is ' epic! I find myself imagining about being on a stage and singing, everytime I listen to it."
Djent,2wyu9m,Ruchie74,2,Thu Feb 26 06:52:05 2015 UTC,"I started listening to periphery around when their second album came out but I actually listened to PI first. I like all of their albums pretty equally but juggernaut perhaps a little less than the others. Some of the songs just don't sit well with my tastes, specifically alpha.  I literally thought I was listening to fall out boy when I first heard that song. It's definitely grown on me now but still not one of my favorites. I really like rainbow gravity, 22 faces, the bad thing, graveless, four lights, omega, and the scourge (except for the first 1:30, it sounds like it was a lazily written riff), same thing with the beginning of hell below. Overall I really like juggernaut, but it isn't quite what I expected. Not sure whether that's good or bad. Probably a bit of both."
Djent,2wyu9m,Gypsy456,2,Tue Feb 24 19:34:50 2015 UTC,"I like periphery 2 the best, but probably just because I'm a huge protest the hero fan and the rody walker influence on the vocals there is out of control. Plus the drumming on that album is the tits and it's really well paced to boot. Periphery 1 is good but not all the songs catch me. Juggernaut is better than P1, but it's just not as much fun to listen to as P2 for me. Clear never happened."
Djent,2wyu9m,LeWee,2,Tue Feb 24 19:42:40 2015 UTC,Periphery I > Icarus > Juggernaut: Omega > Periphery II: This Time it's Personal > Juggernaut: Alpha > Clear  These new albums are a step forward to their old feel. They were never be old Periphery but I found these albums to be a higher quality than their last bit of work. A step in a better direction that I like.

Definitely give all of their stuff a listen, but I would highly recommend listening from start to finish of Juggernaut in order and pay attention to the lyrics. It adds SO much to the experience."
Djent,2wyu9m,LogicalThought,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"I had known of them for a while but never got into them, until I heard The Bad Thing, from there I started listening to all the older stuff. They are simply just amazing. Misha is ridiculous at writing great riffs. Juggernaut is such an awesome album, and having it as a concept album is awesome. 22 Faces and Stranger Things are my favorites off the album for sure."
Djent,2wyu9m,Titanik14,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:43:02 2015 UTC,"Juggernaut is in my opinion Periphery's magnum opus. I love concept albums, and when I heard that Periphery was writing one, I got really pumped. The album completely blew away my expectations."
Djent,2wyu9m,grimandnordic1,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:57:23 2015 UTC,"Juggernaut>P2>P1>Icarus>Clear, imo.  I literally listened to Juggernaut nonstop for at least 3 and a half weeks when it released. Now I'll listen to the rest of my ipod, but at least once or twice a week I go back to Juggernaut. It's just so god damn good, I can't get enough of it.  Personally, I find their pre-P2 stuff almost boring in comparison. I still enjoy it a lot, but everything else they've come out with just gets exponentially better with every release. They're a group of incredible musicians; both individually and especially as a whole. They're all so astoundingly talented in every respect and when they come together they literally make magic happen.  Though, I will say one criticism I have with Juggernaut is that Matt Halpern's drumming almost pales in comparison to his work on P2. That said, it's still a solid effort. But, it's obvious that overall theme and story for the album took precedence over being as progressive as humanly possible, so I can't fault them there.   Bottom line, I fucking love Periphery and it's rad that you do too."
Djent,2wyu9m,Siendorf,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:52:39 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you on Matt's drumming, but in this case I don't think that it is a result of his own doing.  Matt was sort of limited on the style he could write the drums parts around without making them sound out of place.  A lot of this album is rather poppy and if you put a really techy drum part over a really poppy guitar, it's going to sound weird.  I do wish they were more progressive on this album though."

Djent,2wvuyn,TrainOfThought6,5,Tue Feb 24 00:40:03 2015 UTC,Hotttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt  Gave up on the band after they added a vocalist (didn't like his voice or the focus of the music at all) but this is great news :D
Djent,2wvuyn,prodiG,4,Mon Feb 23 20:33:16 2015 UTC,I guess aaron got tired of all the hate with the vocalist.
Djent,2wvuyn,Stangstag,6,Mon Feb 23 20:51:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I asked him what he thought of all the backlash and he seemed to be very upset that fans were trashing the vocals. Poor guy.
Djent,2wvuyn,OHkindgoon,14,Mon Feb 23 21:31:51 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved the vocals. Very fresh compared to all the other bands that rely solely on screaming and high pitched singing. But ig, even in a world of music such as this that prides itself on diversity of sound, people still just want to hear the same shit over and over. Sometimes fans of this genre seem like serious xenophobes."
Djent,2wvuyn,Stangstag,8,Mon Feb 23 22:06:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't understand all the hate towards GOOD clean vocals. I guess people associate GOOD vocals with radio/pop music? Who knows.   Dan Thompkins and Spencer Sotelo are amazing vocalists.
Djent,2wvuyn,LogicalThought,3,Mon Feb 23 22:36:11 2015 UTC,Good is completely subjective.

Djent,2wvuyn,LogicalThought,1 point,Tue Feb 24 05:21:28 2015 UTC,"Yup.  I have no problem with clean vocals, particularly when they aren't girly sounding.  He had that going for him, but he was flat as all fuck.  Just pure boredom throughout 90% of the album.  No range, no push, no nothing."

Djent,2wvuyn,goodbye9hello10,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:34:19 2015 UTC,"It'd suck if they gave in, mostly because I've been through this with lots of bands and I dug vocals. As comparison, it's like Van Hagar vs. Van Halen, modern Rush vs. Hemispheres. Guess they just prefer one sound to another"

Djent,2wvuyn,bbristowe,3,Tue Feb 24 05:42:22 2015 UTC,The vocalist is alright or whatever... but I loved intervals as an instrumental band. Pretty neat to see this.
Djent,2wvuyn,bbristowe,1 point,Mon Feb 23 19:11:12 2015 UTC,This also means we can get the vocal tracks isolated :) cool for remixes and stuff!

Djent,2wxic2,djent_illini,1 point,Tue Feb 24 09:08:30 2015 UTC,I saw them 3 times in Illinois. The show with Scale The Summit was awesome when they got everyone to get on their knees and just up when the djent started. They played at a tiny venue and Olly's guitar strings broke so it was just Browne playing. They were great with Devy and AAL.
Djent,2wxic2,IIIPatrickStevensIII,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:51:43 2015 UTC,"I was at the last metro show as well, best show I saw all year! I was also pleasantly surprised to see Alex Rudinger playing drums that night"
Djent,2wxic2,djent_illini,2,Thu Feb 26 21:33:27 2015 UTC,"I was also surprised to see him again with Revocation at The Contortionist tour. From what I learned from talking to him, he does not want to make a new band anymore but wants to be playing drums for other bands that are stable. Sounds like The Faceless took a negative toll on him...."
Djent,2wxic2,IIIPatrickStevensIII,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:55:55 2015 UTC,"For real, I cannot blame him for feeling that way at all. The Faceless have been one of my favorite bands for a long time, but I have completely lost track of how many lineup changes there have been at this point. Alex is one of the most talented drummers out there, so I'm sure he will have no trouble finding other groups with a much better vibe than The Faceless/Michael Keene."

Djent,2wtjtj,BreeTea,5,Mon Feb 23 04:17:16 2015 UTC,Its a great mix! i boosted a bit of the lows and highs but overall it fit so well! too much fun!
Djent,2wtjtj,BreeTea,7,Mon Feb 23 04:22:41 2015 UTC,"Well that was awesome, man! If I make anything else that could use some vocals, would you mind me sending you the track and, if you're into, maybe you could throw some vocals on it? As a side note to this, I rarely have the chance to finish projects in any sort of timely fashion, so don't worry about getting swamped with requests from me or anything like that. Haha, but I'd definitely be down for a collab of some sort in the future if you were as well."

Djent,2wsnlw,WUSSUPMONKEY,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:13:42 2015 UTC,I think they switch between drop f and g standard
Djent,2wsnlw,Jessebgrind,1 point,Mon Feb 23 01:45:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah what /u/WUSSUPMONKEY said is right, they use 7 strings tuned to either G standard or drop F (except for ""Shiver"" which is in Dropped A). But since I'm using an 8 string I dropped the whole song half a tone to play in F# standard."
