I keep thinking how the ultimate problem is the demand for the drugs; the cartels just supply them.  Maybe if all drugs were legalized like alcohol is?  But to propose legalizing cocaine, heroin, and meth would be political suicide on either the left or right.

I didn't find numbers for meth, but if it was as bad as cocaine and heroine combined, alcohol would still be in the lead by ~200%.  Of course you could argue that if the illegal drugs were legalized then more people would use them. I'm sure that's true to some extent, but I doubt it would be enough to cause 3x more deaths.

I wonder how much Mexicans really identify nationalistically as Mexican moreso than they would identify as belonging first and foremost to their region? I'm sure in relation to the US and the gringos, Mexicans identify much more as Mexican, but how much does a feeling of being Mexican override a more local/region sense of identity? Because honestly, if El Chapo can do what the Federalis cannot...I can think of no explanation for why that would be that didn't include a stronger sense of localism/regionalism than nationalism.

My experience has been that while obviously people have close ties to the different areas they come from there's a strong sense of national identity. It's not like Spain or Italy with their different regional differences.  The problem is that the local government is either too corrupt or incompetent to effectively protect property rights, enforce laws, help the poor, provide good education and other things that governments are supposed to do. This is where the cartels come in. For example, where I'm from small business owners have had Zetas roll up and demand a percentage of their income in exchange for their ""protection."" They can't go to the police because the run the risk of the police being corrupt and either not doing anything or reporting back to the Zetas. So the only choice they have is either to pay, close down, or refuse to pay and get killed.  El Chapo and the Sinaloa cartel are popular because they are the enemies of the Zetas and the new generation of cartels-which are seen as being ruthless and blood thirsty. In comparison El Chapo is seen as representing the old school cartels that had a sense of honor and would only mess with people that were involved in the game and not involve civilians. I can't speak as to how accurate that is but that's how I hear people talk about it.  There is a deep distrust and lack of faith in the government that has more to do with it than regionalism."

El Chapo's cartel is not nearly as violent and ruthless as the Zetas cartel, for example. And they have a history of ""sticking to business"" and leaving the people alone. If there's such a thing, they are the ""best of the worst"" in terms of Mexico's drug gangs.   They're still criminals though, and Mexico would be much better of without them, that's for sure. And for the record, I'm saying this as a mexican, and I would still call ignorant and dumb my fellow mexicans who make heroes of the narcos. But I also don't blame them. Mexico is a deeply unequal country that allows some people to have access to the best education while others don't get to finish primary school, if they even go to school at all.

Obviously, this doesn't hold true for substances which can be grown or manufactured nearly everywhere.   Legalizing marijuana, alcohol, or amphetamines would mean that new firms can legally compete with previously criminal ones in a place where better products and better prices drive unworthy firms into extinction.

They ARE the three most heavily-regulated legal industries in America. They're also cartelized or monopolized to a degree that means John Q Consumer gets the shaft.   I don't think legalization is the solution to ALL of the drug problems. Don't get me wrong, I think there are some specific substances where legalization is the best approach possible (alcohol, marijuana) - I just don't think that it's necessarily the best solution in practice for other markets.  There's more to a market than just consumers, distributors, and producers. Some substances are truly ripe for explosion into a massive legal market (alcohol and marijuana) which can benefit from consumer choice, public safety campaigns, and distributed manufacturing which keeps competition tight. Other industries are so concentrated that they are nearly monopolized or cartelized - those controlling these monopolies will wield exorbitant political control.   I live in San Diego. I can buy pot and weed from a corner store, a dispensary, a cartel, or I can find a friend that makes them in his backyard. Cartels have competition when selling pot, even if dispensaries get outlawed, because home growers can steal their market share. But if I wanted cocaine, I would be hard-pressed to find anyone growing coca leaves here, so any cocaine I buy will come from a cartel deal, distributor, and eventually from a plot that a cartel runs. Even if we legalize cocaine, their entire infrastructure stays intact. Even if it cuts down on violence in the U.S., it won't cut down on the violence in Mexico and South America that the cartels cause  I'm looking at this from a purely economic standpoint.

What you just said means it'll be harder, and take longer. But if you start providing the cartels with options better than having to deal with the hassles of the black market -- all of the costs associated with smuggling, arrests, seizures, war -- then slowly but surely they're going to start finding ways to utilize those legitimate avenues to cut costs and increase profits, and the more you (i.e. the government) are responsible for their profits the more influence you have over them. Like any business. With time, lots of time, the cartels can be molded into something stomachable.  It'll no doubt take many decades, and the industry will probably remain pretty slimy forever, like many legal industries we have today, but slowly you can at least nudge the cartels in the direction of legitimization and away from the endemic violence we have today. And of course it won't happen JUST due to decriminalization, I just don't think any of what else that needs to be done will be effective without it -- it's the key piece of the puzzle that makes everything else we need to do possible.

However, I was expecting a different tone from the article based off the title and the part at the beginning that says    Like the cathedrals of bygone eras, galleries are now the ultimate buildings of our times – and the way we use them mimics religious rituals...   I guess I was expecting more expansion on this idea rather than using the idea of churches as places of art and great architecture and then comparing that idea to modern museums. The only thing the writer even says about the ""ecclesiastical"" behavior of museum-goers is that they tend to go to museums on Sundays, and they use religious language in the description of art. Both of which can be explained as religious language and images have been used in art, music, architecture, and literature outside of the church for decades if not longer. As well as Sunday becoming less a day of worship and religion and more just another day off for many people in Western societies.   I'm more interested in expanding upon that idea that the decline of religious spirituality in Western societies has led to the spiritualization of other things such as art."

Foodforthought,3dyhu7,iambingalls,4,Mon Jul 20 21:08:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about Nietsche(having taken 0 philosophy classes), but it is an interesting idea the way he describes culture as fulfilling the gap left by a lack of religious belief. If you really break it down, religion and culture(philosophy, art, music, literature, etc.) are very similar in that they stimulate ideas. Some people may disagree, but reading through a lot of religious texts, they bring up interesting concepts, such as the Beatitudes and Nirvana/Enlightenment. If you think of religion in this more intellectual manner, culture could very well replace it.   Even treating religion in a less intellectual manner and thinking about the community it creates, we can even look to music fans/genres as creating a similar community. The punk and hip hop cultures specifically have created communities where little matters besides a mutual love for the music and the ideas espoused through the music(anti-consumerism, anti-government, etc.) and people become part of a family that goes beyond race and gender. This same idea is found in many religions as Christianity specifically espouses, ""There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.""(Gal. 3:28)  The only thing I see that culture could not replace is the idea of a afterlife and that our actions have eternal consequences. Although some aspects of culture deny the idea of an afterlife which is an indirect way of fulfilling that desire/need.  That said, I do think religion will always have a place in society, but I doubt it will be as large as it was in the feudal era ever again. I actually like religion a lot better when it isn't explicitly tied to a government as I think many governments just use religions to their advantage which distorts the religion's true identity(as we can see with the rise of the religious right in the U.S.) but that's a discussion for another time and one that I don't have all the answers for."

Despite the South's growing economy, in general Southern states are more dependent on Federal funding and therefore tend to receive more funding than they pay in taxes (sources: 1 2 ). Of course, if you look at the sources, it's not just the South that receives greater funding. However, the sad irony that I see is that the places where one is most like to find people screaming ""small government"" and wanting to end federal welfare programs are exactly the places that benefit the most from these welfare programs! People, don't bite the hand that feeds you! My tax federal dollars, in general, are going more the benefit your state, which is fine, like I said, we're in this together.

It's one of a long line of thinkers and books extolling the ideology of technology and networks.

So people are hanging on to the old ways, living in the present and waiting, cautiously. Another stock market crash, global warming, wars in Europe and Asia, pandemic, terrorism - none of these surprise us indeed we almost expect them to crash together in some almighty global conflagration.

In Canada you would do the currency change then reduce the amount by 15% to account for that. A rough calculation puts the resulting amount a few percentage points under your minimum wage (full time). So if you really want it then one first step would be to get a job illegally paying you less than minimum wage. I do not recommend this.  One note, the numbers start to include many unknowns when you go across country lines. Exchange rates and cost of living are slippery. That is also the high estimate of average as census in poor countries have bad data. What is certain is that you would work full time or more and pay would increase very slowly if at all. We have also ignored the cost of burning everything down and building it back up which would have to be paid out of that number. We have ignored the benefit of equality of pay regardless of performance which could have nearly any effect or none.

Foodforthought,3dw3co,Vilantius,15,Tue Jul 21 03:44:37 2015 UTC,At least the author of the article explained his case. You simply made fun of what he said with a handful of words and no explanation at all. That doesn't exactly have any substance.
Foodforthought,3dw3co,Nathan173AB,8,Mon Jul 20 05:51:21 2015 UTC,"At least the author of the article explained his case.   That doesn't mean his case is valid. He's talking about the sharing economy as if sharing is somehow post-capitalism. Capitalism is the private ownership of the means of production. In other words, private individuals and groups of individuals own factories, banks, distribution centres, etc. The 'sharing economy' implies goods owned by individuals leased out to other individuals as a service, such as sharing your car (Uber), house (AirBNB), etc. These are two completely different ideas that encompass two completely different sectors of the broader economy. Capitalism isn't ending and it isn't going into some post-phase, it's basically the same as it was 50 years ago, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's the same 50 years from now.  Secondly, this idea of a ""project"" of his is essentially economics. Economics studies both the interactions between individuals in marketplaces (macroeconomics) and the behaviour of individuals and businesses interacting with the marketplace (microeconomics). The first of these is this ""project based on reason, evidence, and testable designs that cuts with the grain of history and is sustainable to the planet"". Mainstream macroeconomic theory does exactly this: models of the economy which are founded on reason are tested alongside real economic happenings to test their validity. These models improve over time as historic events (such as stagflation) change the way we think about the relationship between variables.  In regards to the ""sustainable to the planet"" part, environmental economics has known for a long time that pollution is unsustainable and bad for both the environment and the economy. The reason nothing is done about it is because political lobbying twists the story the other way in a non-economic fashion. This happens because businesses who pollute lose out when they have to pay the costs of their pollution, even if the damage they do to the economy is vast. This is the classic problem of private incentives causing behaviour that is in the private good, but is a public loss.  Finally, the article is hopefully optimistic. Talking about utopias just comes off as so pretentious and fallacious to me. You can dream as much as you want, the world is never going to be a utopia. There will always be problems, and the best approach is to not ignore those problems to go live in la-la land where everyone shares stuff and the capitalist economy is 'a thing of the past', but to meet those challenges head on in the public interest. Articles like this prevent realistic, researched, and well-reasoned approaches be drowned out by populist nonsense that has no basis in fact or understanding."

Believing the world is moving in a particular direction based on anecdotal evidence, then claiming that this move is good for humanity supposes that we are moving in the right direction, and that this direction implies the death of modern capitalism. Capitalism is imperfect in how it's being applied, but it can be improved. Economists study market interactions and the behaviour of individuals, and have made many recommendations as to how to improve the world we live in. However, there's more to be had than just debate, and ultimately, policy decisions come down to who can shout the loudest. I don't think rejecting capitalism is the solution, we merely need people to better understand its fundamentals, and to push for the change that is in the social good.  As for information sharing, it's changed a lot in our modern world. But, keep in mind that we are only 20 years out with the internet, and only in the last decade or so has it really played a major role in our day to day lives. The full impact of the information era has yet to be realized, and it's naive to call the game before it's even half way done. We have global communications, yes, but they can be shut off by the flip of a switch (think Egypt during the Arab Spring). We have emails and digital communiqués, but they can often be monitored and controlled by the powers that be. We have big data and information sharing, but we haven't figured out how to use it yet."

Capitalism will always be around in some form or another because there is always scarcity in some form or another, but scarcities are often eliminated and capitalist behavior becomes irrelevant as a result.

People who have a bed will want an apartment, people who have an apartment will want a house, and people who have a house will want a second home or a mansion.

That's not what I said. People are going to want more than basic necessities, of course. What I'm saying is that at some point most are going to draw the line and say enough is enough. That line isn't usually at basic necessities.   People derive their happiness not based on absolutely met needs, but based on how they perceive their status relative to their peers. That's why people who don't have a car will want to buy one, and people who have a car will want a Tesla. People who have a bed will want an apartment, people who have an apartment will want a house, and people who have a house will want a second home or a mansion.   No, I don't agree because I don't see it. Obviously some people are like this, but I don't see this type of behavior most of the time. I don't see most people who own cars endeavoring to buy a Tesla and I don't see most people who own a house endeavoring to move into a mansion. When it comes to myself, once self-driving cars become a practical thing, I'm selling mine. Owning a car is just one extra burden to tend to. I already have an apartment, and I don't want a house because I find it would be a waste without currently having a family, let alone a mansion.

Basic income won't change that.

And for some of them it might be in pursuit of fuller wealth because they think that in order to be happy they need to have more money than their peers. And maybe for some that does lead to true happiness.   You said ""People derive their happiness not based on absolutely met needs, but based on how they perceive their status relative to their peers."" That's a pretty unambiguous statement, and I'd argue that while some people might function that way, there's plenty that don't. And for many that do, much of that thinking is likely driven by a capitalist culture constantly telling them that they should think that way. But to suggest that that is the only way that humans can approach life is silly.   As for sexual competition, the same thing applies. Maybe that is a big motivator for some. I'm 35, happily married with a kid, and fortunate enough to be financially secure. Sexual competition is nowhere on my radar when I pull myself out of bed and go to work in the morning.

If you are indeed fortunate enough to be financially secure, then why don't you reduce the amount you work to the minimum necessary to put food on your table and maybe feed and put a roof over your wife and child?  Are you saving money for your child's college? That isn't a basic necessity, lots of people don't do that. Are you living in the smallest place you and your family can survive in? If you're working extra hard so that you can live in a bigger place, that's certainly more work than you need to do. Do you take your family on vacations? Do you ever have to fly to get there? You definitely don't need to do that. Those thousands of dollars could mean an early retirement or negotiating a lower salary with your firm so you can be home with your family more.  If your answer is that you just love your job - do you ever ask for raises? Do you ever seek promotion? Those are self serving, if you only worked because you loved your job, you wouldn't ever need a raise, as long as your minimum needs were being met."

If our civilization is indeed on the path to a post-scarcity world, where technology provides can provide all of the essentials as well as a reasonable amount of ""spending money"" for everyone, then I think there are plenty of people who would happily jump off of the 40+/hr per week treadmill, even if it meant an overall pay cut.

Instead, I get:   Has the constant appeal to fairness worked to benefit the disadvantaged? For the first time in the postwar years, we have young working-age people leaving the labor force to live on the benefits they receive from the welfare system supplemented by occasional earnings in the underground economy. The unfortunate long-term consequence is that these workers never develop job skills and never receive the on-the-job training that increases their productivity and wages. They will remain unskilled and the rest of us will not benefit from their increased productivity.   That seems to put all the blame on benefits (which to my knowledge have not increased significantly recently) instead of the weak job market, especially for young works (job markets, especially for young workers, have weakened and in places all but collapsed in the wake of the economic crisis). The piece is full of such fuzzy, half-thought out claims.    Americans did not become wealthy by redistributing income. They became wealthy by innovating, learning, and working hard. Most of the immigrants that came were unskilled. So, too, were the workers who came from the farms to industry. They began at the bottom, learned by doing on-the-job training, and earned higher wages. This model seems to be breaking down in our current economic climate.

A very good example is Google; that is starting to become obsessed with the pop stars. This search engine company has made a change in its marketing strategy. Last month, he joined Lady Gaga in an ad to show all the opportunities offered by the Chrome browser. Now he has done the same with Justin Bieber.   The announcement is similar to Gaga, but also shares some similarities with the recent announcement Dear Sophie, which shows a father using Chrome and other Google products to remember her daughter's childhood.   It makes sense that Google has thought Bieber for their promotion. The young celebrity was discovered thanks to his performances uploaded to Youtube. And with it, Google manages to reach an important demographic: teenage girls.   One of his secrets: Its well-defined market.   Justin Bieber is not intended that all are his fans; he knows it would be almost impossible, yet the market for young girls have it well controlled. So it adds the elements of marketing, good use of digital tools and a well-defined market and the rest is history."

For example, I'd hedge my bets that the average maths or Classics or economics graduate (from a reputable university) has a higher IQ than the average media studies, writing or liberal arts graduate.   At least in my day we were steered into ""traditional"" degree because they had more kudos and weight."
Foodforthought,3dtxqe,istara,5,Sun Jul 19 16:57:20 2015 UTC,"In my experience, having experience in the field counts more than the degree. I've made good money doing tech writing and marketing writing, and my BA is in English (to give you and my father a heart attack, I actually had a triple concentration in the humanities.)  I don't have an MA, because I don't need one and I don't like debt. I won't go back for a business or tech degree, because I don't need them and I don't like debt.   I hustled early on in my career (and before I graduated college) to dip my toes into marketing and tech writing, and it's turned out pretty well for me. I always joke that I should just go into IT, since I've been writing about it for years.  Here's the thing: there are a lot of English majors who can't write. That's the difference. I've seen mathematics majors get lucrative writing positions, because they could a) write about something they had to research and b) write well. That's really what sets you apart in this industry. Having seen some of the people who apply for writing positions at my company, I can tell you that a lot of aspiring writers have serious cases of Dunning-Kruger.  If I had any advice to give to an aspiring writer, it would be this:   Write well. Just because you graduated with honors doesn't mean you write well. Find out if you suck at writing, and if you do, find another career. Your degree matters less than your experience. Build a portfolio as soon as you can. Start before you graduate college (or change careers), if possible. Corollary to the previous: invest as little in your degree as possible. If you get a scholarship, take it. If you can do two years in community college for free before transferring, do that. Stay in state, if possible. Debt sucks, and the fact that I was debt-free right out of the gate gave me a ton of financial freedom. The best money is in tech writing and business proposals. If that doesn't suit your fancy, marketing and PR writing are good bets, too. Commit to journalism if you're really willing to hustle, uber talented, and sure that that's what you want to do. Just know you'll be putting up with a ton of bullshit if you go the journalism route."
Foodforthought,3dtxqe,40000headmen,4,Sun Jul 19 19:36:04 2015 UTC,"100% agree with all of this.  My BA was also in English, but Literature and some Linguistics, zero creative writing or anything related. It wasn't on the face of it a ""useful"" degree - though actually it has been, in terms of literary background for writing - but it was a traditional, rigorous degree and respected as such. Obviously going to a well-regarded university also helps, and at least back in my day, none of the traditional/Ivy League equivalents (in the UK) offered ""soft"" (perceived) subjects like creative writing or media studies.  That said, I am still conscious that it would have been more helpful to have done economics, history, PPE or similar in terms of background. At least in the early stages of a writing-related career (obviously you can and do pick up stuff on the job).   I see people planning to spend tens (hundreds?) of thousands of bucks to major in ""creative writing"" and it disgusts me that anyone would take their money. Particularly when they have no discernible ability. It would be like me doing a degree in opera/voice when I can barely bloody sing. Way, way, way too much risk."

I think it's unfashionable for teachers and (especially) professors to talk to students about the ROI of their education, but here in the U.S., kids are taking out the equivalent of a mortgage on a condo to get their degrees. Shouldn't they expect to make that back?   And what's the point, if you can't? I'm a big fan of learning, but there are plenty of opportunities to learn nearly anything you want outside of a college campus, for free. In many cases, you'd be better off paying a tutor.   So what's the value added of a university education? Besides the wealth of resources and the experienced professors (who may or may not actually be good educators), it's the credentials you receive at the end. You need to map the credentials to a career path to get a return on your investment. No, it's not a romantic way to look at education, but lofty notions about enriching the mind and soul won't buy your way out of hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt.

By 2000, everyone got locked up and we've been seeing record crime lows.  Cities like New York City went from dumps infested with crime to hipster wonderland.  Many people were touched by crime, and people -want- harsh sentencing.  The biggest - and supposedly progressive - state in the country voted to put a very draconian 3 strikes law into action.    USA has a huge prison population because USA has a ton of criminals.  A much better question to ask is why does USA produce so many criminals?  Why do we compare ourselves to fuckin' dumps like Honduras and Guatemala when we talk about homicide/etc rates, instead of comparing ourselves to Japan and Germany?  It's a very embarrassing comparison to make.    IMO, it comes down to the drug business and giant social inequality.  USA ghettos/trailer parks look and feel worse than many Third World areas.  (And yes, I've been to many developing countries.)  During this century, we've seen the establishment of giant poverty encampments - both rural and urban - and in the end, poverty breeds poverty, crime breeds crime.  In the USA, we focus on the punishment and barely look at prevention.    I grew up in Europe and live in the USA.  It doesn't matter what prison and sentencing reforms are put in place.  You don't lower crime rates by magically locking up fewer people.  Nothing is going to change unless high crime areas are somehow busted up into little pieces and there is some bigger effort to turn ghettos into normal neighborhoods."

The various law enforcement agencies ""solve"" roughly 2/3rds of murder cases, sure some of those may be innocent but that's worlds better than many countries ahead of us on these incarceration rate lists.

In the US, one's work is expected to be very important to their sense of identity and place in the world.  If you have what is perceived as a bad job or you see yourself as defined by things outside of work, you become a social deviant.  Teaching children that they can be whatever they want is part of the culture that puts work above everything else, and teaches people that if you aren't working a fulfilling and lucrative job you are not a good person.  Without such messages US workers might expect things like paid time off and fair labor practices.  *Side note: One of the funniest moments of my life was in Human Growth and Development.  The professor was explaining that IQ is a good broad indicator of ability, and said, ""For example, most people with an IQ of 100 (average) will not be able to become doctors.""

But before I could find a job I loved, I had to spend a long time working jobs that I didn't like.  I had to study things I didn't like.  I had to spend a few years doing stuff I actually hated.  Never once did I feel like a failure because I wasn't experiencing all that ""love"" people were telling me I was supposed to be feeling.  Nor did I get ""burnt out"" or suffer from a mid-quarter crisis.  I just kept my nose to the grind and hoped eventually things worked out.  Because I had the weekends and the evenings to do what I wanted to do.  As long as you have some time set aside for yourself, then you should be able to endure all kinds of sucky jobs.    My ancestors were sharecroppers, coal miners, and maids.  If someone had told them that they wouldn't be happy in life unless they had a job they loved, they would have laughed in that fool's face.   If it hadn't been for them willing to work whatever job they could without flinging themselves off a damn bridge or holding themselves up in their parents' basement like a depressed blob, I wouldn't be here...doing what I love.

I'm currently ducking out of a grad program with a master's and abandoning my pursuit of a PhD. Idk what I'm going to do, I don't have a job lined up, and while I'm in a STEM field, I really worry about how marketable I am right now. Still, I could not be happier. I'm happy because for a very long time I've felt this unreasonable responsibility to not ever quit, never change paths, never accept that I'm in over my head - and it's such a relief to finally just pack up and leave.   Granted, I have accomplished a lot and I'm sure this will all buff out in the long run, but I'm absolutely a little bitter that I've battled and fought for so long for something I just don't want any part of. It of course starts will well meaning family and friends giving you the ""you can be anything"", but what's worse is that these ideas are perpetuated by schools and especially by college PR/outreach campaigns looking to squeeze a few more bucks out of students who shouldn't be paying this much for college. In the end we have millions of young adults who feel like worthless failures because they didn't live up to these vague standards put forth, or because they 'just didn't try hard enough.' And it's such needless bullshit.  What's worse is the standards we have in place now - standards put in place by the same older generations who scoff when a young adult can't find a job right out of college. Want to get a good entry level job? Well that requires 5 years experience in your field. Maybe the older generations running the show need to review a dictionary to see what 'entry level' means. Want to buy a house? Well thanks to mismanagement of our housing systems, there's no certainty your hard earned money won't just end up in some sleezy bankers pocket while the country bails out his company. Want to go out and live your life? Too bad, we expect you to work 50 hour weeks and respond to emails on all of your 'off time'.   It's just insane. Yes, I can't lie - I want nice things. I'd love the 6 figure salary, a big ass house, a model wife with an IQ of 150, a dream job, and for everyone to be envious of how awesome I am. But it isn't going to happen. And it's so much nicer accepting that. I absolutely could get a PhD in my field, and all I'd have to do is give up my happiness, security, and youth. That's it!   Forget that. My new goal is to do whatever I can to become marketable, make a respectable income (but not shoot for the stars), and just enjoy life. My dream job would be 3 days a week, 10-12 hours a day, and them a 4 day weekend. I like the sprints, but I also like time off so that I crave going back to it. I think 40 hours is overkill and ineffective. I want to still be able to sleep in, get drunk or smoke a bit, have fun, but still have a career. I don't think it's asking much. Fuck doing anything I want, I'll be happy living day to day.   Sorry for the rant, this is a weird stage of my life."

But I think the problem is mostly the money/prestige dimension.  Look at the list of things kids want to do.  All of them are things that people admire that pay well.    Asking what job you want is the wrong question.  So much of whether you like the job comes down to the company.  Being an accountant in a nonprofit organization is different than being one in a bank.  And even then, the people can make the difference in any job.  So planning on a job based on some trumped up picture of what it's like doesn't help.  But the best method I found for figuring out what I want is figuring out what I DO.  I'm a numbers person, I like looking at data and taking it apart to see behind the data.  I want to know how much and why.  Any job where I get to do that would be a decent fit.  But to take that to mean that I belong in just anything, nope, not true.  I need time to think about my answers.  Don't put me on the spot, I need to think.  I'm not original, so cross off some things that require me to invent completely new things.  That's not a writer (what I said I wanted as a teen girl), nor a game designer, probably not an app designer either.  I'm not going to create the next Facebook or reddit.

Foodforthought,3dm3m6,maiqthetrue,2,Fri Jul 17 20:30:45 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on this topic: I have personally achieved every single dream I've had in life, and exceeded many - some beyond my wildest dreams. And I'm well on the way to achieving more and more fantastical dreams, out of the realms of most people's imagination. So I fully believe that people CAN achieve almost any dream they may have, with the caveat that those dreams fall within the realm of possibility:  . Can you be the next Rhianna? Sure, if you're average looking, and average-sounding. Can you be the next POtUS if you're born in Iran? Most probably not...  That sort of thing.   . That said, what I don't think people really realize is how mind-numbingly hard you have to work for some dreams to happen. And the shit you have to put up with along the way, and still stick with it.   . My current dream that I'm chasing started almost 2 years ago. Back then, I thought I needed to invest a few hours here and there, and I'd ""get there"" in a few months. Then I realized I need to be working on it a little every day. Now it's most of the day, every day, sacrificing time with many friends, girlfriends, family, etc. I think about it at work and even dream about it. I've had many days/ weeks where I hated myself, or even came home crying (grown man in his late 20s). But always went at it again the next day. And that's okay because it means the world to me - and has given me more happiness than I ever thought I'd have access to.  . And I'm getting closer and closer to achieving it every day, and there is zero doubt in my mind that I'll get there - working at my current rate, over the next 2 to 10 or 15 years. I think the vast majority of people want a quick fix, the 3-easy-tricks to get there, and then they give up.   . Then there are a few other people actually pursuing my dream. And almost none of them work as hard, but they think they do. I can tell, because I was there also. And yet every day even I find another necessary area I'm slacking in. Nobody you ask will think they're slacking. But if they're not making strides, they are. Be it something obvious like slacking with the time investments necessary (ex. homework in school, or practice in sports), or something elusive like slacking by not investing the mental energy to get shit done (you can go through the motions, but if you don't do the hard stuff, and do it mindfully and intentfully, you just won't reach elite levels - unless your dream is to be a couch potato).   . So... Yeah, most people don't reach their dreams: they either slack or they give up too early. This, they don't deserve to achieve their dreams. Human nature is to become and then to remain complacent, and complacency is the enemy of achievement."

The problem is not that we are encouraging children to develop inspirational ideals; the problem is that the ideals that we are upholding are often flimsy cardboard versions that lack the moral fibre needed to actually achieve anything and this article offers nothing better.     philosopher Aristotle celebrated the value of a meaningful goal when he coined the term eudaimonia   What? Aristotle did not coin the term eudaimonia. How could the author get something like this so wrong?  Plato and Socrates used it as well as pretty much every philosopher and playwrite throughout Greece since the time of Homer.  What Aristotle first coined was an articulation of human excellence that included the beginnings of an outline of some of the moral and intellectual virtues necessary to achieve a flourishing life. That is the kind of language and learning that we are missing, and which is not accounted for in this article.    The difficult talk that we need to have with our children is not about the need to lower their career expectations--let them shoot for the stars if they want to for fuck's sake.  What we need to teach them are the skills needed to build the character necessary to achieve their dreams, such as the ability to endure the fear and frustration of failure and the temptation for shortcuts and endless distractions that naturally arise in the pursuit of anything difficult.  Only by learning this kind of emotional intelligence can we learn to be comfortable within our own limitations, and find ways to thrive within them and to push ourselves beyond them.

I had a mixed reaction to it and it is as follows:  -Eric Geithner is the victim of revenge porn in a way. He thought he was engaged in a private, consensual arrangement for sex and the hired escort, unbeknownst to him, figured out that he was not only the brother of the former US Treasury Secretary but a very powerful man in his own right as the CFO of Conde Nast. The escort  then attempted to curry Eric Geithner's influence in a completely unrelated legal matter, at which point, Eric Geithner wisely backed out of the planned rendez-vous. The spurned escort took the all texts, photos and payment details to Gawker.   This may not be classic revenge porn to some but it fits the description closely enough for me.  -On the other hand, Eric Geithner is a prominent person and is the brother of the former US Treasury secretary so I can also see how this may qualify his reckless behavior for public domain treatment.   In the end, no, I don't care for these kind of exposes as I do think they unnecessarily destroy lives and careers over private, consensual behavior. However, the on-going debate is an interesting one given that Gawker has named and shamed for so long but this time, with this person and this story, they and their readers are having a bit of a think.   Who knows if this editorial controversy is a product of harpooning a whale rather than a guppy but it's a pretty fascinating development that is doing absolutely nothing to keep Eric Geithner's name out of the press at this point."

If developed consumers stopped demanding goods at cheap prices that only sweatshops can deliver, corporations would get out of Bangladesh and Shenzhen and take their capital with them, and the poorest would be put in a far more objectionable position than being in a factory.  People go to sweatshops.  They want to work there.  In my preferred world everyone would give money they make over a living standard to develop economies in the third world, but that's not feasible now.  The next best thing is not stopping what little opportunities come their way, like the opportunity to attract foreign investment and develop for the first time in decades that comes with cheap labor.   Sweatshops have raised standards of living everywhere they've been introduced.

To be clear, I would prefer people didn't buy clothes or any luxuries, and just donated to the worst suffering (those off subsistence farms, not those in sweatshops actually, mostly sub-Saharan Africans not Chinese or ASEAN).

Finally companies could make their billions in profits AND everyone gets a job that's slowly killing them and poisoning the environment for their children!    and just donated to the worst suffering   Sorry, but donations arent going to do shit. Donating is a nice gesture, but it wont fix the fundamental roots of these countries' problems. It is not a solution and it picks up the tab these corporations leave behind.

As we moved to less producing and more consuming we lost more control over the world we live in. Now, as we are making up less of the consumer market, we are going to control even less.   ""Shopping ethically"" is still a solid move, but it is not going to effect a major change.   It is a bit ironic, as i see consumerism the heart of this issue, but the more a culture reduces its consumption the less power it has in the short term. However, that move could lead to better long term outcomes.  A lot of this reminds me of Zizek's take on our future of ""Capitalism with asiatic values"" and the potential divorce of capitalism and democracy."

So much so, that our overall expectations of quality were lowered.   Not just food, but lots of artisan products are succeeding despite a tumultuous economy. There is also an aspect of 'bragging rights' on social media ""hey look at this high quality bacon I got from @SparsButcher"" that helps immensely in marketing as well."

In fact, repercussions for poor teaching is pretty lenient, and all but the worst are able to stay at their jobs.   And it isn't the 'cool creative kid' I'm worried about. I think we've all seen that dude, and he's a humble bragger. What I'm worried about is the kid with adhd who genuinely is intelligent, and can do awesome in the real world no matter his chosen profession, but who can't learn by sitting and listening - the kid who needs to get their hands on things, fuck up a couple times, but comes away knowing everything and having the insight to progress man's knowledge about that thing. Our current system basically tells that kid to fuck off, because you only deserve a semester to learn something and if you don't learn it the way we want then it's off to Walmart you go.   Our system is impatient, selfish and ignorant of a plethora of different life paths. Furthermore, we keep justifying to ourselves that ""it's the best we have"", when in reality we haven't tried anything else because as a society we're too chickenshit. We have something with plenty of success (I do agree, there are a lot of people who work well in this system), and we're more than happy to be complacent with that.

I'm not arguing that some drugs shouldn't be legalized. But legalizing them is not going to magically make everything go away.  There will, of course, be issues. In some cases--marijuana comes to mind--those issues will be very small and it's far, far better to legalize.

EDIT: I just wanted to share this link about organized crime during prohibition.  The increase in crime in the first year of prohibition was astounding.  There have been decades of the war on drugs, with no benefit, extreme costs both to America and the much of the rest of the world.  Look at what it has done to Mexico."

The pharmacological mechanisms underlying the induction of cocaine-associated violence may involve known neurotransmitter systems affected by cocaine. A possible explanation may be that cocaine acts in those areas of the brain, particularly the limbic system, that subserve aggressive and violent behaviors.   Gardner, Eliot L.

There is also an association between alcohol and aggression. I'm sure you would agree that distributors of another aggression-inducing substance should serve jail time. Of course, that's not even bringing other substances like Adderral and Focalin into the discussion. Should purveyors of those drugs be jailed too?"

Foodforthought,3dianc,aRVAthrowaway,2,Thu Jul 16 18:38:34 2015 UTC,"Washington Post:   Her license for a concealed weapon amounted to carrying a gun “in furtherance of a drug conspiracy.”  When she was convicted on one count of seven, prosecutors said her testimony in her defense had been false and therefore an “obstruction of justice.”  Although she was neither the supplier nor the buyer, prosecutors described her as a leader in a drug ring.   Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals:   Jones admitted to carrying a firearm with her on all of her trips to Houston, though she denied ever transporting cocaine during any of those trips. The evidence at trial strongly indicates that Jones did transport cocaine from Houston to Dallas on many occasions. This, coupled with her admission that she was always carrying a firearm on these trips, justifies the two-level enhancement under Caciedo.  Jones also asserts that the district court clearly erred in enhancing her offense level for being the leader/organizer and for obstruction of justice in the form of perjury when she took the stand in her own defense. Neither claim has merit, as the record supports both findings."

What is most interesting about this is that it turns out, and unbeknownst to me, his prof, who was the head of his innovative department, was in fact requiring something precisely along those lines at the time, which for all I know weirded him out or at least undermined his authority in a peculiar way. Another teacher, I would argue with in a most problematic way, a pianist with whom I had lessons. The nature and location, let me call it, of the argument was interesting, while I found a way to realize the disagreeing through the actual music I was playing, which led her literally to exclaim and rave about something I played for her, which she didn't know was a transformation of the disagreement. I'm not sure it proved my point exactly, but the grounds of authority are often not what people think they are. The problematic of authority and defiance in the psychiatric context is fragile and at times pretty disgusting. To say the least. But so does it go in quite a number of areas, perhaps in a way everywhere. But then there is always power, to which many make futile, if decisive and at times effective, recourse. It is at least a little reassuring to know that some things remain utterly untouched by power, crumple beneath it, or limp under it's burden. Likewise, there are certain things, big and small, that point, more or less permanently, in the direction of this other authority. No, not some authority of god, something far more omnipresent than that: the good. We can only be servants of the good. All authority is beholden to this and knows it, comfortably or not.

Foodforthought,3dhew9,eaturbrainz,10,Thu Jul 16 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"I found this a thoughtful and well-written article about a vital insight rare in the 21st century.  There is also a flip side to this that didn't get as much discussion -- irrational compliance.  I'm not even sure we really have clinical criteria for people who cause harm to themselves or others in the name of following the rules.  Yet the behavior is far too common.    Of course, a certain amount of harm in the form of law enforcement actions and legal penalties is rational.  We don't have better alternatives to restraining menaces and punishing criminals.  Yet so much damage is done by people who are compulsively compliant with authorities.  Ratting out a corporate embezzler who is undermining the solvency of a business that employs many others may be a perfectly rational action that ultimately does more good than harm.  Filing a report on a colleague who used an office stapler to attach two documents unrelated to work is insane, but how would that sort of insane behavior be classified?    Is there any clinical basis for recognizing it as such?  Yet part of the misery of working life in America is the expectations of ultra-conformists hostile to even the most trivial displays of disloyalty or individuality.  I should imagine this would be a fertile field for finding people in need of help, but identifying overly authoritarian thinkers and taking steps to help them find a more balanced perspective doesn't seem to be something psychiatry as a discipline can be bothered to do (save for delusional maniacs, of course.)"

I really need help but I can't go to any ""professionals"" because they caused this. I feel like I've had my balls chopped off. I'm an in-shape attractive Australian male living in the U.S and they've turned me into a freak. I feel like I gave up my life, my identity, my character, my relationships, and it makes me look like the bad guy. All my personal notes over the four years are me attacking myself, feeling awful for being mentally sick, and so on. I'm surprised I haven't killed myself to be honest. The loans, the pills I was on, It's been over a year since I've taken any pills (I was on the maximum dosage of Vyvanse and Prozac) the destroyed relationships. I'm slowly coming out of a shell but it is horrifying, I have a difficult time remembering my days and I am certainly not doing anything of value. I am depressed and I want to go back in time, I don't know how to change myself or participate constructively. I was given aptitude tests that said I would never be this or that, that I'd never be a leader, it is all fucked. But this has to get out into cyberspace.

Foodforthought,3dhew9,PM_ME_UR_OBSIDIAN,2,Fri Jul 17 08:05:38 2015 UTC,"It's hard to explain. I went a long time without engaging my world properly. It was a real issue with giving and caring.  Being a coward was killing me and I knew it, but it is easier to be that way than to be anything else, and being that way used to cause severe anxiety and dread, a feeling that I'm wasting my life, and the feelings were pushing me to go out and do something, then I didn't go out and I didn't do a thing, the feeling became less pronounced, I started to coast, and I built poor habits. Sort of like not going to the gym and then bemoaning my fatness.   I developed severe paranoia on Vyvanse and Prozac that trained me to act in a particular way, which didn't immediately cease when I stopped the medication. I was severely apathetic and depressed when I stopped. I did it cold turkey, which was wrong, I thought I could muscle through it. And I did. There was a cost though, I barely remember that time in my life.   I stopped talking to people and they stopped talking to me. I guess they saw it as me needing some sort of breathing room for a while. But it entered a period of ridiculousness when I failed to came back. AWOL. I failed to maintain my solid, expressive character. My skill set, relationships. Under the pressure and abuse I didn't see the value in myself anymore, and without that I couldn't communicate to anyone that they are worth something. I didn't see the value in the college I was killing myself to attend, either.   I've always been the one deciding how I respond to these events and how I project myself, so I feel like I ran an experiment on myself and my environment for way too long. I was hurting the people that I actually wanted to love. That was the epitome of my immaturity. I was not happy, but there was a perk that I got out of it that reinforced my masochistic behavior. It was the extra time to passively consume media with a lack of responsibilities.    I can trust professionals. It's just difficult after bad experiences. I can't afford to go from doctor to doctor and I wouldn't know where to begin.  But at the end of the days now, I am better and continue to improve. It's a drop in the bucket to what could have been achieved over four years, but I am getting better. I act with more empathy, seeing the world through the eyes of the friends that I abandoned. It's a longer and more difficult road that I'm on now, I have lots of work to do to regain the trust and respect of my peers.   I have not openly apologized or explained anything to anyone. I am on the fence about it, and I think about it more often than his helpful. I'm going from cold, distant and nihilistic to a more open, adventurous and artistic way of living, which if done successfully will be it's own form of apology. For the most part I'm doing alright, I am getting better at it.   I was numb to both sadness and happiness; emotionally muted.  It made relating to anything impossible. Understanding and breaking free from this is not easy. I feel safer and more confident and I haven't had to take any meds, although I drink more coffee than I'd consider appropriate. I have a girlfriend who suspects something was wrong, but she is okay with it because I'm improving tenfold. I no longer think I'm the crazy one and I no longer doubt myself, which was the fundamental problem and the injury I was inflicted with in 2011. I'm learning a new way of life as well as learning to forgive myself for my whack behavior over the past four years. Anyway, thanks for reading, this was great to get out of my head."

There is a historical relationship between the us military and american psychology such that many of us are trained in the veterans administration system and the authoritarian tradition there is fully intact.  There are also pressures to conform to 'evidence based' practice, which, while it sounds good ends up being entirely too rigid.

If we cut down on the insanities of industrial agriculture in the US and stopped growing continents full of tasteless corn to pulverize into sugar substitutes for carbonated garbage, I daresay that would be a good first step.

My wife is a big advocate of permaculture and has worked on farms. She has studied these things intensively (and -- for the record -- has a PHD in biochemistry), and is fiercely opposed to GMOs. Still, I don't really know much about them myself, and I never want to be a prisoner to ideology. (Neither does my wife.)   It feels like we're being forced to side with huge global corporations on the one hand, or occasionally-fanatical anti-biotech movements on the other. I recently came across this article about Vandana Shiva that is giving me lots more to think about.   Suffice it to say that these issues are very complex, and it's necessary for us to all be open and honest as we try to sift through them.  Edit: This piece from the NYT ""DealBook"" has some interesting points to make:   the technological salvation argument we faced in finance is also present with G.M.O.s, which are intended to “save children by providing them with vitamin-enriched rice.” The argument’s flaw is obvious: In a complex system, we do not know the causal chain, and it is better to solve a problem by the simplest method, and one that is unlikely to cause a bigger problem.   Edit #2: Another good piece from the NYT about Hawaii's consideration of GMOs.   But the groundswell against genetically modified food has rankled many scientists, who argue that opponents of G.M.O.s have distorted the risks associated with them and underplayed the risks of failing to try to use the technology to improve how food is grown. Wading into a debate that has more typically pitted activists against industry, some have argued that opposition from even small pockets of an American elite influences investment in research and the deployment of genetically modified crops, particularly in the developing world, where hunger raises the stakes."

Actually it's a bit closer to the truth than you'd imagine. Definitely not laughable.  This particular point has nothing to do with food shortages as a general concept - but a specific nutrient deficiency.   It is fairly well established that many hundreds thousands of children, primarily in South East Asia, suffer from severe vitamin-A deficiency associated blindness and other complications. And that government supplementation programs (championed by Greenpeace and other anti-GMO organisations) have been wholly ineffective in preventing this.  Anti-GMO groups have been very successful in preventing the deployment of Golden Rice.  Here is a peer-reviewed study which suggests that the non-adoption of Golden Rice has lead to ""about 71,600 child deaths annually"" in India ALONE since 2002  Not really laughable is it."

The solution to prevent those deaths already exists for free and is only halted by the anti-GMO crowd.

They've effectively created a condition of regulatory capture and they've gained undue influence over academia with large donations to agricultural departments all over the world.

No, because there are actual laws that require this much testing.

Foodforthought,3de928,kontra5,0,Wed Jul 15 22:06:05 2015 UTC,"The solution to prevent those deaths already exists for free and is only halted by the anti-GMO crowd.   You realize that's not true, right?  The lack of nutrients people have in various places isn't due to a lack of GMOs.  It's due to lack of dispersal of the food we already have.  And that's due to a lack of will on the part of those with the power to distribute food to those who need it.  The world spends roughly $1.5 Trillion on military expenditures each year and the UN estimates that it would cost a small fraction of that ($30 Billion) to wipe out world hunger.  And vitamin A deficiency is only one nutrient that people aren't given access to.  But again, it's not due to a lack of that nutrient in foods that already exist.    The real problem is artificially inflated food prices -- due to waste and, more recently, turning hundreds of millions of tons of crops into fuel.  If food prices were not inflated in such a manner, and if people were given access to a wide variety of foods, then the issue of various deficiencies would cease.     I think it's fair to give at least partial blame to Greenpeace for preventing golden rice from reaching the market, and indirectly causing hundreds of thousands of deaths.   There are much more serious factors at play which prevent people around the world from having access to the nutritious food they need.  Demonizing an environmentalist group which has concerns that aren't really being addressed... isn't helping.  The comparison between Mao and Greenpeace is more than a little strained."
Foodforthought,3de928,Epistaxis,4,Thu Jul 16 05:19:03 2015 UTC,"It is 100% true. Thousands of kids go blind due to vitamin A deficiency, many of which ultimately die. Golden rice was developed specifically to combat this and be given to farmers for free.   Food dispersion takes money, so getting that food to very poor areas, like the ones afflicted with vitamin A deficiency, is unlikely. Replacing an already staple crop, rice, with a new form doesn't increase cost to the consumer at the end.   There are much more serious factors at play which prevent people around the world from having access to the nutritious food they need. Demonizing an environmentalist group which has concerns that aren't really being addressed... isn't helping. The comparison between Mao and Greenpeace is more than a little strained.   Greenpeace is obstructing the dispersal of golden rice and spreading misinformation over concerns that are scientifically invalid, based on nothing but ideology. They are knowingly preventing those children from obtaining a cure. Mao at least had no idea that killing the birds would lead to the famine, but is still held accountable for his actions."

Brassica is a good example. Broccoli, kale, cabbage, kohlrabi, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, etc., are all one species, selectively bred for traits. Those traits already existed in the natural, wild plant...they were just not presenting. Teeth in chicken beaks. Six toes in humans.  Monoculture goes down a whole different road. Whole species can easily disappear, and who knows what sorts of genetic uniqueness they were hiding inside? I think the health risk arguments of GMOs are for the most part unfounded, although I'm sure at some point we will do something stupid (as a species) with a GMO that will have unexpected negative effects. We do unexpectedly stupid things all the time.  The real problem is the way agribusiness works today, and this mentality that we must do it that way, or the world will starve.

Natural intelligence has so far not killed everything, so you could argue that AI is safe. But really, we don't have a context to say for sure, and it makes sense to treat lightly in those waters, because it's fundamentally different. It doesn't have hundreds of millions of years of empirical evidence to fall back on. It's concept and theory.

The judge could not account for how a few wayward seeds or pollen grains could come to dominate hundreds of acres without Mr Schmeiser’s active participation, saying ‘...none of the suggested sources could reasonably explain the concentration or extent of Roundup Ready canola of a commercial quality evident from the results of tests on Schmeiser’s crop’   But of course you're an organic farmer, a practice that is so full of lies and misinformation that I would argue it is far worse than any GM activity."

Maybe there were some in there, but honestly, it came across just like those people who say ""thousands of scientists"" agree that climate change evidence is inconclusive.   If we could get some real studies on real people about GMO consumption, that would be one thing, but the reality is, most of the studies are extremely narrow in their focus (as studies usually should be), and they are often not appropriate to include in a list of ""studies that show GMOs are safe"" when that isn't what they show. It's disingenuous, misleading, and it begs the question: If the evidence is so clearly in favor of GMOs being safe, why doesn't anyone actually provide that evidence, rather than these BS ""thousands of studies"" claims that, when examined, fall flat at even the most cursory of investigation?"

The industry has engrained itself so deeply within the university system that many agriculture departments depend upon the industry for grants and other funding.  This is quite arguably effects the impartiality of university agriculture programs in terms of what they research and how dissenting voices are received.  At the same time, the industry restricts independent research by means of patents.    Any of the above issues should be alarming.  But as a multi-billion dollar, multi-national industry, corporate agribusiness has also exhibited a remarkable ability to control its media image.  This undoubtedly extends to the realm of social media.    The primary difference between the biotech industry and the fossil fuel industry is that the former seemingly had more justification for making heavy donations to agriculture departments while the latter would be hard-pressed to justify making large donations to departments researching climate science.  And without the seeming legitimacy granted by ""impartial"" academic bodies, control over the regulatory bodies and the media would have been much harder.  If the fossil fuel industry had invested heavily in climate science researchers 40 years ago... most people today would probably be denying the existence of anthropogenic climate change."

The longest trial here is 2 years in an animal (cows) that lives considerably longer than that.   To quote one of the better studies (of these you linked), though:   However, the evidence is still far from proving whether the long-term consumption of GM foods posses a possible danger for human or animal health."
Foodforthought,3de928,benpatient,4,Thu Jul 16 06:28:40 2015 UTC,"Several thousand studies is a lot of weight in the scientific community, especially when they all find similar things in both independent and industry funded studies.  It's just like climate change. The vast majority of papers, hundreds of them, agree that climate change is happening and it's man-made.   The amount of papers represents the amount of studies, experiments, and models. A couple of studies that are poorly implemented can give false results. Hundreds or thousands of studies? Not so much.  The scientific consensus on the safety of GMOs is stronger than the scientific consensus on climate change."
Foodforthought,3de928,Vellon221,0,Thu Jul 16 00:18:55 2015 UTC,"GMOs have been studied for over 25 years.    In the wild? Millions of acres of them?  You're only considering factors that happen to favour your preconceived opinions.  Ecosystems are inherently closed - surrounded by ocean or vacuum, for example - and at any scale larger than a glass jar they're so complex that their ripple effects and feedback loops are unpredictable.  Introducing new species should be done very cautiously - in the 1970's everyone thought it was a great idea to import asian carp and to use them for cleaning the scum of fisheries' ponds  I'm pretty sure that was approved by appropriate federal fisheries, agriculture or wildlife departments, but now the asian carp is pretty much endemic to the USA.  I mean, you can call it an epidemic, if you like, but how do you propose eradicating this species? No one else is succeeding at it.  The top comment in this thread is about ""the problem is usually not lack of food, but our ability (and willingness) to get it to the people who need it the most"" - I'd appreciate it if you could go argue with that and prove that we need GMO's before you go polluting the environment.  Ultimately, wise husbandry of our planet will take second place to what turns a profit, and that's pretty sad."
Foodforthought,3de928,makmak3,2,Thu Jul 16 10:17:49 2015 UTC,"I take a skeptical approach to everything and defer to what the science says on issues. Right now, the science on GMOs is abundantly clear that they are safe and pose no additional threat to the environment. Any other stance is one that is not supported by evidence, and not one I consider valid.  GMOs have already shown to be more beneficial to the environment than other forms of growing crops. Bt crops need less pesticides, so less pesticides are killing important things like bees and running off into water sources. Glyphosate is more environmentally friendly than other herbicides.  I'll change my stance on the issue when new valid evidence is brought onto the table, and I'll respect whatever the scientific consensus is on the issue."
Foodforthought,3de928,Vellon221,3,Thu Jul 16 18:50:14 2015 UTC,"GMOs are good for the environment for other reasons, however, such as water conservation and reducing the use of pesticides and herbicides.  http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-11-18/how-gmo-crops-can-be-good-for-the-environment"
Foodforthought,3de928,homageofreason,2,Wed Jul 15 19:01:32 2015 UTC,In this article the author discussed the fact that GMOs have significantly increased the use of herbicides.

Foodforthought,3de928,JF_Queeny,8,Wed Jul 15 21:58:25 2015 UTC,"More glyphosate is used, yes, instead of other herbicides.  Other herbicides which remain in the soil much longer, are more toxic, and contaminate the environment.  Overall herbicide use is relatively unaffected in first world countries.  I'd gladly have my neighbor spraying glyphosate than other herbicides.  In the third world, where access to agricultural chemicals is much less, you see some interesting results.  Chemical use has stalled while yields have gone up."

But the article would be so much better than it is, if it would not do itself what it accuses others of: hide or downplay evidence to the contrary.   From the article :   Despite an ongoing debate about the effects of glyphosate,  experts agree that it’s relatively benign. Benbrook has called  it one of the safest herbicides on the market.   Benbrook might very well say that, but experts don't agree.    In March 2015 the World Health Organization's International  Agency for Research on Cancer published a summary of its  forthcoming monograph on glyphosate, and classified it as  ""probably carcinogenic in humans"" (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies.

Foodforthought,3de928,makmak3,4,Wed Jul 15 18:01:06 2015 UTC,"Are you being intentionally obtuse? The PDF you linked to lists 117 known carcinogens, (group 1), 74 that are more than likely carcinogens, but not certainly (group 2A), 287 possible, but low likelihood (group 2B) and 503 ""not classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans"" (group 3).   Group 3 items are all listed in that PDF, and they are all assumed safe. The Group 1 and Group 2A items are the ones to worry about. Most of the Group 1 items aren't found outside of industrial sectors, or biomedical research/testing, or controlled substances (like alcohol). Group 2A is the real area of contention, because there is often a lot of money behind the chemicals in this group, and the conclusions as to their cancer-causing abilities aren't as clear-cut as we would like.  Glysophate (roundup) got put into this group this year, and Monsanto went straight off the deep end in combating the results.   I notice you chose to link to the alpha order PDF, rather than the one done by group first, which would make the results much easier to understand and find value in.  link  Now, if you look at that version, you see things like asbestos, benzine, arsenic, chromium, formaldehyde, PCBs, plutonium, radium, thorium, gamma radiation, shale oil, etc. Those are the ones we have no question about. Move to group 2A and you have the most interesting information on this document."
Foodforthought,3de928,dtiftw,23,Wed Jul 15 19:36:53 2015 UTC,"Lots of stuff is in the ""probably carcinogenic in humans"" category.  Almost every herbicide/pesticide is, the ones that aren't probably just haven't been studied enough yet.  There's shit in your shampoo, soap, body spray, whatever, in this category.  Shit the oxygen in the air is in this category.  Glyphosate however has one of the lowest rates of run-off, it binds to the ground underneath it very strongly.  This means there is very little run-off and environmental exposure.  That means ground and surface water don't get contaminated, which is the important thing.  The amount you're exposed to via the corn absorbing it is very low.  Pesticides/herbicides leeching into the drinking water is the dangerous thing, and glyphosate is amazing for that.  If you spray it on fucking concrete, only 24% will run off."
Foodforthought,3de928,benpatient,12,Wed Jul 15 17:36:28 2015 UTC,"You obviously didn't read the nature article I linked, as they specifically address your point.  Why? Because that was exactly the reply from Monsanto:   Monsanto said in its statement, “IARC has classified numerous  everyday items in Category 2 including coffee, cell phones, aloe vera  extract and pickled vegetables,....” But the IARC classified most of these items at the less dangerous  2B level, whereas glyphosate is in the 'probably carcinogenic' 2A  category.   And please Check the list for yourself : http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/vol1_113.php No oxygen on the list! What is listed is ""Outdoor air pollution"", but if you mean that, I think you have a pretty weak point."
Foodforthought,3de928,faustoc4,13,Wed Jul 15 18:07:46 2015 UTC,"I read every article before I comment on it.  Oxygen in general creates free radicals, which are very prominent in the creation of cancer cells in the body.  Hence anti-oxidants being good.  Again there are numerous herbicides and pesticides at (or even above) the 2A level.  The important thing is how much we are exposed to them, and Glyphosate used on crops leads to very little human exposure.  We probably shouldn't be dumping it out of the air on coca fields, but using it as an herbicide remains quite safe.  And the 2A categorization has wildly varying criteria.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_2A_carcinogens In the case of Glyphosate it was given a 2A rating based on, ""Glyphosate has been linked to tumours in mice and rats — and there is also what the IARC classifies as ‘mechanistic evidence’, such as DNA damage to human cells from exposure to glyphosate.""  despite the fact that, ""Although several studies have shown that people who work with the herbicide seem to be at increased risk of a cancer type called non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the report notes that a separate huge US study, the Agricultural Health Study, found no link to non-Hodgkin lymphomas. That study followed thousands of farmers and looked at whether they had increased risk of cancer.""  EDIT: It's also worth pointing out that lymphoma is one of the least dangerous types of cancer.  A substance causing cancer in animals when exposed to high levels is the weakest evidence for how much it will cause cancer.  The fact that two government studies found either very minimal or no increased risk of cancer in studies that followed thousands of farmers who work with the chemical, leads me to have literally zero worry about the tiny amount I will be exposed to in my food.  And since there is almost 0 water table exposure, I say bring on the Glyphosate.  All of which is completely tangential to the actual issue of GMO safety."

This reasoning does not make a strong argument.  You want me to side with you because of what Greenpeace, Anti-GMOs groups, and Chipotle said falsely? I can barely afford their damn $10 burrito, man, these aren't even my people.   GMOs are a part of the problem, you already stated this in your article. It really is becoming an arms race... And that's where I want to part away from your position.   We really can ""end this debate"" by adding the labeling of foods. Let the crazy people be crazy and eat their organic food, while you eat your GMOs. Science experiment time, guys!   The whole point in choosing more organic foods is to gets us more consciously aware of how are food is being treated or taken care of. That's one of the factors in my decision. Demand and supply?   After we become more conscious of our food, we won't settle for pesticide use either. Which brings me to my next point... We will be more conscious of our environment. I understand your belief in thinking this is backward, but if you side with GMOs concerns about environment might be too far behind you to integrate. As in, you already made GMOs that might not work in any environment system than what it was engineered for. ie, it will always be in a disharmony with the nature around it and always fighting or killing it. Instead of being more concerned about how drought-tolerant our corn is via genetics, btw, the Hopis have lived off of corn in the Arizona deserts for centuries now, we should learn how to farm the land better.   The U.S. always touts that it could feed the world ten times over (hyperbole). The truth is the U.S. doesn't know how to properly farm its own land and have been using pesticides and herbicides to get by for far too long. Secondly, we live in a capitalistic system. Third, we haven't mastered transportation. We're still driving around in death machines. So we won't be 'sending food off to save lives nor to sustain it' very often in other countries.   Permaculture, although an annoying buzzword, is something worth diving into and that is where I hope this whole non-GMO movement goes. It's about making steps into the right direction. Things don't happen over night. I think as we explore how important biodiversity is we can look at food differently, not for the way it looks or how it never goes brown, but how it all falls in place with one another in its cycle or environment.  Btw, I do not look forward to non-browning Apples. They brown for a reason.

Not an argument against GMOs and patent concerns (which are overblown i.e. the innocent farmers being sued - demonstrably false).  You want to have an argument about the ins and outs of capitalism, intellectual property, government and private funding for research and return on investment, fine. But in the context of an argument about the safety of GMOs, it's a bit of a straw man.   Equally you should, to be logically consistent, be against the implementation of gene editing technologies, biologic therapies and the like because they inevitably (for implementation) require patents.   Ultimately I'd agree with you - I think it's analogous to the argument against 'Big Pharma'. It confuses me as to why on earth we demonise the company for acting consistently in its interests within the bounds of the financial system it operates in (well it doesn't confuse me, but it's less productive I think).

We are playing catch-up as a society with so many things, and we don't know the effects of these decisions for quite some time.

A rough analogy would be people demanding to know which cars were designed using CAD (computer aided design) instead of paper blueprints. It makes no difference in the end product, other than it's much more efficient to design a car on a computer instead of paper.

The synthetic pesticide Captan is 32.5 times less toxic than Rotenone, and another one, Pyrimethanil, is 42.5 times less toxic than Rotenone. Rotenone is also not the only natural pesticide that out-ranks synthetic pesticides in terms of toxicity.

To me, empathy is when you feel other people's feelings almost as if they were your own. You feel a portion of their feelings. If you see someone happy, it makes you happy. If you see someone sad, or see someone encounter misfortune, you feel bad. It's like you're connected with the person, on an emotional level. Now I don't see how someone in that position can then go and do something bad to another person. If they do, they obviously don't have empathy - an emotional connection - with that person. I don't think an empathetic person would ever want to be malicious. I think people can only be malicious when they cut themselves off from empathy."

This is a very important and much neglected skill that we finally seem to be beginning to recover after centuries of the belief that mental and emotional health considerations are morally irrelevant.  All the examples of emotional intelligence in the article have to do with persuading others.  Proficiency in that realm first requires that we know ourselves, and if we fail at that, and we are somehow encouraged to harbour dark secrets from ourselves, that's the beginning of the emotional manipulation that the article correctly forebodes.

He ignores so many different ways and types of art, and shits on any art that the crowd deems worthy.    His arguments fall flat-he says Weiwei will be successful, but what if another less famous artist was pushed? Well, they'd have the same struggle if they pursued finance through government or individuals, Kickstarter is not unique in that regard.  Art is not solely an individualistic activity.  Art can be cultural and it can be popular.  Also, people can donate to artistic endeavors that they may not like because they like the idea of an endeavor.  I contributed to a kickstarter for a mural on some silos in OKC, but I did not like the style of the art.  I did like the endeavor.  And, holy shit, he asks 'Where exactly, in history, are these wise crowds?' and then cherry picks three events when people were unwise.

People in the U.S. were victims of propaganda too.  Of course it's not the same as the Holocaust, but what about the internment of Japanese Americans and German Americans?

Foodforthought,3d9qjp,rolfraikou,6,Tue Jul 14 19:18:00 2015 UTC,"Orders are orders.   Dangerous words, and ones uttered by many men throughout history with horrifying consequences. There may come a time in many people's lives where the very fiber of morality demands that they make a decision that will come at a significant personal cost. In the case of Auschwitz, I think we can all agree that any good person should have abandoned their post at all costs had they come to know what purpose they were serving.  That being said however; Germany is a tough case because of the total indoctrination of society. German society had seen a significant decline following WW1, and Hitler was a very lucrative leader for Germans because of his passion and promises of a new Germany that he rapidly delivered upon following his assumption of power. By the time Auschwitz had been built the Nazi's had been reigning for 7 years, and Germany was embroiled in a difficult war. Essentially this unusual combination of factors led to a significant decline in most of German society's morals and/or ability to fight the regime (Hitler survived many assassination attempts, several of which were very well planned conspiracies).  So the questions becomes, where do you start and where do you end? We could arguably have prosecuted most of the German adults of the time, because most were complicit in some way. By current moral standards rebellion would be the only ethical path to take, and failure to do so would be considered immoral.  But that's obviously not feasible and when it comes down to it, the problem has been effectively corrected through other means and so no longer poses a threat. Despite the fact that only a relatively small amount of people have been prosecuted (mostly high in command officers or those directly involved in abuses), Nazism has seen a significant decline compared to Nazi Germany."

Foodforthought,3d9qjp,louieanderson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:24:43 2015 UTC,"People have an amazing ability to compartmentalize and rationalize anything accepted as normal or presented as correct by authority.   First, consider the infamous Milgram obedience experiment. Almost two thirds of participants were willing to inflict a fatal shock on the unseen other participant. Although almost all of them questioned whether it was right, after being both assured that they wouldn't be held responsible for the other person's injuries and ordered to continue, they did. Consider further that these were just people who showed up one day to some psychologist's lab; they weren't trained soldiers ordered to be there, and even so, only about a third of participants refused to torture and kill a stranger on the next room. Really let that sink in.  Next: do you live in a city? Have you been to a major city? Think of all the homeless people you pass. Do you help them? These people are really suffering. They're right there in front of you, but you learn to ignore them and pass them by. You compartmentalize: don't make eye contact, look away, walk faster to get past. You rationalize: you can't help them all, they'll just blow it on booze, they could go to a shelter instead of asking you for help. After a while, these people hardly register. It's normal to see miserable, sick, destitute people living on the street. Obviously this isn't comparable with a death camp, but it's easy to imagine that given how easy it is to deal with that level of human suffering, one could apply those same faculties to deal with guarding a death camp.  And all of that is even before issues of personal survival in a war-torn country. It is a very unusual person who joins the resistance, perhaps even pathological in a way. You just can't expect everyday people to reject their society, everything they're told is right and proper, and endanger their careers, well being, and perhaps even lives in the service of some other ideal. It's amazing when it happens, but it's totally unreasonable to demand of people. And remember, when you reject society in the name of a greater ideal there's no guarantee that what you do will be praiseworthy. See, for example, the Unabomber, the Massachusetts Puritans, and (depending on who you ask - this is always the key!) Edward Snowden."

Part of my issue with this is that there seems to be no rationality to the ""charges"". It's just like being a Nazi makes you Hitler and fully responsible for the genocide. If there was a charge that someone put together for being a guard at a concentration camp who wasn't involved in the killings and came with a specific sentence then charge him with that.

Foodforthought,3d9qjp,ByronicAsian,2,Wed Jul 15 08:42:56 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to argue that his role didn't play a part in the killing.   Oskar Groening was a member of the Waffen-SS. You didn't get forcefully conscripted into it until much later in the war, and Groening joined it in 1940, voluntarily.   He received orders to report to the commandant of Auschwitz in 1942 after being told that his desk job would be reserved for an injured veteran. At that time, the commandant was a man named Rudolf Höss, a name that the world would become unfortunately intimately familiar with post-war.   Groening was responsible for sorting through the confiscated possessions and money of people arriving at the camp. Effectively, his duties in the camp consisted of retrieving, guarding and then sorting through the items that the deportees had. Once he had sorted through all of it, his responsibility was also to pack and send the varied currencies to Berlin. While his initial objections to the extermination at Auschwitz were also noted by his superiors, it has to be put out there that the guy didn't actually object at the extermination of Jews. He simply objected to the way it was being done, as he had witnessed an incident involving an SS guard's boot meeting a baby left on the arrival ramp which resulted him complaining to his superior officer. His complaint was rejected.   To quote Groening: ""If the extermination of Jews is necessary, it should be done within a certain framework.""   Once he had witnessed the gassing and burning of prisoner bodies, Groening decided that he had had enough and approached one of his superiors again, raising a complaint. The apparent result of this complaint was that Groening was reminded of the oath he gave and then returned to work.   Groening transferred to an SS combat unit in 1944, by his own request, and was wounded while performing battlefield duties there. When his unit surrendered in 1945, he declared to the British that his prior duty station before combat duties was the SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt, the SS main economic and administrative department. His justification for this was that ""the winners are always right"" and that ""the things that happened at Auschwitz did not always comply with human rights.""   You can decide for yourself if Groening is guilty of accessory to murder, but to me, he always knew that he was considering the way he treated the matter post war. He certainly felt that he was responsible based on the false information that he provided the British about what he had done, and during family dinners post war insisted that Auschwitz never be mentioned in the same sentence with his name.   To me, Groening is a war criminal. He may have carried out his duties as requested and there was certainly the possibility of punishment or reassignment if he objected, but I doubt that he would have been outright shot on the spot for wanting to leave. Because that's ultimately what he ended up doing, but only after working at the camp for 2 years. All this, combined with the knowledge that his fear of responsibility seemed to have far outweighed his fear of death considering his combat post after Auschwitz, and the lies he told to cover up his immediate past, speak more about the guy than what he himself says.   It is a shame that the judgment came so late, and while he regrets his actions now, they cannot be dismissed based on the fact that he was told by others to do thus."

They had real power; they could have steered things a different way. Therefore they bear moral responsibility. Rank and file soldiers can reasonably use the defense that they were following orders, and have, successfully, in other war crimes trials.   Also in the quotation, you're leaving out what happened next: his trusted military superior assured him that such abuses weren't the norm, that everything was above board, and that he shouldn't concern himself with it. You're severely underestimating how powerful an effect that can have. It's a kind of supercharged version of Milgram's experiment. Someone he was conditioned to trust was telling him that abuses he was only helping, not directly committing, were okay.   Regarding my homeless people analogy, no, you're not part of a cabal with your friends to keep hobos on the streets, but neither was this man part of a cabal with his friends to run death camps. We're not talking about a cabinet minister, we're talking about an army private. You can't ask a low ranking soldier to disobey orders or desert when they're sanctioned by everyone all the way up the chain of command.

Foodforthought,3d9qfs,CollumMcJingleballs,13,Tue Jul 14 16:32:42 2015 UTC,"Sample of shit you'll find on ArticleCity. The article is called How to Become Famous like Justin Bieber:   Do you want to become famous? And do you want to become famous like Justin Bieber did? Well what if I was to tell you that it's not actually that hard to do?   Bieber may be too criticized by many but is a great example of what the marketing, social networking and other elements can do.   First Bieber began releasing their videos through YouTube, a platform that has given 5 minutes of fame to many people, but these 5 minutes stretched into years due to other internet tools... Twitter.   If we learn from the biography of Justin Bieber is that if someone wants to become famous, should begin now to put their videos (as real as possible) on YouTube, because you never know who might ""accidentally"" discover your talent for delight the young fans. This is exactly what has happened to Justin Bieber.   Twitter really help Bieber began to attract attention from your target market. Many marketers still do not understand the scope that is Twitter users and yet this was the platform that Justin used to engage with your audience. Justin currently offer your movie called ""Never Say Never"" (never say never), a type of documentary which presents the story of the singer and how he came to where he is now.   And of course had to take a perfume especially for girls called ""someday"" but the video is a little weird and may even get you a laugh, in two days has reached the 2 million views. A very good example is Google; that is starting to become obsessed with the pop stars. This search engine company has made a change in its marketing strategy. Last month, he joined Lady Gaga in an ad to show all the opportunities offered by the Chrome browser. Now he has done the same with Justin Bieber.   The announcement is similar to Gaga, but also shares some similarities with the recent announcement Dear Sophie, which shows a father using Chrome and other Google products to remember her daughter's childhood.   It makes sense that Google has thought Bieber for their promotion. The young celebrity was discovered thanks to his performances uploaded to Youtube. And with it, Google manages to reach an important demographic: teenage girls.   One of his secrets: Its well-defined market.   Justin Bieber is not intended that all are his fans; he knows it would be almost impossible, yet the market for young girls have it well controlled. So it adds the elements of marketing, good use of digital tools and a well-defined market and the rest is history."

All of this hurts good people, lowers the quality of debate, distorts our understanding of the problems we confront, and harms the process of democratic deliberation.   The article doesn't say why we have these culture wars. There are hints at a decline story--we used to compromise more, but now we have fallen.  I don't buy it. Social conflict is real. If another group is trying to deny you the right to marry, or assert the right to kill people in your group with impunity, that is grounds for war. On the other side of the (American) political spectrum, small towns, the influence of religion, and an entire way of life are fading away. I don't expect anyone to compromise with their would-be oppressors and destroyers, I expect them to fight by all means fair and foul."

Is it this:   However, distasteful it may be to say so, perhaps the ends can justify the means in truly urgent circumstances.  But even if we accept that much, what kind of society will we be living in if this approach becomes normalised? Do we want a cultural and political environment where intellectual dishonesty, social destruction of individuals, and pressures to engage in tribal displays (shows of ideological purity and of a willingness to adopt extreme views) become the daily currency of social interaction?   There's not a lot there. Pressures to engage in tribal displays in daily life are lower than they've been in hundreds of years. Social destruction of individuals happens, but it probably happened even more in the past. It wasn't so easy to become internationally demonized, but it was very easy to be abused or ostracized. I'm sure the people close to a person are still much more of a danger than the always irrationally feared mass of strangers."

Members were angry over the changes to the site and the broken software, but they had every reason to believe the problems would eventually get fixed, but when the last faithful members discovered Kevin had given up on the site, they gave up as well."
Foodforthought,3d8wc9,headzoo,3,Tue Jul 14 22:17:32 2015 UTC,"For me, it was when they covered the front page in what was essentially paid ads with artificial diggs.  I don't even remember that bit about Kevin Rose.  That said, the claims that what happened to Digg won't happen to Reddit are pretty naive.  I'm willing to bet that with the recent peak in frustration, there's numerous people out there right now working on an alternative.  Like Digg, Reddit's major failing is that they don't realize how unnecessary they are.  I've seen all kinds of user-content sites fail and be replaced almost instantaneously with equivalent or better alternatives.  Reddit may be bigger by far, but is by no means immune to this weakness.  The internet could easily replace this site with another, and everybody's lives will go on."

The thing that drove me to leave Digg was the broken comment system. At this point I can't even remember what exactly was broken, but the comments were quite unusable, and they stayed that way for more than a month. I think I had already left by the time Digg v4 was rolled out.  The biggest challenge I see for any reddit alternative is building up a user base. No one wants to use a site no one is using. Similarly, everyone seems to hate Facebook, but there's no where else to go because everyone is already on Facebook. Anyone trying to bootstrap a new social site should probably invest some money in a service like Amazon Mechanical Turk, and create a lot of fake activity."

I'm polyamorous, so I have multiple gfs but if you put them side by side you'd be hard pressed to see much in common with any of them, because there's not really.   It is really hard for me to peg celebrities so as a result every movie is completely different and I don't really judge actors by their careers.

There are times when I can't see peoples' faces at all. The best I can describe it is that it's similar to when you're outside in the bright sun and you come into a dark room and can't really see things clearly at first. It's not exactly like that but that's the most accurate I can describe it.   Most of the time I can see faces but, like you said, if I look away for a couple seconds I don't remember what they look like. I tend to find women with exaggerated features more attractive because they're easier to picture in my mind. If I know the girl has a big nose I can picture what I think she looks like then add the nose to that face and then, when I look at her again, she looks more like I pictured than if she had plain features. This is a big reason why I started hanging out with the punk rockers in high school.  If anyone's is wearing similar clothes - especially uniforms - I can only recognize them by their voices. When I meet somebody new it takes a few weeks to really know their voice. I suppose hair helps a little but I don't really notice when women change their hair.

Pay is pretty meh for entry level jobs, see this ad for an example. $15 might sound like a lot, but that's dogshit in Melbourne where rent is typically $350+ a week and living expenses are high. You also spend most of your day getting abused by users who don't understand that you can't magically retrieve the document they accidentally closed without saving.

Foodforthought,3d51oa,AnnaLemma,34,Tue Jul 14 16:34:15 2015 UTC,"I really like this article. I think it gets to the root of why we can't have an honest dialogue about race in America... Because white people and black people are not taking about the same things. White people are talking about how they don't ""feel"" that they are racist, where as black people are talking about an ever pervasive culture of discrimination that they experience daily. Because we don't experience the daily discrimination, but live in the same county/ culture many white people have a hard time believing that   Also, I really liked the point about not wanting to offend white people- we can't talk about it because we don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. Well that's messed up. Maybe if more white white folks knew what racial discrimination looks and feels like they would have their eyes opened. This issue is too important to worry about offending individuals who have no idea what is really going on!  I don't know why it's so hard for ""us"" aka white people to have emphathy for our fellow human beings.   If you're white you need to recognize you don't know what it's like not to be white- just because you don't see discrimination doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Is like that South Park episode where Stan tells Token he doesn't know what it's like to be called ""the n-word""; we don't know what it's like to be black in America and saying you ""understand"" is rarely helpful, true, or said with actual understanding.   I have no idea what it's like to be a non white individual in America- but at least there are people trying to educate us. At least there are individuals and organizations fighting to change things.  If we are willing to confront ""unpleasant"" aspects of America, our institutions, and ourselves perhaps we can live up to the ideals we claim are the foundation of America. When you are part of the discrimination passively it's hard to admit that you now need to actively recognize and change discrimination within yourself and society.   Edit: subject/ verb agreement"
Foodforthought,3d51oa,epickneecap,3,Mon Jul 13 20:30:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but also because the field is somewhat mined.  Accusations of racism, sexism, and homophobia have ruined people.  Lost jobs, social shunning, ended political careers.  As such it's a bit hard to get to the psychological nudity needed to really have any of these conversations.  If you're afraid of losing your job if you fuck up in a race conversation, it's easier to just not have it.    The definition is also different, but I think it's because of the stakes involved.  You don't want to be seen as racist.  Look at the things whites define as racist -- words and overt acts.  Nobody cares if you think racist thoughts, just keep it to yourself.  But that's a self protection definition, something like saying that so long as you aren't actively robbing a house, serving as driver or lookout doesn't matter.  After all, you didn't break the lock personally, you didn't steal that watch personally, you helped the person who did."

We can find common ground in traits and mov eon.  That's all that can be done.  Discrimination, or stereotyping, happens to all people in some way or another.  Even among white people.

That's basically the definition of empathy: to acknowledge someone's struggles from a position of ignorance. It's probably the most appropriate use-case for ""I literally can't even"". Compare that to sympathy, when you actually have been in the other person's shoes.   With that in mind, it doesn't seem very helpful to express sympathy to someone if you don't actually share the experience. I think the problem is that it comes off as dismissive. ""It must suck being black. I know how it is, because it sucks being white, too."" Trying to compare suffering is usually counter-productive."

Because we don't experience the daily discrimination, but live in the same county/ culture many white people have a hard time believing that    Any time you're explaining one side's point of view with several multisyllabic words and explaining the other's with a few very short words, one in quotation marks, it should occur to you that you may be misunderstanding and unfairly representing part of someone's argument.  The issue here isn't just that some white people (see how I'm not being racist here?) don't recognize the existence of systemic and institutional racism. This is part of the issue, but the other part of the issue is that some people, black, white, whatever, see race as a fundamentally identifying feature whereas others do not.  Let's unpack that for a second and look at the consequences. What happens when we view races as cohesive groups that are culpable for one another's actions? Well, now if someone does something wrong that person's actions are reflected on their entire race.   When's the last time you looked at the crime rate in the United States? Following this logic that we've got here above, in which people are responsible for the actions of their race, it would seem that black people have a disproportionate amount of crime to answer for. Now we'd pretty much all agree that holding all black people responsible for the statistical prevalence of black males among those engaging in criminal behavior (or at least getting caught) is racist. Yes? I certainly think it's a terribly racist thing to do.   I don't think we ought to assume that people have anything to do with other people of their own skin color. Why not? Well, because I don't seem to have any sort of magical influence over powerful white people. In fact, the president who, to date, has done the most I've agreed with is a black man.   So we can see here that this idea of people answering for their race is totally nonsensical and that when we apply it to black people we can immediately see it as racist.   What, then, is the problem with emphasizing individual identification over identification with race? Why shouldn't I take exception to being lumped in with my demographic information?  If you were to make assumptions about me based on my sexuality you'd see how that's pretty readily offensive, right? So then why not race?"
Foodforthought,3d51oa,aidrocsid,14,Tue Jul 14 08:32:23 2015 UTC,"I think one of the things that readers of this piece should keep in mind is that it is was written to be delivered orally. The sermon format cannot at the same time be effective rhetoric and include the type of nuance of an academic discussion of race.   That said, one of the things that has me conflicted is the constant use of terms black and white as monolithic groups. It can't be denied that the use of these terms is necessary to describe current US racial relations. But I can't help but feel that if the only way we can discuss race relations is in the language of us vs. them, then we are feeding the demon that got us here in the first place."
Foodforthought,3d51oa,adavey29,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:38:57 2015 UTC,"The interesting notion about what you're saying, posits that we shouldn't be feeding the discussion.  If I understand the claim correctly, you're saying that talking about the division of races contributes to that very division.  e.g. If I talk about how my race is mistreating another race, we must talk about that other race and how to are constantly mistreating that other race.  If this has any truth to it, it's in fact an argument against talking about that division at all, right?  I mean if we interacted with each other as if there was no racial divide, then wouldn't that accomplish exactly what we hope to accomplish?"
Foodforthought,3d51oa,fpssledge,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:34:40 2015 UTC,"It's more to do with the fact that the terms black and white have little to do with cultural roots or place of origin. German, Irish, Russian, French, and Italian are all White, while Carribean, South African, African American, and Somalian are all just Black. If we are completely colorblind, then we lose sight of the important cultures and traditions that comes with a racial or ethnic identity, diminishing them. Speaking of Black and White as a monolith does something similar. I think this is dangerous when cultural curiosity, the sharing food customs and traditions across ethnicities is one of the strongest tools for expanding empathy."
Foodforthought,3d51oa,adavey29,47,Tue Jul 14 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that racism is still alive. I believe that it still is a problem. I acknowledge that blacks are both misrepresented and underrepresented in media. I believe that it's true that many white people deny the existence of racism, while many perpetuate it through their behavior. And even though I acknowledge its existence, I don't, however believe that this is my fault or my responsibility as a white person to make this better, any more so than a black person's, or better yet, any more so than a human's. I know that sounds harsh. I know it sounds like I don't care. But I do care.  Metta states, ""And White people, every single one of you, are complicit in this racism because you directly benefit from it."" So, I am guilty of being a racist because I benefit from living in a society that has put the white man on the pedestal for the entirety of its existence? I am racist because I was born a white person and raised in a society where I received benefits simply because I am white? Those things make me a racist? I don't deny that my life is easier than others because of my race. I also believe that my life has been harder for other reasons that are beyond my control, like my gender or social status. Does that make me a victim of sexism? Does that make me a victim of social discrimination? I don't know. What I do know is that those things pale in comparison to my supposed involvement and perpetuation of racism simply because I was born white.  He also states, ""White people have the privilege to interact with the social and political structures of our society as individuals."" Is that really a privilege or is it a choice? Could I not also choose to think of myself in terms of a group, like blacks are supposedly forced to? Could blacks not think in terms of an individual the way I am privileged to? I actually don't know the answer to that. What bothers me about that statement is that I, a white person, am told how I live, who I am, and how I choose to identify myself based on the perceptions of a black person. Is he wrong? Is that a fair statement to make? I also don't know the answers to those questions. I think I can say with certainty that those statements, are by definition, racist. In fact, Metta makes many racist statements throughout his article saying ""They have no desire to think in terms of a group"" or ""White people...reject the existence of racism"" or ""White people are good as a whole, and only act badly as individuals"" or ""Would you be so quick to help then [a person in need of help], or would you, like most White people, stay silent and let it happen."" He then goes on to say that when a black person is told (by a white person) that when they (a black person) brings up the issue of racism that they are ""told we are being racist"" and then goes on to ask ""Does any intelligent person actually believe a systematically oppressed demographic has the ability to oppress those in power?"" As both a white person and an intelligent one, I say yes. More so, the systematically oppressed has the power to be racist, the very thing Metta is fighting. I find that extremely interesting because Metta himself makes several racist comments throughout his article and then has the gall to act as though he is not only not racist, but couldn't be if he tried. And that right there is why I disagree with this article.  Racism is alive and prevalent in the United States. Racism hurts, damages, and misrepresents black people every single day. But it doesn't stop there. It hurts everyone. It hurts white people, black people, brown and blue people too. To say that, ""I will no longer be silent, but it's getting harder because...White people don't seem to care about the loss of so many Black lives"" is an ignorant and offensive statement. Your ability and willingness to defend a race isn't dependent on the feelings of anyone. And more importantly, Metta is perpetuating racism by putting whites into a group that wholly do not care for the lives of blacks.  So, yes, stand up. Speak out. Be a Good Samaritan and reach out to help someone even if it may jeopardize your comfort. Don't do it because it's a black and white issue. Do it because it's a human issue."

Even if I agree to the author's postulates, the question remains: what am I personally expected to do about it? Practically speaking, what can I, personally, do that would make the author say ""Okay, you're not racist""?  Do I need to quit my job (which I got in large part because I speak Russian)? Do I need to sell my not-very-expensive suburban townhouse in a decent school district and (try to) get an apartment in the projects? Do I need to drop everything and devote my life solely and entirely to the author's cause? I postulate that even all of that would not be enough, because there's still an implicit bias in my favor every time I set foot outside of my door.  I repeat: what can I personally, practically do to make the author satisfied? What can I personally, practically do to make myself, in his definition, not racist?  Practically, realistically, the answer is ""nothing."" There is nothing I can do because I cannot single-handedly change the culture in which I am embedded. I can practically try to weed out implicit biases, I can practically make hiring decisions based on ability and not race.  But I cannot practically change how all other people perceive me.

Never had alot of money in our family but we never went without a roof over our heads or food in the pantry. But somehow this fact is something I've done to perpetuate racism? I've been told that before. It makes no sense to me. I had no say so in being white or male. I haven't abused the dice roll nor abused any other person in my life. It blows my mind that some people get angry at someone for being a certain race or sex. Some feminists attacked my ""character"" one time by telling me these things, yet they didn't know a single thing about my true character. Their behavior was indeed sexist and they told me that it was impossible for a social minority to be sexist (eg women to men) or racist (eg blacks to whites). That just didn't make much sense. If you mistreat someone because of a demographic difference, no matter the camps involved, it is discrimination, hateful, and morally wrong.

I can't say every example or anecdote he uses is flawless but I think their is a crucial distinction between saying ""White people all benefit from systematic racism."" and ""All white people are racist because they benefit from systematic racism."" The distinction is the crux of his argument and the reason the discussion often times does go no where.   You ask if you are a racist because you benefit from this system, no, of course no! That's his entire point! You can benefit from a world where white people always star in ""The Bachelor"" with out being racist. Rational discussion is impossible with out everyone getting defensive because racism existing means racists must exist. I can benefit from our system, that doesn't make me racist.

You can't expect people to answer for the actions of others simply because they have the same skin color.   Are black people, socially, more likely to be seen as a group based on their skin color than white people? Yes. This how we know that society is racist against black people. The solution to this is not to also be racist against white people, but to stop being racist against black people.   Lumping people into cohesive units based on skin color does not eliminate racism, it exacerbates it. Whether or not we care about someone getting killed or worry that it might happen to ourselves or someone we love shouldn't hinge on the color of that person's skin.    . Or even worse, we’re told that we are being racist (Does any intelligent person actually believe a systematically oppressed demographic has the ability to oppress those in power?   Oh hey, it's the ""I can't be racist because I'm black"" card. Racism is judging someone based on their race. That's all it requires. Are you judging someone based on their race? Racist!

Example: In a Leave it to Beaver type childhood episode, I broke a car window with a rock that I threw at a tree.  My dad made me knock on the guy's door and explain what happened.

The fact that human males have higher mortality does not imply a selective pressure that would reduce it.  You can simply look at the vast majority of bees, wasps, and ants to see that a short lifespan in one sex of a species is not necessarily maladaptive.  Although, I may be misunderstanding you.

I didn't bother to read past the first couple of paragraphs, since I can assume this lack of critical thinking would be pervasive throughout.  Humans aren't cruel to animals out of pleasure or sport.  Farmers treat animals cruelly because of market conditions that require them to produce animal products in the cheapest way possible (within a limited set of hygienic restrictions).

Much like the TVA did during the great depression, this would put people back to work and help the country grow its economy.  I don't see it happening, though.

Chess has a winner and a loser; ""how you played"" the game is irrelevent and gets no trophies. It is also an individual activity; there are no team hugs after a well played game, no group cries after a loss.   Most women's games , such as women's soccer or volley ball, are gender separated, so that women who are at best second-level competitors play other second-level competitors and not the first-level men.  Let's consider not team sports but one-on-one sports.  Yes, I am aware that Serena Williams is a possible counter example. Until she competes against a top-seeded man, my point stands. Yes, I am aware of Billie Jean King. From Wikipedia:   In 1973, at age 29, she won the so-called Battle of the Sexes tennis match against the 55-year-old Bobby Riggs   Wow, the top-seeded woman's tennis player wins against a man who was at the top of his game twenty five years earlier.

Furthermore, not all sects of christianity agree on many things and there is no one denomination that has absolute ownership of the name christianity. Even worse, christianity is not the only religion in the world so we cannot make laws that favor one religion's beliefs, let alone one sect over another.  I know critics of gay marriage don' get this but the laws that allow gay citizens to have equal rights are the same laws that allow christians to worship freely. If they were very smart, they'd support gay marriage as the more they support the freedom to believe as you wish the more they help keep those freedoms themselves. Make a mechanism in the law that permits discrimination, and it can be used just as easily against you. Food for thought indeed."

You could make similar arguments about proponents of gay marriage; that they are convinced of their position on the certainly of their moral convictions.  They feel threatened by not being allowed to marry, just as those conservatives feel threatened when gay marriage is legalized.  They felt persecuted when their position was not upheld by the law, just as conservatives seem to be feeling now.  The solution he offers at the end, pluralism, which he describes as a ""third way"" between power and persecution seems to me to boil down to just being ok with people doing whatever they want?  Which is fine, with certain caveats such as you can't allow people to do whatever they want if what they want involves violence against others, or infringes on the personal property of others.  But society has always frowned upon certain behaviors, even if that list is shorter than it once was.  What about marrying multiple partners, for instance?  If it's ok for a woman to marry another woman, why is it not ok for a woman to marry two other women?  Or to marry a woman and a man?  Why put age restrictions on the age of marriage?  What about other social taboos, such as bestiality?  Cannibalism?  Many people find such practices offensive, but then many people once found homosexuality offensive.  Should ""what's ok"" be determined by a majority vote?  By congress?  By the supreme court?  Furthermore, very little of this is relevant if you are a strong believer in some literal version of The Bible, or at least your church's interpretation of whatever Bible translation they have chosen.  If you believe that your minister speaks some kind of divine truth, then it really doesn't matter what the majority of society has deemed to be OK, as it will always be ""against your religion"".  Imagine that the government ruled stealing was OK, but you had been taught by the church and your family for your entire life that stealing was wrong.  Would you be convinced when the Supreme Court upheld the ruling and confirmed that stealing was morally OK?  Probably not.  PS:  I want to make clear that I am actually in favor of gay marriage, but I sometimes feel like opposing viewpoints are not well represented on sites such as reddit, and I don't think this article is well argued."

What I find fascinating is that in both cases, both groups are not only, as you point out, convinced of their moral convictions, but they are the same moral convictions when you examine them closely. Both camps are in full agreement, they just don't realise it.  The freedom for gay people to have their marriages recognized by the state (which is what this is about, by the way. It's NOT about gays' right to marry. They have that. Have always had that. You can get married by any number of groups, churches and organizations. You just couldn't get it recognized by the government. THAT'S what this is about.) is the same freedom that christians enjoy, to have their right to believe recognized by the state. In both cases, it's about beliefs.  Firstly, it is unfair to say, ""christians believe homosexuality is a sin"" because not all denominations believe that. So we have to look at just those christians who believe it is. Here's a group within the US that wants its beliefs recognized by the state. They get tax breaks and tax exemptions, they get certain legal conveniences, and enjoy a protected status within our society. They also have the freedom to believe being gay is a sin and therefore preach it in their churches. They have the freedom of speech, like any citizen, to preach it in the streets if they so choose.  The problem arises when they work to codify discrimination into the secular law based on their subjective beliefs. Gays and straight people / christians who support gay marriage recognition believe it is not a sin. We cannot have state law determining whose belief is right. We have state law that affords everyone the right to believe as they choose.  Here's the real problem, and it's because conservative christians are unaware that they pose the bigger threat. Once you codify into the law a way to discriminate against someone for their beliefs, it can be used on you too. Both sides want the freedom to believe and live as they choose, make the life for themselves they choose to in America. That's ""the American dream."" So it doesn't make good sense to watch christians fight so hard to persecute someone for their beliefs."

Proponents of gay marriage aim to help people,  To say that supporters of gay marriage are behaving the same way as opponents makes me laugh but then cry a little to imagine how many people might actually see it that way. Like they are actually ""right"" in some way for bringing their religion into a non-religious argument that greatly affects the lives of those around us. If I was religious, I'd still support gay marriage. Government isn't a place for me to exercise power over others. Who gives a shit if I think gay marriage is wrong or if my Bible says shit about it. When I get my ballot, I don't think ""Finally, my chance to exercise my completely unrelated personal beliefs on others that are not part of them"". Many people do, they have a skewed idea of what voting is. It's for the people, not for you. Do not save them from fears they do not have.  You're just falling down the slippery slop fallacy further and further. but I do agree: Why cant people get married to multiple partners? I've wondered. I always joked that I'd begin arguing in favor of polygamy when gay marriage was legalized, I guess its time. There should be no problem with it. That said, marriage age, cannibalism, bestiality are entirely different and mostly unrelated. Different court cases entirely, nothing to do with gay marriage. Weak, weak argument.   Should ""what's ok"" be determined by a majority vote? By congress? By the supreme court?   Of course, that's why we are supposed to have a democracy. I'd go against Socrates and say the opinion of the many is what matters here. I don't give a fuck what a couple old guys think, the opinion of the people is what matters.  It always made me laugh that people choose gay marriage as the law where they'll actually start living by the bible. There are a million little rules and caveats that will get you in trouble / put in Hell, but the only one most religious folk care about is the one that they can easily exercise over others but won't suffer from themselves. Its really that obvious. No one is getting into Heaven with the rules set. Stop trying to limit others because of your own, completely personal beliefs.

Which is why revealed religions are most entrenched in rural, small-town, hyper-homogenous areas.  And which is largely why there's far less narrowmindedness (and therefore far less regard for exclusivist Christian doctrine) among those who have left home to obtain their education (the farther away, the better), and who travel on their vacations, and who later think nothing of moving across country for a good job.

If this happens (and Adam Gopnik claims that it already has) then some Christians will be forced to, for example, bake cakes for gay weddings or be driven out of business.

Foodforthought,3d0a06,spaceprinces415,-6,Mon Jul 13 12:30:52 2015 UTC,"Really? The only arguments against I've ever heard people discuss are non-religious. I guess in my circles people are less religious than in yours. Here are the better ones:   This institution exists in every major culture for most of history. There's obviously a reason for it to exist. Don't break it any more than we have done unless you know how to fill the gap. Kids do better when raised by one father and one mother at least (more is better, but that seems to be a minimum). If you turn an institution from one that is fundamentally-for-parenting-with-some-edge-cases, into one that is fundamentally-about-something-else-god-knows-what-though it's very very likely you'll break it.    I don't endorse these arguments ... much. But they're not trivial to dismiss."
Foodforthought,3d0a06,someoddballguy,3,Sun Jul 12 21:50:14 2015 UTC,"Yes ""reasons"" exists for why many cultures were against gays but that in itself doesn't make them good/relevant. Something being traditional isn't a reason to do it (in the words of Lemony Snicket, sorry). That second point about gay couples being worse parents isn't true. The largest study to date found no difference. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/635/abstract Considering prior research was very limited in this area it seems more reasonable to attribute that mindset to stigma. For the third point, I thought marriage was fundamentally about the sacred bond between two people, in which case I don't think allowing more people to participate does anything but make the institution stronger, especially during a time where you see more individuals disinclined to it. Parenting can be a part of being a family, but it isn't for plenty of people, and global procreation is no longer an issue. However, considering things like the study finding that ""children in same-sex parent families had higher scores on measures of general behavior, general health and family cohesion compared to population normative data"", and a surge in adopted orphans, even including the extraneous parenting factor in the equation doesn't seem to break anything at all."

Gay people are just people, even if you ""picked a side"" without anything to draw from, why wouldn't you think them just as capable parents as any other person, especially if those 2 dudes or 2 women would have been 2 fathers and 2 mothers with people not for them under a different set of ""laws"" (if they chose to adhere).

Marriage has never been considered merely the best kind of friendship, or else why do we have weird rules about marrying siblings   I mean, why is it a problem unless you plan to have kids which is a biologically terrible idea. Even if that statement were objectively true...okay. Gay couples can adopt, and are. It's important children that exist are healthy and getting attention too. Not everyone who reproduces should, but especially considering adoption/artificial insemination/surrogate process, leaving a baby in a dumpster is way less likely for a gay couple. For the statement itself, the best friendship is exactly what many people consider marriage, especially now, a time when worrying about passing our genomes along is no longer relevant for the human race, many people don't want kids, and overpopulation is the future concern. Many think the idea is stupid but do it for the tax benefits.

Hey, maybe it's even a slippery slope to comprehensive mental healthcare, but after all this is Paul Ryan's suggestion so let's not get carried away.  There is nothing wrong with this kind of approach to poverty.  There is a lot wrong with not addressing the wider societal problems that cause it, which is what the author is trying to say, but as part of a comprehensive solution, these individual programs can be helpful (in theory, anyway).  Not admitting this is denying reality, as much as not looking for societal solutions as well.  The exercises about bragging and doing positive things...  That's really great.  Jobless people can suffer from a deep inertia.  I've been there, and I would have been starving on the street if I didn't have support from my family and my (then-) girlfriend for basic food and rent.

There are thousands of people and thousands of job openings.  I found my most recent job after interviewing with several other companies first, all of whom rejected me.  But then one of them decided to hire me.  Also, this job opening didn't exist three months before I was hired -- so if I had tried three months earlier, I wouldn't have gotten it.  Stuff opens all the time; there's a lot of stuff around, too.  And if the number of available workers is greater than the number of available job openings, you don't have to have people who simply don't have jobs, period.  You can have people simply spending longer periods without employment but have employment the rest of the time.  For example, if there are 5 openings and 6 people, one possible scenario is that each person works only 10 months out of the year and they alternate months of unemployment.  Obviously this kind of thing wouldn't happen this way in real life, but it illustrates the principle.  You don't have to be the best applicant for every job.  You just have to be the best available applicant for one job, and that's the one you take.  And to become that best available applicant, you have to improve yourself and work hard.  This will still leave plenty of people in the dust, and that's not OK.  Some people are trained, but for jobs that no longer exist.  Some places just really have a shitty ratio, and that can only be fixed by somehow increasing demand.  Some people have other factors that make them unattractive candidates for a job that they can't do anything about at this point.

McDonald's is not the only employer.  Those million applicants are also applying to plenty of other jobs.  And, when it comes to low-skill jobs like fast food service, a little bit of self-improvement and career education can actually go a long way to put you ahead of the competition.  I also don't think you're appreciating just how low-skilled these people can be.  I graduated from a top American university, and even I couldn't find a job for a long time because I was missing the skills appropriate for the jobs I was looking for.  After working with a life coach and making various changes -- and using those changes to actually acquire new skills -- I'm now quite employable (at a junior level, but that's still better than unemployment).  But five years ago I 100% wasn't.  I had no idea what I was doing.  I was hoping people would see my degree and want to hire me, which of course is bullshit but who was going to tell me that?  Unemployment figures are actually fairly low.  We hear a lot about the unemployed, but really that's only 10% or so (depending on how you measure it, but this is a ball-park estimate anyway).  To get a job (any job, not necessarily one you want), you don't need to be in the top 5%.  You need to be in the top 90%.

No wonder conservatives hate universities the facts seem to have a liberal bias. but really it is just that they speak from a very narrow perspective, blinded by their lack of knowledge and political perspectives that make the facts in these cases inconvenient. Just like the people that take a picture of a disabled person adapting to what they have in life and tell people that don't have disabilities that they should see a lesson in ""hard work, responsibility, and self-improvement"" from them.

It is the fault of rich people and capitalism. The only solution is to eliminate inequality through socialism.  I have a degree in history, and have studied sociology and economics, as well as political science. The real truth is the capitalism of the United States has driven unprecedented positive change in the world, and saved it from the brink of socialist totalitarianism twice in the last century.  Capitalism has flaws, but no other economic system is demonstrably better.  Try making a list comparing the scientific and technological achievements from socialist countries against those of the United States of the last century. Or better yet, explain how the deaths of over 150 million people under socialist and communist regimes compares to the sorrow of having to look at a picture that makes you feel bad because you can't help your circumstances."

Foodforthought,3cosl6,TryUsingScience,14,Thu Jul 9 23:42:19 2015 UTC,"Did you read the article?   Yes.

Foodforthought,3cosl6,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-1,Fri Jul 10 04:30:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's really what the article says (I read it, but if you somehow managed to find that in the article I'd like to see where you got that from).   It says they shut down to figure out what to do, but it doesn't say that they hadn't at some point decided to keep their subreddit private with the rest of the subreddits even if they would have figured out how to proceed. In all likelihood, they would have kept the subreddit down in protest, it's just the most logically consistent possibility. They were probably affected the most by the recent firing of Victoria, and many other popular subreddits shut down in protest, one of which karmanaut (head mod on r/IamA) is a moderator on (AskReddit). Another shared moderator between the subreddits being /u/brownboy13 and both the two I just mentioned were vocal critics. So basically, the fact that AskReddit shut down in protest is pretty much confirmation to me that /r/IamA was also shut down in protest. I'm sure there are more shared moderators than that even, I just wanted to provide an example.  From what I could tell, /r/IamA came up a bit later than the rest, I believe /r/Science might have come back online earlier than many others, as I recall seeing their sticky post about it and then checking for other subreddits and some were still closed.  I believe the mods would rather not hurt reddit though, which is why they brought the subreddits back up so quickly after /u/kn0thing basically pleaded for them to. I'm not really trying to go all /r/conspiracy about it but the mods likely don't want reddit to die because even if another site rises in it's place, they likely won't be mods there, and clearly there must be some allure to being a mod otherwise they wouldn't be mods.  Edit: Just to provide what I would consider confirmation of what I said about AskReddit being shut down in protest basically proving that IamA was also shut down in protest, 12/20 of the moderators on /r/IamA are also moderators on /r/AskReddit after excluding the accounts that are either bots/shared accounts by the mod team and excluding non-contributing accounts (either brand new accounts or old accounts with basically no comments or submissions). AskReddit has more moderators that are not mods on IamA but those 12 from IamA, many of them have seniority on both subreddits."

Foodforthought,3cosl6,xiefeilaga,2,Fri Jul 10 04:46:45 2015 UTC,"I really don't think it matters. The admins would have taken over the subs and reopened them. I've said this before, but advertising space on reddit is sold by subreddit and date. Meaning you pick the sub where you want the ads shown, and the date when you want them shown. Popular subs like /r/iama are usually booked months in advance.  While the subs are private the people who booked ads for those dates were getting screwed, and the admins knew it. Despite the admins protest to the mods about ""the poor user experience"" they were undoubtedly more concerned about the ads already booked in those subs, and probably had to spent a week unfucking that mess and refunding everyone's money.  So I doubt the admins would have allowed the subs to remain private for much longer. Had the mods refused to go public the admins most likely would have given them the boot and reopened the subs. They really wouldn't have a choice. Reddit already collected the money for the ad spots."

Foodforthought,3cosl6,promethiac,21,Fri Jul 10 00:45:06 2015 UTC,"Wow they're so self-aggrandizing.   The issue goes beyond Reddit. We are concerned with what a move like this means for for-profit companies that depend on the free labor of volunteers — and whether they truly understand what makes an online community vibrant.  The secondary purpose of shutting down was to communicate to the relatively tone-deaf company leaders that the pattern of removing tools and failing to improve available tools to the community at large, not merely the moderators, was an affront to the people who use the site.   I realize I'm in the minnority here but I really don't feel bad for the mods at all. If Reddit wants to make changes in how they handle subreddits they don't need to ask the mods or the community first. They should have probably told them afterwards, but it's not like they could do so before they fired her. And they probably should have had a plan as well, unless they just wanted the mods to handle everything, in which case they should have told the mods that that is the new plan going forward.  I understand that the mods do a lot of good work for the site, but it would simply not be difficult to find additional mods if needed to ease the workflow. Not with a community of this size. Nobody twisted their arm to be mods of a major subreddit, they volunteered. I honestly don't feel bad for them at all.   When the company removed her without warning or providing alternative resources, it effectively hindered every community that hosts the wildly popular A.M.A.s that have made Reddit a part of the mainstream media conversation.   As I said I think this is a very valid complaint. However I think that's the only valid complaint that I've seen so far about her firing. The mods demanding notice beforehand, or reasoning, or even consultations is just not realistic at all. Not to mention that explaining why she was fired publicly violates her privacy as well, and could hinder her from getting other jobs."

If any of these things had happened we wouldn't be having this discussion right now. Put yourself in the administrators place. You are aware that one of your employees is going to be let go today and she is in charge of coordinating events with high profile users of your website, including events that are happening the same day you are letting her go. Wouldn't the very first thing you do, before you get any paperwork out or fire anybody, is to ensure there is continuity of process in her absence? A simple message ""Hey, there is a change in process. Here is the new contact information for AMAs"" is all it would have taken. You can fire her, and have the message sent at the same time. Dead simple. Her job was not rocket science. This entire thing could have been avoided by a single person over at reddit HQ going ""Huh, I wonder how AMAs will happen today now that Victoria has been abruptly let go.""  I don't think the mods of AMA are trying to say they should be consulted for personnel changes. I think what they are saying is this was a majorly stupid thing to do, and speaks to the complete ignorance the reddit administrators have about what actually gives their website value. You already have an incredibly successful platform with high profile celebrity guests appearing for free. Your ONLY job is to provide a smooth experience for them and the users.

On the one hand you have the Corporate is a Separate and Higher Entity View where everything corporate does for their own distant reasons, and on the other hand you have the Corporate and the User Base Should Be Much more Integrated View where the mods are seen as equals to the paid employees, or at least are treated as something more than just users of corporate's program, and want rights to go along with that status."

You dont have to have sympathy for them, I dont think they want it, they are reminding reddit it is their sub. They didnt just volunteer they actually created it and are free to do with it as they please. They are communicating to reddit that the business relies on them and they better listen."

Not sure what that is about.  It's interesting that there was the well respected guy on Quora who claimed to have acquired knowledge from someone inside reddit that Victoria was fired over the direction the new AMA stuff was going, and Pao flatout denied it and said this wasn't true. Now this article comes out which confirms one part of it, in which they clearly want to go in a different direction with AMAs. Whether or not that is why Victoria was fired remains to be seen, but it bolsters the claim.  They claim cleaning up the fatpeoplehate subreddit among others was about harassment and part of the explanations floating around was that they were harassing imgur staff (which seemingly was the best we could get because the admins refused to be straightforward about the whole issue), but this article sets up nicely why they are looking to get rid of subreddits like that, and they openly admit that they're going to do it some more.   We will do anything to preserve the ecosystem, and that type of [content] is a threat to the ecosystem.  He describes the policies, more of which are likely in the future, as “scalpels” intended to excise only the worst behavior without impinging on the site’s commitment to free speech. “At some 170 million people, we’re really talking about tens of thousands doing bad.”   So as long as they can find ways to divide the user base into sections of tens of thousands of people, then apparently they have no problem silencing them. It's just a small percentage of users. So they're just going to continue looking for angles in which they can claim it only affects a small portion of users.  I think one of the worst parts is this.   Most of that is traditional ads, but Pao and her new head of sales, Zubair Jandali, are increasingly trying to get advertisers—Nissan and Marriott, among others—to use the site the way Redditors do, hosting conversations related to a particular topic.   That's just fucking absurd. Seriously, get the fuck out of here with that. Everyone already knows advertisers game the site like that anyhow, but it's mostly chalked up to the fact that it's done under disguise. For the reddit administration to openly endorse it, that's just revolting.  Say what you want about Yishan, but he actually cared about the users on this site. This is just a massive sellout. /u/ekjp and /u/kn0thing have repeatedly denied that they were cleaning up the site to sell to investors, and I guess part of that is true. They aren't selling it to investors, they're selling it to advertisers. They won't openly admit it in any of their comments though because they know they would get thrashed by the users and they're still trying to control the last mess they created."

Now, I have never studied this, but it's not like our collective knowledge will all be lost.  Couldn't we at least maintain a pre-industrial revolution or industrial revolution style of living?  Or are we so far removed from that style of living that we couldn't hold on to a pre-industrial level of living as an agrarian society due to further specialization?  EDIT:  Obviously, it's all predictions and speculation, but I'm sure some knowledgeable people have studied and run predictions on this."
Foodforthought,3clebx,TalkingBackAgain,4,Thu Jul 9 05:07:15 2015 UTC,"but it's not like our collective knowledge will all be lost   Today we require enormous amounts of technology to keep us going, but we don't know that, we are removed from nature, we are even removed from our technology. How many of the industriously SMS'ing smart phone users do you know could comfortably configure a router, as a % of users?   You need a power grid. You need maintenance of your infrastructure. You need medical care, cq: medication, cq: medical equipment. You need tools [there are going to be a great many tools available. Tools should not be an issue]. You need soap. Hygiene becomes a big problem really fast. Infections are a manageable circumstance now, in the pre-medical age they're a death sentence. It happens really fast and it's very ugly. You need knowledge to know all that, cq.: you need the means to pass that knowledge on to the next generation. You need food, cq.: you need the means to grow food, and that was one of the big ones that is going to be affected first.   All these systems will have pockets where people by and large have some level of technical skill and the know-how to pass it on. Then you will have a very large amount of people who will have to do real work for a change. Like: actual work that is going to keep their body alive.  They did an experiment once. They built a small neolithic tribe where they had a number of people who were going to provide for themselves. You can't just take people out of their houses and chuck them into a tent. So they gave them 4 days' worth of supplies. They put someone in charge who was going to 'lead' the people. They did some sort of 'back to nature' spiel. What these people did not understand was that they were now in a dire survival situation. It's sink or swim. Everybody, -everybody- needs to chip in to get the bare bottom basics of existence going and to make sure there is fresh water, there is shelter, there is fire and there is food. And that not 'some times', all the time. Every day.  They lasted 4 days. Not coincidentally the amount of days they had food for. Then it went downhill in frightening haste. These people had no concept of their situation and how much hard, tedious slog work was required to just keep the show running.  So, we're going to do better, for a while. There is lots and lots and lots of stuff about, we're going to be good for a good long while. Longer if we understand that we're now in a bad shape and we have to manage what we have really carefully. If at long last it dawns on us that 'we're all in this together and we need -all- hands to help pull us through', maybe we have a shot. I'm not even remotely confident that even then we'd stick it out together. Way too many entitled people around. Most of them need to be dead first before you can carry on.  After the initial period wears out and we're running out of gear / food / supplies, that's when the Lord of the Flies holds court. Then it gets to be really ugly.  I have no hope for our species at this point. We're an also ran. We're the reason for the Fermi paradox. ""Where are they?"" They're licking their wounds and leaving all sorts of interesting artefacts behind for 'them' to find. But we're done. A species with a 90-day horizon does not deserve to survive."

There are negative affects that change the ability of some currently populated areas to carry their current population. That's not minimizing the effect. That's the effect. And it IS fucking serious. Very.   But, half of the problem is the ""We're going to make the entire planet uninhabitable to humans really soon!"" argument.   The worst case scenarios are REALLY bad, but are also not the most likely scenario.   If we lose the world's fisheries, we have a big, big problem. And that's possible.

ENTIRELY because of politics. We throw away more than a third of the food produced in the world.   But with some of the more dire predictions of climate change models, we could become unable to produce enough food. Ocean acidification, droughts, desertification, floods, etc.  Disease will be another product of climate change as warm weather exposes more people to more vectors."
Foodforthought,3clebx,Mybackwardswalk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:43:27 2015 UTC,Hypothetically climate change could also cause an increase in world population. The UN population forecasts are projecting that the population will stabilise at 10-12 billion by 2100 due to increased wealth and subsequent reduction in fertility levels. But with the dire effects of climate change it's reasonable to think that a lot of developing countries won't be able to climb out of poverty and their fertility levels will remain constant or increase leading to the world population increasing.
Foodforthought,3clebx,Ginsbergs-girlfriend,8,Thu Jul 9 02:47:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, but mostly those who are already at risk (young children, the elderly, people living in extreme poverty, those with pre-existing conditions like severe asthma). We are already seeing millions of deaths in the Indian subcontinent from more-extreme-than-expected heat waves. There are already thousands of climate refugees. Bigger and badder storms and killed and displaced people worldwide. These trends will continue, by all forecasted accounts. But like I said: we can do things to make it better! It's never too late (it just gets worse the longer we wait)."
Foodforthought,3clebx,jstevewhite,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"Unless we have a major technological breakthrough, there's no real model where we can make it better, only where we can limit the damage. To 'make it better' we would have to start taking more carbon out of the atmosphere than we generate - not just carbon zero, but a negative carbon production."
Foodforthought,3clebx,idarterto,4,Thu Jul 9 02:18:40 2015 UTC,"Yes it will.   The simplest way in which climate change will kill people is by increasing the frequency of extreme weather events. Scientists can make a model that simulates the weather in some region. If they then run this model with varying degrees of climate change, and doing that that very often they can count how many storms etc happen in a scenario with a lot a little or no climate change. When they compare the results from all of these simulations, that gives statistical data that can be used to express the likelihood of certain bad things happening in the model with varying degrees of climate change. Those simulations indicate that it is very likely that more extreme weather events will occur due to climate change. People do tend to get killed in things like storms and tornados, if there are more of these events, more people will die.  Another relatively simple way in which climate change will kill people is by melting glaciers and permafrost. The melting will make the foundations of buildings and roads that were build on permafrost, unstable. The increased instability makes it more likely that one will collapse, and with more collapses more people will die. In the same vein, slopes that are stable now because of the ice that is currently present in and on the ground, will not be so once that ice melts. That means more landslides and the like will occur, and those tend to kill people too when they happen.  There are other avenues of death as well, but those are more abstract. For example if we are going to have to invest large amounts of capital and labor into mitigating the consequences of climate change, that means we are not going to spend those resources on other things that might have saved lives, like making the roads safer, or curing childhood cancer. This might very well be the biggest factor for rich societies.  Finally your dismissal of starvation is not entirely fair. By ways similar to those used to estimate changes in the likelihood of extreme weather events, we can also estimate how likely it is that the weather conditions will occur that are associated with bad harvests. If those become more frequent, especially in areas that seem starvation prone today, you could probably make a good case for climate related deaths due to starvation. Since most of the time there is enough food to feed everyone on Earth, that means that a lack of ability or political will to prevent famines, allows starvation to occur when it does. Those two factors might be so important that they override any climate driven change in the number of people who starve, but I don't know anywhere near enough to say that for sure.  I am not so sure about the population decline due to climate change. In most of the countries that face a population decline, that seems to be happening because women choose to have fewer kids. A big factor in that preference seems to be how many economic options a woman has and how well educated she is. Is climate change likely to impede economic improvement in such a way that more women will choose to have many children? Or will it cause such economic hardship that people will be unable to afford having children at all, thereby making it less likely the average women will choose to have an extra child? I wonder what it will be."
Foodforthought,3clebx,jstevewhite,3,Thu Jul 9 02:48:12 2015 UTC,"Starvation today occurs due to politics, and entirely due to politics. If the amount of arable land should shrink enough, it will no longer be politics."

There are some predictions for global warming that could see all life on the planet die, or at least most of it.  Basic biological systems that support all life on Earth have the potential to break down.  Humans would have a very hard time surviving such changes even with our technology as we have always depended on them.   A response capable of saving our species would need to be organized, global and require tremendous amounts of sacrifice.   There is also an issue of how society would react to such rapid deflation.  Do you really think losing over 80% of the population would result in a direct downscale of our economy with nothing changing?  That's absurd.  Our economic systems would collapse as they are based on economies of scale.

When life dies it releases carbon.  When carbon enters the atmosphere it dissolves into the ocean gradually increasing its acidity.   When the ocean reaches a certain level of acidity it can't support life.  When most of the life in the ocean dies the primary system that converts CO2 to O2 ends.     Just because certain areas of the Earth will remain at acceptable temperatures really means nothing.  It's not the heat that will kill, it's the biological systems that will collapse.   We are looking at a global extinction event that hasn't occurred in several hundred million years."

Personally I tend to agree with you about the level of caution and timidity used in official and scientific reports on the issue - we should be more blunt about the potentially catastrophic consequences. But look here in this thread - we have people criticising those in the article for using descriptors associated with the worst case scenarios. And that's one way it could go; if a large body of scientists came out tomorrow and said 'we are pretty fucked' you'd have a massive section of society and powerful interests who would be more focused on the language and potential for hyperbole used than they would be at addressing the actual core message.   There is a ton of research that suggests that statements by experts and clear evidence aren't effective at changing people's minds. The research about the most effective way to change peoples minds is only in its infancy. Would doomsday scenarios and potential hyperbole work?

By and large, they are usually religious, and like Cox, see the death penalty as retribution rather than a disincentive.   But, right there in their own rulebook, it says very clearly: thou shall not kill.  Of course, the old testament is full of people killing each other with God's OK, or, you know, God nuking an entire town from orbit, so I guess there is some room for interpretation there.  However, then there are the beatitudes:   Blessed are the merciful: for they will be shown mercy.  Blessed are the peacemakers: for they will be called children of God.    The bible is a long book, though, and I suppose I'm as guilty as they are of pulling out the bits that serve my argument and ignoring the bits that work against it.

I don't think they're going to be making that argument.  Wikipedia has a good article on the commandment and refers to how the Hebrew texts (Torah and Old Testament) are A-OK with death as a punishment, and how the New Testament doesn't specifically refute those ""gotchas.""  They have a quote from the Catholic teachings on the subject (emphasis mine):   Assuming that the guilty party's identity and responsibility have been fully determined, the traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor.   I'm not sure how they are defining ""fully determined"" but I don't think it's ever possible to do that, and when you're using the death penalty you don't get a do-over for that.   The second part is more damning, I think. Lifetime in prison is just as effective at defending human lives. While there are very rare escapes of dangerous convicts, the vast vast majority of death row inmates are serving longer and longer sentences without any of them being a danger to the public. I think that pretty much invalidates the death penalty, in the US, at least from the Catholic Church's point of view.

There are individual, explicit changes to the rules, like the apparent abandonment of the dietary laws in Mark 7:19, but nothing unambiguously global.   There are even multiple accounts of disputes between early followers of Christianity- between apostles, even!- about in what respects and to what degree the old rules still apply.  As a consequence, views run the gamut of every possible opinion. None of the old covenant applies, all of the old covenant applies, the new covenant applies to gentiles only and the old one to Jews only, and lots and lots of variations on 'This part and this part and this part still apply, ignore the rest.'"

In fact, that is EXACTLY what he is doing, and it is called applied behavior analysis; that's what I just spent the last 4 year studying. ""Under Greene's philosophy, you'd no more punish a child for yelling out in class or jumping out of his seat repeatedly than you would if he bombed a spelling test. You'd talk with the kid to figure out the reasons for the outburst (was he worried he would forget what he wanted to say?), then brainstorm alternative strategies for the next time he felt that way."" This is essentially one of the main points and focuses of applied behavior analysis (ABA) -- to teach functional and appropriate alternative behaviors. I do this every day, and it's how I help get kids to stop hitting themselves, hitting others, purposely vomiting food, etc. Punishment is actually ok to do, but most people do it incorrectly, and it can have consequences, as mentioned in the article. So while I agree with the article, it also seems like it is a self promotion piece -- this guy is taking a 50 year old science (that has just recently started gaining popularity due to its efficacy) and slapping his own label on it. Additionally, with respect to punishment, in ABA (or what he calls skinnerism) we avoid punishment at all costs by using the least restrictive method possible first. Punishment is a last resort, and generally only used when all other alternatives fail AND the behavior is a danger to the person or others. He said that Skinner says to reinforce good behavior's and punish bad behaviors. I can probably count on my hand how many students I've had to use a punishment and I have tons of clients."
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,marquis_of_chaos,68,Tue Jul 7 12:56:09 2015 UTC,"I can barely finish reading this. It's too sad and touches too close to home. Something is deeply, deeply wrong with me and I believe living with a lot of childhood stress is a huge part of it.  I don't know how to make it happen but I believe that there are major changes that need to be made, starting in elementary school. Teachers and guidance counselors need better training in ""warning signs"". Not just with abuse or stress but with learning disorders and other psychological disturbances as well. Children don't have a frame of reference. They can't always come to an adult and say what is wrong because they don't realize it's wrong. I'm 26 and am just realizing how wrong some of the things that happened to me were. I was never physically hurt but like John in this article, I was constantly forced to be the adult between my parents when they were fighting. I grew up thinking my dad couldn't emotionally connect to me because he was a man and that's just how it was. I grew up thinking my mom had horrible PMS, not really seeing that her frequent outbursts and emotional manipulation were probably symptomatic of a larger problem.   I don't blame her because I think she grew up the same way. That's the cycle of abuse. You don't even know it's wrong because you lived it. You assume everyone is the same way. You justify all of your actions. Everyone is the hero to their own story.   We are failing our students and children in a MASSIVE way. There are tons and tons and tons of warning signs that no one talks about. Early intervention is probably the most important thing we can do for these kids and it almost never happens.  We have GOT to let go of all of the stigmas surrounding these issues/mental health/therapy/etc. ADHD isn't a made-up condition to medicate kids. It's a debilitating condition that makes life hell. Abuse isn't just the bruise it leaves, it's the life-long lasting effects that make so many people turn to drugs/alcohol/promiscuity. Imo, people vastly underestimate how much the formative and childhood years effect someone's life. And we, at least in the US, are blatantly ignoring all of this and then scratching our heads to figure out what's wrong with so many adults. We wonder why people are over-medicated. We are confused why so many people can't seem to handle adult life. We question how the incarceration rate got to be so high.   Stress isn't always due to disturbances at home. Children with learning disorders are very often looked over and thought to just be lazy or problem kids while they feel constant stress of not performing to their abilities. Students on the autism spectrum can feel constant stress that they ""aren't like other kids"". Girls are particularly susceptible to this. Their symptoms manifest in a very different way than boys and they often feel more stress to ""fit in"" or are simply better at hiding that they don't. I have been telling people my whole life that something is wrong but no one has ever listened to me or gotten me any help. Thinking about other people going through the same makes me sick.  And I haven't even discussed how race, economic status, death of a parent, sexuality, etc can all be just as stressful and cause a wealth of issues later on in life if not dealt with. It is not a surprise so many adults with personality/mental disorders or substance abuse have a history of a traumatic or stressful childhood.   This is really tl;dr but it's something I am passionate about. If I had a good direction to go in, I would run. We need to fix this. Giftedness and high IQ are very common in those with autism and learning disorders and can manifest into stress and anxiety easily. The students we are failing may be the most promising ones. All while we tend to congratulate others for showing psychopathic tendencies. There is something very wrong about all of this. I certainly won't claim to have all of the answers either but I KNOW the current status quo isn't working. Stressed children need advocates and mentors, not to be ignored and discarded because they're too much to deal with. I am begging the world to stop perpetuating that psychotherapy is unnecessary and mental health is unimportant. I truly think this is the key to fixing SO many problems. But I've never gotten anyone to listen to me before so I doubt it will start now."

I am an artist and have been investigating the philosophical, anecdotal, psychological and cultural reasons why people perpetuate trauma/traumatic behavior, as well as trying to understand ways in which we reverse or are resilient to it (the old good vs evil argument, if you boil it down). when I read this article on this subreddit I had tears in my eyes; it backed up a suspicion I'd had for some time. Congratulations on the book, all the best and THANKYOU."
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,betterneverlate,2,Thu Jul 9 15:07:01 2015 UTC,"betterneverlate, Thank you for saying this -- this is exactly why I research and write, hoping it will strike readers as the aha that will further healing. I so appreciate your taking the time to let me know this, means a lot."
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,donnajacksonnakazawa,2,Fri Jul 10 04:27:28 2015 UTC,"Hello- fellow artist here! I'm also interested in this subject, and thought I'd recommend a couple of websites in case you haven't come across them.   One is called, Out of the Fog, and provides information and support for understanding Personality Disorders. If you're not familiar with PDs, they're different types of extreme maladaptations of behaviors, which manifest in many different ways. Once you read about them, you start to see similar tactics utilized in politics, and other areas which rely on manipulation.  Another site is their companion site, Out of the Storm, which provides info and support regarding something called ""Chronic-PTSD,"" which is a result of some kind of ongoing trauma.   Both sites are extremely informative, have extensive definition lists, and shed a lot of light on the interplay of how these behaviors are perpetuated and passed on. There's a lot to draw from from an artists perspective. Best wishes with your work!"
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,JustMeRC,2,Fri Jul 10 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for the links. I'm aware of personality disorders but not the chronic PTSD . Do you incorporate psych into your work? If so I would be interested to see it, if you are comfortable to share?"
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,betterneverlate,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:27:43 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! Those are really the two best sites I've come across on the subjects, with lots of jumping off points to inspire an artist.  My art background comes from my training in Children's Theatre, making masks, costumes, props, and sets for performance purposes. So, it's not art in the same sense as that which is made to convey a particular idea or theme in a single piece, the way art one ""hangs on the wall"" is. My mask work is definitely an effort to capture traits in a way that magnifies them for a particular character. I work on a lot of ""warm and fuzzy"" stuff, though, since most of my work is for very young audiences.   I'm especially interested in the psychology of characterization for the purposes of acting. I've taught acting characterization through movement on the college level, which is my area of expertise, also known as the language of gesture. Mask and puppet work is a great venue for combining my love of human behavior, theatre, art, and music. I don't really put together comprehensive visual art pieces, but rather create visual/performance art ""scenes"" so to speak.  I've been thinking for a while about creating stand alone pieces which can be displayed, but haven't taken them from thought to creation yet. I'm still trying to figure out how to translate one medium to the other.   What's your medium, and themes/subjects you work with? I'd be happy to pm you a link to some of my work, but it's probably not that interesting in the context of this conversation."
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,JustMeRC,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:27:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your research and writing! What most of us who have had ACEs and have health problems want to know, is how do we get better? The net of ""therapy and meditation"" is a wide one which includes many different modalities. How does one know which avenue might work for them? Do you see evidence that any particular methods are more helpful for individuals with certain kinds of dysregulations, like chronic pain for example? Neuro-feedback is something that interests me, but is expensive and not covered by insurance. Is is worth taking a chance on something like this, because of a likelyhood of potential benefits? There are also many types of neuro-feedback. Any thoughts on which are beneficial, and which may be snake-oil?  Do you address these types of questions in your book at all, or is there just not enough study of it all to make recommendations yet?  Thanks again, and best wishes with the continuation of your important work!"
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,JustMeRC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:56:33 2015 UTC,Hi JustMeRC! Yes -- I talk about all the different ways in which early adversity leads to chronic adult health problems -- but also spend a third of the book delving into the science of healing. It's so important to me to not just talk about the problem but the science of solutions.  I think the book will help you decide about all these modalities including neurofeedback and EMDR and many others. Let me know what you think when you read? I'd love to see what you think is helpful for you?
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,donnajacksonnakazawa,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:51:33 2015 UTC,"I certainly will, thank you!  Consequently, since you're interested in having doctors treat the whole person, I thought you might be interested in this article, Can the Bacteria In Your Gut Explain Your Mood?, and the research that goes along with it. These researchers look at the connection between stress and the gut ecosystem and immune system. They really get into it about midway down.   I've done a decent amount of reading on different topics regarding chronic illness, stress/trauma, and the immune system. Your angle on ACEs and this other angle on the gut microbiome are the two most interesting ""ways in"" I've come across over the years. There is definitely a connecting thread between the two, which I think you might find interesting."

Foodforthought,3cf5qs,twoheadedratboy,3,Wed Jul 8 21:08:59 2015 UTC,"I heavily agree that counsellors and teachers need to be more informed of the signs of various mental illness.  I had anxiety problems from when I was probably six or seven onwards, from moving around a lot.  My family was poor and was constantly moving from school to school, a couple times a year.  Anyways, I had terrible social anxiety which developed into GAD and panic disorder.  Not a single teacher or counsellor managed to realize this and it wasn't until my 20's that I began to get help for it, but my life is fucked.  Failed college, failed every relationship, failed every good job chance.  Turn 30 in a few months and have almost nothing.  Am largely alive because I like playing games, and my little sister has MS.  Need to be there for her when my parents are gone."
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,Vellon221,11,Wed Jul 8 01:13:11 2015 UTC,"I had to log into my throwaway for this. First, I'm a male. I was sexually abused  by my father at a young age. Then throughout my adolescent and teenage years (before leaving for college) I got a healthy dose of abuse from my mother. She never believed the abuse, but that is a demon in it's own right. (check my post history for more details).  This story hit close to home, I don't think this give away too much but I'm in my mid 20s and I'm still dealing with it. This kind of damage re-writes your brain. It changes how you approach situations that normally come up. Things such as your first intimate encounter, going off to college, being by yourself, first job, etc. It wrecks your confidence. It also makes you more easily feel like a failure. ""Normal"" kid failing a test, meh it's a test. I fail a test, now I'm a failure. Even now when I know that isn't the case, my default state is to switch to that.  I am getting better at faking it until I make it, but you don't just get over this type of thing. I'll be around to answer questions if anyone has anything specific, but yeah. This article is on point.  Just as an aside, the phase ""be kind to everyone you meet"" applies. Everyone fights a battle every day. No matter how big or how small."

Foodforthought,3cf5qs,TWinthesky,19,Tue Jul 7 22:57:34 2015 UTC,"I first heard about the ACE from this presentation called ""Bomb in the Brain"" about six years ago. It's a very interesting 4-part series that I encourage everyone to watch.  What this article doesn't address strongly enough is emotional abuse and physical violence enacted against children, and the necessity of holding parents (and others) personally responsible for the damage that they do.  It has been shown that spanking is objectively harmful to children.  “In 2002, University of Texas at Austin professor Elizabeth Gershoff decided to look at several decades of past research. She surveyed 88 studies that included 117 tests of the hypothesis that spanking is associated with harmful side effects. Of those tests, 110 showed such effects. Straus calls the 94 percent agreement rate “an almost unprecedented degree of consistency” for scientific research.""  Here some other facts that those reading might find of use:   “Spanking erodes developmental growth in children and decreases a child’s IQ, a recent Canadian study shows. A real-time study found that, not only did the parents hit their small children (between 2-5 years old) nearly 1,000 times per year, oftentimes for trivial reasons, they often did it to discourage their children from hitting. Recent studies have found that up to 35% of babies were spanked in the last month. In a 1988 study of 14 juveniles condemned to death in the United States, 12 had been brutally abused as children, and 5 had been sodomized by relatives. This study by the NIH found that: “Being abused or neglected as a child increases the likelihood of arrest as a juvenile by 59 percent, as an adult by 28 percent, and for a violent crime by 30 percent according to one study that looked at more than 1,500 cases over time.” This article by Dr. Jack Pemmet in Psychology Today makes a connection between childhood abuse and psychopathy.   I found the book The Origin of War in Child Abuse to be a fascinating take on the long-term implications of traumatic childhoods.  Here's an excerpt:  “Today both Austria and Germany have laws making hitting a child as illegal as hitting an adult. Careful personality studies recently show both Germans and Austrians reporting less authoritarian attitudes than Americans.  Psychohistory’s main discovery is that war and genocide, like homicide and suicide, is a psychopathic disorder that simply does not occur in the absence of widespread early abuse and neglect, and I hope to show you that Austrian childrearing today has advanced sufficiently so that similar genocides and racist wars have become impossible for Austria in the future.  What has happened in the past half century to literally transform Vienna from a city described as having “a sheer magnitude of antisemitic violence greater than in any other city of the Reich” to a city of exceptional freedom, independence and tolerance? That the astounding change came only after childrearing vastly improved is obvious.”"

I have had constant diarrhea, and intestinal pains for years. I also dealt with substance dependency issues, was diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, depression, and such.  You know the only thing that has helped, and even reverse my problems that medications couldn't? Medicinal psychedelics. I've also been able to relieve the intestinal pains little by little by doing Ayahuasca ceremonies; I still have more memories to relive and process but things have gradually improved with my physical, emotional and mental health. I have also integrated yoga and meditation into my lifestyle.  Of course there are other possible routes out there like CBT, biofeedback, traditional therapy, and such too."
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,midoridrops,4,Tue Jul 7 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"I'm was already familiar with the idea from tangential research.    The question I have here, a really consuming one, is: Why?  Why would nature bring us here? Can it be true that childhood trauma--and understand there is research suggesting very strongly that the effect of important trauma at all is passed from generation to generation on the scale of grandparent to grandchild--is so damning to the future success of the subsequent offspring/lineage/family that evolution says: let's go ahead and cut our losses here.   That's such a miserable idea; it runs afoul of everything I (and many others) believe and desire."
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,Tezcatlipokemon,2,Tue Jul 7 20:33:53 2015 UTC,"It probably just happens.  Life is a complex system that breaks down in odd ways that start with patterns of degradation.  That said, there is evidence that abused children are a demographic that makes a unique contribution to society.  Individuals are damaged by this, but society is enriched by people who strain at the edges and express ideas and thought that most self censor without much thought or effort.  We need weirdos in order to extend our knowledge of the possible and of ourselves."
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,m0llusk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:13:49 2015 UTC,"I know it seems counterintuitive, but so much of our physical make-up is just built on the systems of our evolutionary ancestors. Just because parts of our brain have evolved to interact with the world in a much more complex way, our limbic system is still rather primitive. Fight or flight is about saving us right now. It doesn't plan for the future, because there is no future if you get eaten."
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,JustMeRC,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:31:58 2015 UTC,"is so damning to the future success of the subsequent offspring/lineage/family   Apparently not damning enough.   Why?   Sensitivity. We're sensitive in early life so that we can adapt to the environment. Though, it looks like there are limits on that. I mean we have social/psychological needs and if those go unmet then our health deteriorates (like with any other need).  Competitive life in nuclear families is a blip in our evolutionary history so that's why we're not used to it.   that the effect of important trauma at all is passed from generation to generation   What I consider important is that it's not passed through genes but simply because people lacking love (for themselves and from other people) have a hard time giving that love to others."
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,Bartek_Bialy,2,Wed Jul 8 03:38:19 2015 UTC,it's not passed through genes   Actually what I am referring to is studies that have found trauma is passed genetically... or epigenetically rather. Still it's a different kind of animal than what you are talking about.
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,Tezcatlipokemon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:45:57 2015 UTC,"I replied to your question before, but I came across this theory by Dr. Peter Levine, who describes the disconnect the following way:   Dr. Levine was inspired to study stress on the animal nervous system, when he realized that animals are constantly under threat of death, yet show no symptoms of trauma. What he has discovered was that trauma has to do with the third survival response to perceived life threat, which is freeze. When fight and flight are not options, we freeze and immobilize, like “playing dead.” This makes them less of a target. However, this reaction is time-sensitive, in other words, it needs to run its course, and the massive energy that was prepared for fight or flight gets discharged, through shakes and trembling. If the immobility phase doesn’t complete, then that charge stays trapped, and, from the body’s perspective, it is still under threat."
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,JustMeRC,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:51:07 2015 UTC,"Kind of you to take the time to come back and share!   I think it might help or be of interest if I gave some background on where I'm coming from with my thought on this. I'm a student of the gene-centric view of life and evolution. I hold that the fundamental unit of life is not the individual organism or a group, but the gene.  Well not even strictly the gene anymore, but gene inspired and dependent structures that take heritable information out into the indirect realm of the epigenetic. I'm inclined to believe that epigenetics feedback into genetics and are ""long bets"" that genes and teams of genes make toward long term overall increases in replication, ultimately maximizing their number of offspring, only maybe a few generations down the road. But I should say this is largely original thought to my mind (I am poorly read right now on new horizons in integrating epigenetics into the gene centric view).    In the gene-centric view we don't think of phenotypic traits as being beneficial to an organism on the most primarily level.  All phenotypic traits (even organisms themselves overall) are tools toward replication of genes.  It is important here, that we do not refer to all ""genes"" carried by an organism as a single unit.  Fundamentally, genes are in competition with each other; individual genes trying to copy themselves.   There are many large and small teams of cooperative genes that are not so dependent on each other that they travel as one unit so the survival of one is in the utmost interest of the the other.  Think of these as families. Genes ""help each other"" to the extent their help will bring ultimate benefit toward their singular goal of self-replication.   This view enables some interesting (and frankly sometimes miserable) reconsideration of the circumstance of individual organisms and groups of organisms.  Why do organisms die for instance?  It's by no means a foregone conclusion, but there is significant evidence to support the conclusion that death for the most part is ""programmed in.""  Why shouldn't an organism live in their prime indefinitely, regenerating, growing, reproducing etc.  Some in the gene-centric view believe death is simply a way for gene(s) to maximize their ultimate reproductive potential.    Here is a quote from a paper on Programmed Cell Death in bacteria that can help me illustrate my point:   It is not immediately apparent, to put it mildly, that a defective unicellular organism will benefit from committing suicide. This simple consideration has no doubt impeded a serious inquiry into programmed death in bacteria. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly apparent that bacteria live and die in complex communities that in many ways resemble a multicellular organism. Release of pheromones induces bacteria in a population to respond in concert by changing patterns of gene expression, a phenomenon called quorum sensing (30, 38, 75), and reactive oxygen species cause self-aggregation in Escherichia coli (14), a behavior thought to provide mutual protection to the cells. Most bacterial species actually do not live as planktonic suspensions in vivo but form complex biofilms, tightly knit communities of cells (19). From this perspective, programmed death of damaged cells may be beneficial to a multicellular bacterial community. For example, suicide could limit the spread of a viral infection. In the case of serious damage by toxic factors, cells will donate their nutrients to their neighbors instead of draining resources from their kin in a futile attempt to repair themselves.    As she says programmatic death is not helpful to an organism programmed with it.  But imagine how it could be beneficial to a single progenitor gene in competition with other genotypes generations back. Take the above example of limiting spread of deadly viral infection.  The combination of genes, X programs for a colonial bacterium in the ancestral state, no PCD. The combination of genes, Y is a novel configuration from a simple mutation programming for a colonial bacterium that is inspired to quickly die in the presence of viral proteins. Still no benefit for the Cell 1 with X. But if it makes it through that first generation, or more realistically many more generations by chance (and by not exerting a negative effect on fitness) without encountering the virus or encountering the virus only sporadically... with a colony of X and a colony of Y living in the same environment when a virus invades the system, if it is virulent and deadly beyond a certain threshold colony Y is quickly going to outcompete colony X.  The novel Y configuration of genes could then proliferate and even become fixed.   Examining that relationship between a single gene or genes irrespective of the fitness of the organism it codes for and the proliferation of the gene(s) many generations later seems important to me.   OK, so finally: Programmatic Cell Death in bacteria as discussed above can be viewed conceptually as a response to an environmental factor that has been demonstrated by natural selection to (superficially) positively affect the overall number and distribution of specific gene(s). More correctly, such a response better affects the long term reproductive success of a single progenitor gene or group of cooperating progenitor genes than their competitors.    Extrapolate to complex life, animals, humans. Very many and much more complex environmental factors determine our evolutionary success.  Say important childhood trauma of a certain type in an individual cascades through the generations through affected child-rearing (""cycles"" talked about some social sciences and in other fields that study this all in a much more practical way).  This could feasibly negatively affect in an important way the success of the branching lineage.  Could it be possible that toward maximizing proliferation (just as in the colonies of bacteria) of an ancestral genetic configuration, humans who have the misfortune to experience the environmental factor of important trauma are ""programmed"" to prevent or minimize continuation of their lineage. This would be a far more complicated and nuanced sense of the word ""programmed"" but the abstract concept could be the same.  Bacteria's genes find ways to design responsiveness around the most important factors in their environments, perhaps ours find ways to design around the similarly important factors in our very complex ones.  It can be said in a way (original claim) that you as an organism are not in control of direct fitness--in fact, the genes you carry are not in control of direct fitness over a single generation; it is a configuration of progenitor genes that has shaped your fitness over multiple generation toward its ends.    This possibility is why the topic is such a concerning and unpleasant one to me. Perhaps though in the event this possibility turns out to have some bearing on the actual state of things, in understanding it, we can do something about it. Well, look forward to any debate, correction, conversation on the above subjects. Thanks."
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,Tezcatlipokemon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:11:04 2015 UTC,"Haha- I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you with my limited ability to ""debate, correct, or converse"" on the subject in a way that might add to your understanding. I'm only superficially informed about the science of the whole thing. I'm interested in epigenetics and environmental impacts, but better schooled in the arts than the sciences, except where life circumstances have led me. I don't really have the background to speak intelligently about the scientific side on the level that you seem to be informed about. Still, this is reddit, so why not give my mildly informed opinion on the subject, haha?  I'm also interested in evolutionary biology, and have an interested laymen's knowledge on the subject. So, your theory that damaging parenting might be a way to ""kill off"" less desireable genetic lines certainly makes sense. I spend some time on subs devoted to people dealing with parent inflicted trauma, and chronic illness.  There is definitley a subset who are less inclined to want to have children. There is also a subset who are physically incapable of either reproducing or lack the physical/psychological stamina to devote to child rearing and so forego having kids. My husband and I fall into the latter category.  The only contradiction I can think of against the theory, might be that traumatic childhood experiences seems to be so widespread, it wouldn't make sense to have a mechanism that impacted so many. I think this might have been your original conundrum. Maybe the way to overcome this hurdle, is to take into account the many ways our intellectual evolution has allowed us to hack into pure biological evolution. Survival of the fittest has always really been survival of the most adaptable. Maybe, as you suggested, this mean we CAN do something about it, and turn less desireable genetic traits into more desireable ones, by tinkering with the epigentics of the whole thing. The author of the article linked in the OP writes about epigentics in her book of the same title: Childhood Disrupted. My husband and I are reading it right now, but we haven't gotten to that part yet. It might be worth checking out if you are interested in a better level of understanding about it than I can offer you :)"
Foodforthought,3cf5qs,JustMeRC,3,Thu Jul 16 08:34:37 2015 UTC,"I have to agree that childhold experiences shape who we become, and often in very unfortunate and/or disturbing ways.  I grew up listening to my parents argue about money.  I was occasionally punished physically (belt, hairbrush, open hands) by my mother, who would get unreasonably angry sometimes over things that weren't big deals.  I was expected to obey and respect my parents, but they showed me constant examples of how adults and authority figures are not superior, infallible beings.  Hypocrisy was a constant companion, and it made me grow up bitter.  Because I was quiet, shy and introspective I had a tough time making friends.  Those who tolerated or befriended me still thought I was a weird kid.  This became doubly so after moving from the country into a city, where the customs and culture were totally different.  I failed to adjust properly and retreated inward to find escape.  I went through year after year of teachers telling me I had enormous potential, if only I would apply myself.  I never did.  I saw no reason to other than to please my parents or the school administration, and I didn't respect any of them.  The school was not set up in such a way as to encourage strange kids like me to succeed.  They wanted to shoehorn me into a set university/career path as early as grade 9, and that really repelled me.  Anyway, after many years of being an outcast, viewing my parents and other adults as hypocrites, politicians and police as corrupt liars and even my own peers as mean or unfair, I developed a strong desire to be alone.  I'm now in my 30s and would best describe myself as a loner who perhaps doesn't ""hate"" other people, but who isn't far of from being a full-blown misanthrope.  I have zero respect for authority or for laws I don't personally agree with (I don't even acknowledge that other people have the right to apply laws to me, given that I am not a servant or subject).  I am completely emotionally insensitive.  I don't care when bad things happen to others and often enjoy when chaotic, negative events occur.  Honestly, I'm not even sure if I really view other people as ""people.""  If I think about it rationally I, of course, understand that people are people with minds and thoughts of their own.  Day-to-day, however, people are just animated furniture who often annoy me or get in my way.  Exceptions are my wife, my few close friends and some of the people I see at work.  I used to think I was just really introverted, but then I did some research and considered that I was simply sociopathic.  Not satisfied with that answer, I did more reading and finally settled on schizoid personality disorder (of the ""hidden schizoid"" subtype, since I'm good at pretending I'm a friendly, sociable guy).  Honestly, I'm not even sure if that's what's wrong with me.  If it is, however, I can't help but feel it came about as a result of my childhood experiences.  My mother often spoke of how I was such a ""nice, happy boy"" when I was under 5.  If that were true, the boy died a long time ago.  People need to either avoid associating with children, or treat them with respect and dignity.  When they want answers, give them answers instead of hypocritical nonsense ""parent answers.""

Foodforthought,3cf5qs,iEATu23,2,Fri Jul 17 15:31:35 2015 UTC,"Here is one of the studies mentioned in the article, linking Adverse childhood experiences and prescription drug use.   For instance, those with ACE scores greater than or equal to 7 who didn’t drink or smoke, weren’t overweight or diabetic, and didn’t have high cholesterol still had a 360 per cent higher risk of heart disease than those with ACE scores of 0.   Can someone please find the journal article for this?   Recent studies indicate that individuals who practice mindfulness meditation and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) show an increase in gray matter in parts of the brain associated with managing stress, and experience shifts in genes that regulate their stress response and their levels of inflammatory hormones. Other research suggests that a process known as neurofeedback can help to regrow connections in the brain that were lost to adverse childhood experiences.   Interesting, but these things have already been known for thousands of years.   Meditation, mindfulness, neurofeedback, cognitive therapy, EMDR (eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing) therapy: these promising new avenues to healing can be part of any patient’s recovery plan   So until medical providers figure out a way to monetize treatments, there won't be public health support for this sort of thing.

With criticism I believe their parents were acting out their pain and kids didn't have enough supply of love to deal with or didn't know how to deal with it (other than giving into criticism) or both.

Foodforthought,3cf5qs,JustMeRC,4,Wed Jul 8 07:07:43 2015 UTC,"It's more complicated than just adding love to the situation. My husband grew up with a mentally ill mother, and he fits in perfectly with the thesis of the article. His mother is not a bad person, and even sees herself as the most loving mother around. She even showed love in many acceptable, normal ways when he was growing up. Yet, it was peppered by her harsh and frightening ways of getting the results she wanted out of her children. All three have severe anxiety and chronic health problems as adults.  My husband even has a stable father, who is his best friend, and was nothing but loving and supportive throughout his life. He is also in a very loving relationship with me, which has been going on for 15 years.   Despite being loved and supported, his system keeps pumping out stress hormones in an over-reactive way, every day of his life. It's taken him until very recently, with much persuasion, to get help and therapy for it. Still, there's uncertainty about how much can be undone.  Yes, love is necessary, for sure.  Still, what we need are effective treatments that work with the neuroplasticity of the brain. There are neuro-feedback systems out there, but they are still considered experimental, largely not covered by insurance, and very pricey. CBT, EMDR, and other options are out there, but could still be improved upon.  I've loved my husband supportively and unconditionally since we've been together. Still, you can't shut off the stresses of life and work. As long as those exist, a person who has been damaged in childhood is still receiving the drip, drip, drip of stress hormones that keeps them locked in anxiety and ill health, no matter how much they are loved."

Now imagine a knob on your system that is turned up to maximum volume, which makes you more sensitive to everything in your environment, and every thought running through your head.  If the average person's body pumps out 5 drops of stress hormones in relation to stressors, his pumps out 50. It overreacts (and/or has over-sensitive receptors to these hormones).  This is because his system was trained by his experiences with his mentally ill mother, to be on constant alert for her unpredictable, explosive, random and frightening over-reactions to everything.  Think of it like living in a war zone, where bombs explode regularly around you, and you never know when the next one is coming, or how close to you it's going to land. Even if you move away from the war zone, your system will always be on the alert. It's very much like shell-shock.

If you train a dog to repond a certain way every time you press a clicker, that dog will always repspond the clicker, unless there is retraining or other intervention to undo the conditioning. He was conditioned to respond to her, to be alert to her, and to hide the parts of him that made her angry, even though those parts were perfectly normal.  He needed safety and stability.

Foodforthought,3cf5qs,JustMeRC,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:15:46 2015 UTC,"There was an article in the NY Times recently called, Can the Bacteria in Your Gut Explain your Mood. There's an excerpt in it about the fight or flight response and how it's shown to have a biological impact on the organisms which make up one's gut bacteria. It may explain another mechanism by which the stress feedback loop becomes imprinted, and additional avenues for interventions.   In 2011, a team of researchers at University College Cork, in Ireland, and McMaster University, in Ontario, published a study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science that has become one of the best-known experiments linking bacteria in the gut to the brain. Laboratory mice were dropped into tall, cylindrical columns of water in what is known as a forced-swim test, which measures over six minutes how long the mice swim before they realize that they can neither touch the bottom nor climb out, and instead collapse into a forlorn float. Researchers use the amount of time a mouse floats as a way to measure what they call ‘‘behavioral despair.’’ (Antidepressant drugs, like Zoloft and Prozac, were initially tested using this forced-swim test.)  For several weeks, the team, led by John Cryan, the neuroscientist who designed the study, fed a small group of healthy rodents a broth infused with Lactobacillus rhamnosus, a common bacterium that is found in humans and also used to ferment milk into probiotic yogurt. Lactobacilli are one of the dominant organisms babies ingest as they pass through the birth canal. Recent studies have shown that mice stressed during pregnancy pass on lowered levels of the bacterium to their pups. This type of bacteria is known to release immense quantities of GABA; as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA calms nervous activity, which explains why the most common anti-anxiety drugs, like Valium and Xanax, work by targeting GABA receptors.  Cryan found that the mice that had been fed the bacteria-laden broth kept swimming longer and spent less time in a state of immobilized woe. ‘‘They behaved as if they were on Prozac,’’ he said. ‘‘They were more chilled out and more relaxed.’’ The results suggested that the bacteria were somehow altering the neural chemistry of mice."
Foodforthought,3ckoyf,wawayanda,2,Wed Jul 8 17:41:06 2015 UTC,"Pretty interesting article. But it seems a bit like it was more about women learning from men than visa versa.  The author uses the example of braiding his daughters hair to illustrate his idea:   In the first view, the manly thing to do if you find yourself in my position is not to braid your daughter’s hair, because that’s not what men do. In the second, the manly thing is to do it, because you’re a grownup responsible for a little girl, and this one little thing will make her day better. You can do it, so you should.   But that seems to miss the mark completely. It was an example of a man learning femininity rather than a man learning manliness from a woman.  If you ask me, the archetypical ""manly"" thing to do in this situation would be to put his daughters hair in a ponytail and teach her the importance of character over appearances.  Joan and OKeefe are excellent examples of women either born/raised manly or adapting to succeed in a Man's world. Their incredibly successful adoption of masculinity while still preserving their femininity is definitely remarkable, but do they really have more to teach men about masculinity than the men they learned from?  Does Brienne of Tarth from Game of Thrones have anything to teach men about archetypical masculinity other than successfully emobdying it? Does she have more to teach to men than Khal Drogo? The Hound? Stannis, Tyrion or Tywin?   It reminds me of the other night, when my wife and I were watching the end of the TV series The Fall. About Gillian Anderson, she said, “Her skin! It’s just so good.”  Her skin?  I don’t think I’ve ever commented on another person’s skin. I don’t think I’ve ever noticed another person’s skin, unless something horrible was going on with it. I realized, when my wife said that, that we were watching the show in entirely different ways. But is that it? Is that the big, essential difference between men and women? I have an endless memory for football games, and she notices other people’s skin and the hems of their skirts?  Of course it’s not...   But... it kind of is. If you're going to use stoic or aggressive behavior as some marker and badge of masculinity, why aren't they willing to consider and appreciation or infatuation with beauty as a marker of feminity? Of course it's not the ""essential difference between men and women"" but if we're willing to define masculinity and femininity at all, we probably have to accept that yes, manly men do not fret over their, or others' complexion, just like Brienne doesn't and that's part of what makes her a masculine character."
Foodforthought,3ckoyf,Siegecow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:02:38 2015 UTC,I am not sure how braided hair is a hallmark of an appearance driven life especially when your other option is a ponytail.   A man not being held back by societal beliefs pertaining to what he stereotypically should and shouldn't do would braid the girls hair it isn't hard and you get quality time with her where instead of a lecture about your own views on appearance and character you could ask her what she thinks.   In this case it is more impact full to guide a child to make up their own mind then to simply lay out for them what you feel is correct

What I personally took from the article is that at the end of the day we are all human, and are susceptable to all the same insecurities. It just so apparently happens that insecurity does not decrease with wealth.  It's easy for me, someone who would classify themselves as ""lower middle class"", to imagine what it would be like to be wealthy. To pretend that I wouldn't waste the opportunities in my life, how never having to work would be a blessing and I'd fill my days with new and interesting hobbies. I'd learn to play the piano, archery, boating etc. etc. But I know in reality I'd probably just end up doing the same things I do now, go home and play on my computer.

Foodforthought,3chfv4,BonzoTheBoss,5,Thu Jul 9 14:35:06 2015 UTC,"I remember reading studies that showed that income more than about 70 K a year, or about 40% more than basic needs do not provide any more happiness or security. (This was obviously a while ago, and it does depend where you live; for instance in NY today, that amount would barely get you by). So, adjust for constant dollars and you have the same paradigm.   I inherited a large sum, not a million, but a lot by my standards. My brother blew through his within a couple years, but I put away most in CD's and savings, but have worn it down to about half it was once worth. I was able to build a small house to live in mortgage free. The problem was, I always had money lying around for many years and I was always binging on Amazon. I didn't buy very expensive things, but was spending about a grand a mo on things I didn't really need. I had become a shopping addict. I commonly spent $50 or more on tiny decorative trinkets.   The point is that you become numb to the true value of money. I began to realize that I was spending on needless things while others worked hard just to pay rent, food and basic essentials. I still tap my reserves, but now mostly for basic needs and home repairs. I also have other sources of income and don't have to work. But that does leave you socially isolated and the friends I have gathered would eventually tell me that they resented the fact that I did not need to work when they were out there busting their ass just to make ends meets.  So, it is a blessing and a curse. I was living on a poverty scale income before I got the money, so I know what it is like to be poor. I valued every dollar and relished every time I was able to buy something. I've been on both sides now, and neither one is enviable. Would that we were better psychologically equipped to deal with this thing called money.  It is, however the American Way. Love of money is our culture. We do not have a old culture such as Europe, so ours is the dream of being rich. It is so seeped in our culture, that poor people vote for the interests of the wealthy (republican), because they hope be rich one day. As the saying goes, in America, the poor are led to believe or perhaps simply come to believe that they are simply temporarily frustrated millionaires. The truth is quite a bit darker, as the void between the 1 percenters, who own 40% of the nation's wealth, has worsened dramatically since the housing bust of 2008.

Foodforthought,3casve,Redwheeler,37,Tue Jul 7 13:54:18 2015 UTC,"A scary effect of the internet is that extremely uncommon beliefs and viewpoints now have a huge sounding board to find like-minded individuals all over the world. This isn't a problem if we're talking about furries, or my little pony, or people who all like to wear mismatched socks or something, but it gets interesting when you're looking at groups centered around hating a certain type of people, or causing pain/destruction to others or any thousand other Bad Ideas.  This can lead to extremist ""echo-chambers,"" where people are surrounding themselves with similar or identical viewpoints all the time, which reinforces and strengthens their extremist ideas. This is why I think so-called ""hate groups"" are so poisonous to a civil society these days. Once an idea gets more than one person shouting about it, it turns from the ramblings of the village idiot into just another supported viewpoint in the myriad ideas about how society should operate.  I'm all for free speech and letting people shout about whatever they want as long as they don't take action that harms others. But these types of groups seem to often be the fuel on the fire that can push someone with a screw or two loose over the edge into taking harmful action against others in the name of a Bad Idea.  Edit: Multiple people have brought up how long the KKK has been around. I want to clarify that I do not think the following points are mutually exclusive:   The internet strengthens extremism through an ""echo chamber"" effect. The KKK used to be more prevalent/violent/powerful/accepted/whatever than they are today, and they've been around a long time. The internet currently today helps white supremacists to ""stay in business"" through online forums, blogs, and podcasts. There are other, more modern, much more technically literate, much more violent hate groups who have become adept at using the internet in an unprecedented manner to spread their ideals and recruit followers from all over the world. The internet (+media attention) also keeps ISIS in business at the moment.   I really think people underestimate how much the accessibility of the internet, especially to the younger generations, allows an idea (good or bad) to spread like a virus in a way that I don't think we've even fully comprehended yet. I believe this type of communication and social interaction is categorically different from hate-based chain mail, book clubs, and protest rallies."

The article suffers from this kind of dubious reasoning as well, with claims like this:   But precisely because the movement is more atomized and has been rendered more anonymous by the Internet, law enforcement officials say it has become harder to track potentially violent lone-wolf terrorists who might draw inspiration from white supremacist sites without being actively involved in the organizations.   Where is the data to back this up? Isn't violent crime decreasing in the US? Or are racist hate crimes an exception to this rule?

It didn't take the internet for people to be inspired by racial hatred.   I don't think it was collectively agreed upon by society that racism was generally a bad thing at the time. It seems to me more like a trend over time towards more freedoms and away from racial hostility. I think the Klan back in the day was far more of a point on the trend-line, whereas modern hate groups come off as aberrations bucking the trend or regressing back to previous ideals that we as a society have already deemed Bad Ideas.   Do you think the Klan back in the day was any less of an echo chamber than some of these online forums are today?   I think it's important not only to compare action-for-action and member-for-member of the modern white supremacist against the classic Klansman, but to look at the base rates of these ideas in society during the time periods in question, and compare how far off from general societal consensus they are. I'm not arguing the Klan is objectively worse today than it was in it's heyday, I'm arguing that the deviations from the norm are more extreme today than they used to be.  I would argue that a modern racist is more of an extremist than a Klansman at the height of the KKK when you look at the difference from the base rate in society. A better comparison for me for the time period of the Klan back in the day would maybe be a group of Luddites, who, despite the industrial revolution and society's general embrace of technology and industry, argued that technology would be society's downfall, and actually riled themselves up enough to get someone to walk into an assembly-line factory and start shooting people."
Foodforthought,3casve,AlterdCarbon,3,Mon Jul 6 21:45:50 2015 UTC,"This is unrelated to your larger point, but you've gotten the Luddites vastly wrong.   despite the industrial revolution and society's general embrace of technology and industry, argued that technology would be society's downfall,   They were definitely not anti-technology, they were pro-labor.  Luddites realized that their method of labor was outdated. This was a given. They also saw that the new jobs that were replacing them were really shitty in pay and dignity despite being much more productive for capital owners. So they protested by smashing machines, effectively causing a mechanical strike that could not be opted out of.  There were deadly clashes, show trials, and the British Parliament made ""Machine Breaking"" punishable by death. The Luddite movement soon ended.  But Capitalism kept going, kept exploiting, and as a direct consequence has spawned a thousand other similar movements as well as Marxism/Anarchism.  ""Neo-Luddites"" are far closer to the popular vision of what Luddites were, but they're modern."

Something seriously bad has to happen for that kind of stuff to start gaining a hold in the mainstream.   They are fine in their little circlejerks but when they come out in the open they look grubby and sad and people (even people on 4chan) can see that usually.    But these types of groups seem to often be the fuel on the fire that can push someone with a screw or two loose over the edge into taking harmful action against others in the name of a Bad Idea.   Imo this is true of virtually every group, there have been (very badly) attempted murders of anti gay marriage politicians, and people have tried to set some guy's house on fire because he made a film called 'hot girls of occupy wall street'. The kind of escalating hyperbole, witch hunts and threat narratives seem somewhat involved in some violent incidents but others seem not to be related, social isolation and mental illness also seem to play a role in more of them.

Foodforthought,3casve,scribble_child,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:59:46 2015 UTC,"how could anyone argue against the above list of facts?   Firstly, these facts are not in support of discrimination or prejudice.  They do not indicate that a better society is one where black people are pushed down, ignored, hated, considered inferior, and so on.  The actions of racism.  The belief black people ought to be treated as scum, inferior, and so on, is nothing but harmful to society in every form and/or way.  Even if this list were 100 percent showing some form of inferiority, then it would not support racism of any form regardless.    As for the points themselves, they seem to be three main things.  Black people commit more crime.  Black people have less stable families.  Black people have lower IQ scores, even when adjusted for a wealthy family.  Firstly, a massive number of these facts can be adjusted for things such as poverty, stereotype threat, culture, and so on.    Crime rates is largely caused by a larger amount of police presence and hostility in black neighborhoods, the existence of gangs inside of many areas where large number of black people live, and the amount of poverty in those areas.    Family is again, a product of that environment.  Poverty leads to stress, which leads to less happy families, which leads to more divorce, which leads to less well raised kids, which leads to poverty, and the cycle repeats.  The IQ scores are a bit more interesting, and I could very well see it being a valid point.  However, the amount of disparity in the wealth of black people in general does not accurately reflect a lower average, and the lowering in IQ is not indicative of capability to function or participate in a society.  You don't need a high IQ to manage a business, for instance, where ability to handle stressful situations easily may be more handy.  One disadvantage can (almost inherently) lead to other advantages, and by focusing purely on IQ, you are ignoring the benefits the ""black genetic makeup"" gives in return for that being lower on average.  For instance, you won't find many black Olympic swimmers, but you will find many runners.  It's not inferiority, it's differences, and by embracing and encouraging people to do what they are best suited for, without putting them down and hindering them, we can build a better society overall.    Now, I understand you will probably see ""poverty causes all of it"" and scoff a bit.  However, I am not saying that entirely.  I do agree with you in that it isn't just poverty, it's also culture, ideals, and other issues that cause the issues black people face, and many of those are caused and spread by modern black people.    I agree entirely that the gang culture, the crime, the ""otherness"" to society that exists in ghettos needs to go away.  ""Black culture"" does need to change, in those aspects.  However, it isn't going to change naturally.  I discuss this elsewhere, but human beings are the result of their conditions, and you can't expect someone raised in sub-par conditions to miraculously raise above them.  Yes, it will happen in some cases, but not enough to change a society.  So it is our duty, not as white people, not as ""the oppressors"", none of that bullshit, it's our duty as citizens of whatever nation we are in, to attempt to improve and create a better society.    It is up to us to look at the issues that face black people, the things that cause their poverty, and try to reverse them.  Because if we do, we will have a subset of the population doing far better than they ever did in the past, leading to a better economy, leading to more happy people able to access the things they want.  You are included in those people.    So we need to fix that poverty, we need to fix that culture.  And we can't do that while saying these people deserve mistreatment, we can't do that while putting people down.  We have to have programs that give money to families in the form of food stamps and such to allow them to live better lives.  We need to crack down on gangs.  We need to put money and development into black neighborhoods.  If there is a course of action we can take, that reduces poverty, and does so far more efficiently than any other action we can do, then why shouldn't we do it?"

A simpler example would be banks/checking.  If you're broke, you can't always get a good deal on banking.  Living check to check is a great way to accidentally overdraft and screw up your checking account.  So you're stuck using check cashing shops and other crappy options that only make things worse with big fees and cuts.  I've seen this in my own personal life as I spent several years stuck in that cycle and you really need to get to a certain point before you can even access the tools to improve your finances or career outlook.  Internet access and education falls under that umbrella for a lot of people.  If you're poor, you often get priced out of ""good"" access and are stuck with shitty pay-as-you-go mobile and metered wireless access.

Even then, I feel a bit uneasy to take his claims at face value because I feel he could have easily misdirected or swindled me.

Basically he's saying that this whole thing is amounting to Germany and the EU wanting to use Greece as a scapegoat or a punching bag to take their anger out on. And from the beginning, everyone involved knew that this would be the outcome (or at the very least that it was likely), and that Greece is no more to blame than the people who permitted this to happen. That means that by Greece saying ""fuck it, we're not going to kill ourselves or become slaves to repay this debt"", they are boldly saying ""no, we do not take sole responsibility for this problem that you had an equal hand in, if not greater."" Then he says that now that Greece has done this, the ball is in the EU's court - will they step up and realize the immorality that has amounted to this type of practice and enact change, or will the machine move forward full steam ahead?  That's basically his big point. Now in my opinion the brilliance of Zizek is not just the ideas he presents (though they do give me shivers), but rather the way in which he presents them. I feel I have fairly accurately given an ELI5 of this article, but it was only a few sentences. So why is the article so damn long and complicated?

As much as I hate to say it (as  a Greek-Canadian myself), the anticipated outcome was likely, they should be on the hook and do something, right?."
Foodforthought,3c9idw,arjun10,10,Mon Jul 6 03:41:28 2015 UTC,"The UK defaulted on WWI debts owed to the US in 1932 and reduced interest payments for gilts (bonds) in the same year, citing the failure of Germany to pay reparations and subsequent loss of income as the cause. Then, according to Reinhart, Carmen, and Rogoff, Kenneth in “The Forgotten History of Domestic Debt.” (NBER: 2008) we have a whole slew of various defaults. An interesting point because, as Piketty has said elsewhere, the U.K. has never defaulted.  But, and here we can only speculate as to what Piketty meant, which is a common experience because what Piketty writes must be felt as much as actually understood, since the U.K agreed with their lenders to alter the terms of repayment before the debt was due, restructured, they never in fact failed to make scheduled coupon payments or repay the debt at maturity. Either the U.S. never called on the debt, or some other financial jiggery got the U.K. out of a tight spot.  But then, we have here, the seeming argument that a restructuring of debt is still a default on the debt. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the bond holder wiped out, but any failure to pay interest and/or principal in full and on time, even a late payment, is a default. Thus, even though Germany did repay reparations fully in 2009, because some was forgiven, and their then-repayment plan by its very nature made its original payments (very) late, QED, Germany defaulted.  Ah Piketty, never change."
Foodforthought,3c9idw,FrolickingAround,25,Mon Jul 6 15:01:23 2015 UTC,"Ugh. Once again, I find myself battling a migraine trying to parse Piketty's arguments. I acknowledge he writes/speaks of good, or at least interesting ideas, but I indict him for either sloppy reasoning, or using what I can only infer as specially political definitions of words.   But wait: history shows us two ways for an indebted state to leave delinquency. One was demonstrated by the British Empire in the 19th century after its expensive wars with Napoleon. It is the slow method that is now being recommended to Greece. The Empire repaid its debts through strict budgetary discipline. This worked, but it took an extremely long time. For over 100 years, the British gave up two to three percent of their economy to repay its debts, which was more than they spent on schools and education. That didn’t have to happen, and it shouldn’t happen today. The second method is much faster. Germany proved it in the 20th century. Essentially, it consists of three components: inflation, a special tax on private wealth, and debt relief.   First, it needs to be emphasized that Piketty is speaking of things that can cause a country to leave delinquency, not things that a country can do itself. Debt relief can only be bestowed by the lender, not the lendee, so this amounts to an argument that the Euro currency, and EU are valuable enough to Germany, France, etc. to extend debt relief to Greece.   But this feels like wishful thinking to me at best. Germany, France etc, do want the EU and Euro to hold, and I think they really do want Greece to be self-sufficiant, but they want to know they won't have to keep relieving debt. That's why they are demanding austerity from Greece. In the long-term, the EU doesn't work if it is perpetually bailing out a particular member, and Greece's deficit spending has been fairly long-term. Both austerity and debt-relief are painful to the parties involved. The facts-on-the-ground of the negotiating floor may be such that there can be a Greece with the Euro and austerity, or a Greece with neither, but not a Greece with only one.  Secondly, unless I am misreading him and he is in fact calling for Euro-wide inflation, inflation for Greece necessitates being outside the Euro currency with a new Drachma, which while certainly feasible, goes against what I think Piketty is arguing for with respect to EU cohesion.  Thirdly, I have philosophical problems with his ""tax the wealth rather than the income"" plan. It is on its face an abrogation of both Privacy and of the idea that government should not hold the power of ""Takings"" without compensation.  This is Piketty pressing his proposed solution to wealth inequality at the expense of more traditional measures such as progressive income taxation.  I have a hard time with other parts of this article, but rather than just nitpick Piketty, I would like to extend a few ideas of my own.  There are more ways than Piketty speaks of here that a debt problem can be dealt with. A country could cede territory, or even its entire sovereignty in the face of debt. This has happened in living memory; it happened to Newfoundland in 1949. Greece could set itself up as a kind of Mercenary headquarters sending troops to foreign conflicts in return for lucrative contracts. Something similar to this happened when the US tried to buy itself a coalition at the outset of the invasion of Iraq. In either case, Greece trades something for cash/debt relief. The point is that there are other ways than are presented in this article to deal with debt.  edit: spelling"
Foodforthought,3c9idw,Bacteriophages,29,Mon Jul 6 07:56:47 2015 UTC,"This is a great response, but I would just like to point out that if you want further clarification on why Piketty jumps so quickly to taxing wealth, you should read his book (Capital in the 21st Century).   I know how you feel about his arguments, I get the same feeling sometimes, but it's becoming pretty apparent in the modern era that a tax on wealth of some kind is going to need to be implemented if we don't want to see an even more powerful aristocracy/""plutocracy."""

Let's not do that.   Edit: I'll expand. Because I think a wealth tax is both unjust and literally impossible to implement. A transactional tax is not. And that's why we use that.   What if I bought my house before the market crashed. I had an unrealized store of wealth for years that you want to tax based on how much it might be worth if I sold it.   Well, now the market crashes. And I have an asset worth half of what you told me it was theoretically worth.   Example number two. I have a store of commodities in location A. It is worth very little locally, but if I could manage to sell it a thousand miles away, it would be worth substantially more. Based on which value will you tax it?   I have bitcoin. The value fluctuated by a factor of 50% of its value in less than a year. Based on its value on what day will you tax it?   And so on.   Who defines wealth? How is its value assessed? How do we know this unless there is an actual transaction through which its value is very concretely defined?   A wealth tax is a pipe dream. There is no way to agree upon a value of something until it is sold. Period."
Foodforthought,3c9idw,dkinmn,8,Mon Jul 6 16:01:36 2015 UTC,"While I agree that a wealth tax is a pipe dream, none of the issues you're pointing out are the actual issues that would cause a wealth tax to not work (not to mention, they don't seem like difficult problems to fix; e.g. ""Who defines wealth?"" The markets define wealth. If you buy something that fluctuates that much, sucks for you. Invest better. I'm not saying I agree with that, but in simple terms, that's how wealth is defined today).    It's the scale that's the problem. There's just not enough global interest in a wealth tax, and no one country can implement it without it driving wealth from it's country.   But honestly, if you really aren't convinced, it's most likely because you haven't read the actual data.   If you're actually interested in the subject, you should read Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century, and/or The Plutocrats by Chrystia Freeland, and/or The Price of Inequality by Joseph Stiglitz, and/or Inequality Reexamined by Amartya Sen. Those might give you a better understanding of why people categorize the wealth tax--or some other solution to the r>g problem--""needs"" to be implemented. Once you've seen the issues it's causing, and the immensity of it, it's pretty insane to think we don't need a solution.    There is no way to agree on the price of something until it is sold. Period.    And honestly not trying to be a dick here, but this is just blatantly wrong due to overly simplistic terms. Of course we can agree on price before something sells. How else is price determined? Price is a natural precursor to purchase."

The one that happens when someone else actually sells something.   And you get to announce that it's ""insane"" to think we don't need a solution. Fine. I think the wealth tax, based very much on my very real examples, is not a solution.   Edit: Downvote isn't disagree.   If someone has an answer to exactly how a wealth tax is to be implemented, jump in and contribute.   My questions are legitimate, and have to be answered in order to know how this tax is meant to work.   How about one more problem with a theoretical tax?   I have a classic car that is worth x dollars on the current market. A wealth tax creates an incentive for me and everyone else who owns that car to sell. Due to that, we've just increased the supply, and therefore changed the theoretical market price that is the basis for your tax.   The wealth tax would require perfect knowledge of a market price that is not set. It would require an army of auditors to check to see that everyone is accurately claiming the value of their wealth. It's a boondoggle, and it solves literally nothing beyond satiating a hunger to punish the wealthy."

I was actually addressing your bitcoin example, not the housing investment. The housing bubble is a whole other tale that's beyond the scope of this reddit comment.   The issues you raised have more to do with the details of who gets taxed and how much. And honestly, if you lost a ton of money due to your housing investments during the 2007-2009 Financial Crisis, you're probably not one of the people who would be affected by a wealth tax.   I think you're seriously misunderstanding the purpose of the ""wealth tax"" argument. Hell, Piketty himself (the guy who really first proposed the idea) admits is a pipe dream in the same book where he proposes it. What he's saying is that something needs to be done, and the wealth tax was the simplest (in terms of conception, not implementation) solution he could conceive of.   On top of that, a wealth tax is just supposed to stem the excessive growths of obscenely large wealth, not taxing the average investors portfolio. It's less about raising tax revenue, and more about balancing the scales.   Wealth disparity causes huge issues on the societies where it arises.  There are massive drops in social capital and social trust, there are discrepancies in how individuals are treated by the legal system, and there are detrimental effects on the overall economy. We're already seeing a lot of this in the US, and it's only going to get worse.   Honestly, you seem really flared up about this, which is understandable. Wealth, taxes, inequality--these are all difficult topics to discuss.   But I would again urge you to actually read the literature on the subject if it's a topic you care about. I completely agree that a wealth tax isn't feasible, if you go back and read my actual comment, you'll see I'm saying that something should be done, and it's ""insane"" to think otherwise. I could try to explain some of these authors arguments, but my own understanding requires more depth and polishing--and I worry my bastardized versions would be an insult to the authors' incredible works.

Foodforthought,3c9idw,joker_RED,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"Guilty as charged for not having read the whole book as of today, but I am familiar with the bulk of its arguments through extracts, summaries, counter-arguments, etc.   There are two points that I think are relevant here though.  Firstly, a wealth tax is a form of austerity. All tax increases are. But wealth taxes are the form of tax that Piketty favors as policy. There may be good economic theory behind this (for example, lump-sum taxes tend to not have the same negative economic effects as income taxes), but he doesn't make that argument here. Thus, it is a bit disingenuous of him to argue against further austerity while simultaneously holding up his particular favored brand of austerity as part of the solution.  Secondly, there already exist policies analogous to wealth taxes. Inheritance taxes are one-time wealth taxes. Property taxes are annual taxes on the wealth derived from the value of one's land, capitol gains taxes are taxes on the increase in wealth due to asset value gain. Again, I am at a disadvantage for not reading his whole book, but I seem to recall that Piketty dismisses these things as insufficient by virtue of the fact that they already exist, yet he still finds increasing inequality in his data.  Given these two points, the article as written feels to me like he is trying to shoe-horn in his ideas about wealth inequality into a debate about debt problems at the expense of other ideas. They are certainly not mutually exclusive, but they are not quite the same thing either."
Foodforthought,3c9idw,Bacteriophages,17,Mon Jul 6 19:24:55 2015 UTC,"I think I could summarize the differences between you and Piketty by stating that he thinks like an economist, and you don't. That's not meant as an insult, but rather as a way of pointing out that you ignore the economic content of his ideas and then criticize them on political our moral grounds. You are talking past him.  For example, you say that inflation is not possible for Greece without ending our participation in the euro. Well that is really the heart of the problem, not something he is overlooking. This is a classic path to paying down debt that is unavailable to Greece because it is in a currency area that had a monetary policy that is inappropriate for it. Piketty is not overlooking this, he is pointing at it, and implicitly asking Europe to assess the shortcomings of its currency union as it currently exists.  A lot of non economists view this as a morality tale in which Greece must suffer, but to economists that is nonsense. No economic theory views austerity or suffering as optimal. Inflation, debt forgiveness, wealth taxes are all superior, by a mile."
Foodforthought,3c9idw,loanshark,2,Mon Jul 6 14:10:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I didn't take it as an insult, and I appreciate the effort of civility, but I still disagree with the sentiment. I am explicit where I criticize Piketty on philosophical grounds, but the point about inflation is a logical contradiction to Piketty's desire for Greece to not leave the Euro currency.   BLAST! The article has dissapeared, so I cannot go back for the exact quote, but I recall that in the article, Piketty argues against Greece dropping the Euro currency because he feels it will lead to a domino effect of increases pressure on Spain, Itally, Ireland, etc. I could have misunderstood him, but I think he is saying that it is important to find a solution that does not involve Greece leaving the Euro currency.   Piketty seems to favor European cohesion, both politically, and monetarily. My observation is that on an economic level, inflation as a solution to the debt problem only seems viable under one of two conditions. Either the Euro itself depreciates making the inflation effect all partner countries, or Greece leaves the Euro and depreciates the new Drachma. I don't see him make any arguments for the first case, and the second case contradicts his stated goal of European cohesion."

What economists can do is predict the outcome of the different scenarios laid out. Which outcome is preferable then is almost always a matter of your personal ideological and moral convictions. Sure in some cases you can say ""option A and option B results in the same thing, only option B results in more of it so you'd be a fool to not go with option B"", but in reality when talking about national economies it's more like ""we have option A and option B. Option A has these pros and these cons, option B has these pros and these cons. Whichever is preferable is then heavily dependant on your convictions and how much you personally are affected by the pros and cons.  Don't make it out like his opinions are automatically superior because he's an economist. It's not as if there aren't other economists out there who support different solutions based on their convictions.  Being an economist means you have more insight into the outcomes of different measures but once the options and their projections are laid out its all about personal values and my preference is as valid as yours."

If you really believe that Piketty himself is not making a political argument or that Piketty believes economics and politics to be two circles of a Venn diagram with very little overlap then I am afraid that I must tell you that no one is talking past him except for you.   For crying out loud, Capital in the Twenty-First Century begins with a quote from the Declaration of the Rights of Man, a document whose political importance so far outweighs any 'pure' economic meaning that it is certainly the former and not latter whose significance Piketty seeks to convey. He then follows it up with an introduction that squarely places his arguments, his sympathies and his thinking in what any reader would call politics. As he bluntly states, the reason he wrote this book is because the ""...political debate about the distribution of wealth has long been based on an abundance of prejudice and paucity of fact."" C'mon. Turning around and saying that he is some ur-economist who has left the realms of moralizing and politics behind is nonsense.

You seem to not realize that inequality can be discussed on economic terms outside of politics and morals. Your quote about the paucity of data is kind of the point here... People can feel and campaign on whatever they want, but the economics are a different debate that requires data and math and rigor. The core of Piketty's book is about data and economic theory about what causes inequality.  Not that I was talking about inequality, by the way.   Go cry out loud, whatever. Piketty was responding to widely held ideas that Greece's debt problem is morally wrong and they must suffer for it. On economic grounds, that's nonsense."

Unfortunately Picketty doesn't realize this either. Should you tell him the bad news, or should I?   The data, as far as Piketty is concerned, is meaningless outside politics. He is not making a rational argument because  there is no economic rationale for why economic inequality is bad, or why we should view it as something other than a positive.   As he himself writes, and here I believe he gets at his ultimate point, ""Hence the idea that we are about to bequeath a shameful burden of debt... and that we ought to wear sackcloth and ashes and beg for forgiveness simply makes no sense... What is true and shameful, on the other hand, is that this vast national wealth is very unequally distributed."" There is no data point for defining what makes any distribution actively shameful. We only have to ask ourselves what are the data points for, of all things, 'shame' within any field? Do we carry the two, divide by seven, and multiply by...? Yet Piketty attempts to deny the 'shame' of debt and hammer home the 'shame' of inequality.   Piketty is making a political argument, first and foremost. Understand that. The economics is, at best, a useful means. Trying to extricate some ur-economist from Piketty-as-a-human is to fail to understand him and his argument at their most basic level.

One of the key issues that we have seen with Greece is a continued failure to reform.   If, in past years, decisions in Europe had been reached in more democratic ways, the current austerity policy in Europe would be less strict.   Turkeys voting for Christmas? Austerity is an issue and I really do believe that careful public spending could help. However it will not work everywhere because the economies would not have sufficient ability to ensure that money was being spent correctly.

I have never seen a country turn around and recreate their entire tax collections infrastructure, and you can bet that if that's done too quickly, people will be more willing to increase tax fraud.  Just as an example, Argentina's current tax regime has become oppresively high because rates have not been adjusted to inflation in years, and the consequence of that is that everyone and their mother has put their money in offshore accounts. Had rates been more acceptable, this would not have happened, and would have also reduced the number of fraudsters, making the auditing process easier for the tax agency."

I first overcame severe clinical depression (I was borderline suicidal for most of 1976) before starting my own company.  I think part of the startup / depression problem is unrealistic expectations, such as ""I'm smart! How hard could this be?"" (short answer: harder than you could ever imagine) and / or ""I didn't make $10 gazillion in the first quarter ... I'm an abject failure."" (No, you're not. Now dust yourself off, get out of the office for a while (because there is more to life), acknowledge the things you did get right, and then go back for round 2 ... and 3 ... and 4 ... Lather. Rinse.

It also meant I was more prone to errors, losing my temper, etc."
Foodforthought,3c9we5,hedronist,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:55:07 2015 UTC,"What does it say on that tshirt? ;)   OK, but you asked for it! :-)  For starters it's sort of a dodecahedral T-shirt, so it depends on what side you're looking at.   I learned a lot of lessons from being depressed, but these are my lessons, so they may not apply well (or at all) to someone else's situation. And that is the first thing I learned: each person's depression has very personal roots to it, and that fact -- that reality -- has to be respected by anyone who truly wants to help. Depression is not just feeling ""a little down"" or ""sorry for yourself."" It is a fundamental change in your world view, and you have to approach it as such -- there are no overnight cures for it. This means you have to look at the long run ... which unfortunately is one of the classic problems with depression: you get into a ""tunnel vision"" state where all you can see is that this very moment sucks planetoids and things can never get any better. No one other than yourself can ""solve"" your depression. They can be helpful in various ways, but the damage is mostly coming from within, so that's where the repairs need to be made. Depression is often called a ""disease of the able,"" and I think that's true to a certain extent, but the truth is that anyone can become depressed. For me the single most valuable thing was to get out of doors. Get away from the dark room where my terminal glowed (glowered?) at me and out into the sunlight, into the community, into life. Unfortunately another common trait of depression is a total loss of initiative combined with a sense of overwhelming fatigue. This is where a true friend can do some good. My SO at the time got me to make a deal that we would take a walk -- in the neighborhood, or over on the Stanford campus, or in Foothills Park -- every day. To begin with these walks lasted about 5 minutes, but eventually we might be out for a couple of hours. It's 40 years later and I still am grateful for her help. Find something -- anything -- that you can do successfully, even if it's something as trivial as taking out the garbage. And when you've done that, acknowledge your success! The recognition that you succeeded at something is like lighting one, small candle in a completely dark cave. And then find something else you can succeed at ... and do it! The first few successes are like snowflakes falling on the top of a mountain range. But after a while you've got a lot of snowflakes, each one of which is proof that you can do something. And after a little while longer you have so many of these things that you can actually feel the forward momentum start to build in your life. Once you have some strength and some belief in yourself again, start to look around your environment for situations or people that feed your negative feelings about yourself. If it's a situation, change it or move away from it as soon as possible. If it's a person, you could try asking them to stop, but don't be surprised if they won't or can't. If that's the case, dump them! This may sound harsh, but we're talking about emotional and intellectual survival here -- maybe even physical survival -- and anyone who wants to Feed The Beast that is consuming you is not your friend! Let me repeat that: these people are not your friends. As you get stronger and stronger, make sure that your life is full of people and things that empower you. I'm not talking about someone feeding you saccharine praise all the time, but people who are honest with you. People who give you honest feedback. If it's critical feedback then they combine it with suggestions for improvement. And if it's positive, it's in recognition that you just climbed another 14er and that that was damn hard work.   One last very personal comment in this overly-long screed: drugs are a two-edged sword. They can be useful in really dire circumstances, but they can blunt your experience of the world, and that can lessen the value of the other things I mentioned.  The VA was feeding me serious doses of Elavil and Stelazne. The Stelazine was ""to break cyclic thought processes,"" (such as thinking about killing myself) except they didn't tell me that was how it worked.  The problem is I'm a programmer, and in order to do my job I have to apply recursive analysis to problems. I spent 9 months as a zombie until I finally found out why I couldn't think my way out of a wet paper bag ... Stelazine! And because I couldn't do my job, I felt more like a failure and got more depressed. It took about 2 months to fully wean myself from the Stelazine, but it made a world of difference.  Peace."

If we select for not disease why don't we select for x (eye color, needing vision correction, certain personalities or predispositions like sexuality, skin color). Why wouldn't we select for ""superior"" traits if we could?  I think it would instill a de facto ruling class immediately. And they're manufactured to be intelligent so normal people probably couldn't ""overthrow"" them. The rich would be the first (or the last) to have access to eugenics.   Also, who decides what to select for what traits? Slippery slope/conspiracy: the government/ruling class (wealthy) could possibly use this to control less desire able populations. Similarly, most abortions are in ethnic or economically disadvantaged populations.   I think that humans shouldn't be selected for before they are born. The ACA prohibits denying coverage based on a preexisting condition and I see it the same way towards eugenics.   I also believe that selecting for a certain type of individual could have enormous downsides, some that we currently won't be able to foresee. Would having all intellect focused individuals preclude art creation? Would having similar people selected for create a lack of genetic diversity?   I feel that at this point we can't control it or direct it in a way that is manageable and I could imagine the world becoming separated into five or so separate classes (art science government etc) like in divergent.    I also feel that it could/should be useless. Humans as a whole are smarter and better than before. Why don't we focus on helping the people that already exist to create a utopia rather than engineer super guys to solve our problems.   Looking back on the post I find it focuses too much on sci fi like GATTACA. Which is an awesome relevant movie to watch. The person you replied to did say he wanted intelligent savants though so that's what I focused on.   Disease eugenics may be different. Controlling for demobilization diseases could be good or bad depending on how you analyze it ethically. My personal opinion is that everyone should be given the chance at life if it's reasonable they'll survive and life won't be full of suffering.   Down's syndrome is a example of people that we should support in life rather than say they're better off dead. Another example: Fetal alcohol syndrome is the number one cause of mental retardation in the U.S. These are completely preventable cases that affect the children in different severity. The difference is it can go undetected until the child is having problems in grade school, where they can ""cap"" their learning ability.   Things like this lead me to believe that humanity should focus on making the best life/society for everyone, including those with disabilities. Counter argument: cost of care/providing for all disabled people, let alone average normal person. Yes it is obviously cost prohibitive, but does that mean we as a society shouldn't strive for this, and not even try?   Just my thoughts"

IVF fucking sucks; the article does not make a good case for people choosing it in preference to having babies the natural way.  Edit: The article quotes $12,000 per round of IVF, which we're sure as hell not going to spend on the poor."

Foodforthought,3cabe5,ineedmoresleep,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:31:34 2015 UTC,"I think it would instill a de facto ruling class immediately. And they're manufactured to be intelligent so normal people probably couldn't ""overthrow"" them. The rich would be the first (or the last) to have access to eugenics.   While intelligence potential can be genetic, it's not a guarantee. There are plenty of people that are intelligent, or have the potential to be very intelligent, that never get there for a variety of reasons. These include - but are not limited to - the person's interest in the subject, their actual drive to use it, how they use the intelligence, and how much the potential is actually nurtured.   I think that humans shouldn't be selected for before they are born. The ACA prohibits denying coverage based on a preexisting condition and I see it the same way towards eugenics.   Can you explain this further? From my point of view, it's not like life is being denied at all or life given where it normally wouldn't. It's just changing the genes of someone (hopefully!) for the better.   I also believe that selecting for a certain type of individual could have enormous downsides, some that we currently won't be able to foresee. Would having all intellect focused individuals preclude art creation?   I see this as assuming that every parent would select the same traits when I know of several parents that all have different aspirations for their child. Some want extremely creative individuals. Others want logical, intelligent individuals. Still, others want well-rounded children.    I also feel that it could/should be useless. Humans as a whole are smarter and better than before. Why don't we focus on helping the people that already exist to create a utopia rather than engineer super guys to solve our problems.   Why isn't it possible to do both at the same time? This is a false dilemma.  I see it this way - If or when eugenics becomes the norm, it's not like these genetic makeups are impossible to see in nature. And the life created isn't suddenly devalued just because their genetic traits were pre-selected. They are still alive, still human, and still may fall extremely short of their potential for any number of reasons."
Foodforthought,3cabe5,Dr_Karate,5,Mon Jul 6 20:57:17 2015 UTC,"There's a couple reasons: firstly, because it's been tried before in horrific fashion, and thus there's a strongly negative emotional attachment to the idea.  Secondly, because its impact on society is poorly understood - if some fraction of the population is significantly better than others at all kinds of jobs, what kind of social unrest might that cause?  Thirdly, we've only recently managed to make racism unpopular, and that's still not very well established (see for example large amounts of people who believe racism is wrong because of its factual incorrectness [i.e. there is no meaningful difference between people of different races in things like IQ; rather than accepting that there is a difference and it doesn't make them not people]). Would making it completely inarguable that some selection of people is better at everything shatter this semi-stable situation?  Fourth; it seems more likely eugenics would be implemented by discouraging a set of people from reproducing, rather than encouraging the most gifted ones. By definition the most successful people have the most sway in lobbying politics; if they don't want to have children, why would they support this idea? If they do want children, they don't need encouragement.  Designer babies are going to happen eventually (and will bring their own set of problems, like is a would-be parent allowed to decide to have children without such intervention, despite the negative impact it might have on the child?), and we should think about how to handle that problem; but eugenics has a bad rep for good reason."

Sort of like the way TV defines what language is considered ""vulgar"" in other media.  There's a point where TV is one of those things that everyone has access to and it starts to determine what's acceptable and what isn't.  If an insult or epithet starts to see more use on TV then people consider it less inappropriate overall.  Likewise, the meaning of some words may be functionally equivalent but if they are on the ""list"" of words you don't hear on TV, then they're given equal weight in other media or just in daily life.  Back to music, there's a point where classic rock (or ""alternative"" rock) becomes whatever the major broadcasting conglomerates decide it is through market research.  Sure, this shows how (like cultural mores) it is still connected to the general opinions of the public, but I can't help but think that there are loads more songs and bands that could just as easily fit under the label of ""rock that is classic"" than the usual 40 or 50 bands you're guaranteed to hear on ""Clear Channel Rock Station X"".

I'm sure that in a few years it'll be the music of the 80's and 90's and so on and so forth.  So far in my opinion this has led to a decline in quality. The period from roughly '65 to '72 was an amazing time for rock and roll. Because rock was still relatively new, the pace of innovation was incredible (and we can't match that pace today because so much of what rock can be has been explored at this point). So many of the greatest artists of all time were peaking together.  The mid to late seventies just didn't produce as much great rock, and the great rock that it did produce tended to be less mainstream. (Notice that the classic rock stations aren't playing much Patti Smith or Elvis Costello or Stooges or Clash, they're playing Boston and Styx and Kiss.) The period I mentioned before was noteworthy not just because it produced lots of great music, but because there was a lot of overlap between the best music and the most popular music (the Velvet Underground excepted).

I never said that all of rock and roll had been explored, or that there is no innovative music today, just that the pace has necessarily slowed. Obviously when something is new there's a lot more to discover and learn about it than there will be decades later.   I'm not trying to criticize the skill or creativity of today's artists by saying this. I'm just making the obvious point that it was a lot easier to write something that sounded completely new back then. Nowadays there are hundreds (possibly thousands) of documented sub genres of rock and roll. Creating something truly new and innovative is really difficult when there's that much existing rock and roll to compare your new work to. Chances are, somebody somewhere has recorded something that sounds like your new song. It'd be damn near impossible to create something that sounded as revolutionary to the modern listener as, say, 'Tomorrow Never Knows' sounded to listeners in 1966.  I'm not sure why you're arguing such a basic point, or why you have to strike such a condescending tone while doing so.  2.) The car comparison doesn't work at all. Music is an art form. It isn't necessarily made better by better technology the way that cars are. A great album can easily stand the test of time just like a great novel or a great film.  3.) First of all, the 70s birthed Metal, how dare you.  This is a taste thing, but metal really doesn't do anything for me. We could argue its merits but I don't think we'd get anywhere.  3.) ""Pink Floyd? Zeppelin? Judas Priest? Queen? I think all of them debuted AFTER '72.""  Thanks for proving my point. All four of these bands were formed in 1970 or earlier."

Most things, if not all things, are a product of a combination of things that came before them. With more products being combined with other products, more and more different kinds of music are born.   Of course it was easier back then, there wasn't nearly the breadth of choice we have today but if you could take literally anything from today back in time, you would completely BLOW someone's mind from '66. Can you imagine someone used to things like Mungo Jerry and then they listen to idk Jack White or Coheed?   Just thinking about what someone from 50 years ago would say to anything I listen to now, it only reinforces my opinion that innovation is only increasing more and more because it's more difficult to and because of the the availability that the internet provides.  I sound condescending about it I guess because it just sounded to me like you were making that ""classic rock is the best and new music sucks"" argument made by people that simply don't explore, it's pretty rage inducing to me.  I'd take a 69' Camaro over a '13 Camaro in a heart beat. haha   Oh definitely not gonna argue the merits or anything about metal, I'm not changing my mind on it and if you don't like it well I probably can't change yours, but it is what I grew up with and many of my favorite genres are under its umbrella. :P  Only mentioned those 4 off the top of my head that were popular in the 70s, Pink Floyd because most of their stuff was in the mid-late 70s. However! The late 70s brought in punk! And thrash! And speed metal! The 90s had the Deftones, which is by far one of my top 10 favorites at least and nothing really sounds like them. 2000s have the Black Keys and not many bands sound like them either. I could go on and on about the 4 decades after the 70s probably with more good/great/amazing artists than there were artists of any kind in the 60s and 70s. And then there's all the genres that aren't rock that I didn't mention."

While violent crime to everyone did go down with shall carry ( which as stated might not have anything to do with shall carry alone). Gun violence to gun owners remains far higher than non gun owners.   And here you see a massive gaping hole in this article. He feels safer with a gun when the exact opposite is true.   Ask any of the moms whose toddlers shot themselves with a found gun. Or any dad whose kid wandered in on a gun safe and accidentally shot a sibling how safe their guns make them feel.   The research scientifically proves a counter intuitive point that I have never seen a gun enthusiast believe or understand.

Because the only perspective you ever hear is the ""they're just in a tough situation!"" bit. How somehow everyone's working 2-3 full time jobs, has no car, and relies on food stamps. I'm sorry, but something doesn't add up. What it is is trying to find the most extreme case if misfortune and act like that's the norm for people on food stamps.  I worked in a industry where I was well aware of the benefits and jobs people had, and I saw more fraud or unnecessary benefits than I saw legitimate use. Not saying this is the same everywhere, but it happens. And yes, people are absolutely within their rights to be outraged that some citizens would rather mooch and do nothing."

It wasn't a matter of I just noticed the abusers, it was that I had to look at all the balances in order to do my job, so I know the whole score.  Of course there were people who used it legit. But consider that if you have 6 people use the system for 1-3 months, only taking what they need (you don't have to spend it all, and some people selflessly choose not to if they can help it), that's the same consumption as a single asshole with 3 kids and no job using it for a year.

I sometimes buy luxury food with that money, but it really doesn't matter if I pay for those items with my EBT card or my debit card- if I spend money on luxury food than I'll run out of benefit and spend my own money on necessities later in the month. I personally think the benefit amount is very reasonable where it currently is, as if you're frugal it will work out, but if you buy convenience foods or desserts you'll quickly run out. If you see people buying those sorts of foods with EBT it means they're going to be spending their own money later. The EBT benefit is definitely lower than what the average American individual/family spends monthly."

In this case, it's patently obvious that fracking has absolutely nothing to do with this.  For instance, if fracking fumes caused still-births - then, you would see a massive increase in infant-mortality for people in the natural gas industry.  But, you don't see that at all.  If fracking caused this, you'd also be seeing massive increases in infant-mortality within 10 miles of an active well.  But, again, you don't see this at all.  In this case, it's stupid to think that fracking's the cause.  Fracking's only getting bandied about as the cause due to ideology.  And, this wouldn't even be an issue if people weren't so lazy and actually did a bit of homework about the issue (in this case, you would find the EPA study they just released showing absolutely no ill-effects or water-poisonings from 70 years of widespread fracking).

One of the kids in the book, a Black teenager around 16 or 17, was interviewing for a job at a fast food restaurant, but was very stiff and distant and came across as rather unfriendly and even hostile to the interviewer, who was a young White woman.  When the author asked the boy why he didn't do things like shake her hand or smile much, he answered that he was afraid of frightening her or coming off as aggressive or threatening, and so he minimized contact.

The forceful suppression of leftist movements in islamic nations by the west has, in effect, said to those who live within those societies: ""if you're discontented, don't express your discontent in terms of the present economic order or we will crush you."" Western strategists have understood to begin with that we are entering the age of fifth generation warfare (composed of independent guerilla units operating in a mostly clandestine fashion, loosely organized ideologically rather than by a clear chain of command [taken from Thomas X Hammes book, *The Sling and the Stone]). If such warfare were anticapitalist in nature, anger would be limitless enough to actually threaten the imperialist presence in the area. Confining it to  religious extremism conveniently leaves out those citizens who are both discontented and reasonable - a sizeable chunk, perhaps a majority. Further, this creates a low-intensity conflict that can justify drawn-out warfare that gets many people rich.   In short, extremist islamism is a class warfare issue, by and large. Compassion is needed as much as solidarity in class struggle is needed.

But there is a clear and obvious connection between issues of class and fundamentalist Islamic terrorism.  And while that goes back to well before 9/11, the events of that day provide a clear example.  It would be easy enough to say that all of those Saudis who participated in the hijacking attacks were merely angry about infidels encroaching upon their holy land, but if you look at the economic situation in Saudi Arabia before 9/11... you'll see that the average income there dropped by roughly 66% in the decade prior.  And if you don't think economic matters like that factor into general animosity which can be presented in ways like Islamic fundamentalism, then I don't know what to tell you.    Now don't misunderstand... no one is saying that twisted fundamentalism doesn't play a role in fundamentalist terrorism.  However, it should be understood that fundamentalism is merely one way that people respond to various issues in their lives.  And you're often going to find that a lot of the biggest issues which people have to deal with are related to aspects of socioeconomic class.    If you don't think that the extreme stratification of economic classes is an issue, with billionaire's living opulent lives while other people suffer, toil, and starve... then I'd be curious to know what factor you think plays a bigger role social unrest.  Do you think that people are simply brainwashed by things like religion without any connection to their socioeconomic circumstances?   Like, I know that doing so is a central element of Marxist thinking but it always impresses me to see a person taking a look at ISIS and thinking ""now, how can I figure out how me and these people are really on the same side.""   I suppose that's one way of putting it, but another way of putting it would be... ""How can we figure out how to stop these people from wanting to kill us in our sleep.""

Jon Stewart had a tirade about this a few weeks ago. But something explains this is ideology. ISIS represents a counter vision of a world order that we really don't like. We really don't want to be run by theology and sharia law. Theoretically, in the back of our minds, there's always that thought that if ISIS grows strong enough they could raise enough support throughout the world and start a global war of religion, bringing war to our country or at least threatening the rest of the global order wherever muslims are. They are a threat to our identifying notion that democracy is the end of history, and the superior type of government.   But the guy who shot up the church was just a singular dickhole whose ideology was weak, and in our turf. We control his target audience. We are his audience. And it's easy for us to beat him with love because the people he is trying to incite are us. He didn't really have any ideology that would threaten our national identity. As much as he was a racist, he was probably still a democratic believer.    I don't know if this makes any sense, but the church shooter essentially lacks a competitive ideology to threaten the US global order. ISIS represents a competitive ideology that could threaten us, so we are more afraid of Islamic extremism. Hence the different policies."

It seems to be praised especially for its sociopolitical themes. I found that aspect of Dune entertaining but somewhat cartoonish. The gender and psychology parts read very 60s to me.  I don't see Dune as politically relevant. For one, isolated desert people just don't defeat commercial empires. For two, we don't have warring aristocratic houses. For three, Paul succeeds because he has been bred to be a magical messiah. It's purely fantasy, which is fine.

No, but the Taliban, Al Qaeda, ISIS, et al, do cause a lot of thorny problems in a region that produces the most important commercial commodity in the world.   Sure, but it's much more complex than in Dune. The Middle East isn't the only place with oil, and there's nothing so exceptional about its ecology or culture as on Arrakis. Controlling Arrakis is a trump card in galactic politics. Controlling a substantial segment of the middle east from outside wrecks your budget; from inside it leaves you trying to hold on to power while diversifying your economy. That is still highly simplified, but much more complex than Dune.    For two, we don't have warring aristocratic houses.   The big global conglomerate corporations are certainly ruthless in their own way. Some folks have pointed out that a lot of our recent foreign policy (including military action) centered on protecting corporate profits.   That has happened.

The Union committed serious atrocities for sure, but let's not forget the Cornerstone Speech. Here's a sample:    Many governments have been founded upon the principle of the subordination and serfdom of certain classes of the same race; such were and are in violation of the laws of nature. Our system commits no such violation of nature’s laws. With us, all of the white race, however high or low, rich or poor, are equal in the eye of the law. Not so with the negro. Subordination is his place. He, by nature, or by the curse against Canaan, is fitted for that condition which he occupies in our system. The architect, in the construction of buildings, lays the foundation with the proper material-the granite; then comes the brick or the marble. The substratum of our society is made of the material fitted by nature for it, and by experience we know that it is best, not only for the superior, but for the inferior race, that it should be so. It is, indeed, in conformity with the ordinance of the Creator. It is not for us to inquire into the wisdom of His ordinances, or to question them. For His own purposes, He has made one race to differ from another, as He has made “one star to differ from another star in glory.” The great objects of humanity are best attained when there is conformity to His laws and decrees, in the formation of governments as well as in all things else. Our confederacy is founded upon principles in strict conformity with these laws.   That speech was delivered by the Vice President of the Confederacy a few weeks before secession. So, while not everyone who flies it is racist, the confederacy was definitely about racism to begin with, regardless of the atrocities that came after.  What truly bothers me about it though is that the people who fly it try to ignore the component race played in the Civil War. They often are ignorant of the history and have no idea what I'm talking about when I mention the Cornerstone Speech, which is a pretty famous part of Civil War history. These being the same people who often talk about how people are ignorant and should know their history.  tl;dr I think the flag is a symptom of the culture of celebrating ignorance and conformity here in the south. Nobody who claims to do so is actually using it for the sake of 'heritage'."

I'd argue it's much easier to have a grip on history when your entire region isn't still stewing in it.  That said, there are plenty of Southern natives that do have an understanding of all this. The culture of the deep South is changing - the region is the fastest growing Hispanic population in the country, and many of my college peers are as liberal as anybody I've met in NYC (where I live now). It's simply not the bastion of white, conservative power it once was. And there's no reason that rend won't continue.

Foodforthought,3byx33,ButtsexEurope,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:07:39 2015 UTC,"For people whose loyalty was to the state first, and national government second, it absolutely felt like a War of Northern Aggression.   An invader will be met with opposition, and what Americans have no sense of in the modern day is just how little national identity meant when compared with state identity in the days when the nation was less than a century old.  To a Virginian whose state had more or less existed since 1607 (254 years by 1861), the idea that the Federal government (whose Constitution was only 74 years old) could tell them that they couldn't leave whenever they wanted to was absurd.   Just think about it: America won't be 254 years old until 2030.  The Declaration of Independence would never have been written or signed without Virginia (or the slave states) The Revolutionary War would never have been won without Virginia (or the slave states) The new Constitution would never have been ratified without Virginia (or the slave states). Some of the nation's greatest minds, generals, and leaders hailed from Virginia (or the slave states).  In their mind, and you are perfectly free to disagree, they were only demanding that the Union honor the terms of the deal their States signed up for. It's not like the Southern States were demanding anything more or less than what they were promised when they chose to join the Union. In modern terms it's akin to half the countries in the EU deciding to invade the other half and force them to accept much more invasive EU rule than they originally signed up for. Would that make the people of the countries who fought to keep their countries free from an EU takeover traitors?  You don't have to think the Civil War was fought over states rights, but I'm telling you that your failure to understand why it's called the War of Northern Aggression is almost certainly related to an inability to understand the mindset of a Virginian in 1861."

The Confederate Constitution made no allowance for secession by its members. It didn't allow the individual states to make up their own mind regarding slavery, as it expressly forbid the passing of laws which would make slavey illegal.

But we can't relieve men with guns of the responsibility for what they do because of some mistaken notion that they are stupid.  A soldier in the South knew that the reason the war was being waged was because of slavery. Those soldiers saw enslaved people in their states throughout entire lives. They knew that if they didn't fight, the only significant difference in their lives would be that the slaves around them would be set free.   Sure, maybe they didn't like the idea of outsiders forcing their will on them, but that would be a laughably ironic position to hold when one is fighting in the defense of slavery.

We found exactly the opposite: whites with more knowledge about Civil War history are actually less supportive of the state flag prominently featuring the Confederate battle emblem   Also, all these ""more"" or ""less""s are entirely relative to other Georgians.

And the reason for choosing a battle flag was because the south, inspired by such classics as Birth of a Nation, decided that their fight was a just one, slavery and all. They also revived the KKK, just in case anyone was confused about their true motivations.   The other big moment in the flag's life, was integration.   Prior to the information age, for many white northerners, it was easy to mistake the flag as a generic tag for Southern folk. The Dukes of Hazard certainly helped. So did some really incredibly lazy Civil War historical studies. But really, the entire time, it was helping certain vested interests get free propaganda, while simultaneously flipping a lot of black folks the bird.

As a historical example: For much of the English Renaissance, students were taught rhetoric through Erasmus's De Utraque Verborum ac Rerum Copia (roughly, ""Of Copious Speech""). It offered, among other things, 195 separate versions of the sentence ""Your letter pleased me greatly.""   Seems excessive, doesn't it?  But that's precisely the point. We spend our days talking to different people – friends, bosses, clerks, children, customers, strangers, co-workers, angels, students, enemies – and all us, even ""former Google execs,"" have to fine-tune our speech to any number of self-apparent and not-so-self-apparent social rules. If you don't play by those rules, or if you don't know them, you lose. You alienate people, or miss promotions, or annoy customers, or get arrested.  And ""just"" is a really, really useful tool in that game. (I like how you put it: ""A calculated appearance of being uncertain goes a long way."" So true! The article does precisely that, if you go back and re-read it.) It's useful precisely because it is able to do the things she vilifies: it asks permission, it offers an apology, it communicates shyness rather than boldness. And that's a useful to have, even if you are at the top of your respective corporate pyramid. It's like cocaine: Sure, some people may abuse it, but it's really fucking great to have in your back pocket if you need it. So why cut it out entirely? That's just bullshit.

They  get really defensive because they think it makes them sound stupid that they didn't just restart the computer. Goddammit I really wish trivializing people's problems or solutions made them feel at ease instead of defensive. You don't understand how lucky you are.   Even with that, though, if I just say ""oh, you need to restart the computer"", I am having a hard time understanding why that would be so forgettable compared to adding a ""just"" in there. ""you need to do x"" ""you just need to do x"" seem identical to me."

Foodforthought,3bv7de,ricksteer_p333,21,Thu Jul 2 14:32:27 2015 UTC,"Just so you know there are other uses for 'just' than just that one phrase. If you just finished school for instance, you would be justified in saying that you were just entering the workforce. You can also use 'just' as a means of indicating a very small amount like, say, indicating that you met your goal just shy of the projected target and have inexperience as a justification. There is harsh justice in the business world and sometimes people feel just al little too conscious about their own use of words in formal speech and writing where the only thing they need is just a little more experience to get it just right. I will concede that the juxtaposition of the right amount of 'just' versus an annoying amount of 'just' is an exercise that you just can't get when you don't experiment with language enough to get a good feel for it. You could say that whatever a justice decides is just just because that's what their line of work is, but that just doesn't sit right and everybody who reads enough language knows there are just enough connotations to just that it might seem as if you're just using it too much versus getting it just right.

There is literally ZERO evidence that there is any sort of systematic bias keeping women out of companies like apple.  The reality you seem to be missing is that Apple has a 70/30 male to female split while only 18% of comp sci graduates are women and 19% of engineering graduates are women. In other words, women are actually over-represented relative to the applicant pool... Get out of here with that false-feminism shit and try to be a little more objective about these kinds of things.

Foodforthought,3bv7de,upleft,-1,Fri Jul 3 03:47:04 2015 UTC,"You're right. I'm sure there are a number of roles within the company that do not require comp-sci or engineering degrees.   However, the reality is these are tech companies. It seems pretty fair to assume the vast majority of jobs are comp-sci and engineering based.   If you're going to hold the belief that these companies are sexist and keeping out women just because they're women, you need to provide some evidence. The burden of proof is always on the one making the claim.   The only evidence that is ever really provided by those who make the whole ""Silicon Valley is sexist"" argument is that there are more men than women. Pointing out the fact that men receive education relevant to this kind of work at a 4:1 ratio discredits that argument pretty heavily.  Personally, I'm all for women entering STEM, but I don't think making up excuses is the way to go about it. It needs to start way earlier than the workplace. We need to let girls know when they're still young that they can and should pursue these fields. Telling them the playing field is stacked against them only scares them away."

Foodforthought,3by069,BlankVerse,7,Fri Jul 3 02:21:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's on track but missed a few benefits of monarchy.  For one thing, monarchs are by nature independent, they don't need to run, thus they're not influenced by the money that lobbying provides for elections.  That means that a strong monarchy is a check on the power of corporate interests-- they're not for sale because they don't need anything.  The Koch brothers can buy Obama because he has to run for office, they can't buy QEII because she is ruler by birth.  Monarchy invites a long term view.  QEII has been queen for decades, and she expects to pass on the throne to Charles.  She has to look long term, because anything she kicks down the road, she or her heirs have to deal with.  There's no ""let the next guy deal with it"" it's her problem.  That helps in dealing with problems with unpopular fixes that need to be dealt with to prevent long term issues.    A lot of social issues will go back to being private.  Not that official policy won't prevent bigotry, but that outside of the people directly responsible for policy, it's not something that the rest of us need to be propagandize about or asked about.  I can privately hold my opinion because private life choices that don't harm anyone shouldn't be political footballs.  By not putting such things under popular votes, it's not a huge acrimonious debate, it's simply officially we're doing this, and if you work in the public sphere, you follow policy.  You don't have to like it, and private groups can ignore it, and now both sides can either come together or go to separate corners."

In that context, it's more about social signaling (hey look, I'm progressive and totally not a bigot) which at the moment is trendy and in general good for your prospects in business and politics, than it's about actually supporting actual gay people.  If it were about support for gay people, where were you 5 years ago?  Where are you on the other issues?  When was the last time you spoke in defense of gay people or called out a gay joke?  If you weren't there when embracing the rainbow was unpopular and dangerous, then don't pretend that you have a right to it when it's the popular and correct thing to do.    It's really insulting.

Fascism is a resistance to this, even if it is a profound, irrational, demented resistance[.]   That is to say, modernity is in part a project of breaking down grand ideologies and mystical worldviews which used to provide a sense of belonging and purpose. In return it offers us lots and lots of things, but as the old saying goes, man cannot live on bread alone and so he goes searching for something, anything to convince himself that life is more than the smallness of shopping and holding down a boring job. Fascism and ISIS offer to fill that void with a fantasy project of grandiose, apocalyptic significance - in particular, something to die in service of - within what amounts to an alternate universe that its devotees collectively imagine they inhabit."

What modernity does not do, the Marxist in me must insist, is rob human beings of their sense of belonging, value, and purpose.  If your senses of belonging, value, and purpose were grounded in phantoms, or can only be grounded in phantoms, then that's not a problem with modernity, that's a problem with you.  Or, if you think that modern life necessarily consists in ""the smallness of shopping and holding down a boring job"", the problem may well be (ie: usually is) with capitalism.  You are allowed to belong to things, to feel intensely, to hold convictions, to act boldly, and to strive for causes in real life.  You are ""allowed"" in the sense that these things all actually exist, unlike, for instance, gods, master races, ubermenschen, and apocalyptic battles.  What exists already existed before you found out about it, and what never existed was nonexistent before you found out that too, so you might as well just learn to live in real life."
Foodforthought,3bm77w,eaturbrainz,9,Tue Jun 30 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"Some people can subsist on a reasoned existence that they design and diagram for themselves after careful reflection. Some of these will talk of ""following your bliss"" and being ""self-made"" or ""self-actualized.""  It takes a very particular, even peculiar sort of education to do this, to even want to do this. To invent your own life for yourself. To do what for many sons and daughters would seem like reinventing the wheel. My dad is a carpenter. I know carpentry.    It's a relatively new approach to life as far as history is concerned. It was conceived in Western Europe and gestated in the American Athens' of Boston and Philadelphia, and from there it has spread out to the world gradually, fitfully.  In interviews while he was making ""Ride With the Devil,"" about the end of the Civil War, Ang Lee called the slow promulgation of these ideas the ""Yankee Invasion."" He points out that in much (most?) of the world people are simply unprepared to build their own destiny, their own meaning of life from the ground up.    'I started to think about ""What is this Yankee invasion?"" I found my characters talking about Yankees the way the rest of the world talks about Americans. Such an imperialism prevails, you lose your cultural roots, everyone becomes more Americanised. This Yankee invasion has to be not only the military kicking butt, but changes from inside. It's the promise of freedom and equality that really makes it unstoppable. It starts with the Civil War, but it's really about the start of the new civil order for the whole world.'  Now, personally, I believe this is the type of approach to life that is the most fair and the best for most people, but then I would, wouldn't I? I'm a product of it.  Some people, I would even say most people, even most Americans, are wired up differently from this. They have different expectations for how they figure out their role in the universe. These people can only flourish with a very strong myth to provide an identity, an ethos, a value system, a narrative.  These folks will tend to think about things in a broader, more  archetypal sort of mental language. They will find their future in an anthem or chant more than a kind of personal calculus.   I would disagree with you that this is wrong of them. It's not a fault. It's human nature, and the tendency is an effective condensation; like an MP3 is a compression of a music file. It's effective and saves memory and processor space. People will use it.  The myths have value.  Not everyone has the time or the inclination to be a philosopher citizen like Thomas Jefferson. But lots of people can think of George Washington telling the truth about chopping down the cherry tree, and aspire to be like that. And to defend the same flag as Washington.  What you and I must do, to promote our vision of what a free, healthy human looks like is to provide an appealing myth that people will want to sign up for.  We must encourage people to see freedom, modernity, democracy, egalitarianism as worthy causes, so they will share with us the conviction that they are worth fighting for.  To the extent that we and our friends fail to do this, other mythmakers will find people assembling under their flags.    Flags are hot right now. A controversial one was just removed, by community decision, from a place of mythological importance near where I live in the US. Luckily people had another one, arguably a more inclusive one, with red white and blue arranged in subtly but significanttly different was, to replace it. They will look out their windos now and see that one above our state house now.  I will celebrate this as the better myth winning. (Again. as many times as we have to.)  There is more to say about how the more archaic viewpoint will get hung up on capitalism, but I am out of time.  I will say that regulated capitalism is the best the world has done yet at producing a meritocracy, yet protecting those of lesser ""utility."" In my opinion."

You know that's an appeal for certain kinds of fans. They want to go there.   Some would stab a goblin in the throat in a second if they had half a chance! Modern politics be damned. Stabbing orcs is right because orcs are the enemy! For the Free People! For Frodo! Stabby stabby stab!  Again, I prefer people who get excited about dressing as elves, over putting on an actual uniform and actually drinking some cult Kool-aid and killing innocents. I know there's a difference of course! Just pointing out that there is a similarity between what Baudrillard said fascism offers, and what is offered by a fiction which romanticizes a medieval mindset. My king = good; your king = demonic.  (edit: obviously it is on a totally different scale. One asks a literary / metaphorical investment and the other demands a blood payment.)"
Foodforthought,3bm77w,phenomenomnom,7,Tue Jun 30 17:41:27 2015 UTC,"This essay is a lot of words to say something pretty basic. The world is a complicated place that's hard for an individual to wrap their head around. Groups/people that offer an illusion of simplicity and certainty will always have an innate appeal to some individuals who feel like they can't find their ""path"" through life.   If you're looking for that sort of certainty, ISIS provides it. They claim to know exactly how man is supposed to live, they claim that those directions are very specific and come from God. And they perform a lot of very severe acts in pursuit of that perfect lifestyle, so they're obviously very serious and very committed."
Foodforthought,3bm77w,shawnaroo,3,Tue Jun 30 17:38:46 2015 UTC,"This essay is a lot of words to say something pretty basic.   Have you even read it? It lists a lot of metaphors that the ISIS cause has in common with well-known myths and legends, and the fiction of Tolkien. It goes into detail about why people find certain ideas appealing and shows how ISIS uses them.   TLDR; Captain America is King Arthur and so is Jesus."
Foodforthought,3bm77w,SandyRegolith,2,Tue Jun 30 21:29:38 2015 UTC,Yes. I did read it. And all of that can basically be summed up as ISIS present a relatively simple stark black and white view of the world that appeals to people who feel lost and confused in modern society.   And a lot of fiction works similarly.
Foodforthought,3bm77w,shawnaroo,3,Tue Jun 30 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"It really is more complicated than that, be fair. It's a simple worldview, yes, but which one, and why does it appeal to certain types of people?  Lots of things can be summed up in one sentence (cf. Monty Python and the works of Proust) but that doesn't mean there's nothing there of any value."
Foodforthought,3bm77w,SandyRegolith,2,Tue Jun 30 23:13:47 2015 UTC,"This article does say surprisingly little about ISIS, but there is more than enough information on their beliefs and atrocities in other places. I feel the point of this article is not to cast an exotic flair on ISIS, the focus of many other articles, but to demonstrate that the reactionary and fantastical ambitions that drive them are not alien to western culture. From the anticipated second coming of christ to King Arthur, we in the west are not strangers to this kind of thinking. I think this article demonstrates well that if we wish to understand why people could be so crazy all we have to do is look around at our own dissatisfied lives and the small myths and fantasies that save us from existential anguish.   Just thinking about the American attitude after 9/11 when Americans were called to fight a righteous war under a good christian president against a heathen despot makes me feel that this sentiment is closer to the American spirit than we might want to admit.   But of course the lessons of modernity reveal to us that these pipe dreams are just that. One day it's ""Mission Accomplished"" and the next ISIS is beheading people in the twisted scar we left behind. The machine of industrialized capitalism is stronger than any reactionary wishes to imagine and the wheels of progress are oiled with the blood of those crushed beneath them."

Foodforthought,3boefq,jim_cricket,0,Wed Jul 1 03:42:30 2015 UTC,"The scenarios described in this article are mostly simple supply/demand economics.   London estate agents have invented something called a “client progression fee”   London is arguably the most desirable real estate in the world right now, so demand is high, and supply is limited. This is a classic ""seller's market"",  and people are willing to pay this fee, so it gets charged. A real estate agent in Wichita, Kansas doesn't charge this fee, because demand is lower and buyers won't pay it.  The same goes for all the ""convenience fees"" that people constantly gripe about. If a ticket is $100 and the additional fees are $20, then the price of the ticket is $120. A customer is either willing to pay it or they're not. As long as venues continue to sell out, the price will continue to be charged. In fact, it should go up, to $130, $150 and higher, until there aren't enough people willing to pay to fill the seats.  Except for some mention of medical care later in the article, the scenarios described are voluntary transactions between two parties. The buyer trying to maximize their profit is not ""fracketeering"" or any other nefarious scheme. If the price is too high, if the fee is to exhorbitant, just walk a way."

It may be OK for this girl, who is paying her way through law school, but not for this girl, who was molested as a child, who never knew she had another choice, who was just trying to get money to eat.    That's missing the point.  The goal of decriminalization is to remove marginalization.  If prostitution is legal, a sex worker would have no problem going to the police, or setting up safe working conditions in the first place.  It benefits both the willing sex workers, and those who are unwilling, by enabling the former to work in safer conditions, and the latter to get the hell out."

Were those bad words and old slanders being bandied around as a kind of satire, demystifying ingrained prejudices, or were they the sharp points at the edge of free speech, a way of insisting that no idea could be off limits? No one was quite sure, perhaps not even the trolls.   Is the key point here. What initially was probably only, and undoubtedly still is for many, a convoluted mess of sarcasm and mocking of ideas isn't necessarily distinguishable from the serious statements any more. 'I can't tell who's trolling' is kind of the goal, and that's often where the humour and the most cutting critiques lie.    4chan, insofar as anyone can speak for its anonymous, double-talking membership, has long maintained that much of its racism is really just performance designed to rattle the mainstream.   But that can also normalise those kind of ideas and speech for those who aren't necessarily 'in' on the joke or don't view it as such, ala:   “I came here and just lurked for months. I was astonished at all these terrible racists but they kept referring to things I had no idea about (black on white crime, Zionists, WW2, etc.)…long story short you destroyed my perception of the world.”   Now I think that a lot of it simply isn't a joke any more. Indeed, as the author of this article details, it is very much deliberate and serious discussion by people like Anglin - targeted and encouraged by them because it allows the normalisation of that kind of discussion.

Foodforthought,3bhx41,Pyrolytic,2,Tue Jun 30 14:23:04 2015 UTC,"Well that quote is from the article, which is a screen grab of a /pol user who has ostensibly been drawn towards white nationalism by the board (quite a deliberate strategy on behalf of people like Anglin).  I think this illustrates the point that racism and anti-Semitism can be normalised for some people by constant jokes. I use these jokes with my mates - e.g. jews did wtc - but we are firmly aware that these are ludicrous concepts and it's used only for shock value and highlighting the idiocy of those who do believe it. And that's the 4chan/anonymous mantra, or at least it used to be, that the shock humour and risqué concepts served as a kind of cutting social commentary. But actually it's kind of evolved from that, and been deliberately hijacked by people who take it very literally.   As to whether those are useful topics for discussion, i'm not sure. They're not really actually discussed much on reddit/4chan/whatever. At least not in the context that this article is talking about - the small polarised boards which provide a haven for the white nationalist view on those issues. You'll get good discussion on something like /r/AskHistorians or even here about those issues... but on /r/conspiracy and other echo-chambers like it? Nah.   I don't have a solution - I am as guilty as others of staying within my own echo chamber. But that's not really the point of this article, the discussion per se. It's more a good illustration of how reddit/4chan can be used to recruit and sway people to extremist views - and normalisation of those views plays a key role I think."
Foodforthought,3bhx41,Chief_White_Halfoat5,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:54:45 2015 UTC,"I found your summary more interesting than the original article, so bravo!  I think the real importance of places like 4chan and the grimy parts of reddit is as a reminder of the fear of thought police.  We can't say whatever we want in most public places, and the physical echo chambers of the past are few and far between.  Look at the outrage at a rape joke told by a comedian, because somehow offending someone is nearly a crime.  There has always been an undercurrent of dissent, as long as humanity has been able to document itself.  This will always be exploited by those looking to further their cause, and singling out the flavor of the week website is no more of a solution than using spies was during the Cold War.  The Internet is as close as any person can get to seeing into my brain.  My biggest fear is we take away rights out of fear, and that hasn't changed at all in the Internet age.  What you never get back is the safe place for the ideas, discussions, and critiques the author wrote about discovering on 4chan, and the people who thrive in those places suffer.  There is a gray area between thinking about a crime and committing it, and it feels troubling to know that you can't stop it from happening.  If you accept that terrible things will happen, the spread of hateful ideas is not something you fear.  When you can't accept that, you will destroy everything in your path."

Foodforthought,3bho9w,omfalos,3,Tue Jun 30 02:21:23 2015 UTC,"I found this piece to be poorly argued, the author doesn't really consider counter-arguments, and doesn't do enough to show a causal relationship between marriage and the huge number of social ills he has connected it to.   I think I'll go through it piece by piece.   Marriage is a tool of anti-Black racism.   The historic part of this seems fairly accurate, but the author doesn't really acknowledge that the issue at the heart of the 'family crisis' in black communities is more one of broken homes/ single parenthood than it is one of loving couples choosing not to get married. I agree that government policies trying to encourage marriage aren't really fixing the problem, but this doesn't show that black couples marrying is counterproductive.   Marriage is a tool of colonialism   Very little of this section has anything to do with marriage, and the author does nothing to link historic issues around colonialism with marriage in the present day.   The US encouraged westward settlement by promising male settlers 160 acres to move west, plus an extra 160 if they married and brought a wife.    Don't see how it is fair to blame marriage for this. The issue was dispossession and sending families out west was a good way to populate new areas.    Marriage has been one of the key valves of that control. The Page Act of 1875, for example, sought to keep out Asian women, hoping to prevent Asian laborers in the US from reproducing, but allowed the immigration of Asian merchants’ wives.    This actually seems to rebut the author's argument. Asian migrants were denied a foothold in the US because they were not provided with opportunities to marry and establish a family.    Marriage has always been about who is whose property (women, slaves, children) and who gets what property. Inheritance, employee benefits, insurance claims, taxation, wrongful death claims--all of the benefits associated with marriage are benefits that keep wealth in the hands of the wealthy.    A lot of these exist independent of marriage, and were it abolished today I doubt that wealthy families would suddenly find it any more difficult to keep their wealth concentrated.  Why should anyone have to get married to get health care or immigration status?   Because marriage is a fairly easy way to establish a long term relationship, and it is generally agreed that keeping couples separate is cruel? Maybe you could argue that these benefits should be extended to de facto couples as well, but does the author really believe we should not give prefererential migration status to those who are separated from their loved ones? Why is this a problem with marriage when the same rules apply to family members?  That would mean putting resources toward real solutions to these problems---the struggles against immigration enforcement and for health care access for all   Marriage is part of a system where the government chooses some relationships, family structures and sexual behaviors as the gold standard and rewards them, while others are stigmatized and/or criminalized.    Here he needs to be more specific. Which relationships are stigmatized/ criminalized? Is he talking about paedophilia, (the only one I can think of that is expicitly criminalised) polygamy? Could the argument not be to bring constructive relationship structures into the fold of government support rather than deny that support to everyone?   We are told that people, but especially women, have empty, useless lives unless they are married.    Again, I feel that this would far better be solved by increasing our acceptance of other relationship dynamics rather than attacking those who do wish to get married.    In this equation, women are valued only for conforming to racist and sexist body norms and men are also objectified and ranked according to wealth   A very one note depiction of marriage. What about the enormous number of couples that marry for reasons other than these three? Does the author have any data to show marriages are primarily organised along these lines?    But the system of marriage is not about the government wanting to recognize people’s love and support it—it is about controlling people and resources   How does the government control resources through marriage? What about the other, less sinister benefits that the government/ society gain from two adults cooperating, cohabiting, and staying together to produce stable and well supported offspring? Why does being progressive mean that we have to ignore the very real benefits brought about by these things?    There are big fights going on to stop immigration enforcement expansion, end border militarization, detention and deportation and stop health care profiteers from bleeding us all dry. Unfortunately, the biggest, richest gay organizations have not put those fights at the center--even though they are the real pathways to addressing queer and trans immigration and health care problems--because they’ve poured almost everything into marriage   I think that this either/or is a bit absurd. If gay organisations focused on ending border militarization they would likely achieve little or nothing. Marriage equality was a fight that could actually be won.   But what you want is unwinnable—we need to take incremental steps and this is an incremental step towards equality. This is a heartbreakingly conservative argument that says there is no alternative to neoliberalism, to capitalism, to a culture based on racist criminalization and imprisonment.    Guess this comes down to personal preference, but incremental steps are how the bulk of what is good about modern society came about.  The author can think big if they want, but I have yet to hear any even slightly realistic plan for how popular protest from a small minority has any chance of bringing down neoliberalism/ capitalism."

As someone currently living in the South, I find that almost nobody is actively racist--in fact most are appalled by the concept.  However, they also do not realize that their own political inclinations are (in)directly caused by the systematic racism in law.  Just my two cents"
Foodforthought,3bicyg,Quouar,2,Mon Jun 29 13:48:29 2015 UTC,"I keep reading articles like this in hopes that I can change my own opinion on churches like this. To me they seem bigoted, outdated and I have yet to find someone tell me how nitpicking phrases in the bible that don't translate well in our time can be a moral way of living life. From what I've read of Jesus, the dude seemed like he would be completely OK with any kind of marriage as long as God is at the center of it.   It seems like as an Evangelical church that wants to attract more members, it would make more sense to be changing with the times, not further isolating potential members."
