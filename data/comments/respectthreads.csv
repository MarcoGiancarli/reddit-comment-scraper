Nayru's love lasts a little less than a minute. I believe around 60 seconds per use.That makes it the longest lasting magic fueled defensive ability out of all Links.  You also missed the Great Fairy of Courage's Blessing which halves damage.  You forgot to mention the hover boots reduce Link's traction.  The Ice Arrows actually deal the most damage out of all arrow types. It deals damage from both the arrow and freezing the enemy. It's a shame you can only get them near the end of the game.

respectthreads,3dkp2w,_-AJ-_,4,Fri Jul 17 03:11:15 2015 UTC,Don't watch the movies then. :D
respectthreads,3dkp2w,DO_NOT_EAT,2,Fri Jul 17 10:59:03 2015 UTC,"What does it mean to be a ""Chosen One""?  I havent seen the movies because horror films scare the shit out of me, but I'm liking what I see in the DC universe."
respectthreads,3dkh7s,Gutzahn,7,Fri Jul 17 00:18:12 2015 UTC,"First time doing this. There is a lot more to be said about Tattletale, but I hope this covers the different categories of her feats roughly. If you have additions or criticism let's hear it. I'll add some stuff I have in mind (regarding equipment, defusing traps etc) once I find the corresponding quotes again."
respectthreads,3dkh7s,bigdickpuncher,6,Fri Jul 17 00:21:08 2015 UTC,Great job on the thread. The only suggestion I could think of was to maybe highlight her ability to determine people's powers and weaknesses. This is especially important in the Wormverse where people trigger and get powers and often times have no idea what their capabilities/weaknesses are. Throughout the story in every major fight it was of key importance to find these things out so they could properly strategize.
respectthreads,3dkh7s,Chimerasame,3,Fri Jul 17 04:05:01 2015 UTC,"Great job! I love Tattletale so much. One of the more heartbreaking moments of Worm for me was when it was revealed that she was pushing herself into bad-migraine-level pain on purpose just by arranging every major connection on the wall, conspiracy-theorist style, and letting her power work on it, for the greater good of Skitter, the Undersiders, the world, etc."
respectthreads,3dkh7s,WAAAGH_intern,2,Fri Jul 17 13:07:31 2015 UTC,"Fantastic RT. I forgot how fun it was to read about tattletale do what she does best, definitely a good example of an interesting Worm powerset."
respectthreads,3dkgq1,Meskoot,2,Fri Jul 17 00:13:53 2015 UTC,"This is awesome. I grew up a Freddy fan, and for some reason didn't realize this comic actually existed. I'll definitely have to read it now."
respectthreads,3dkgq1,BigFudge117,2,Fri Jul 17 13:43:47 2015 UTC,"Its a pretty good read and its only 12 issues with both volumes together, so you get through it in 1-1:30 hours, its a much better follow up to the Freddy story than the last nigthmare or the remake was."
respectthreads,3dk762,Meskoot,5,Thu Jul 16 22:54:07 2015 UTC,Is the 2 Freddy vs Ash vs Jason comics the only Army of Darkness ones to be DC?
respectthreads,3dk762,FatiguedWalri,5,Thu Jul 16 23:00:24 2015 UTC,"They were published under the WildStorm banner, before it was merged into the main DC continuity.   Other Army of Darkness comics were published by Dynamite Entertainment most often ,with one or two Dark Horse publications."
respectthreads,3dk762,FatiguedWalri,5,Thu Jul 16 23:10:09 2015 UTC,Yeah Im own almost every single Dynamite one besides like 8. So......... since Midnighter got put in does this mean Ash and the others are on Earth 0?
respectthreads,3dk762,tomorrow2day,4,Thu Jul 16 23:13:14 2015 UTC,"Since DC doesn't own any of the franchises to my knowledge I doubt they carried the characters over (unfortunately, it could make for some fun crossovers. Grundy vs. Jason, Scarecrow vs. Freddy etc.).  I think it was only published under the WildStorm banner at the time, because DC didn't want hyper violence/rape/incest associated with their main publisher, these comics take place in the movieverse separate from the other WildStorm titles."
respectthreads,3dkcz6,Pokedexed,10,Thu Jul 16 23:42:06 2015 UTC,This is more like a slightly detailed summary of the character than a respect thread.
respectthreads,3dkcz6,Kejsare102,3,Fri Jul 17 00:20:40 2015 UTC,Some of these aren't even feats.
respectthreads,3dkcz6,Guntotingpotato,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:14:43 2015 UTC,"yeah, there aren't much I could really consider as feats during her cameos and her first solo runs"
respectthreads,3dkcz6,Guntotingpotato,3,Fri Jul 17 00:16:44 2015 UTC,Then why bother making it?
respectthreads,3dkcz6,ChocolateRage,5,Fri Jul 17 00:17:36 2015 UTC,"Was on the thread and decided to do one for her, and hoping that her run on solo was decent. This post has also been delayed since february (the run just ended with only 5 issues and then ANOTHER #1 this fall), got a message from admin if i was still doing it so i did."
respectthreads,3dkcz6,ChocolateRage,2,Fri Jul 17 00:20:44 2015 UTC,"To anyone wondering it is fine to post a respect thread early on, there obviously isn't a lot about this character because she's so new but it can and will be updated when the time comes.    As an aside, I appreciate the citation to issues, but I think adding the writer, artist, and colorist is unnecessary clutter.    I like the formatting though and thanks for posting so it's one less thing I have to add to the new list haha"

respectthreads,3dj3rh,TheLonelyPillow,6,Thu Jul 16 21:31:40 2015 UTC,Fun Fact:  Johnny himself was a herald of Galactus for a bit.  He also happened to have Sue's powers at the time.
respectthreads,3dj3rh,TheLonelyPillow,3,Thu Jul 16 21:47:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was aware, thanks for the cool scan btw."
respectthreads,3dj3rh,Captain-Turtle,3,Thu Jul 16 21:48:22 2015 UTC,"yesssssssss, I was gonna ask for this guy in the next weekly discussion, HT seems awesome, lets read dis  edit: read it, damn he's so much stronger than I thought, I only watched him in the most recent FF cartoon and he was literally useless almost every episode in terms of fire power"
respectthreads,3dj3rh,Captain_Excellent,2,Thu Jul 16 23:57:38 2015 UTC,"Is there any explanation for his exceptional durability? Torch seems like he should be a total glass cannon. Of course, with the kind of stuff the FF runs into I guess he sort of NEEDS to be more durable than a regular human otherwise he'd have died a long time ago.  Also, melting the bullets before they hit him wouldn't stop the momentum of the molecules. He'd just be hit by a cloud of superheated metal going at supersonic speeds, which would probably be even worse than getting hit by a bullet, despite being unaffected by the heat. But I guess I'll let that slide.  Great respect thread though."
respectthreads,3dj3rh,Captain-Turtle,5,Thu Jul 16 20:58:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why he's so tough actually.  In the early Fantastic Four issues he was a major glass cannon and getting hit by pretty much anything would cause him to flame off. But as time went on he just started getting more and more durable.  He even has a some pretty good durability feats while flamed off, but I chose not too include those."
respectthreads,3dj3rh,Captain-Turtle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:20:00 2015 UTC,why?
respectthreads,3dj3rh,bitlington,2,Fri Jul 17 05:54:53 2015 UTC,"I just figured they weren't as relevant as his durability while flamed on.  Also his durability feats while flamed off are kind of inconsistent, so if I just put all his good ones in I might be misrepresenting him a bit."
respectthreads,3dj3rh,Captain-Turtle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:05:18 2015 UTC,"I see, but they could be helpful in battles where someone can take his flame off"
respectthreads,3dj3rh,Captain-Turtle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:08:47 2015 UTC,"I guess I could add a couple in. I didn't save any though, so it may take me a bit to find them."

respectthreads,3df33g,Siddny-,2,Wed Jul 15 21:56:15 2015 UTC,Someone was talking about Jackie and said that he had a feat which involved creation on a huge scale.  Is this true?
respectthreads,3df33g,Domthecreator14,3,Wed Jul 15 21:29:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a city that the Darkness creates and Jackie absorbs it. Another instance is him 'creating' his own universe. Decent scan of him saying it."
respectthreads,3df33g,Intanjible,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:40:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not crazy about the name. There are too many synonyms for darkness and too many good writers and artists attached to this character that naming him ""The Darkness"" feels like one of them just consulted his edgy fourteen year old nephew."
respectthreads,3df33g,Intanjible,2,Wed Jul 15 19:47:05 2015 UTC,Jackie's name isn't The Darkness. The Darkness is the power he controls.
respectthreads,3df33g,Gboy4496,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:44:28 2015 UTC,"Well then the power should have a better name than ""The Darkness""."
