Running tutorials on calculus (including basic analysis, multivariable, and vector), linear algebra, number theory etc while doing my PhD meant that I HAD to be up on those subjects in order to be able to teach them/help from multiple angles to struggling students.  Teaching A-levels means that your understanding of the fundamentals of advanced pure/applied maths are challenged almost daily, especially with things like conditional probability and statistical hypothesis testing.  The bottom line is to try to explain it to somebody else (ideally someone who is knowledgeable themselves but might not necessarily know the topic you're talking about), as this forces you to coherently articulate your thoughts."

I have no formal teaching quals, but that doesn't matter in a country like Thailand.   I actually had never seen prime factorization before that and prior to that I can't ever recall applying LCMs and HCFs to practical problems. And I had done some university level calculus and lin algebra at that point.   It forced me to brush up on my understanding of radicals, and later on quadratics and polynomials. And being required to teach something really makes you think about it from different angles. Just constructing word problems did a lot to reawaken my interest and abilities in math.   Combined with a realization that I dislike teaching classes, and that I have natural affinities for applying math, I was motivated to get my shit together, return home and go back to uni in a STEM field. I've decided on a BSEE and have been studying much of the foundational math (Calc 1-3, diff eqs, lin algebra) and physics for engineering in the last year.

math,3e1zqk,respect_cat,3,Tue Jul 21 14:49:15 2015 UTC,"I recently decided to brush up on my calculus, decades after school, and initially it seemed that Khan Academy was the way to go. It takes some time to watch all those videos and do the exercises, but it seemed to work very well at first, and seemed a modern and comfortable way to learn. The problems started when priorities meant that I had to put it on pause for a few months then come back to it, only to find that I'd forgotten some of it. I thought it shouldn't take long to remind myself of the things that I'd forgotten, but how should I do that? Watch all the videos again, fast forwarding over parts that I remembered well? I did in fact try to do that, and found that Youtube (which hosts the KA videos) doesn't like lots of rapid fast forwards alternating with playing short sections. I gave up and decided a rethink was necessary.  Despite videos and online interactivity being very nice, I switched instead to printing out Paul Dawkins' calculus course-note PDFs. (I figured out how to refill my inkjet printer cartridges so that didn't cost much). The old-school method of holding the paper in my hands and walking slowly around my garden path while reading the paper at my own speed turned out to be much faster than video training, and quite pleasant after all. AND most importantly, Paul Dawkins also has some excellent ""cheat sheet"" PDFs, so I could learn the calculus, and then when I did have to pause for a while, the cheat sheets had all that was necessary to give the required mental reminders to pick it all up again in an hour or two. So that's what worked for me:  http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/  There's also good pre-calculus algebra course-notes there if you need that too."

Khan explained it that they have not yet been able  to find a person bad at maths, just a case that certain concepts were not yet mastered.  Working through the training from the beginning algorithmicly works out what you know and don't know and recreates your courses based on what you need to learn next   I went from the very beginning and was stunned that certain sections were very weak.

I didn't even finish algebra I in high school, and notwithstanding that, I had a pretty shoddy math education/education in general before finally taking the Proficiency Exam and gtfo. So I literally started at the beginning, at BASIC ADDITION/SUBTRACTION on Khan Academy because my OCD wanted to be able to say I'd done EVERYTHING. Additionally, I decided to go to college for engineering, so yeah, I would be needing a much stronger math base than I had. I set to work over the summer last year.  I taught myself everything I needed to be able to pass a placement test into precalculus, which I was pretty impressed by. But I was studying for the test. Turned out the course itself was too difficult without really solid algebra II, so I was forced to drop. Consequently, I decided to teach myself everything including precalc so that I could test into calc, because I've realized I learn better on my own anyways and would prefer to spend less time in a math class.  I bought the algebra and precalc books from the Demystified series  in case you want to check them out and have been studying both concurrently while dipping my toes in the calculus book, also from the same series. I have found these resources, in addition to Khan Academy and PatrickJMT immensely helpful and that I would not be where I am today without them.   My biggest tip besides starting from scratch and just covering everything is to immerse yourself in things you don't understand until you're practically drowning in them. Watch videos on integrals and differentials, or even lower level topics that you feel you don't understand well. The point isn't to get it on the first try, the point is to familiarize yourself and prime your brain to form the synapses necessary for when you really are trying to understand those topics. That precalc course I took made almost no sense at the time, but having thrown myself so ardently into it, the same topics actually make sense to me now as I plow through towards calculus. Never underestimate the power of familiarity."

The most recent one was a few years back when I really wanted to find a more accurate way to solve an analytical problem, but had no recourse in recent (going till 1966) literature for the derivation. Then found an old treatise, by G. N. Watson (around 1920, I think), discussing integrals of Bessel functions, and found a remarkably simple result applying that formula.

The time integral of the Lagrangian is then the total liveliness of the system (the action). We then find the stationary value of this expression which is what the trajectory will end up doing.

math,3e3lpx,tactics,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:13 2015 UTC,"I typically explain this to students by just writing what the matrix is supposed to do. If I have a vector x and I coordinatize it with respect to a basis B, I get [x]B.  What if I want to change from my basis B to a new basis, C? Then I should use the matrix PC <- B, and I get the following:  [x]C = PC <- B [x]B  So I see it as a consequence of change-of-coordinates matrices acting on the left rather than the right. I have no historical evidence to back this up, but it's really the only thing I can think of.  (I know this notation for the change-of-basis matrix, etc. can be found in some books; David Lay's books are pretty popular and they use this notation, for example.)"

I believe the first theorem holds in the locally Lipschitz case if it holds in the (global) Lipschitz case. First any measurable A can be written as a countable union of A_i contained in compact balls. The image of a union is the union of the images. So it suffices to consider f(A_i).  A locally Lipschitz function f can be modified off a compact set to be globally Lipschitz. Thus if the theorem holds in the (global) Lipschitz case, then it holds for f(A_i). Therefore f(A) is measurable for f Locally Lipschitz."

math,3e2mhm,unstable_manifold,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:31:27 2015 UTC,"/u/KillingVectr gave you good advice on the last problem, but let me address the second.  Your counterexample doesn't quite work:  Vx{0} is contained in a null set, but it's not measurable.    An easy way to see this is to consider the characteristic function for this set, call it f = f(x,y).  Were the set measurable, then the characteristic function must be a measurable function.  But then, for every y in R, the y-section f_y: x -> f(x,y) is measurable.  Since f_0 is the characteristic function for V, this is a contradiction.    Anyway, the second statement should be true.  If you examine the proof for mappings from Rn to Rn, I suspect that you'll find that there's nothing that requires the domain and codomain have the same dimension."

If y is the type of thing where it's ""Hand me a function and I'll use it in the way I want"" then yes you pass in x. For example, my function y takes another arbitrary (not uniquely defined) function x and translates it by one, so it's y(x, t) = x(t) + 1  Though this is rare, so you probably want just y(t), where x is defined somewhere."
math,3e2hvv,destabilizer,2,Tue Jul 21 16:05:27 2015 UTC,"When you say ""f(a, b)"" it means that f is a function of two variables, and this variables are independent. But x(t) and t obviously are not independent! And keep in mind, that x(t) is an expression of t, for example x(t) = 2t + 1. Then you can rewrite x(t) as ""2t + 1"" in the body of y function: y(t) = (2t + 1) + t = 3t + 1  However, as ginsunuva wrote, in math we have functions that can manipulate other functions. For example y(f, x) -- f is a function, x is a simple variable, y(f, x) = f(x) + 2x + 5. But the correct notation is y(f, x), NOT y(f(x), x)."
math,3e2hvv,Kerdek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:30 2015 UTC,The second would be written if y was a function of two variables. The first variable would be a function and the second would be a value in the function domain.

When you calculate the logarithm of a negative number, you are dealing with the complex logarithm function, which is the inverse of the complex exponential. Because exp(i pi) = -1, the result of inverting gives you log(-1) = i pi.  However, that's not the end of the story. Since the complex exponential (unlike the real exponential) is a many-to-one function, its inverse, the complex logarithm, is one-to-many. Therefore, strictly speaking there is an infinite set of equally valid results for the logarithm of a negative number, differing from each other by multiples of 2 pi i."

Using this definition we can attempt to apply the natural log  ln(|z|ei*arg(z) ) = ln(|z|) + i*arg(z)  Note that though the argument typically ranges from -pi to pi, adding any integer multiple of 2pi gives an equivalent complex number. Logarithms, therefore, are functions which have more than one possible value.  sin and cos (and by extension, all other trigonometric functions derived from them, such as tan) can also be defined in terms of complex numbers although the definition is a bit more difficult to arrive at (but not impossible given just high school math).

But there's nothing unnatural or cheating about that; in fact, it's exactly the way we solved equations of the form 2x=10, by introducing the log function to express its solutions.

(because you have to start the series off somewhere right? and the first generation is pure input, no carryover)  to go back 4 times, you want to end up with 'stock(t-4)' so at each iteration, you have a formula for 'stock(t-1)' by simply using the 'stock(t)' formula but instead renaming t -> t-1  (and obviously t-1 -> t-2)  hope that helps"

Note that this is the same recurrence relation for Sterling Numbers of the First Kind, just with a slightly different initial condition.  But if you're trying to find a nice formula, then that's probably not going to be easy aside from special cases. For instance, An,1 is the nth triangle number, so An,1=n(n+1)/2.

In the meantime I kind of fell in love with math, so I ended up learning the material from the more rigorous courses on my own, and started learning some things outside of the course offerings on my own. I had to petition to take some of the courses I have because on paper I have a weak background compared to others. Other than the grad courses, the rest are fairly standard for third year at my school. I opted to take those specifically because I have learned a lot of algebraic geometry and topology on my own time, and I have already completed the courses my school usually offers on those topics.

This has so far turned out to be a wickedly hard concept to wrap my head around.  Assuming we're working with discrete signals, if you want to just add shifted versions of the signal to itself, you have the following tools: the Z-transform, convolution, and the general theory of difference equations and linear time-invariant systems to work with.   If you just want to add upsampled versions of the signal to itself, you get the Dirichlet transform, Dirichlet convolution, and a whole host of theorems from number theory that give you a nice toolbox for ""linear scale-invariant systems.""  Combining the two has proven to be really tough."
math,3dyiyt,polalavik,2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:24 2015 UTC,hmm upsampling just increases the sampling rate (zero stuffing?) and it already comes with the filtering part to remove the spectral components that come with upsampling. What you're left with is your original signal at a new sampling rate.

Basically sum the squares of the vertical difference between two plots at a set of points (since it sounds like your plots are continuous and not sampled, you could just generate a random set of x coordinates within the relevant range and use those points), and then take the root of that number. This could be thought of as a ""similarity score"" for the two plots in question. So calculate the RMS residuals for plots A and B, and then for B and C, and then you will know which plots are most similar."
math,3e0kuz,ThereOnceWasAMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:26:58 2015 UTC,"The first step is to line up the two graphs you want to compare.  I would do this by finding the 'center of mass' of each, which is simply the average of all the values in the graph.  Subtract the center of mass of each graph from all the points in that graph to move all of the graphs into a common space.  The next step is to quantify the difference in the graphs.  In the general case, you would want to integrate the difference between them, by taking the definite integral when you subtract one from the other.  If you have uniformly sampled points you can approximate this by just getting the average distance between all the pairs of points.  By choosing different error functions, you can decide what is more important in your similarity measure.  For instance, if you just average the absolute differences directly then you consider being off by 1 the whole time to be just as good as being perfect half the time and off by 2 the other half of the time.  However, if you average the squared distances instead, then it will consider being off by 1 the whole time to be twice as good as being off by 2 for half the time, even though the other half of the time was perfect... it biases you toward functions that are consistently close over functions that are perfect except for a few areas that are really off."

Just plugging in the values of w and h gives a pretty good idea of the how much harder 4x5 is than 3x4.  I made a C++ implementation and it's still quite slow. My method is a bit different than yours: Rather than counting the number of islands, I find a random island of zeroes and a random island of ones, and check that their sizes add up to w . h. I tried to speed it up by using bitmasks to represent configurations, building a jumptable to move around in the grid in advance, and caching the starting position for each BFS (since consecutive configurations are very similar).

Add in a vertex at infinity, and connect it to the 2m+2n-4 remaining exterior vertices.   The valid ways of filling the cells with 0's and 1's are in bijection with non-self intersecting oriented paths in G through the point at infinity (the path is just the boundary between the 0 and 1 regions).

You can throw away non-self-intersecting, because by definition a path never touches the same vertex twice (with the possible exception of the start and ends being the same, i.e. a cycle). I assume you wanted the path to be directed so as to define which side of the path is 1s and which is 0s. I think this is unnecessary, and instead you can just multiply the number of paths by two. If we count the number of cycles on the truncated grid graph, and multiply by two, that almost solves our problem.

math,3dxozt,bricksticks,2,Mon Jul 20 17:25:25 2015 UTC,"OK, but then doesn't that make the original question unanswered?  If what you say is true -- the 0°–180° line is the diameter of a circle (and presumably the outer edge of the protractor is the outer circumference of that same circle), and the bottom edge of the plastic of the protractor is just a chord but not the diameter -- then how come the centre of that circle (the printed crosshair on protractor) is not in the centre of the cork circle.  Or alternatively, if the 0°–180° line is the diameter of a circle, and that circle perfectly fits on top of the cork, then the 0°–180° diameter line must also be the diameter line of the cork. But in the photo it's not  Not necessarily disagreeing with you (after all one of the two -- the base of the protractor or the printed 0°–180° -- has to be a chord rather than the diameter), but how does what you say answer the original question?"

It has to be just by looking at it and elimination/logic ... like the first (and ugly) diagram here  But that is the opposite of what what zifyoip was calling ""a properly made protractor"" in this comment sub-thread that I was replying to. In his properly made protractor the black 0°–180° line is the diameter of the circle and the straight edge of the protractor is just a chord. That can't explain this particular photo though, which is why I was asking how him pointing out what a proper protractor is helps to explain this photo. As he clarified, it doesn't - he's just saying what a proper protractor is.   I agree with him btw, basically because I regard my protractor as a ""proper"" protractor (pride, you know) and it blatantly has the black 0°–180° line as the diameter of a semi circle and the straight edge of the plastic as a chord.

You're correct in that you've drawn a bunch of right angles with no relation to the center of the circle, but there are many cases where you want angles drawn from the center. Normally if you're using a protractor on a circle you're attempting to divide the circle up into pieces. For example, using the 120 degree marker to divide a circle into even thirds. It needs to be at the center for this purpose."

You just have to use the center that's inked on the protractor, not the center of the plastic hemisphere.   Find the center of the circle (if you drew your circle with a compass, it's the mark/hole in your paper from the compass point) Place the 0°-180°-90° crossing drawn on the protractor at this point. Place a mark on your paper at the angle(s) you're measuring (120° in your example.) You might want to also place a mark at 0°. Remove the protractor and place your straight edge from the center of the circle to the mark you just made. Draw a line from the center of the circle to the edge of your circle. Repeat for all marks you made. So long as your straight edge is longer than the radius of the circle, this will work with all circles, whether they're larger or smaller than your protractor."

It could be a rectangle or triangle. As long as long as the center point of the angles are marked on the protractor, the shape of the protractor is arbitrary.

A circle with radius equal to the distance from the protractor's center point to the 90 degree mark is smaller than a circle with radius from center point of the protractor to the 180 degree mark... so what?

Why make a protractor like this? The lines are more accurate than the cut of the plastic. If the 0°-180° line was right on edge, there's risk that some of it would be cut off when the plastic was cut out. Certainly we can do precision manufacturing, but then the protractor would cost more and you wouldn't gain a whole lot of benefit."
math,3dxozt,bobpaul,4,Mon Jul 20 15:57:12 2015 UTC,"The angles on the protractor may not meet exactly in the semi circle of the protractor itself. So the lines, though perhaps not visibly so, are not exactly evenly spaced.   It makes more sense when you think of it like this, the goal of the protractor isn't too draw arches over a certain angle, but to make points on an angle that you can draw a line through.   For example, imagine you drew a point at 0 degrees, and one at 100 degrees. You could draw a line from the focal point to these other points, and the two lines would have an angle of 100 degrees between them, but they would not necessarily be the same length, as the arch is somewhat lopsided.   It's also possible that a consumer grade protractor just has shitty gradings..."
math,3dxozt,zaenger,3,Mon Jul 20 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"The physical plastic that makes up the protractor is a perfect semi circle so it perfectly fits the right hand semi circle of the coaster  However, the black printed lines on the protractor (specifically the 0-180 chord line and the outer arc) are not a perfect semi circle. They are a minor segment of the circle.   A protractor works fine like that though. It does mean that the printed graduations are not as you might have intuitively expected (the sectors that make up each graduation don't have rotational symmetry:  they're not all identical if you cut them out and lay them one on top of the other) but that doesn't make any difference to the protractors ability to do its job. When you use it to make angles they will still all be the perfectly correct angles.  Here's an exaggerated diagram to illustrate. Blue is the physical plastic of the protractor (semi circle). Black is the lines printed on it (minor segment) - https://i.imgur.com/BcIwYVY.png  edit: I think that's what another commenter's image proves, but kind of in the opposite way  edit: That isn't true for my protractor though, which except for colour looks identical to OPs but can't be the same. On mine the printed lines are a perfect semi circle (radius=50mm), whereas the physical plastic is a major segment of the same circle but with a base that is extended a bit so it's a chord about 5mm past the diameter.

These letters represent, respectively, the correct identities of the five whiskies, in order. These are the 120 equally likely outcomes of your guessing. You guess C correctly in the cases where the middle letter in the permutation is C; these cases are bolded below. Count them. There are 24 of them. Each one of those cases has probability 1/120.

math,3dxxf3,possiblywrong,3,Mon Jul 20 19:19:57 2015 UTC,"You are overthinking it.  Simply find all of the permutations with 5 items, (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 to simplify things) 120 unique orders.  Your chances of getting them all right are 1/120.  The chances of getting them all wrong is a bit more difficult.  I would say the best way to tackle it would be to freeze the order, call them drinks a b c d and e in glasses 1 2 3 4 and 5.  You could have 5 guesses that give you one correct answer, regardless of how you mess up the other 4.  10 guesses that would give you 2 correct guesses, 9 guesses that give you 3 correct, and 5 guesses that give you 4 correct.  You must also include the one that has 5 correct. The rest would be permutations that have 5 wrong answers.  That would be 30/120, or 1/4 of the time.  Edit:  Okay, so where did I go wrong on my second half?  Did I miss a few possibilities for getting one correct?  Hmmm, there must be more than 5 ways to guess only one beer.  Am I correct in assuming that the order of the missed beers matters?"
math,3dxxf3,polot38,2,Mon Jul 20 16:13:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, the order of the missed beers matter. First, each different order counts as another way out of the 120. Second, you need to make sure that when counting the number of ways to get some correct, each of those ways also gets all the others wrong. Otherwise, you're overlapping. Think about 4 correct, for example. Say you get the first 4 correct. You then need to get the 5th one wrong. Can you do that?"

math,3dyv8t,MurMath,3,Tue Jul 21 09:26:54 2015 UTC,"If you can double major, I'd do that. But if you can't, I'd go with the math major.   I am similar to you. I love the theory of computation and complexity theory. I majored in math and computer science for my undergrad and am starting grad school soon. I knew I wanted to study computational complexity theory, but I had to decide between applying to graduate school in computer science or mathematics. I chose math.   The reason for this is similar to what you say. I admire the mathematician's way of thinking. A CS major often includes a lot of aspects that I don't think will be very useful in addressing these problems.  Things like programming language design, software development, web design etc. These things are useful at giving a person the ability to effectively use a wide variety of tools for creating technology, but aren't as useful when it comes to simple analysis, that is trying to decompose something into its most basic components to understand it at a deeper level. But this is what mathematics is all about. Algebra, topology, graph theory, and linear algebra have all played important roles in the study of computational complexity, so it'd be beneficial to study them in a mathematics program.   Also, the things relating to computational complexity and the theory of computation you'd learn as a CS undegrad will be very basic. If you are an independent type learner, it would be beneficial just to go through some chapters of a good theory of computation book (ex. Michael Sipser's ""Introduction to the Theory of Computation""). Depending on how far you want to pursue this, you may even want to consider a graduate degree and pursue research yourself. It's sad but there is still not very much known about the concepts of computation and how complexity works, so there's not a great deal of knowledge that is very accessible to those who aren't directly researching it.   Finally, I'd recommend following Shtetl-Optimized, a blog by researcher in the field of complexity theory. Many of his posts involve new results that he tries to deliver in a way that is understandable to layman."

One time after taking a course offered by CS department using Sipser's Introduction to the Theory of Computation, I became really fascinated in the theory of computation.  Seeing it's all mathematician's way of thinking in the book , I became enthusiastic about math, and I took two core courses of math department - undergraduate analysis and algebra.  I finished them with decent scores. And I also transfer from CS department to Math department. After the transfer I find a fact a little unsatisfactory: Math department provide no course in theory of computation... So I post a new text post to learn some opinions.  My current career goal is to prepare for entrance exams (including undergrad analysis, linear algebra, abstract algebra) into 2016's math grad school (This is one major way to grad school in Taiwan).

math,3dvlfu,-100-Broken-Windows-,59,Sun Jul 19 22:08:13 2015 UTC,"So is there some method that I'm unaware of to factorise incredibly large numbers?   Well flebron has posted Cole's paper, but there's a similar story about how Fermat claimed  232 + 1 was prime.   Euler managed to show that if 232 + 1 does have a prime factor then that prime factor must be of the form 64k+1 where k is a positive integer. Euler plugged in k = 1,2,3... and eventually for k=10 he found the factor 641 and thereby proved 232 + 1 was composite and he only needed to check fewer than 10 cases to do it."
math,3dvlfu,atrd,58,Sun Jul 19 23:16:32 2015 UTC,"Just to add a small amount of detail...  If 232 +1 has a prime divisor, then 232 = -1 (mod p).  Thus 264 = 1 (mod p).  So 64 must divide the order of the group of units mod p and that's p-1.  Thus, p-1 = 64k so p = 64k+1 and if you plug in numbers, 64k+1 turns out to be composite for a lot of numbers.  For example, if k = 1, we get 65 which is obviously not prime.    So, Euler only had to check 5 numbers before he hit a factor.  Edit: Fixed the space after the exponent as ArneusAdoro suggested."

math,3dvlfu,STUPID_REDDIT_INJOKE,7,Mon Jul 20 13:31:33 2015 UTC,So 64 must divide the order of the group of units mod p and that's p-1.   Can you explain this step please?
math,3dvlfu,thenumber0,4,Mon Jul 20 10:21:46 2015 UTC,"In this context ""units mod p"" just means numbers 0<k<p such that k and p are coprime. If we consider the operation of multiplying these numbers mod p, i.e., multiplying the numbers, then taking the remainder when you divide the product by p, this collection of numbers forms a group.  One very useful property of groups is that whenever one group, G, contains another group, H, the number of elements in H always divides the number of elements in G. Since 264=1 mod p, we know that the elements {1, 2, 22, 23, ..., 263} form a group with 64 elements within the group of units, and therefore the number of elements in the group of units, p-1, must be divisible by 64.  You might be concerned about how we know that these 64 elements are unique. After all, if, say, 216=1 mod p, then 264=1 mod p as well, but now there are only 16 unique elements in that set. However, any proper divisor of 64 is also a (not necessarily proper) divisor of 32, so if 2n=1 mod p for some n<64, then 232=1 mod p as well. Since 232=-1 mod p, we know that this isn't the case.  For those interested in the slightly more technical side of things, ""elements mod n"" aren't quite the same as the non-negative integers less than n exactly. They're generally taken to be equivalence classes of integers with equality mod n as the equivalence relation. Those n elements then form a ring. It can be convenient to identify them with representative elements 0≤k<n, however."
math,3dvlfu,Fenring,2,Mon Jul 20 12:07:42 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks!  The fact that   the elements {1, 2, 22, 23, ..., 263} form a group   is what I didn't think to consider.  In this case we surely don't have a ring since the powers of 2 don't form an additive group?"
math,3dvlfu,thenumber0,2,Mon Jul 20 12:27:56 2015 UTC,"Those elements don't form a ring, no. The full set {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., p-1} does, though. That's why {1, 2, 3, ..., p-1} is the ""group of units"". The units in a ring are the elements with multiplicative inverses, and in Z/nZ those are the elements that are coprime with n. More specifically, since everything but 0 is a unit in Z/pZ (p being prime), this is actually a field."

It follows that if any pair of adjacent cards (or cards that are one apart) are flipped, then all N cards must be flipped.  If N!=0 mod 3 then we cannot divide all the cards into disjoint adjacent triples, so some adjacent pair (or pair that is one apart) of cards must be flipped (otherwise we cannot flip all the cards), so all cards must be flipped in that case.

If you really have not worked at all with matrices, like never done row reduction, and/or calculated determinants, you should read the beginning of Strang's Linear Algebra and Its Applications, because you need to know how to row reduce and find a determinant.  You could read Dummit and Foote's Abstract Algebra. If you have not done module theory, chapter 10 is good (leave out sections 10.4 and 10.5 on your first pass).  Then chapters 11-12 connect module theory to linear algebra (because linear algebra  is just a special case). They present a concise and coherent treatment. Leave out section 11.5 on your first pass.   I recommend not skipping the exercises in Dummit and Foote!  D&F do not include anything on inner product spaces, so I would recommend supplementing with Steven Roman's Advanced Linear Algebra chapters 9-10 (on inner product spaces and normal operators). When I first found this book, I was elated that someone had written a thorough linear algebra book for someone who could think algebraically and not always in terms of matrices.

Most of these jobs I found unappealing and I don't think I would have been competitive getting an interview for.  My take on OP's question. If you are working on applied math focused more on differential equations, the closest job you will get with your degree (assuming no previous work experience) would be doing software dev at a graphics company. Most other jobs I think would either require a graduate degree or would prefer engineers.  If you are just looking to apply math in your job in a nontrivial (e.g. crunching numbers) way, I would suggest looking into Data Science and Machine Learning where you can readily put ideas from stats and optimization into your work. Again, the amount of math you get to apply will be related to your level of education (more degrees more math), but it's more mathy than say being an analyst (which from my experience is copy numbers from one sheet to another and run a macro).

For example if your number is abcde (where a,b,c,d,e are some digits in faux base-26 system) then the formula is 264a + 263b + 262c + 26d + e.

Digits 1-26 will correspond to the letters A-Z, and digit 0 will correspond to no letter. Then, you can very easily encode the letter sequences into base 10 numerical values and decode the base 10 numerical values into their corresponding letter sequences by simply converting between base 27 and base 10 and vice versa.   For example, consider the letter sequence ""reddit"": 'r' = 18, 'e' = 5, 'd' = 4, 'd' = 4, 'i' = 9, 't' = 20. As a base 27 number, this would be 18x275 + 5274 + 4273 + 4272 + 9271 + 20*270 = 261019442 (base 10). We have ""encoded"" the letter sequence reddit into a base 10 numerical value. To decode it, we take the base 10 numerical value 261019442, and convert it into base 27 (you can look up how to do this if you google the repeated subtraction method or something. It's very simple, but I'm not going to do it here as it would take a long time for such a big number). You would end up with a number like this [18][5][4][4][9][20] (where the things inbetween [] are a single digit). You then would simply use a lookup table to associate each digit with the corresponding letter (e.g. 18 = 'r', etc.)  Hope this answers your question!"

math,3dzkln,dalastboss,4,Tue Jul 21 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"This is why simplification of the incompleteness theorems is probably not a great idea. This statement isn't true.  Formal logical systems totally can, and in fact Gödel proved it with his completeness theorem. The incompleteness theorem was about formal theories strong enough to represent arithmetic with addition and multiplication (because Presburger arithmetic with only addition is complete)   A formal logical system that's strong enough to represent arithmetic will still prove all theorems. That's also a consequence of the completeness theorem. But not all statements are provable. There can be undecidable statements. Or put another way, every statement which is a logically valid consequence of the axioms (true in all possible interpretations) under general semantics is provable even if the theory can represent arithmetic, but there are statements which aren't decidable, that can't ever be proven from the axioms, and some of these unprovable statements are true (under the standard model of arithmetic, which is another subtle and important caveat.)   With a weak system, like arithmetic with only addition, you can determine the model theoretic truth of every statement with syntactic proof. Add multiplication and you can't anymore.  This is further expanded on with Church's theorem, which says we know even less. While the completeness theorem says you can always find in a finite number of steps if a first order statement is logically valid or invalid (and thus if any statement is a theorem of a theory) first order satisfiablity is undecidable. That is, there are first order statements that not only we can't prove from the axioms of a particular theory, but we can't ever prove have any models at all."
math,3dzkln,dezakin,2,Tue Jul 21 07:48:09 2015 UTC,"Not quite sure how to explain to a five year old incompleteness of formal systems, but I'll give a go of explaining it to someone who might understand what statements in a formal language are.   Basically the first incompleteness theorem says there are statements in any theory powerful enough to represent arithmetic  with addition and multiplication that are undecidable... that is they don't have a truth value that is derivable from the axioms. Consequences of that are the models of these theories have statements that are unprovable but true (or unprovable but false.) These are slightly different statements, which is where one of the many misconceptions about the incompleteness theorems come from.   This is a big deal, because  set theory, or really any other theory that can serve as a foundation for mathematics can represent arithmetic, so that means there are statements that are unprovable in whatever foundation you want.  The second incompleteness theorem says that no theory powerful enough to represent arithmetic can prove its own consistency. The consequences for this are pretty big also, but weirder in some ways. I think this means really strange stuff, like the negation of ZFC must be consistent... because if it wasn't ZFC would be provably logically valid, and that would violate the second incompleteness theorem.   What this means is we have very hard limits on our ability to reason about mathematics. We can tell if a system is broken, but we can't tell if it works. It also introduced the annoying assumption we have to preface with whenever we prove something about set theory, like independence proofs of the continuum hypothesis (Assume ZFC is consistent... bla bla bla)   Philosophically it's important also (for those that actually understand it and don't abuse the model theoretic simplification of unprovable but true.) It also opens the door to denying mathematical Platonism; while  there are preferred models with reasons for them (standard model of arithmetic with Tennenbaum's theorem) their connection to syntactic consequence doesn't always exist, and so some models may not have any ""reality"" at all."

Showing that every positive integer has a prime factor uses very little, mostly just the Well-Ordering principle and some basic properties of divisibility. On the other hand, the uniqueness relies on the existence of a division algorithm which allows you to prove if p divides ab then p divides a or b, which settles the uniqueness of such factorizations."

If we keep in mind that <x|ψ> = ψ(x) (the wavefunction), and <x|Dψ> = dψ/dx gives the derivative of the wavefunction. The derivative D is also the infinitesimal generator of translation. D+ is the conjugate action of D, and D+ acts on the coordinate x in the same way that D acts on ψ: as an infinitesimal translation. However, translating the coordinate system forwards is equivalent to translating the wavefunction backwards; This is the difference between passive and active translations.

math,3dvf8n,mathriver149,4,Sun Jul 19 21:16:06 2015 UTC,"I'm borrowing from This. The function (Z/DZ)x -> (-D/--), sending n to (-D/n) is essentially a map from the Galois group of K=Q(sqrt(-D)) over Q into {1,-1} (fleshing this out more gives Quadratic Reciprocity). So we can think of (-D/n) being an element of G(K/Q) in a natural way. If I have a fractional ideal I of K, then the Galois group will act on I in a meaningful way. So this means that (-D/n) acts on ideals in a way that encode the Galois structure of the extension.   We can then look at T=1/D(Sum n(-D/n)), which is just a linear combination of group elements of the Galois Group, and a famous result of Stickelberger says that whenever I act on a fractional ideal J of K by T, I will get end up with a principle ideal (there are a few subtleties here, in finding exactly the right object, but that's the idea). But I can just evaluate this as an integer and have this integer act on the class group. This integer will send everything in the ideal class group to zero, but so will the size of the group. It turns out that in this case, these are the same value so evaluating the Stickelberger element will give you the size of the class group.  This is probably as combinatorial as you'll get in this proof. The other proofs of this require the Analytic Class Number Formula, which is a result from analytic number theory."

math,3dvc9y,acid2,14,Sun Jul 19 20:50:40 2015 UTC,"Algebraic varieties are simply the sets of points which are solutions to collections of polynomials. Many basic examples in two variables are the same examples you'd learn about in a high school algebra or calculus course.   Schemes are varieties with extra algebraic data. Every variety is a scheme, not every scheme is a variety. The best way I have found to think about this is using the following idea: if you take a circle and a line meeting it in the plane, then for most of the lines you might choose, they meet the circle in two points. The two points of the intersection form a variety. In fact, the two points determine the line. But what happens when I start moving the line in a fixed direction (not parallel to the line)? Eventually, the line becomes tangent to the circle, and I get just a single point which no longer even determines the line! In some sense, something has gone really wrong here. What happened to the other point? Well, if we observe very closely what happens to the two points as right around where the line becomes tangent to the circle, we see that the two points actually collide. So some information is lost if we only consider the set theoretic or variety intersection. We'd like things to be more consistent than that because otherwise it makes thinking about varieties hard. Schemes readily fix this problem. When the line becomes tangent to the circle, not only is the point of intersection recorded, but so is the direction of the tangent line to the circle. This information, unlike that of just the point, still determines the line, and as such carries the same information as two points!   This is one of very many reasons why schemes are useful."

This example was chosen because it is the simplest nontrivial example of a scheme theoretic intersection I know.  However, if you want something more complicated: take the cone over a smooth conic in the plane and intersect it with a plane. Vary the plane into the tangent plane to the cone. The generic fiber will be a conic, while the sepcial fiber will be a line set theoretically and a ""double line"" scheme theoretically. This example has the added benefit of displaying a divisor on a variety which is not Cartier but is Q Cartier.   Also, your method does not work over arbitrary fields."
math,3dvc9y,wristrule,5,Mon Jul 20 03:28:16 2015 UTC,"Varieties are objects built up out of the vanishing sets of polynomial equations.  For example, the vanishing of the equation y-x2 is a parabola.  They are geometric objects specified by algebraic data, and for a long time, algebraic geometry could be described as the study of how geometric properties of varieties depended on algebraic properties of defining data.  Schemes are an outgrowth of varieties that are hybrid objects, they contain both algebraic and geometric data (they are topological spaces, but for every open set, U, you also have the ""ring of functions on U."").  They accomplish a few things.  First, unlike the zero set of a collection of equations, schemes are not necessarily embedded into some ambient (affine or projective) space, and so it follows that things you prove about schemes depend only on the internal structure of the scheme, and not in the way it sits inside.  Another thing is that it makes the coupling between algebra and geometry much tighter.  A third thing is that, by generalizing varieties, it allows  you to view some things in number theory in terms of geometric concepts, which enriches both fields.  I'm not sure the best path for self study, although there are a number of good lecture notes (e.g., Ravi Vakil's) on the web.  Varieties and calssical algebraic geometry do not require too much prerequisites, but scheme theory definitely requires a firm grasp on commutative algebra and (the language of) category theory.  I should add that, if you are going to study schemes and modern algebraic geometry, I would probably try to get some exposure to differential geometry (up to the level of bundles) first.  This isn't strictly necessary, but there will be a lot of constructions and object that will seem at best unmotivated and at worst completely mystifying otherwise.  Along the same lines, moden algebraic geometry uses a lot of cohomology theory, and  it is for the best if your first exposure to (co)homology is in the context of algebraic topology.  Again, this is not strictly necessary, but it will help you in building your intuition about what the cohomology theories are supposed to be telling you in nice cases."
math,3dvc9y,bizarre_coincidence,4,Sun Jul 19 22:49:26 2015 UTC,"Varieties have always been the basic objects of study in algebraic geometry (essentially they are sets defined by f_1 = ... = f_n = 0, where the f_i are polynomials). Schemes are a generalization that enhance, streamline, and codify the study of varieties, which had been somewhat non-rigorous for a time. The language of schemes also encodes much of algebraic number theory, so in essence it is a single language that practitioners of both subjects use for somewhat different purposes."
math,3dvc9y,SheafCobromology,2,Sun Jul 19 21:10:33 2015 UTC,"let k be a field, and let [; \mathbb{A}n (k) ;] be an affine space over k (essentially 'just an n-dimensional k-vector space' is good enough to understand what's going on).   Take the ring of polynomials [; k[X_1 ,X_2, \ldots , X_n ] ;], which can be seen as functions on our affine space. If [; f ;] is such a polynomial, then [; V(f) = { X\in\mathbb{A}n : f(X) =0 } ;] is called the zero set of [; f ;]. As a subset of [; \mathbb{A}n ;], it is called an affine algebraic set. If it is irreducible, then it is an affine algebraic variety.  What does irreducible mean for an affine set to be irreducible? Rather simply, an algebraic set is irreducible if it cannot be written as a union of other algebraic sets.   Algebraic varieties in [; \mathbb{A}2 (k) ;] are called affine plane curves. So [; V(Y-X2) \subset \mathbb{A}2 (\mathbb{R}) ;] is the curve (i.e., a set of zeroes) which corresponds to the line we would draw for [; y=x2 ;].

math,3dvc9y,F-0X,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:33:34 2015 UTC,"Here's a different take on schemes which takes the point of view that schemes are generalizations of manifolds.    A manifold is some set that ""looks like"" n-dimensional real space, Rn .  This is a terribly imprecise notion as such and it's worth looking at the definition(s) of manifold to see exactly what's going on. There are several versions, the first is a topological manifold which is a topological space X with the property that each point is contained in an open set that is homeomorphic to Rn .  So a topological manifold is a topological space that is ""locally deformable to Rn "".  The next version of manifold is just a topological manifold with some more structure called a  differentiable manifold.  The added structure is that if U_1 and U_2 are any open sets in X with   f_1:U_1-->Rn and f_2:U_2-->Rn   the respective homeomorphisms, the composition of f_1-1 (f_2) is required to be differentiable.  This extra structure allows you to do calculus on X by simply mapping the thing to Rn when necessary and it forces X to be ""smooth"".  So a differentiable manifold is something that is ""locally, smoothly, deformable to Rn.  Notice that part of the definition of a scheme is the requirement that each point is contained an open set U that is homeomorphic to Spec(A) where A is a commutative ring. So a scheme is a basically a manifold, but instead of being locally isomorphic to Rn, it's locally isomorphic to Spec(A).    But why Spec(A) (= prime ideals in A) instead of Rn ?? I.e. How is Spec(A) like Rn and why use it?    The answer comes in the form of a theorem called Gelfand duality.    Gelfand showed that there is a 1-1 correspondence between compact  Hausdorff  topological spaces and real commutative C* -algebras.  The way it works is, given compact a topological space X, you get a real commutative C* -algebra, namely C(X,R):=ring of functions X-->R.  Conversely, given a real commutative C* -algebra, call it A, you can form a topological space out of the maximal ideals of A, sometimes denoted MaxSpec(A).    At some point, someone noticed that Hilbert's Nullstellensatz was basically a version of Gelfand Duality (or perhaps vice versa.)  To see this, you need to know that an algebraic variety defined over k (k here is some field is a the zero set of of a collection of polynomials.  E.g. take all the points (x,y) so that y-x2=0 in R2 , this is also known as a parabola.  On any algebraic variety V, there is a ring of functions (similar to C(X,R)), called the ring of regular functions usually denoted k[V] (also called the coordinate ring).  k[V] is simply the ring of polynomial functions V-->k.  Note the similarity to C(X,R).   Hilbert's Nullstellensatz says that, if k is algebraically closed, then there is a 1-1 correspondence between maximal ideals in k[V] and points on V.   Well, shit, that's almost Gelfand right therem just put a topology on V (this is actually not obvious how to do from the definitions), called the Zariski then you're in Gelfand territory.    So, we've seen two instances of the idea ""points in X <--> maximal ideals in ring of functions on X"".  Grothendieck's great idea (one of many) was to look at all prime ideals of a ring A, call this set Spec(A) and to put a topology on it, also called the Zariski topology.  Using Spec(A) as your topological space gives A as the ring of functions on Spec(A).  So much as we went X-->C(X,R) and V-->k[V], we can go Spec(A)-->A.  The ""closed"" points in Spec(A) still correspond to the maximal ideals of A, same as Gelfand, but using Spec(A) instead of Rn gives you a bridge between anything that locally looks like Spec(A) (e.g. algebraic varieties) and the land of manifolds.    You can now take some technique from manifolds and walk back across the bridge to apply it to the space that locally looks like Spec(A).  The really slick part (I think) is that A can be any ring, the integers for instance.  You can, in effect, do stuff from differential topology in number theory by taking diff topo across the bridge.    Edit: many..."

An inverse function only exists when f is one-to-one, so it is necessary to at least give a proof that f is one-to-one before applying the inverse function. The inverse function may not be additive.  Applying f-1 to f(a)+f(b) may not yield a+b, but you seem to have assumed this in your calculation. You applied f-1 to f(x) and somehow got xf(x), which you then decided was 0.  You should get x instead. You have taken the equation x + f(x) = f-1 (x) and concluded that f(x)=x, but f(x) does not satisfy that equation. Even when examining the equation x + f(x) = f-1 (x) + x, we cannot conclude that f(x)=x, only that f(x) = f-1 (x).  There are other functions satisfying this equation, for example f(x)=-x."

math,3dtux1,mscroggs,4,Sun Jul 19 12:16:21 2015 UTC,"The ""One two three"" puzzle can be viewed as a starting point for a very rich area of mathematics.  Two natural extensions:   What if instead of two colors, we had k colors.  Could we still find two points and their midpoint that are the same color? Two points and their midpoint correspond to a three term arithmetic progression.  What if instead you wanted an r term arithmetic progression, all the same color?   If you take both of these extensions at once, you get what's now known as Van der Waerden's Theorem (Van der Waerden's theorem is when you color the integers, but that's equivalent to the real version).    You could imagine strengthening things still further.  If I'm coloring the integers with a finite number of colors, at least one of the colors has positive (upper) density by a pigeonhole argument.  As it turns out, just having positive density is already enough to force arithmetic progressions of any length.  This fact was conjectured by Erdos and Turan in the 1930s, but even the case of three term progressions was only proven by Klaus Roth in 1953.  The full proof had to wait until the 1970s and the work of Szemeredi."

A pretty elegant solution is this;  If the second hand stays on a ""tick"" (we'll call every 60th of a rotation around the clock a ""tick""), then the minute hand and hour hand must be as well in order to be 1/3 around the clock from the second hand. The only time a minute hand will be on a tick is when the second hand is at 12. This means the minute hand is either at 4 or 8. The hour hand would then have to point at the one the minute hand isn't on, which is impossible, based on the fact that the minute hand must be at 12 for the hour hand to be pointing at a number directly (""on the hour). The proposed situation is impossible."

math,3dvmiw,PancakeMSTR,3,Sun Jul 19 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"Basically, cross products are more naturally expressed as rank 2 antisymmetric tensor than vectors because each component of the cross product involves two components of the vectors of which you're taking the cross product (e.g., if L = p x r is the angular momentum, L_z = p_x y - p_y x). Now, L_z is associated with rotations about the z axis, or equivalently rotations in the xy plane. The tensor notation labels the rotation by the plane rather than the axis, i.e. L_ij=p_i r_j - p_j r_i. In three dimensions, we have just relabeled the three components, but this is kind of a happy accident as the number of axes, 3, is equal to the number of planes, 3 choose 2. If we move to 4 dimensions, adding say a w axis, we now have 6 planes but only 4 axes; the planes correspond to the rotations we can make, so using the tensor language is the correct choice."

I apologize for being slow.   The problem is I'm not exactly sure how to explain what I don't understand. In terms of the quantitative stuff you wrote, I understand everything (I'm a but lost on the conceptual stuff you wrote), but I basically still don't understand how you can put all that, e.g. [;L_{ij} = p_i r_j - p_j r_i;] into a matrix and call it the cross product and go on with your day. Like, mathematically it just makes no sense to me. How did they get that definition for the tensor?   For clarity, Landau and Lifshitz define the moment of force tensor   [;M_{ik} = F_x x_k - F_k x_i;]   and then have a little footnote justifying it that goes    ""the moment of the force F is defined as the vector product [;\mathbf{F}\times\mathbf{r};], and we know from vector analysis that the components of a vector product form an antisymmetrical tensor of rank two as written here."""
math,3dvmiw,VGramarye,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:40:25 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, whether an object is a scalar, vector, ranks two tensor, etc. is determined by how it transforms when we change bases; for example, this transformation could be a rotation.  A scalar will not change at all under a rotation (for example, the dot product between two vectors does not change when we rotate our axes, as it only depends on the lengths of the vectors and the angle between them). A vector will transform with one copy of the rotation matrix (or its inverse, depending on if you're talking about a row or column vector). A rank N tensor will transform with N rotation matrices.  Here's an example: say I apply the parity transformation (x --> -x, y --> -y, z --> -z) to  the two vectors (say A and B) of which I'm taking the cross product. Then A goes to -A and B goes to -B, but their cross product, A x B, goes to (-A) x (-B) = A x B (i.e. stays the same). Any vector V would go to -V under a parity transformation, so the cross product is not really a vector."

I saw that the motion of the point was a function of the linear and angular velocities induced, and the angular velocity involved a couple of cross products with the delta to the center of mass, along with a multiply by the inverse inertia tensor.  Converting the cross products into matrix multiplies allowed me to concatenate everything into a single matrix, and I could solve for the impulse by inverting that matrix.  This assumes the motion induced by the angular velocity is linear and tangential, so the more rotation that is introduced the less accurate this method is.  It still ends up being a pretty good approximation though."

I know of one person fresh out of a top astrophysics PhD program (with 0 work experience) get an offer of $550k.   EDIT: I should clarify that these are definitely on the high-end. When I gave the 200k figure, I was talking about a front office position directly supporting traders generating revenue. Only about 10-20% of the top MFE program students get those jobs. If you want average statistics, just check the CMU website (or I'm sure Columbia/NYU also posts some stats on this).

Some of the US schools have internships built-in to the master's course while others have a dedicated career service to place students.  If I recall correctly, some US schools like CMU Masters in Comp Fin boasts a 99% placement rate into an internship or full-time position within 3 months of graduating.  Nobody's going to hand you the job - if you don't apply, you're not getting a job.

math,3ds4zd,Bromskloss,5,Sun Jul 19 01:23:37 2015 UTC,"Trader here, working in quant heavy product ~5y now at a bulge bracket..  I'll give a few answers from my exp.   What is the most likely place at which to get a quant position? Big bank? Tiny, algo-trading prop shop?    With no exp at all in finance and no phd?  Sell-side.     What is the more interesting place?   Depends on what you find interesting.  Are you research oriented who wants to ""win the game"" (so to speak), then you'll enjoy buy-side at an algo hedge fund.  Are you looking to creatively produce bespoke structured solutions that meet a clients specific needs?  Bank will be more your thing.   Does it ever fall upon a quant to propose a new kind of derivative to be offered to others? I'm thinking that a reason might be that the quant is confident about how to price this particular derivative. Maybe there is even a pitfall in its analysis that the quant villainously expects that competitors might fall into.   You won't right away but structuring desks are a common place for STEM to end up.  Structuring is literally the creation of bespoke derivatives for what a client wants, then pricing it out and managing the risk on the bank exposure, especially with regards to second order exposure.  And no, banks do not operate in the ""lets take out the other guy"" kind of competition.  It's not a sustainable business model to run your clients into the ground.   From the perspective of what country are you speaking? Does the same picture hold all over the world?   US.  US is king/hq for structuring, though London and Hong Kong are slowly picking up, they're a far cry from the market size of NA.   What types of positions do you count as quant jobs?   ""Quant"" is a very vague description.  There are a LOT of bank jobs that require technical background.  Very little of it is rocket science though.  The most quant heavy people aren't the ones deriving the products and trading.... it's the guys who are spending every day creating the tools for which us traders use to model our products and entire book exposure."
math,3ds4zd,verik,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:06:46 2015 UTC,"With no exp at all in finance and no phd? Sell-side.    What about with a PhD?   And no, banks do not operate in the ""lets take out the other guy"" kind of competition. It's not a sustainable business model to run your clients into the ground.   OK, so the product would be directed at a specific client? What I had in mind was a situation where you invent a derivative and put it ""out there"" on the market in general, possibly hoping that you will be better at pricing it than other marked participants will be. Maybe that isn't how things are done in practice."
math,3ds4zd,Bromskloss,2,Sun Jul 19 10:11:07 2015 UTC,"What about with a PhD?   Still starting at a bank.  Some hedge funds like rentec or two sigma will be interested in you if your phd thesis is working with neural network.  But the hedge fund world is far more niche than the usefulness at a bank.   OK, so the product would be directed at a specific client? What I had in mind was a situation where you invent a derivative and put it ""out there"" on the market in general, possibly hoping that you will be better at pricing it than other marked participants will be. Maybe that isn't how things are done in practice.   Correct that's not at all how things are done.  ""Inventing derivatives"" isn't done at a bank simply for the sake of creating a market in something.  It's done because there are needs by a client that need to be addressed.  Sell-side's business is all about being client focused, not ""mastering the markets"" or any other misconception where you're trying to take down the other participants.  How you price second order risk may affect how you see a product vs another bank but it's really not about that.  Other markets I didn't bring up would be working on somewhere like a DMA equity desk (the desk all the HFT's/algo's trade through).  Here you'd be focused 100% on latency coding and risk protocols for the platform so that the bank doesn't lose $100mm in a split second."
math,3ds4zd,verik,4,Sun Jul 19 14:41:38 2015 UTC,"/u/verik's pretty much got you covered. Here's my view/response:   What is the most likely place at which to get a quant position? Big bank? Tiny, algo-trading prop shop? What is the more interesting place?   Banks usually. If you have a PhD, many data-science focused shops might want you. Some bigger ones include Winton, Jane St.   Is prior experience of trading, with own money or at least on paper, seen as necessary (maybe considered a display of commitment)?   If it's manual, not as much. If you have an algorithm or a strategy that you can share/communicate clearly: yes, very much so. Especially on the Hedge Fund side.   Does it ever fall upon a quant to propose a new kind of derivative to be offered to others? I'm thinking that a reason might be that the quant is confident about how to price this particular derivative. Maybe there is even a pitfall in its analysis that the quant villainously expects that competitors might fall into.   I would say a structuring fellow would propose a new kind of derivative or perhaps the client requests something very customized and the quant would have to work out its price and risk.    From the perspective of what country are you speaking? Does the same picture hold all over the world?   USA: New York for banks, Chicago and Stamford, CT for hedge funds  UK: London is getting big for both banks and hedge funds. Example KCG, Winton were hiring in London recently.  Singapore: Banks might put their quants there, cheaper than HK and Tokyo. Hedge funds are up and coming here too.   What types of positions do you count as quant jobs?

Quants sit on the ""Sales and Trading"" side of the bank - which includes Sales and Trading, Risk Management, Product/Financial Control, Technology, Compliance, Operations, and a few other departments.  The S&T side of the bank tends to be slightly less 'grueling'. Hours can range from a typical 55 hours / week maybe up to 70 hours / week. Almost no weekends either.

I, personally, do cost analysis (but more specifically a ton or stats analysis and predictive methods), but there's a place for mathematicians in virtually every sector on base. I think my job is a little different because it decidedly is NOT finance or accounting, which I think some math majors get shoehorned into.  Also, if you were in any organizations in school that do conferences with job fairs (SWE, NSBE, AIAA, SHPE, etc), GO TO THEM. Reach out to alums from those organizations. Networking is your biggest stepping stone to a job.  A quick edit, because I'd like to point this out: I do little to no programming which also stands out from most other common ""math"" jobs. We use Excel, so Visual Basic is a plus, but I think it's fairly easy to pick up.  Also, as a recent graduate, you'd be starting around a GS-07 on the pay scale, so that's a good thing to look for in your searches."

Do both and you have a better chance. Not all agencies will have them, but some do and they're more useful than USAJobs.  Personally, I applied for my job on USAJobs, then chased it at every conference I could go to until I spoke to a recruiter in person about the specific job at the specific location it was at. Student organizations are incredibly useful for this specific purpose.  Quick edit: I should mention that USAJobs openings change a LOT.

math,3ds4zd,Mavmar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:56:46 2015 UTC,"I think Iowa is cool. A big pro is that you get to work with programming in dynamically typed languages (typically, it's rare a shop that tries to do data analysis in Java). Beyond that it's hard to say more pros because it depends on your role. If you are junior level then you will learn a lot if you have a senior mentor. I would guess you aren't senior level with a BS in math, but you may be ""their first data analyst"" in which case you get a lot of freedom to find patterns in large datasets. Cons? Not many, it's a job and you may not be surrounded by super math people though if they saw the value in hiring a data analyst then they probably have some appreciation of math. Maybe lack of vacation depending on your employer. It's not academia with it's summer vacations and so on, but truth is that is for any job so I wouldn't put that in the ""cons"" for data analysis. HOWEVER, many people are entering it now because they think it's hot, but they then burn out when they realize that you have to really love learning new tech tools quickly. That's not like hanging out in best buy, it's more like reading through tons of stack exchange questions and library documentation to understand how to fix/do what you want. Also some people do ""dumb"" 000 level stats for their work, and some people do 700 level stats, and it all depends on your position's role and training."
math,3ds4zd,fitzgerald1337,2,Sun Jul 19 14:08:21 2015 UTC,"Pros:  The work is interesting - I never do the same thing two days in a row (Excluding multi-day projects).   I work with people that are passionate about what they do.  The job allows me the ability to constantly update my work - a query I wrote months ago may be extremely inefficient and something I learned today lets me go back and make it X number of times better.  Taking the job didn't require me to have a crazy background - I had a degree in applied mathematics and a bit of a background programming and I was about to learn a lot of what I needed on the job.   Because we're sort of the behind the scenes people - our time schedules are a bit more lax. I show up to work around 8-830, my manager at 9 and some team members closer to 10.  Cons:  Occasionally I'll have to do some work after hours (I'm salaried so there really is no overtime). It's usually nothing too serious, mostly just clicking a few buttons to run a query or checking up to make sure a query actually ran. It's not too bad but it's definitely a little annoying when all you may want to do is relax that day.  A downside for my position at least is sometimes people in the company don't have realistic expectations of what we can give them and so they end up expecting the world and you just can't give it to them.  The work can come in waves - you can have one week were you have very minimal to do and then the next week servers might be crashing and your world is pretty much on fire.  The only other downside I can think of at the moment is that because we are background people our work can often be overlooked for it's necessity/importance."

For those wondering what your career trajectory will be like if you enter this field, it is roughly comparable to that of a computer programmer or (Sr.) software developer depending on your role. There are obviously roles with different responsibilities, so to understand the career path try to make an analogy between a position you are offered and a position in programming/software and you will be able to understand. Most companies/departments hiring data analysts/scientists are tech companies/departments so in their mental model they will try to fit you in those boxes.  Chief data scientist here AMAA.

The only thing I'd say is lacking (based on your brief description) is you haven't mentioned research skills. You could have a solid career doing work like you have been doing, but a lot of the work in this field is research capability. If you can, I would suggest at your current job to look for problems your part of the company has had trouble solving, and try to figure out solutions to them. It often takes a few weeks to get a solid proposal for a solution to an old problem, but if you can do that a few times it would be the ideal kind of research experience to move vertically in data science/analysis. A fluency in basic Machine Learning and Inferential Statistics helps, even doing something like a Coursera course nights and weekends will give you the ability to speak in the language people are looking for: test/training data, mathematical modeling, model validation, model complexity, benchmark comparision, statistical significance, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, different types of classifiers and their different mathematical properties, and some NLP in so far as you know the difference between a regular grammar, a context free grammar, a parsable expression grammer and why and when you would use each of them to parse something."

I'll copy and paste something I wrote elsewhere:   For those wondering what your career trajectory will be like if you enter this field, it is roughly comparable to that of a computer programmer or (Sr.) software developer depending on your role. There are obviously roles with different responsibilities, so to understand the career path try to make an analogy between a position you are offered and a position in programming/software and you will be able to understand. Most companies/departments hiring data analysts/scientists are tech companies/departments so in their mental model they will try to fit you in those boxes."

Then I went into Supply Chain, where my math degree allowed me to flourish.  I traveled around the world, working with many different companies and industries.  The Industrial Engineering part was easy.  I read the books, but I also had the ability to create mathematical representations of situations, then program them into models, and run simulations.  This proved an invaluable skill for my career.  Was learning Industrial Engineering truly easy?  No, but learning how to design warehouses was a damn site easier than teaching greenhorn Masters in Industrial Engineering how to approach problems quantitatively (creating equations which matched the 'reality' we were observing)."

It just took an investment of time.  Perhaps, I just latched onto the material naturally.  I don't know, but I found it all very intuitive.  Also, I could:  1.) Modify the existing 'standard' equations to meet the criteria that I needed, 2.) Developed new equations, as needed, to understand a situation quantitatively, 3.) Think critically (not only how to approach a problem and frame it, but how to solve it)."

math,3ds4zd,avoiding_my_thesis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:56:04 2015 UTC,"I was a consultant and engineer.  The work was absolutely wonderful.  My work-life balance was pretty terrible, but I have since used the years of experience (very dense and fast, which is good to upgrade your abilities and knowledge) to get another job, one which does respect this.  To answer your question, probably 50-90 (ave. 65-70) hr/wk.  Although, there could be a few weeks (or a couple of months) of 80's in a row (I typically got an extra 2-3 weeks of vacation just tossed in there, to keep me from burning out).  It was brutal, but I could not have gotten my new job without the intensity/density (new job is 40 and great).  It was interesting: I have worked with a vast variety of industries (ex. food and beverage (Nestle), automotive, pharmacological, textiles, and many others); The problems were unique, and I learned many new things everyday (be it industry specific or increasing my abilities directly).  Almost every single day was different than the last (plus/minus depending on your character, but I loved it).  It was challenging:  There were no true pat answers; I almost always had to invent a solution to match the problem.  It was rewarding:  Helping people make their work easier and more effective; Working directly with a dock worker or someone on the line, all the way to suiting up and telling a boardroom of execs that we're going to save $10M.  It was fun:  Meeting so many people with incredible skills, working with them, and then going out (work hard/party hard).  I made friends around the world that I still talk with.  Had many ships-in-the-night encounters (I'm single).  Ate at some of the best restaurants and stayed at some of the best places (This is a toss-up.  I've stayed at a Holiday Inn and then the next week was at 5-star Manor in England or the Ritz (literally)).  Everything is always paid for, no matter what.  The amount of time on the road was variable; anywhere from 20% of the year and up to 90%.  You never know, because that's just how professional consulting works.  It's both work content and location dependent.  In summary, was I glad I did it?  Yes.  It was a once in a lifetime experience, accelerated my career by bounds that are difficult to measure, and gave me many lifelong memories.  But, it's your life (almost literally).  You are your work.  Almost every relationship I had in my life suffered for it.  I would find it difficult to going back to it, but I don't need to; I gave it what was needed and took what I needed to get to where I wanted to be.  Edit:  I'm working as a systems engineer now, and are applying many of the skills that I did previously, but instead of handing over my recommendations and saying, ""Best of luck"" (not always the case in my previous work, but mostly), I get to help manage the change and ensure the work is accomplished.  For my original description, keep in mind that I was a consultant; So, I would go in hot-and-heavy with full top-down managerial support and knock shit out (I was crazy expensive, so I typically had carte blanche access to anything whenever I needed it...mas o menos.).  Now, not so much.  I have to pace the progress according to availability of the people involved, and the politics has a much heavier reign on my latitude.  It's a completely different pace of work, but that is perfectly fine (The transition was a little ruff, though.  I was a turbo engine, rocketing through a business.  Now, they constantly have to reign me in, and let me know to cool my jets (just recently started)).  I truly felt guilty about working an 8-hour day, like I was shirking my work (I'm getting over that though :)"
math,3ds4zd,thenumber0,8,Sun Jul 19 20:48:41 2015 UTC,"This varies by location.  In Chicago, I had a fairly easy time transitioning from a B.S. in mathematics to software development—near San Francisco, this transition would likely be even easier.  I don't know if there are really so many ""math-based"" jobs, but there are many employers who understand that mathematical understanding is general—there is an old saying, a bit derogatory towards programmers, that it is easier to teach a mathematician to program than to teach a programmer how to think.  Mathematics itself, particularly at the bachelor's level, is not likely to be directly useful in any vocation.  Rather, you should try to come across as smart, eager, and willing/able to learn anything.  Choose a field that you want a future in.  Future you will be glad you did."

math,3ds4zd,thenumber0,3,Sun Jul 19 10:30:56 2015 UTC,"There were a number of things.  One important thing to remember is that a person only needs to find one job, so even if you are rejected by 99% of companies, all that means is that you need to apply to 100 companies, not that you won't find a job.  What I did was find a small company that was started by graduates of my alma mater, convince them I was smart and flexible, and demonstrate that I could learn programming.  Specifically, after my interview I spent some hours researching C#, the language they were mostly developing in, and sent them an application that competently implemented one of my interview questions in an amusing way.  This didn't require any knowledge that I couldn't Google, but it showed them that I was proactive and had the capacity to learn things I didn't already know.  After that, I was hired on a provisional salary.  I was paid an adequate (barely) salary, with the understanding that if, after six months, I had demonstrated that I was a fully productive member of the company, I would be given a retroactive raise to a fair salary.  They honored the agreement after I took initiative on a minor development project.  Even if they hadn't respected me as a developer, the experience and resumé-building was enough to quickly get me another higher-paying job at a consulting firm after one year of work.  I chose that job specifically because they had a strong training program, and I wanted to keep quickly advancing my career.  After another year, I moved to San Francisco (for some personal reasons, and some professional ones) and joined a startup.  By then, job-hunting was straightforward; I was no longer pretending to be a software developer, I was a software developer.    Maybe it's not immediately obvious how to apply this example to a general situation, in a general country, but I think that a ""fake it 'til you make it"" attitude is well-suited to mathematics majors.  A bachelor's degree in pure math is not a proof of any concrete skills (this is slightly less true for applied math), but it is proof that you can understand difficult things.  The best advice that I can give easily, without further information, is to make use of that badge of honor to ""get your foot in the door"" of a career that you have a serious interest in pursuing long-term.  Prioritize companies that are willing to train you, so that your value continues to increase.  Some employers may pay you just to research mathematics—the NSA, Google, and Microsoft come to mind.  But there may not be enough such positions to rely upon.  Especially early in your career, you should focus on discovering what companies value, and learning to provide it, rather than staying narrow and hoping to find companies that can profit from your skillset."

math,3ds4zd,thenumber0,3,Sun Jul 19 11:21:05 2015 UTC,"By writing them a program.  The program demonstrated the logic behind one of their interview challenge questions, which was an extra layer of suck-up.  I interviewed during the week, learned C# immediately after, and sent them the program over the weekend.  I'm not usually such a go-getter, but I wanted to make the job a sure thing, and it never hurts to pick up new career skills.  In the long run, I had to learn in a much more serious way.  I did my best to ensure that there were always people to teach me, but the business world is different from school: ultimately, you have to take responsibility for you, and waiting to be told how to proceed will only get you so far."

It relied on some way of encoding card values that allowed someone to send information without looking like information was being sent.  In the interview, they basically described the process and asked if I could figure out what was going on.  This is a nice advantage that math majors have when going into software development: many standard interview questions for software developers are really just math problems."

Another mathematical method that I use a lot in my work is formal verification.  The math there is computational logic, i.e., automated theorem proving.  Basically you can convert computer programs into logical formulae and pose queries about them (""is it possible that statement #3 ever divides by zero?"").

European doctoral programs only take those with masters, because there is typically little to no coursework involved in a european doctoral program (whereas in the US it is typical that the first two years have lots of coursework, effectively making up the gap between the masters brought into a european doctoral program and the bachelors brought into a US doctoral program)."

math,3dudds,Williamboyles,2,Sun Jul 19 15:50:05 2015 UTC,"Based on what you are saying, I would guess it is because triangle numbers are more likely to be a multiple of 6 than a randomly selected number ( 1/2 are even, and 2/3 are multiples of 3). Then your hypotenuse contains 1/3 numbers that are 1 mod 6, which will account for some of the discrepancy (I havent seen how large it is)."
math,3dudds,SolidCoal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:25:30 2015 UTC,"This is interesting. What is weird about you observation is that there seem to be a lot more prime numbers for T(n)+1 than T(n)-1. In fact the only numbers that are prime and T(n)-1 are 2 and 5 (I think). Also, I did not want to ask this in my original post until I had a better understanding, but I also looked(but did not write code relating to) at the gaps. At least for up until 211, no prime gap is larger than 3, and the first 3 prime gaps is from 79 to 137. The pattern for the gaps(wiht zeroes being no gap) is: 0,1,0,2,0,2,0,3,2,0...

If n odd, n-1 is even so the factorization as integers is (n-1)/2 * (n+2). When n is larger than 3, this realizes T(n)-1 as a product of two integers that are both larger than 1, so T(n)-1 isn't prime."

Every diagonal has a guaranteed nonzero fraction of numbers to not be prime. The first diagonal (hypotenuse) is the only one that doesn't have these guaranteed composites, so more primes should be there.  For a row, you'll  get all numbers of the form n (n+1)/2 +A where A goes from 1 to n+1 (I think). This means you will not have a prime whenever A and n or n+1 (depending on the row) are not coprime.

math,3dt0oi,topologyisfun,41,Sun Jul 19 04:16:50 2015 UTC,"I know a few of these people (mostly Canadians) actually. Pretty much every one of them put thousands of hours into solving math problems over the course of several years. Here's a blog post by Evan Chen, who got gold at the IMO.   Relevant quote: ""In 2011, JMO #5 took me two hours. In 2012, the same problem took me 30 seconds and SL 2011 G4 took me two hours. Today, SL 2011 G4 takes me about five minutes and IMO 2011 #6 took me seven hours. It would not have been a good use of my time in 2011 to spend several hundred hours on IMO #6.""  This is representative of the learning process.   I think every aspiring mathematician should learn to solve IMO-level problems eventually, it's like learning lots of difficult etudes as a musician. It's not so hard compared to coming up with new ideas in the course of your work (and brand new ideas are rarer than you think even at the research level) because all the ideas that go into solving IMO problems are old, they're mostly ideas that someone hit upon for the first time in the 1700s or 1800s. It also gets A LOT easier to solve these problems as you mature mathematically, and this happens naturally just by doing more math.   As a mathematician, you'll often need to prove an IMO-difficulty lemma, say, somewhere in the course of writing a paper, although of course you won't have to face the time constraints of the actual IMO. The time constraints aren't too important in research. Remember that it took Tim Gowers at least an hour and a half to solve an IMO problem 1, which is probably longer than it would take the average gold medalist, and that it took Terry Tao about seven hours to solve an IMO problem 6 (although he was preoccupied with other stuff during that time). Both Gowers and Tao are former IMO competitors, but the problems have gotten harder since their day.  Remember that the given solution is almost never the only solution, and don't stress too much about solving problems. A lot of math people get a complex about whether they have the natural ability to solve this stuff, but I swear there are like <100 tricks that are used to solve every contest problem ever. When these standard tricks don't show up, almost everyone (except the lucky few who happen upon an original idea that works in the given time or who have seen a rare trick that works, often in a paper somewhere) gets #rekt. [Personal aside: I distinctly remember the first time I stopped seeing IMO contestants as magicians. It was when I saw the country results for the 2011 IMO P2, the famous ""windmill"" problem, which did not really involve standard tricks in its solution. It wasn't supposed to be the hardest problem on the first day of the contest, but even very good teams uniformly did poorly on it. You can see this at this link.]   Example of a trick: if you have a Diophantine equation, try reducing mod various things, usually mod prime powers. For example, x2 + y2 = 403 where x and y are integers has no solutions (although you can see this more directly) because perfect squares can only be congruent to 0 or 1 mod 4 and any linear combination of two 0's and 1's mod 4 won't be congruent to 403 = 3 (mod 4) (because 0 + 0 = 0 (mod 4), 1 + 1 = 2 (mod 4), 0 + 1 = 1 (mod 4), and 1 + 0 = 1 (mod 4)).   Of course, IMO problems are much more complicated, but the average problem 1 or problem 2 (or 4 or 5) will basically involve a sequence of like 5 or 6 tactics like this. Problems 3 and 6 involve rarer tricks, but once you master the more common tricks you can learn about these by browsing AoPS a lot, or by reading slightly more challenging books like Problems from the Book or even Putnam and Beyond. The same advice applies to other contests, of course, like the Putnam at the university level.  Happy solving!  P.S. If I ever start feeling tired of a difficult contest problem, I often try to read an actual math paper or to do some real research. This usually makes the problem at hand feel like a welcome relief. ;)"

math,3dt0oi,AngelTC,11,Sun Jul 19 14:01:21 2015 UTC,"As an aspiring mathematician and also a lover of imo problems, I've got to say that they are not just clever tricks. Sometimes when I'm pondering over an IMO problem my mind wanders to different places and starts asking all kinds of questions. This happens especially in combinatorics problems.   They improve your problem solving skills. You learn to observe familiar patterns in new places (not just patterns found at imo level). Seriously attempting these problems is especially helpful to younger math lovers : the typical high school student is used to problems that take at most 10 minutes to solve. He / she learns to concentrate for a longer period of time. It's really a relief to tackle these problems in comparison to tedious computational questions usually found in tests.  Most of all, they keep your brain sharp. This is what one of my professors said. He's about 50 and his area of work is really theoretical. So for him solving these problems is a stimulant ; just an interesting puzzle."

Arguably the closest you can get to this is the Art of Problem Solving wiki and forums, but really you should look at several different books in addition to that. Some of the canonical titles are:   The Art and Craft of Problem Solving by Paul Zeitz. Zeitz was coach of the 1994 USA ""dream team"", the only full-sized team to get an overall perfect score at the IMO. His book consists of exposition about certain topics with detailed, well-motivated solutions followed by exercises. It is not to be confused with the Art of Problem Solving series, which is less advanced. This is good for getting your first taste of olympiad math. Problem-Solving Strategies by Arthur Engel. Engel was leader of the German IMO team for a while in the '70s and '80s. This book has relatively short sections written at a level slightly above that of The Art and Craft of Problem Solving. It also has a lot of exercises you won't find elsewhere, so it's great for training specific skills. Problems from the Book and Straight from the Book by Titu Andreescu and Gabriel Dospinescu. Andreescu was coach of the US IMO team for a while, and Dospinescu has also trained math contestants. These two books are more recent, but they've already acquired the reputation of classics. They cover more advanced topics than the previous two books and even contain some problems that were only solved in the 1900s (very recent for math contest--type problems). They teach useful contest techniques that you probably can't find discussed elsewhere (except on the internet, now that the books have come out). Also, the math they contain is truly beautiful, above and beyond the usual level of math competitions. These are truly amazing books that show the path to post-contest math.   But there are tons of good contest prep books. Terry Tao's first ever book, titled Solving Mathematical Problems: A Personal Perspective, is pretty neat. The Putnam training book Putnam and Beyond by Razvan Gelca and Titu Andreescu is fantastic and includes many tricks you won't see elsewhere, although some of them involve university-level math that's not necessary or even useful for the IMO. (In general, Andreescu's books are good. There are many of them, some of which are specific to certain areas of math, like number theory or functional equations.) I'm gleefully awaiting Evan Chen's upcoming geometry book.  There are also plenty of olympiad handouts online, many of which were made by recent IMO contestants. Evan Chen's recommendations page has some good ones.  Hope that helps!"

She spent hours on the internet every day just reading the AoPS forums and solving past USAMO and IMO problems, because she thought it was fun.   I qualified for the AIME, and that took a decent amount of practice.. at least a few hours every week doing practice tests. I've also been doing math competitions since like 4th grade. However, this girl didn't have any exposure to competitive math until 9th grade, and made it to the AIME without any practice at all!  What I'm trying to say is that the kids who make it to this high a level obviously have passion for the subject, and prepare a TON in order to be as good as they are.

One semester I decided to sign up for a class that involved preparing for the putnam examination. We would meet once a week and just try to solve problems, one week we focused on the pidgeonhole principle, the next week on parity arguments, etc. I'm 95% confident I never solved or had worthwhile progress any of the practice problems we studied. When I first took the putnam after this class, I got a 0. The next year I took the same class and just kept failing at solving things but I would make progress here or there on a problem maybe once every two weeks, and we were given like 10 problems every class. The second time I took the putnam, I got a Z+ score. It really boils down to just failing enough times and getting exposed to tons of different tricks. Through this experience and exposure you will learn to recognize different patterns and familiar themes. But it's a whole skillset on it's own, to be able to recognize these things. So you have to practice."
math,3dt0oi,avoiding_my_thesis,12,Sun Jul 19 04:57:45 2015 UTC,"I was good friends with someone who earned two gold medals at the IMO.  My understanding is that he worked, from start to finish, every single problem from the IMO since it began in 1959.  This is harder than it sounds, because many of those problems likely required days to process, and it is difficult to get good feedback without a supportive community.  However, it conveys a simple truth: you are not born with this kind of skill, it is something that you carve into your flesh, day by day.  I was second-tier, and even I worked my proverbial fingers to the bone practicing.  My greatest success on a competition followed a two-week period during which I began each day by working a previous year's competition from start to finish under test conditions.  On the day of the exam, it was just business as usual, down to my choice of pencil and my scratch paper management.  The results were so impressive that I still include them on my resumé almost 15 years later.  A more difficult question than ""How do they get good?"" is ""How do they learn to care so much?""  For me, community was essential—attending math circle and constantly interacting with people my age but far above my level was humbling, essential, and formative.  EDIT: I should add that I was competitive before there were strong internet resources for this sort of thing.  It is probably much easier now to reach a competitive level on one's own, but at the very least one should have a supportive online community, and some top-tier books."
math,3dt0oi,Quizbowl,7,Sun Jul 19 07:37:36 2015 UTC,"This answer resonates strongly with my experience.  There's a great sense of camaraderie among the US team members and the Canadian team members (and between the two sets of team members, because you often get Americans joining the Canadian team or Canadians going to school in America---the latter was the case for Alex Song, the guy who came top of the IMO hall of fame this year). It causes North American IMO contestants (and their other math contest friends) to have a lot of traits in common outside of math. A couple of examples:   They all have a trolly sense of humour. For example, every year the Canadians bring a plush toy moose, dubbed ""Canmoo"", to the competition and use it as a mascot of sorts. One American contestant once rewrote Romeo and Juliet in l33tspeak. It's common for people to read things like Homestuck that express a similar sense of humour. I think this sort of humour is actually present in a big part of the younger generation of mathematicians more generally. They often like to play the same games, and these tend to be kind of intellectually stimulating. You often get computer games like Dwarf Fortress or Kingdom of Loathing and card games like Gong Zhu (a.k.a. Chinese Hearts). [I learned to play the latter from an IMO competitor and another friend of ours who also does contests. The IMO competitor learned it from another IMO competitor at Winter Camp. It's like the best card game evar.]   It's hard to separate these traits from the culture of people who engage in intellectually stimulating pastimes in general, or from the culture of aspiring young mathematicians, or from the culture of Usenet participants, interestingly enough (which has had a bearing on internet culture ever since), but I think there's something there. You can get a sense of it by browsing the AoPS forums for a while.  Having a mathematical community is absolutely essential. Math olympiads an Eastern European invention from the time of communism. The first IMO, in 1959, consisted (IIRC) entirely of Eastern Bloc countries. The time of communism was a dark one in a lot of ways, but one of the good things about it was the culture of technical competence that pervaded these countries (studying to be an engineer there was very common), and so everyone was decently good at math and science. In the US you get pockets of the same, often in big cities or college towns, and this is where you get lots of IMO contestants, although with the internet it's easier than ever to become one if you live elsewhere.  This sort of veered off topic from your original answer, but I wanted to get it all out."

So the idea is the maximize your bag of tricks and combine them with your ingenuity and try a new, hard problem."
math,3dt0oi,hungry_koala,4,Sun Jul 19 04:43:19 2015 UTC,"I qualified for USAMO twice, though was never good enough to move beyond that. I started in between 7th and 8th grade, it took me 1 year to qualify for Mathcounts Nationals, and 1 year to narrowly miss the USAMO cutoff (was 1 AIME problem away). Didn't do well the following year, but qualified for USAMO the next two. My best Putnam performance was my first year in college, and declined after that since I got more rusty over time. I'm from a non-competitive region, so Art of Problem Solving was my main resource.  The first two years were spent going through the first two volumes of Art of Problem Solving, participating in the forums, doing practice tests, and doing competitions like AMC12, AIME, ARML, USAMTS, AoPS mock tests. AoPS has done a great job of democratizing the math scene by giving access to people who don't have local resources like math circles or strong math teams. I spent hours every day those first two years practicing or learning theory and tricks. I'd say it takes about 2+-1 year to get to a level where you can qualify for USAMO and maybe even solve 1 or 2 questions on USAMO, but to get the point where the first 1 or 2 questions on USAMO can be done in a few minutes so you have enough time to solve the rest of them, and can do it consistently with speed, takes years of additional practice. The people who are USAMO winners and IMO team members have probably put in a good 4-7 years of hard practice and over 10,000 hours.  Solving Olympiad problems is a matter of building requisite insight. The problems cover geometry (euclidean, projective, inversive), number theory, inequalities, probability, algebra, trigonometry, complex numbers, combinatorics and a few other subjects; calculus, statistics, and higher (undergraduate+graduate) mathematics are not required, though they can certainly be useful. Some of these topics aren't covered in high school or even many undergraduate curriculums. There's a kinda standard corpora of theorems and tricks and problem construction ideas that are common in contest problems, ranging from necessary even at the lowest level competitions to fairly advanced or obscure. However, combining these techniques to solve Olympiad problems is non-trivial and requires experience and insight. There is a kinda meta-gaming in that, unlike research problems, Olympiad problems have a solution of an expected level of difficulty, and there is kinda a limit to the breadth of problems that can be proposed, so familiarity with lots of problems is definitely helpful. At the same time, Olympiad contest writers must think of newer problems which aren't as easily solved by knowing similar past problems, so the meta-game moves forward over time--the present is always the time where the most past problems are available to students to study. The best problem-solvers have built great depth and breadth in the techniques, theorems, and problems they have in the back of their minds over many years of practice. They're self-motivated to do well and very passionate and generally start early, but there have been some people who have started later who have done very well."

It starts out in the lower classes, when they can attend extra school hours, which were held by some excellent math teachers. Later on, as the difficulty rises, these 'boot camps' are outsourced into our local university, where for years several doctors have been in charge of getting the students MO/math skills to the next level. It's a long lasting bond in the interest of supporting students that do really well in math in general, not only in MOs.    With all these years of extra training they then of course know a whole lot of nifty 'tricks'. F.e. I now heard several times that the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means is one of more often used theorems to go for at lower MO levels. But besides 'regular' theorems you usualy would learn in university, they are trained towards a high level of creativity, that you often need for the kind of problems in MOs."

math,3dsos1,lordoftheshadows,2,Sun Jul 19 05:26:31 2015 UTC,The easiest way to do it is just track the user's average speed over the course of a couple of seconds and if it is above a certain amount (you can do latency testing yourself; I don't have a clue as to what it would be) then you can ban them or do what ever else you want.  You have discovered the blight of letting the user to anything.  Don't trust the users; they always lie.  Unfortunately the solution listed above is relatively easy to beat by staggering the increase or by the users discovering what the thresh hold is.  To beat the users (because that is the goal after all) I'd start by gathering data on speed modifications caused by latency (get the data yourself to avoid having the cheaters as part of the control data set).  With the data you can see what is normal for latency and such.  With that you can create a system that checks how the latency modifies the speed.  If over a long period of time (long being subjective) all of the assumed latency spikes are in the same direction you can safely ban the user.  You would have to fiddle with the numbers to get it to work right but that test looks only for significance not for the size of the effect.  The test finds if there is an effect but it doesn't care about the size of the effect which keeps it from banning users who happen to experience latency issues even if they have extreme ones.

Here's what I've heard: first of all, p-adic line integration is a tricky thing to ask for, since you're dealing with totally disconnected spaces -- what is a path between two points? We think of a path as a continuous map from [0,1] into your space, but we can't have that here, since paths as defined are connected. The proper setting then isn't p-adic manifolds but something called a rigid analytic space. This is where you can hope for an analogous theory of complex analysis (analytic continuation for example). Integration can be done ""locally"" but it's hard to do better than this Coleman integration, whatever it is, accomplishes this. I guess there isn't a residue calculus but you do have stuff like linearity of the integral, additivity, and the fundamental theorem of calculus.   Unfortunately this is about as good as I can do.

math,3dssoa,Umbrall,2,Sun Jul 19 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"Sure! Here is a relevant MO post for starters. This is a pretty specific example but the general theory is very abstract.  There is less structure for generalized translation operators than groups. From what I recall there are three or four conditions:  Given a set of continuous functions S on a set X and y in X, the operator Ty (T depends on elements of X) on S is a translation operator if:   Ty(a f(x) + b g(x)) = a Tyf(x) + b Tyg(x), i.e. T is linear. There is a fixed y in X such that for all f in S, Tyf(x) = f(x). This is akin to having an identity element in a group. Defining F(y,x) = Tyf(x), then Tz_y F(y,x) = Ty_x F(z,x) (where Tz_y F(y,x) means translate in the y variable from y to z). This is sort of like a commutativity condition, I think. In loose terms, I think this says that if you translate from x to y, then y to z, it's the same as translating from x to z, then z to y. This agrees with how we usually think about translations - if you translate from your starting point of x by y, then translate by z, it's the same distance as if you translated from your starting point of x by z, then by y. Tyf is continuous.   This is kind of like forcing the usual notions of a group not on the set X, but on S. There's a pretty strong connection with hypergroups but I haven't studied that in any meaningful way.  It seems like a lot of the applications of generalized translation operators comes about in similar ways to the MO post I linked above.  You have an integral operator and you want to come up with a convolution theorem, so you have to come up with a notion of generalized translation that plays nicely with your integral operator. The way to do this is by considering the eigenoperator for the (integral) kernel of the integral operator and setting up a PDE very similar to the one in the MO post.  E.g., if you have an integral operator with integral kernel k(xy) and k is the eigenfunction of some differential operator D, then you set up the equation D(x)u = D(y)u with u(x,0) = f(x), then solve. The u that you get is the generalized translation of f and you proceed onwards from there.  I think it's a nice analytic companion to the harmonic analysis notion of translation operators and it actually subsumes the usual notion. However since the theory is so far reaching, it's pretty hard and there doesn't seem to be a lot of really deep results."

math,3dsn6k,Gwodmajmu,3,Sun Jul 19 01:52:55 2015 UTC,"I think you're asking the general question ""are generating functions useful?""  The answer is yes. Even in simple problems where generating functions don't seem necessary, the use of a computer aid like Wolfram Alpha makes finding the coefficients pretty easy. For example, finding the number of ways to make change for $1.20 can be solved through other means; however, generating functions are so intuitive that I typically just write them down, plug into Wolfram Alpha, and find the coefficient of x120 without thinking further.  Now what can generating functions offer that's new? A closed form representation can be highly useful; the most common example is that 1 + x + x2 + ... = 1/(1-x). Now using calculus, we can differentiate and integrate functions that we know to produce new ones. In that way, a problem we're solving may suddenly yield solutions to other problems. They are useful for solving recurrence relations. They allow problems to be generalized more easily (for example, how many ways to count change? how many ways to count change when order does not matter?).  It's almost a backwards way of doing things. Instead of starting with a problem and solving it, you can start with a function, compute its series expansion, and find a formula for its coefficients. Then you think of a problem which the coefficients represent and you've solved that problem!"

Define some function p: D_n -> Z, so that p(d_i) is some integer. We want to count how many elements of D_n have p(d) = t for all t possible. We could do this directly or look at the coefficients of the generating function    [; F_n = \sum_{d \in D_n} q^{p(d)} ;]   My question is if there is any added benefit (of ease or technique of counting, or extra information about G or D) in studying the generating function or is it just another way if stating the problem?  One thing I can think of is that letting q=1 in F_n gives us the size of D_n, so F_n is a q-analogue if |D_n|.

math,3dsn6k,eruonna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:00:01 2015 UTC,"In general, yes, the idea of generating functions exists for a reason, and that reason is because it is sometimes helpful in solving problems. Whether or not to use it for a particular problem, and how to use it, will depend on the problem.  The problem you have stated, counting multisets, basically, does have a nice solution in generating functions. But it also has a nice direct solution. Which one is preferable is partly down to taste and partly down to what you want to do with the solution."
math,3dsn6k,eruonna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:16:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer, but I'm aware of the utility of generating functions, and I'm not interested in this problem specifically, it was just an example. I'll try to restate my question.  Suppose you have an object G_n that depends on a parameter n and admits some set of objects D_n = {d_1, d_2, ..., d_k}. Define some function p: D_n -> Z, so that p(d_i) is some integer. We want to count how many elements of D_n have p(d) = t for all t possible. We could do this directly or look at the coefficients of the generating function    [; F_n = \sum_{d \in D_n} q^{p(d)} ;]   My question is if there is any added benefit (of ease or technique of counting, or extra information about G or D) in studying the generating function or is it just another way if stating the problem?  One thing I can think of is that letting q=1 in F_n gives us the size of D_n, so F_n is a q-analogue if |D_n|. This could be interesting, but what info would letting q=2 or q=-1 or some other number give us?  Another question I have is if the roots of F_n could ever tell us anything about our object G_n or set D_n?"

math,3ds7i8,infernvs666,6,Sun Jul 19 01:11:07 2015 UTC,"I am writing this as someone who spent a great deal of time as an undergraduate, a graduate student and a PhD Mathematician trying to understand Galois Theory.  I think I finally understand it now after far too many years trying to bash it into my own thick skull.  I am not the only one like this.  I ran into a very distinguished senior algebraist at a very well-known institution, a Fellow of the AMS no less, who confessed to having the same problems when he was young.  He was lucky and was able to clear his problems up early in his career.  I wish I had been so lucky.  I honestly think there are a lot of people like us who just don't admit it.  It is a field that can be incredibly subtle.  You can be learning it and it all makes sense and then, all of a sudden, you find you have become lost and you will have no idea where you fell off the trail.  My reaction, when this happened to me several times, was to go back to the beginning, retrace my steps until I came to a point that I did not understand completely, and then work hard on that until I understood it.  There are a lot of these points.   So, with that in mind, here is my advice.  Get some good references.  Rotman is very good. You can find it here.  Stewart is also very good.  That’s here.  Search Google for Galois Theory for Beginners.  You will find some decent stuff there.  If you are moderately sophisticated and can handle Kaplansky's elegant but sparse style, try Fields and Rings.  But these are only the beginning.    A lot of references stick to Galois Theory in characteristic zero. (I think Kaplansky does characteristic p but am not sure of the others.)  That makes the subject too easy because the characteristic zero case makes all fields separable.  It is only in characteristic p where inseparable fields show up.  For that, really, the only good reference that exists – in my not-very-humble-but-undoubtedly-correct-opinion - is by McCarthy.  (I would recommend buying the paperback since it’s cheap and I really like to make extensive notes in my books.)     Stay away from Artin’s book.  When I was an undergraduate I knew people who were absolutely enamored of it but it has the problem that it starts by considering a field, a group of automorphisms of that field and the fixed subfield of that group.  This makes all extensions normal and that’s not how problems come at you in the real world.  Finally, keep at it.  And if at first you don’t succeed, try again.  And again.  And again.    It’s an important subject and knowledge of it is worthwhile because the ideas are so beautiful that people keep trying to copy them to other Mathematical areas.  If you know it well, you will have a real leg up on algebra in grad school.  tl;dr:  Go back and read this.  It is worth reading."
math,3ds7i8,MadPat,2,Sun Jul 19 02:10:24 2015 UTC,"As someone with extensive experience in Galois theory, can you provide some motivation for the subject at a non-introductory level?   What I mean is, while I do see the value in the insolvability of the quintic, and other basic results, most of the graduate level Galois theory seemed a  little pointless to me. (And I'm a group theorist, so it's not like I don't like algebra.) Many of the results just left me thinking, well, OK, but so what? Can you help me chase away this thought?"
math,3ds7i8,IAmVeryStupid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:17:28 2015 UTC,"I agree that a lot of the theorems that show up in the exposition of Galois theory seem somehow to be a jumble rather than a straightforward exposition of a theory.  However, the theory does have some interesting consequences.    First, the Feit-Thompson theorem says that any group of odd order is solvable.  So, if you have a polynomial P over a field k and P has splitting field K where G(K/k) has odd order, then the roots of P can be written as roots of elements of k.  (That's not a great statement of what is going on, but I think you can get the idea.  The roots of P can be arrived at by something akin to the quadratic or cubic formula.)    Galois Theory tells you lots about fields and extensions.  For example, if K is Galois over k, then K is simple.  I.e., K = k(alpha) for some alpha.    Galois theory tells you lots about finite fields.  For example, that's where you learn that for every prime p and every integer n >= 1, there is a unique field with pn elements and it is isomorphic to the field of roots of Xpn - X.      If you want to go into number theory, Galois theory provides some powerful tools.  McCarthy's book - the one I mentioned in the first post - has two chapters on field and Galois theory and the rest is on valuation theory and Dedekind fields ... which I know nothing about.    There are applications of finite field theory to algebraic coding theory and cryptography.  You can find out about them in Mullen and Mummert.      If you think cryptography is lots of fun - I do - look into Trappe and Washington - Introduction to Cryptography and its exposition of Rijndael.  I hope this helps."
math,3ds7i8,MadPat,3,Sun Jul 19 20:29:36 2015 UTC,"I'll second the recommendation of Dummit and Foote.  I taught myself the basics of field theory and Galois theory from that book over ten years ago, and these remain my strongest subjects to this day.  That said, your question—like many on this subreddit—lacks context.  For example, you will get very different advice if you are preparing for a graduate Galois theory course as opposed to an undergraduate one.  Ideally, you would show us the syllabus of whatever course you're taking, so that we have a sense of what you're trying to get ready for.  My guess is that you're getting ready for a first course, in which case Dummit and Foote is excellent (IMHO).  Avoid texts with a discussion of infinite Galois extensions, which are interesting but usually unnecessarily complicated for a first course.  Shore up your understanding of group theory, particularly permutation groups.  If you are not comfortable with permutation groups and basic field theory, Galois theory will be an uphill battle."

Two warnings, though:   Calculus is a subject where it's possible to get straight A's without understanding anything, because after you've established a few rules you can just calculate without actually thinking about what any of it means.  Speaking from personal experience, this can seriously come back to bite you later in life.  Make very sure that you understand at a gut level why the fundamental theorem of calculus is true; where the definitions of limits, integrals, and derivatives come from; why l'Hospital's rule holds, and so forth. Self-study works well for subjects like algebra and calculus, where hundreds of new textbooks come out every year written from every possible angle and all the explanation has been refined over centuries to make things flow as smoothly as possible.  Once you get closer to the cutting edge, though, often things are just sort of half-written down or presented in ways that makes self-study almost impossible, and you will be forced to learn by talking with people who already understand them.  If you're averse to attending lectures or going to office hours at that point, things can go sour quickly.  (Again, speaking from personal experience.)  If there are professors who seem interesting, go visit them in office hours from time to time.  Office hours aren't just for people begging for hints on the homework.

It just so happens that (most) humans have now settled on the same system which in English is called base ten, decimal or denary.  ... but even then that sentence doesn't contain enough information as to what 'ten' means. We know its meaning because of commonly accepted standards.  If a stranger from a far off place says he counts in base 'fez' you have no idea what it was any more than you would have if he goes on to write ""10"" for 'fez'. We're still missing the abstract concept that is the value of 'fez'.  Then he writes fez = 10 = :::::: and all becomes clear. ""Oh"", you say, ""you count in duodecimal!"" which is a word he doesn't understand.

math,3dtuif,wwf10,2,Sun Jul 19 12:11:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think an interest rate of 29% is insane by any means.  Suppose you loan out $100 to people at a rate of 29% annually.  Then every time they pay the loan back you receive $129.  How often do people have to repay their loans for you just to break even on this?  Well, you need 129p = 100, or in other words a 23% default rate or less, just to avoid losing money.  If you want to make a 7% return, then you'd need 129p = 107, or a default rate of 17% or lower.  If course, if someone's got a low credit score then you know that (1) they've probably defaulted on things in the past and (2) they're probably not in great financial shape.  So it is legitimately a gamble that ~80% of them are going to get you all your money back on time.  (I don't know anything about how repayment works on these sites, but of course in reality sometimes people make monthly payments and then default, meaning that you could accept a somewhat higher default rate.

This is not true for HS, but it is true for separable HS, which are all isometric to l2 . l2 on the other hand is a special case of L2 with the counting measure on the natural numbers. So, up to isometry (i.e. structure that interests us), seperable HS are straightforward generalisations of finite inner product spaces by choosing a countable basis and they are discrete L2 -fcts. Hence in your mind, everything can be replaced by infinite dimensional matrices, something which cannot be done in the uncountable case. Plus this helps a lot if you have working experience with L2 spaces. In addition, it gives you an idea what L2 fcts. over a non-countable measure space are:  a non-seperable HS.

An upper bound on the number of possible configurations of roads is therefore (25 )72, or ~10108. But each person can only have at most 15 roads, so another upper bound is (sum from i=1 to 15 of (72 choose i))4, which is ~1060. To calculate the actual sum we should replace all the terms (72 choose a)(72 choose b)(72 choose c)(72 choose d) that pop up with the multichoose, and Python tells me this gives around 1048 possible road configurations.  Then on the city/settlements you have essentially 8 things that can be placed in each spot instead of 4. Python tells me there are around 1035 city/settlement configurations, for a total of 1084 building configurations (84 not 83 because rounding.)  Multiplying by 19!*9! for the tile configurations, we get an upper bound of around 10107 total board configurations in Catan. And of course, the vast majority of these aren't reachable from any game (e.g. the buildings of the same color aren't connected).  TL;DR Catan has less board configurations than chess.  EDIT: okay, cards. There's 19 of each development card, 2 each of Monopoly/Road Building/Year of Plenty, 14 Soldiers, and 5 different victory cards. So the number of hands is (19+4 choose 4)4 * (14+4 choose 4) * (2+4 choose 4)3 * 45, which is around 1033, bringing our upper bound on Catan board+hand configurations to 10140.  Also, some of these positions have more than 2 players with over 10 points, which can't happen if you're playing to 10. If we discard positions with more than 1 players over 10 points from buildings alone, the upper bound drops only slightly to 10138. I expect a similar drop if we also discard card/board combinations with too many points. So it's looking like /u/SlipperyFrob was right, and there are less board configurations than chess but more board+card configurations."

Somebody else can probably do a very ballpark estimate though. My guess is that, with cards, Catan has more states, but without it has fewer. My intuition is that once you fix the initial state in Catan, the players don't have very many moves they can make (ignoring cards), but somehow need to make up 100 orders of magnitude of difference in number of game states. In a game with 30 rounds, that requires players have an average of a little over 20 possible moves (and that's ignoring the fact that some pairs od sequences of moves lead to the same game state). That's a very rough guess though."

But maybe a better informal description would be: primes are the integers that can't be broken down further, and that also contribute to a factorization.  For example, consider the number 30.  All of the following are true statements:  30 = 5*6 (this is true, but the 6 can be broken down more, so 6 is not prime)  30 = 5*2*3 (this is a product of primes)  30 = 5*1*2*1*1*3 (this is true, but the 1's don't make any contribution, and we don't need to write them)  We could define 1 to be prime if we wanted to. However, what would then happen is that we would have reason to sometimes talk about the primes greater than 1 (for instance, when discussing unique factorization). If ""prime greater than 1"" is a concept that comes up a lot, then we might want a name for just those primes, maybe ""promes"" or ""preems"" or something. But since it turns out to be useful to give a name to the ""primes"" greater than 1, we actually just call those by the term ""prime"" in the first place."

The neat thing about base 10 is that each decimal place represents a number that's one more than a multiple of 3 (and indeed a multiple of 9). 100 is one more than 99, which is a multiple of 3. 10 is one more than 9 which is a multiple of 3. 1 is one more than 0 which is a multiple of 3. And if you go in the other direction, to 1000, and 10000, and so on, you see that they're all one more than something that looks like 99...999 which is a multiple of 3.  Now when we look at divisibility by 3, effectively all the multiples of 3 ""don't matter"". What I mean by that is that if I have some number like 8, that's not divisible by 3. So if I add a multiple of 3, like 15, I get 15 + 8 = 23. And 23 is still not divisible by 3. Because 23 is made up of 15, which will divide evenly, and I still have this extra 8 which won't.  On the other hand if I have a number like 9 which is divisible by 3 and I add 15, then I get 24 which is still divisible by 3. Because 24 is made up of two parts, 15 and 9 which are both divisible by 3.   So what that means is, if I have a number, and I'm wondering if it's a multiple of 3, I can remove big complicated multiples of 3 that I can see and that won't change the answer, but it will make my life easier.  So if I have a number like 752, then I know that that's 700 + 50 + 2. And I know that 700 is literally, seven hundreds, or 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100. And all those are one more than a multiple of 3 as we saw before. So let's get rid of those multiples of 3 by subtracting them out, and that will give us the same answer. 100 - 99 + 100 - 99 + 100 - 99 + 100 - 99 + 100 - 99 + 100 - 99 + 100 - 99.  Each of those subtractions will give us 1, and there's 7 of them because we started with 7 in the hundreds place, so that's 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.  So 700 + 52 and 7 + 52 are either both divisible or both not divisible by 3 because all we've done is removed big multiples of 3, and that doesn't change the answer.  So let's look at the next digit, 5. 5 is in the tens place and represents 50, or 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10. Subtracting the multiples of 3, we see that this will have the same answer as 10 - 9 + 10 - 9 + 10 - 9 + 10 - 9 + 10 - 9 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.  so 700 + 50 + 2 has the same answer as 7 + 50 + 2 which has the same answer as 7 + 5 + 2, and 7 + 5 + 2 is the sum of the digits. This same procedure works for any other number of any length."

math,3dqfhj,DAT1729,3,Sat Jul 18 13:38:35 2015 UTC,"This type of thing also works for other bases; the idea is that in base b, b is congruent to 1 mod any factor of b-1. Thus, b ^ n for any positive integer n is congruent to 1 mod (factor of b-1). Thus, to find what (a1)b ^ (n1) + (a2)b ^ (n2) + (a3)b ^ (n3)+... is mod a factor of b-1, we can simply add up a1+a2+a3+... Since divisibility is whether or not a number is 0 mod another number, our trick works.  For example, say we had the base 11 number 84 and we wanted to see whether it was divisible by 2 or by 5. Since 8+4=12 which is divisible by 2, 84 base 11 is even, but since 12 is not divisible by 5, 84 base 11 is also not divisible by 5. Now lets change 84 base 11 to base 10. This gets us 92, which clearly is, as predicted, divisible by 2 but not by 5."

You can use geometric series as a toy example of analytic continuation (since [; (1-x) ^ {-1} ;] makes sense everywhere but [; 1+x + x^ 2 + \cdots ;] only makes sense for [; |x|<1 ;] ), then use unique factorization to explain the Euler Product:  [; \zeta(s) = \sum _ {n=1} ^ \infty \frac{1}{n^ s} =\prod_{p \mbox{ prime}} \left(1+\frac{1}{p^ s}+\frac{1}{p^ {2s}}+\cdots \right) ;]  for [;\Re(s) >1. ;] I then use the geometric series again (let [; x = 1/p^ s ;])  to simplify the Euler product:  [; \zeta(s) = \sum _ {n=1} ^ \infty \frac{1}{n^ s} =\prod_{p \mbox{ prime}} \left(1-\frac{1}{p^ s}\right) ^  {-1}. ;]  This provides the intuition that the Riemann Zeta Function has some relationship to the prime numbers. Furthermore, you can say that like the geometric series has a continuation to all [; x \in \mathbb{C} ;], [;\zeta(s);] enjoys a continuation to all [; s \in \mathbb{C}. ;]   From there you say that the zeros of [; \zeta(s) ;] encode information about the primes, and that's useful and interesting too. Say that the current best known zero-free region tells us that [; \pi(x), ;] the number of primes less than x, has the asymptotic estimate:  [; \pi(x) = \int _ 2 ^ x \frac{dt}{\log t}+O(xe^ {-c\sqrt{\log x }}) ;]   and so [; \pi(x) \sim x/\log x ;], but that with Riemann Hypothesis we can say   [; \pi(x) = \int _ 2 ^ x \frac{dt}{\log t}+O(\sqrt{x} \log x) ;]   which is a much stronger statement about the distribution of primes.   From there, you might mention that there are other L-functions, functions of the form  [; L(s) = \sum_ {n=1} ^ \infty  \frac{a(n)}{n^ s} ;]  where [; a(n) ;] may satisfy some nice properties, and that these too may have a Generalized Riemann Hypothesis attached to them that say all sorts of things.

math,3druj6,cbooty,4,Sat Jul 18 21:16:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm... that's not anything I've explicitly come across before but let's see if we can come up with something. I'll note that there is an entire field of applied mathematics/statistics related to validating a random model, but that's too big of a subject to get into here.  Let's define X as the random variable representing the output of your Monte Carlo model and we'll call the ""true"" value s and S will be the interval [s - a*s, s + a*s], where a is our relative width (a=.1 -> 10%). Define a new sequence of random variables Yi, each of which takes the value 1 if xi is in S and 0 otherwise (where xi is a particular realization of X). This is a Bernoulli trial, with probability of success equal to the integral of the PDF of X over the interval S.  Now, let's say you take N samples in your Monte Carlo trial. What you're calculating is the total number of successes observed, which implies that you are observing random process of Yi's, so by running your MC experiment and checking if the result falls in S at step i you're observing a realization of the corresponding random variable Yi. What you're calculating is the sum of all the realizations (1, 0, 1, 0 etc). Turns out the value of the sum of a sequence of Bernoulli trials is itself a random variable that is governed by the Binomial distribution. This conclusion requires some mild assumptions, but they're pretty weak and stuff that violates them is pretty uncommon.  So tl;dr is that what your calculating is a realization of a Binomial distribution, with n = number of Monte Carlo trials and p = (integral of p(X) over S). For modestly large number of Monte Carlo samples (like, 100) this is well-approximated by a normal distribution. There's a lot you can do with that knowledge, but on its own it's not hugely informative. Unfortunately there's not a simple ""it's called this"" answer as far as I'm aware."
math,3druj6,sandwichsaregood,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:06:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  This certainly helps getting me pointed in the correct direction.  I understand generating a series of Yi observations to see if an individual observation falls within interval S and determining cumulative probability of success from there.  So you mention ""there's a lot I can do with the knowledge but on its own it's not hugely informative"", can you expand on this?  Do you have any suggestions for next steps?  Basically, I'm looking to tune the model and my assumptions is that if p for one set of model inputs is higher than p for another, the model with highest p could be considered to work the best.  Also, any alternative suggestions you can think of to evaluate a MC model would also be helpful.  Again thanks for the very thorough explanation!"
math,3druj6,sandwichsaregood,2,Sun Jul 19 19:12:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok I see. What you want to do isn't model validation/verification- if I understand correctly you want to do one of two things:   Select the best model from a variety of different models. This is called model selection. Tune the parameters of a particular model so that it best reproduces some real-world data. This is typically called either data assimilation or data calibration.   Both of these are related in the sense that you're really trying to minimize the discrepancy between your model and the observed data, but what you're varying is different (the whole model versus the parameters of a specific model). By chance, this is actually my specific area of expertise but unfortunately both tasks are rather difficult and complicated.  The approach you're taking isn't a terrible first stab at it, but it's also not a very good one. The main issue is that the ""true"" final cost also needs to be treated as random variable. Yes, there was an actual specific final cost observed, but imagine for instance if the same project was repeated again. Even with the exact same initial parameters (location, time of year etc), it's quite unlikely that the final costs would be the same because of random confounding effects. Fitting just one data point is really dangerous, because you're not considering whether or not that point might be an outlier. The final costs of the project you picked might not be typical, for instance say a bolt of lightning struck and burned down one of the buildings while it was being built and that drove up construction costs. Basically, if you only fit to one data point without accounting for uncertainty, you should have very little confidence that the model will be valid at any other data point. In some sense this is what you're doing (except you're assuming a uniform distribution +/- 10%), but it needs to be treated differently.  A first-round improvement would be to account for uncertainty in the case you're looking at. The most basic assumption would be to assume that the final price is normally distributed, with mean = (the actual value you have) and a standard deviation that you'll have to determine by expert judgement. For instance if you're very confident that the given case is a very typical one, then you'd pick a standard deviation that is a relatively small fraction of the mean. If you're less certain, you pick a wider standard deviation. Intuitively (from the frequentist perspective), this means that if you did the whole construction over again a thousand times, what would you expect the distribution of the final costs to look like?  Now, what to do with that? Unfortunately, this is where stuff gets a bit too complicated for a reddit comment. I said ""from the frequentist perspective"" earlier, but this problem is much more natural in a Bayesian context (explanation) and is amenable to e.g. Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques.  The most basic variation would be to find some more data for similar construction projects and look at their final costs or perhaps ask some engineers (if you aren't one) to give some estimates of the possible range of cost variations for the project you do have. Then you'll want to construct an estimate for the distribution of the real cost you have (as I said, normally distributed in the simplest case, uniform is not a good idea because that's like saying ""it's impossible that the project could have had a cost that was < or > the observed final cost +/- 10% and everything between that was equally likely""). You then can compare your Monte Carlo distribution to the estimated distribution (perhaps by performing a distribution similarity test). Again though, there's always the danger that you're fitting your model to match this specific case and perhaps it's crap on other cases. That's where verification and validation comes into play, which is where you then try and test if your model that you tuned on one data set also works for other cases.  If you need some reading on this, I recommend Ralph Smith's ""Uncertainty Quantification: Theory, Implementation and Applications."" It's not terribly expensive and is probably the most digestible text on the subject I know of. $74 and 30% off if you're a SIAM member (which is free for students)."

I do expect to have a few more projects to use to backtest the model shortly (once they're finished) and although I think I have some reading to do, it seems the additional data points should go a long way to validating the model.  The only issue I see is instead of having multiple final costs <I>for a particular project</I>, I will have a single final cost for <I>multiple projects</I>.  The model will predict a different estimated distribution of costs for each project, but the shape of the curves will differ based on project characteristics.  Anyway, I'm sure I can hack my way through this with the reading material you suggested but again, thanks for the help!"

Just to be perfectly general about it, you can represent any finite group (and lots of infinite groups) as a group of matrices under the operation of matrix multiplication. To do so as simply as possible (although there are lots of ways), just use permutation matrices, noting by Cayley's Theorem that every group is equivalent to a permutation group. Now just pick any abelian group and you have that many matrices all of which commute pairwise.  To prove that no matrices satisfy AB - BA = I, consider a function on matrices called the trace. The trace of a matrix, Tr(M), is just the sum of its diagonal entries. Interestingly, this function satisfies Tr(A+B) = Tr(A) + Tr(B) and Tr(AB) = Tr(BA). The reason for the first should be clear: The diagonal entries of A+B are just the sum of the respective diagonal entries of A and B. The second holds for similar but more complicated reasons. The diagonal entries of AB and BA are both sums of products of particular entries of A and B; a product (a_i,j b_k,l ) will appear as part of the sum Tr(AB) iff i = l (so that we are in a diagonal entry) and j = k (so that they match up in the product-sum of the entry). Of course, the same conditions (for reversed reasons) have to hold for (b_k,l a_i,j ) to be in the sum Tr(BA). Having established these properties, we know that Tr(AB - BA) = Tr(AB) - Tr(BA) = 0 (because Tr(AB) = Tr(BA)). On the other hand, Tr(I) = n (the dimension of the matrix). Therefore, the diagonal entries of I have a different sum than those of AB - BA, and so at least one entry must be different. Therefore, AB - BA cannot equal I."

You could argue that it's not repeated since no finite product will ever be the same as an exponential. It shows up really commonly in power sets, and in some theoretical CS type theory，but that's harder to keep rigorous. We can use things in exponentials that we can't assign values to, and which certainly aren't natural numbers.  Of course the whole thing is just a matter of what people say they do, like assigning addition and multiplication to different operations so multiplication isn't just iterated addition."
math,3dqgtv,Umbrall,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"You are discussing a more general context than I was.  If you want your definition of exponential to include, say, functionspaces (what we denote by BA in set theory), then we're working over a semiring. And one with many special properties a general ring doesn't have.   Interestingly, exponentiation in this case is still repeated ""multiplication""... where the meaning of multiplication changes to an (indexed) cartesean product.  In this setting, the noncommutativity can be seen because of the inherent distinction between the domain and codomain of a function. The set BA is the functions of type A → B, and swapping the roles of A and B produces the set of functions which take the opposing elements as inputs (resp. outputs).  The two notions coincide up to some weak notion of equivalence in very special cases. But they are different enough you can't really treat them both as the same phenomenon."

I do find that concrete examples like 3.20 are usually written in a rushed way, but I found the main, more involved proofs are usually includes enough details.  On a side-note, the necessary details for proving monotonicity of exponentiation can be proved using exercises in chapter 1.

However, I always thought it was rigorous, so I took a quick look at your complaints.  On 3.20a: You're right that his argument requires the monotonicity of exponentiation, but there's something more fundamental that should be bothering us: What's the actual definition of bp ? That's non-trivial, and for this we have to go back to exercise 6 from Chapter 1. Once we've absorbed that exercise, the basic laws of exponentiation (including monotonicity) follow easily from similar arguments.  So Rudin is expecting you to read the statement of 3.20a, be shocked, think ""what the hell does exponentiation even mean for a general positive real p?"", go back, find the definition, and get comfortable with exponentiation. I'm not saying Rudin doesn't sin here. But it's a different sin, and I think a more forgivable sin, than sweeping non-trivial propositions under the rug. He's expecting you to realize the necessity of the chapter 1 exercise. He should have mentioned it here, yes. But that omission doesn't mean he's being unrigorous.  As for 3.33d, this seems fine. To prove that ""the test gives no information [about convergence]"", you just find examples of series that do and do not converge, for which alpha is 1.  EDIT: adding: To answer your final question, this is just not the best book to be reading on your own. In my experience, it's rare that a math book can really be read cover-to-cover. Think of Rudin as more of a reference book than a book that teaches you analysis. Others might have suggestions for a book that's actually good for teaching you."

If you had mentioned analysis, topology or algebra then that would have been more concerning (because these form the basic language of almost anything you could study further), but you can easily be a successful mathematician and never touch probability theory in your life.  What are you interested in? I only ask because intro probability theory can be very tedious compared to later material. If you're into graph theory, probabilistic proofs in combinatorics could be interesting. If you like geometry, then Information Geometry will let you look at probability and statistical inference in terms of affine connections on a manifold of probability distributions. If you're interested in real world inference problems and logic, an understanding of Bayesian statistics (like through Jaynes' book) might be helpful.   A first course in probability tends to be fairly heavy on the tricky computations and relatively light on the conceptual insight, so I can understand the frustration. I had the same problem with introductory number theory; going through basic facts about factorization in excruciating detail is not my cup of tea, but it's also not really what studying or using number theory actually looks like.

I am in grad school, social science, and just now taking calculus.   The model I am working with has 3 different dependent variables, with 1 independent variable (time). I believe this is an ordinary differential equation, due to only 1 independent variable.  I am reading a paper where the authors evaluate a few studies utilizing deterministic differential equation models in the social sciences. They reveal how they were applied invalidly, then discussed how this gave misinterpreted results. The authors then outlined specific conditions that require being fulfilled to validly use differential equations in the social sciences. One of them is based off what they state is a principle of differential equations, ""Give reasons why these variables can be assumed to evolve according to a differential equation (at least to a good approximation)- that is, that the rate of change at each moment of time depends only on the values of the variables at that same moment of time."" They state this is based off the principle, ""The rate of change of x at any given moment of time depends only on the value of x itself (i.e., not one some additional values variables), and only on the value of x at that same moment of time (i.e., not on the values in the past).   In consideration to these claims, I am confused. An example is the prey-predator model. The dependent variables' rate of change are both influenced by one another, not only their own value. This is an interdependent relationship. The statement from the authors of this paper, what they claim to be a principle of differential equations, is difficult for me to comprehend with my current perception of how differential equations would work.

So I have a pair cales I need to push and pull on.  The cable that travels the longest is the one I'm basing my calculations/drawings on.  It has to move a total of 56mm; +28mm and -28mm from centre.  These two cable operate in tandem and are timed essentially; in one position cable #A is +28mm and cable #B is -15mm, position two Cable #A is -28mm and cable #B is +15mm.  There are seven positions in total, all with different positions as far as cable/push pull are concerned.  To control these positions I'm using two slotted plates connected either directly to the lever at which the cable is attached to, or intermediately with a second lever - to amplify the travel dictated by the cam plate.  The next lever in the system is connected directly to the shaft on which the cam plates sit.  I turn this lever and the cam plates rotate.  And this is where the system ratcheting arrangement starts.  Operating this lever is the human input lever and it must return to center after it is pushed/pulled; push 56mm causes the cam plates to rotate 45 degrees in one direction, pull 56mm causes the cam plates to rotate 45 degrees in the opposite direction.  These levers are inter-ralated;  changing one levers length/pivot causes the cam plate diameter to grow shrink/grow and then further up the line everything else changes.  Ultimately I need a 2:1 lever - push/pull 56mm with 1.5kg of force is to result in 28mm of cable travel with 3kg of force. That provides In a system that has a ratcheting arrangement as well as a method of providing these seven positions.  The best I can do is a shade over 1:1.

Alternatively just two gears with ratio 2 and with limited rotation to give you the same 56mm and 28mm you need. Just connect the gears to a rack so that it pushes them to the desired distance.  You really need to give us constraints so that we can understand better. (limited space, relative directions, etc.)  Also this isn't really the correct sub, try r/engineeringstudents."

This generalizes the irrationality of sqrt(2) to pretty much all n-th roots of integers.

Get a GOOD linear algebra teacher and take an intro to proof writing course early on. You need to develop strong proof writing skills early on so you don't have to worry about fine tuning them come your junior and senior year. You could even learn how to LaTeX now (assuming you don't already know), but most importantly take initiative and teach yourself new material prior to even learning it in a class room setting.

""Freshman year as a math major"" could mean a lot of different things course-wise, and I haven't seen anything from the OP to specify what their specific course of study will look like (so this advice could be irrelevant until sophomore/junior year or already redundant). However, in any (pure) math undergraduate program one will eventually need to grapple with the notions of proof and abstraction in such courses as real analysis and linear/abstract algebra. I think it would definitely be helpful to have some exposure and experience with these concepts and courses before actually taking them. One often hears of these classes as those which separate those prospective math students who will go on to successfully complete a math major from those who had success in previous, more computational courses, but who won't end up being math majors. This is primarily because those sorts of classes tend to be the first ones which show what further ""real"" math is like, with an emphasis on proofs and jumps in abstraction. These are notions that take a lot of time to sink in and are ones that I would not have wanted to see for the first time when taking real analysis at university. It may very well be that this won't be relevant for your first year OP, as your first year courses might still be fairly computational, but as a general piece of advice I would consider getting ahead of the curve in terms of familiarity with higher math and proof to be one of the most important ways to guarantee success as a math major.  There's lots of good information on this subreddit on elsewhere on the internet regarding specific book recommendations and ways to get acquainted with these notions (I saw someone mention How To Prove It in this thread, which I haven't used personally but is a universal favorite in these sorts of discussions), but more than a TI-89 or a specific set of writing utensils I think that some comfort with higher math is a good way to ensure success as a math major."

math,3dp8fv,plurinshael,2,Sat Jul 18 04:54:16 2015 UTC,Biggest thing you'll need in general for college is time to study.  You'll only physically be in classes about 12 to 15 hours a week instead of nearly 40 hours a week like in highschool.  They typically recommend you have 2 to 3 hours each week to study per credit hour that you are taking.
math,3dp8fv,bomber991,2,Sat Jul 18 06:18:22 2015 UTC,Patience. You'll likely run into a side of mathematics that you've never seen before and it will come as a big shock at first. Be patient and just keep pushing for true understanding and you'll be fine.

A pen/pencil (don't buy a cheap one buy something you care about and wont lose) A white board for the wall(great for group study and it helps to do problems standing up) A giant stack of plane white paper then go to your university and bind them into notebooks(saves money and plane white paper is so much better then lined)   Take advantage of tutorial services, office hours, and join some clubs. Get involved in research early and spend some of your free time learning to code(great skill to have as a math major for both grad school and if you want to get a job out of college)  The above goes for any major though. You might need a cheap scientific calculator if you have to take some physics classes."
math,3dp8fv,sillymath22,3,Sat Jul 18 18:05:07 2015 UTC,"Some people like using tablets to take notes, so maybe look into that. If you don't like tables, find a notebook that you like and find pens/pencils that you like.  Also, learn some LaTeX. It'll be useful if you have to type anything up.   Other than that, learning to program would be helpful. Python is a good intro language that is pretty general. If you like doing stat stuff, R is good for that (though Python is getting increasingly better). If you're considering doing Comp Sci as well (which isn't a bad choice) you'll probably want to learn Java (the most popular programming language and most common for software development) and C/C++ (if you do high level numerical computation, you'll use these languages, though they're also extremely popular/useful in development as well). If you want a ""math-ier"" language, maybe look at a functional language like Haskell (though this would definitely be more of a hobby language). If you're not sure about the CS route, then Python is probably the best choice, because you'll probably be able to pick it up pretty quickly and it is one of the more popular languages around nowadays.  Lastly, reading How to Prove It and How to Solve It would be helpful for a future math major."
math,3dp8fv,elev57,2,Sat Jul 18 03:36:02 2015 UTC,"c is too hard unless you have an interest in computers. You need to understand how a program is organized (data segment, text, .bss, etc), how different parts of code are linked together. This influences your design decisions and helps you fix bugs.  Then you need hours of practice in order to get used to the pitfalls, which have the potential to be disastrous since C is such a low level language.   At this point you've taken a major diversion from math, which is probably a good thing anyway.  C++ has less pitfalls, but it's more complicated and has other time sinks.  I'm not saying don't learn C/C++ - but either learn it well, or don't learn it at all, because if you learn it badly there will be hell to pay."

All of the resources are available to you-- you can ask a question during lecture, you can visit the help room, or you can work on the problem over a couple days if you need to-- all things you can't do if you last-minute everything.  Also, you should be reading the material for the first time before the lectures, then use the lecture to reinforce and clarify the material.

Math,  contrary to what the average person thinks, is not about numbers. It's about the building blocks of the world. It's about universal logic and solid fact. You can't go in to higher level math classes expecting a ""Step 1,Step 2,Step 3, done."" framework. Once you've opened your mind (man, Discrete Mathematics was my favorite beginner class.), the rest kind of comes naturally, because math. is. natural. Learn to manage your time, save paper by practice problems on a little 1'x1' whiteboard, invest in a good calculator early on and you'll be good. also, read the fucking calculator manual. You will save so much time and effort if you actually know how to use it. Modern calculators can do an insane amount of stuff besides the basic 4 functions."

math,3dma1g,oldrinb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:43:17 2015 UTC,"well, the only thing going on here is to notice that the integral on (-∞,∞) is the Fourier transform for zero frequency; so they take the general Fourier transform and then expand f(x) into a series Σ 1/n! f(n) (0) xn  ∫ f(x) dx = lim ω&to;0 √2π ∫ f(x) exp(iωx) dx  ∫ f(x) dx = lim ω&to;0 √2π ∫ ∑ 1/n! f(n) (0) xn exp(iωx) dx  then the idea is to notice that xn can be written as a derivative of the exp(iωx) factor in the Fourier transform, since ∂n/∂ωn exp(iωx) = (ix)n = in xn  so we can rewrite treating our series as a differential operator acting on exp(iωx):  Σ 1/n! f(n) (0) (-i ∂/∂ω)n exp(iωx)  = (Σ 1/n! f(n) (0) (-i ∂/∂ω)n) exp(iωx)  = f(-i ∂/∂ω) exp(iωx)  giving us:  ∫ f(x) dx = lim ω&to;0 √2π ∫ f(-i ∂/∂ω) exp(iωx) dx    so now since f(x) = sin(x)/x = 1/x * (eix - e-ix)/(2i)   and thus f(-i ∂/∂ω) = 1/2 * (e∂/∂ω - e-∂/∂ω) * 1/(∂/∂ω)  so after we factor this out of the integral we're left with the Fourier transform of 1, which is √2π δ(ω):  ∫ f(x) dx = lim ω&to;0 √2π f(-i ∂/∂ω) ∫ exp(iωx) dx  ∫ f(x) dx = lim ω&to;0 √2π f(-i ∂/∂ω) (√2π δ(ω))  ... which is √2π δ(ω); 1/(∂/∂ω) is antidifferentiation giving the Heaviside step function θ(ω) and then the exponentials are shift operators so  √2π f(-i ∂/∂ω) δ(ω) = √2π (1/2 * (e∂/∂ω - e-∂/∂ω) * 1/(∂/∂ω)) (√2π δ(ω)) = 2π (1/2 * (e∂/∂ω - e-∂/∂ω)) θ(ω)  and then  1/2 * 2π * (θ(ω + 1) - θ(ω - 1)) = π (θ(ω + 1) - θ(ω - 1))  so then at ω = 0 we see π (θ(1) - θ(-1)) = π (1 - 0) = π"

Multiply g by itself, call this y. 4. a) If y > x, set L equal to g, and then set g to (g+H)/2. 5. b) If y < x, set H equal to g, and then set g to (g+L)/2. 6. Go to step 3.    Since you only need a solution to the nearest integer, stop when H-L < 1.    Example: What's the square root of 523?  g = 523/2 = 261.5 , L = 0, H = 523 261.5*261.5 > 523 , so g = (0+261.5)/2 = 130.75, H = 261.5  130.75*130.75 > 523, so g = (0+130.75)/2 = 65.38, H = 130.75  65.38*65.38 > 523, so g = (0+65.38)/2 = 32.69, H = 65.38  32.69*32.69 > 523, so g = (0+32.69)/2 = 16.35, H = 32.69  16.35*16.35 < 523, so g = (32.69+16.35)/2 = 24.52, L = 16.35  24.52*24.52 > 523, so g = (16.35+24.52)/2 = 20.44, H = 24.52  20.44*20.44 < 523, so  g = (24.52+20.44)/2 = 22.48, L = 20.44  22.48*22.48 < 523, so g = (24.52+22.48)/2 = 23.5, L = 22.48  23.5*23.5 > 523, so  g = (22.48+23.5)/2 = 22.99, H = 23.5  22.99*22.99 > 523, so g = (22.48+22.99)/2 = 22.735, H = 22.99   Now, since H-L = 22.99-22.48 = 0.51 < 1, you are within 1 of the correct square root, and you can stop.  This is basically a way less efficient version of Newton's method, but since you don't want to do anything other than basic operations, this might be easier to work with (N's method uses derivatives, which you can of course approximate numerically purely with basic operations. So it really depends on your limitations).  The number of steps will be proportional to the ceiling of the log of the number whose root you are trying to find. If you follow the algorithm above, you'll notice that a lot of steps are spent getting to the right general ballpark of the square root. There are probably clever ways of improving on that, but it's late and I can't think of any right now beyond a lookup table for nearby perfect squares (which you said you can't use)."

math,3dmxut,tactics,14,Fri Jul 17 17:41:48 2015 UTC,"A degree of freedom, in a general sense, is associated with the dimension of something.

As for why stats likes to divide by that number, I can't really answer that. My one sentence of vague understanding is that in statistics, you generally deal with spaces which are 1) abstract and 2) have an enormous dimension compared to your average manifold. So dividing might be the easiest way to ""average"" the dimensions, and to give a rough idea of what most of them are doing at once."

math,3dmxut,whacko_jacko,5,Fri Jul 17 20:47:01 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you would appreciate a description which is more intuitive and not just rehashing the definition which you could go read on Wikipedia. It is useful to think about this physically. A manifold can have any number of dimensions, but I will start with the example of a three dimensional manifold for the purpose of illustration.   A smooth, three dimensional manifold is a (topological) space which looks, locally, just like our own. If you imagine yourself floating around (forget gravity) near any given point in your manifold, you will be able to look around with the same freedom as you do sitting there in your chair. As long as you don't look too far off into the distance, and as long as you don't stray too far away from the point where you started, you would just think that you are floating around out in a big flat void like outer space. What exactly I mean by ""too far away"" depends on how curved the space is and the global geometry. For example, your space could contain closed loops! If the space had a very tight closed loop (or if you could see very far), then you could look at the back of your head just by looking in that direction. Likewise, you could detect curvature of your manifold by trying to look in a fixed direction while just travelling around in a circle (nevermind how you are magically propelling yourself around). You would feel the curvature as a tendency to rotate away from your fixed direction. Disclaimer: I am severely blurring the line between differential topology and differential geometry, but for good reason.  The formal definition of a manifold attempts to capture the idea of a space which looks, locally, like a Euclidean space Rn (for some n called the dimension of the manifold) as follows: Around each point in the manifold, you have some blob called an open set which we declare must look like a connected open set in Rn. This is made precise by a rule which assigns coordinates (elements of Rn) to each point in your local blob. You could imagine drawing (not necessarily straight) gridlines into the nearby manifold with a numerical scale which gives a precise (one-to-one) mapping between your local blob in the manifold and some model open set in Rn. For example, your model set could be the open unit ball or the entire space Rn.   So far, this picture is not very interesting, because it is only a local description. We need some way of patching together all of the local coordinate systems into a global object. So, we demand that if your local coordinate system and my local coordinate system overlap to describe some portion of the manifold in two different ways, then the translation between the two systems of coordinates must describe a smooth function in the sense of multivariable calculus. In other words, I have a function from some open set in Rn to some other open set in Rn (or perhaps the same one) which is defined by sending the coordinates of a point in your system to the coordinates of that same point in my system. This function must be smooth (and hence, continuous).   You are already familiar with many examples of manifolds. A point is a manifold of dimension zero, where R0 = {0}. We have straight lines, circles, and various other curves for the typical examples of manifolds of dimension 1. We have surfaces like planes,  spheres,  and tori for manifolds of dimension 2. Perhaps the only manifold of dimension three which you are familiar with is the usual three dimensional Euclidean space. But there are many others! The three dimensional ones all have the property that you could conceivably imagine yourself floating around inside of them, perhaps looking around to understand the global shape. The general classification of three dimensional manifolds is an extremely beautiful and ongoing problem which is tied closely to the classification of knots and links.  There is much more one could describe. Your manifold can have a boundary, which is much easier to imagine if you are sitting inside some larger space looking at the manifold (with boundary) from the outside. For example, a line segment is a one dimensional manifold (with zero dimensional boundary). A disk is a two dimensional manifold (with one dimensional boundary, a circle). A ball is a three dimensional manifold (with two dimensional boundary, a sphere). There is also much to say about manifolds with higher dimension, but it is understandably much harder to use the crutch of visual descriptions."

Moreover, not every embedded manifold in Rn is the preimage of a regular value of a real function. In fact, that happens if and only if its normal bundle is trivial (which, in particular, implies it is orientable). So, for example, there is no smooth function f : R3 -> R with 0 a regular value such that f-1 (0) is the open Mobius strip (I say open just to avoid having a boundary, which would obviously prevent that from happening as well)."

math,3dmxut,Bollu,6,Fri Jul 17 20:22:49 2015 UTC,"What exactly does a topology describe?  I know the definition of a topology (a set S, along with another set U, which is a set of sets of elements of S. U tells you which subsets of S are ""open"". For this to be a valid topology, it has to obey certain rules, like the fact that the Union of open sets is open)  So, while I ""know"" the definition, I have zero intuition for what a topology is.  I know what a metric is, and I can visualize it. So, how does a metric ""impose"" a topology? Are all topoloies generated by a metric?  What is topological structure?"
math,3dmxut,wristrule,9,Fri Jul 17 23:10:15 2015 UTC,"Hi. Topologies take elements of sets and make them stick to each other, so that we can push and pull on the set in a meaningful way. Without a topology a set is rather boring since we can rearrange the elements and do all sorts of crazy things but it doesn't change the set. So what we do is we put a topology on them, which in an intuitive sense, links the elements all together in some consistent way. It's essentially a way to keep track of when two elements are near each other without actually caring about the distance between them, or even without having a well defined notion of distance. If I want two elements in the set to be ""close"" then I put them in a lot of the same open sets, if I want them to be further, I put them in less open sets together.  Now I can pick one element and pull on it or push on it, and it doesn't change it's closeness or nearness to another element, so it doesn't change the ""shape"" of the space at all.   With a metric, you are defining distance. You can get a topology by saying that two elements' closeness should be directly proportional to their distance, but there's no reason to require a notion of distance to define when they're close. Once you have distance, you can start to worry about moving the space in such a way that it preserves distance, angle, etc. I think most people when they imagine topologies have standard euclidean space (Rn ) in mind, which is of course a metric space (and much more)."

For example, consider the topology on the set of natural numbers that defines a set to be open iff it contains 0 (or is empty, of course). Then for any continuous map f to R with 0 in the image and any neighborhood U of 0 in R, f-1(U) contains 0. But for any point x of R other than 0, there is some neighborhood of 0 that excludes x.

Since (-infty, x) U (x, infty) is open, its complement is closed, but its complement is just {x}, so {x} is closed. Since {x} is closed, x is closed.

The basis of a topology is a set of open sets such that all the open sets in a topology is the union of a set of basis elements. In a metric space, this picture is literal; let M be a metric space, and let B(m,x) be the set of all points whose distance from m is less than x. Then the set of all B(m,x) with rational x is a basis for the topology induced by the metric. Any space with a topology induced by some metric is called a metrizable space. Not all spaces are metrizable. Given a set X, the indiscrete topology is the topology on X whose open sets are the empty set and X itself. If X has more than one member, then the indiscrete topology on X is not metrizable."

math,3dmxut,whirligig231,3,Sat Jul 18 00:15:39 2015 UTC,"Well, closeness mainly allows us to define continuity, as others have mentioned. Basically, it gives you a notion of what it means for a surface to be ""one continuous surface"" and not have holes in it, etc. If we keep topology but throw out distance, we get a collection of ways to transform a set while preserving topology, which are called homeomorphisms -- intuitively, these allow us to stretch and bend the surface, but they don't allow us to tear the surface. The question, then, is which sets of points are still distinguishable under these conditions. For instance, a sphere is as good as a cube, or an octahedron, or a topological globe; but there's some way, describable via topology, that a sphere is fundamentally different from a torus (donut). No matter how you ""stretch"" the sphere, you can't make it into a torus.

Let p be a point in X, and let ɛ > 0. Then let V be the set of all points y in Y less than distance ɛ from f(p), i.e. the open ball of radius ɛ around f(p). V is trivially open, so its preimage U is open in X. Then p is an interior point of U, so some open ball around p is contained in U. Let δ be the radius of this open ball: for all x within δ units of p, f(x) is within ɛ units of f(p).

For this reason, people often think of topological spaces as generalised metric spaces, but this intuition is far from satisfactory since it is hard to imagine how someone might come up with the axioms of a topological space from geometric reasoning and, in reality, very few topological spaces are induced by a metric.  In my opinion, the best way to think of topological spaces is as the natural setting for reasoning about semi-decidable properties.

But Euclid never gives justification for why those two circles should intersect at all, or that they should intersect at exactly two points when the radii are chosen properly.

Does this also imply that if no odd perfect number exists, there is a proof of this in ZFC? It would seem to be so, as follows: if there exists an odd perfect number in some model of ZFC, then we can define, in that model, a way (similar to a Gödel encoding) of producing a string that would correspond to a proof of this fact. (Now, within ZFC, we couldn't actually use this proof, but in a meta-logical sense, it exists.) Thus, if there exists an odd perfect number in some model, it is provable that there exists an odd perfect number, and then there must exist such an odd perfect number in every model. We can then say via the contrapositive that if there is some model without an odd perfect number, then no model has one. Then by Gödel's completeness theorem, there is a proof that there is no odd perfect number.

math,3dmvbh,eequalsmc2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:27:26 2015 UTC,"The set of symmetries of something form something called a ""group"". For example, if I have a Rubik's cube with no colors, turning a side makes it look the same. The set of all of these combinations of side turns is a group.  To formalize it, we require three things:   Some element ""1"" which corresponds to doing nothing. Also known as the identity. This would be turning no sides. Combining operations is associative, i.e. (ab)c=a(bc). There is an inverse for every element, so some b such that a*b=1. In other words, for combination of side turns, we can reverse it by applying opposite direction side turns in reverse order.   Some examples you would know:   Integers under addition: a+(-a)=0, a+0=a and (a+b)+c=a+(b+c). Strictly positive rational numbers under multiplication. (Check this yourself) 2x2 Square matrices with determinant 1 under matrix multiplication.   Some non-examples to solidify the idea:   Real numbers under multiplication. 1 exists and it is associative, but there is no inverse element for 0, i.e no a such that 0*a=1. Real numbers under exponentiation: This isn't even associative.   So it turns out, if we think of polynomials with coefficients in some field, like the rational numbers, we can throw in the roots of the polynomial and think in terms of the group that defines symmetries which fix the field of coefficients of the smallest field that also has the extra roots in it. So for example, if we take Q and throw in sqrt(2), we can send sqrt(2) to -sqrt(2) and the field behaves the same, but if we just look at Q it remains fixed.  What ends up happening is we can use this to prove things like ""there is no formula in terms of radicals to express the roots of x5 - x+1"". Because the group for this polynomial, known as the ""Galois group of x5-x+1"" doesn't have a property that all the Galois groups of polynomials that you CAN express the roots in terms of radicals do have."

There is no y such that B(y) = A.   4) Anything that is true of A and for which we can prove it is true of B(x) if we know it is true of x is true of everything.   5) For all x, C(x, A) = x.   6) For all x and y, C(x, B(y)) = B(C(x, y)).   7) D(A) is B(A), and D(B(A)) is A.   8) E(A) is A.   9) For all x, E(B(x)) = D(E(x)).   10) If E(x) is A, then F(x) exists such that C(F(x), F(x)) is x.

We say that two numbers are equal mod N if they have the same remainder after dividing by N. So 3=13 mod 5, 14=20 mod 6 and 31 = 3 mod 4. The great thing about this is that addition and multiplication behave nicely. If A=B mod N then CA=CB mod N and C+A=C+B mod N. This means I can do things like find out what 31x58 is mod 4 by first modding both by 4 to get 31x58=3x2 mod 4 which is 6=2 mod 4. I can do multiplication (and addition) by first reducing it to smaller numbers.   The way your lists are organized, you have all the numbers =2 mod 6 in the first column. all numbers =3 mod 6 in the second, 4 mod 6 in the third, 5 mod 6 in the fourth, 0 mod 6 in the fifth and 1 mod 6 in the last column.  If p is a prime number, then the remainder after dividing by 6 cannot share factors with 6. So the only options are for p to be 1 or 5 mod 6. These two numbers are special because they are the only number mod 6 that I can't multiply by a nonzero number (mod 6) to get zero (mod 6). Notice that 3x2=0 mod 6, but neither 3 or 2 were zero. These are called zero divisors and primes stay away from them. Additionally, if you have a zero divisor, then any multiple of it will also be a zero divisor. That means that I can't multiply something that is 3 mod 6 to get something that is 1 mod 6. So if you have a composite number that is 1 or 5 mod 6, then all of it's factors must also be either 1 or 5 mod 6. The numbers that are not zero divisors is called the Multiplicative Group mod N and almost all the primes must live there and you can't multiply into this set from the set of zero divisors.   There is also the theorem of dirichlet that says that if k is coprime to n, then there will be infinitely many primes =k mod n. This means that there are infinitely many primes that are 1 mod 6 and 5 mod 6. For any integer N, if k is in the Multiplicative Group mod N, then there will be infinitely many primes equal to k mod N.  This is all very great stuff."

Despite running with program until it had a width of about 7000 (well past the edge of my computer screen) the prime density was never larger than ~44% in one column. Of course that number would drop off anyway as the number of primes themselves dropped off.

RE: ""WHAT DO Y'ALL DO WITH YOUR MATH DEGREES?""    I use my math degree as a professional math tutor (I work for myself as a tutor to students of high-school through advanced undergraduate mathematics). I made an earlier post describing my job. You can also get a sense of my job by looking at my website highermathhelp.com.   Keep in mind that to do this, you have to be very entrepreneurial, you must be willing to take risks, and you must be okay with the possibility of a lower income (at least in the beginning) and a lack of benefits.  OTHER OPTIONS I recently wrote about career options for math majors in another post. I was answering a slightly different question, but I intentionally made the answer quite general, so that others could benefit. I think you'll find it helpful.  INTERNSHIPS It's hard to argue the value of a paid internship where you can gain real experience, good references, and connections in an industry that interests you. Try a web search for ""internships for math majors."" Below are some links to get you started. Note that the list by, say State University of New York, includes opportunities outside of New York.   A list from the University of Arizona (grouped by industry/field) A list from the American Mathematical Society A list from the State University of New York A list from the Illinois Institute of Technology You can also try job-related search engines, such as indeed.com or internships.com. Sometimes, it helps to just think of a company you'd like to work for, and then check out their website to see if they have anything available. For example, take a look at Khan Academy's internship page.   Below are a few articles that offer broad perspectives on internships.   Article comparing job results from unpaid internships and paid internships Article about unpaid internships Article about the changing importance of internships   JOB POSTINGS You'll probably find it very helpful to look at current job postings for the kinds of jobs you think would interest you in the future. You may not be ready to apply now, but you can develop a list of the kinds of skills and experience that are in demand, and that will help you focus your studies. (In-demand skills may change, but given that you're only a couple of years from graduation, this should provide you with useful information.)  Apart from the usual job listing sites, there are some that are geared specifically to math-based careers, such as the MAA Math Classifieds.   There is also Mathjobs.org, but I think the jobs there tend to be geared toward those with advanced degrees.   If you'd be interested in working for an edtech (educational technology) company like Khan Academy, Knewton, WebAssign, etc., then the jobs board at edsurge.com has a lot of listings. Again, if there are companies that particularly interest you, just visit the websites for those companies directly.  STATISTICS IN SPORTS I came across an interview with a couple of statisticians for sports teams that you might find interesting, since you mentioned an interest in this area.

A bunch of my friends also became actuaries too. You could look at that too, it is a lot of probability and statistics, but you will need to pass some exams.

Competition is huge in these areas but they are interested in hiring math students. From personal experience (i interviewed at riot and adobe) to set yourself apart you will need to be -really- proficient at coding: A statistical package such as R, SQL (database management) and something like Java/python is a necessity.

A more precise phrasing would be ""Why is X a good model for some real world stuff ?""  In some sense all you can do to answer the question, without becoming too philosophical, is to map all the axioms of the model to real world stuff.  Your question is : ""Why can the theory of differential equations (lets say second order ODEs) be used to construct good models of different physical processes ?"".  A possible ""mapping"" between axioms of this model and real world stuff could go like this: A physicist can only perform measurements in the present, so it makes sense to model for example a particle trajectory as a differentiable function. If some dependency on the past is needed we can model this as parameters of the ODE. Differentiable functions can conveniently be described by differential equations and differentials. Higher order derivatives are used to provide a finer model. Differentials can be regarded as a modelling language for processes based only on the current state.   This model is surprisingly successful for classical mechanics. It is also used in biology and finance in the form of stochastic differential equations, which is basically a theory of first order differential equations for stochastic processes  For chaotic dynamical systems or quantum mechanics it does not work so well.

For example, you can probably come up with a model of E&M such that each point depends on all other points in space, lagged by t=d/c. However, while this may be valid, the formulation interconnects the time dimension with the spatial ones in a nasty way, so we opt for fields that hold a current state at each t so the dimensionality of the problem is one fewer.  Mathematically, any smooth analytic function of t can be written as its Taylor series, and conversely, knowledge of its derivatives at some t is enough to completely reconstruct the function. One would imagine that you only need to consider equations of its derivatives to model any phenomenon dependent on any other aspects of the function.  For the second question: If you have a PDE of say, fourth order (e.g. f''''(x) = f(x)), you can write it as a system of two coupled second-order PDEs (f''(x) = g(x), g''(x) = f(x)), and furthermore as a system of four single-order PDEs.

Maybe as physics evolves and describes more and more details, there might be the need to add something to this in the future, but right now it seems that 'It is as it is.' is all you can say in that regard.    And that's something that bothered me throughout the whole course again and again.

A serious study of diffusion processes lands you into fractional and stochastic calculus. The heat equation is essentially the simplest equation that could be qualitatively correct. In a lot of cases the wave equation is approximate as well, where we assume that the amplitudes are small and assume no coupling between transverse and longitudinal oscillations. More realistic modelling of viscoelastic deformation under tension is far more complicated.  That being said, I do still find it interesting that these work so well for their simplicity."

Why don't more physical models depend on the past state the way an exponentially damping equation would, for example?  Why is it that differential equations that are 'forgetful' of the past so apt to describe physical phenomena?"
math,3dlw9k,dogdiarrhea,7,Fri Jul 17 10:53:25 2015 UTC,"The past does matter, but it only matters to the extent that you set up the same present state that it induced. If you mark the state of some system at a given moment in time, set up a duplicate exactly how the old one was, and run the new system, no analysis will tell you which one was really there and which one was fake.  There are 'memory processes' in physics, like hysteresis, but they're really there because you're not tracking the entirety of the present state. The fraction of it you're measuring isn't enough to determine the future state of the system, but in principle the atoms behaviour can entirely be captured by what's happening to them at the moment. That doesn't really answer the question in full, but I think it narrows the issue down.  Possibly a more constructive comment: if you have a Markov chain or other dynamical system that depends on past states (say, on the last three timesteps) you can always create a new equivalent chain that doesn't, just by broadening what you mean by state (for example, making your new states quadruples of the old ones, so the individual states hold all relevant information). Arguably, physics already does this. If you only measured position you would need to know the history of the system, but if you include velocity in your description (which is like knowing 'the state at the previous timestep') you no longer need to explicitly reference the past in the new description, because your choice of variables does it for you. The idea that you ""don't"" measure the past is really because you've already accounted for all of the relevant ways it affects the present and decided to call that ""the current state"". To better ground the question we'd need some good examples of equations with explicit dependence on the past (delay differential equations) which can't have some extra variables thrown in to remove that dependence. I don't know the field, but it might be a good place to start looking."

Generally speaking, current physics is almost entirely local - that is to say, there is no action-at-a-distance over either space or time.  The only known exception is quantum entanglement. Spatial nonlocality is established by Bell's theorem. As for action-at-a-distance across time, certain interpretations of the delayed choice quantum eraser require temporal nonlocality.

math,3dlw9k,_reccomended_dose,4,Fri Jul 17 12:24:44 2015 UTC,"The point is that you can ""Account"" for history in your ODE or Markov models by adding ""history"" terms to your state.  Say you are modelling a process in discrete time whose immediate future value P{N+1} depends on value of P at times N (i.e. now), N-1 and N-2. Then you can make the a state vector Z_N=[P_N,P(N-1),P(N-2)]. Then the evolution equation is simply: Z_(N+1)=F(Z_N), where F the evolution function.  So just looking at this vector evolution equation, it ""seems"" like the system only depends on current time ""N"", while really it is capturing the history in a clever way.  Exactly the same thing is happening in ODEs, where the order of the differential equation determines how many ""history"" terms we should keep. Since Newton's laws are second order, for a single point mass in 3D we only need  to keep 3*2 (one position, one velocity for each coordinate) =6 equations. The second order is telling as that the evolution depends on current state and current derivative."
math,3dlw9k,craponyourdeskdawg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:49:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, but in case of differentials the ""history"" is still a small epsilon around the present albeit of higher order. A markov chain need not be finite so even knowing a few past states is not much."

Stochastic process {X_t} _ {t in R} are families of random variables indexed by the real numbers, so we can regard them as functions X, mapping the real number t to the generalized real number X_t.  The insight of Ito is then that all Markov stochastic processes can be described by the the Ito integral which he defined. You can formally rewrite this integral in a differential form  dX_t = f(X_t, t) dt + G(X_t,t)dW  which can be read as a definition of ""stochastic differential"" for some unknown Markov process {X_t} for a given f and G.  {X_t} can be generated from the stochastic differential dX_t by choosing and initial value X_0 and using the Ito integral. In complete analogy to first order ODEs. For G=0 you get first order ODE. dW is defined by the Ito integral. A physicist would call dW gaussian white noise, which is an even worse abomination than dirac delta distribution.

A process that has this property is called Markov.   But not all random processes have to be Markov - you can easily write down a model that requires some memory of the past if that makes sense for the thing you are modeling. Sometimes once you've done this you can use tricks like what craponyourdeskdawg describes to then take your non-Markov process and make it Markov by considering the 'current' state to be a vector of the past n states or whatever (but then things get complicated complicated).   Really I wasn't meaning to be very technical beyond saying that this kind of memorylessness is pretty standard and not just a DE thing.

Differential equations deal with change, so it is pretty natural that differential equations should appear.  Second you are probably reading introductory texts meant for undergraduates. There is a biasing in these texts in that they tend to emphasis low order linear differential equations that can be solved analytically relatively quickly. For educational purposes this makes sense. You have to learn to solve low order linear equations before you can solve nonlinear or high order equations. (You have to learn to walk before you can run).  Linear equations don't depend on past states. But many nonlinear equations do. They exhibit a hysteresis. An example of something that exhibits a hysteresis is a ferromagnet. If you've taken an intermediate E&M course you probably touched on this briefly.  Similarly higher order differential equations appear all the time in physics. We can solve many of these equations using the same techniques that we use to solve 2nd order equations. Solving the higher order equations often requires more effort.

math,3dlw9k,craponyourdeskdawg,3,Sat Jul 18 09:22:35 2015 UTC,"Math is the language of pattern, predictability, consistency and structure. Finding the physical laws of our world is about finding the set of patterns that allow us to predict things in a structured and consistent manner. Math and physics are a perfect fit.  Physical laws only depend on the now because they are local in spacetime. They are local in space because things happening at x only depend explicitly on what's going on at x, not on what's going on at y three light years away. Non-locality in space can be...awkward for relativity, depending on how exactly it appears. By the same token, they are local in time as well: stuff happening now only depends explicitly on what's happening now. If it depended on the past, you would also open the door for it depending on the future (remember, time reversal symmetry means past and future are the same thing), and when the future affects the present you say goodbye to causality and hello to time travel.  Differential equations have to be of even order in time and space to preserve time reversal and parity inversion symmetries. I don't know why they are specifically second order and not fourth or 68th."

So there is a dependency with the past in this sense : you need to know the state of the system at some time before to fully solve the equation and to be able to predict the evolution of the system.  When you say ""mostly second orders"" could you cite the equations you think of ?  Newton's law has second order but that's all I can think of...  Last thing : saying that our world ""just works out to be a bunch of differential equations"" is a strong philosophical statement. You could say that it's the easiest way we found to model it. So it's mostly PDE because our models are simpler and more understandable under this form."

math,3dlw9k,Exomnium,4,Fri Jul 17 10:50:29 2015 UTC,I'd say the main quality you want about a model is efficiency : you have to explain phenomenon you already know and predict some others you don't. So searching a equivalent (in the sense of the same explaining and predicting capacity) model to a really well functioning one is losing your time (assuming this equivalent model even exists).

One can construct programs using lambda calculus, pi calculus (process algebra) and things like that. Even though they are equivalent at the end of the day, the machinery they use is different, which I believe makes them fundamentally different  Or the study of functions.

(i.e. secure that before you go)  The general rule in academia is that you'll be seeking a professorship a tier down from where you get your PhD. So, if you go to a second tier school, get ready to teach at a third tier school, and if you go to a third tier school, get ready to teach at a community college or a worse third tier. Either way you'll probably adjunct for a while first. For the most part it is an abusive process, which is why kind of a lot of people are cheesed at the academic job market lately.  If you want to work in industry, go for it. A master's is probably worth it, at least, and you will know by that point whether there is anybody there who will make staying there the extra few years worthwhile. Yes, many of the best industry jobs still do go to top tier grads, but unlike academia, there are decent jobs left for others.  One thing to keep in mind if you go for the industry PhD is that the skills and workflow of industrial and academic jobs tend to be quite different, so this is a decision you want to make in your first year, second at the latest. In other words, industry isn't just a ""backup plan"" like so many people like to say. You have to prepare for that, too, and in different ways than academia. (For one thing, you'll be focusing on networking with industry leaders more than you will on your pub count.)  Also, something to keep in mind when looking into programs is that interdisciplinary programs are getting bigger. You don't have to do a straight up PhD in pure math. You can do a computational math thing, a biomath thing, a financial math thing- all these areas have programs with growing funding, which means everything about the process is going to be better, from teaching load to research quality to job outlook both in and out of industry."

If you're asking yourself whether or not it's worth it, it's probably not for you. If the prestige is really what you're after, it's probably not worth it.  2) Yes, you can definitely get academic jobs. You can't be particularly choosy (you may have to work in a part of the country you didn't know existed at a school you didn't know existed or you may get lucky), you won't get a research-heavy position, but if you're willing to teach as well as do research it can be done.   3) institution carries a lot of weight especially across fields but in a particular field mathematicians know each other and they know who is good.

Grad school in math is less rigidly structured, but typically it's around three years of courses, leading to an M.A., followed by an indeterminate number of years writing a dissertation.  Typically that can take about three years, but I know people who've spent more like seven or eight years.  (And math is actually quite nice in this regard; in many other fields spending six years on the dissertation alone is the norm, and 12-15 years isn't atypical.)  At this point the top few people in the country could theoretically become professors immediately, but almost everyone then does 3-6 years of postdocs.  So a great student at a top school probably takes about ten years to get onto tenure track, and then another six to get tenure.

They spend their lives and fortunes memorizing minutia (and for lawyers, arbitrary minutia completely invented out of wholecloth) for no other reason than to get a job. They do not learn much.

For a sufficiently narrow view of what being a REAL <insert discipline here> is, you can paint a gloomy portrait for anyone, even accountants.   A PhD in mathematics will help in every discipline I mentioned except for actuaries which you correctly point out, completely missing the point of course. An actual academic degree (not a trade skill certification like an MD or JD) isn't supposed to be a passcard that lets you get better jobs.

In grad school I was trained to do one thing, to be a mathematician.  It was certainly the place where I learned math techniques    according to best industry practice.   I don't know of any math grad school that isn't training its students to be mathematicians, what else would they be doing?  EDit:FORMATTING"

As a lawyer or MD you learn a lot, you learn a strict subset of what anyone working in the field knows, enough for them give you a paper that says you're allowed to have a job. But it's knowledge-transfer learning rather than knowledge-building learning. As a PhD student you learn more than anyone ever has in human history about a particular topic, and in that context I think it's fair to compare the two and say one comes up short, though it's no fault of the discipline, that's exactly how doctors should be trained.   And a trade school is a school you pay for that prepares you for a job. If you're paying to do a PhD you're doing it wrong. You certainly learn some of the necessary tools to become a math professor in grad school (though not all! self-marketing, networking, looking down on people whose institutions are less prestigious than yours, academic politics are all missing.) but that's not really the goal or the point, maybe some schools are professor factories now instead of focused on the actual goal, the new research/contribution/dissertation/work, and maybe that's why the supply for faculty far outweighs the demand."

If you start with g(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x2 + ... + a_(n-1) xn-1 and solve for the a_i to meet the criteria above, you get exactly the coefficients for the taylor series expansion."
math,3dmfcn,CrazyStatistician,8,Fri Jul 17 13:48:52 2015 UTC,"In other words, we are looking for a function g that coincides with f at x = 0, but there is an infinity of these and almost all of them are bad approximations to f(x) away from x = 0. For example, if f(x) = sin(x), then g(x) = 2x and g(x) = cos(x) - 1 both coincide with f at x = 0, but both are poor approximations to f for values of x away from 0. So additionally we require the gradients to match at x = 0. This gives a better approximation: g(x) = x is a possibility, but g(x) = 2x no longer is. To get a better approximation still, we require the second derivatives to match, and so on."
math,3dmfcn,paolog,10,Fri Jul 17 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"The first term, f(a), approximates the function at the point a.  This would be the exact formula for f(x) if f were a constant function, but of course not all functions are constant.   f(x) ≈ f(a) (exactly equal when f is constant)   Consider the second term of the Taylor series, f'(a)(x - a).  We are multiplying the slope (change in y/change in x) of the tangent at a by the distance of a point x from a (change in x), which gives us the change in y of the tangent line between a and x.  So, if the function f were linear and therefore coincided with its tangent line, adding this second term to the first f(a) term would give you the exact value of f(x); if not, it's at least a better approximation than f(a):   f(x) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)  (exactly equal when f is linear)   But of course not all functions are linear.  The derivative is changing between a and x, which means the function f(x) ends up at a different point from the sum of the first two terms.  So let's approximate the derivative itself by its own two-term expansion: f'(t) ≈ f'(t) + f''(a)(t - a).  If we integrate this from a to x to get the approximated derivative's contribution to f(x), we have f'(a)(x - a) + f''(a)(x - a)2/2.  Add that to f(a) and you have the three-term Taylor expansion, which is exact for quadratic functions:   f(x) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + f''(a)(x - a)2/2 (exactly equal when f is quadratic)   But of course not all functions are quadratic, so let's account for the change in the double derivative.  Use the three-term expansion for the derivative: f'(t) ≈ f'(a) + f''(a)(t - a) + f'''(a)(t - a)2/2.  Integrate this from a to x again, and you have f'(a)(x - a) + f''(a)(x - a)2/2 + f'''(a)(x - a)3/6 as an even better approximation of the changing derivative's contribution to the value of f(x):   f(x) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + f''(a)(x - a)2/2 + f'''(a)(x - a)3/6 (exactly equal when f is cubic)   But of course not all functions are cubic...  Edit: bold formulas, add Taylor partial sums between paragraphs.  Edit2: add one more step, since there are two ways to go from the three- to the four-term expansion, and this way is simpler; also explicitly write out the one-term expansion."

math,3dmfcn,fugitivesam,4,Fri Jul 17 15:23:05 2015 UTC,"Nope. The standard example is f(x)=e-1/x2, where we specially define f(0)=0. You can prove that this is differentiable to all orders everywhere, but at x=0 its Taylor series is just 0. (i.e. the zero function; all derivatives at x=0 are 0). The negative exponential decreases faster than any form of polynomial growth increases, so all derivatives are forced to zero. Unfortunately, the function itself is not zero anywhere else. The infinite Taylor series does not match the function in any region around zero. It changes from zero more slowly than any derivative can detect, but it still does change.  In other words, there are infinitely differentiable functions (smooth functions) which have zero radius of convergence for their Taylor series (are not analytic). I assume you can make this happen at every point on a function (where in my example it only happens at x=0), but I don't know of an explicit construction."

Which means we have a perfect representation of the function. However, we just want an approximation. So what we do, is we restrict n. We don't take all terms, just some of them.  So, let's pick some k in I. Now, pick all terms in the expansion of f(x) such that n <= k  This gives you  f(x) = a0 + a1 (x - x0) + a2 (x - x0)2 + .. + ak (x - x0)k  where a_k = fk (x) / k!  Where k is some Integer. We just got ourselves a polynomial, since we have an honest to god highest term of degree k.  However, note that we left terms out (all terms of degree k+1 and above). This is called the error in the Taylor series, and Taylor's theorem tells you how to compute the error"
math,3dmfcn,Bollu,2,Fri Jul 17 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"The other comments are pretty good, so I just want to add one point about the motivation.  Back when you learned derivatives, at some point someone should have shown you that when you zoom in far enough on a graph it ""looks like a line"", and the slope of that line is the derivative.  At some point you should have been asked to write down that line---something like y=f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0).  That's the tangent line, and it's also called the ""linear approximation"" (your classes may or may not have discussed that): it's the line that's as similar as possible to f at x_0.  The Taylor series is the generalization of that idea: if we want to approximate f at x_0 by a quadratic function, we should pick the particular quadratic function which 1) goes through the point (x_0,f(x_0)), 2) has the same slope as f at x_0, and 3) has the same second derivative as f at x_0."

ACOPS introduces many useful ideas and ways of thinking if you are new to problem solving/contests.  Putnam and Beyond covers college math topics like algebra, analysis, linear algebra, etc. So, you should learn those first if you haven't yet. Otherwise, it's a good book though since it has a lot of solutions (half of the book is solutions) and many of the problems are hard.  Also, you can access all past Putnam problems here. Doing past problems is very helpful. Good luck!"

As for Real Analysis, I think it's good to know the rigorous foundation of calculus (formalization of derivative, integral, sequence theorems, etc.), but I'm not sure how useful things like metric topology will be, at least in earlier problems.  I've never read Larson, so I'm not sure about it, but ACOPS is definitely a worthwhile read. I don't think you have to focus entirely on one book. A lot of people only read tidbits or parts they find interesting in a book, and still learn a lot and/or do very well. Feel free to skip around and read chapters you find particularly interesting in the book."

Your last reply is quite surprising to me since I thought that many mathematical people read a book from page one to the last page.  So is it best for me to read the parts from book that are interesting to me and learn in a non-linear order (study whatever that interests me) rather than being obliged to only one book?    As for the real analysis, I do not know if you read my very recent post, but is it okay to read Rudin/Pugh/Apostol/Royden/Folland/Rosenlicht rather then the ""transition"" books of Spivak/Apostol(Calculus)/Courant?"
math,3dnu9a,fluffyx30037,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:01:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you read around the AOPS forums, many people suggest doing and learning things that you personally find interesting or enjoyable. If you force yourself to finish a book, or to do some amount of reading in some amount of time, you'll probably get tired of studying faster.  I didn't do all the problems in ACOPS, nor did I read all the chapters (the geometry chapter is probably not that helpful for the Putnam since geometry rarely shows up), but I'd say I still learned/improved a lot.  I think it's okay to go directly into Rudin without Spivak (or similar) if you know the basic methods of proof (induction, proof by contradiction, set theory, etc.). I actually read Rudin without reading Spivak (though I heard Spivak is a very good book), so you can probably do it as well. Just be warned, some of the material is dense and some of the problems are quite challenging (even if they're not contest problems). It takes a while to learn some of the theorems and proofs.  As for Putnam Fellow, I'm not anywhere near that level haha so I can't really help you there. I know some fairly advanced topics (like tensors or Fourier analysis) show up in the later problems recently, but I have no clue how one would prepare for those."

Also, if you hang out in #math on freenode, people there seem to love to show you cool things, and you will get sidetracked.  I find that when I try to teach myself, there's a lot of tangential learning that happens as I try to explain things to myself. When you're in a class, the instructor knows how to teach the subject, so there's not a lot of ""looking around"" that happens. This is great to learn a topic in a quick way, but you learn less overall is my observation. The things that have stuck with me are those I taught myself, but it took a long time. I'd gladly take a class over having to teach myself Real Analysis.  But, well, I don't particularly see that as a bad thing.

Then, after you take your courses and more importantly pass your quals you can finally have a professor ""take you under their wing"" so to speak. Therefore, reaching out to a prof. may not necessarily be a bad idea during a senior undergrad year, and it's certainly crossed my mind. However, I don't think it would really make an impact just in my opinion. Overall though taking into account the area of expertise of the faculty is important for most colleges but for UM since I used it before it has such a large math department it makes it very flexible, they also have a wide array of courses they offer, which is really what initially intrigued me with that specific program.   Anyways, you raise a separate question, do you really think reaching out to a professor will bare any fruit in strengthening my overall application? I definitely see the appeal and can't deny its existence, but just going about making first contact seems intimidating for lack of better words.

So let's try and convert risk points into something more substantial:  Say you are riding your bike without a helmet. Let's assume there is a 10% chance of falling off your bike, and a 30% chance of getting a concussion if you fall off. Let's also add a 5% risk of crashing into something, and a 70% chance of getting a concussion if you crash. We have to calculate a few different probabilities:   Chance of falling: 10% Chance of getting a concussion by falling: 10% * 30% = 3% Chance of crashing: 5% Chance of getting a concussion from a crash: 5% * 70% = 3.5%   So there is a 15% chance of getting hurt. Of those 15%, 6.5% would result in concussions, or ~43% of falls. You can't add those two together because getting a concussion requires an accident in the first place.

G(s)   where (.) is multiplication, and H, F, and G are the corresponding frequency domain versions of the functions.  That is, the convolution of one function with another is simply considering them both in the frequency domain, multiplying them element-wise, and then converting the constructed frequency spectrum into time domain    So, if you can imagine what the two functions look like in the frequency domain, then I'd say you have a solid grip on convolution.  Take the Dirac Delta function for example. It has all frequencies in it, so when you convolve against another function, you'll simply get the original function itself (since the frequencies of the original function are just multiplied by 1)  That was what helped give me the clearest picture of convolution, personally."

math,3dib7s,r4and0muser9482,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:23:25 2015 UTC,"if you convolve f1 * f2 = g  in a sense what you have done is added scaled and shifted versions of f1 to itself.   the values of f2 tell you how much to scale certain shifts of f1.  So if you convolve   f1 * (dirac(t) + dirac(t-1))     you get   f1(t) + f1(t-1)   Cause you added a version of f1 to a version of itself that was pushed over by 1. Note that f2 in this case is composed of diracs cause determining the scale and shift is done by integrating - so a dirac is the only way to get a ""clean"" sample. Otherwise there is some smearing.   Or consider   g = f1 * h  where h = 1 for 0<=x<1 and for all other values h = 0 - its a square of unit height and width.     1___ ___|   |____     0   1   In this case what you're doing is taking a bunch of copies of f1 (all of the same height) shifting them distances between 0 and 1 and added them together. You've smeared f1 right where x values of h tell you how far you've smeared f1 (from 0 over 1 unit) and the height of h tells you then ""intensity"" of smearing at different points.    If you let h be the unit step function     1_____________________ . . . ___|        0   1   Then convolving f1 and h can be seen as integrating f1. The repeated adding and shifting of f1 to itself is analogous to the sampling and accumulating in integration.  So what does this mean physically?  It can be proved that any operator which is linear and time invariant can be represented as a convolution.  I.e.  An operator is any sort of process you have to change a function. Given any operator O where for all scalar a it is true that  O(a * f(x)) = a * O(f(x))   and if  O(f(x)) = g(x)   then   O(f(x-a)) = g(x-a))   Then there exists an f2 such that  f(x) * f2(x) = g(x)   where the ""*"" is convolution. Okay, that doesn't sounds physical at all. But wait, it is, and it's incredibly general and powerful.  What it means physically is that any process which doesn't change with time and which has a scaling input / output factor - either the controls for some vehicle, or the way sounds reverberate in a room, or countless other things, can all be represented as ""smearing"" in this way.  I.e. the reverberation of your voice in a room can be considered as some version of the original sounds you spoke convoluted through time by a function which represents the ""sound shifting effects"" of that room.  Or the relationship of the accelerator pedal to the cars speed can be understood in some sense as a smearing of how far you've pushed down the pedal through time. Pressing the pedal doesn't instantly make the care go faster - the car speed is a function of how quickly you've been pressing the pedal recently.   In this case too you could convolute ""how much you press the pedal"" with a ""function showing the cars responsiveness"" to get the cars speed.  Now there's some ways this model can break down - as I said it only works with cases that are linear and time invariant.   Let's say your room echoes different at different times of day - suddenly a simple convolution doesn't as you model anymore (you could use different convolution functions at different times of day, but it's not all part of the same model anymore...).   Alternately the car example is not exactly clean. For example for it to be a proper LTI system the car cannot move when you don't press on the pedal.  if   O(a*f(x)) = a * O(f(x))   then      O(0*f(x)) = 0   There are other reasons why this doesn't work exactly (lol wind resistance is not linear) but it gives you an idea of what convolution  can mean.  Convolution of functions also represents multiplication in the frequency domain. I'm not going to try and explain that though, because I don't think people (cough myself) tend to have a lot of frequency domain intuition - let's just say though that multiplication is a lot easier than convolution so typically systems like this are all dealt with after converting every to its frequency components."

Say there are two functions, f and g, and we want to know their convolution h = f * g, for all times t (or any other independent variable) that they depend on.  The idea is that let f (or g, either is fine) be the so-called ""impulse response"" of the system we are studying. Impulse response simply means how the system would behave when we hit it with a single Dirac delta function. Very vaguely speaking, what would the system do when we give it a little, mathematical poke?  The convolution f * g, then means, what would the system do, if instead of the delta function, we had given it the input g(t).  The reason it is equivalent to start this discussion with either f(t), or g(t), as the impulse response is because convolution is commutative: f * g = g * f.  Physically, I see it as the result of passing one function over the other, in a sequential, time-ordered manner, to see their combined effect."

math,3dlaka,Ukrainian_Reaper,5,Fri Jul 17 04:47:13 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the biggest problem with how HS math is taught is the teachers (sorry teachers).  For the record, I have studied secondary education and math and decided to continue for my Ph.D. so that I could teach college, so I am trying to not be just some ivory tower mathematician.  When I say the problem is teachers, I mean that the quality of teachers that I had in hs, as well as the quality of new math teachers I have met are not great.  There are a couple of really good ones, but most of these people were those who did well enough in math in high school, but struggled in math classes once you got past the ""calculation classes"", i.e. once you got into proofs.  Anecdotally, I remember my geometry teacher telling my class that he hated proofs and that they weren't important.  This is what needs to change.  Over the years, these teachers get more set in their ways and tend to forget some of the more advanced topics, which is a shame.  I always say, even a middle school math teacher should know abstract algebra; when a student asks ""why does this algebraic rule work?"" the teacher should know the answer even if it will be above the students' head.  That teacher might be able to provide the student with a partial answer or lead them to other interesting ideas rather than just saying ""it just does"".  (A phrase I had heard some of my education classmates use while in school myself - and it made me cringe every time.)  But I don't really blame the teachers as much as I blame the system around it, and I have thought of the following change (which seems good to me but I understands that it would be very difficult to implement - not just due to money but also because there would be a lot of backlash from the administration):  Personally, I think the head of a math department in a district should have a Ph.D.  Every month or so, the department would meet and briefly and informally go over what will be taught in the next sections of the various courses.  Someone with a Ph.D. in math or math ed. would be able to remind the other teachers about some of the bigger ideas that govern the lessons being taught as well as talking about common mistakes that students have.  This would not only help new teachers know where pitfalls might occur but also help older teachers from falling into ruts.  This is sort of an idea that I have been thinking of for about a year, and so I'd love to hear other people's ideas about it.  Again, I don't mean to ""bash"" high school math teachers too much, but even they could use some help sometimes.  TL;DR: I think a lot of the problem comes from the fact that there are no ""real mathematicians"" in most school districts.  Most high school teachers are very good at teaching rote methods, but are not as good at teaching concepts, which is ultimately more important.  Edit: I know this simplifies a lot of the problems in high school education (state requirements, socioeconomic problems, etc.) but this is just an idea I have been throwing around with other teachers, and NOT a catch-all solution.  Also, I work in the US, so I don't really know what problems might exist in other countries.  Edit 2: Spelling/grammar corrections.  UGH sorry this turned into a wall of text."

However I will never forget when he said ""I hate doing these proofs"".  That was the moment I realized that teachers aren't necessarily as interested in their subject as much as they should be.

Side blocks have 8 positions and 2 rotations for each position.  Corner blocks have 8 positions and 3 rotations for each position.  This means that you could write each ""move"" as a linear transformations that affects only the 8 blocks involved.  Which leads to the fact that it is ""possible.""  But consider the number of positions that each block can occupy, and how much you have to manipulate your matrix for each move, and it quickly becomes a daunting task.

It goes into more than just your standard 3x3 Rubik's cube, but 267 pages of mathematics is not a single afternoon's reading.  Good luck!"

math,3diu8p,spriteguard,3,Thu Jul 16 21:44:09 2015 UTC,"I know that group theory is very important in studying Rubik's cube, there is one strategy called Human Thistlethwaite that uses subgroups, and one called Heise that uses commutators and conjugates. I am not really clear on the relationship between group theory and linear algebra, but it seems like they are very closely linked, so it's likely you could re-frame one of those strategies in terms of linear algebra. If you don't care about actually doing it yourself, you can also look at the true Thistlethwaite algorithm."

math,3diu8p,gammaStar,3,Thu Jul 16 17:39:20 2015 UTC,"Your instincts are correct, there is definitely a connection between the Rubik's Cube and Matrices, in general its called Representation Theory (of Finite Groups.)  First, the Rubik's cube is an example of a finite group.  BTW, the identity is the move where you don't do anything to the cube!  There are two popular ways to get your hands on and study a group.  One is by something called a <permutation representation>, the other is by something called a <matrix representation>.  Many times people drop the word ""matrix"" when they talk about the latter.    First, Permutations. The first theorem that is useful to know is that every finite group can be represented by a collection of permutations (Cayley's Theorem).  There are several notations for permutations, by far the most useful is the cycle notation.  You can see a nice example worked out for the Rubik's cube worked out in  GAP here.    For instance, the move of rotating the front face 90 degrees clockwise, let's call it F, is given by the permutation F=(17,19,24,22)(18,21,23,20)( 6,25,43,16)( 7,28,42,13)( 8,30,41,11).  Similarly, let's call the other moves B(=turn back face 90 degrees clockwise), T(=top..), D(=down..), R(=right...), L(=left...).  The  important thing to notice is that any position of the cube is a sequence of the moves given by L,R,T,D,F,B.  In other words any position of the cube is a <word> in the <alphabet> given by L,R,T,D,F,B.  Group theorists would say, ""the Rubik's group is generated by L,R,T,D,F,B."".   This is may seem obvious, but suppose \sigma is some position of the cube, then \sigma must be a word in L,R,T,D,F,B.  Suppose for instance if we were able to determine   \sigma = R2 F B2 D,   then to solve the position given by \sigma we'd just undo this sequence of moves (in group theory parlance, we'd ""invert \sigma"").  There is a nice analogy to factoring integers to make here, just as you might factor an integer into primes, say 48=24 3, to ""solve"" a position of the cube given by \sigma, you want to ""factor"" \sigma in terms of L,R,T,D,F,B.  Incidentally GAP has algorithms implemented that do this when given the permutation representation.  Now the Matrix Connection.  You can also represent a group as a collection of matrices called a matrix representation.  Then solving a position \sigma becomes the problem of ""factoring"" the matrix representing \sigma in terms of the matrices representing L,R,T,D,F,B.    Here's where the Linear Algebra comes in.  Remember all those row operations? They can be accomplished by multiplying by matrices called, wait for it....Permutation Matrices.  This means Gaussian Elimination is accomplished by multiplying by a string of permutation matrices.     Then to solve the position given by \sigma we just need to apply Gaussian Elimination to the matrix representing \sigma????   That'd be great, but unfortunately not true, you have to modify your Gaussian Elimination by using only the matrices that represent L,R,T,D,F,B as your ""row"" operations.  Without having looked at, I'm guessing that the video /u/dp01n0m1903 refers to explains this process, calling it Non-Gaussian Elimination.  Hope this helps."

One is to be ""mathematically raised"" in the right culture--go to a school or live in a place where people care about math competitions--and then decide for yourself that you want to be one of the people who wins these things. Then you study.  But a lot (maybe even most) of the good contestants go to schools like yours, where few people actually care about the contest. They take the test, enjoy it, and do fairly well on it, qualify for the next round, and find out that it's a series of tests culminating in the IMO. They get excited about it and study for it in the future. (Unfortunately, this doesn't really work if you take it for the first time in 12th grade.)"

Local opportunities (good high school math teams, good local math circles, high concentrations of mathletes) is a big factor. The online community ArtOfProblemSolving has done a lot to democratize the process, it's much easier for students in non-competitive areas to join the community. The most important factor is still practice and determination.  The selection process is pretty complicated:   The American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) is a 15-question 3-hour test given since 1983 to those who rank in the top 5% (or score at least 100) on the AMC 12 high school mathematics contest (formerly known as the AHSME), and starting in 2010, those who rank in the top 2.5% (or score at least 120) on the AMC 10.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Invitational_Mathematics_Examination   AMC 12 based indices are determined by taking AMC 12 Score + 10(AIME Score). AMC 10 based indices are determined by taking AMC 10 Score + 10(AIME Score). Cutoffs, based on AMC 12 indices, are determined so that approximately 260-270 students qualify for the USAMO. Cutoffs, based on AMC 10 indices, are determined so that approximately 230-240 students qualify for the USAJMO. If a student took the AMC 10 and 12 (i.e. AMC 10A and 12B or AMC 12A and 10B) and qualified for both the USAMO and USAJMO, the student must take the USAMO.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad#Present   The main purpose of MOP, held since 1974, is to select and train the six members of the U.S. team for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Students qualify for the program by taking the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO). The top twelve American scorers from all grades form the ""black"" group. The approximately eighteen next highest American scorers among students from 11th grade and under form the ""blue"" group. In 2004, the program was expanded to include approximately thirty of the highest-scoring American freshmen and sophomores each year, the ""red"" group; this was later split into two, forming the ""green"" group, which consists of approximately fifteen of the highest-scoring freshmen and sophomores who have qualified through the USAMO, and the ""red"" group, which consists of those who have qualified through the USAJMO. The colorful designations of these groups were adapted from Karate. In 2013, the red and green groups were unified. Also, with the new system the Black Group includes more or less only the IMO team, which is not necessarily all USAMO winners.  Until 2011, only Black MOPpers were eligible for the selection to the USA IMO team, determined by combining USAMO results with results of a similar exam called the Team Selection Test (TST). From 2011, a new test called the Team Selection Test Selection Test (TSTST) was established; this test is open for any of the participants of MOP, and along with results from the USAMO, determines the students who take the TSTs. This ultimately, along with the USAMO and MOP tests, determines the IMO team.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Olympiad_Summer_Program"

The reason Russia scores so high is because they are (were) good at filtering the good guys into a separate, more demanding, system. Such systems do not exist in many other parts of Europe.   example:  There used to be entrance exams for various studies, but except for medicine they all got removed in the name of democratization. This makes the first year of engineering a disaster, since 2/3 are not at all fit for the studies and the principle of the magnetic middle still applies.   To pay for this 'democratization', we got a rule that people can only take up 72 study points each year(60 is the standard), so doing two majors at the same time now requires jumping through hoops and is heavily discouraged."

After that, it's your choice wether or not you continue and after the first three weeks they instantly give you a mathematical exam so everyone is at a certain level. Does not seem like they hold back to give everyone a chance, they keep it hard but give people who are very passionate a chance to improve their mathematical abilities if they really want to go into engineering and put in the time.  I'm personally going into my first year of engineering, which is something I care deeply about, and I'm happy I have the chance to improve and measure my mathematical abilities because sadly my high school sucked ass in the maths department. I started doing lots of exercises leading up to the first time, which allowed me to actually answer most questions on the test. I still failed, but I kind of expected that, and now I'll follow the course and do more exercises at home to prepare myself.  It's hard work, and it'll be even harder during the year itself, but I believe it's great that people who really want to study engineering have a chance to get their math up to par."

I've just finished my first year of engineering, so if you're at the KULeuven the following tips might be useful:  -The exams in the first semester are way easier than the lessons, because there are only exercises and if you make the exams of the previous years you will find an easy pattern to follow. The only exception to this is chemistry, chemistry is very tough so keep track during the year at all costs on both the exercises and theory. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't study the things you learned in the lessons since you will need those for later. Just in case you're panicking and can't do everything: drop the theory first (except for chemistry)  -Pretty much everything you can think of (summaries, previous exams, solutions to a ton of exercises, ...) is on dropbox. Check it out since when studying for the exams it's at least as useful as the lessons you got during the year.  -More than half of the people that start the first year will drop out. Humans have a tendency to go towards the mean of the behavior of the population they're in, but in this case that means that you fail. Don't look at other people, keep track of the material and don't listen to others when they say they haven't done anything yet. They will fail.   -If you don't know what to do this summer, review your highschool chemistry. Trust me, you won't regret it.  If you have any more questions feel free to ask :)"

The tips are greatly appreciated. I'm going to study in Ghent tho, but I imagine they're very similar.  I'll review my maths and chemistry then. I did well in chem but I also didn't feel like the bar was very high."
math,3ddqgr,pappypapaya,3,Wed Jul 15 22:43:39 2015 UTC,"Well if you study in Ghent the part about chemistry might be less important, since the individual courses vary a lot.  But other than that I think it's very similar indeed.  On last tip I forgot: Engineering is not that difficult. The reason that people struggle with it is that it. just. keeps. coming. You might miss reviewing one lesson, then you can't follow the next lesson and it spirals out of control from there. Then people start to party to forget their troubles and obviously that doesn't help with getting back in control. So try to keep on track and if you start to get behind on something, drop a chapter that detached from the other material if you have to so that you can get back on track for the lessons.  Good luck, engineering is loads of fun if you put in the time and feel that you are in control :)"

They I believe all fly to Copenhagen, Denmark and train there only for a few weeks.  But again, population cannot be discounted - I know from experience that some people are just naturally much better. There was one kid in our team in particular who stands out, he won the Icelandic nationals the first year he competed (having way less practice than the people competing the fourth time in a row), won the Nordic mathematical contest twice and ended up being 1 point away from a silver medal. After training with him, and knowing him a bit from the contests I can attest that he's simply much, much, smarter than I am to the point of it being no contest between us (and I was second in the Icelandic nationals and did fine in the Nordic contest) and I can only assume that the same applies to the best in the big countries, only more pronounced."

math,3ddqgr,Ryoji_M,6,Wed Jul 15 22:09:03 2015 UTC,"Here's my take on it for Norway's situation (just my personal opinion): Higher education is very accessible, especially since we have access to student loans from the government with very reasonable interest. But primary education and high school is an absolute disaster when it comes to encouraging students to excel at anything; especially mathematics. The Jante law is strong here, and the equality principle is often taking to absurd levels in our culture. You're not supposed to be better than anybody else. As such, promising students are not encouraged or given interesting tasks to work with, and they often struggle at school because of being bored. Most if not all human resources in the education system are spent on stopping bullying and helping students with extra needs / disabilities. Which is great, but there is a balance to be struck.  In addition to all this, the education system abhors any form of competition (again, we don't like to compare achievements and declare winners and losers), and we don't pay our teachers very well. All this greatly improves in university/college, but IMO is for high school students.  For winners in these math competitions, I see a clear pattern. They come from countries where math competitions is seen as a good sport whether you win or lose, and where talented kids are not completely left to their own devices, but nurtured. The countries with the highest scoring participants also put a heavy emphasis on rote-learning as opposed to only learning higher-level mathematics, which is probably a good thing for performance in the long run."

France, Germany and the UK are frequently beaten by places like North Korea, Bulgaria, Hong Kong, Singapore, but when it comes down to it, the former are amongst the top 5 scientific and technology countries in the world.

math,3dhef1,PredictsYourDeath,18,Thu Jul 16 08:03:15 2015 UTC,"You can solve the problem by expressing the transitions between different values of c as a Markov chain and computing its stationary distribution, which is a linear algebra problem.  Imagine a simpler example: you have a 50% base chance to crit, and you acquire a skill that increases this all the way to 100% after a failure. Then you'll spend 2/3 of the time having c=50% and 1/3 of the time having c=100%. That's the stationary distribution. From there, you can calculate that the expected value of c is 67% (2/3).  Now, in this example, should you prefer that skill, or a flat increase of c to 67%? It depends on the sort of risks you want to take. Expected value isn't everything!   If you're facing a boss and you need two critical hits in a row to survive, starting from a random state, the first skill gives you a survival probability of 1/3, while the flat increase gives you a survival probability of 4/9. So you want the flat increase. If you're facing a different boss and you need at least one critical hit out of two, the first skill gives you a survival probability of 1, while the flat increase gives you a survival probability of 8/9. So you want the first skill.   Yes, you could also try a differential equation for the approximate probability distribution of c. I'm not sure how to get the right behavior for c near 1, though."

math,3dhef1,Zabren,7,Thu Jul 16 15:45:12 2015 UTC,"This requires only basic ideas of probability, but it also requires a lot of creative thinking. The explanation will be quite long, so bear with me until the end. :)  First: I do not know how to answer your question. So I will try to answer a similar question: what is the expected number of hits I need before I land my first critical? Let's solve for the flat increase case because that's easy.  You have a c+x probability of landing a critical on each hit (I'm taking c and x to be numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive). Therefore, the expected number of hits for a critical in the flat increase case is 1/(c+x).  Now for the expected number of hits in the varying case. I will define a random variable X_i, which equals i if the first critical appears on the ith hit and 0 otherwise. As an example, suppose that your first critical happened on the 4th hit; then we have X_1 = 0, X_2 = 0, X_3 = 0, X_4 = 4, X_5 = 0, etc. Now I define the random variable X, which equals the number of hits it took to reach the first critical. If the first critical happens on the 4th hit, then X = 4. Notice something though: I can write X as  X = X_1 + X_2 + ...  That's because if the first critical happens on the nth hit, then X_n = n, all the other X_i's are 0, and we get X = n as we should. What we're looking for is the expected value of X, and expected value is linear, so we have:  E(X) = E(X_1) + E(X_2) + ...  It's a lot easier to find each of the E(X_i)'s; since X_i takes on a value of either i or 0, then E(X_i) = i*(probability that first critical lands on ith hit). What is the probability that the first critical happens on the ith hit? You actually said it yourself:  P(i) = (1 - c)(1 - c - 0.01) ... (1 - c - 0.01(i-1))  Therefore E(X_i) is just that probability multiplied by i.  E(X_i) = i(1 - c)(1 - c - 0.01) ... (1 - c - 0.01(i-1))  And we note that the last possible term is when i = 101-100c, because at the (101-c)th step, your critical has increased to 1. Finally, the formula for E(X) becomes:  http://i.imgur.com/35g0e6I.png  It's ugly but you can use a computer to evaluate it. Sorry if I made any mistakes along the way :("
math,3dhef1,persipacious,3,Thu Jul 16 09:12:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, it looks like you're focusing on the expected time to crit, while I was focusing on the expected number of crits per time. Now that I read the OP again, it's not actually clear which is the measure of interest."

math,3dhef1,persipacious,3,Thu Jul 16 09:26:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the responses! I guess I'm chiefly interested in the ""crit chance"" after taking the skill. There's obviously a bit of variability in the rate due to the way the crit chance is modified over time, but if you average it out to say ""crit chance is the number of attacks out of 100 you expect, on average, to be critical hits"" then it's all about the crit chance for the current hit.  Another way to frame the problem might be ""after taking the skill, assuming the base crit chance is 'c', if I were to freeze the game at any random point in time, what would I expect the value of 'c' to be?""  I was just looking into Markov chains the other day after the recent exposure to subreddit simulator made by the new reddit admin working on mod tools. Then I started seeing it everywhere (what's the term for that again?). Popped in a gaming thread the other day where somebody used Markov chains to generate new cards for the game ""Hearthstone."" So I was quite surprised to see them mentioned here, although in hindsight the comparison seems obvious :)  This is surprisingly difficult thing to calculate! I do not expect the game has made this deliberately mathematically balanced; acquiring the skill requires investing a lot of resources in other skills first, and there is an alternative path that ends with a skill that yields a flat increase in crit chance. So if we were designing the game, what would the initial value of 'c' and the flat increase of 'x' need to be in order to produce the same number of expected critical hits per 1000 attacks after acquiring either skill?"
math,3dhef1,pfunkmort,2,Thu Jul 16 09:50:32 2015 UTC,"This type of choice is often impacted by things like the inherent crit chances of certain abilities and classes and stat distribution on items. Often (not always), in a vacuum, one skill set will be better than another, but they're typically made to synergize with specific builds and playstyles. What top comment says about both having advaNtages depending on the types of consistency you need in fights is important.  I'm not trying to veer this from being a math conversation, but you need to be very aware of the interplay between stats, abilities and encounters before you start making absolute assertions about ability hierarchy."
math,3dhef1,persipacious,2,Thu Jul 16 11:17:14 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I did statistics, so I might be totally wrong here. But couldn't you find the expected value like I did, and then take 1/E(X) to be the crit chance per hit?"

Then, since finding 1/(c+x) is such an easy calculation, it would be simple enough to create another table and find out the x-values corresponding to each c-value.

(Even if it is 2k - 1, rather than 2k + 1, the result would still be an odd number so perhaps this is not an issue.)  So assuming that there are 2k - 1 cases where the higher number is k, I don't understand how that proves the sum of the first n consecutive odd numbers is n2  I can see that the fraction of rolls where k would be the higher number is (2k - 1) / n2, where k < n or k = n.

The number of ways that the max roll over all die is i (1 <= i <= k) is equal to the number of possible rolls with an i sided die ( in ) minus the number of possible rolls with an i-1 sided die ( (i-1)n ) .  If we sum over all possible i, weight by i (the face value) and divide by the number of possible rolls ( kn ) we get our formula for the expected value:  ( 1/kn ) ( SUM{i=1 to i=k} of [ i * (in - (i-1)n ) ] )  But we can simplify!  Let's split the sum into ( 1/kn ) ( SUM (i=1 to i=k) of [ in+1 ] - SUM(i=1 to i=k-1) of [ in * (i+1) ] ) Notice that in the second summation i've shifted the bounds down by 1, replaced i with i+1 and thrown out the first term since it will always be 0.  If we distribute (i+1) in the second summation and split it again we get   ( 1/kn ) ( SUM (i=1 to i=k) of [ in+1 ] - SUM(i=1 to i=k-1) of [ in+1 ] - SUM(i=1 to i=k-1) of [ in ] )  Our first two summations cancel out except for the last term of the first summation, leaving us with  ( 1/kn ) ( kn+1  - SUM(i=1 to i=k-1) of [ in ] )  we distribute to get  F(n, k) = k - (SUM(i=1 to i=k-1) of [ in ])/kn  As was already found, we can check that F(2, 6) = 6 - (SUM(i=1 to i=5) of [ i2 ])/62 = 4.47222"

math,3dkz1w,doctorbong,11,Fri Jul 17 03:09:04 2015 UTC,"Super broad impossible to answer question! But, sure, I'll bite.   Algebra is about manipulating expressions according to rules. In most cases, the goal is to solve equations. Trigonometry is about manipulating the sin and cos function in different, increasingly confusing ways, most of which end up being useful for scientific applications. Calculus (of single variable functions) is about studying the real number system and functions thereof. In particular, differential calculus studies the rates of change of (piecewise) continuous functions. Integral calculus is about making cumulative functions. Multivariable calculus expands the tools of single variable calculus to work on multivariable functions, e.g. functions in three dimensional space. Mathematical analysis is what calculus becomes at higher levels. You prove all the theorems in calculus in a more general setting, thus allowing you to do calculus in more settings than just the real numbers. Differential equations is about solving equations involving the derivative operation in calculus. ""Solving equations"" here means you end up with a function, not a number. So, for example, the differential equation governing the movement of some physical object can be solved to get a function describing its position at any future time. Abstract algebra is the study of what happens when you change the rules of plain old regular algebra, thus allowing it to be used in different situations. For example, I can write (and solve) equations where the objects are braids, instead of numbers. Or equations about movements of a dodecahedron, or a Rubik's Cube. Category theory is the study of different systems of mathematics, and how they relate to one another. This is meta as fuck and makes me feel like I should break rocks for a living. I quit after my professor called Yoneda's Lemma ""kind of obvious."" Combinatorics is an umbrella term for lots of little subdisciplines of math, most of which involve how to count the number of ways a certain situation can occur. Combinatorics and ""discrete mathematics"" are pretty much the same thing, though the latter term can also be applied to some types of algebra. Probability is the monstrous lovechild of analysis and combinatorics. Essentially, you're counting ""possible futures"" to find out how likely something is to happen, which can be complicated when the number of possible futures isn't finite.   That's all the disciplines I feel like writing about for now. If you have any more you want to talk about let me know! Your question is kind of like asking what every book in the world is about so it has to be narrowed down a little bit."

I (and many other statisticians) would relate statistics and probability as follows:  Probability is when you assume some distribution and wish to derive properties of it, such as its moments and other such values of interest for more general processes. The goal might roughly be described as: what could we say about a process generated from these assumptions?  Statistics is when you are given a dataset; it'll be very messy and at the research level there are not existing methods to analyze these data. We now need to make a chain of justified assumptions about these data so they fit some probabilistic model, after which we can use the tools from probability theory.   In a way they are sort of duals of each other."

Thanks, again!!"
math,3dkz1w,elseifian,2,Fri Jul 17 22:20:39 2015 UTC,"That's a much clearer question which gives more context for an answer.  First, a little bit of context to understand how information relates: the math curriculum through calculus in the US (given the way you asked, I'm guessing you're in the US) consists of a series of topics (often algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, with the details and order varying a bit by school) that are designed around pedagogical rather than academic priorities.  That is, the course high schools call algebra isn't primarily a coherent topic, it's a bundle of ideas that are taught together based on some combination of students being old enough and prepared to understand them, how much they're needed in later courses (and in science courses).  So while there are big themes that are consistent, the details vary from school to school, and there isn't exactly a single unifying goal.  Nonetheless, I'll try to describe the big themes below.  That changes after calculus.  (Basically, everything up to calculus is aimed at preparing student to potentially be scientists or engineers; after that you have a much smaller group of students with different goals.)  After that, courses are generally much more closely tied to the modern fields that mathematicians study, and so they tend to be organized conceptually the mathematicians think about the topics.  Algebra: Algebra is about working with numbers which you've named, but where you don't actually know the value.  For instance, you might call a number whose value you're trying to find 'x', or you might be talking about a geometric shape and call the height 'h'.  But even when you can still talk about other numbers related to 'x', like 'x+1' or 'x+x'.  The goal is to be able to work with numbers abstractly, rather than just doing calculations with particular numbers; this is the basis for everything that comes later in math.  Trig: Trig is about the geometry of triangles and circles.  This sounds really specialized, but it turns out that triangles and circles are pretty important in engineering and physics.  There are some special functions related to triangles, called sine and cosine, and you spend a lot of time on their properties.  Calculus: In part, calculus is about studying functions abstractly the same way algebra is about studying numbers abstractly.  Before calculus, you usually think about particular functions, but in calculus you have to start thinking about unknown functions.  There are two big sub-topics.  Differential calculus studies how functions change; the 'derivative' of a function called 'f' is a new function which tells you 'how quickly is 'f' changing', and differential calculus studies how to use the derivative.  Integral calculus is the tool for looking at two graphs and finding geometric area of the space between them.  The two topics are related because it turns out that the derivative is the ""opposite"" of the integral.  Calculus is considered an important course because it's the subject most needed in engineering and the sciences.  (In fact, most calculus courses drop in a couple topics that aren't directly related but are useful in the sciences, because it's the last course many scientists take.)  Geometry: Geometry is about shapes.  It's a very general term---anything in math that's remotely about shapes counts as geometry.  Euclidian geometry is about the behavior of shapes on a flat plane---it's about lines, circles, triangles, and so on, and how they can relate to each other.  (A middle or high school course called 'geometry' is almost certainly about Euclidian geometry.)  Non-euclidian geometry is about the same sorts of things as euclidian geometry, but where the world you're thinking about isn't flat; for instance, spherical geometry thinks about lines and circles and so on drawn on the surface of a big sphere, where they behave very differently than if they were drawn on a plane.  Non-euclidian geometry isn't typically a course; it's neither in the ordinary up-to-calculus curriculum nor exactly a field of math in its own right.  It shows up, usually in more general geometry courses, and some colleges offer courses in it because it's a topic students find interesting which can be made accessible to first- or second-year college students.  ""Discrete geometry"" and ""differential geometry"" are actual fields of modern mathematics, so they're very different than anything else on your list.  ""Discrete"" is a word mathematicians used to mean ""the pieces are separated from each other"" (the opposite is ""continuous"", which means that very near any piece, you can find other pieces; for example, the real numbers are continuous but the integers are discrete).  So discrete geometry is a field of math that studies geometry where you look at a finite number of distinct points and ask about the shapes you can make with only those points as the corners (or only those points as the centers of circles).  ""Differential geometry"" is about non-euclidian geometry where the sorts of surfaces you think about can be quite complicated (thinking about how drawing lines on a donut is different from a sphere gets you started, though the surfaces considered get much more abstract).  In order to make the subject manageable, you only allow surfaces where differential calculus still makes sense, though.  (Among other benefits, this shows up in advanced physics, because physics suggests that the universe may actually be a non-euclidian space of exactly this kind.)"

It is possible that at some later stage in your career, you will want to specialize a bit more -- and sometimes this is partly for strategic reasons. If you want people to write good reference letters for you, it can be helpful if you have one pet area of mathematics that's ""yours"", and that other people can say you are strong in.

You can create surfaces as z=f(x,y) or by parametrizing them as X(u,v), Y(u,v), Z(u,v).  Unfortunately I don't think there's a built-in way to produce curves from equations, but you can just set the range for one parameter to zero and then convert the ""1D mesh"" to a curve. This won't take manually placed line segments and determine equations from them either, but that's not exactly hard once you know the coordinates of the endpoints.  Then again, I'm not sure what you want. Do you want software that does the raytracing and gives you equations of lightrays at the same time? Any 3D modelling software will have the option of rendering through raytracing, but specifying particular lines with equations and meshes is something you'd have to do manually."

math,3deeu6,functor7,4,Thu Jul 16 10:39:16 2015 UTC,"Since 102k+1 is 1 mod 4, it can be written as a sum of squares, and the number of ways it can be written as a sum of squares depends on it's prime factorization. If 102k+1 = A2+B2, then since 102k+1 is odd, one of these must be even and the other odd, so assume 102k+1=(2N)2+(2M-1)2.  Your formula means we can take a= N+10k/2 and b=M. This gives all the possible solutions to this kind of problem in any even base.  For k=4, 108+1 = 17x5882353, both of which are 1 mod 4, so there are two ways to write this number as a sum of (positive) squares:   108+1 = 10,0002 + 12 108+1 = 88242+47052   In the first case, N=5,000 and M=1, so a=10,000 and b=1. Not surprising. In the second case, N=4412 and M=2353. So a=9412 and b=2353. Note that 94122+23532=94,122,353  EDIT: If you also look at the negative solutions to 102k+1=A2+B2, then you get more numbers such as this. For instance, if I have 108+1 = (-8824)2+47052 then you get a=588 and b=2353 and you get 5882+23532=5,882,353.

math,3dc1oj,ahoff,15,Wed Jul 15 02:33:55 2015 UTC,"Summary of tips:   Split up equalities into inequalities. Give yourself an epsilon of room. Decompose or approximate a rough or general object by a smoother or simpler one. If one needs to flip an upper bound to a lower bound or vice versa, look for a way to take reflections or complements. Uncountable unions can sometimes be replaced by countable or finite unions. If it is difficult to work globally, work locally instead. Be willing to throw away an exceptional set. Draw pictures and try to build counterexamples. Try simpler cases first. Abstract away any information that you believe or suspect to be irrelevant. Exploit Zeno’s paradox: a single epsilon can be cut up into countably many sub-epsilons. If you expand your way to a double sum, a double integral, a sum of an integral, or an integral of a sum, try interchanging the two operations. Pointwise control, uniform control, and integrated (average) control are all partially convertible to each other. If the conclusion and hypotheses look particularly close to each other, just expand out all the definitions and follow your nose. Don’t worry too much about exactly what \varepsilon (or \delta, or N, etc.) needs to be.  It can usually be chosen or tweaked later if necessary. Once one has started to lose some constants, don’t be hesitant to lose some more. One can often pass to a subsequence to improve the convergence properties. A real limit can be viewed as a meeting of the limit superior and limit inferior."

math,3ddj75,oighen,23,Wed Jul 15 12:44:20 2015 UTC,"""The term ""manifold"" comes from German Mannigfaltigkeit, by Riemann. In Romance languages, this is translated as ""variety"" – such spaces with a differentiable structure are called ""analytic varieties"", while spaces with an algebraic structure are called ""algebraic varieties"". In English, ""manifold"" refers to spaces with a differentiable or topological structure, while ""variety"" refers to spaces with an algebraic structure, as in algebraic varieties. [...] The name manifold comes from Riemann's original German term, Mannigfaltigkeit, which William Kingdon Clifford translated as ""manifoldness"". In his Göttingen inaugural lecture, Riemann described the set of all possible values of a variable with certain constraints as a Mannigfaltigkeit, because the variable can have many values. He distinguishes between stetige Mannigfaltigkeit and diskrete Mannigfaltigkeit (continuous manifoldness and discontinuous manifoldness), depending on whether the value changes continuously or not. As continuous examples, Riemann refers to not only colors and the locations of objects in space, but also the possible shapes of a spatial figure. Using induction, Riemann constructs an n-fach ausgedehnte Mannigfaltigkeit (n times extended manifoldness or n-dimensional manifoldness) as a continuous stack of (n−1) dimensional manifoldnesses. Riemann's intuitive notion of a Mannigfaltigkeit evolved into what is today formalized as a manifold. Riemannian manifolds and Riemann surfaces are named after Bernhard Riemann.""(source) History of manifolds and varieties on Wikipedia  ""In 1871, Richard Dedekind introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers which is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the German word Körper, which means ""body"" or ""corpus"" (to suggest an organically closed entity),(source) hence the common use of the letter K to denote a field.

math,3deqym,TheBattleBot,5,Wed Jul 15 19:02:05 2015 UTC,"That's a wonderful question, and probably pretty accurate to real life!  If an average girl and an average guy view each other, the girl can assume there's an 80% chance he'll be swiping right.  Now, even if she really doesn't care about matches, and values them the same as future swipes (which is ridiculous, and would defeat the purpose of using Tinder), the utility of swiping right is still greater than the utility of swiping left.    Ur = P(M) * Um - P(L) * Us = 0.8*1 - 0.2*1 = 0.6. Ul = 0 (always)   Basically, the girl should always swipe right.  For the guy, if he knows there's a 20% chance of a match if they swipe right, he would need to value his matches at least 4 times as much as he values his swipes for it to make sense to swipe right.  Ur = P(M) * Um - P(L) * Us 0 = 0.2* Um - 0.8 * 1 0.8 = 0.2*Um Um = 4   It's fair to say that most guys will value their matches 4 times as much as their swipes.

(This isn't a rock solid proof, but it's pretty convincing, and the main thrust of it could be turned into a proof with a little bit of induction magic).  We'll say k = 4, just for concreteness sake.  But instead of looking directly at a sum like sum(i = 1, n) i4, (I'll get back to it, in a roundabout way) look at...  sum(i = 1, n) i^5 - (i - 1)^5.   Call that whole mess S.   It should be pretty clear that S is going to be a collapsing sum.  (15 - 05 ) + (25 - 15 ) + (35 - 25 ) + ... + ((n-1)5 - (n - 2)5 ) + (n5 - (n - 1)5 )  The last term in each pair cancels out with the first term in the previous pair.   And so you're left with just 15 + n5.  So, S = sum(i=1, n) i5 - (i - 1)5 = 15 + n5  That's part 1.  Another way of looking at that same sum, is to expand out the (i - 1)5 bit.  Which will give  S = sum(i = 1, n) i^5 - (i^5 - 5i^4 + 10i^3 - 10i^2 + 5i - 1)   The positive and negative i5  cancel and you have...  S = sum(i = 1, n) 5i^4 - 10i^3 + 10i^2 - 5i + 1   That whole mess is equal to the 1 + n5 that we had up above, at the end of part 1. (From here on out, I'm just going to type E, to represent ""sum(i = 1, n)"".  Because these summations are all nice and linear and additive and all that jazz, we can break it up into parts.  S = 5 E(i^4) - 10 E(i^3) + 10 E(i^2) - 5 E(i) + E(1)  = 1 + n^5   I'll spare you the busywork from here on out, but, if you've already convinced yourself that E(i3 ) is a 4th degree poloynomial, and E(i2 ) is 3rd degree, and such... then you ought to be able to see that if you move everything except for the E(i4 ) over to the right hand side of the equation, then you'll have   E(i^4) = (1/5) [1 + n^5 + (some messy 4th degree polynomial)].      Or rather, E(i4 ) = 5th degree polynomial  Edit:  Looks like I made a mistake in saying S = 1 + n5, initially... Shoudl've just been S = n5.   But that doesn't really change any of the big picture stuff."

The most common way to do this in practice is the Miller-Rabin primality test.  Miller-Rabin basically works by testing whether the given number satisfies Fermat's little theorem. But if that's all it did, then of course the algorithm would get fooled into thinking all Carmichael numbers were prime. So Miller-Rabin uses a clever way of doing two tests simultaneously: one Fermat test that catches the non-Carmichael composites, and a different test that catches all non-prime-powers. Carmichael numbers can't be prime powers, so Miller-Rabin detects all composite numbers."

I wasn't trying to alienate i, I was trying to familiar-ate negative probabilities: mathematicians once viewed i as something different, something strange, and then we became comfortable with it as we were exposed to it more and more.

Does it hurt to assume for the sake of physics that space and time are a continuum? No it doesn't, that gives good approximations, but that doesn't mean that it is. Moreover, there is no experiment that I know of to show that from an arbitrary starting point you end up at the point ""Pi.""

Knowing that the equation of a circle is described by the relation x2 + y2 = r2 doesn't help you one bit, since you'll need to test out all pairs of (x,y) to get to know which ones work  However, consider the parametrized version:  (x, y) = (r cos(theta), r sin (theta))  Now, this equation gives you a way to figure out the points on the circle in a finite amount of time  (Finite is important, here. It relates to the Halting Problem if we allow infinite time)  So, I personally think of the former as an equation, and the latter as a formula / algorithm, since it teaches you explicitly how to get those points on the circle"

math,3df32w,BigBucksGentleman,3,Wed Jul 15 19:44:38 2015 UTC,"There's a big unspoken assumption in the problem, which is what makes this confusing.  The implicit assumption is that your friend is picking the flavors randomly, with each possibility having the same probability, but the problem doesn't actually specify what the possibilities are.  In fact, both answers could be right, depending on how you fill in the details.  I'm assuming that the scoops themselves are unordered---you get a cup with two scoops, indistinguishable other than flavor.  (In other words, {c,s} and {s,c} really are the same option.)  So there are 6 possible outcomes of the process.  If your friend considered the six possible outcomes and picked one at random, then you have a 1/6 change of getting that combo.  If instead the guy first selected one of the three flavors at random, and then picked a second flavor at random independently of the first choice, you have a 2/9 chance of getting that combo.  In that case, even though there are 6 possible outcomes, they weren't equally likely, because the process used didn't give each of the 6 possible outcomes the same probability.  But the problem is actually way underspecified, because we really have no idea what process the guy used.  Maybe he's a choco-phile who was certain to pick chocolate for one scoop, and there was a 1/3 chance he'd pick strawberry for the other."

Is a bad one, unfortunately spread in part by badly written discrete math questions that go around assuming everything is equally likely.)  If you need to answer the question. You can turn to Bayesianism; you'd need to decide on an a priori distribution over ways he might have picked the scoops. Basically, if you don't know, you can't just make up how he did it, you have to treat how it as an unknown that has its own probability. You're leaving the realm of rigorous math and entering the land of practical statistical inference at that point. (There's nothing wrong with that!)  I'm not sure what that a priori distribution would be, but I'd guess that there's at least a non-zero chance of both methods, so the best answer might be somewhere between 1/6 and 2/9."
math,3df32w,elseifian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:04:14 2015 UTC,"It all depends on how the clerk chose the scoops.  If they picked one scoop at random, then another scoop independently at random, they were in effect selecting a permutation (with a 1/9 chance of each outcome), so it would be 2/9. If, on the other hand, they rolled a six-sided die and selected one of the six combinations based on that, it would be 1/6.  On a related note, how should you count the number of possible two-scoop ice creams?  That is, how should the clerk make the decision?  That depends on whether order matters:  If the two scoops sit next to each other in the bowl, vanilla+chocolate and chocolate+vanilla are the same thing (just turn around the bowl).  So order doesn't matter, and one should count combinations. So the clerk ""should have"" rolled a die and chosen a combination, whether or not that's what they actually did.  But if this is a cone with one scoop on top of the other scoop, the order does matter: chocolate on strawberry is a different experience from strawberry on chocolate.  So then the clerk ""should have"" made two independent choices to take a permutation-with-replacement."

As /u/quantumhovercraft noted, you'd need to know about age distributions to handle the year.  It's easier if you make the simplifying assumption that each team has exactly three players in each position.  Let's also assume that February 29 doesn't exist and that birthdays are uniformly distributed.  None of these are actually true, of course.  Then the chance of, say, all three Bulls small forwards having the same birthday is (1/365)2 = 1/133225: the first player's birthday can be anything, then each of the other two has an independent 1/365 chance of being the same as the first.  Since there are five positions and any of them could give us a triple independently, the chance of a given team having a triple is 1 - (1 - 1/133225)5, which comes out to about 1/26645.  Edit: Across the whole NBA (150 team-position pairs) the chance would be 1 - (1 - 1/133225)150, or about 1/889."

math,3deqkd,math238,4,Wed Jul 15 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure what you mean by continued fraction and topological space. But I'm going to loosely interpret your question by giving the following example. Are you familiar with the p-adic numbers? We can use them to give an example of a sequence that converges to two different limits in two different topologies. Here is the quick overview for now if you aren't familiar with them:  The rational numbers have their standard absolute value function that we know and love. This defines a topology on the rational Q (since absolute values define metrics which in turn define topologies), and this is just the standard topology on Q. There are a lot of little holes here, where the irrational numbers ""should"" be. So we can ""complete Q with respect to the standard metric"" to fill in all of these holes. This gives us the real numbers R.  What if we chose a different absolute value on Q, though? Are there any more absolute value-type functions? Yes, there are, one for every prime number p. (You can look up the precise definition of an absolute value function if you'd like. Basically it needs to be multiplicative and subadditive). OK, so how do we construct these?  Fix a prime number p. Every rational number can be uniquely written in the form pn*a/b where n is an integer, maybe negative, and p does not divide a or b. Now define the p-adic absolute value of the rational number pn*a/b to be p-n.  Example: If p = 5 and q = 18/50 = 5-2*9, then the p-adic absolute value of q is 52 = 25.  (NB: The standard absolute value, the trivial absolute value, and the p-adic absolute values are the only possible absolute values on Q, up to scaling. This is known as Ostrowski's theorem.)  Great, now we have a new metric on Q, the p-adic metric. It turns out that this one has some holes in it, and we can complete it in the same way we did with the standard metric, and this gives us the p-adic numbers, usually denoted Qp.  Now consider the sequence of rational numbers an = 2n/(1-2n). We want to figure out what the limit as n goes to infinity of this sequence is.  Well, limit in what sense? Remember the definition of limits in a metric space: We say that a sequence an tends to L if the distance |an - L| tends to 0 as n tends to infinity.  But now this is getting interesting! The definition of limit depends on the choice of metric on the space. Since we have two different metrics on Q, we might get two different limits!  Indeed, in this case, we do. With respect to the standard metric, this sequence converges to 1. However, with respect to the 2-adic metric, this sequence actually converges to 0! Can you see why?"

Here's some reading that I conjured up in a hurry, but hopefully this is helpful.  A few years ago, a paper from Andresscu et al (Titu Andresscu was one of the USA IMO coaches) did a pretty detailed review and comparison of how gender and ethnicity are represented in top-level math contests (mostly focused on American competitions, but also including IMO). They conclude that female under-representation in countries like the USA is likely ""due to socio-cultural, educational, or other environmental factors"", and even have a few proposals for improvement.  Another paper from MIT researchers takes a more descriptive approach and specifically focuses on the American math contests, showing that not only is the gender gap magnified at the olympiad level (compared to the SAT), but also that the high-achieving female students are concentrated in a relatively small number of schools.  One social factor that likely plays a big part is that math is a field where a relatively large proportion of people think that inborn ability is necessary for success. A recent study suggests that such a belief is associated with fewer female PhDs in that field, and I suspect it also plays a part in discouraging women from studying mathematics at lower levels (even in high school)."

In brief, an argument against it is that while the phenomenon of greater variance in males does appear in many cultures, it doesn't occur in others.

Nearly everyone in the IMO community agrees that the North Koreans did not receive a fair treatment, and many would also say it was highly unclear whether they cheated at all. See this Reddit thread and the link provided in said thread for more information.    Speaking frankly, if you knew anything about the situation and/or were an honest person, you would have mentioned the controversy of North Korea's disqualification in 2010."
math,3dcwxp,SnifingSharpies,5,Wed Jul 15 07:51:59 2015 UTC,"So let's say that there is a function that tells you how much area you've collected under a function f since you left x = 0. Call this function A(x), so for any x you plug in you get the area under f(x) from 0 to x. If you think about it for a little while you can see (it's easier to see after drawing a few pictures) that the rate of change of this area function is just f itself!  So A'(x) = f(x)"

The proof that we could interpret antiderivatives as area ended when we said A'(x) = f(x) since that implies the area is an antiderivative, not the antiderivative. Any further manipulations only find a more explicit formula for the area in terms of the general antidervative."
math,3dcwxp,matho1,7,Wed Jul 15 15:43:58 2015 UTC,"A lot of introductory courses, especially at the high school level, don't do enough to distinguish between the integral and the antiderivative of a function, which is really a shame -- you end not really getting to see why the fundamental theorem of calculus is such an achievement.  The integral ∫f(x)dx from a to b with a<b is defined to be the (net) area under the curve between a and b. This is key: as far as the definitions are concerned, the integral has nothing to do with derivatives at all. The integral just tells you how much area is under the curve and that's it. And you can see that there are, for instance, a whole bunch of functions that have integrals but not derivatives. It absolutely ought to seem to you like integrals and derivatives don't have all that much to do with each other.  An antiderivative of a function f is a function F with the property that F'(x)=f(x). This definition has to do with derivatives and not integrals. There is nothing in the definition that says anything about the relationship between F and the area under f.  The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is the miraculous result that relates integrals to antiderivatives. It tells us that if f is an integrable function with an antiderivative F then the area under f from a to b is F(b) - F(a).  The point is that this shouldn't be obvious to you. It is a miraculous theorem whose discovery is one of the pinnacles of scientific thought. In fact, the fact that you're not just taking it as given that the antiderivative and the integral are equal is a good sign. It means you're thinking carefully about these things and not just taking them for granted.  Anyway, since FTC tells us that the integral and the antiderivative are very closely related, it is typical to make a few changes to the definitions. Instead of calling the area under the f from a to b just ""the integral of f"", we call it the ""definite integral of f"", and then we call the antiderivative of f ""the indefinite integral of f"". But this only makes sense to do because of the fundamental theorem of calculus -- without understanding that, there's no reason to associate antiderivatives with integrals."
math,3dcwxp,kloostermaniac,10,Wed Jul 15 10:49:42 2015 UTC,"The integral is defined as the signed area between a function and the x-axis between two given points. (Well, it's more formal than that, but that's essentially what it is.)  The antiderivative is the opposite of the derivative - a process that gives you a function if you give it the derivative. The reason antiderivatives have a +C at the end is to represent all the possibilities for constants. For example, x2 and x2 + 3 have the same derivative: 2x. So the antiderivative of 2x is x2 + C, and the C can be any number you want.  The cool thing about the integral and the antiderivative is that the seemingly unrelated concepts are actually the same thing. If you want to find the integral of y=2x from 3 to 7 (i.e. the area under 2x from 3 to 7), you can just take the antiderivative, x2 + C, at 7 and 3 and then subtract to get an answer of 40. The fact that you can do this is so important that it's called the fundamental theorem of calculus - it gives us a link between the integral (an originally geometric concept) and the antiderivative (an algebraic one)."

We can define the integral to be the signed area between the graph and the x-axis, and this is a great definition for a first course in calculus (especially reform calculus stressing conceptual/contextual understanding).

math,3dfpp7,ordieth117,2,Wed Jul 15 22:26:47 2015 UTC,"I think you might like to read about mathematical logic. It basically studies a rigorous way to say which sequences of symbols are sentences and how they are to be interpreted. One thing it says in particular is that the sentences themselves are not enough to determine meaning.  Usually mathematical logic starts by building up from the simplest possible elements and proceeds by induction. We would first define what are called terms. We start with a set of all the symbols we want to use for variables, giving each variable its type (loosely, what values the variable can take on) and a set of function symbols each of which has several input types (which inputs they can handle) and one output type. Function symbols may also have no inputs in which case they are called constants, Next we define the set of the terms by induction as follows: All variables are automatically terms, and if f is a function symbol with input types a_1, a_2 ...a_n and output type b, and x_1, x_2 ...x_n are terms with types a_1, a_2 ...a_n respectively, then f( x_1, x_2 ...x_n) is a term of type b.    Terms make up the basic nouns of your sentences but they don't necessarily point to a particular object. That happens at a later stage see here. anyway, once you have terms you build up sentences inductively using terms as your basic building blocks. I don't think I can explain it very well in a single comment but if you want to read on your own Smullyan is quite a good author when it comes to formal logic and it will be easier if you start with first-order logic which ignores types. Or if you want a more thorough explanation feel free to ask.  Hopefully that more or less answers your question.     EDIT:wrong link."

math,3dfpp7,DeathAndReturnOfBMG,2,Thu Jul 16 00:39:06 2015 UTC,"There are essentially two parts to the quadratic formula.  b2 - 4ac is called the discriminant, Δ. It tells you how many real roots there are in the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0. If Δ > 0, you have two; if Δ = 0, you have one real root (or, strictly speaking, two real roots that are equal); and if Δ < 0 then you have no real roots (both roots are complex).  -b / 2a gives you the location of the vertex (maximum or minimum) of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex is -b / 2a, and its y-coordinate is given by ax2 + bx + c for x = -b / 2a.  To see why the latter is true, note that the vertex lies halfway between the roots. Take the mean of the positive and negative forms of quadratic formula and the square roots cancel out, leaving you with just -b / 2a."

There is no single ""list of axioms"" that is the starting point for all mathematics. Mathematicians study the consequences of lots of different sets of axioms.

It might however be possible that a common set of axioms (like ZFC) cannot be true together, in which case a considerable amount of damage repair would have to be done to ensure that math in general isn't ""broken"" entirely. I'm fairly certain that even if this did happen, we would be able to find an alternate set of axioms to still do math. I say this because a) there are already multiple different systems in use and b) any real-world application of mathematics is (hopefully) consistent because our universe exists."
math,3dgf48,whirligig231,0,Thu Jul 16 03:10:05 2015 UTC,"Some conservative extensions of ZFC (like NBG) can be represented as a finite set of axioms in first order logic. This also means that they can be represented as a single axiom. A bit of a nitpick, I'm afraid, as what you said still is largely true.   Somewhat interesting in that I suppose in that means you could negate that grand axiom and look for a contradiction also. If you found one there, that would be... weird. Set theory being logically valid would be weirder to me than it being inconsistent. (It's possible you could prove the existence of a model for the negation of the grand axiom as well, making this segue pointless, but leaving the consistency question open and I'm unfortunately not versed enough in set theory to know if this question has been answered.) Nevermind... the negation must be consistent, because a logically valid ZFC is impossible, because then it can prove it's own consistency and violate the incompleteness theorem. Well that was a fun epiphany while writing a comment, though I expect not a completely novel one.  If ZFC was inconsistent, it could be something akin to Russel's paradox over a century ago. That was a big deal, but largely because it illustrated the power of impredictive statements to demolish theories and the power of self reference. If there was some similiar, recoverable inconsistency in ZFC, that would be great, because it would give us insights to make new inferences about mathematics and give rise to new answers to questions the way self reference lets us have the incompleteness theorems. But it could also be something much worse if it meant higher order logic and it's mapping to set theory fell apart in monstrous ways or if the only obvious solution was being forced into terrible bargains like paraconsistent logic or abandoning choice. Mind, I don't find it plausible at all, and I expect there's some mapping argument to be made from Gentzen's consistency proof to demonstrate why it's implausible.   While the incompleteness theorem suggests we're not allowed to argue that it's impossible for there to be a hidden inconsistency somewhere in... whatever foundation we're using at the time (ZFC, NBG, or Homotopy Type Theory today I guess) we can currently construct arguments why its very unlikely. That the possibility exists strikes me as the sort of thing that can give logicians nightmares; demons lurking in the darkness, ghost stories told around campfires of the hidden monsters at the edge of countable models, their claws ripping at the foundations."

Some exercises are straightforward, but time-consuming, while others are notoriously difficult or non-obvious.   You can easily imagine spending 2 years on a single graduate level text book without total comprehension.  But almost all math texts are intended to have some use as a reference. I don't always fully understand or remember everything I read in my books, but I have a strong sense of the general flavor of each. If I want to review some concept involving, say, rings, I might pick up any of my algebra books. Aluffi would be good for when I want a categorical explanation of things. Jacobson is nice for learning trivia not found in introductory books. Pinter and Gallium are good for very basic explanations, but I have to keep in mind their rings are really rngs. If I actually needed to know something about ideals or modules, maybe Atiyah MacDonald is the better place to look.  I do not have a PhD, nor am I a grad student yet, but I don't believe you need very expansive knowledge to make contributions to mathematics. More importantly is mastery of one subject with mere exposure to some others for perspective.   But certainly I don't need to know about every branch in depth.

math,3ddbd7,Bollu,2,Wed Jul 15 11:13:14 2015 UTC,"First of all: is equation (2) legal? The derivative operator isn't a Hermitian operator; you can't just act with it to the left or right at your whim. More properly, you could find this expression by expanding the product rule due to the derivative acting on the full braket.  Second of all, the delta function is a distribution, not a differentiable function per se. In practice, this means that finding properties of the delta function like it's distributional derivative needs to be done by integrating the delta function against some anonymous test function, and then pulling the resulting distribution back out.  Anyway, according to Wikipedia, you can differentiate the delta function essentially using the good old difference formula.  Now, I'm sure there's a special kind of physicist hell in /r/math for the procedure I'm about to suggest, but if you flip the sign of x in that difference formula and note that the delta function is even, then to recover the difference formula on the RHS you ""must"" flip the sign of h. Hence, your minus sign. (Actually, that's no so crazy; this is true of any even function, and it's easy to imagine.)"

math,3ddbd7,danielsmw,2,Wed Jul 15 11:38:46 2015 UTC,"I can expand on what I meant, which was to commute the integral and derivative and demand that the integrand vanish. But, in retrospect, I see that (in addition to that possibly not being a legal commutation in the first place) it doesn't really get you to the result that you want.  However, I'm actually starting to feel better about the formalization potential of the ""proof"" I gave. If you write down the(distributional) difference formula for evaluating delta(-x), use the evenness property of the delta function, and change the dummy limiting variable from h to (-h), you get precisely the negation of the difference formula for delta(x). I believe those are all legal manipulations."

math,3d9y90,jgardner,-5,Tue Jul 14 19:59:07 2015 UTC,"EDIT: What is with all the down-modding? I challenge anyone to provide a single thing I've said in this post that is not 100% correct. Unlike most of the answers given, that are either complete nonsense/incorrect or give answers that don't really address the simple reason why division by zero is not meaningful, this post clearly explains (in very simple terms) why division by zero is not meaningful. No wonder Reddit is going to shut down. It is full of dipshits who don't know their ass from a hole in the ground. People downmodding posts like this are retards, and probably child molesters too! (Let the down mods begin)!  Short answer: No. Longer Answer:  What is division? Division means, ""How many time can I subtract a number from another number until there is nothing left?"" Think about it for a moment if you disagree (I have a pile of 100 Apples and I want to divide it into piles of 10 apples each. How many piles will there be? 100 - 10 = 90 (1 pile), 90 - 10 = 80 (2 piles), ... 10 - 10 = 0 (10 piles). The answer is 10.). Now, given that we agree that a/b (a divided by b) means, ""How many times can I subtract b from a until there is nothing remaining in a, then ask yourself this, ""What does a/0 mean?"". Think about it for a moment - ""How many times can I subtract 0 from a until there is nothing left?"". Well, I can subtract 0 forever (infinity) and I will still have ""a"" remaining. I will NEVER have nothing left no matter how many times I subtract 0. So, there is no meaningful answer. And so a/0 is ALWAYS undefined (not infinity like some will try to say is the answer). Remeber, a/b does not mean ""How many times can I subtract b from a?"", it means ""How many times can I subtract b from a until there is nothing left in a (a becomes zero)?"" With that definition, the only sensible thing for division by zero is ""Undefined/Not Meaningful"". It's kind of like asking, ""How blue is up?"" It's not a meaningful question."

math,3d9y90,leftexact,-5,Tue Jul 14 21:35:26 2015 UTC,"As someone else curious about the conceptual thought in mathematics here is what I have gathered. Axiomization of zero is variant given the field of mathmetics, so your question seems to be too broad. In algebra 0 is a place holder, as in a digit of no value. So a digit of value, like a rational number, divided by ""no value"" is no value e.g. a pizza can't be shared if there is no one there to share it.   A definition of zero as the absence of something(s), like the empty set in set theory, is not necessarily nothing because being a set gives it qualities. But again, this is not the most informed view, and I'm certain there is more to be said. So  I don't think there is a canonical zero to be addressed in all of mathematics to answer your question. If you specify more what you're looking for someone better equipped can answer you."

One could say that the pirates resolve the ambiguity in favor of chucking the cheapskate senior pirate off board simply to ensure that he won't be a cheapskate in the first place because he realizes that's gonna be his fate, so the ambiguous situation will never arise and more money will be shared. Then the 3rd rule has materialized simply out of greed for money, not from some irrational inherent desire to kill.

Supposing there are just 100 gold pieces, then:  Pirate #201 as captain can stay alive only by offering all the gold to odd-numbered pirates, keeping none.  Pirate #202 as captain can stay alive only by offering all the gold to even-numbered pirates, keeping none.  Pirate #203 as captain will not have enough gold available to bribe a majority, and so will die.  Pirate #204 as captain has #203's vote secured without bribes: #203 will only survive if #204 also survives. So #204 is safe by making the same offer as #201 would make, bribing the first 100 odd-numbered pirates, who will get nothing from #202 if #204 and #203 both die.  Because #204 is safe, #203 doesn't care if #205 dies, so #205 is doomed as captain, and likewise #206 and #207.  The votes of self-preservation from #205, #206, and #207 are enough to ensure the safety of #208, #208 makes the same offer as #202 would make, bribing the first 100 even-numbered pirates, who will get nothing from #204 if #208 to #205 all die.  In general, if G is the number of gold pieces and N (> 2G) is the number of pirates, then no pirate whose number exceeds 2G can expect any gold. Further:  All pirates whose number is less than or equal to 2G + M will survive, where M is the highest power of 2 that does not exceed N – 2G.  Any pirates whose number exceeds 2G + M will die.  The gold will go to those of the first 2G pirates whose numbers have the opposite parity to log2 M (that is, the odd numbers if M is an even power of 2; the even numbers if M is an odd power of 2).  Another way to see this is to realize that every Mth pirate will have the vote of all the pirates from M/2 to M out of self preservation, and will lose the vote of every pirate from 2G to M/2, since their survival is secured with the survival of the M/2th pirate. Because the highest ranking pirate can break the tie, the captain only needs the votes of half of the pirates over 2G, which happens at every power of 2 from 2G onwards."

It's plain to see from the 3 pirate situation. The last pirate knows that if the game continues until there are only two pirates remaining, then he will receive no gold. 0% chance. So he's definitely happy getting 1 gold.  Skipping a few inductive steps to the final solution, look at Pirate E in the 7 pirate situation. If he chucks the first option, he knows that Pirate B will do a split where he does not get any gold at all, and he knows that the other pirates will accept (being in similar situations themselves). Voting no is a 0% chance of receiving any gold. So he votes yes."

math,3d62kq,Seventytvvo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:21:32 2015 UTC,"This assumes there's no collusion among the lower ranking pirates. If they are all greedy, then they will collude and work together to try to maximize their shares. In your example, this should lead to a tendency to simply vote ""no"" against any pirate who's more senior offering you a cut. The senior-most pirate isn't going to try to keep 97 gold to himself when the six others can simply tell him to shove it. What if pirate B says to the others that he will split the gold equally? Then pirate A is screwed.   However, this trend of chucking the highest ranking pirate out can't last, because eventually, when two pirates are left, the higher of the two will just keep all the gold. Obviously, the lowest ranking pirate will have an incentive to prevent this and will start voting ""yes"" to some offer before then.   I don't see any reason why the other six pirates would put up with being ""divided and conquered"" by the senior pirate's strategy of offering them one piece of gold.   If the other pirates are separated and cannot communicate, then yes... this would be the optimal strategy for them (and for the highest ranking pirate)."

If the pirates can ""swear a vow"" or something, then you are right.  Let's say A proposes the solution above. Then B offers to collude with the rest of the pirates (or actually only 4 of them are needed). They all ""agree"". Then when B is most senior, there's no rational reason for him to keep his word, he would be better of proposing the solution above, because he gets more, and the remaining pirates should agree the same as above, since kicking off B makes them get 0 instead of 1.

Either the top pirate accepts, sparing his life and netting zero gold, or he refuses, nets zero gold AND dies. If this happens, the game is over, correct?   What I'm saying is that this is kind of like the prisoner's dilemma, in that it only works if the prisoners cannot communicate.

Each pirate only cares about staying alive, and money, in that order. And each pirate is perfectly logical and knows that the others are too. Therefore, if you follow the logic above, the pirates must act a certain way.  It may sound silly, but these kind of restrictions allow us to prove properties about things and can be good ways to model certain situations in real life where there is competition for resources.

He can't give away enough gold to get the majority of 102 votes, even with his own vote, and the pirates are bloodthirsty.  204 is actually okay. He gives away 100 gold pieces to pirates with odd numbers, and pirate 203 will vote for him anyway just to stay alive. But it's weird because he could give his gold pieces to any of the 101 pirates with odd numbers between 1 and 201, since all of them stand to gain nothing if 204 (and then 203) dies.  But then 205 will die, as he cannot win enough votes? And 206 as well, since even though he has 205's vote he doesn't have any others...   So will all the pirates until 205 die, and then 204 lives by giving away all his gold?  EDIT: No, this is wrong. I think 207 might get to live with 206 and 205's votes. Hm. Very interesting!  EDIT 2: I think I have it: If there are more than 200 pirates, the pirate with the largest number in the form of 200 + 2N will live by giving 100 coins to all the pirates with numbers <= 200 + 2N - 1, and getting those votes as well as those of the pirates with numbers 200 + 2N-1 < k <= 200 + 2N. All the pirates with larger numbers will be unable to save themselves. So with 500 pirates, pirate 456 = 200 + 28 lives."

math,3d62kq,Asuperniceguy,3,Mon Jul 13 21:51:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I have the right solution...  But let's say you have 2 pirates, 2 and 1.  2 will take all the coins, because 1 can't outvote him.  Let's say you have 3 pirates, 3, 2, and 1.  3 needs to get at least one of 2 and 1 to vote for him.  If 2 votes for him, he doesn't get to maximize his coins, because if 3 is eliminated, we get back to the previous case where 2 takes all the coins.  So 2 isn't going to vote for him at all.  1 knows that he won't get anything if 3 loses, so 1 will support 3 so long as he gets something.  If he gets 0, he could go either way because it won't make a difference to him.  3 doesn't want to die, so 3 will take 99, 2 will take 0, and 1 will take 1.  Let's say you have 4 pirates, 4, 3, 2, and 1.  Only one of 3, 2, and 1 needs to be convinced.  If 4 loses, 3 gets 99, so 3 is already going to be a no vote and therefore gets 0.  4 can offer 1 coin to 2, because 2 knows that he'll get 0 otherwise, and now there's support.  4 will take 99, 3 will take 0, 2 will take 1, 1 will take 0.  Let's say you have 5 pirates, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.  Two of 4, 3, 2, and 1 need to be convinced.  4 ain't getting 99 so he's a no vote.  3 can be offered just 1.  1 can also be offered just 1 because otherwise he gets 0.  So 5 gets 98, 4 gets 0, 3 gets 1, 2 gets 0, 1 gets 1.  And so on.  Eventually, 7 gets 97, 5, 3, and 1 get 1 each, and 6, 4, and 2 get 0.  6, 4, and 2 aren't happy, so they vote no.  5, 3, and 1 aren't happy either, but they'll get 0 if 7 loses so they vote yes."

math,3d62kq,gramathy,2,Mon Jul 13 21:09:46 2015 UTC,"Here's a possible solution. Note that I assume that there's 100 gold coins that cannot be divided smaller than 1. If any division is possible, my 1's will be arbitrarily small epsilon, and the big split will be the rest of the treasure.  For two pirates, the senior (pirate 2) proposes a split with himself getting 100% of the booty. It will pass with a 1-1 vote.   So in the case of three, pirate 2 will not vote yes for anything less than the full booty. But Pirate 3 can suggest a 99-0-1 split, which pirate 1 knows will be better than he will get in the two pirate case.   For four pirates, pirate 4 can implore the above logic. 99-0-0-1 will pass, assuming pirate 1 will vote yes when his share is tied with the next option (99-0-1-0 if you don't like that assumption).  For five pirates, we start to see some trouble. Needing 3 yes votes, pirate 5 needs to get 2 others to vote yes, so must give them a better split than the above possibility. This actually isn't that hard, assuming the pirates are perfectly rational: 98-0-1-1-0 seems to get a pass. Perfectly rational and ruthless, pirate 4 will propose the split in the above case, he cannot credibly ""promise"" better.   Now for 6 pirates, we will repeat 5 pirate logic. 98-0-1-0-0-1 will pass because pirates 1 and 4 know they will get 0 if the continue down to 5 pirates.   So finally for 7 pirates, the optimal split is 97-0-1-0-1-1-0. With a stable split at 6 pirates with 0 gold for pirates 5, 3, and 2, they will vote yes for any nonzero gold allocation in the 7 case."

The pirates come across X doubloons.  Doubloons cannot be split. If there is no crew, the captain takes all the doubloons and goes sailing into the sunset.

You get 99 coins. 4 pirates: Give p4 2 coins, p3 0 coins, and p2 0 coins. p4 votes for you, since otherwise he plays as p3 in the above game, and wins only 1 coin. You get half the vote this way, and 98 coins. 5 pirates: Give p5 3 coins, p4 1 coin, and p3 and p2 0 coins. p5 and p4 would play as p4 and p3 in the above game, and win only 2 and 0 coins respectively. They vote yes, and you earn 96 coins. 6 pirates: Give p6 4 coins and p4 2 coins. You get 3 votes, and 94 coins. 7 pirates: Give p7 5 coins, p6 3 coins, and p5 1 coin. p4, p3, and p2 get nothing.

Asuming all others are equal (not a reasonable assumption, they have their own pirate issues going on), If I die, they split is six ways and each get 16.666.... coins. So I suggest that three of them get 17 coins each, more than they can expect, and that I get 49. If I am aware of their situations, I pick the weakest, or lowest expecting three.

No ""fairness"" in economics), we know they will always take the best/top offer. Any combination of 7 lots the captain could offer would include himself getting a cut, unless for some reason he can disobey his own rule and deliberately offer 6 segments and negate himself from collecting anything, but we aren't told he can do that. Therefore, anything possible combo he'd offer up could always be 1-up'd by another sailor offering to divide the captains share amongst the pirates. If we can divide individual gold coins into smaller pieces, than any fragment of his share could always be divide into a better profit-maximizer combo with 6 pirates. If we can't divide the gold into smaller pieces and can only split 100 units into 7/6/5/4/3/2/1 groups, you only need 49% of the vote to get a larger cut, therefore any logical thinker would allows undercut the guy before him (seeing how it's socially acceptable for pirates) until 1 sailor is left with all the loot."

The senior pirate needs 3 other pirates to agree with the split, otherwise he gets thrown off.

math,3d62kq,ilovelegos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:39:42 2015 UTC,"Each pirate knows that the others are all ruthless and logical, so they know there's no way they're going to get more than one gold, because there's no reason for the next guy to make them a better offer.  Consider two pirates. The captain gets to keep it all, and there's nothing the other guy can do about it, because his lone vote isn't enough to reject it.  Then consider three pirates. If the captain offers the last guy even one gold, that guy will accept it knowing that he won't get any by voting to reject the offer (since the current first mate won't offer him any if he becomes captain). Thus, the captain secures enough votes to pass the offer by giving himself 99 and the last guy 1. The second pirate votes to reject it, but that doesn't matter.  With four pirates, The captain gives himself 99 and the third pirate (who would become the second pirate and get nothing if the offer was rejected) one coin. The third pirate will vote to accept because one coin is better than nothing, which is what he'll get if he rejects it. The second and fourth pirates, getting nothing, will vote to reject it, but that doesn't matter because it has the necessary two votes.  This pattern continues up to the seven pirate case (and beyond). All the pirates voting in favor know there's no scenario in which they get 25 coins, and in fact they know they'll get nothing if they vote him off, so they take their one coin because it's better than nothing.  Does that make sense?"
math,3d98q9,Kasimark,9,Tue Jul 14 14:22:06 2015 UTC,"By far my favourite ODEs text is Ordinary Differential Equations by Morris Tenenbaum.   It is thorough, clear and extremely well organized. As for online availability, I'm not sure, but it is an extremely cheap Dover book and well worth the buy.   As for PDEs, a good soft introduction to the subject would be Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers by Stanley Farlow. However, as the name implies, it is not intended for mathematicians and is less theoretical than books by Strauss, Evans and John. It is good for understanding the physical interpretation of PDEs and methods of solving them.   It is also a very inexpensive Dover book."

There is an older book by George Simmons which I consider to be a beautiful book on the topic. It is quite comprehensive covering essentially all that you'd expect an undergrad to learn about ODE and PDE, and it offers a nice look at the qualitative properties of ODE and PDE as well. It is still a bit on the computational side, but that is mostly because it is tough to get too deep into differential equations with undergrads.   Simmons, original  Simmons, what appears to be an updated version  For a book specifically on PDE, I think Strauss' book is a good treatment.   For ordinary differential equations at the undergrad level I guess HSD does a good job of teaching it, but bare in mind this is very heavily focused on systems of ODE. While that contains nth order ODEs, I think it's unfortunate to skip over the basics as 2nd order ODE have a unique flavor as well as a rich theory and history, for example the Kepler problem of celestial mechanics is a second order ODE as well as many other physical problems. My favourite reference here would be reading through Landau and Lifschitz book on mechanics, but it is a bit of a daunting task as the book does also teach quite a bit of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, which can be a bit difficult for undergrads, perhaps looking for another undergrad classical mechanics book would be preferable.  Edit: I'd put a vote for Tenenbaum as well, just looked through the topics and it seems like a nice treatment of ODE."

There are some ways of making the Dirac basis work, for example, by ""enlarging"" the usual Hilbert spaces and consider so-called rigged Hilbert spaces / Gel'fand triples. If you do that, there will be a sound mathematical basis to everything, but the price is that things become more complicated & usually notationally cumbersome. Alternatively, you can use the heuristic arguments and accept that some expressions and such will be somewhat ambiguous."

math,3d8r18,Exomnium,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:26:30 2015 UTC,"So as /u/starless_ said it might be fine but in some physics there's basically a notion of 'delta function' normalization that's the more common way to think of this issue.  For example there's something that shows up in quantum field theory a lot called a functional derivative which can basically be thought of like this: If you have a vector x_n and you take the partial derivative you get [; \frac{\partial x_n}{\partial x_m} = \delta_{nm} ;] .  So now think of a function as being a sort of continuous analog of a discrete vector and do the same thing. [; \frac{\delta f(x)}{\delta f(y)} = \delta(x-y) ;] .  You need it to be [; \delta(x-y) ;]  and not [; \delta_{xy} ;] because [; \delta_{xy} ;] is 'invisible' to an integral in that it acts exactly like 0.  This idea that ""when you change from a discrete to a continuous domain you should change Kronecker deltas to Dirac deltas"" is pretty ubiquitous in physics. And as /u/Snuggly_Person said below the best way to do these kinds of things 'more carefully' in physics is almost always to treat the delta as a limit of functions that are getting narrower and taller, always taking the limit at the end. Sometimes, like with <x|x> you'll get a divergent answer but that usually means that either you were approximating some small scale as literally 0 but you can't actually take that approximation (the first example of this you usually encounter in physics is the calculation of the self-inductance of a wire, which diverges if you take the wire thickness as 0. The actual answer ends up depending strongly on the thickness of the wire, contrary to most electromagnetism calculations in which approximating wires as 0 thickness works fine) or you are calculating something that only matters up to an arbitrary normalization anyways (such as the Feynman path integral) so you can get a meaningful answer by choosing a normalization that cancels out the divergence."

The most physical approach would probably be to do some sort of lattice/box regularization; IIRC even in some classical radiation calculations you encounter squared deltas where this is the correct approach.

In the limit A->0 the function converges to the dirac delta, and has the integration properties you expect.

So, essentially, you've ""put your system into a box"". This is something of a simplification, you need to take care of boundary conditions, continuum limits and so on, but that's the idea.   For example, in the classical ED calculation I mentioned (which is a bit closer to your case than any QFT calculations I can think of) you want to calculate the integral of something like f(ω)δ2 (ω0-ω) w.r.t ω over (a priori) R, where f is some simple function (a power of ω?). The integral is related to energy radiated in a radiation event, so you use the fact that in reality the radiation is emitted only for a finite time T. By using a certain integral representation of the Dirac delta you can calculate one of the two deltas, and transform the squared delta to something like (T/(2π))δ(ω0-ω), limit as T-> ∞, which you can then integrate. You'll be left with a power of T (I want to say just T?), but you're interested in a physical quantity which is consant × your integral / corresponding power of T, so you can get rid of the limit with a bit more hand-waving. This is off the top of my head, and obviously extremely nonrigorous[1], so don't quote me on the details. I think that specific calculation is done in Jackson.  Regularization and subsequent renormalization are extremely important concepts in quantum field theory, and you can certainly read more about it in QFT books, but here it mostly serves as a ""trick"" used to get the correct answer.  [1] Again, with rigour comes more complicated maths. Based on your reply to /u/functor7 I'm purposefully trying to stay away from the more mathematically rigorous explanations even though we're in /r/math, hence this example."

In fact one way to define the complex numbers is to just take R2 (the collection of ordered pairs of real numbers), declare that ""a+bi"" is simply another way to write ""(a,b)"", and then define operations called addition and multiplication the way we expect them to be defined (that is, a+bi + c+di = (a+c) + (b+d)i and so forth). From that you can derive all the facts about the complex numbers that we expect.  Furthermore, we can treat the real numbers as a subset of the complex numbers by associating the real number r with the complex number r+0i. Then the above operations of complex addition and multiplication preserve the addition and multiplication we already have for the real numbers."

math,3d8v5o,oim9,6,Tue Jul 14 12:39:16 2015 UTC,"In most applied math at the undergrad level, you're studying functions from one object to another. In complex analysis, the object is the complex plane.  Topologically, the real plane and the complex plane are identical. The sets that are open, closed, connected, etc. in one plane the same thing in the other plane. They're the same topological object. The only difference is how the points are labeled. (0,1) becomes i, (1,0) becomes 1, etc. This relabeling simplifies complex multiplication.  Complex analysis can be regarded as the study of a particular subset of functions with domain R2 ≈ C and range R2 ≈ C. In fact in some cases it's convenient to revert back to this real notation and treat a complex function f(z) as f(x,y) = (u(x,y), v(x,y)). The difference is entirely notational. In the ""real"" notation, complex multiplication is a map that takes ((x,y),(a,b)) to (xa - yb, xb + ya).  The reason that it's interesting to think of such functions as f(z) is partly because of the novel version of differentiability it yields: complex differentiable (what is termed ""holomorphic"") is a much stronger condition than real differentiable, so the functions that are studied in complex analysis have a lot of nice properties that real functions typically do not.  A real function R2 => R2 is differentiable if all its partial derivatives are continuous. This is not strong enough to be complex differentiable. Complex differentiable implies that du/dx = dv/dy and dv/dx = -du/dy.  This strong condition yields a lot of nice properties but is also restrictive.  I'll quote from this thread.   an infinitely differentiable function of two real variables could map a disk to an ellipse, stretching more in one direction than another. An analytic function can't do that.  A smooth function of two variables could also flip a disk over, such as f(x, y) = (x, -y). An analytic function can't do that either.   Some other nice properties / restrictions are that holomorphic functions converge to their power series (such a function is called ""analytic""), they take their maximum values on their boundary, and they preserve angles. The most interesting thing from an applied point of view is the way you can use path integrals in the plane (called ""contour"" integrals if you regard the plane as C instead of R2) to solve difficult single variable integrals.  I'm not sure how much math your circuit class uses. At a very basic level, complex variables are used mainly because they simplify the notation."
math,3d8v5o,RedditSpecialAgent,3,Tue Jul 14 17:31:07 2015 UTC,"I'm curious though what's the difference between a Cartesian plane with two real axes, and a complex plane, where one axis is real and one axis is imaginary?   The answers given so far are great. Here's my two cents.  There's no geometric difference. They are both planes. I don't think there's anything really wrong with the mental image of thinking of them as the ""same"" plane.  But you can do a bit more with complex numbers than with pairs of real numbers. Adding complex numbers is basically just like adding pairs of real numbers, but when you start multiplying complex numbers, you're ""doing more things"" with the points in that plane, and exploring a deeper and more subtle structure."
math,3d8v5o,skullturf,2,Tue Jul 14 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"Good answers so far, here's another crack at putting it slightly differently:  In the usual way of thinking, yes, the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers. A real number has zero imaginary component.  Comparing the set of complex numbers and the 2-dimensional real plane is a little subtler. There is definitely a simple 1-1 correspondence between the two sets, with (x, y) ↔ x + iy. The more interesting question is whether they are isomorphic, i.e., whether the operations carry over across the correspondence too. They are isomorphic with addition: (a, b) + (c, d) = (a+c, b+d) and (a + ib) + (c + id) = (a+c) + i(b+d).  Multiplication is the tricky one. The natural form of multiplication on the real plane is dot product, yielding a real number, and the natural form of multiplication for complex numbers is just regular multiplication, yielding a complex number. Those aren't corresponding operations and they don't make an isomorphism.  Multiplying two complex numbers does have a relation to plane geometry, though. (a + ib) can be rewritten in the form r (cos t + i sin t) and from there, you can see that multiplying two complex numbers yields a complex number with the product of magnitudes and the sum of angles. And that means you can get a linear transformation consisting of any combination of rotation and scaling by multiplying by the appropriate complex number. For example, i * z yields z rotated by 90 degrees. Those transformations can also be expressed as 2x2 real matrices, so there is an isomorphism between complex numbers and a subset of 2x2 real matrices over both + and *."

math,3d8v5o,_forgetful_functor_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:59:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take a different route to explaining this, and say that one issue I think is confusing you is a matter of context, while the other is a matter of bookkeeping.  To answer the first, and bigger, problem, the difference between what is meant when someone says ""the Cartesian plane"" and ""the complex plane"" isn't that the Cartesian plane has ""real axes"" and the complex plane has an ""imaginary"" one. I'd argue it's that you think of being able to do different operations in each of them. If we're talking about a Cartesian plane, there's a good chance we're talking about its elements as ""vectors"", and doing things like adding, subtracting, taking dot products, and drawing lines. If we're talking about the complex plane, we can draw them like vectors of course, but we can multiply elements in there, too; of course we can define the same multiplication structure on the Cartesian plane, and that's why this is just a matter of context, but generally I'd say we don't.  The Cartesian plane models geometry, which is exactly why multiplication usually isn't defined for it (what does the product of two lines look like?). Also, a lot of concepts defined in it make sense in any Euclidean space (i.e. some [; \mathbb{R}^n ;], like, say, 3D geometry): dot products, taking linear combinations, linear subspaces (lines, planes, etc), convex subsets, the list goes on. By contrast, concepts in the complex plane don't usually generalize in the same way (if you're using them for phasors, you probably won't need anything more general than the complex plane, but it's an overarching moral of analysis that calculus over complex numbers is shockingly more well-behaved than over Euclidean spaces; for an understandable example, look up ""Hartog's theorem"").  Your other question (which I think you had as a result of your confusion about my previous point, correct me if I'm wrong) about ""are real numbers also complex"" is just a matter of definitions. But yea, if pressed to answer I'd say yes, real numbers are exactly complex numbers without the ""complex component""; a better way to say this is without the imaginary part. Real numbers are also complex, in just the same way that the x axis is a subset of the (Cartesian, complex) plane."

The linear algebra class has prerequisite knowledge of linear algebra, so chances are you know about each of the topics covered to some degree and since most of these techniques are readily packaged for use in matlab or numpy, or some library in any programming language you plan to use, implementing these techniques is as simple as looking at documentation.

math,3d8z79,octatoan,5,Tue Jul 14 12:59:13 2015 UTC,"I have been working through this book seriously since about the beginning of the summer semester, for what it's worth I am going into my 3rd year at U of T.  Before I really started, I had finished an abstract algebra course that got up to Galois theory and I had worked through a significant portion of sections we hadn't covered in Dummit and Foote (Mainly modules, and chapters 15,16 and 17). I had also worked through a book on category theory (Tom Leinster's book) and spent time watching some videos on youtube by a guy named Harpreet Bedi. However, from time to time I still get stuck at points that are a little too much for me, and I have to reference the internet or learn from another source (I'm looking at you Spectral Sequences!).  My advice is to:   Complete an abstract algebra course that covers up to at the very minimum field theory... and preferably Galois theory. Jump right in and fill in the gaps as you go.   Anything you will need past abstract algebra (plus modules) is generally explained in Vakil's book, although often in a ""you should know this"" flavored way. Often times it will be very clear where your lacking knowledge is, and so you can put his book aside and fill in the gaps yourself.  It is not an easy book by any means, but best of luck!"

math,3d8z79,Pandaval9,2,Tue Jul 14 14:28:35 2015 UTC,"Early chapter 6 (just finished the basic introduction to Schemes).  The best piece of advice I can give you is to treat every statement as an exercise, and to try to find your own examples of things as they come up. For example, there is an exercise on the ""pushforward sheaf"", and you can complete it in a very formal way by checking axioms. Don't just stop there, try to find a simple example, and check for yourself that it works.  The other piece of advice I have is to become comfortable with things just being abstract. Having concrete examples is key to understanding, but part of the difficulty people seem to have with Schemes (in my limited experience just talking to other students) is that they want it to be more concrete than it is. The definition is EXTREMELY ABSTRACT, and you have to let your brain come to terms with that when you come to it. Your brain will be thinking that you are missing something, you aren't."

A few things to consider:   It is sometimes helpful to consider ideals to be subrings (for example, in the statement of the third isomorphism theorem), so there are good reasons to consider rings without identity, at least in an introductory course in algebra. Categorically, unital rings are more complicated. For example, the zero ring is not a zero object in the category of unital rings. For this reason, things like kernels do not have a nice categorical description unless we consider rings without identity. However, (commutative) unital rings arise naturally in algebraic geometry and number theory, and in this setting it is rare to consider rings without identity or non-unital homomorphisms. Non-unital rings often display pathological or unwanted behavior. For example, if R=2Z and I=(4), then I is a maximal ideal of R which is not prime."

For any function f(s) defined near s = 1 such that (s-1)f(s) --> 1 as s --> 1 you would get exactly the same limit formula involving log(x).   The two numerical identities you write down involving log 2 and log 3 are consequences of one of the standard ways of analytically continuing the zeta function from Re(s) > 1 to Re(s) > 0.

The reason why this comparison has the traction that it does is because you can express sin(x) and cos(x) in terms of eix, which essentially maps the real numbers to the complex unit circle, which can be thought of as 1x1 matrices with complex coefficients.  These 1x1 matrices happen to be all the unitary ones in C1, so they form the group U(1).  Representation theory is the study of mapping abstract groups into real or complex matrices, and then using linear algebra tools (you decompose the space into smaller subspaces to find irreducible representations, you take the determinants traces of the matrices to define the character of the representation, etc.).  So I guess there's ways of expressing sin and cos in terms of characters, but I don't use this stuff regularly enough to see how you'd derive trig formulas out of that (guess I'll start fiddling with this).

Engineers need to know that something works. In general, the tried and true is better than spending a lot of time making something new. Scientists, on the other hand, aren't that interested in making something out of existing technologies. They're interested in making something new and better with less regard for how long it takes. A good example is search. Making a better search algorithm could take years of research and involves a ton of math. For an engineer, the more important skill is being able to choose the right search algorithm out of existing algorithms. We need both. But CS is basically applied math. It's about computation.

Next time an opportunity for a calculation comes up, try it in your head first for a few seconds before reaching for the calculator. I actually also recommend doing it by hand even. Not recommended if you have like 20 things to calculate, but maybe if you only have one or two, or you are just reading something that happens to have a simple addition or multiplication problem in it or something.  To help with the multiplication tables, think about the ones you know. You probably know anything multiplied by 10 very easily. How about anything multiplied by 5? Think about the fact that 6x5 is just 3x10 (you're just moving a factor of 2 from the 6 side to the 5 side). Then 7x5 is wither just 3.5x10 or 6x5+1x5. Then you can start thinking about how 7x6 is just 7x5+7x1 and so on.

You should be able to figure out what 83/5 is in decimals without scribbling anything down. You should be able to approximate sqrt(58) after thinking about it for 3 seconds. When you are given a not-too-outrageous arithmetic problem, you should be able to critically think about it and use estimation and properties of arithmetic (especially distribution) to at least arrive at a good approximation fairly quickly.   Look at arithmetic as a logical challenge. When you have to split a tip, don't use a calculator or pencil. Have a good approximation for how much multiple purchases will cost before you get to the register. Figure out what a sale is without pulling out your phone. When you have to multiply as part of a larger proof, don't plug in 2x3 into the calculate. Do it on your own.  The attitude that you encounter in this thread and just in math intensive fields, the ""I'm great at proofs/integrals/topology/etc, but I plug in 2+3 into my calculator"" attitude, is the same attitude that you encounter from people who pride themselves at being bad at math, which is somehow more reprehensible. Both the arithmetically challenged mathematician and the proud owner of multiple F's in pre-algebra are actually talking about the same math. Yet somehow it's okay for the mathematician to be bad at it. It's like a basketball player who can only shoot, but not dribble.  TL;DR You don't have to be a human calculator, but if you can't figure out something not too crazy in your head, then your missing something. Arithmetic is a logical problem, not a memorization one.

Once I started learning physics and had a reason to care about math (and was actually solving interesting problems instead of just doing a poor imitation of a calculator)  I finally started to enjoy it and was suddenly doing great at it.  Mental arithmetic is a skill like any other- you'll get better with practice, but it's likely you'll find it's not really worth the effort.  This is really a great example of how terrible math education is at the early level- we teach kids a repetitive drill that was valuable to cashiers in the 50's and 60's instead of encouraging curiosity about numbers, logic, and systems."
math,3d4a8a,FunkMetalBass,4,Mon Jul 13 17:04:19 2015 UTC,"First, I wouldn't conflate ""arithmetic"" with ""math"". Arithmetic is the part of math you learn first, but its really pretty different from algebra, never mind calculus or analysis.  I had a friend in college who made a remark something like ""I'm a math major!  I can't do arithmetic!"" - which was partly tongue in cheek, but there's a kernel of truth to it - with the sort of math that he'd been working on, he really hadn't had much need for basic arithmetic in a couple of years.  On the other hand, I do think a working knowledge of arithmetic can be a valuable thing, whether you use it or not.  Playing with numbers helps build intuition for how the rest of math fits together, and there is value in being able to solve simple problems and estimate slightly larger ones without needing to pull out a calculator.  And ultimately, I think that's mostly a matter of memorization, and thus a matter of practice.  When it comes to doing multiplication, for instance, there's really no substitute for being able to look at something like 6 * 7 and just know that the answer is 42, without having to compute anything or wrack one's brain for the answer.  Its no accident that many schools assign innumerable worksheets over several years to practicing the times tables - because that sort of repetitive drilling is how you get the times tables down cold, and all multiplication you might want to do flows from there.  There's still plenty of things you can practice to get better from there, but you'd be amazed how much easier it is to solve a problem like 16*7 if you can convert it to 70+42 without needing to stop and think about the intermediate steps."

I finished a PhD in theoretical physics, masters in Applied Mathematics, and I work as a quantitative analyst (""quant"") for investment banks and insurance companies.  I'm terrible at arithmetic.  Seriously.  I couldn't tell you what 9*6 is without counting on my fingers ""9, 18, 27, 36, ..."".  I feel like I'm at a slight disadvantage compared to my colleagues, but mostly, it really doesn't matter.  The problem with most peoples' thinking is that most people think that arithmetic is math.  Or perhaps a type of math.  I view it differently.  I view the relationship between arithmetic and math similarly to scales and music.  Arithmetic is not any more ""math"" than a C Ionian scale or sight reading ability is ""music"".  They are tools which are sometimes useful, and sometimes not.  Dave Brubeck and Django Reinhardt couldn't read music.  I doubt Kurt Cobain could play a scale.  Didn't hurt them because sight reading and scales aren't music.  Simply the tools of music.  Similarly, any ""real"" mathematician would probably disagree with me that arithmetic is even a ""tool"" of math.  My view betrays my status as an applied mathematician.  In any physics or math program at university, arithmetic will be important for the first year, maybe two, because your problems will largely be calculational.   After that, it will be rare to see a number.  Oh, they'll pop up every now and then.  When you take abstract algebra or PDEs, there will always be the contrived ""applied problem"" but the main point of these problems is to get practice with the guts of what you're doing, and then seeing how it applies to a real world situation, which is always easier when you make a box around something that looks like ""10 meters"" instead of ""a +2*sinh(d)"".  As for your job, even if you have a math or physics job, numbers (edit: probably) won't really be your ""currency"".

My family is pretty musical, and from personal experience, the best of us play by ear.  I'm probably the most ""schooled"" out of my family (except for my mom who did an MA in music).  I'm probably the only one of us who would, say, have a good laugh if someone asked me to play a B Lydian scale.  My sight reading chops are great b/c I studied orchestral violin and classical guitar.  But I consider myself the worst musician in the family.  The best of us plays literally by ear, taking riffs and motifs from songs and passages.  Again, anecdotal, but that's my personal experience.  Anyway, none of that really matters.  The point being, arithmetic is pretty useless for anyone.  I'd even wager that arithmetic is far, far more important to, say, an cashier at a store without a fancy cash register than an accountant or an engineer.  I think to a professional, being familiar with numbers is more important than doing arithmetic operations on them.  For example, knowing that 71,123.14 * 109.39 is going to have 6 trailing zeros preceded by 7.   Or knowing that pi equals 3.   Or knowing (if you're a physicist) that a virus is about 20 orders of magnitude less heavy than a baseball.  Or (if you're a quant/statistician) being able to grasp things like the law of total probability or total variance.  Or understanding Benford's Law.  Stuff like that.

Similarly, teaching people algorithms for addition, subtraction, etc is helpful.

It's immensely useful to at least get good enough with mental arithmetic - particularly estimation - to know whether an answer that a calculator or computer spits out is reasonable, such that you can then assume it is correct.  I tutor high school and college kids all the time who reach for a calculator to do even the simplest of computations, but they don't know whether the answer the thing spits out is correct because they didn't invest in first doing a little mental estimation to see what it should be.  Anything you can do to help your ability to do ballpark or back-of-the-envelope calculations in your head will help you avoid this pitfall, for example: * calculating the tax & tip at a restaurant * keeping a running total of the groceries in your cart * scaling up a recipe for a dozen cookies to bake 18 (or something coprime to 12 if you want to make really bad cookies) * factoring numbers to see if they're prime (ok this is nerdy, but it's how I pass the time while driving: I factor the reading on my odometer and if I don't get it within one mile, I lose)     ...and so on and so forth.

It goes by the name ""geometric algebra"" in more mainstream mathematics, e.g., Emil Artin wrote a book with that title. See also the chapter discussing orthogonal groups in Jacobson's Basic Algebra I. It is not useless or pointless as others are suggesting. The essential ingredient is a nondegenerate quadratic form over a field. A sum of two or more squares is nondegenerate over any field not of characteristic 2."

I think you will find this is for two reasons in math and physics:  1) People didn't specialize as much back then so they could get more involved in basic (ie fundamental, not simple) research in more fields.  2) These people whose names are so common had a tendency to create/discover/conceptualize things that were pivotal in some way, meaning we felt the impetus to expand upon their work. If you're working in some very nuanced subfield of something that was pursuant to Gauss/Cauchy/Jacobi/Euler's work, it might make sense to keep the name relation for clarity or just colloquial use since it needs to be called something.  I don't know particularly much about Jacobi individually but this is how it is for JL Lagrange, Carl Gauss, Leonard Euler et al."

It's a spiritual successor to the Zeno tool (http://pubs.doc.ic.ac.uk/zenoTwo/zenoTwo.pdf) but is pretty dissimilar at this point.  The above checks whether terms in functional programming languages are equivalent. Since functional languages can represent mathematics (like Coq for example) you can use this to represent all kinds of theorems.  I was annoyed at the fact that equivalence between terms in functional programming languages actually holds quite rarely if you allow non-termination or have infinite data structures (like in Haskell). Even [;(x + 1) + y = x + (y + 1);] doesn't hold since [;x;] might be generated by a function which crashes at some point, so [;(x + 1) + y;] will crash one evaluation step later than [;x + (y + 1);].   I decided to build an 'approximation' prover instead. Approximation acts like a 'less-defined-or-equal-to' operator, so if [;A \sqsubseteq B;] then [;A;] might crash or fail to terminate more, but otherwise behaves like [;B;]. So for example we have [; x + (y + 1) \sqsubseteq (x + 1) + y;].   As for proving these properties: induction doesn't work for infinite objects or non-terminating functions, coinduction requires 'productive' proofs, and fixed-point induction doesn't work for a large set of examples. I figured out a new and easy to automate proof technique for these properties which doesn't have these disadvantages :)"

Once you have that, all you have to do is take the flow {Etψ}, project it onto the subspace of V containing your business, and then also project it onto the other subspaces which support the world's cash. Track the evolution of ψ on those subspaces and your business subspace, and bam! You'll have your math model of a business.

Multivariable calculus repeats this for multiple variables and assumes you understand how to complete single variable problems.

Gödel's incompleteness theorems let us know that we can't completely eliminate the possibility. Now, it would require vigorous and rigorous checking to ensure there's not a problem with the proof.  If this were to happen, the implications would be deep: it would prove that ZFC is inconsistent, as well as ZF, and in fact any system of axioms allowing us to prove that pi is irrational. Mathematics as we know it would essentially be overturned.   But we think this is unlikely, mainly because the aforementioned axioms generally fall into the category of ""so intuitive that they're OBVIOUSLY true.""

math,3d9bfa,whirligig231,9,Tue Jul 21 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"It would mean we're somehow very wrong about what rational numbers are. We know that pi is irrational, which means it doesn't start repeating itself (including terminating in 0s) when written as its decimal representation.  But we've proven repeatedly that it's irrational, so if it did do that, something is very wrong. That would imply we've made a math-breaking assumption at some very early point."
math,3d9bfa,galtonwatson,4,Tue Jul 14 14:48:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by infinite, but pi is not infinite. It's smaller than 4 but larger than 3. That's pretty finite under any reasonable definition. What is infinite is its decimal representation. This is not very unique; so is 1/3. But, pi would have an infinite representation in any base. This also is not very unique. So would sqrt(2) (or any irrational number). Pi is also transcendental.  So, are you asking for the ramifications if pi was not transcendental? Not irrational?"
math,3d9bfa,wgunther,3,Tue Jul 14 14:48:57 2015 UTC,"First, ""infinite number"" is a confusing choice of phrasing.  What you mean is that there are infinitely many digits after the decimal point.  Second, that's not an ""as far as we can tell"", it's a proven theorem.  It is a mathematical certainty that the digits go on forever.  Third, having infinitely many digits after the decimal point only scratches the surface: Pi is transcendental, which means that there's no polynomial equation (like x7+3x3-2=0) where Pi is a solution.  So it's a theorem that Pi ""can't be described"" using only the usual tools of high school algebra.  It's a little hard to consider what would it would be like if something utterly impossible were true---math would have to be very, very different for that to happen, but consider that if Pi had finitely many digits after the decimal point, however, it would be rational: Pi would be equal to some fraction p/q.  For example, this would completely change the nature of one of the classic greek problems (angle trisection, where you take an angle and, using a straight edge and a compass, divide it into three equal pieces): many angles (perhaps all of them) which cannot be trisected, could be trisected if Pi were rational."

Yes, there are proofs that pi is irrational, and there have been such proofs for a long time, and it's a completely settled question within mathematics.  But the proofs can be a little involved. The proofs have several steps, and consist of more than just a single ""aha"" moment.

math,3d54bv,mathsorcerer,3,Mon Jul 13 19:38:21 2015 UTC,"Tier 1 schools are extremely difficult to get into as one would imagine. A lot of the time there are 400 applicants and only 10-15 available spots. Not to mention you're competing with foreign students and students from top 10 schools (MIT, Harvard, Princeton, etc.) who actually completed their undergrad degree in mathematics and often times finish with near a 4.0 GPA, near perfect GREs, and have letters of recommendation from people that are notorious in their respective fields. Not to come off as if it is not feasible but it is not likely you will get admitted into a tier 1 PhD program for mathematics based off your profile. I would advise studying for the math subject GRE test and based off your score you can probably compile a list of graduate programs that are more feasible. However, it's always good to have a few reach schools when applying to these programs. Letters of recommendation are also extremely important and usually aren't emphasized enough, I'm not exactly sure the best way for you personally to go about it not knowing your circumstances fully but do your best to get good letters when doing the application process. Also, as far as research experience goes it is not required for mathematics, most colleges do not expect their incoming graduate students to have much research experience, especially considering that graduate math research is a different beast than most undergraduate research mainly because undergrads don't have the foundation to conduct research until they complete their program."

It's a good question! :)  Honestly, getting into a tier 2 program isn't too difficult. It's by no means an easy task but someone with a moderate background could still get into a tier 2 program with an assistantship, meaning that the university will pay for your courses and give you (typically) a monthly stipend for living expenses. It's not a lot of money, but enough to get by for sure. Also, example of moderate would be like 3.2 GPA, decent letters of rec., and maybe 50 percentile in subject GRE.  But going back to your question, a PhD in mathematics is absolutely worth it regardless of where you get it from. A PhD speaks wonders about you and it's the ceiling so to speak when it comes to education, meaning you can't go any higher. However, the same cannot be said for a masters degree in my opinion and unfortunately most graduate students end up settling for a masters degree after 2 years of their respective program. It's difficult and consumes your life and some people aren't up for that challenge. But if your in it for the long haul a PhD is totally worth it.   In regards to finding work, if you get a PhD from a not so known college then you'll still be able to find work. You have a freakin' PhD in mathematics after all! If you want to stay in academia it might be more difficult though. However, if you want to go into industry they usually don't care where you got your degree from but more so care about your overall capability to analyze data or whatever the job calls for. You'll be able to convey that you are more than capable though with the aid of your PhD and if the research you did is pertinent at all you can utilize that as a means for obtaining the job also.

In short- doing a Masters may look shameful, but I think it is not a bad thing at all.   Mathematics is ""use-it-or-lose-it""... and professors know that. Having 2 years outside of school is going to look poorly. Based on the selection of incoming students, they generally favor students that are coming out of undergrad- because they are more likely to remember ""the basics.""  Determine your career path Why do you want a PhD? Do you want to make a lot of money, do you want to become a professor? Or do you just dig math? This is an important question. Some of my colleagues in graduate school do not use their degrees. While they would most definitely say they enjoyed their experience, from a practical standpoint, they could have done without their PhDs. For example three of my colleagues say, in hindsight, they should have just done a masters, then gotten a tech/industry job.   Would I benefit from entering a master's program and working on letters/research experience? Or would the opportunity cost be a bit too high?   For the first question, if your goal is to get into a Top Tier research program, then the answer would be ""yes"".   As for your second question, that is up to you. Remember that money only goes so far in life- and generally speaking, an advanced degree in math/applied math should make you golden. Depending on your position now and the specifics of the school, the opportunity cost of a masters could be up to $400k.   Also, many mathematics departments offer Teaching Assistantships that provide a stipend and tuition coverage. While these are generally reserved for PhD students, at Masters institutions, they are given to Master's students.  Without knowing any specifics, I would follow /u/DeathAndReturnOfBMG 's advice and call programs you may be interested in- they should be honest with you.   However, from my experience, your resume along with the fact you've been ""out of math"" for 2 years makes acceptance into a top tier applied math PhD program not as likely.  Good luck!"
math,3d0xia,aclay81,107,Sun Jul 12 16:30:39 2015 UTC,"Gottlob Frege was a pioneer in fundamental logic and set theory, and he tried to lay a foundation for all of mathematics in his book Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, or Basic Laws of Arithmetic. However, he made one fatal flaw: he allowed unrestricted comprehension, the axiom (schema) stating that for all logical statements with a variable S(x), the set {x : S(x) is true} could be constructed. That is to say, given any proposition, the set of all mathematical objects satisfying that proposition could be said to exist. However, Bertrand Russell discovered a paradox in this reasoning: if this is true, we can construct a ""set of all sets that do not contain themselves,"" or {x : x is not an element of x}. Call this set A. If A contains A, then A satisfies ""x is not an element of x""; A is not an element of A. This is a contradiction. But if A is not an element of A, A must be one of the sets contained in A; this is also a contradiction, so no such set A can exist, contradicting the axiom.  Russell sent Frege a letter on this matter, which unfortunately arrived too late, just as the book was to go to press. Frege only had time to append a short note, beginning with what is sometimes called the greatest understatement in all of mathematics: ""A scientist can hardly encounter anything more undesirable than to have the foundation collapse just as the work is finished. I was put in this position by a letter from Bertrand Russell . . .""  Two ways to solve this paradox have been proposed. One way, used in Quine's New Foundations theory, is to have a sort of ""layered"" set theory and disallow movement across ""layers""; so ""x is not an element of x"" is not allowed as a formula for a set, because the two x's would be on different ""layers."" The other way, used in ZFC, which is the most common set theory these days, is to disallow unrestricted comprehension and only allow restricted comprehension: we cannot form a set from any collection of elements, only from those elements in another set. So we cannot construct the set of all sets that do not contain themselves, but we can construct the set of all sets within some larger set that do not contain themselves. (This set will be empty in ZFC, but some other theories allow self-containing sets; Peter Aczel is an example of a contemporary mathematician who works with them.) This means we need some other way to build larger sets, and this is provided by the axioms of power set and infinity.  Russell himself wrote the book Principia Mathematica as a second attempt at a formalized foundation of mathematics; I don't know off the top of my head which of the two above resolutions he used."

math,3d0xia,viking_,7,Sun Jul 12 17:38:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think you really have to view those resolutions as mutually exclusive, though. If you have different ""layers"" of comprehension, and then you choose a particular layer, then within that layer you get restricted comprehension: you can't form arbitrary collections of things in that layer (because you might get something that only exists in a higher layer) but you can form arbitrary subcollection of things already known to be in that layer. This is essentially the idea of Grothendieck's resolution."

math,3d0xia,JustFinishedBSG,3,Mon Jul 13 10:00:49 2015 UTC,"You can still quantify over all sets; you can make statements of the form ""for all sets x, x does not contain x."" You just aren't allowed to make these into a set, which is a very particular mathematical object within the domain of discourse. And as far as truths are concerned, you can still prove or disprove a bunch of truths and absurdities; you just can't put these into a set. Putting things into a set doesn't mean ""talking about them as a collection of something""; you can do that without needing a set of them. Putting things into a set allows us to use the axioms of set theory on something. The main benefit of this is a bit tricky to notice: in set theory, as in any first-order theory, we are allowed to quantify over sets, but not over collections of sets. That is, we can say things like ""for all sets,"" but not ""for all mappings"" or ""for all collections."" However, if these mappings and collections are sets, then we can quantify over them again."

math,3d0xia,kraken_calamari,3,Mon Jul 13 02:15:46 2015 UTC,depends how we're defining a hole.  in this case a hole needn't go all the way through.  a sphere composed of just the 2d surface has one while a solid ball would have none. source i may have the deets wrong I am far from knowledgeable in topology.
math,3d0xia,mullerjones,-1,Mon Jul 13 03:08:13 2015 UTC,"It doesn't. Having the same number of holes as a sphere means having no holes as that number is 0.  If your original question was about how you determine how many holes a surface has, then the answer is by using closed loops on its surface. Imagine a closed loop in the surface of a sphere. You can shrink that loop to a single point, no matter what loop you start with, which means it has no holes. Now, if you think of a donut, you'll see that isn't the case. You can probably imagine some closed loop on its surface which could be shrunk to a point, but you also have a bunch of possible loops that can't ever do it, which means there is a hole. That's how you check mathematically for holes.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong but that's basically it."

In the case you're talking about, you'd do the same thing I said using 1 dimensional closed loops but with 2 dimensional closed surfaces, right? Or something else entirely?"
math,3d0xia,MrHilbertsPlayhouse,2,Mon Jul 13 13:55:21 2015 UTC,"Sort of! There are actually two ways of thinking about it, that I know of. One is, like you said, to replace closed loops with closed surfaces. More precisely, you can think about different maps from the surface of a sphere to the topological space you're studying, and look at which maps deform into each other. This gives you the higher homotopy groups. These higher homotopy groups are famously difficult to compute/understand, so my understanding is that not many people use them.   The other way, which ends up being a lot easier to understand, is using what's called homology. To find homology groups, you again start by finding all the ways you can put a sphere (i.e. the surface of a ball) inside your space. But now, instead of wondering which spheres ""deform"" (i.e. homotope) into each other, you count which of these spheres can be ""filled in"" by a ball. So for instance, if I have a solid cube, then any sphere inside the cube will surround a ball also inside the cube. So a solid cube will have homology group 0 (technically, we say its ""second homology group"" is zero, since we're talking about two-dimensional spheres---you can do exactly the same thing with spheres of higher or lower dimension). But now, let's take a solid cube with a point removed. Then any sphere containing this point inside of it can't be filled in by a ball. So the homology group of this cube with  a point missing is nonzero. Note that this is different from what you were talking about---we can still shrink any loop in this space to a point!   A good intro to this stuff, if you know some topology, is the second chapter of Hatcher's book (http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATch2.pdf). The whole book is online (legally!) if you want to go through it though."

Since you seem to have difficulty grasping the basic principle at work here, I'll explain. After the host reveals a goat, you now have a one-in-two chance of being correct. Whether you change your selection or not, the odds are the same. There is enough mathematical illiteracy in this country, and we don't need the world's highest IQ propagating more. Shame!"" – Scott Smith, Ph.D. University of Florida  From the rest of the section:  Vos Savant wrote in her first column on the Monty Hall problem that the player should switch (vos Savant 1990a). She received thousands of letters from her readers—the vast majority of which, including many from readers with PhDs, disagreed with her answer. During 1990–1991 three more of her columns in Parade were devoted to the paradox (vos Savant 1990–1991), and the discussion was replayed in other venues (e.g., in Cecil Adams' ""The Straight Dope"" newspaper column, (Adams 1990)), and reported in major newspapers such as the New York Times (Tierney 1991).  In an attempt to clarify her answer she proposed a shell game (Gardner 1982) to illustrate: ""You look away, and I put a pea under one of three shells. Then I ask you to put your finger on a shell. The odds that your choice contains a pea are 1/3, agreed? Then I simply lift up an empty shell from the remaining other two. As I can (and will) do this regardless of what you've chosen, we've learned nothing to allow us to revise the odds on the shell under your finger."" She also proposed a similar simulation with three playing cards.  Vos Savant commented that though some confusion was caused by some readers not realizing that they were supposed to assume that the host must always reveal a goat, almost all of her numerous correspondents had correctly understood the problem assumptions, and were still initially convinced that vos Savant's answer (""switch"") was wrong."

Proof: x is odd, so there exists an integer k s.t. x=2k+1. x2 then equals (2k+1)2  = 4k2 + 4k + 1 = 2 (2k2 + 2k) + 1 which is of the form 2j + 1, so it is odd.  If x is even, then x2 = (2k)2 = 4(k2 ) = 2(2k2 ) = 0 (mod 2) for some integer k. Bear in mind that x = 0 (mod 2) since x is even.  The relation x2 sends 0 to 0, and 1 to 1.

Since the denominator is symmetric with respect to i=k and i=(y-k) for any k, you might be able to pair up terms by like denominators and figure something useful out about the numerator for each pair (maybe they reduce to 0 except in a small number of cases if you're lucky?  I'm not sure).  Then all you would have to do is make sure that you handled both even y (all terms are paired) and odd y (the middle term has no pairing).

The quickest proof I can think of for the finite dimensional case is by showing injectivity of the map (injectivity is easily shown), then use this to show that a basis of the space gets mapped to another basis of the space.  For a counterexample in the infinite dimensional case, consider a vector space [; V ;] with basis [; \left{v1,v_2,\ldots\right} ;] and define [; L ;] via the extension of the mapping [; v_i\mapsto v{i+1} ;] Then [; L ;] has trivial kernel but is not surjective as no vector maps to [; v_1 ;]."

Now let A be the Hermitian matrix, and let W be the vector space orthogonal to V (for the complex Hermitian inner product). Since A is Hermitian and V is an eigenvector it takes W to itself. In fact A:W-->W is now a Hermitian linear transformation of the complex linear space W. Now note that the complex dimension of W is one less than the original vector space.  So we have reduced the situation to a smaller dimension. From this you can adapt a proof by induction.  Note that this proof fails in infinite dimensions, because there is no characteristic polynomial. One needs to also require that your Hermitian linear operator is a compact operator."

math,3d3h87,Thorinandco,7,Mon Jul 13 05:40:05 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I'm a professional math tutor. Here are my initial thoughts.    WHAT MAKES A GOOD STUDY FRAMEWORK? It will help to have a rough game plan before you start. Since the student is not currently enrolled in a math class, a little more planning is required than usual.    You don't need to spend tons and tons of time developing the  initial game plan. The particulars will change as you progress through the tutoring. Your framework should be flexible enough to allow you to individualize the instruction significantly.  Your framework should give you some direction. This way, while you're tutoring, you don't spend so much time on deciding what to do next, or on lengthy digressions, that the student does not meet his goals; also, you'll have resources in mind that you can use to assign outside practice problems (you can use these to make specific assignments at the end of each tutoring session, based on the needs that arise during the session).    EXAMPLE OF A STUDY FRAMEWORK Before you get started, try to get a sense of the student's background and goals.    If the parent and student are willing to share his Algebra 2 grades, that's a start. Of course, grades can be misleading and provide only a very rough sense of the student's current skills. However, let's say the student earned a D in Algebra 2.  Then you might expect to spend most of your time reviewing, so you'll want to have some review resources to point to for outside practice (more on that later). Next, you'll want to determine the long-term goal of the tutoring. Let's say the student typically earns C grades in math and is looking to improve when he gets to precalculus. In that case, you want to make sure he understands the Algebra 2 topics that are essential for the precalculus curriculum. Then, if time permits, you can focus on some of the beginning precalculus concepts. At the end of the tutoring, if his prerequisite knowledge is solid, and he understands the concepts to be covered in the first several precalculus lessons, then he'll get off to a good start. That would be a good outcome.  You'll then want to take the information you've gathered and turn it into a measurable goal. Here's one way to do this. Find two Algebra 2 final exams that cover similar material, and at least one exam covering beginning precalculus (use your Google skills, or even ask the teacher, if you know him or her). Ask your student to indicate the grade he'd be happy with on these practice exams. If he typically earns C grades, he might be happy with a B+. Your long-term goal can then be for him to earn a B+ on these practice exams without any help and under test-taking conditions. It's probably a good idea to aim for an A, but if time is running out and he's not there yet, you have this minimum goal to focus your efforts. The parents might want to weigh in on the goals, and it's a good idea to include them as much as possible. [Note: if you have time, quickly glance through the precalculus curriculum. If any of the topics on your Algebra 2 final exams will not be needed in precalculus, such as topics in statistics and probability, then you can advise him to skip those problems, since time is limited.] Next, quickly look up some resources that you'll be able to use for outside assignments. You might just quickly familiarize yourself with the exercises available on Khan Academy, for example. Or, you might check out a precalculus textbook from your local library or get one from your high school.  Then, ask your student to take the first Algebra 2 exam before you begin the tutoring, with no notes or outside help. Assure him that you're not giving him a grade, and even if he can't solve a single problem (or if he solves all of them), then that's okay. You just don't want to spend time on topics that he already understands. (Note: this is much better than simply asking which topics he struggles with; when a student is in the middle of learning a subject, it's hard for him or her to identify the important topics to work on. In general, you need to have your student demonstrate his understanding; it's easy for a student to incorrectly think he understands a concept.) Now you're ready to get started. You can set short-term goals (per session, per week, ...) to support your long-term goal.  When you meet, you can start working through the problems that gave him trouble. At the end of the session, you can make an assignment using the resources you found, to help him practice similar problems. Your goal for the next session could be to make sure he can do the assigned problems, and to start a new group of problems. Just keep in mind that you might not reach all your short-term goals. In a classroom with 30 students, the teacher is compelled to advance at a predetermined pace, but as a tutor, you are not. There is no sense in moving forward if your student cannot keep up. Then why should you set short-term goals at all? It just helps to have an idea of what you'll cover. If you have more material planned than you can cover in one session, that means you won't run out of productive ways to use your time (for me, there always seems to be something to work on, so running out of material has never been an issue).   CONCLUSION This might all sound like a lot of work, but it really doesn't need to take long. A little prep work up front can make a big difference, and having a flexible outline can actually help you individualize instruction. The parent and student will both appreciate your professionalism, and you'll be able to help your student make bigger improvements.   Hope that helps!

Couples don't pick random days to get married; if my facebook news feed is to be trusted, then most weddings happen on summer weekends, and June seems to be the most popular month.

This definition provokes a natural protest: why would any sensible person need such pairs of operations?.... We get a totally different situation if we start off not with the group but with the concept of a transformation (a one-to-one mapping of a set onto itself) as it was historically. A collection of transformations of a set is called a group if along with any two transformations it contains the result of their consecutive application and an inverse transformation along with every transformation.

When he says about manifolds, groups, and determinants, I'm just reading it like, ""What kind of teacher doesn't open with that?"". A manifold is something that is locally Euclidean; groups naturally arise as sets of transformations; determinants tell you about areas/volumes. All of these are excellent starting points for students, with the abstract stuff coming later.  Anecdote time: knowing the attitude of some French academics first hand, this attitude was probably borne out of steadily rising frustration due to very strong arrogance and condescension. This ended up longer than I expected, but I have a little experience with this...  He mentions ""Prof M. Berry"" in this text whom I'm inferring from the author, context, and the Berry principles to be Profession Sir Michael Berry of the University of Bristol. This guy is my ""academic grandfather"" - PhD supervisor of my PhD supervisor. My supervisor worked with Berry a lot and has similar scathing things to say about mathematics in France (supervisor, not Berry). Some of the French academics that work on the pure side of our field very openly (and to my supervisor's face) call our work 'The trash can of Berry' because it is not very pure nor theorem driven (although neither was Berry's...), instead exploring the problem from the 'applied' point of view. This 'applied' approach, however, led to the fully rigorous theoretic proof of the problem in question using homology, which was co-authored by my supervisor. Who would have guessed that before the full rigorous proof comes some exploration and examples!  For clarification, the 'applied' side dealt with, ""Exponential asymptotic contributions of isolated critical points to multidimensional oscillatory complex integrals."", while the pure side dealt with (forgive me if I don't get this completely right, algebraic topologists/geometers) the ""Gauss-Manin connection where the critical locus is isolated"".  My thesis extended this problem to consider the Gauss-Manin connection where the critical locus is non-isolated, apparently a difficult open problem in pure maths. From my point of view, I was extending asymptotic theory to consider integrals whose phase function had non-isolated critical points (critical connected components). It took a similar 'applied' approach, but produced very concrete results, including as a side effect the successful computation of many multidimensional residues. It was not rigorously justified because the pure side is currently missing a key result to do with decomposing the homology group of the chain of integration in the presence of non-isolated critical points. This result would then allow me to decompose the integral for analysis in the required way. Making the (safe, according to MANY successful examples and some academics on the pure side) assumption that this result was true but yet to be proven, we proceeded and churned out a slew of new results, demonstrated via a plethora of examples. They are yet to be written up for a journal, but when they get published, I imagine some fresh criticism will come our way from the same crowd.  I had to keep it fairly vague because I don't want to throw anyone under the bus, but my little anecdote seems to reinforce the somewhat ""ridiculous total abstraction of mathematics"" notion that Arnold is going for. I think if his tone was less inflammatory it would be better received, because there is definitely some truth in there.  Edit: Put some more general stuff at the top."

The flaw with the inductive proof that all horses are the same color lies in the fact that your argument for P(k) implies P(k+1) does not work for k=1.  Typically proofs for things which are not true (where the proof has some inherent flaw) are usually taught to help you further question things (namely, why is this proof invalid) to give you a deeper intuition about how the Math behind these proofs work so you don't incorrectly prove something in a similar way in the future.

So if we expect a repeated multiplication, we would see something like ""the power of x to n added copies of the multiplicative identity is n multiplied copies of x."" This works, but we lose a bunch of nice properties in the process.   But the reason we lose those properties is that we stripped some of the nice symmetry out of the definition! We changed addition to multiplication and multiplication to exponentiation in one place each, not in all of the places they appear.

Rotation is an isometry, so the length doesn't change. Multiplication corresponds with the area of rectangles, so similarly, a rectangle with area ab can be rotated 90° to get a rectangle with the same area, area ba. In order to represent exponentiation, we consider hypervolumes of hypercubes where a is the side length, b is the dimension and ab is the hypervolume.

math,3cyeqd,Banach-Tarski,2,Sun Jul 12 00:27:51 2015 UTC,"This can be explained in a structural way if you take a look at what exponentiation really is. This means that we have to go away from the 'trivial case', which is the real numbers, and look at something more general. These general spaces are Lie groups, which are groups that have a compatible manifold structure (all maps defining the group structure are smooth). For such Lie groups, the tangent space at the identity is the Lie algebra, and one has a very nice map from the Lie algebra to the Lie group - the exponential map. For sub-Lie groups of the general linear group (a Lie group) this is the typical matrix exponential map, of which exponentiation in the real numbers is the 1-dimensional example.  So what you really have is that because the R1 can be canonically identified with its tangent space at the identity, the equation ax = xa even makes sense. For general Lie groups, that equation makes no sense, because the tangent space is a vector space and the lie group is a manifold, quite possibly the exact opposite of something with a linear structure on it. This means that you cannot identify the Lie groups and its Lie algebra, hence ""xa"" is entirely undefined, if x is an element in the Lie algebra and a is an element in the Lie group."

To preserve the type, you have to choose one of the arguments to have units, and force the other one to be a unit-less scalar, which starts to make it apparent that with a 'repeated operation' there is already an asymmetry.  There are cases where this already makes xy distinct from yx... In geometric algebra multiplying a distance x by a distance y in a different direction gives you a signed area that sweeps from x toward y, and y*x gives you an object going the opposite direction (something that has 'yx' units instead of 'xy' units.  Once you hit exponentiation you have a case where the units of the exponent can't even meaningfully combine with the units of the base, and the magnitude of the exponent is literally describing the type of object you get back out.  23 != 32 for the more general reason that if the base is in meters then one is an area and one is a volume."
math,3cyeqd,MauledByPorcupines,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:40:56 2015 UTC,"One reason is that, taken as a monoid, the naturals under addition have rank 1, whereas the naturals under multiplication (minus 0) have countably infinite rank.  That's basically what ruins everything.  As a result, there is no magic element that generates all the naturals under repeated multiplication. Rather, you have an infinite set of generators (the primes).  From this it's pretty easy to show that, given any two primes, they can't generate powers of one another - which is another way of saying the rank is countably infinite. So 2 can't generate 9, and 3 can't generate 8, and as a result exponentiation isn't commutative. Sorry about that."

I guess then where I'm from, Calculus 1 is differential calculus of a function of one variable, and Calculus 2 is single variable integral calculus.   Precalculus teaches the tools you need to do calculus. Does that help?"
math,3d0iga,RugerHD,2,Sun Jul 12 15:03:19 2015 UTC,"If this helps at all, this is my course description for Calculus 1:   Limits and continuity; the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus; definition of the derivative of a function and techniques of differentiation; applications of the derivative to maximizing or minimizing a function; the chain rule; mean value theorem, and rate of change problems; curve sketching; definite and indefinite integration of of algebraic, trigonometric and transcendental functions, with an application to the calculation of areas.   Calculus 2:   Differentiation and integration of exponential and logarithmic functions, techniques of integration, applications of the definite integral, the calculus of transcendental functions, parametric equations, polar coordinates, indeterminate forms and L’Hopital’s Rule, improper integrals, sequences and series.   With those stated, I would say that properties of graphs (hyperbolas, parabolas, circles, etc.) are going to be the most crucial and most applicable to both courses. As well as properties of logarithmic and exponential functions.   In cal 1 I did a lot of integration, derivatives, anti-derivatives, continuity, finding extrema of a function, etc. Basically the course description... KNOW YOUR GRAPHS. The better you are at being able to see a function and even just roughly placing it on a graph in your head, the easier the problems will be (somewhat). It helps give you a visual picture, but also gives you an idea of what kind of answer your looking for right off the bat. Along with that is trigonometry. You will not escape it, and knowing trig is crucial to your success. Identities, periods of each function, even or odd, all of it. Trig is a major part of each course and the more you understand it, the better prepared you will be for calculus.   So instead of rambling I'll do this. Below is what pre-calculus concepts were most applicable to each course:  Calculus 1   The idea of limits   Calculus 2   Polar coordinates/equations Complex plane DeMoivre's theorem Vectors and dot products Sequences    Both    Trigonometry (Unit circle, identities, etc.) Properties of graphs  Properties of logarithmic and exponential functions    Attached is a picture of my pre-cal syllabus.

In this context, +∞ and −∞ are describing quantitatively different behavior. Very large positive numbers are quite different and far away from very large negative numbers.   My question is why does mathematics require a negative infinity?   There is no requirement for negative infinity. The extended real number line has both +∞ and −∞, but the projectively extended real line has only one ""point at infinity."" However, the projectively extended real line does not have a meaningful concept of order like the extended real number line does."
math,3d0dms,zifyoip,11,Sun Jul 12 13:19:09 2015 UTC,"The ""infinity isn't a number"" explanation that gets thrown around is so oversimplified as to be misleading.  There are multiple approaches to handling infinity in mathematics, which are suitable for different situations.  When people say ""infinity isn't a number"", it's really a short hand for ""there's no single way to handle infinity that does all the things we want infinity to do"".  Which means any discussion of infinity has to include telling you what version you're using, and maybe why.  (Unfortunately, because the decision is usually dictated by what kind of math you're doing, people usually just assume you know.)  One version of infinity, the one wolfram is using, is called the ""two-point compactification"", because it adds two new object to the real numbers---positive infinity and negative infinity.  This is a natural thing to do because there are two ""infinite directions"" in the reals: unboundedly positive and unboundedly negative.  So in the two-point compactification , the limit as x approaches 0 of 1/x is different from the right and left---from the left, 1/x is a large negative number, so approaches negative infinity, while from the right, 1/x is a large positive number, so approaches positive infinity.  If you look at a graph of 1/x, it certainly doesn't look like the two sides are going to meet at 0; the two-point compactification is a good framework for making this precise, and more generally, for talking about the behavior of real valued functions."
math,3d0dms,elseifian,3,Sun Jul 12 13:28:18 2015 UTC,"In higher levels of math you begin looking at stuff as things become infinitely large or infinitely small. For example, what if we wanted to investigate what happens to the arctangent of x as x becomes smaller and smaller? We denote this as saying that x approaches -∞. If you look at the arctangent of x (or as you may know it ""tan-1 x"" which is a notation I absolutely hate but it's on calculators) function you see that when x decreases it gets closer and closer to -π/2. However, if you take any numerical value n you can say that arctan(n) ≠ -π/2 . Thus, even though we can see that this function tends towards -π/2 as x decreases, it only makes sense to talk about this in terms of how it acts towards infinity."
math,3d0dms,Nowhere_Man_Forever,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:03:42 2015 UTC,"or as you may know it ""tan-1 x"" which is a notation I absolutely hate but it's on calculators   Agreed. I use atan for arctangent.   you see that when x decreases it gets closer and closer to -π/2   This confused me until I realized that you were making x larger and larger (exponent wise, not sign wise) and not smaller and smaller. Here you get very different finite answers at ∞ and -∞. But couldn't you argue that ∞ can't be the input for a function that takes real numbers, and that the function ensures that the sign is preserved such that atan(-x) = -(atan(x))?"
math,3d0dms,Nowhere_Man_Forever,2,Sun Jul 12 20:02:22 2015 UTC,"But couldn't you argue that ∞ can't be the input for a function that takes real numbers, and that the function ensures that the sign is preserved such that atan(-x) = -(atan(x))?   I never said that you were using infinity as an input, just saying that you are describing behavior as a variable approaches negative infinity. As for the second part of you said, it's only true for even functions. Take the exponential function, ex . Nobody can argue that as x increases that it only gets larger and approaches infinity. However, as x decreases, the value of ex gets closer and closer to 0. You can prove that you can't find a value of x such that ex = 0 easily using calculus, but I suspect you haven't gotten there yet. However, when you observe values of ex as x gets smaller and smaller (approaches negative infinity), you see that it gets closer and closer to 0. We call this behavior a limit, and you'll learn about them in calculus.   I believe you have been misled by this business about ""infinity is not a number, but rather it is all numbers"" business. Infinity is indeed not a number in the number systems you are likely to encounter in your daily life (but it is in others), but it also isn't just ""all numbers."" Infinity is a sort of abstract concept that I don't really know how to properly explain in a succinct manner, so I won't attempt it here.

Limits sort of make sense, although I have not formally been taught them (I watch a lot of Numberphile). Of course in the ex example you can't just sub the sign.   I've also heard that some branches of math distinguish between +0 and -0. Where does that come up, and why doesn't Algebra distinguish?"
math,3d0dms,Hairy_Hareng,2,Sun Jul 12 20:31:58 2015 UTC,"I haven't really delved into that stuff because I am an engineering student, but in many cases it is useful to distinguish between what direction something approached 0 from so perhaps in some exotic number systems this is ""built in"" as it were. An example of a case where it can be handy to distinguish between what direction something approached 0 from is 1/x. For positive values of x, 1/x approaches infinity as x approaches 0. However, for negative values of x, 1/x approaches negative infinity as x approaches 0. Note that since 1/x does not approach a single value as x approaches 0, the limit of 1/x as x approaches 0 is undefined."
math,3d0dms,KillingVectr,2,Sun Jul 12 20:47:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's useful to think of math needing something. We humans use math to describe concepts that are useful for some reason or another  In the case of the infinities, one concept we need for functions and sequences is a descriptor for sequences and functions that never stop increasing and that get bigger than any given real after some time. Instead of that long winded explanation, we say that they tend to positive infinity. Similarly, we need a descriptor for things that go down to bigger and bigger negative values. We just say that these go to negative infinity.  These are both figures of speech but are useful because we can manipulate them easily and think about them easily"

math,3d0jtq,zifyoip,5,Sun Jul 12 14:40:29 2015 UTC,"The integers form an ordered ring, and the set S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} has the property that for all a, b, c ∈ Z, if a ∈ S, c ∈ S, and a ≤ b ≤ c, then b ∈ S. The set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is an interval in the ordered ring of integers. Is that what you mean?  More generally you can refer to an interval in a partially ordered set."
math,3d0jtq,zifyoip,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:42:55 2015 UTC,Well one of the definitions of continuity I read is that there are no jumps between numbers. It seems like what is defined as a jump should depend on some sort of background field/ring. Even the formal definition of continuity is defined rather abstractly in terms of functions so it seems like some additional context is needed to determine if a specific set is continuous.
math,3d0jtq,floer_homology,16,Sun Jul 12 15:01:25 2015 UTC,"one of the definitions of continuity I read is that there are no jumps between numbers   That is not a definition. It is far, far too imprecise to be of any use as a definition. At best that is an attempt at an informal description of a concept.   Even the formal definition of continuity is defined rather abstractly in terms of functions so it seems like some additional context is needed to determine if a specific set is continuous.   ""Continuous"" is an adjective that is normally applied to functions, not sets. Under the usual definitions of continuity, it doesn't make sense to say that a set is or is not continuous. Are you thinking of connectedness? Or perhaps your idea is that of continuous functions between topological spaces?"
math,3d0jtq,W_T_Jones,3,Sun Jul 12 15:09:18 2015 UTC,I guess the problem is I don't understand how something like f(x + a) - f(x) relates to my informal understanding of what continuity is.
math,3d0jtq,Diggodoggo,12,Sun Jul 12 15:35:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think the problem is that you have a poor informal understanding of continuity.  The first thing you need to understand is the concept of continuity at a point. A function f : R → R is continuous at a point x if and only if for every allowable positive output-tolerance ε > 0 there is a positive input-tolerance δ > 0 such that whenever y is within the input-tolerance of x, that is, |y − x| < δ, the value of f(y) is within the output-tolerance of f(x), that is, |f(y) − f(x)| < ε.  So, if you say that you want a nontrivial interval around x within which the output of the function f varies by no more than 0.0001 from f(x), I can find a positive value of δ such that the output of the function f is always within 0.0001 of f(x) whenever the input to the function is taken from the interval (x − δ, x + δ). And this is true no matter what positive tolerance you give me; you chose ε = 0.0001 here, but you could have chosen ε = 0.000001 or ε = 0.00000001 or whatever, and no matter what positive value of ε you choose I can always give you an interval (x − δ, x + δ) within which the value of f is less than ε away from f(x).  Once you understand continuity at a point, then you can say that a function is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every point in that interval. And a function is continuous (with no qualifiers) if it is continuous at every point in its domain."
math,3d0jtq,wintermute93,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:45:56 2015 UTC,So since Z is a subset of R it could also be Z -> Z right. I think I understand better why I have such a hard time understanding the formal definition of continuity. Its because there are too many variables and functions to keep track of.
math,3d0jtq,WhackAMoleE,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:59:51 2015 UTC,"What you are saying is correct for functions f : R -> R. However, continuity is a topological property and Z is a topological space, so it is also possible to talk about continuity of functions Z -> T, where T is any topological space.   The most common topologies on Z are the discrete topology, relative to which every function is continuous, and the Zariski topology. I'm less familiar with the Zariski topology on Z, so I don't know immediately what sort of functions are continuous here.   I don't think that continuous functions relative to either of these topologies are interesting, however it does address the OP's notion that the structure underlying the domain of a function should influence what it means for that function to be continuous."

I had to teach myself enough linear algebra to make things go, and then everywhere I turned there was another use for another area of mathematics I knew nothing about at the time. It left me with a weird hodge-podge bag of tricks.  But I think the moment when the role of mathematics crystalized for me was that along the way I read a bunch of papers by the recently-late Seth Teller on Plücker coordinates for visible surface determination, and my world changed.  He was matter-of-factly talking about the dimensionality of lines in a 3d space.  If you think about it there's ""around"" 5 dimensions of information there in a line. You could pick a point on the line and talk about a yaw and a pitch or something, but this is a deeply unsatisfying and arbitrary way to work with a line.  So he used these Plücker coordinates to talk about them. Where he'd just stack up two homogeneous coordinates for different points into a 2x4 matrix, and look at the 2x2 minor determinants of that matrix.  By picking two columns you got different 2x2 matrices. Picking the same column each time got a degenerate matrix, if you flip the order you picked the columns it would negate the result. So now we have a 4x4 matrix of determinants of the minor matrices, all the diagonal entries are 0 and it is antisymmetric. So out of 16 coefficients, only 6 are left. Finally if we multiply one of our homogeneous coordinates by a non-zero scalar multiple it shouldn't change the result, so we have a projective space, these coordinates are themselves homogeneous.  So now we're representing lines in 3 dimensional space by points and hyperplanes in a 5 dimensional projective space, but not just any points and hyperplanes -- those minor determinants are not independent -- but rather points and hyperplanes that intersect a quadric in a 5 dimensional projective space!  Then from there we could proceed to see how to use those things to solve a very concrete problem, figuring out what polygons were visible from a given point in space in a KD-Tree (or BSP tree) in computer graphics.  My mind was blown.  In the process of learning how that worked and how to use it, I had to learn more projective geometry, learn real analysis to figure out how to reduce the problem size down to something with a combinatorially simple solution, learn about positive- and negative- definite matrices and hyperbolic spaces, quadratic spaces, isotropic vectors...  I plugged it into a game engine and it just worked.  After that I was converted.  To me now, all of this stuff is obvious -- after all everything a mathematician has done before is ""obvious"" and anything that they know someone else has done is ""easy"" and everything else is ""hard"" -- but at the time this stuff blew my mind.  When I had a chance to go back for a math degree a bit later in my career after the dot-com crash, I took it."

I fell in love with math when I realized the vastness and diversity of ideas and concepts as well as the rigorous detail you can describe them.

math,3cwclz,mmcminimee,2,Sun Jul 12 00:26:29 2015 UTC,"A research project I worked on in high school.      I was in Pre-calc junior year & was bored out of my mind. At one point we were studying polynomial equations (which I found really interesting), but it was boring to hear the same concepts explained over-and-over again when I understood it in 15 minutes. Everyone else needed a week or two to get it. To pass the time I contemplated imaginary numbers. A lot of people found them really annoying but I found them really cool. I loved how you could extend the real numbers to solve any algebraic equation, but I didn't like that you couldn't graph them in a normal way. You couldn't locate the complex roots of a function just by examining x-intercepts. I later learned after doing some Google research that you could graph functions of a complex variable using colors & hues. But that didn't make sense to me either (at the time). So I set out to create a new method of graphing functions of a complex variable, such that the complex roots could be easily identified.      It took me about 6 months & lots of scrapped ideas before I found a method I was satisfied with. It involved graphing ordered pairs (x,y) as vectors in the complex plane. As a result, the graph of a complex function is basically a vector field. In this case the roots of a function are the vectors that head toward the origin. I went on to study the various properties of well-known functions & see if any new insights arose using my new graphing method. To this day it's still a work-in-progress. Ironically I came up with this method while bored in physics class.      The project continued into my senior year, where I entered my research paper into 2 national competitions. I didn't get any special recognition for it, but I didn't care. The project itself was my first true exposure to pure math research. And I loved every minute of it. I also loved how working on this project cost me no money. I was originally going to major in engineering in college, and wanted to work on some small projects in high school. But for engineering, that required a lot of things I didn't have. I didn't have money to get those things, and was too shy to network with others to get them. Math allowed me to stay in my niche. Over time, I would become annoyed with how stagnant engineering became for me. As another poster mentioned, math is as deep as it is broad; engineering became more-and-more about the same topics, but with different details. This bored me. I was in many engineering clubs in high school, but my passion for it began to die. On the flip side, my passion for math was growing rapidly.      As a result, I'm in college right now studying mathematics instead of engineering. I don't regret any bit of it. Every now & then, I'll pull out my old project & give it a fresh look. I've had a few new ideas doing that, that I'm still exploring."

math,3cx3yi,Hairy_Hareng,4,Sat Jul 11 15:28:32 2015 UTC,"Well for starters they're a duality on the space of convex functions which is non-trivial sort of in the same sense that the Fourier transform is a non-trivial duality on L2 functions (you can actually make a slightly suggestive chart comparing the two, with the Legendre transform being the 'max-plus agebra version' of the Fourier transform but I don't think the connection is very deep). So if it helps you might think of it as transforming a function into 'slope space.'  Also they have a fairly important characterization that if a (convex) function f has a convex conjugate g, then f' and g' are inverse functions of each other (this tells you why the concept really only makes sense for convex functions, the set of differentiable convex functions is precisely the set of functions whose derivatives are monotonically increasing. Note however that the notion of a convex conjugate doesn't depend on differentiability, or actually even being convex).  They probably show up in a lot of applications I'm unaware of but I know they show up a fair amount in physics (in thermodynamics conjugate variables are related by Legendre transforms and in classical mechanics the transition from Lagrangian to Hamiltonian mechanics is a convex conjugate)."

Let p(x) be a probability distribution, and let p(x|t) = p(x) exp(tx) be a tilted exponential family with ""core"" p(x). Let C(t) = log \int p(x|t) be the moment generating function and D(mu) its dual.  How can I caracterize a member of the family p(x|t) ? Obviously, I can caracterize him by his specific value t0 from which I can deduce his mean from the derivative C'(t), BUT I can also caracterize that guy from his mean ! each member has a different mean ! If I characterize a member by his mean, then I must use D'(mu) to recover his t  So there is a dual representation of the family p(x|t): either you parametrize it in terms of natural parameters t, or in terms of moments mu  I had seen that result before ^^ I'm slightly embarrassed not to have remembered  Thank you again"

For example, for a symmetric 3x3 matrix A with eigenvalues E1, E2, and E3, let S2(A) = E1*E2 + E2*E3 + E3*E1 (often called sigma-2 in the literature).

(Taking the negative is a reflection in one direction in the complex plane, taking the conjugate is a reflection in the orthogonal direction).  Multiplication by a complex number can be thought of as a rotation plus a scaling. A complex conjugage keep the same scaling, but rotates in the opposite direction by the same amount.  So add a complex number to it's conjugate and you get a real number. Multiply a complex number with it's conjugate and you get a real number.  Others probably have more insight."

math,3cvsor,charlesbukowksi,69,Sat Jul 11 04:48:37 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you mean by dimension. For example, in the context of vector spaces, dimension refers to the number of vectors in a basis, which, when finite, would always be an integer.  On the other hand, geometrically we can look at dimensions this way. Consider a line. If you double the line, the line doubles (tautologically!), it gets bigger by a factor of 2. On the other hand, consider a square. If you double some line in the square (a side, or a diagonal, or a perimeter, or really any particular line), you get a square with 4 times the area, and 4 = 22. If you double some line in a cube, the volume of the cube goes up by 8 or 23.  We see that the exponent corresponds to the number of dimensions these figures have.  But now look at the Sierpinski triangle.  If you double a line, you end up with 3 triangles each identical to the original. This tripling corresponds to an exponent of log_2(3) because 2log_2(3) = 3. So in this sense, the Sierpinski triangle has a dimension of log_2(3) ~ 1.58 which is between 1 and 2 like we might expect."

math,3cvsor,Newfur,5,Sat Jul 11 16:37:36 2015 UTC,"The short answer: yes... and no.  The longer answer: strap yourself in, because we're going to have to dive into why mathematicians do things. Why do we do math? - Why do we create these weird new frameworks? Generally, it's to take an intuition, refine it, and then extend it in a sensible way. This justification will be important in a bit, but just keep it in mind for now.  Now, there are two ways you can refine the idea of a dimension. First, you can say: ""I want the dimension of an object to be the number of lines I can draw in the space it sits in, all at mutual right angles to each other."", and naturally, this has to always be an integer. This is what mathematicians call the ""topological dimension"" of an object.  But what if we care about other things? What if we say instead: ""I want the dimension of an object to be the exponent of 2x I need to put to have 2x be the number of that kind of object I need to connect to have an object twice the size.""?  Let me explain this a little more: if you take a line segment and connect a copy of it to itself in a straight line, you get a line segment twice the size of the original line segment. And sure enough, 21 = 2, and a line segment is 1-dimensional. Similarly, if you take a square, or a triangle, and arrange 3 more copies of that shape around it, you get that shape, doubled in size. And we see as well: 22 = 4, and the shapes are indeed of dimension 2, however you slice it.  Now let's get a little trickier. How many tiny cubes do you need to arrange to make up a cube twice the side length of one of the tiny cubes? Don't just read down - actually try this out, in your mind if you can, and with little dice if you want.  .  .  .  .  .  .  Did you get 8? Nice! And sure enough, 23 = 8, and we know cubes have to be of dimension 3.  Now, here's the important part: if the calculations we just did based on this new conception of dimension hadn't given us the answers our intuition gave us, if we had got 5 for the dimension of a line or 1 for the dimension of a cube, our definition would be wrong, and we'd have to figure out how to improve the definition, because the idea of the definition is, as above, to take an insight, refine it into rigorous math, and then figure out where else it leads us.  So what about fractional dimensions? Well, consider the Sierpinski triangle. It's a fractal you get by taking a solid triangle, and then, wherever you see a solid triangle of any size anywhere, cutting out the middle quarter. So how many copies of this shape do we need to put together to get the same shape, twice the size? Well, we only need 3. What does this mean for its dimension? We know that for any a, 2{log_2(a)} = a, so the shape's dimension must be log_2(3), which is a little less than 1.585! This is between 1 and 2, as we might expect.  Or what about the Menger sponge? Here, we can't really assemble something twice the size, but we can assemble something thrice the size, and it will take us 20 copies of the sponge to do so - you can check this! So its dimension will be log_3(20), a little more than 2.726, which is between 2 and 3, as we might expect.  We call this kind of dimension the ""fractal dimension"" of an object, and it's generally incompatible with the Hausdorff dimension - the Sierpinski triangle still has Hausdorff dimension 2, and the Menger sponge still has Hausdorff dimension 3. But this new conception seems to measure how curly or crumply a shape or form is."
math,3cvsor,Raeil,4,Sat Jul 11 10:59:20 2015 UTC,"Awesome post, but with one small linguistic problem.  The way you're defining ""fractional dimension"" lines up perfectly with the definition of Hausdorff dimension.  If the Wiki isn't your preferred source, here's a secondary source."

math,3csd2a,DoWhile,55,Fri Jul 10 19:48:04 2015 UTC,"So the answer is yes I think.  Lets sort of unravel the steps.   I see a geometric reasoning for this, that essentially you're doing a reduction over the dimensions (1,2,3,4,5 is 1-dimensional, 1,4,9... is 2-dimensional, etc.) and the steps that you are taking either reduce or increase the dimension you're working in by 1, depending on how you look at things.  But instead I'mma go purely mathematical.  First I'm going to make up some terms, a number is n-dimensional if it is of the from xn, so 4 is 2-dimensional, 27 is 3 dimensional, 8 is 3-dimensional.  The series 1,2,3,4... is the 1-dimensional numbers.    So lets talk about an n-dimensional number, specifically its successor.  [; (x+1)^{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n}{\binom{n}{k} \times x^{k}}} ;]   Now if we look at the series you defined, we notice something strange.   1,2,3,4,5... 1,3,5,7,9... 1,7,19,37,61... 1,15,65,175,369...   These are all Nexus Numbers as wolfram alpha so nicely defines.  Lets look at the definitions of those series:   1 2n+1 3n2 + 3n + 1 4n3 + 6n2 + 4n + 1   or generally,   [; Nexus^{n}_{x+1} = \sum_{k=1}^{n}{\binom{n}{k} \times x^{k}}} ;]   These are trivially the differences between n-dimensional numbers.  You'll then quickly notice that when you take partial sums to find the odds, the series you start with is just 1  So the question then becomes, how are you forming the Nexus numbers, and I think I see a reason.  Hopefully this formatting works."

math,3csd2a,Surlethe,8,Sat Jul 11 05:31:49 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking about working backwards in terms of counting faces of hypercubes, generalizing the standard geometric proof that the partial sums of the sequence of odd integers is the squares.  If n = 3, consider the areas of cubes with side length m. This is the final sequence. Consider the sequence of differences of cubes. This was gotten as the partial sums of a sequence, with every other term crossed out. The crossed-out terms correspond to the number of faces on the previous cube.   I'm pretty sure this can be made very geometric, but this is where I'm at right now and I have to go to work :("
math,3csd2a,phyphor,6,Fri Jul 10 15:24:33 2015 UTC,"If you work backwards for any theoretical n, then the last line is assumed to simply be the values of the integers to the nth power, which is going to be:  1, 2n, 3n, 4n, 5n, and so on.  (The first term can also be written as 1n, but this is always 1, so I've simplified.)  And then you can simply calculate what the line before this looks like, where you are taking partial sums (and where n<1). It must look like:  1, 2^n-1, 3^n-(2^n-1)-1 = 3^n-2^n, 4^n-(3^n-2^n))-(2^n-1)-1 = 4^n-3^n, 5^n-(4^n-3^n)-(3^n-2^n)-(2^n-1)-1 = 5^n-4^n   In general, the mth term is simply mn-(m-1)n  But you got this line by crossing out every 2nd number, so it really looked like:  1, a, 2n-1, b, 3n-2n, c, 4n-3n, d, 5n-4n...  Or, before the crossing out, the previous line (or the n-1th line in the process):  1, a, 2n-1, b, 3n-2n, c, 4n-3n, d, 5n-4n, ...  (We can verify this by plugging, e.g. n=4, and we get, after crossing out, 1, a, 15, b, 65, c, 175, d, 369, ..., which matches your penultimate line.)  At this point we can stop and say ""what happens when n=1?  Well, the final line is:  1, 21, 3n, 4n, 5n, ...  Or: 1, 2, 3, ...  There is no line before it (there is no ""zeroth"" line), but if there were it might look a bit like:  1, a, 20, b, 30, c, 40, d, 50, ...  Which is: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...  And that works, because when you take the partial sums of that you get the positive integers! Which is nice!  So, we've kinda proven it for n=1, but that's not sufficient, but it is a good start.  For any n greater than 1, we will need to work out what a, b, c, d and so on are, we can't just state they're crossed out. Again, this line (the n-1th line) is calculated from the line before, so we can work out the partial sums. Essentially we can work out what the n-2th line looks like. And we can keep doing that until we hit the 1st line, or the n-(n-1)th line, which is the integers in sequence. (If we make a mistake and get to the *n-nth line, that's the ""zeroth"" line, which we already looked at.)  Now, it's tedious to write out the n-2th line, especially using reddit's markdown, but give it a try and see what it looks like, after simplification."

math,3csd2a,js2357,6,Fri Jul 10 15:23:58 2015 UTC,"In fact, the crossed out numbers in the ith row have the form [; a_{i,n} = \binom{k}{i}n^i ;]. The last row is entirely crossed out. This number has a combinatorial interpretation: the number of functions {1,...,k} -> {0,...,n} such that exactly i values are nonzero. This immediately gives a recurrence [; a_{i,n} = \sum_{j=0}^i\binom{k-j}{i-j}a_{j,n-1} ;]. (You get a function with i-j n's from a function with no n's and j nonzero values in k-j choose i-j ways.)  I can prove that the deleted values satisfy this recurrence. The proof involves counting paths in a grid. Write the rows in a table, aligning on the deleted columns. Example for k=4:  1   2   3  X4   5   6   7  X8 1   3      X6  11  17     X24 1          X4  15         X32            X1             X16   Note each entry is the sum of the number to the left and the number above (or above-left if the one above is deleted). We can also add a row of all ones at the top of the table and this still works. Then by following this back inductively, stopping when you get to a deleted entry (or a 1 in the top row), we can see that each entry is a sum of entries in the previous deleted column and ones, with each deleted entry or 1 occuring as many times as there are paths from that entry to the target entry. Such paths are well-known to be counted by binomial coefficients, and applying this to deleted entries completes the proof.  Edit: Of course the base case should be mentioned. But up to the first deleted column, we have a perfectly ordinary Pascal's triangle. Since [; a_{i,1} = \binom{k}{i} ;] the base case is correct."

math,3ct6z2,W_T_Jones,11,Sat Jul 11 05:52:41 2015 UTC,"Why is the Gamma function generally used as the continuation of the factorial? Let's say I'm looking for a function f that is supposed to be the continuation of the factorial. So what would be the properties f should have? To me it would be:   f(n) = n! for all natural numbers n f(x) = x*f(x-1) for all x where f is defined defined for as many complex numbers as possible continuous if possible if continuity is possible then also (real) differentiable if possible if (real) differentiable is possible then also holomorphic if possible   Now the gamma function is continuous, real differentiable and holomorphic and it has the first two properties (well kind of but close enough). However the gamma function is not the only function having all those properties. I know that it is possible to uniquely describe the gamma function axiomatically (for example demanding f to be logarithmically convex on the positive real number line). I've seen a few different ways to uniquely characterize the gamma function but except for the properties I listed above I don't see how those properties that can uniquely describe the gamma function should be satisfied by a continuation of the factorial.  What I am essentially asking is: If there are multiple functions satisfying the properties listed above then why did we choose to use the gamma function as the continuation of the factorial? Is it just because it is the first we've found historically? Or is it because it is the one that is easiest to explicitly state a mapping relation for (at least for a significant subset of the complex numbers)?"
math,3ct6z2,OnyxIonVortex,6,Fri Jul 10 19:32:56 2015 UTC,"Wielandt's theorem for the Gamma function says that of all functions analytic in the half-plane Re z > 0 that satisfy   [; f(z + 1) = zf(z) ;]  [; f(1) = 1 ;]  the Gamma function is the only one that is bounded in vertical strips n < Re z < n+1.  There's also another way in which the Gamma function can be viewed as the most natural extension of the factorial. If we consider [; z !;] as a function of a complex variable, the relation  [; z ! = z(z-1)! ;]   implies   [; \digamma (z) = \digamma (z-1) + \frac{1}{z} ;]   where [; \digamma (z) = \frac{d(\log z!)}{dz} ;]. In other words, [; \digamma (n) ;] is a certain constant, [; - \gamma ;], plus the n-th harmonic number.  Harmonic numbers have a representation in terms of an infinite telescoping series:  [; \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k} - \sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k} = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{n+k} \right) ;]  There are many ways to extend this series to arbitrary complex numbers, but the most obvious, and in some sense most natural way to do it is to just replace n by z:  [; \digamma (z) = - \gamma + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{z+k} \right) ;]  Integrating and exponentiating this equation, and imposing that [; 0! = 1 ;] and [; 1! = 1 ;], we confirm that [; \gamma ;] is indeed the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and putting [; \Gamma(z) = (z-1)! ;]we recover the well known expression  [; \Gamma (z) = \frac{e^{-\gamma z}}{z} \prod_{n=1}^\infty \frac{e^{z/n}}{1+z/n} ;]"

However it is obviously not possible to properly define what a ""natural continuation"" is."
math,3ct6z2,OnyxIonVortex,2,Fri Jul 10 21:31:18 2015 UTC,"The equation holds for natural numbers under all extensions of the factorial which fulfill the relation z!=z(z-1)! (with the appropriate differentiability requirements). But if we make the assumption that it holds for every complex number, we recover one of the definitions of the Gamma function.  I agree that the notion of natural continuation is not in general well defined, but I see it as a question of simplicity, of requiring the fewest extra terms. The same reasoning that leads one to require that the equation z!=z(z-1)! holds without any modifications for every z and not only for natural numbers can be applied to the equation above."
math,3ct6z2,W_T_Jones,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:53:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, now I understand. Thanks, that really is at least a bit more natural than the other characterizations in my opinion.   The same reasoning that leads one to require that the equation z!=z(z-1)! holds without any modifications for every z and not only for natural numbers can be applied to the equation above   Yes, of course. The problem is however that different continuations might generalize different equations from the natural numbers to complex numbers and then you have to choose which equation is more natural/important. z!=z(z-1)! is undeniable a very fundamental property of the factorial, the one you gave now less so but it's still better than the logarithmically convexity (the last two aren't even really a property of the factorial but of it's continuation)."

math,3ct6z2,ydhtwbt,3,Sat Jul 11 02:33:52 2015 UTC,"Purely algebraically, cohomology is seen as the algebraic dual of homology (if you're unfamiliar with this, to Wikipedia!). In this sense, the difference between Cohomology and Homology is basically... nothing! You flip the directions of all the arrows in your chain complex and you go home: take your chain complex (C•,∂•) and turn it into a co-chain complex (C-•,δ-•), and then the i-th cohomology group is Hi(C•)=ker δi/im δi-1; setting Hi(C•)=H-i(C-•) gives you back your normal homology groups.  The power of cohomology over homology, at least in Algebraic Topology, is that cohomology has a natural ring structure via the cup product; on the other hand homology, being the dual of cohomology, has a co-ring structure.* Most people are much more comfortable working with rings than co-rings; after all, in grade school we learn all about multiplication and not co-multiplication. I have heard an algebraic topologist quip on multiple occasions that there's no reason we can't teach grade schoolers co-multiplication, in which case we'd all be perfectly happy with homology. But alas, we don't, so cohomology rings it is.  By the way, historically speaking, the fact that cohomology has the ring structure and homology has the coring structure is purely accidental and something we just have to live with, although for topological spaces, homology is certainly easier to visualize than cohomology for most people.  *It's probably important to note that homology doesn't have the co-ring structure unless the homology groups are torsion-free, which can be achieved using coefficients in a field."

This is just the scenario that all of the 5 cards are out of the remaining 41-9=32 cards. If you draw your first card then the probability that it is one of those 32 is 32/41. You can't draw the same card a second time so the probability that the second card you draw is also one of those 32 is 31/41. The third, fourth, fifth card then has the probability 30/41, 29/41, 28/41. Therefore the probability for the scenario that all of the 5 cards are out of those 32 cards is 32/41 * 31/41 * 30/41 * 29/41 * 28/41 = 0.20857... which is around 20.8%.

The course was somewhat of a second course on the topic, Sobolev embedding, basic, interpolation theory, weak Lp spaces, (tempered) distributions, its Fourier transform, etc.   As an algebraic kind of person, is there any sort of application of all of these that can make me feel like I didnt waste months of study in poor grades and a checked box next to my name?"
math,3ct6z2,nenyim,2,Fri Jul 10 21:50:55 2015 UTC,"It can be very useful to solve PDE, at least show the existence and uniqueness of a solution. Distributions and Sobolev spaces are definitely the right setting when looking for weak solutions because everything you might want to do will make sense, whereas du/dx of a function simply continuous or in Lp doesn't make much sense in general.   There are theorems giving you the existence of weak solution (e.g: the inf of a functional respecting certain conditions exist and you show that this inf is solution of a PDE) and in general it's a lot easier to prove the existence a weak solution than a classical solution.  At this point Sobolev embedding become invaluable. The idea is that you can often show that the weak solution of your PDE has more regularity than strictly necessary (i.e: is in better Sobolev spaces than what is needed) and with Sobolev embedding you can hope, if the regularity is high enough, to end up with a classical solution. Even better if your PDE behave well enough you can infinitely repeat this step (my solution is in Hm so it's in Hm+2, something like laplacien u=u for example, then my solution is in Hm+2 so it's in Hm+4 etc...) which thanks to Sobolev embedding you will again often end up with a classical solution.  I'm still unsure about Fourier transformation however they end up showing up in so many problems and simplifying many others that it should be motivation enough. Tempered distributions are kind of as before (one of) the right space to consider Fourier transformations as you stay in the same space and everything is behaving pretty well in this case, which isn't necessarily the case on the distributions (in fact for some of them the Fourier transformation doesn't even exist)."

If you spend a year doing research and prepping for the GRE and do well, I would absolutely expect you to get funding somewhere at least for a masters, if not for PhD track position.

Matrices use a right-handed indexing system, with the row index being first, and increasing as we go down.  The column index is second, increasing as we go right.  I think that the thinking behind it is that a right-handed coordinate system is preferable to one where the horizontal coordinate comes first.  Also, when you multiply a ""a x b"" matrix with a ""b x c"" matrix, you get a ""a x c"" matrix as a result.  If we reversed the indexing order then multiplying a ""b x a"" matrix by a ""c x b"" matrix would result in a ""c x a"" matrix, which is nonintuitive.

Most 2D structures in computer science follow the same convention (as an example, GIF run-length encoding is done across rows). I might conjecture that it has to do with the fact that gravity runs vertically and limits how we build things (they have to be in ""layers"" to play along with gravity), so this row-then-column structure has become embedded in our collective societal unconscious.

No idea what to call it, but I can provide some insight as to why people claim it: Assume a sequence of characters from alphabet Σ is infinite. If we know nothing else, then for the value of a given substring, we want to select the maximum-entropy distribution due to the principle of indifference, which is the uniform distribution. In this distribution, the probability that a given substring never appears in the infinite sequence is 0. Yes, there are cases where the string never appears, but these form a subset of measure zero. So in a theoretical sense, in terms of self-information, finding out that a certain substring never appears would give us infinite information, which is infinitely unlikely (though not impossible).   Where this argument breaks down is that most of the infinite sequences we would actually have a reason to study have a substring that never appears. So in the ""real world,"" probability is nonzero. Also, it may be related to the good old expected value paradox. If you roll a die, you should expect the result to be 3.5 on average. However, you should also expect it to be 1.5 away from the average. In other words, it trips people up that the expected value of a function is not that function of the expected value."

Note the inclusion of the logarithmic function, the golden ratio, and the square root of a negative. It even goes as far as to list 4th and 5th ""i"" roots, so he was likely seeking a primitive root of unity. Actually, if you look at the tree, it includes e to the sqrt(+-)  He relates the doodle's ""tail"" to phi-1. Mathematicians argued and still argue over the values of n0 and n-1. We've had a lot of ideas, including the idea that any n-x = -( nx ).  To the right of the shoulder, we see what is essentially reverse superscripting. This is a common experiment before the logic encapsulation was developed (thanks to computers).  The important thing is not to focus on what it literally means.

The golden ratio is the exponential approximation of the Fibonacci series, which is why phix + phix+1 = phix+2, the classic equation in combinatorics.  It appears that what Herschel is seeking is the ""imaginary"" golden ratio, but he is still attempting to use the ""real"" numbers to deduce this. He might even be looking for an imaginary equivalent to e. You'll notice that he takes e to the power of the derivative with respect to x at the bottom of the doodle's staff. Because ex is presumed to be its own derivative, I imagine he attempted to rearrange them like so:  d/dx e^x = e^x e^(d/dx) = some logical translation of x.   It appears Herschel experimented with the use of Sodium hyposulfites on muriates of silver. He may have used them to develop early theories, and that curiosity may have even contributed to his original questions. Perhaps he was trying to derive the ""half-life"" of these elements, or a similar physical relationship? That would be impressive, considering that the concept of half-life wouldn't be discovered for nearly forty years after his death.  The upside-down triangle is notation in vector calculus. He likely used it to expand the sequences he was working with.  On a lighter note, the doodle seems to be a metaphor for the devil and the ""tree of the knowledge of good and evil"".  My hypothesis is that he was attempting to use the properties of the golden ratio to build a better theoretical basis for complex planes. Hypothetically, it would allow us to conjecture n-dimensional ""complex"" planes which more accurately describe physical space.  This is ultimately conjecture, but when considering these mathematical objects as tools, it makes sense why one would want to develop these kinds of structures."

Sodium hyposulfate (now called sodium thiosulfate) is used to dechlorinate water, so I wouldn't be surprised if he was trying to dissolve the silver chloride. It also, which struck my eye when you mentioned half life, decomposes when exposed to light. It becomes metalic silver and chlorine, the latter of which escapes as a gas. In fact, it's the chemical that turns black in photographic film. The black color is the silver. I don't know for sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if this process slowed down the more it was exposed, acting sort of like a radioactive element's half life.

In addition to useful information, the page also links to a lot of other resources.  GIST OF THE WEBSITE You'll notice that there is a common theme among the suggestions: prospects for an undergraduate math major whose skills are purely mathematical may be somewhat limited, but prospects for students who combine their math major with studies in a supporting area are considerably better. It should help a lot that your son does enjoy other fields, such as programming.  Combining a math major with coursework in an outside field, possibly in the form of a minor or a double major, opens up the possibility of actuarial jobs, software jobs, and business jobs, for example. This outside coursework depends on the chosen field (for example, someone wanting to get into software might pursue a minor or second major in computer science).  Another option for a math major would be secondary education, although that of course requires a lot of interpersonal skills. Like the other fields, this choice also requires coursework outside of math, which goes toward the teaching license that is usually required.   Those who wish to stick purely to mathematics will usually pursue graduate studies.  A HELPFUL BOOK A book that is often suggested is 101 Careers in Mathematics. It's now in its third edition (published in March 2014). It mostly contains profiles of people who have pursued math-based careers; about a third of them hold a bachelor's, while the rest hold advanced degrees.  COMPUTER SCIENCE? You might also like to ask the people at r/cscareerquestions/ about a career related to computer science. For example, here is a thread from an autistic programmer that you might find helpful.  ENGINEERING? If your son likes physics, math, and programming, then perhaps some kind of engineering shouldn't be ruled out. Here is a relevant thread from the engineering subreddit from an aspiring mechanical engineer with Asperger's.  DATA SCIENCE? Another career path that is quite big these days is that of data science. I'm not sure about the suitability of this area, but it might be worth looking into.   Getting a job as a data scientist or data analyst does require a fairly broad set of skills, mainly from computer science, math, and statistics.

I'm a current math undergrad who was diagnosed with Asperger's back in the days of DSM IV, so I guess my contribution may be useful here.   I won't say much about employment, as other people have covered that topic, and I'm not looking for jobs yet. I would echo the sentiment that the academic math community is pretty forgiving of lack of social skills, and also that programming is important in any STEM job these days, math research included.   That said, I think assuming that he is/will be a great programmer because he is autistic is probably not the best approach. I don't have any magical aspie computer abilities. I don't really like writing code much at all, but if the choice is between writing a few lines of code and doing something horrifically tedious by hand, I'll write the code. I guess assuming someone will be great at math because they are autistic is also faulty; I just happen to think math is pretty cool.  As others have said, ""real math"" isn't much like high school math. Rather than just ""taking whatever the next math class is each semester,"" you might want to help him find more outside sources. If you skulk around here a bit, there are a lot of threads recommending books for interested high school students. I've also heard great things about art of problem solving and project Euler.   Finally, I'm a little curious as to what you mean about him having no empathy. You probably mean that he is not very good at understanding other people's emotional states, and does not know how to properly respond to them (low cognitive empathy), since this is the technical sense in which empathy is generally used in the literature on autism. But that doesn't line up with the sense of the word empathy used in common parlance. In general, saying that someone has no empathy usually implies that they simply do not care about other people. Maybe this happens to describe your son, but it in no way describes all autistic people. Me not being able to easily read your emotions off of your face in no way means I don't care about you.

With a categorical variable, the interpretation of your coefficient is obvious. And if you have a value that spans a range of somewhere from 5 to 20 units, you don't have too many interpretation problems. But what if you have a variable that spans at most 0-1 by definition, and really for most of your sample falls between 0.5 and 0.6? Then your coefficient corresponding to a ""one unit increase"" becomes a bit weird, and in fact talking about a one unit increase becomes practically nonsensical. On the other extreme, to borrow an example from Gelman, if you're using a country's population in an econometrics model, your coefficient is always going to be ridiculously small, and at least for presentation purposes, this isn't necessarily ideal."
math,3cof7z,Neurokeen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:45:57 2015 UTC,"Well, spanning one to two is weird. Also, obviously you can't talk about a one-unit increase, but that's just as meaningless as a one-unit increase in the 2-unit span or the 20-unit span.

So for example, something new might start with a few dozen dummy 3 star reviews, and it will continue to show up as averaging around 3 stars until a significant number of people either rate it highly or rate it poorly, and the more people that vote the less the dummy votes matter."
math,3cof7z,wintermute93,8,Thu Jul 9 21:46:52 2015 UTC,Interesting. That's effectively a Bayesian approach where there's a strong prior for the game being 3 star quality.

math,3cof7z,wintermute93,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:31:10 2015 UTC,"Do priors on the reliability of data fit into the Bayesian framework as well? You could, for example, assume that ratings by more experienced, educated and intelligent users are more reliable."
math,3cof7z,True-Creek,3,Fri Jul 10 08:46:18 2015 UTC,"You can condition on whatever data you want.   P(game is of quality X|person A voted Y, person B voted Z,...)=P(person A voted Y, person B voted Z...|game is of quality X)*P(game is of quality X)/[normalizing constant]   You have some prior that the game is of a given quality (possibly a default for all games, or skewing it based on previous titles from the same designer, which would be more realistic), and the odds that a person would have voted X when the game is of quality Y can be calculated from their review history, which would only be highly spiked around 'very accurate' if the person was, in fact, matching popular opinion over several reviews. Better yet, rather than calculating the odds directly from their raw review scores everyone can be assumed to be a reasonably accurate rater as a prior, and then their actual votes can update this in a Bayesian way, so that a couple of ""incorrect"" early reviews don't significantly affect how the software treats them. After all, even if a person poorly predicted success on their first review we wouldn't consider them horribly inaccurate just because it happened once. You can keep expanding the various conditional probabilities and priors in terms of whatever other information you want into an extended Bayesian network.  It's worth thinking about whether or not this is what you want though. If someone votes a 1 on most 4-5 star games, and votes low scoring games highly, then their score will contribute the opposite way to what they intended; odds are that a low score from them means the game will be well-received. This is the rational thing to conclude based on their actual behaviour, but undermines the idea that a rating is ""the user adding in their opinion"". It also means that someone who poorly reviews only major games would boost the rating of a terrible game if they were early on in the review process (after all, things they rate terribly tend to do well!). I'm not sure how many users it would take for the effect of a single person to be 'averaged away' to within a tenth of a point or something. Alternatively, a clever user could do this: get a few bots to review large number of games according to their average score, which will make the bots recognized as very accurate very quickly. Then get them all to vote 5 stars on your random game right when you release it, and the software will give you five stars. Distinguishing sufficiently clever bot behaviour from genuine unexpected popularity would be a challenge, though not necessarily a much harder one than usual. The point is just that pure Bayesian conditioning alone can be tricked, the same way an innocent and kindhearted person can shit on your car and no one will rationally believe you. Accounting for the odds that someone is being deceptive requires tracking more subtle behaviour, pretty much by definition.  In general its a danger of probabilistic modelling to forget some edge case that would make a human suspicious. By not including it you have given it a probability of 0%: tautologically false (for finite probability spaces), and so no amount of evidence will make your program point to the concept, even if it would be obvious to a normal person. In the sense of bayesian evidence 0% and 0.000001% are infinitely far away from each other.  You might want to explicitly sketch ""odds that this is a real person voting honestly"" based on various bits of behaviour and other things like that. The Bayesian treatment lets you expand this network of questions systematically and update information easily in the final model, but it can be difficult to tell where to stop."

Nobody has commented so far that he doesn't have the right interpretation of a confidence interval or the claimed coverage probability?   What we want to ask is: Given the ratings I have, there is a 95% chance that the ""real"" fraction of positive ratings is at least what?   and    confidence refers to the statistical confidence level: pick 0.95 to have a 95% chance that your lower bound is correct, 0.975 to have a 97.5% chance, etc.   This is wrong for a couple of reasons:   Once you construct a particular CI, the interval either does or does not contain the true fraction of positive ratings. It is not probabilistic, just unknown, and so you cannot say there is a 95% chance of anything given your data. 95% confidence means that if we hypothetically sampled ratings from the same data generating process an infinite number of times, and we build a CI each time from these new samples, 95% of that collection of CIs would capture the true population value. This CI he uses is based on two tails. If you want a bound such that in 95% of hypothetical replications, your true value is above that bound, you want to use something one-sided as described here."

Note that all of these are computable, while the busy beaver function is not (this isn't a proof that the busy beaver grows faster, but just shows that there is a divide). The reason for this is the Halting problem - the busy beaver must halt, but it is impossible to determine whether any arbitrary Turing machine halts, so the function itself is impossible to actually compute, and in fact grows faster than all of these. Any computable function is captured by this growth that you're describing."
math,3cr4t5,vlts,2,Fri Jul 10 06:44:44 2015 UTC,"The fact that the Busy Beaver dominates all computable functions means that there is in some sense a limit to how fast you can have a computable function grow.   I suppose in some sense that the faster the computable function you define is, the longer it might last before it eventually gets dominated by BB.  I wonder if for any number N, you could you define a computable function f(x) s.t. f(x) > BB(x) for all x < N .  I suppose such a functions would have to exist, but it would be hard to tell if a function met this criteria as the values of BB(x) may be uncomputable. Hence determining if such a program meets this criteria could also be uncomputable.   Although I'm not sure... are values of BB(x) uncomputable, or is it only the function which is?  This ties to something about the halting problem I don't get - it's impossible to make a program that can determine if any arbitrary Turing program halts. Ok, I get that.  Given a Turing program, is there an oracle program which can be used to determine if that program halts?  I mean, what happens if you switch the quantifiers  there does not exist an oracle which can assess all programs   but   for all programs, does there exist an oracle which could assess it?"
math,3cr4t5,antonfire,4,Fri Jul 10 07:58:20 2015 UTC,"Given a Turing program, is there an oracle program which can be used to determine if that program halts?   Of course, for some Turing machines, yes, there is such an oracle. Some Turing machines just never halt on any input, for instance. But there are also Turing machines for which there is not such an oracle. For instance, there is a Turing machine S which will, given a description of a turing machine T and an input I, simulate what happens when you run T with input I. (In other words, you can move complexity from the Turing machine to the input.) If there were an oracle for S, there would be an oracle for all Turing machines.  On the other hand, if you are asking whether, given any Turing machine T and any input I, is there an oracle which will correctly answer whether T will halt when given I, the answer is obviously yes. Either the oracle that always answers ""yes"" or the oracle that always answers ""no"" will do. You just don't know which.  This is related to your other question as well. Strictly speaking it doesn't make sense to ask whether a single number is uncomputable. There's always a program that will output that number, just perhaps a very long one. For the Busy Beaver numbers, they aren't even that long. If you know which Turing machine of size N takes the longest time to halt, you simulate it until it halts and then you output how long that took. So there's a program of size not much larger than N which outputs BB(N). But we don't know which program it is. So the next question is, is there a program which we can actually prove outputs BB(N)?  Somewhat more precisely, is it the case that for every N, we can prove one of the following statements? ""BB(N) = 1"", ""BB(N) = 2"", ""BB(N) = 3"", etc.. If I remember correctly, the answer is no. In fact, there's a reasonably small number N for which we cannot prove any upper bound on BB(N) using the usual axioms of math.  Here's a rough sketch of why. Suppose I could prove some upper bound for BB(100000). Then, given any Turing machine of size up to 1000000, I can either prove that it halts or prove that it doesn't. But this includes the Turing machine which looks for a proof of the Godel statement, which boils down to the self-referential ""this statement has no proof in this system of mathematics"". So either I can prove that the Godel statement has no proof, or disprove it, which means (because of its self-referentialness) either I can prove the Godel statement itself, or disprove it. And we know from Godel's theorem (or just arguing directly) that neither of those is possible.  Take those last couple of paragraphs with a grain of salt, though, it's easy to lose track of some subtlety in this sort of argument and I haven't actually looked up any of these facts recently."
math,3cr4t5,antonfire,3,Fri Jul 10 10:43:53 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking it doesn't make sense to ask whether a single number is uncomputable.   You can ask if a certain real number is computable or not (example Turing's proof of the countability of computable numbers / uncountability of uncomputable numbers).  while f(x)=BB(x) is an uncomputable function and there is no procedure which can find all values of BB(x), you can still find the values of BB(x) for certain values x - can you find them all perhaps using different procedures? You did get that this was what I was wondering and responded to it.   Don't really understand the Godel proof well enough at this time to comment on your proof sketch though."
math,3cr4t5,antonfire,2,Fri Jul 10 16:17:50 2015 UTC,"You're right, I should have said natural numbers.  Here's a slightly more ""black box"" perspective on that proof sketch. Roughly, Godel's incompleteness theorem tells us that there's some statement which we can't prove or disprove. All I'm saying is that we can take that statement to be of the form ""this here Turing machine halts on this here input"". Once you have a statement of that form which you can't prove or disprove, you have a number N for which you can't prove an upper bound on BB(N).  If I may wax philosophical a bit more, the point is that there's a big difference between the existence of a correct procedure for working out whether Turing machines of size and input up to 1000000 halt, and the existence of a provably correct decision procedure like that. Knowing an upper bound on BB(1000000) lets you write down a correct decision procedure. Proving an upper bound on BB(1000000) lets you write down a provably correct one."

For instance, there is a Turing machine S which will, given a description of a turing machine T and an input I, simulate what happens when you run T with input I.

Given any Turing machine and any input, is there any procedure which could be used to generate an oracle to determine if this turning machine halted or did not halt?

You're not justified in claiming that it's theoretically impossible that there might be somewhere, in some world, something more powerful than a Turing machine. You don't get a contradiction from imagining a magic box that can answer the halting problem.

You can ""define"" f(x) as BB(N) + 1, and then since f(x) is just a number, it's computable.   However, figuring out what f(x) is is impossible.

All you need to do is give a 'number' to g.  g is larger than any fk, so we can call it fω, then it follows naturally that h is fω+1 and you can keep going.  The choice of ω was not arbitrary, this construction works very much like ordinals.  We have a successor operation, and we have at least some limits.  So far you only have the limit of α+1, α+2, ... = α+ω, but you can go much further than that in a natural way.  However, at some point the natural choices disappear, at which point you can either stop, or press on in an ad hoc manner.  You can use the axiom of choice to progress even into uncomputable functions (so the Busy Beaver may no longer dominate), but this will be highly nonconstructive (and obviously uncomputable).  Edit:  To add, this gives a nice grouping of categories of fast growing functions.  You can define various equivalence relations (I like f~g if for some fixed k, fk dominates g and gk dominates f).

In any case, ordinal exponentiation can be thought of as functions with finite support, and the set of all functions from N to N that are 0 almost everywhere still has cardinality aleph0.  The reason for this is that there is no consistent way to well order the set of all functions between ordered sets.  Also 2aleph0 is beth_1.   It's only aleph1 if the continuum hypothesis holds.

The gist is here   given N, enumerate all proofs in Peano arithmetic of length N whose conclusion is of the form ""the Turing machine T terminates (on an empty tape)"", then simulate the execution of all these machines T, and return the sum of their execution times (or the max, or the product: these functions are so huge that it will hardly matter, in the sense that changing this will only amount to changing N ever so slightly). If we believe that Peano arithmetic is sound, then this function is indeed well defined (i.e., every Turing machine predicted by Peano arithmetic to terminate does, indeed, terminate, so we can run them all), and it will eventually dominate every function whose termination Peano arithmetic proves.   And the natural way of improving this method is to use a different proof system to reason about programs - in the first iteration he suggests ZFC and arrives at   given an integer N, the function F computes F(N) as follows:   enumerate all character strings of length less than N, and for each one, check whether it is a valid formal proof within ZFC (i.e., whether it is a valid sequence of lines, each line being either an axiom of ZFC or an immediate consequence of earlier lines by a rule of pure logic: all of this can be done with bounded checks), and, if it is, whether its conclusion is of the form ""the Turing machine <T> terminates when run on an empty tape"",      each time a proof of ""<T> terminates"" has been found, simulate the execution of T until it halts, and count the number of steps, return the sum of the numbers in question; let N be a reasonably large number, say N=101000 (as a kind of bootstrap), and return F(N)."

For any sequence of increasingly fast functions you specify (where each function is represented as a list of its values)   f0(0) f0(1) f0(2) f0(3) f0(4)....  f1(0) f1(1) f1(2) f1(3) f1(4)....  f2(0) f2(1) f2(2) f2(3) f2(4)....  ...   You can make a new function Fx(x)  f0(0) f1(1) f2(2) f3(3) f4(4) ...   which grows faster than any of them.

I'd always been a good mental calculator and saw patterns in numbers. Stuff that would probably be trivial to you guys.  Anyway I decided to learn more about it so I read up on some vaguely generalized categorizations of math and learned the basic outline of arithmetic/geometry/algebra/analysis.  So I went and bought four Dover books: Number Theory, Algebraic Structures, Elementary Topology, and Real Analysis.  I still remembered all my Calculus and Geometry/Trig from high school so I didn't have too hard of a time getting through them.  After that I felt really well versed and well armed. Eyes opened to 20 time as much math as I knew before. And of course to the far vaster universe of math I still didn't know.  I then borrowed a friend's DiffeQ/vectorcal/linear algebra books, got through those.  Ordered a book online about partial diferential equations and the calculus of variations. It was hilarious how unable to follow it I was.  I just laughed about it and went back to studying stuff at my level. Complex analysis. The introductory levels of partial differential equations. Learned a little CoV from wikipedia.  Read Euclid's Elements. Not super challenging but obviously super fun.  Worked my way through ""Proofs from the Book"" which was challenging but I loved it. Didn't put it down until I was able to intuitively understand every proof. It took me a month.  Watched a ton (and still watching a ton) of MIT courses online.  Read two books on combinatorics and one on modern geometries.  I don't have any plans with any of this, it's just an ongoing thing for fun basically.  edit: Also, although I'm not a mathematician by any means and have a long way to go, I love teaching it. If anyone feels like they could learn something I mentioned or something roughly in that skill range, I'd be happy to help them by recommending books, sites, and any explanation/clarification they want.

math,3csb77,lurking_quietly,6,Fri Jul 10 18:19:29 2015 UTC,"Density, in the topological/metric space sense, is only indirectly related to the size/cardinality of a subset of some ambient space. We obviously need ""enough"" elements of a subset to be close to everything else in the ambient set. But there's no requirement that a dense subset D of S have the same cardinality as S.  You're correct that in the sense of cardinality, there are ""more"" irrational numbers in a given nondegenerate interval [a,b] than there are rational numbers. But density doesn't require having the ""biggest possible"" cardinality as a subset of your ambient set. Instead, it just requires—in a metric space, at least—that each point in the ambient set S set is arbitrarily close to some point in the subset D of S.   So in S := [a,b], can we get as close as we want to any point in S by points of D := S∩Q? Yes, and this is what is means for D to be dense in S. It is also true that S\D = S∩(R\Q) is also dense in S. They're not mutually exclusive.  So density and cardinality are ultimately describing different properties of a (sub)set D of some given set S. You can have ""bigger"" subsets of S := [a,b] in the sense of cardinality that aren't dense in S. For example, D := [0,1] has cardinality aleph_1 beth_1, but it's not dense in the ambient set S := [0,2]. In particular, you can't get arbitrarily close to the point 1.5 in S using points of D.  On the other hand, [0,2]∩Q is dense in [0,2], even though it has cardinality aleph_0. It's therefore not enough for a subset D of S to be ""big enough""; the points in D must also be ""well-distributed"" in S, so to speak.    TL;DR: Cardinality and density are different concepts, and they're related to each other only indirectly. It is therefore perfectly reasonable that a subset D, ""smaller"" than its ambient set S, could be dense in S."

But I can barely take half an hour of the news or drama shows before I'm ready to turn it off. Even as a kid, I was never really good at watching TV.    On the other hand, I'm pretty good at making tea. I didn't used to be, but once I gave up soda, I got a lot of practice with it. I found I really enjoyed it, and I decided I would start doing it every day. I'm really good at making tea.     Being 'bad at math' (or 'good at math', or good or bad at anything at all, for that matter) sounds to me as absurd as all three of the paragraphs above. (All three are very true, though).  ""Bad"" and ""good"" are offensively inarticulate words to describe anything. Instead of detailing anything meaningful about your (or anyone's) ability, they only work to reveal your insecurities (or condemnations). The reason my examples above seemed so absurd is because no one feels insecure about their ability to eat, watching TV, or making tea. There is nothing to attach your ego to, so there is no need to talk about being ""good"" or ""bad"" at them.  So much of what gets in the way of learning anything is ego. When you're labeled as bad at something, or when you struggle with it, you naturally try to hide your failure. You revolt. You demand to know why it's useful. You try to avoid it. And if there is any aspect of it that you enjoy, you cling to it. You dismiss it, because that's how you can justify your difficulties.  If someone who is 'bad at math' (or any subject) is to overcome it later in life, they certainly have to overcome their ego along with it. For this kind of thing to happen, there usually has to be some kind of additional circumstance. Perhaps getting interested in science or programming or heavy into philosophy or maybe something less academic like playing poker where some proficiency in math is needed.   There are of course variations in natural talent and ability. And perhaps for an unlucky subpopulation, learning something as technical as mathematics is really not really possible for whatever reason. But you cannot know that a priori. And until you make a serious, committed attempt at learning whatever skill you want, you can't really say anything material about your aptitude.

math,3ctks0,tactics,2,Fri Jul 10 18:06:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how broadly you're defining ""wrong answer"" to be,  but there's one kind of wrong answer I'm familiar with, and that's inconsistent statements. They're quite easy to construct. For example, algebra/arithmetic errors can easily produce inconsistent statements.  4x = 8 x = 3 // uh oh, made a mistake here  4*3 = 8 // plug my answer back into the equation 12 = 8 // obtain blatant contradiction   I'm sure other Redditors here can come up with more fancy and non-intuitive contradictions, but I've opted for a straightforward demonstration.  What's so special about inconsistent statements, you might ask. Well, in the logical systems most commonly taught (implicitly and explicitly) in high school and college, there's something called the Principle of Explosion. In Latin, that's ex falso quodlibet, meaning ""from a falsehood, anything follows"".  What that means is basically, if you assume a contradiction (believe a statement is both true and false), then you can prove any sentence or its negation. Math would become quite useless if any Joe Schmoe could prove anything! Armed with a contradiction, you could prove gravity goes in the opposite direction, the sun goes around the Earth and that traffic in New York doesn't exist!  What if, somewhere, deep in the bowels of math, there exists a true statement (something derivable from the laws of math) that is also obviously false? Would all of math collapse? Would the schools close down... would math stop being useful? Of course not.  This has happened before, and it was called Russel's Paradox. Of course, the sky didn't fall because a system of math was found to be inconsistent. What happened was that new rules were introduced so that the system became consistent again.  Out there, a lot of mathematicians study the foundations of mathematics. People who ponder these questions about mathematical logic, and consistent axiomatic systems. Interestingly, there is a field of mathematical research called paraconsistent logics, the goal of which is to study systems that can tolerate contradiction (perhaps by removing or modifying the Principle of Explosion).  But that's outside the scope of my little essay here. You've asked a simple question with deep answers."

Also, if the measurements turn out to not be exact, then there may be no correct mathematical solution, and you're going to have to settle for a least-squares approximation on one level or another.

This is an issue with the countability of the sample space. If we take the sample space to have uncountably infinite possible outcomes (the real interval [0,1]) then the probability of a random variate manifesting at exactly a specific value is exactly 0. In that sense, it will literally never occur. Not your colloquial 'almost never but just barely have the chance of occurring'.  If, however, we are considering a countable sample space (say percentages up to two decimal places) then the probability for any choice of outcome will have positive measure."

In an uncountable sample space, any single value does indeed have a zero probability chance of occurring, and this is the definition of almost never (not some colloquial hand-wavy bullshit).

To expand, the likelihood of a person saying ""I lie 50% of the time""  lying x%of the time is exactly x%, since the statement in the OP is (almost) always a lie.   Using Bayesian Inference, if we have a uniform prior, we can then update our prior: (let 0 < x < 1 be the event of someone lying a proportion x of the time, and E the event of that person saying ""I lie 50% of the time), we have p(x) = 1, p(E | x) = x.   Then (using bayesian inference), the posterior is proportional to p(x) = x * 1. This has an integral of 0.5 on the interval [0,1], meaning that the actual posterior (which must be normalized to have an integral of 1) is p(x) = 2x. Then, the expected value of x is the integral of x * 2x on the interval [0,1], which is 2/3.  In conclusion, on average, assuming no prior information about the probablity of someone lying, after observing this statement, we can assume they are lying on average 66.6% of the time."

Then, the probability that they were telling the truth is.. Exactly 50%!  But what if they say ""I lie at least 75% of the time""? Then the probability that they were telling the truth is only 10%. On the other hand, if they say ""I lie at least 25% of the time"", the probability that they were telling the truth is 90%.  Here's one way to visualize the situation. Draw a 1x1 square, and a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right. You should imagine ""above the line"" as telling a lie, and ""below the line"" as a truth. The horizontal position is the likelihood that the person will lie: as you move right, the chance of lying (being above the line) increases.  Now suppose someone says ""I lie at least 75% of the time"". There are two possibilities: First is that the person is telling the truth, and they do lie at least 75% of the time. In your square, this is the triangular region below the line, and to the right of a vertical line drawn 75% of the way across. (Call this vertical line L). Second option is they are telling a lie, and lie less than 75% of the time, which is the region above the line and to the left of line L. Now the 'lie' triangle is 1/10 the size of the 'truth' triangle, hence 10%."

Everyone is aware of how often they lie; each statement they make is randomly and unmistakably true or false.  Furthermore, the custom in this universe is for the first statement they make to someone to be of the form: ""I lie x% of the time"". If they are speaking falsely, they will choose one of the other two percentages equiprobably. (x is only ever 25, 50, or 75)  So ""someone"" says upon meeting you ""I lie 50% of the time"", what is the probability that they are lying?  Well, if we imagine 600 residents, 200 will be 50%ers and 100 of them will make this statement truthfully. 200 will be 25%ers and a quarter of them will lie, half saying they are 75%ers but 25 will make the statement we heard falsely. Similarly, 200 will be 75%ers and three quarters of them will be lying; 75 saying they were 25%ers and 75 saying they were 50%ers.

The second statement is ""I lie 50% of the time.""  There are 4 possible outcomes: (T/F)/(T/F). TT: contradiction. If the second statement is true, the first must be false. TF: contradiction. Due to the conditions, second statement must be true. FT: valid. FF: valid. 50%.  Now say that they have one answer: immediate contradiction. 50% is meaningless if a statement must be completely true or completely false. This extends to all odd numbers (e.g. with three: TTT, TTF, TFT, TFF, FFT, FFF. Second, fourth, sixth are valid. All end in F. Thus, if odd, must be F or it doesn't make sense).  Now suppose the person has an indeterminate number of answers. If n is odd, the statement is false with 100% probability. Therefore, the probability of the last statement being a lie is immediately 1/2 (distribution of odd numbers). There exist cases of even numbers of statements in which the statement is a lie. Thus, it can be concluded that the probability that the person is lying is greater than 50%.  EDIT: Kinda drunk, and need sleep. But this is gonna bug me. It's not too difficult. Now, assume 4 statements. Just to see what happens. Order of first 3 doesn't matter: 8 possibilities. TTTT: cont. TTFT: cont. TFFT: true. FFFT: cont. TTTF: true. TTFF: cont. TFFF: true. FFFF: true. Four statements are valid: TFFT, TTTF, TFFF, FFFF. Three of the four are F, so for 4 answers, can say with 75% probability that the person is lying. I suspect that the probability that a person is lying is (n-1)/n, where n is the number of statements (maybe). Nevertheless, the original statement stands: there exists a case in which, even if it's an even number, a person is lying. Therefore, the probability is greater than 0. Thus, (0.5)(1)+(0.5)(eps) > 0.5 where 1 > eps > 0. Original answer stands.   EDIT2: zzzzz... So, if it's even, the order of the first n-1 choices doesn't matter. There are n possibilities (T... TTT, T... TTF, T... TFF, etc.). Tack on a T/F at the end, 2n possibilities. NOW... assume that the last answer is true. The only way this holds is if n/2-1 answers are also T. Only one valid configuration exists. Now, assume that the last digit is F. All answers are valid unless n/2 of the digits are F. Again, only one exists (which is invalid), meaning there are n-1 valid possibilities if the last digit is F. So, a total of n valid possibilities, with n-1 of them ending in F. As such, for any even n, you can say with a probability of (n-1)/n that the answer will be false... Noting the fact that (n-1)/n approaches 1 asymptotically...   As such, the overall probability of the last answer being false approaches 1 asymptotically."
math,3cmqhf,Arve,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:53:27 2015 UTC,"The statement itself is somewhat paradoxical, because whether it is true depends on when you examine the statement:  If I tell one truth, and then make the statement ""I lie 50% of the time"", the statement is false, because:   Prior to making the statement, I was telling the truth 100% of the time If I say ""I lie 50% of the time"" as my second statement, I just lied, because the previous state was 100% truth.  Thus, I was lying when I said it, and I have still lied 100% of the time.   However, if you do not analyze statements in real time and in isolation, but you only consider the sum of statements, the statement is true, and whoever spoke it has been speaking truth 50% of the time.

Concretely: if we ask, ""Do you ever lie?"", he either answers ""yes"" or ""no"". If ""yes"", we know that that is the truth, otherwise his initial statement saying that he lies 50% of the time (or really, any % greater than 0) is contradictory. If ""no"", then it's obvious that that is a lie as well. Assuming his response to questions is independent of his response to previous questions, then by repeatedly asking ""Do you ever lie?"" and keeping track of his responses, we should be able to figure out with arbitrarily high precision/probability what his true p is."

math,3cnguq,___Rusty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:35:21 2015 UTC,You don't need anything. The volume of anything dilated by a factor of r is is Ar3 and the surface area is Br2. Scale r by the right factor and the derivative of the the volume will be the surface area.

If you take a cube and stretch the 3 side-lengths by a small amount (leaving one corner of the cube ""anchored"" in place), the extra volume created is shaped kind of like 3 square slabs coming to together at a corner. Divide the volume of this shape by the thickness of the slabs and you have the area of three square faces (3S2) This is really the process of differentiating the volume formula for a cube: (S3)' = 3S2.   If instead you stretch the 3 half side lengths by a small amount, the center of the cube is anchored in place and the extra volume is like a hollow cubic shell. Divide the volume of the shell by its thickness and you get the area of 6 faces. (S3)'= (8b3)' = 24b2 = 6S2."

I have a PhD in Mathematics and a masters in statistics and I spent twenty years in industry programming at several different jobs.  Usually, the programming/statistics questions I got on a day-to-day basis were not particularly deep.  I could just answer them off the top of my head.  However, there were exceptions.  I had a job at a government research lab that was heavily involved with linear algebra and, despite being an algebraist by background, I found myself digging around in some fairly heavy duty algorithms.  (I mentioned the QR algorithm recently in a post on /r/math.  I learned the QR algorithm at that lab.  I don't think it is found very much in undergraduate courses.)  Fortunately, I found that, if I had trouble with a problem, other people would also have troubles with such a problem and we could talk about it together.  The lab was a pretty cooperative place.  Later, I managed a tech support department for a statistical software company.  We would get some pretty esoteric questions.  For example, we were once asked how to do Type II Linear Regression.  (This is different from OLS regression because both explanatory and response variables have errors in them.  Oh.  Yeah.  It isn't linear either.  That's something I found out by accident.)    Some of the callers wanted simple answers to complex questions and we just couldn't supply such answers.  We would normally suggest that they hire a statistical consultant if they were working for a firm.  For students, we would suggest they ask their advisors.  Still I was surprised at how many questions we were able to answer when the answers were not in the manual.  Once again, it was a fairly cooperative atmosphere.  So, take a shot.  If your coworkers are willing to help, things should work out.  tl;dr  Some you win; some you lose; some get rained out."

If you find averages of averages of things, then you will not necessarily get the same answer because averaging is not associative. For example, the average of 1 and 2 is 1.5, and the average of that with 3 is 2.25. But the average of 2 and 3 is 2.5 and the average of that with 1 is 1.75. And the average of 1, 2, and 3 is 2."

The notation itself is fairly meaningless. Functions and variables are always interchangeable labels.

As a result, you might think everything that looks syntactically right probably can be done, but you might not know the specific method for it.  In proof-based math, it's totally different. Nothing works by default! You have to labor to make things work at all, choose just the right definitions and conditions to make manipulations valid.

Start from the definition of the derivative:  df/dx =f'(x)= lim a->0 (f(x+a)-f(x))/a  You say that you can multiply both sides of the equation df/dx=f'(x) by some value to arrive at df=f'(x)dx ... so what is that value? (e.g., what is dx equal to... in terms of a limit or something else that can be in some way evaluated)   Try to write it down and you will either see the problem or will commit an algebraic error which makes it easier to understand where your thought process is going wrong."

I know some books (Stewart, for example) use this notation, and they define dx to be a small (not infinitesimal) change in x and define dy to be f'(x) dx, the approximate change in y from the change in x. I really don't like this notation, but it has made its way into some popular calculus texts."
math,3cmjrr,Umbrall,3,Thu Jul 9 03:43:56 2015 UTC,"I would just define it as a value approaching 0.   I don't think you get the fundamental issue.  Consider the following expression: lim x->0 (x/x) (e.g., the limit as x goes to 0 of x divided by x).  You can easily evaluate this limit by noticing that x/x=1 when x!=0, and then can evaluate the limit as x->0 by noticing that lim x->a (1) =1 for all a (including 0).  So lim x->0 (x/x)=1.  This works because the limit as x->0 is calculated without ever needing to evaluate the expression at 0.  Now try to do what you're trying to do, and write lim x->0 (x/x) = (lim x->0 (x) )/(lim x->0 (x)).  Lim x->0 (x) =0, so you can rewrite the RHS as 0/0, which is undefined - so your equality (evaluating each side separately) is 1=undefined... clearly false.  So your equation (that the limit of the ratio equals the ratio of the limits) must have been false.   when working with differentials where the notations is written as dy = f'(x)dx   It's another notational convenience for writing the equation dy/dx=f'(x), which for the reasons described above, is not formally justified (e.g., dy and dx in that expression are meaningless).  There are ways to  formalize it, but you have to replace the conventional definition of ""multiplication"" with essentially a delegate representing all the transformational issues mentioned above, so the expression f'(x)dx doesn't mean ""some value f'(x) multiplied by some value dx"", because there is nothing you can define for dx that leads to a meaningful expression there."

math,3cmjrr,orangejake,17,Thu Jul 9 05:31:30 2015 UTC,"So, there are two different ""formal"" ways to do what you're doing: Nonstandard Analysis, and differential forms.  The issue is both are sort of hard to conceptualize for someone who's just learning calculus.  You know how we have the rational numbers, and the real numbers? Nonstandard analysis uses something called the ""hyperreal numbers"" as its base, that are the real numbers with an additional element: the infitesimal (we can call it h).  This ""number"" has the property that h=/=0, but h2=0.  Doing this allows you to do the ""cool"" tricks like you describe in the OP, but at the cost where you need to talk about the underlying fields (instead of just working under the implicit assumption everyone has that it's the real numbers).  Then there's differential forms, and the algebraic manipulation you're describing is sort of confusing.  Teaching differential forms to justify that ""trick"" is sort of like inventing nuclear weapons to convince your neighbor to clean up after their dog.  Sure, it'll work out in the end, but why?  Also, I can't imagine teaching differential forms without some knowledge of single variable calculus, so this would have to come up eventually.  Pretty much, for this ""manipulation"" to happen, you have to define what dy means by itself.  This is really tricky, and you really don't want to have to do it in single variable calculus.  Even within an integral (so [;\int_a^b f(x)\mathrm{d}\, x;] ), the d x isn't really well-defined by itself.  It's just a notation untill you get to differential forms.

So individual dx here has no independent meaning. It is a convention. The differential dy on the other hand has a very precise mathematical meaning (somewhat complicated) and what is says is that if y is a function such that it's derivative dy/dx = f then its differential dy= fdx.

For example, you can ""prove"" the chain rule by saying that if y is a function of x, and x is a function of t, then you cancel the dx in the product (dy/dx)*(dx/dt) to get dy/dt.    But if you want to be completely logical and develop the theorems of calculus independently of intuition, then it is nonsense to treat dy and dx as ""infinitely small real numbers,"" because there is no such thing as an infinitely small real number.  Every real number, however small or large, has a definite size.  It is nonsense to look at a quantity like [f(x+h) - f(x) ]/h, and declare h to be an ""infinitely small number,"" which you can treat as 0 or ""not quite 0"" whenever it is convenient to you.  I said there is no such thing as an infinitely small real number, but actually there is a theory which allows one to enlarge the set of real numbers to what is called a set of ""hyperreal numbers,"" which are ordered in such a way that there are hyperreals which really are ""infinitely small"" (nonzero but smaller than any given nonzero real number) or ""infinitely large.""  The theory is logically rigorous and contains no contradictions.  Using the hyperreals, you can rigorously consider ratios of infinitely small numbers and completely develop the theorems of calculus by literally considering infinitesimals.    This is different from the usual way we do calculus and the usual way we consider an expression like dy/dx.  However, to understand the logical construction of the hyperreals, you will need some kind of logical/set-theoretic machinery such as ultraproducts, and this is rather tedious.  It's better just to think of dy/dx as something which is intuitively a ratio of infinitely small numbers dy and dx, but which is really just an expression for a certain limit involving y as a function of x.  In some calculus problem you encounter involving the equation dy/dx = f'(x), you may solve the problem in an intuitive way by multiplying both sides by dx to get dy = f'(x)dx, and then  integrating both sides to get y = f(x) + C for some constant C.  But the same solution for y is justified by a logically rigorous method, in no way requiring the consideration of infinitely small numbers.  Neither does any other solution of a calculus problem where you intuitively are thinking of infinitely small things."

Now imagine that you take a very, very, very small h, and say that dy=f(x+h)-f(x) and dx = h. This is of course not true, since in almost all cases our new ""dy/dx"" will not be exactly equal to the true dy/dx, but as long as the h we choose is small enough, the definition of a limit guarantees that we won't notice if the function is good enough, and then we can treat dy and dx as variables.

In terms of proving that you know this stuff to colleges, there are a few ways. Firstly, if you take the AP on your own, without having done a class at your high school, that proves you learned it on your own. From there, you can even skip the class and fill your schedule with other things.   I would also add that ""self-studying math"" basically counts as an extra-curricular, and when you're applying, you can list it. To give you an idea, on the common app, you can add any activity you want, and give a brief description, how many hours a week you spend on it, and when in high school you did it. If you list this, unless there are inconsistencies in your application, they will have no reason to doubt you.  You don't even have to do this alone. Approach a teacher, and tell them what you want to do, and they'll probably guide you through it (or refer you to a teacher who can).

If you run out of those, and your high school doesn't offer any others, consider taking classes at a local community college/regular college, but don't expect the credits you earn to necessarily transfer when you go to college.  2) Consider reading How to Solve It and How to Prove It. They will help expand your problem solving abilities and will help you understand what constructing proofs are like.  3) Learn a programming language, or a few. You might not ever need to program, but you might as well learn. If you take AP CS, you'll probably learn Java. Other languages you can consider learning are: Python (simpler than Java, popular in web development and becoming more popular in statistical/computational analysis), C/C++ (heavy hitters), R (if you like stat stuff), and Haskell (it's more ""mathy"", so you might like it more). I recommend Java (it is the most popular and sought after programming language in terms of software development), Python (easier to learn, popular in web dev (up there with Ruby)), and C/C++ (if you learn these two, other languages will be easier to learn).  4) If you get through with all of that, or you want more to do, look into some self study stuff.

math,3cjpgo,Germy_Widemirror,262,Tue Jul 14 21:02:43 2015 UTC,"Here's favorite of mine.   A professor of mathematics noticed that his kitchen sink at his home leaked. He called a plumber. The plumber came the next day and sealed a few screws, and everything was working as before.  The professor was delighted. However, when the plumber gave him the bill a minute later, he was shocked.  ""This is one-third of my monthly salary!"" he yelled.  Well, all the same he paid it and then the plumber said to him, ""I understand your position as a professor. Why don't you come to our company and apply for a plumber position? You will earn three times as much as a professor. But remember, when you apply, tell them that you completed only seven elementary classes. They don't like educated people.""  So it happened. The professor got a job as a plumber and his life significantly improved. He just had to seal a screw or two occasionally, and his salary went up significantly.  One day, the board of the plumbing company decided that every plumber had to go to evening classes to complete the eighth grade. So, our professor had to go there too. It just happened that the first class was math. The evening teacher, to check students' knowledge, asked for a formula for the area of a circle. The person asked was the professor. He jumped to the board, and then he realized that he had forgotten the formula. He started to reason it, and he filled the white board with integrals, differentials, and other advanced formulas to conclude the result he forgot. As a result, he got ""minus pi times r square.""  He didn't like the minus, so he started all over again. He got the minus again. No matter how many times he tried, he always got a minus. He was frustrated. He gave the class a frightened look and saw all the plumbers whisper: ""Switch the limits of the integral!!"""

math,3cjpgo,ranarwaka,13,Thu Jul 9 02:16:25 2015 UTC,"So there’s a far-off place that consists of a perfectly triangular lake surrounded by land, with three kingdoms on the three sides of the lake. The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people. The second kingdom is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power, too. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.  The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it’s a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armor and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armor and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.  The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and make merry, partying into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren’t as well off, but have their own supply of grog and also drink late into the night.  In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.  After dinner, he raises the pot up into the boughs of the tree.   The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hung over and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. When the squires from the three kingdoms enter the battlefield, the squires from the two more prosperous kingdoms scoff at the single squire from the poor kingdom. They decide to form an alliance to finish him first and then they will fight each other to decide control of the lake.    The battle lasts long into the night, and the combined squires of the two kingdom are not able to slay the solitary squire. However, the lone squire is also not able to take victory on his own. So after much fighting, squires decide that they are even matched and end the battle in a draw.  And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.  EDIT: missed a word..."

Now, le's look at f(x) = ln(x)/x. f'(x) = (1-ln(x))/(x2) which is 0 only at x = e, so there is only one turning point of f and it is at x=e (where f(x) = 1/e).

It then increases to obtain a maximum of f(e) = 1/e,  then decreases to 0 as x-> infinity. Graph.  What this means is that if we draw a horizontal line through the graph of f(x) = ln(x)/x so that it cuts through the graph twice (this is the equivalent to finding a and b so that ln(a)/a = ln(b)/b), then one of those intersections will be at a value of x so that 1<x<e.

math,3cj9ph,Godspiral,-15,Wed Jul 8 22:34:18 2015 UTC,Is there a proof that doesn't rely on sorta handwavy graph properties?
math,3cj9ph,SidusKnight,10,Wed Jul 8 16:39:24 2015 UTC,"How is this handwavy? Another way of saying it is that the function ln(x)/x is bounded by y=0 and y=e (for positive x). Furthermore, it is increasing monotonically until a fixed finite x value, and then decreases monotonically after that. This means that since we are searching for pairs of points, one of the pair must always lie below the finite x value at which the maximum is reached. That x value is e, and there are only two positive integers that lie below e. We know 1 won't work with anything other than itself -- that leaves 2. No other solutions can exist."

math,3cj9ph,bizarre_coincidence,20,Wed Jul 8 13:16:28 2015 UTC,"If you have made an attempt to solve it first, no math question asked out of genuine curiosity is stupid.  A good chunk of math follows simply from trivial observations, but a lot of those observations are only trivial in hindsight, and so even questions that can be answered with ""Just look at it like this!"" aren't stupid.  However, there are other large chunks of math that are hard.  Sometimes very hard.  And you don't necessarily know whether a question has an easy or a hard answer until after you finish.  Nobody thought that Fermat's last theorem was going to take over 350 years to solve.  The initial formulation didn't make it seem nearly that difficult.  And there are plenty of less famous examples of simple looking questions with surprisingly difficult answers.    So remember, just because you feel you should be able to solve something doesn't make it so.  If you make a genuine effort and can't solve a problem, then even if it easy to solve, or if you could solve it on your own if you worked just a little bit longer, there is still insight that others can impart to you, and so there is value in asking.  Sometimes, there is more value in doing than asking, but that still doesn't make the question stupid.  At the risk of sounding pretentious, it is important to be able to set ego aside and risk looking dumb by asking a potentially ""stupid question"" because the alternative is remaining quiet and ignorant.  The first step in the pursuit of knowledge is admitting ""I don't know,"" and so the sooner you can do that without judging yourself for it, the better."

After rearranging, you need a1/a = b1/b . This can be written as f(a) = f(b), where f(x) = x1/x . You then use calculus to plot this function, and obtain this image: plot. The key facts are:   f(0+) = 0 (the limit as x tends to 0 from the right is 0). f(infinity) = 1 (the limit...) There is a single maximum at x=e; f is monotonically increasing on (0,e) and monotonically decreasing on (e,infinity).   In order for f(x) = f(y) you have to have either x=y or x and y are on either side of the maximum at x=e. Without loss of generality, assume that x<e. The only positive integer choices for x<e are x=1 and x=2. With x=1, f(x) = 1 so it's impossible for f(y) = 1 if y>e since f has the horizontal asymptote f(infinity) = 1. With x=2 you get y=4.

It acts as a sort of trade-off: you lose some of your x-coordinate but gain some y-coordinate in return. A consequence is that in 4 dimensional space, you can actually rotate around two different axes simultaneously!  Also, google ""hypercube"" for some fun visualizations.   Generally speaking, we can't visualize 4 dimensions very well. And above that, it quickly becomes hopeless. But mathematically, these things don't become too much harder to work with."

When you are rotating an object of dimension n about a axis in the Cartesian n+1 dimension then you can ignore the n-dimensionality of the object itself. So it is the 'same' as rotating a point about a line.  This idea is called induction and even though we cannot ""see"" higher dimensional objects we can still discern some of their properties by this step-by-step process."
math,3cn42h,omeow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:16:48 2015 UTC,"A more abstract way to think about this is the following: Let X be any shape of any dimension, and let S be a circle. The shape of revolution of X is then the cartesian product X x S, i.e., the set of pairs of points (x,s). So for each point in X you have a circle.  Since the dimension of a product is the sum of the individual dimensions, and the circle is one-dimensional, we get that dim(X x S) = dim(X) + 1. So the dimension is increased by one, as you said.  As an example, let X = S, so we are rotating a circle around an axis, or if you will, for each point on the circle X, we get another circle. This is a (hollow) torus, of dimension 2. We can repeat the process, rotating the torus around an axis, and get the 3-dimensional ""3-torus"".

It's hard to visualize precisely, but all the points of the cube trace out their own circle in the rotated object, which does not intersect with any of the other circles.  The reason you have to add a fourth dimension here, is that the cube doesn't live in a two-dimensional plane to begin with, while if you want to rotate say a square you can do it in three dimensions.

math,3cofjr,captianmidday,4,Thu Jul 9 14:14:45 2015 UTC,"could I expect to find non-judgemental people there? Realistically, should I expect to be judged? Should I not expect a cut-throat ""ecosystem"" where everyone is out to prove how smart they are?   What, concretely, do you mean by 'judged'? Someone may be genuinely interested in your results, and ask questions about them. They may raise doubts when they don't understand your line of reasoning, but in honest faith. There's a decent chance that they might actually find a problem with your idea. Are you okay with that?  Part of the issue here seems to be that you're building a very large part of your identity around your intelligence and how others perceive it, and so become hypersensitive to scenarios that could be interpreted as challenging it and lowering your standing in your own eyes and/or the eyes of your peers (they probably care far less than you think, but I assume you've been told that a million times. Obviously intellectually knowing it and emotionally believing it are different things). It's part of normal mathematical discussion to try and knock down others' ideas and proofs, with the intent of strengthening understanding rather than discrediting the individual. Do you trust yourself to accurately evaluate whether or not someone questioning you or suggesting ideas is 'out to prove how smart they are'?  I would expect that there would be a couple egotistical people, but that most people would be well-meaning, largely helpful, and non-judgemental. However I would expect the above things to happen routinely. If they make you anxious regardless then such a group might not be a good fit.  Also, a good algebra/number theory book is Fearless Symmetry, by Ash and Gross. It takes you right from groups and basic mathematical thinking up to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Not enough to be an expert, but not shying away from the actual mathematical concepts either."

I perceive a lot of slights (etc) that are not really there.  One irony here I think is that math is a very logical, black/white discipline and you wouldn't expect mathematicians to ""sugar coat"" things when pointing out that something or someone is flat wrong. Meanwhile, I am (sigh) more fragile about that kind of than than most and yet I chose this field where you can expect to be called out when you're wrong (or...I did)  It's really no surprise that I find it rough.

In general I teach my students to do the following:  1.) Draw a picture.  2.) Create a coordinate system.  3.) Label known and unknown quantities relative to the coordinate system.  4.) Convert units if needed.  5.) Identify what is to be solved for.  6.) Create a mathematical plan by selecting the equation(s) needed.  7.)

Finding the simplest class of examples where something doesn't work will tell you where to look for exceptional behavior, which can give you some idea of what you need for a proof.

For textbook problems there are specific steps you have to take. If you want to compute a difficult integral, you try to simplify it via integration by parts or change of variables. For scientific problems  you have to prove certain properties or simplification of your mathematical objects first in order to apply some more general theorems that will solve your problem. And sometimes there are very standard, clear cut ways to do this. Sometimes there aren't, that's when you have to be creative.  The kind of problems we deal with very much have to do with the field we are in. My point of view is from functional analysis and spectral theory where a lot of the problems are motivated by physics (especially quantum mechanics). You often take classes of pre-defined objects and prove some general properties or try to classify them. Or you have a very specific equation or object (like operators that describe very specific quantum mechanical systems) that are not immediately solvable like a lot of textbook problems but you try to say something about solutions, spectral properties etc., often just in some special limiting cases.  For example the stationary Schrödinger equation for a single hydrogen atom is explicitely solvable. You can find all the energy levels etc. But what can be said about the solution for the hydrogen molecule or anything large. How do the wave functions look like, how smooth are they, what can be said about the energies."

If possible, run simulations to get an idea of what's going on before trying to prove it. Think about the ""key intuition"" you have about the problem (if any) and try to translate that into math.  When trying to prove a theorem, here's a common generic approach:   Try to prove the theorem about the specific examples. (For instance, when n is prime.) This is usually possible if you make the example specific enough. It may involve applying ideas/techniques from related literature. Come up with a reason or counterexample showing why your proof does not extend to prove the whole theorem. Think about why the theorem should still be true despite that reason or for those counterexamples. Go back to step 1 and try to extend your proof to cover this case as well. Repeat until every case has been covered."
math,3cieod,mc8675309,7,Wed Jul 8 13:04:31 2015 UTC,"Usually I get an idea from reading a new paper or going to a seminar, like seeing how a new technique could work on past open problem that I've previously considered.  Then I talk to people about connecting the two ideas, and invariably they are only familiar with one or the other (either they know the open problem, or they know the new technique, but not both).  Now I'm motivated, because connecting the new technique to the problem appears to be an edge that only I possess.  Then I struggle to learn the new technique and attack the open problem with it, and the devil pops out of the details and makes me ride a rollercoaster of optimism/pessimism that either results in a proof, or a failed pile of ideas."

math,3cmm7j,jackoconnell,3,Thu Jul 9 02:13:21 2015 UTC,"There are two ways you can look at the martingale system. Either you can regard each bet as an individual bet, or you can regard a series of increasing bets as part of one big bet.  If you regard each bet as individual, there's no particular benefit to this system. You could do a $100 bet, then a $133 bet, then a $178 bet. Or you could do the $178 first, then the $100, then the $133. Or you could be $1000, then $100, then $10. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Your 3:1 odds stay 3:1 odds for each bet, regardless. In this view, increasing your bets after losing is nothing but an arbitrary ritual.  If you regard a string of bets until victory-or-bust as a single bet, then the martingale does change things -- but not necessarily in such a favorable way. Say you have a $10,000 limit. You bet $100 on a horse with 3:1 odds, going for $300 if you win. 75% of the time you lose. Your next bet is $133 to cover the $100 loss if you win and your original $300 payoff. 75% of the time you'll lose that too (total of 56.25% chance of loss). Next you make a $178 bet, to cover your $233 of losses and $300 original payoff. Your chance losing this one is 75% of course, but your chance of losing all three in a row is down to 42.19%. If you do lose, you're in the hole $411.11.  Eventually, after losing 12 bets in a row (3.17% chance), you are $9170.79 in the hole, and can't make another bet.  So, you turn a bet that gave you a 25% chance of $300 payoff and 75% chance of $100 loss into a bet that gives you a 96.83% chance of a $300 payoff and a 3.17% chance of a $9170.19 loss. The expected value of your bet in both cases is $0. (This assumes ""fair"" bets with bookies not taking a cut, etc.)"

math,3citj1,Bollu,5,Wed Jul 8 09:13:52 2015 UTC,"For another example of ""proof by overkill"" that I particularly like, here's a proof of the intermediate value theorem by transfinite induction:  Note that the general intermediate value theorem is equivalent to the statement that if f is a continuous real-valued function on [0,1], f(0) < 0, and f(1) > 0, then f(c) = 0 for some c in (0,1). Suppose that f is a continuous real-valued function on [0,1], f(0) < 0, and f(x) ≠ 0 for all x in [0,1]. I will prove that f(1) < 0.  Construct a sequence a_α of elements of [0,1] indexed by the ordinals as follows.  Let a_0 = 0. Then f(a_0) < 0.  Suppose that we have a_α for some ordinal α, a_α < 1, and f(a_α) < 0. By continuity of f, there is some a_{α + 1} in [0,1] with a_{α + 1} > a_α and f(a_{a + 1}) < 0. If a_{α + 1} = 1, then we're done. Otherwise, continue the induction.  Suppose that for some limit ordinal α, we have a_β for all β < α, a_β < a_γ for all β < γ < α, and f(a_β) < 0 for all β < α. Let a_α = sup_{β < α} a_β, which exists because {a_β : β < α} is bounded above by 1. For any β < α, a_β < a_{β + 1} ≤ a_α, so a_β < a_α. Because a_α is a limit point of {a_β : β < α} and f(a_β) < 0 for all β < α, by continuity of f, f(a_α) ≤ 0. By hypothesis, f(a_α) ≠ 0, so f(a_α) < 0. If a_α = 1, then we're done. Otherwise, continue the induction.  If the induction never stops, i.e. a_α < 1 for every ordinal α, then the map α |-> a_α is an injection from the ordinals into [0,1], which is impossible. Thus the induction stops at some point and a_α = 1 for some ordinal α, so f(1) < 0.  One can use essentially the same proof to show that any function with positive derivative is increasing."

The bugs are placed randomly along the stick, and each is pointing to the right with probability 1/2. The bugs begin to move at constant speed (1 cm/sec), in the direction that they each face. Whenever two bugs meet, they bounce off of each other elastically. Whenever a bug reaches either end of the stick, it falls off. Find the minimum amount of time T such that, after T, all bugs are guaranteed to have fallen off.  Answer: First, suppose the bugs were ghosts that could pass through each other instead of colliding. Then clearly the answer would be T=100 seconds (there exists configurations which would take arbitrarily close to 100 seconds, for instance if the bugs are all placed in the first epsilon of the stick and all facing towards the other end). Now imagine each bug is carrying a flag, and that when two bugs collide, they exchange flags. Even though the bugs bounce back and forth, the flags march straight from one side to the other, as the bugs would have done of they were ghosts. Therefore it takes at most 100 seconds for all flags to fall off. But since each bug is always holding exactly one flag, the same applies to the bugs."

Note that this set Ui is just the set of integers not divisible by pi. The intersection of the opens Ui is open (finite intersection of opens is open). But open sets must be infinite, so there are infinitely many integers in the set of integers not divisible by pi. In particular, there are integers other than 1 and -1 in this intersection, which leads to a contradiction. But what is this intersection of sets Ui? It's just 1+(p1...pn)Z (edit: or could it be -1+(p1...pn)Z ? don't have time to check now).

An initial object I is one for which Hom(I,A) has cardinality 1 for all objects A in the category, i.e. there exists a unique map from I to each A. Let I and J be initial objects. Then there are unique maps f:I -> J and g:J -> I. Composing these maps, we get fg:J -> J and gf:I -> I. Since I and J are initial, fg and gf are the only such maps. But part of the definition of a category requires that any Hom(A,A) contain the identity morphism A -> A, so fg and gf must be the identity morphisms on J and I, which is equivalent to f and g being inverse isomorphisms, so I is isomorphic to J, proving that initial objects are unique up to isomorphism. But recall that f and g are the unique elements of Hom(I,J) and Hom(J,I), so I and J are in fact unique up to unique isomorphism.  The same result holds for final objects, and the proof is the same with arrows reversed.  This result is essentially just semantics, but it underlies any and all uses of universal properties (since objects satisfying universal properties are, by definition, initial or final objects in some auxiliary category). The uniqueness of the isomorphism is significant because it essentially tells us that the object has no internal structure in the form of automorphisms (for if we had an automorphism of I we could cook up a different isomorphism I -> J). Of course this lack of structure is category-dependent. The integers Z are initial in the category of Rings (where swapping 1 and -1 is not allowed), but not in Groups (where the swap is allowed)."

I think you've got a great plan there. I have been teaching this one 6th grader physics, mathematics, and computer science (python) and I must say that there are quite a few advantages to teaching a 6th grader over a high schooler. Mainly, it is that they are more open to challenges and willing to work through struggles. It is also easier to get them interested in things, especially tangible things. I think you'll have no problem teaching them computing and the like because of this (especially logic gates. Will you let them play with actual logic gate circuits? I love those.).   You ask if kids ages 10-12 are ready for logical, algorithmic thinking. I think they absolutely are. In fact, I'd say that's probably one of the best times to get started. In high school, I see that most kids have been brainwashed with this style of mathematics that is very cookbook style. They actually do worse at this sorta logical thinking (proofs and algorithms) because they are not able to move away from their very inflexible thinking style. 5th and 6th graders will not already have that cookbook style of thinking, and you should be able to teach them logical thinking successfully.   The problem that I came across when teaching that one 6th grader was that he sometimes did not completely see the importance of proofs and things like that. But that comes with time (or maybe I'm a bad teacher lol). Not much of a problem.   One cool thing I found that works when teaching people is teaching the history along with the topic itself (it worked really well with the 6th grader I'm teaching).  Well that's my take on this.

math,3cmpt4,whirligig231,6,Thu Jul 9 02:43:18 2015 UTC,"The construction of the Naturals as wintermute93 gives is how the axioms of ZFC (the `standard' axiomatic foundation of set theory - there are others) encodes it's 6th axiom; the axiom of infinity. The axiom is understood to us as ""there exists an infinite set"" but from the point of view of the axioms, that property of being infinite is not yet defined. We have the axiom there because we know what it will lead to.  Though now I disagree with wintermute. I think we do have a formal definition of infinity, which I quite like.   Definition: We say a set [; S ;] is infinite if there exists a map [; f:S\longrightarrow S ;] which is injective but not surjective.  Now this gives a lot of 'obvious' results pretty easily. The naturals are infinite: take [; f:n/mapsto n+1 ;]. Then 0 is not in the range of the function but the map is clearly injective, hence [; \mathbb{N} ;] is infinite.   Suppose you have a set [; X ;] which contains an infinite set [; S ;] as a proper subset. Does it follow that [; X ;] is infinite? Of course. [; S ;] infinite means we have a non-surjective injection [; f:S \longrightarrow S ;], so if we take [; F : X \longrightarrow X ;] to be [; f ;] for [; S\subset X ;] and [; \textrm{Id} ;] for [; X\setminus S \subset X ;], then again we have a non-surjective injection proving that [; X ;] is infinite.   So now [; \mathbb{N} ;] infinite [; \implies \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}, \ldots ;] are all infinite too.  The idea of the extended real line is not the same, though. I do not know too much about it though, but I doubt it's very well connected to set-theory-infinity... I might be wrong about that though."

math,3cmpt4,tactics,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:57:48 2015 UTC,"Well, obviously there's some intuitive connection, or else we wouldn't call them both infinite. Anyway, here's my definition:  Let a set U have the following defined on it:  1) There is some subset V of U called the sizes.   2) On V, we define a total order <= (defining <, >, >= appropriately) such that V has a minimum element, called 0.   3) On V, we define the successor of a size, S(x), such that S(x) is a size always greater than x.   4) On U, we define the size of an element, |x|, to be a mapping from elements of U to elements of V, such that the size of a size is itself, and the size of a non-size is nonzero.   Then we define a finite-closed subset of U to be a subset F such that 0 is in F, F is closed under the successor operation, and if a size s is in F then all x in U with |x| <= s are in F. We say that an element of U is infinite if it is excluded from some finite-closed subset.   For the Riemann sphere, we can define the sizes to be the nonnegative projective reals, the ordering to be the ""typical"" ordering, the successor to be S(x) = x+1, and the size of x to be the absolute value / norm of x. Then the only infinite element is complex infinity; the ""ordinary"" complex plane is the minimal finite-closed subset.   Let U be the set of all small sets (we technically need some form of large cardinal axiom here). Define V to be the cardinal numbers in U, define the ordering as x <= y iff x is a subset of y, define the successor function as the successor cardinal, and let size of a set be its cardinality. Then the infinite elements of U are precisely the infinite small sets.   I don't know if this is incredibly useful per se, but without it, infinity is just the same word applied to different concepts. It's nice to be able to point to this unifying structure."
math,3cmpt4,doublethink1984,2,Thu Jul 9 03:22:57 2015 UTC,"To emphasize what /u/whirlgig231 asks... why do you feel there ought to be a direct generalization?  At the risk of getting slightly philosophical, I'll voice this view:  It is more notable when things are finite. Having some finite aspect (cardinality, measure, dimension, or something more involved like the noethereanness or compactness) is a strong guarantee you have over something. It shows that you can count it. It is susceptible to arithmetic and to number theory. And with that tight restriction, you get leverage over the thing. You can start to prove lots of strong properties about it.  In contrast, being infinite isn't usually all that remarkable. Many times, it's not a property as much as a lack of a property. You can't count it or do arithmetic with it. It's unwieldy and hard to prove things about.  Obviously, not always, but it's just a viewpoint to consider when looking at a problem.  A generalization to encompass ""all of infinity"" is almost doomed to fail. It's like coming up with an algorithm for creativity: as soon as you've listed all the rules for how to do it, what you have is a program, and there is no longer room for any creativity.  There are soooo many variations on infinity. You list out two examples in your opening post and a few more below in your replies. But there are many more.   Another example that I haven't seen mentioned here are Grothendieck universes. These are sets which satisfy the properties you would expect from a ""set of all sets"". They are closed under all the standard operations on sets, union, intersection, pairing, subsets, etc. They play a role similar in spirit to classes without requiring an extra ""tier"" of sets."

These notions of infinity certainly can't be reconciled with each other, and I wouldn't expect either them to be unified with the notion of infinite cardinalities in any meaningful way.

math,3cle3v,Vulfmeister,6,Wed Jul 8 20:32:39 2015 UTC,The combinatorial interpretation of the binomial coefficient only makes sense when n and r are integers. A more general interpretation (which is also where it's name comes from) is to define nCr as the rth coefficient in the series expansion of (x+1)n.  Note that if n is an integer then (x+1)n = (x+1)(x+1)...(x+1) n times so the coefficient of the monomial xk is equal to the amount of possible ways to choose k of the factors (x+1) from where you get your x when you multiply it out.

The definitions agree when n is a nonnegative integer.   The polynomial perspective is useful in many ways.

Note I had taken the base from a website that calculated football elo rankings, so credit goes to them.  With 5 players I would suggest the gradings to be calculated like this:  First calculate the average rating of the 5 participants, then each can have a win expectancy defined by:  Win_Expectancy = 1/(10-rating_difference/400+1)  Note that if a person has exactly the average rating of the group, their win_expectancy is 1/2. This can be used to determine a new rating by:  New_Rating = Old_Rating + K * (Result - Win_Expectancy)  In this formula K is a factor that determines how quickly ratings change. Now, you can define 'result' to be 1 for 1st place, 0.75 for 2nd place, 0.5 for 3rd place, 0.25 for 4th place and 0 for 5th place.  In the case of 4 racers, you could modify the result parameter slightly, for example 1st is 0.9 instead of 1, 2nd is 0.65 etc. I'm sure there's a way to properly calculate how this can be adjusted.  This is probably the system you have been using already, or similar to it.

And all of these things are perpendicular intersection of the surface with flat hyperplanes, which means they should all be 'straight lines' along the 3-sphere itself. i.e. the same type of cut in the 'positive hexadecant' of 4D space should yield what in hyperspherical geometry is a perfect tetrahedron.

Don't read further if you don't want spoilers.  Take any distribution which is nonzero everywhere (e.g. a normal distribution works) and generate a number from it. If this number is larger than the one from the paper choose the other, if its smaller choose the paper you've seen.  The way it works is that if your random number is between the two values on the papers then your strategy will win 100% of the time. If it's either smaller or larger then it wins 50% (due to the initial guess). Since choosing in between has a nonzero probability, this means the overall strategy has >50% chance of being correct."

Let's say to generate all sequences of 2n properly nested parentheses. We do it recursively, but keep track of how many parenthesis we have open as a parameter. So our initial call is (2n,0). Then in the recursive call, we get in an (a,b), and we do a recursive call for (a-1,b-1) (that's adding a ')' to what we have done so far) and (a-1,b+1) (that's adding a '(').

math,3cjpmp,eruonna,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:12:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I know the Catalan numbers enumerate a lot of different things. Everything involving them and dynamic programming still seems just to be about calculating the nth Catalan number, though. I think it's interesting that C(n) is equal to the number of full binary trees with n+1 leaves, and that seems promising. I can see how you could take each of those trees and add two children to some vertex with zero children and end up with each full binary tree with n+2 leaves. But taking that approach would give you quite a lot of duplicates, so that is far from a ""nice"" algorithm"
math,3cjpmp,eruonna,2,Thu Jul 9 02:40:39 2015 UTC,"The Catalan recurrence tells you that C(n) is equal to the sum of C(i)C(j) over all pairs i,j such that i+j = n-1. The product C(i)C(j) counts number of ways to choose something of size i and something of size j, where the ""something""s are counted by Catalan numbers. So to build a something of size n, you combine something of size i and something of size j, with i+j = n-1 and no further restrictions. One of the common ways to prove something is counted by the Catalan numbers is to explicitly spell out this construction.  Edit: Another way to look at it: when computing the Catalan numbers, you have a base case which is a number (probably 1), and a rule for computing the next value by adding and multiplying previously computed values. You can use the same structure to generate things counted by the Catalan numbers, but your base case is now a list (probably a singleton list containing the unique thing of size 1 (or perhaps 0)), you replace addition with concatenation of lists, and multiplication with an operation that computes the Cartesian product of two lists and applies some operation to each of the pairs so generated. Essentially all you need to do is work out what operation on pairs is required."

Suppose that you flip two coins and someone asks you to choose one of the coins uniformly at random and tell them the status of that coin. If you answer heads, then the conditional probability that both coins are heads is 1/2.  More generally, if you flip two coins and someone asks you to tell them the status of one of the coins, the conditional probability if you say heads depends on the rule you use to answer the question. When you flip HH or TT, you have no decision to make. When you have flipped HT or TH, if you always say ""one of the coins is heads"", then the conditional probability of HH given H is 1/3. If you say ""one of the coins is heads"" with probability p in that situation, the conditional probability of HH given H is (1/4)/(1/4 + p(1/2)) = 1/(1+2p).

That has negation ""by some secret process P, I selected a coin. The selected coin is tails."" In the second interpretation, the condition probability depends on the details of P. The first interpretation is simpler and probably more natural, but the second one fits the statement as well.  When you say ""given a 2-coin flip and one coin's face"", you describe a situation with the same ambiguity: how was the revealed coin selected?

math,3cflrc,abig7nakedx,18,Tue Jul 7 15:11:56 2015 UTC,"Mathematically, variance comes down to the idea of a pullback: Instead of working with a set, we work with functions defined on that set.  Suppose S is our set and we have some transformation on S: a function φ : S → S which acts like a ""change of coordinates"". Given an element x in S, we can look at φ(x) to see what it would look like in new coordinates. As an important technical note, φ must be invertible because we want to be able to change back to our original coordinates.   But now consider a set S* which take elements of S as input and returns scalars. For instance, if S is the points on the surface of the Earth, there is a function f in S* which, given any point p on the surface of the Earth, f(p) gives the temperature at p. There's also a function g in S* which gives the elevation above sea level at a point on Earth.  Now take one of our change of coordinates φ above and a scalar function f in S*. We can't just apply φ to f because f is a function, not a point. But what we can do is make a new function f o φ, where the o is function composition. You often see this same function written as φ*f. (See Wikipedia's entry on ""pullback"" in differential geometry).  But if you play with this a bit, you'll realize it's important to have a sensible relationship between S and S* with respect to changes of coordinates. In particular, if φ(x) is x viewed from a new set of coordinates, we want φ*f to be f viewed from that same set of coordinates. But that's almost true, but not quite: φ*f(φ(x)) = f(φ(φ(x)) which is not generally going to be equal to f(x)!  How can we resolve this? What we want is really for that φ o φ in the middle to cancel out. That is, what we really want is φ o φ-1! As you can see: φ*f(φ-1(x)) = f(φ(φ-1(x))) = f(x), since φ and φ-1 are inverse functions.  In case that got a little hairy, the take home message is this:   If we perform a change of coordinates to the points, we must perform the inverse change of coordinates to the functions.   At the end of the day, it all comes down to pullbacks :)  Lastly, I want to leave two very simple examples. This stuff often comes up when you deal with tensor calculus, but you can see this kind of phenomenon happen with much less sophisticated mathematics:  First, consider the line x + y = 1. Compute the normal for the line. You should find it's just (-1, 1), up to a choice in sign. Now change coordinates with x = 2u and y = v. How does this affect the line? How does this affect the normal? What if you used x = αu and y = v for some other value α?  Lastly, a really easy one: Suppose I have a number x on a number line. (With positive numbers to the right as usual). Consider the number x + 1. It is x shifted over 1 unit to the right. But now consider the function f(x) = x2, whose graph is a parabola. If I then define g(x) = f(x+1), then which direction does g appear shifted compared to f? :)"

math,3cflrc,chebushka,2,Tue Jul 7 22:03:03 2015 UTC,"Thorne's classical mechanics text (and the classic GR text Gravitation that he cowrote) takes a pretty good standpoint. A tensor is a function of several vectors that spits out numbers, and is linear in each argument. Supported by a decent collection of examples (dot product, stress tensor, kronecker delta, component extraction, differentials, etc.) this lays out the geometric nature of the concept without really getting bogged down mathematically. You can clearly represent such a function by how it acts on all possible combinations of basis vectors, and the required component transformations are easily derived from the criteria that the outputs, being scalars, must be invariant under a change of basis. If anything I think that the difference between vectors and their duals is harder to grok than the definition of tensors (at least, if you restrict to tensors that don't take arguments from the dual space, which you can often get away with when first developing the subject in physics if you start within Newtonian mechanics).  You only really need the tensor product to turn said multilinear maps into linear maps on a different space, which isn't really a necessary or particularly helpful point of view in the undergrad physics usage I've seen."

math,3cflrc,afourforty,8,Tue Jul 7 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"Physics student here -- I'll try to offer an explanation that's a little more intuitive. First though I have to echo all the recommendations to take a linear algebra class; all of this stuff will get much more intuitive once you have that under your belt. A mathematician friend of mine has said that your success in life is directly proportional to how much linear algebra you know, and I don't think he's far wrong. (A word of warning, however: if you take a linear algebra class that treats vectors as n-tuples of numbers, you're going to come out of it more confused than you went in. A good linear algebra class is basis-independent from the start; if you want to be enterprising and start self-studying Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right is a very good place to start.)  Anyway, covariance and contravariance of vectors. Imagine you've got some sort of coordinate system, so you can imagine measuring everything with n rulers: one for each coordinate dimension. I like picturing this in 2D, but it works in any number of dimensions. Now imagine that all of your rulers shrink by a factor of 10. This of course means that when you measure something with your new rulers, you get measurements that are 10 times bigger than the measurements you made with your old rulers. In other words, your measurements transformed the opposite way (or contra-varied) from your coordinate transformation. So we say things like distance vectors and velocity vectors are contravariant under dilation.  On the other hand, now imagine instead of distances we're trying to measure something like a temperature gradient. We have a function T(x,y) that tells us the temperature everywhere in a 2-dimensional room, and from this we can get a vector field ∇T that points in the direction of steepest increase of T, and tells us exactly how much it's increasing at that point. Now we do the thing where we shrink all our rulers by a factor of 10 again. But instead of our measurements getting bigger, they get smaller -- because our rulers shrank, we measure less variation per unit length. Since our measurements transformed the same way as our coordinate transformation, we say that gradient vectors co-vary under dilation.  If you know a little linear algebra you can show that the same thing happens under any differentiable coordinate transformation, not just dilations -- once you've taken a linear algebra class I encourage you to do the calculation yourself; it puts hair on your chest. The basic concept is not hard though -- a lot of people get very confused by it because they're used to thinking of vectors as n-tuples of numbers, which really screws you up when you start doing things like this. Separating vectors from coordinate systems helps a lot with this (vectors are ""real world objects"", coordinate systems are artificial rulers.)   Fwiw, a mathematician would tell you that all this happens because vectors like distance and velocity live in the ""tangent bundle"" and vectors like gradients live in the ""cotangent bundle"" but I don't know any of that stuff."
math,3cflrc,Snuggly_Person,5,Tue Jul 7 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"Fwiw, a mathematician would tell you that all this happens because vectors like distance and velocity live in the ""tangent bundle"" and vectors like gradients live in the ""cotangent bundle"" but I don't know any of that stuff.   For this bit: On a manifold, you can consider all the possible trajectories through a point, and look at all of their possible velocities at the point: these velocities define a vector space which we call the tangent space at the point. You can formalize this in various ways: equivalence classes of curves f: (-1,1)->M with f(0)=0 up to first order, or make the vector space directly out of the linear operators that extract those velocities, etc.; they're all basically the same idea. The glued-together collection of all tangent spaces at all points of the manifold forms the tangent bundle. For example, if your manifold is a circle then the tangent space at each point is R, and the tangent bundle is a cylinder.  For a given vector space, we can form the dual space, consisting of linear functions from that space into the underlying number system (here it's R of course). I might have one function on 2D vectors that works like f( (a,b) )=a, and another function g( (a,b) )=a-b. Clearly I can add these and scale these to get other valid linear functions.  The physical relevance is that the gradient naturally lives not in the tangent space, but in its dual *. I.e., the gradient is an object that takes in a velocity vector and spits out the rate of increase of the function as seen by someone travelling at that velocity. It is a linear function from vectors to numbers. So the spatial gradient of temperature is really a function which, when handed a velocity, spits out the rate of change in temperature that someone travelling at that velocity would see. The collection of all dual spaces at each point, glued together, is the cotangent bundle. The contangent bundle has the same shape as the tangent bundle (i.e. in the above example it is also a cylinder) but they're not literally the same space; they both interact with other geometric features in distinct ways.    * This is slight lie: the gradient is defined as the vector that 'mimicks' the action of the true ""differential of the function"" through the dot product, but this is just a terminology thing. The ""mimicking vector"" still has to change coordinates differently than actual vectors to keep up with what the differential is doing."

math,3cflrc,Euthyphron,3,Tue Jul 7 18:18:40 2015 UTC,"If you really want to get the point of this then you need to take (a lot of) linear algebra. Without that you probably can't get any of this to stop soaring over your head, to use your phrase. Ultimately the distinction between covariance and contravariance comes from the distinction between a vector space and its dual space. On an elementary level, if A is an m x n matrix then it defines a function Rn --> Rm while its transpose matrix AT is n x m and defines a function in the opposite direction Rm --> Rn. This switch in direction is related to covariance vs. contravariance, and it also is related to how transposes flip multiplication: (AB)T = BTAT.  The geometric significance of the transpose is how it interacts with the dot product on Euclidean space. Writing <v,v'> for the dot product of two vectors v and v' in Euclidean space, for v in Rn and w in Rm check that <A(v),w> = <v,A^T(w)>.  So we can move a matrix to the other side of the dot product at the cost of replacing it with its transpose. Note the two dot products in that equation are not on the same space: the one on the left is the dot product on Rm while the one on the right is on Rn."

Imagine you're traveling to the UK (assuming you're not there already). The currency over there is the British Pound, while it's Euros in your country of origin, which we'll assume to be France. You carry some amount of Euros, say 500 Euros, and you know how much they're worth: given the amount of Euros, you can just multiply by 1.5 or whatever the exchange rate is. Thus we have a function € -> £ that turns Euros into Pounds.  But say you're at King's Cross and want to buy one of the overpriced sandwiches for £5 each. You take £20 out of your pocket and realise that you can buy 4 sandwiches. Just kidding, since you've just arrived with the Eurostar your pockets are full of Euros and what you're holding is 50 Euros. How many sandwiches can you buy these? Easy, convert them into pounds and go from there.  You've just used pullbacks. You have a function € -> £ (converting money) and a function £ -> N (how many of these darn sandwhiches you can afford). Thanks to your function € -> £ you can work directly: € -> N. What have you done? Simply, you just use your transition function to ""pull back"" the function on £ to a function on €. Now you're fed up with the rude customer service and go to McDonald's where you realise you can use the same concept to figure out how many portions of their fries you can afford.  Thus, whenever you have a function € -> £, you can pull back functions on £ to functions on €. If you have a certain amount of euros, you just convert them into pounds (this is the function € -> £) and there you go. That means your function € -> £ gives a function £* -> €* where the * denotes ""functions from £ into something, for example N"".   It turns out you're actually American (you probably are), so I've forgot to deal with dollars. You first have to convert $ to € for your France trip, which is a function $ -> €. Now knowing how many sandwiches or fries you can buy in Euros you can just calculate the amount given an amount of dollars, like the $50 dollar bill you forgot to exchange for something more useful. Convert them into Euros, then calculate. Of course you can also convert them into pounds directly.  That is, if you have a chain $ -> € -> £ of functions, naturally you get a chain £* -> €* -> $*. Note here the order has to reverse since you flip sources and targets. Thus, any version of ""functions on a space"" is fundamentally contravariant."

What you have will not create uniform integers because you have uniform reals in (0,2) and use round so have 25% chance of 1, 50% chance of 2, 25% chance of 3. If you want to get integers from reals use floor not round (ie floor(3*rand(1))+1), but better to use randi. I think this could explain the probabilities you are seeing not matching the theoretical 1/3, 2/3.  Just for fun heres a vectorised version:  Ngame = 500000;  % 3 doors game_door = randi(3,[Ngame 1]); player_first_choice = randi(3,[Ngame 1]);  stay_wins = sum(player_first_choice==game_door); disp(sprintf('Wins if STAY: %d ( %.2f%% )',stay_wins,100*stay_wins/Ngame))  % if you switch when your first choice was correct you lose % if you switch when your first choice was wrong then you win switch_wins = sum(player_first_choice~=game_door); disp(sprintf('Wins if SWITCH: %d ( %.2f%% )',switch_wins,100*switch_wins/Ngame))"

I always argued that opening 98 doors was not a generalization because in the 3-door case, they only opened ONE door. Thus, in the 100-door case, they should open ONE door."" Obviously, with the 3-door case, there is not enough contextual information to prove which generalization is correct: opening all but two doors or simply opening one extra door (although I see why everyone assumes the latter).  I like how this paper just starts with a generalization and THEN goes to the 3-door case.

math,3cggs8,feetandcum,8,Tue Jul 7 18:47:56 2015 UTC,"Great question!  There are (at least) two ways of smoothing out a singular curve.  You can normalize it, or deform it.  The genus of the normalization is the geometric genus, the genus of a flat deformation is the arithmetic genus.  For instance, let's consider the vanishing locus of [;y^2z-x^3.;]  This is a cuspidal cubic curve and so we have two conflicting notions of genus.  If we normalize, we get the projective line, which is smooth of genus 0.  On the other hand, we can deform the cusp in this family: [;y^2z-x(x-tz)(x+tz).;]  When t=1, we get the smooth genus 1 curve given by [;y^2z-x(x-z)(x+z);], so we see that the arithmetic genus is 1.  Hope that helps!"
math,3cggs8,laonious,3,Tue Jul 7 19:56:22 2015 UTC,"great answer. please, a little more on normalization.

I found your answer very enlightening."
math,3cggs8,electronp,3,Tue Jul 7 20:17:34 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you found it helpful!  There are two ways to go about normalization.  The first is to actually normalize by using the integral closure of the function rings.  For instance, locally, we can write the cusp as [;Spec\,k[x,y]/(y^2-x^3);].  The integral closure of [;k[x,y]/(y^2-x^3);] is isomorphic to [;k[t];].  So the normalization of that affine piece is the affine line.  The other approach is to blow up the singularities, which replaces each singularity with the projectivization of its normal cone, separating everything out.  The wikipedia article a good source."

math,3cggs8,SheafCobromology,3,Wed Jul 8 18:50:06 2015 UTC,"To answer some other bits of your question: for a smooth plane curve of degree d in P2 (which over C is the image of a compact Riemann surface over a holomorphic embedding), the arithmetic and geometric genus agree, and are computed by the formula g = (d-1)(d-2)/2. I'm guessing you know this already.  If the curve has a singularity, the geometric genus does not change (since the general plane curve is smooth, you can easily write down a one-parameter family of degree d curves whose general member is smooth but contains the singular curve of interest), but you decrease the arithmetic genus as computed above by a number called the delta invariant. Starting on p. 37, these notes explain the definition and computation fairly well: http://www.math.harvard.edu/~jbland/ma266y_notes.pdf  The basic idea is that a singular curve is only immersed, rather than embedded, so while any function, differential, vector field etc defined on the singular curve lifts to its normalization in an obvious way, the failure of an immersion to be an embedding can be measured quantitatively in terms of the compatibility conditions that a function-type-gadget must satisfy to descend. For example, a node is a point over which the map is 2-1, but still injective on the level of tangent spaces, so a function on the normalization will descend if it takes the same value on both points that map to the node. This is one condition, so the acquisition of a node causes the arithmetic genus of a curve to decrease by 1.  On the other hand, when you immerse a curve with a cusp, the map is set-theoretically injective, but the image of the differential at the singular point is trivial, so a function can take any value at the cusp, but must have vanishing derivative. Again one condition, again the genus decreases by one. In fact nodes and cusps are the only double points that plane curves can acquire, so the two kinds of singular cubics (both with genus 0 normalization) are those with a single node and those with a single cusp.  More complicated singularities tend to behave like a blend of these two basic cases."

math,3cf4sa,formathquestions,2,Tue Jul 7 12:45:59 2015 UTC,"In the Gaussian integers, the proved analogue of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions in Z is primes in angular sectors of the first quadrant. The density is theta/(pi/2), where theta is the angle of the sector. The point here is that angular sectors take up a positive proportion of the first quadrant, just as an arithmetic progression does among the positive integers (or a slight thickening of an arithmetic progression does in the reals that are greater than or equal to 1 if you measure density in a limiting sense as a subset of [1,N]as N --> infinity).   Vertical lines, even if thickened to vertical strips containing no further Gaussian integers, have density 0 in a limiting sense. Nobody knows at present how to prove the existence of infinitely many primes along a vertical line. As the OP /u/formathquestions points out in a comment,  the case N = 1 corresponds to prime numbers of the form a2 + 1, and it is a famous open question going back to Euler to show there are infinitely many such prime numbers.  Proving there is a Gaussian prime on a general vertical line appears to be just as difficult as proving there are infinitely many Gaussian primes on each such line. I am not saying there is a precise logical equivalence, but just conveying reality. The analogy with Dirichlet's theorem in Z is that there is no known way at present to prove a general arithmetic progression {x = c mod m} where (c,m) = 1 contains one prime without at the same time proving it contains infinitely many primes, and in that case the two results (one prime vs. infinitely many primes) are logically equivalent when we quantify over all relatively prime c and m. The OP even asks for a Gaussian prime in a limited range on a general vertical line, and the analogue of that in Z is Linnik's theorem, which is much harder than Dirichlet's theorem.   I checked numerically that among the first 1000 positive integers N, the number of a up to N that make N + ai prime in Z[i] looks like an erratically growing function of N that is 1 for the last time when N = 12, is 2 for the last time when N = 21, is 3 for the last time when N = 39, and so on. Probably what the OP is asking is true, but it looks hopeless to try to prove it with our present understanding."

He tried a test to narrow the area of specialty. He put each man in a room with a stove, a table, and a pot of water on the table. He said ""Boil the water"". Both men moved the pot from the table to the stove and turned on the burner to boil the water. Next, he put them into a room with a stove, a table, and a pot of water on the floor. Again, he said ""Boil the water"". The first man put the pot on the stove and turned on the burner. The counselor told him to be an Engineer, because he could solve each problem individually. The second man moved the pot from the floor to the table, and then moved the pot from the table to the stove and turned on the burner. The counselor told him to be a mathematician because he reduced the problem to a previously solved problem.  So the mathematician abstracted the problem, which was more work in a way, but he has a more general solution now, which is what is desired in math!"

Now it makes sense why we're supposed to spend a lot of time understanding what problems have already been solved.   And abstracting the problem and working out a general solution makes it possible to apply the general solution to other similar problems. Abstraction is important because, I guess, the form of the question is more important than the details. Maybe that means that there is a set of solutions and that satisfy all problems. Mathematicians are trying to complete that set. Hmm. That's cool. Seems like a big undertaking. But important nonetheless.

With that formulation I can imagine homer's location as an artifact of how we phrased the question.

This might be optimal but the proof is beyond me. All I know is it makes a rectangular prism with square ends using all the wood, and makes a cube with the aforementioned 2/3rds rectangle.  Edit: my solution is definitely not optimal, a ratio of 1/6th could make a cube with more volume than my method. Still it might be the best way to use all the wood without a headache, and gives you aesthetically pleasant squares as endpieces.   Edit 2: For a ratio below 1/6th you can chop off two squares the length of the short side and quarter the remaining length to obtain a similar square ended rectangular prism.

math,3cdrn3,imnzerg,3,Wed Jul 8 03:14:35 2015 UTC,"After sitting here thinking about it, one can argue to oneself that there are too many degrees of freedom on the cuts to be made to guarantee the uniqueness of a maximizer, (at least one certainly exists from a usual compactness argument)   Now the question then is do we expect a unique maximizer up to rotating or moving the box (in math jargon we really mean up to isotopy).   Lets consider a sheet of area A = wh, where w is the width of the sheet, and h is the height. Now generically cutting the sheet into 6 pieces will not result in a structure that will be able to form a rectangular prism.   The rectangular prism will be made up of 6 different pieces, but there are only really 3 pairs of pieces, with area A_1 = w_1h_1, A_2 = w_2h_2 and A_3 = w_3h_3, where w_i and h_i$ are the heights and widths of the various pieces for i = 1,2,3.  Now we then have the given constraints: We want that 2(A_1 + A_2 + A_3) = 2(w_1h_1 + w_2h_2 + w_3h_3) = A, which remember is our fixed value.  So far we are trying then to opitmize 1 equation with 6 independent variables with one constraint; however we know that there are other constraints.  Now we need to ask ourselves, does where we cut matter, assuming we are cutting six rectangles, 3 pairs of to identical rectangles? Absolutely, the first cut cannot be randomly placed on the board, since it may preclude the other cuts from being possible. So then how do we mathematically encode the fact that generic cuts are not permissible, but others are? This is exactly what is hard about the problem. This constraint itself depends on the dimensions of the initial sheet, which are themselves unknown. Not only that, but it does not behave in a well behaved manner: Small perturbations of the initial dimensions dramatically alter where the permissible cuts exist on the sheet of wood.  Tl;dr Too many free variables and violent (likely non-continuous) dependence of the constraint on the unknown dimensions of the wood sheet make this problem likely unsolvable in this general setting."

math,3cfo3x,mathhead,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:58:09 2015 UTC,"My intuitive approach to thinking about Beta is ""a general distribution over the unit interval (0,1) in the form of powers of x"" kinda like a polynomial. Look at the form of the PDF.  To fit between 0 and 1, you take xa and (1-x)b. Multiply them together and you get a polynomial-ish function that is strictly positive on (0,1) and zero at x=0 and x=1. Re-scale that function by dividing out the area under the curve. That is where the nasty Beta denominator comes in.  Now you have a general smooth curve on (0, 1) with area 1, so its a PDF. If the values of a and b are integers, not only is your function in the form of powers of X, it's a polynomial! Not just polynomial-ish.   So if you have data that apparently take on values between 0 and 1 in a more or less continuous way, a Beta distribution can be found that does a decent job of matching the data."

math,3ccz62,GetOffMyLawn_,9,Tue Jul 7 00:07:39 2015 UTC,"What did you envision for yourself when you decided on this degree? I would say there is not a hell of a lot for simply a bachelor's degree or for a math degree just by itself. If you wanted to be an actuary you have to get thru the exams. You might find work as a statistician, although a master's would be better. Even teaching positions require a master's these days, if not when you're hired then it must be completed within a certain amount of time. Financial institutions might be interested, but I think most quants have at least a master's.   Getting into IT is a bit difficult without some basic knowledge or certification. You can take a diploma program at a trade school or community college. You can try getting some professional certs. We would hire vocational school grads without degrees and make them take training courses and get certs. If they wanted to advance in the company then they got a degree or two on the side.  Getting your first job is a bitch, period. Everyone wants someone with experience, and of course as a fresh out you have none. I forget how many months it took me to get that first job, and it was a real sucky job at that. But I lucked into IT back in the early days (1980) when there were no almost no IT degrees, no training, nada. Being able to think logically was good enough.   I would say that before you enroll in any computer classes take a good look at a lot of job listings and see what IT skills they're looking for. Do they want Java or C++ or Python? (Or maybe all three!) Do they care about the platform? Do they want you to have familiarity with certain tools (you mentioned Matlab, there are a whole host of things it helps to know, including some basic office suite tools).   Check out openings with the federal government: http://study.com/articles/Jobs_and_Salary_Info_for_a_Bachelors_Degree_in_Mathematics.html  http://www.indeed.com/q-Mathematics-jobs.html  How to become a quant https://www.quantstart.com/a-step-by-step-guide-on-getting-a-job-for-quantitative-analysts#undergraduate  Your first job may be horrible, but I think it pays to hold out until you find something in or near your field, otherwise you may be typecast, or stuck in a nowhere job. Once you've been there 6 months to a year you will be vastly more attractive to potential employers.  Another thought is, do you have good writing skills? You might find a technical writing position, if only as a temporary position while you pursue something more in line with your education. In a department of 25 people I was the only one who could write good documentation, and I wrote shitloads. I liked it.  Or you can follow the time honored tradition of going to graduate school."

Let Pn be the probability of his last name surviving forever, given n male progeny in the current generation. We aim to find P1.  P1 = 1/4 * P0 + 1/2 * P1 + 1/4 * P2. Since P0 = 0, we have P1 = 1/2 * P2.  But P2 is the odds of success given two male progeny, which is simply the odds of at least one success among two independent chances, each with probability P1. If P1 is nonzero, then P2 must be less than 2 * P1, since in some cases both progeny would succeed. But this contradicts P1 = 1/2 * P2. So P1 is zero.  In more detail: P2 = 1 - (1 - P1)2 = 1 - (1 - 1/2 * P2)2 = 1 - 1 + P2 - P22 / 4. That is, we have 0 = P22 / 4, and hence P2 and P1 are zero."

math,3chuev,functor7,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:24:56 2015 UTC,"It's a good video, but the math people here have trouble understanding what it's saying. The main idea is that infinite series are not a uniquely defined object. If we have an infinite sequence of rational numbers (a,b,c,...), then there are many procedures that we can use to assign a value to this sequence that can meaningfully be interpreted as a+b+c+...  One way to do this is to view them as real numbers, and this comes with the extra baggage of a geometry. We can then use this geometry to assign the value of a+b+c+... to be the limit under this geometry of the partial sums a, a+b, a+b+c,... (if it exists). This is the typical one that we're familiar with.   Another way that we can do this is view the rational numbers a,b,c,... as p-adic Numbers. Each system of p-adic numbers comes with it's own geometry and so it's own version of a limit. We can then assign to a+b+c+... to be the limit of the partial sums in p-adic numbers. In this way, sequences like 1+2+4+8+16+... converge to -1 in the 2-adic numbers.  There are, of course, other methods. We can find a function f(x) that formally equals the sum of a+b+c+... at some value x=T, even if this sum diverges. Then assign the value f(T) to this series. This is how 1+2+3+...=-1/12.  But the moral is that the sums of partial sequences in the reals is not some super special, all definitive way to assign a value to an infinite sum. It is only one of infinitely many. So the notation a+b+c+... is ambiguous to begin with, not equal to anything until I choose a way to assign a value to it. But your choice is not better than mine. None of these choices are canonical.  But we can ask: ""If I find a way to meaningfully assign a value to the sequence (a,b,c,...) of rational numbers, what value does this have to be?"" This is the question that Numberphile answers. If we can find a method to assign values to the sum 1+2+3+..., then this value has to be -1/12. People don't like this, because they're too fixated on the real limit of partial sums as somehow being the ""best"" way to assign numbers.   I live in a 3-adic world, and there the sum 1+1/3+1/9+... diverges! So people really should first qualify that they're using the real limit before saying that 1+1/3+1/9+...=3/2, because I automatically see it as divergent."
math,3chuev,CosmicEmpanada,3,Wed Jul 8 03:09:55 2015 UTC,"Except that there is none of that explanation/motivation you just gave in the video! It's just a guy doing algebraic manipulations on different series, until he gets the result.   I don't disagree with the non-uniqueness of possible values for an infinite series, I just disagree with presenting it in a completely unmotivated way, as Numberphile did there. If they want to expose people to math, they shouldn't do it in a way that makes it seem like just a magic trick, especially since it can be explained in a way that makes it actually make sense (you just did)."
math,3chuev,functor7,2,Wed Jul 8 03:44:06 2015 UTC,"It's fine to play with divergent series, as long as you're careful how you treat the values assigned. The reason why we say 1+2+3+4+... =-1/12 is for a lot of different reasons of varying formality.  If you want to assign a value to something like 1+sqrt(2)+sqrt(3)+... then you have to have a good reason, even if your proof isn't particularly formal. The way your assigning values doesn't really make sense.   If you're going to assign a value to your sum it should be about -.20789."

The reason why the sum of all natural numbers is said to be -1/12 is because there is something behind the scenes going on with something called the Zeta function, like /u/functor7 said, and actually the sum of all natural numbers is clearly not -1/12. I dont want to discourage you from playing around with divergent series, its actually quite fun, and playing around with series is like sudoku to me.

Many times some theorem has been proved assuming GRH is true and later someone comes along and proves the theorem in an unconditional way (making no use whatsoever of GRH or other unproved conjectures). The reality is that GRH has always been a valid guide to what should be true, so when someone proves a result conditional on it you should think ""OK, this is how matters should really go"" and this might inspire you to find a different proof that bypasses an assumption like GRH.

math,3cdcf1,bananasluggers,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:16:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like the proof given there actually does a good job of giving an intuitive justification. If you can view max as union and min as intersection, then it becomes pretty obvious.  Here's an attempt at a more direct justification:   I'm going to define the symbol Σ[k](S) to be the ""sum of the minumums of the cardinality k subsets of S"", i.e. the sum of min(K), over all possible subsets K of S with cardinality of k.  So the claim is: max(S) = Σ[1](S) - Σ[2](S) + Σ[3](S) - ... +- Σ[|S|](S)  Let m be a maximal element in S and let N be the set S minus the set {m}.  The key feature here is: then Σ[k](S) = Σ[k-1](N) + Σ[k](N).  The reasoning here is that you are separating the subsets of S of size k into two groups: those that contain m and those that don't. If one of these sets do contain m, then when you take the min, you don't need worry about m -- you might as well just consider other might as well not include m -- just take the min of the k-1 elements in N.   Let's derive the formula for max(S). Start with Σ[1](S). This overcounts by exactly Σ[1](N).  So we subtract Σ[2](S) = Σ[1](N) + Σ[2](N). We've subtracted too much though, we subtracted exactly Σ[2](N) too much.  So add on Σ[3](S) = Σ[2](N)+Σ[3](N). We've added on too much....  This keeps going until we get to Σ[#S](S), but Σ[#S](S) = min(S) = min(N) = Σ[#S-1](N)  You don't need to add on Σ[#S](N) this time because there are no subsets of N of size #S. So you didn't over count on this last time around.  summary when you take minimums of sets, you can 'throw out' the maximal element from consideration. This gives you a way to do a telescoping sum."

math,3cexkt,jeanandre,7,Tue Jul 7 11:26:12 2015 UTC,"Yes!  First and foremost, please make sure that your existing code is actually taking advantage of the sparse structure.  Your matrix isn't strictly band-limited from what you say, but reasonably fast direct inverses are still possible through re-ordering techniques that limit bandwidth.  If you're doing this in a language like MATLAB, then the work is done for you already if you define your matrices as sparse(A) and such.  In C or Fortran, take a look at suitesparse.  (Edit to add: I see it's not technically sparse, see below)  If you're already doing this and it's still too slow, then you should begin looking at iterative methods.  These won't give you an exact solution, but they will give you an answer to A-1 b to within a user-specified error tolerance.  The workhorse here are Krylov subspace methods, the most general of which is GMRES -- appropriate if your matrix is non-symmetric.  Now, GMRES by itself is probably going to be too slow for you, but that's where preconditioning comes in.  A preconditioner acts as a very rough and simple-to-compute approximation to A-1, such that at each step the iterative method has a more well-behaved system to solve (a wee bit more formally: the eigenvalues of AP, where P is the preconditioner, should cluster much more strongly near 1 than do the eigenvalues of A alone).  The goal of a preconditioner isn't to solve the system, it's to get the iteration to converge in 10 or 50 iterations rather than 1000 or 50000.  Choosing a proper preconditioner is something of an art.  Given your description of the problem, you might be able to get somewhere with a preconditioner based on the (inverse of) only the main, significant diagonals, ignoring small terms and the off-diagonal elements.  This may be of particular benefit to you since your matrix sounds as if it would be sparse if you applied a significance threshold.  Essentially, this sort of preconditioner would be a type of numerical perturbation method, where the preconditioner handles the strong interaction and the iterative method takes care of the ε terms.  Another ""naïve"" choice is an incomplete LU factorization of the matrix A, which works by computing an LU factorization (natch) but dropping elements according to some criteria -- two popular choices are to drop elements below a threshold and to preserve the original structure.    Finally, your approach might benefit from a multigrid preconditioner, which in an intuitive nutshell says ""the best guess for my candidate solution is what I'd get by solving this at a lower resolution,"" plus some high-resolution smoothing.  Multigrid methods are powerful and beautiful, but especially for unstructured meshes (which it seems that you may have?) they're not trivial to set up.  Trottenberg's Multigrid is the best textbook I've ever seen on the approach; if you're at a university you may be able to get it from the library.  A ""black box"" multigrid approach can also sometimes work in the form of algebraic multigrid (explained a bit in the textbook above), which operates on your matrix directly rather than on the underlying physical or geometrical basis.  I have a bit less experience with this, so I'll refrain from otherwise commenting.  Multigrid methods in and of themselves can act as iterative solvers.  I prefer using them as preconditioners to something like GMRES, however, since the belt-and-suspenders combination is a bit more robust."
math,3cexkt,Majromax,2,Tue Jul 7 13:02:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the extensive response! Based on what you've written, it looks like GMRES with preconditioning looks like the way to go.   I am working with MATLAB, however the sparse function itself doesn't help me very much. Do you know of any already defined pre-conditioners/solvers in matlab?"
math,3cexkt,Majromax,3,Tue Jul 7 13:40:30 2015 UTC,"sparse itself won't help if your matrix is ""really"" a full matrix, which you seem to suggest in your main text.  As a first stab at it, I'd try defining a preconditioner based on sparse(A(A > <threshold>)), with some suitably-chosen threshold to eliminate most of the off-diagonal entries.  That thresholded matrix would then be passed directly to gmres as a preconditioner, since Matlab's implementation computes P \ r (doing the back-substitution).  You can tell if the preconditioner is doing a decent job if the number of iterations necessary to reach your tolerance drops by a significant factor.   (You can tell a bit more rigorously by looking at the eigenvalues of A*(P-1) -- doing so can make a really pretty figure for a research paper or thesis.  ""These are your eigenvalues.  These are your eigenvalues on drugs a preconditioner.  Any questions?"")  If this is looking like a useful candidate, then you can compute the sparse-friendly factorization through the more advanced incarnations of lu -- check the options with multiple outputs.  If I remember correctly, you want the one that goes [L, U, P, Q, R] = lu(A) for sparse A.  This way, you can compute the factorization once at setup-time rather than once per call to gmres -- it will give you the same number-of-iterations performance but will be computationally faster.  If you'd prefer to try incomplete LU factorization, look at MATLAB's ilu function.  It's worth trying both of these before moving to a more complicated preconditioner, since your interest is obviously in solving the problem rather than doing research work on numerical methods."

math,3cd0sd,lakelandman,28,Mon Jul 6 23:24:12 2015 UTC,"Every operation in a trivial sense is as it is because it is defined to be that way. For example, we could have said the word multiplication defined the function that is identical to actual multiplication except 2 * 3 = 5 and that would be fine -- but it wouldn't be very useful or interesting. We would probably then have another word for actual multiplication, and we would talk about that function a lot more.  Often, the reason we define things the way we do is because it makes patterns work. With multiplication, we have a pattern called the distributive property that a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c, and that pattern is really important. So when we choose the value of 2 * 3, we should make it the value of (1 + 1) * 3 = 3 + 3 = 6.  With ex, we also have patterns. For example, we have the pattern that ex = Sum_n xn/n!. We have the pattern that d/dx ex = ex and the corresponding fact that, due to the chain rule, d/dx eax = aeax.  Either of these facts, and others too, will lead to eipi = -1."

Euler's formula is what we find to be true if we assume analysis on complex numbers works analogously to that of real numbers.  For instance, the differential equation y'' = -y. According to our theory of differential equations this has two linearly independent solutions. With real numbers the conventional choice of linearly independent solutions is y1(t) =sin(t) and y2(t) = cos(t). If we add complex numbers to the mix and assume everything works just the same way, treating i as just another constant, then we also find y3(t) = exp(i*t) and y4(t) = exp(-i*t) are also solutions. But if there's two linearly independent solutions then exp(i*t) must be some linear combination of sin(t), cos(t). Plugging in some values of t nails it down.  No definitions involved. Just the assumption we can extend the existing rules to handle complex numbers.  Edit: when you say you were reading a complex analysis book that defined exp(i*x) it may be that particular book took a pedagogical approach that made it more convenient to simply define that. But the mathematics itself makes that choice the obvious one, not human invention."

The function 4z, however, is a well-defined single-valued analytic function on C. When we plug in z=1/2, we get 2.  We have the same problem for other exponents, but if the exponent isn't rational, we get infinitely many values. The function zi pi is infinitely valued. For any z, the outputs we get are exp(i pi log(z)) for all of the different choices of log(z), which all differ by multiples of 2*pi*i.

So far, this makes sense for all real x, but it is not defined for complex numbers. It turns out that this function has a unique analytic extension, meaning that there is only one way to extend it to the complex numbers such that the function is holomorphic (holomorphic functions are complex differentiable).   This is why the power series ""proof"" for the equation works the way it does. Plugging ipi into the Taylor series of ex doesn't prove that epi*i actually equals -1, but rather that the ""analytic extension"" of f(x)=ex happens to be such that f(i*pi)=-1.

math,3cd0sd,EulerLime,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:23:52 2015 UTC,"I think I can try and address what you're driving at. The question you are implying is 'why is the base of the exponential function what it is, 2.71...?' The answer lies in what we use the exponential function for. It turns out that this number allows the derivative of the exponential function to be equal to the exponential function. We want this because it satisfies very important differential equations. In other words, the function defines e, e does not define the function.   If you've taken a course in differential equations you will understand that the solutions to equations involving harmonic motion are sines and cosines. These functions, too, can be thought of as arising from certain conditions imposed on them. You can differentiate either of them and wind up with the other, and you will eventually wind up back where you started. In much the same way as the exponential, these characteristics define sine and cosine. These functions were 'created' to serve a purpose.  There are ways to prove that the exponential function and sine and cosine are related, but it's a lot more elegant (in my opinion) to realize that they both arise from differential equations, approximating (or representing) the natural world. That deep connection allows for Euler's identity, trig identities, ect."

You can see this action as the matrix ((i,k),(0,1)) acting on the vector (j,1). If I did these calculations right, this should be the semi-direct product of Z/3Z by Z/2Z and should give all the possible ways to permute the three objects  21/3, w21/3 and w221/3.   While, morally, it's kinda the same as switching pluses and minuses but with cube roots of unity rather than 2-roots of unity, it's a much more sophisticated transformation. But generally, switching around the roots of unity is how any solvable extension should behave (I'm guessing). This will definitely be the case for abelian extensions, as they inherit their actions from the cyclotomic fields.

Lets look at an example that has less options. Say you have 3 books on a shelf, and you want to know the possible ways you can arrange those books.  Well, you have 3 'slots' and so your first slot, you have 3 books you can pick from, the second slot you only have two books to pick from, and the last slot would only have 1 book left. Then, what you do is take all your possible combinations for your books and multiply them together (3 * 2 * 1) = 3!=6.   Brute force of the all possible ways: ABC ACB BAC BCA CAB CBA  Now, back to your original question. 52 cards in a deck, means that for the top card, there's 52 options, the second from the top has only 51 options (because there's one in the top already) third from top has 50 options... etc all the way down to the bottom card which would have the only card left.

It might help to think about it as each of the 5s ""pairing up"" with a 2 to form a factor of 10, which then survives into the final product because multiplying 10 by an integer won't decrease the number of zeroes at the end.

The method uses time slices, and all frequencies detected are harmonics of the frequency that is exactly the length of the slice (which is ""arbitrary"", though in practice the number of samples in the slice is usually a power of 2).  This all works out anyway, because any given signal can be broken down in many ways without loss of information, but someone looking to analyze the actual fundamental frequencies in a recording will be severely disappointed by the raw spectrum data returned by standard analysis methods.

Specifically I didn't like the factorials you get in the formula; to me at the time, my thoughts were that factorials were in a sense ""special"", and their presence would be something more than just ""the numbers that make it work"".   A few days later, I was driving home. I nearly crashed when my mind decided to announce to itself ""Those factorials are undoing the multiplications that differentiation does"".   That's my favourite (as it's my best) click story. It came out of nowhere; it just happened. And that's often the case.. A few weeks ago as I was going to sleep, I had an idea for a correspondence which gave an isomorphism I needed. I like how it feels when it comes from nowhere. I dislike the complete lack of control.  There are some thing that help me a lot to understand mathematics, though.    Try and explain it to someone else. This is such a good way of finding where the holes in your knowledge are; either you can't explain it properly or they'll question what you've said, which might force you to think harder. Sometimes things don't click because it's not going to - the more basic facts might need a jiggling in your mind first so they're really correct. If you have no one to talk to... talk to a rubber duck (google rubber duck debugging!).  Do concrete examples. Working through an instance of something otherwise abstract is awesome for illuminating what is going on. It's worth the effort.  Read around the idea. Maths is so connected, it's near on impossible to find an idea that can only be viewed in exactly one way. Other perspectives and/or connections are sometimes what you need. (A particularly good example from my experience, the way physicists talk about tensors confused me no end. Then I learnt about tensor algebras from a strictly algebraic point of view, found them much easier, and then translating that into physics-speak was a lot less pain for me).   Those three are what I do the most.. they generally help, but I do still have many mathematical struggles!   Remember, humans have literally the best amount of intelligence. We have enough to be able to do mathematics and find it challenging and beautiful. We are not so dumb it's completely confounding, and not so smart that it's all trivial.

math,3c86uo,WiggleBooks,13,Mon Jul 6 00:49:33 2015 UTC,"What ultimately made me double major was that instead of feeling overjoyed at finishing the engineering math prerequisites, I felt disappointed. I didn't want to leave the ME program, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd deeply regret not taking more math classes. The following semester I took Discrete Math to test the waters, and that's when I realized that pure math in particular is what I really love. I managed to graduate with both majors after 5 years total, so it didn't put me too far behind. It definitely wasn't easy though--there were times when it made my life a living hell--but now that it's all said and done, I regret nothing.  Currently, I'm working as a mechanical engineer. My goal for now is to take a break from school (before eventually going back for a graduate degree), get some work experience, save some money, and pursue my hobbies. On that note, I still like to practice and read about mathematics, but only on a hobbyist level for now.  On one hand, my background in math is too theoretical to directly help me as an engineer, at least in the sense that I could be (for example) completely oblivious to the axioms of Set Theory and still do my job competently. On the other hand, my pure math classes did far more to develop my problem solving skills in general than even my engineering classes, which made the upper division engineering classes a lot easier to swallow. Regarding getting a job, I think that the math major is roughly as helpful as your ability to market it--employers probably won't care unless you tell them why they should care.   I'd say that if you love math enough to do the extra work, and if you don't mind the thought of delaying your graduation slightly, you should definitely look into doing a double major."
math,3c86uo,etherteeth,2,Mon Jul 6 01:37:00 2015 UTC,I'm considering doing the exact same thing and dual majoring. How do you best market the math major?
math,3c86uo,asdf007tkdasdf,4,Mon Jul 6 02:16:17 2015 UTC,"First of all, an interesting way to market a pure math double major in an interview for an engineering position is to frame the discussion in a way that highlights the similarities between math and engineering.   The first step in an engineering project is to understand the problem and the requirements of an effective solution. Likewise, when proving a mathematical theorem, the first step is to understand what the theorem means and what needs to be done to prove it.   The second step in an engineering project is to develop and evaluate solution concepts that meet the problem's requirements. In math, this step is analogous to brainstorming ideas for an argument or construction which seems to solve the problem.   After a concept is selected, the next step in an engineering project is to build a prototype of the concept. Finally, this prototype is tested to ensure that it actually does meet the project's requirements. In mathematics, the analogous step is to develop the rigorous details of your construction/argument, then prove that it actually works.   In this context, problems in engineering and pure math seem to follow the same solution process. That means that having a math double major is beneficial for engineering because it gives you even more practice with this solution process. Furthermore, developing this skill in the abstract context of mathematics makes it easier to apply to a wider range of topics."

From there, one might try plugging in or something else to try to actually determine its truth.   That could very well be. I had a different interpretation. The OP was talking about 'plugging in' though, so rather than posing a 'maybe equality' I would suggest that the OP write something like ""check if ... is a solution to ...""

math,3c86uo,G-Brain,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:12:59 2015 UTC,"About rearranging, you'd do less work by not rearranging: when you plug in, you have to evaluate LHS and RHS no matter what (or you have to simplify, which will go the same way whether it's solved for 0 or not). In your way, you then subtract and see if it's zero. If you never moved anything, you'd just check if they're equal.  Also, I don't see how LHS-RHS=0 expresses ambiguity or 'maybe equal to'.

This is why a lot of linear algebra courses, while they might mention quotient spaces, do not stress them.  However, not only is the conceptual usefulness of quotient vector spaces great, but the idea to understand them is exactly the same as is required to understand quotients of modules over rings, and this is something that cannot be avoided if you want to understand modules.  Since you know about quotients of groups and quotients of rings, quotients of vector spaces are very similar and should be easy.  Like quotients of rings by ideals, the construction proceeds by taking the quotient of the space viewed as an abelian group, and the only extra bit is showing that the quotient is actually a vector space, i.e., that you can still multiply by scalars.    So is it worth studying quotient spaces and the above link?  Definitely!  If you were only taking a linear algebra course because you were an engineer or CS person, it probably wouldn't be worth your time, but for anybody planning on going further with math, there are important ideas in the proof, and you will likely see the proof again when you learn about Lie algebras."

math,3c8uo6,you-get-an-upvote,16,Sun Jul 5 23:59:37 2015 UTC,"First I will discuss the case when the modulus is a power of 2 and then the case when the modulus is not a power of 2.  Case 1: modulus is a power of 2. A triangular number is of the form (x2 + x)/2.  Suppose for a positive integer n that (x2 + x)/2 = (y2 + y)/2 mod 2n with x and y lying between 0 and 2n - 1.  We want to show x = y.    Multiplying through the congruence by 2 we get x2 + x = y2 + y mod 2n+1, which is equivalent to (x-y)(x+y+1) = 0 mod 2n+1. Since x-y and x+y+1 are of opposite parity, one of them is even and one of them is odd, so the even one is automatically divisible by 2n+1.  If x - y is divisible by 2n+1 then x = y mod 2n+1, and hence x = y mod 2n, so x = y since they lie between 0 and 2n - 1. Could x+y+1 be divisible by 2n+1? Since x and y range from 0 to 2n - 1, x+y+1 ranges from 1 to 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 2n+1 -1, so x+y+1 is not a multiple of 2n+1.  Case 2: modulus is not a power of 2. Calling the modulus m, we will show the reduced triangular numbers k(k+1)/2 mod m for k = 0, 1, ..., m-1 will always have a repetition.    Specifically, we will show there is an integer k from 1 to m-1 at which k(k+1)/2 = 0 mod m, so the value of x(x+1)/2 mod m at x = 0 and at x = k coincide. To find such an integer k we will use the Chinese remainder theorem.    Write m = 2em', where e is a nonnegative integer and m' is odd with m' > 1. (The case m' = 1 corresponds to m being a power of 2, which is the case treated previously.) By the Chinese remainder theorem there is an integer a such that a = 0 mod 2e+1 and a = -1 mod m'.  This integer is uniquely determined modulo 2e+1 m' = 2m, so there is such an a in the range from 0 to 2m-1, and definitely a is not 0 since a is not divisible by m' (here we use that m' > 1, so this is the step where m not being a power of 2 plays an essential role). Thus a lies in the range from 1 to 2m-1. Since a is divisible by 2e+1 and a+1 is divisible by m', the product a(a+1) is divisible by 2e+1m' = 2m, so a(a+1)/2 is divisible by m.  If a is in the range from 1 to m-1 then we can use k = a and we are done.  What if a is in the range from m to 2m-1? In this case set b := 2m - 1 - a, so b = -1 mod 2e+1 and b = 0 mod m'.  These are the ""flipped"" congruences compared to those on a. Now b is divisible by m' and b+1 is divisible by 2e+1, so b(b+1)/2 is divisible by m. Since a is from m to 2m-1, b is from 0 to m-1.  As long as b is not 0 we can use k = b. And indeed b is not 0, since the congruence b = -1 mod 2e+1 means b is odd.  Remark: I did not come up with the argument in case 2 by pure thought.  I looked at data when m is odd, twice an odd number, 4 times an odd number, and 8 times an odd number.  Most of the time I found there was exactly one nonzero k from 1 to m-1 at which k(k+1)/2 = 0 mod m, and by creating formulas for such k (depending on the power of 2 dividing m) I saw how k mod 2e+1 and k mod m' were important, which suggested the use of the Chinese remainder theorem to avoid horrific formulas."

I'm about to go to sleep so I don't have time to write a full answer to this, but, yes, there is a general rule that tells you the period of the sequence (n choose k) modulo pr.  (The triangular numbers of course being the case k=2.)  Specifically -- if I'm remembering this right, it's been a while -- the period is equal to pr times the largest power of p that is at most k.  (You may want to check that.)  For more general moduli you can apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  I don't know where you'd look this up; I assume it's well-known but I proved it for myself.  (Well, with some other people.)  I don't remember the details but it basically came down to applying Vandermonde's identity.  Your problem is obviously closely related but not quite exactly the same.  Still, I expect Vandermonde's identity will get you a long way towards a solution."
math,3c8uo6,Sniffnoy,2,Mon Jul 6 07:22:42 2015 UTC,"The problem with periodicity is that it does not control injectivity in the desired direction. If you know a sequence mod m has period m it does not force the sequence to have m distinct values, e.g., the repeating sequence 1, 1, 0 mod 3 has period 3 but does not take 3 different values.  Your recollection about a period for a binomial coefficient sequence modulo pr is correct. See pp. 228-229 in Alain Robert's p-adics textbook. But I do not know if it is always the minimal period. This formula shows the sequence of triangular numbers mod 2n has period 2n+1 and that does not directly show the first 2n triangular numbers reduced mod 2n are distinct."
math,3ca10v,Meemo16,21,Mon Jul 6 07:17:42 2015 UTC,Yes. Every prime factorisation is unique. If an integer had a prime factor which was not part of its prime factorisation then this uniqueness would be broken.

math,3ca10v,Quismat,3,Mon Jul 6 09:09:20 2015 UTC,An element p of a commutative ring is prime iff it generates a non-zero prime ideal. It gives us the divisibility properties of prime numbers without their irreducibility. In a UFD (or just an integral domain) they are necessarily irreducible though.
math,3ca10v,tsehable,3,Mon Jul 6 09:19:39 2015 UTC,Is the commutativity requirement really relevant? Single-generator subrings are always commutative unless I'm missing something.
math,3ca10v,Quismat,2,Mon Jul 6 09:28:35 2015 UTC,Honestly I included it just in case. Thinking more about it though it depends on what definition of prime ideal you're using. The standard elementwise definition requires commutativity but a quick search tells me Cohn has published some papers on non-commutative UFDs. They seem to take a different approach to primeness though.  The problem I think is that factorisation properties seem hard to translate to the non-commutative case.

For finite dimensional vector spaces, all norms are equivalent. A consequence is that you don't have to care (too much) about the topology of your vector space. In the infinite dimensional you do have to care (cf L1, L2, Lp, L\infty norms).    For the finite dimensional case, linear functions are automatically bounded. In the infinite dimensional case, this doesn't happen and therefore emphasis is often placed on bounded linear operators."

math,3c9rpo,Freact,5,Mon Jul 6 05:20:01 2015 UTC,"A good start would be just tracking how many of each number you roll (e.g. 1 six, 2 fives, etc), since that's relatively easy to track and a reasonable proxy for other (more precise) measures.  At a more sophisticated level, there are only a handful of ""types"" of battle roll (3 attackers vs 2 defenders, 2 attackers vs 2 defenders, 2 attackers vs 1 defender, etc).  If you track each turn of combat by tracking which side of the fight he was on (attacker or defender) and what the outcome of the roll was (attacker lose 2, each lose 1, defender lose 1, ...) you would have pretty complete battle statistics.  Since the distribution of outcomes for each type of battle are easily computed (and also available online) it's pretty easy to see whether somebody is losing a disproportionate number of battles of a particular type (e.g. ""when i'm defending with 2 against 3, i'm losing 2 guys 20% more often than I should!""), and looking across all the types should show you whether there's a systematic bias or not (if you're using fair dice, probably not)."
math,3c9rpo,trickyben2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:38:45 2015 UTC,"Yes! This is what I wanted. Thank you!  Okay one follow up question though: (I haven't thought too deeply about this yet, but maybe you can just give me the answer :P)  I'm prepared to put the work into making the sophisticated method work but I would really like to combine it all into one single measure. So for example as the defender in 1d6 vs 1d6 you've won 60% of battles where you were expected to win 58% and in 1d6 vs 2d6 you've won 41% where you were expected to win 42%. Basically, can I add or average or multiply the differences? Which of these is meaningful? It's been too long since I've taken any statistics."
math,3c9rpo,trickyben2,2,Mon Jul 6 07:32:02 2015 UTC,"The statistically valid way to analyze each battle statistic bin independently would be to do a statistical hypothesis test (such as the z-test) to determine whether the difference between the measured rate and the known (expected) rate was statistically significant. Unfortunately because you're testing on multiple bins simultaneously you run into the multiple comparisons effect, that is, by looking at several bins simultaneously for a significant difference, you're more likely to find a spurious relationship unless you account for the multiple comparisons, so you must apply a correction to each test.  If this was a serious research project that's more or less how I'd summarize it into a single thing - not by adding or multiplying the differences or trying to aggregate the percentages from different bins, but by doing a hypothesis test on each bin comparing the measured mean loss rate against the known fair loss rate and checking for significance (and accounting for multiple comparisons so that a significant difference in each bin can be considered meaningful).  That is, your final result is a yes/no ""did my results differ significantly from what I expected"" rather than a percentage.  edit: since a final result being a ""yes/no"" on whether the person rolled well isn't very ""fun"", a slightly sexier summary statistic (though not as formally valid) could be computed by finding the rate difference for each bin (e.g. I on average lose 1.2 guys per attack in this bin, when I would expect to lose 1.3, so my rate difference is 1.3-1.2 = 0.1) then doing a weighted sum of the rate differences (e.g. 90% of my battles were type A, 5% type B, and 5% type C, so final score=0.9*(rate diff of type A)+0.05*(rate diff of type B) +0.05*(rate diff of type C).  A large positive number would mean you're winning more than you should, a large negative would mean losing more than you should, and about zero would mean ""pretty much what you'd expect"".  The problem with this is you are adding unlike quantities (a rate difference of 0.1 is proportionally much larger in battles with an expected rate of 1 than battles with an expected rate of 2) so you lose some meaningful contextual information.  This is why my first suggestion was to do the final analysis at the per-bin level, then aggregate the analysis results, rather than trying to aggregate the results BEFORE analysis."
math,3c9rpo,trickyben2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:49:31 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks again for another great answer!  So I've done all the programming to calculate the probabilities of the different bins now. I'm still trying to decide the best way to finish this though. I'm very tempted to go with your ""sexier summary statistic"" idea as it's so much easier but I do like me some mathematical rigor.   Also, I was thinking: using a statistical hypothesis test would basically give me ""at what confidence level I could reject the hypothesis that the rolls are random"". I could just take the lowest of those from all the bins and give that as the output. This seems formally valid AND should give a nice range of numbers to look at.  Anyways, I have more questions if you have more answers:  1: I shouldn't actually do a Z-Test right? Z-Test is for a Normal distribution; dice rolls are not a normal distribution. Probably something more like Bernoulli... (I'll have to think about that)  2: Would I really run into the multiple comparisons effect? Dice rolls are independent of each other and my understanding was that this didn't apply to independent tests. The error should be simply the maximum of the error in any one test. Isn't it only when your tests have some correlation that the total error can be greater than the sum of individual errors?  3: For the ""SSS"" method I understand why it's not formally valid doing it the way you said. Might it be better to add the losses over all bins then divide by the weighted sum of expected losses ? Is this not formally valid? If not why?"
math,3c9rpo,PhantomX129,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:13:10 2015 UTC,"1)You could use a binomial confidence interval calculation, but a binomial proportion is well approximated by the normal whenever p*N >~10 (where p is the population rate and N is the number of binomial samples).  Technically for measuring a population rate from a sample rate you should use the t-test rather than the z-test, but as long as your samples are large enough the z-test is close enough for government work.  If you try it and find you only have a few samples in some of the buckets (like 1 attacker vs 2 defenders, probably) then those you should use absolute binomial confidence intervals for, but usually for very small samples significance is extremely hard to demonstrate anyways (since the confidence interval will be so large).  edit: in case it's unclear how to convert the outcome statistics into binomial proportions, it's a little bit up to you (you could also use a multinomial distribution over the range of possible outcomes for each bucket), but one procedure would be to consider each soldier lost a binomial trial, with success being a kill and failure being a loss (a little bit bad since for a particular roll, the outcomes are correlated, but hopefully you can ignore that effect).  Then the proportion of successful kills in the bucket is the sample binomial proportion, while the proportion you'd expect from the probability calculation would be the population proportion for your null hypothesis.  2)  You would absolutely run into multiple comparisons if you do what I recommended by checking each bucket for significance.  If you choose a confidence level of p=0.95, you're accepting a 5% risk of type-1 error for each bucket.  The problem is if you're looking at 10 buckets, and are going to go ""whoa that thing is significant"" for a single bucket, you're now accepting a risk of type-1 error across all buckets that's closer to 50% (well, a bit less because adding probabilities correctly, but lazy) - aka, a massive risk of a type-1 error occurring in at least one bucket.  That's what you're doing by correcting for multiple comparisons - making sure the risk of type-1 error across all buckets is 0.05, rather than per-bucket.  3)  Your approach is also not formally valid because again, you lose the ability to determine whether the outcome had a high probability of being due to chance (which is the primary goal of this kind of analysis).  Imagine if one of the possible battles was a 1000 vs 1000 soldier battle, and the battle rules were ""winner kills all losers based on the roll of 1 die each"" - it's completely reasonable for the outcome of this battle to go either way (e.g., it's not ""bad rolls for the day"" to lose that fight), but if you bundle the loss up with a bunch of other rolls then you lose all ability to discern whether somebody had bad luck in aggregate or not.   There are ways you could get around this (and obviously the effect in real risk is not as dramatic as that toy example), but it's a lot more effort than doing the analysis per-bucket then rolling up the buckets.  That said, you can of course calculate whatever metrics you're interested in :)  edit: didn't like my answer to #1 because I'm not sure how to map the roll outcomes to a binomial distribution nicely, but up there for posterity."

This way, Z_p becomes a commutative ring - that is, a set with notions of multiplication and addition that behave just like the integers (i.e. you have a(b+c) = ab + ac and all of that). So if you have a bunch of those p-adic representations, say (a0, a1, a2, . . .) and (b0, b1, b2, . . .), you can multiply (like (a0b0, a1b1, . . .)) and add (something like (a0+b0, a1 + b1, . . . )) with them in the obvious way, and it'll all work out.

On that note, sorry I'm so late. I've been wanting to respond to this, but I didn't want to do it on mobile. Anyway, I've been thinking about the p-adics on my off-time, and I'm wondering if this proof of compactness is correct. I haven't read anything on them, so I'm sorry if the terminology is somewhat off. Reading it over again, it looks a bit clunky.  So first, we need to impose an ordering on p-adic integers. If two numbers are not equal, their p-adic terms must differ at some point. At this point, the series with the larger term can be said to be greater than the other series. With this ordering, it's easy to prove that between any two series there is another.  First, pick two distinct integers, n and m. Then convert them to base p where p is a prime and the p-adic that we are working with. Now the kth term in the series is the k rightmost digits of whatever integer we are working with. As we've proven, these number will differ at some term. Let's use q to denote the number term they differ at. WLOG we can say that n's series is less than m's series (but n is not necessarily less than m). Now lets make a new number, r.   We construct r in this way: let a be the current digit we are working on, going from least to most significant. For all a <= q let that digit be equal to the corresponding digit in n. For a > q, we simply make each digit p-1 until the corresponding digit in n is < p-1. Therefore, it is obvious that q's series is less than m's, but greater than n's.   (As a final note, is there a word for digit when we aren't working in base 10? I know we have bit for base two, and maybe hexadigit for base 16, but is there a general word, like d-git?)"

math,3c6f52,suspiciously_calm,4,Sun Jul 5 11:57:48 2015 UTC,"A way to think of Compactness is that every sequence of p-adic integers has a subsequence that converges.  For instance, consider the sequence 1,2,3,4,5,6,... This sequence does not converge in Zp, but it contains the subsequence p,p2,p3,..., which converges to zero.  In general, each p-adic integer has a residue class mod p, mod p2, mod p3 and so on. If you have a sequence (ak) of p-adic integers, then since there are only p possible residue classes mod p, (by the pigeonhole principle), there must be an infinite number of them with the same residue class mod p. So we can cut it down to a  subsequence that has the same residue class mod p. Since each of these share the same residue class mod p, there are only p places that these can go mod p2, so there must by a subsequence of this that has the same residue class mod p2. In this way, for any finite pn, there is an infinite subsequence so that every element of this subsequence shares the same residue class mod pn, and we can push this to find more subsequences for higher powers of p. So we have an infinite sequence of nested subsequences of (ak). Ie, for each n, there is a subsequence (a(n,k)) so that everything in (a(n,k)) has the same value mod pn. Now we can consider the sequence a(1,1), a(2,1), a(3,1), of the first element in each of these subseqeunces. This sequence will converge to some p-adic integer."

math,3c9owu,Diggodoggo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:23:40 2015 UTC,"The graduate programs I'm referring to as ""serious"" are something like the top 50 (in the US news rankings).  I know graduate programs outside there have their individual strengths, but I don't feel knowledgeable to speak about job prospects for people not going somewhere top 50.     If you're interested in somewhere top 50, geometry and discrete math will help, I'm just saying math graduate programs are extremely competitive.  Many (most?) of the people who get in have taken a LOT of advanced, especially graduate, math courses.  They have done some kind of independent work (writing an original senior thesis, taking a reading course on an advanced subject outside the scope of a standard university math course, attended an REU program).  They spend a lot of time on their own figuring out problems that interest them.  Assuming you're American, also there is the fact that American undergraduates tend to be unskilled and ignorant in mathematical prowess compared to the huge amount of foreign talent which U.S. graduate programs accept in small numbers every year.  I'm not saying this to necessarily discourage you, but just to give you a realistic idea about the kind of applications which programs are inclined to accept.  As for making a few bad grades, I'm not really sure what graduate programs make of that.  It depends where you go to school.  If you go to Princeton, nobody is expecting you to have perfect grades.  Where I went to undergrad, most of the class just wanted to get their math degree and teach high school, so all I had to do was not be 100% confused about what was going on and I would get an A.   By the way, what is ""modern geometry?""  Geometry has really exploded in the last couple of centuries, you could be learning algebraic geometry, or differential geometry, or something more classical.  Any graduate programs you apply to will probably also want somewhat detailed descriptions of what material you covered in your courses."

I got started with math later than most I guess, I switched majors about 2 years into undergrad so I've been playing catch up ever since. I go to a bottom of the barrel school honestly, so I have no excuse for bad grades other than I just get lazy. I never had the money or the time for an REU, which is something I'll probably regret for a long time. When I say ""modern geometry"" I mean classical. Euclidean geometry, with the final 2 weeks being non-Euclidean.  All that being said, it sounds like I'm destined for mediocrity."

Subject knowledge is one of the 8 teaching standard you will be judged on, and involves all sorts of things.   Brush up on your core A - level: trig, differentiation, integration, etc. As you will need to teach at least a little bit of this. Having some Stats or Mechanics knowhow will give you extra timetabling options too, which will be useful.   The maths curriculum is changing in a big way in the next year or so; everything is becoming more cross curricular, and problem solving is becoming a big thing. These websites are good resources for this sort of activity (2 of my favourites) but there are a host of others:  http://mathschallenge.net/  http://nrich.maths.org/frontpage  Have a look through, and check that you understand the questions, and that you understand how to get the answer.  Maybe read up on the curriculum, the government Web pages have all that info on it.  In terms of other things, you need to organise the folders on your computer from the start. I found that organising by topic, then year group, then class, was a good way of doing it, and I wish I had done it like that from the start of the year.  When you start, you will need to instruct the kids on literally everything.

math,3c7b1f,unicornsandmuons,7,Sun Jul 5 15:35:50 2015 UTC,What is the complex frequency domain?
math,3c7b1f,kking254,15,Sun Jul 5 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"This is the right question.  The Fourier transform represents a time-domain function as a linear combination of the Fourier basis functions, which are functions of the form eiωt , where ω is real. These functions spin around the unit circle on the complex plane at angular frequency ω.  The Laplace transform represents a time-domain function as a linear combination of the Laplace basis functions, which are functions of the form est , where s is complex. If we let s=σ+iω, then we can rewrite these functions as eσt ⋅ eiωt . The second factor is the Fourier basis functions and the first factor is a real function that increases exponentially when σ>0 and decreases exponentially when σ<0. Put them together and the Laplace basis functions are ""spirals"" on the complex plane at angular frequency ω, spiraling outward (exponentially) for σ>0, inward for σ<0, and staying on the unit circle for σ=0.  EDIT: It might be useful to play with functions like these in wolfram by graphing their real part: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Re%5Be%5E%28%280.5%2B10i%29t%29%5D+from+-2+to+2"

math,3c7b1f,SassThisHoopyFrood,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:37:29 2015 UTC,you can also interpret it (actually the bilateral transform)  as taking a bunch of Fourier transforms of the system when 'modulated' or tested against a bunch of growing and decaying exponentials (which explains why the asymptotic constraints for the two differ so much--Fourier transform necessitates f → 0 as t → ∞ whereas Laplace simply needs it to be of exponential-type)
math,3c7b1f,FelineFysics,2,Sun Jul 5 20:12:07 2015 UTC,"Much like the complex domain has values for real and imaginary, the s-domain of complex frequencies help us to understand complex frequencies, and describe their effects on a system.  In electrical engineering, complex frequencies help us to determine if a system becomes unstable at certain frequencies. This gives us a shortcut to say, we really don't care how it responds at every frequency, we mostly just want to know when the system becomes unstable.  In s-domain analysis, we can examine these poles and zeroes to form a root locus method, which plots a line of characteristics to see when a system becomes unstable.  tl;dr s-domain analysis creates a line (through root locus methods) that tells us when the fit hits the shan."
math,3c7b1f,oldrinb,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:21:51 2015 UTC,"I am sure you can find a lot of resources online that tells you all the similarities and difference between Fourier and Laplace transform (in a sense, Laplace transform is just Fourier transform with a decaying exponential stuck to it). However, I have recently seen someone talking about the relation between Laplace transform and generating functions, which I think is quite interesting.    The (one-sided) Laplace transform of a complex-valued function f on the real line is [; \int_{0}^{\infty} {f(t) e^{-st} dt  ;]. Applying integration by part repeatedly yields [; \int_{0}^{\infty} {f(t) e^{-st} dt  = \frac{f(0)}{s} + \frac{1}{s} \int_{0}^{\infty} {f'(t) e^{-st} dt = \frac{f(0)}{s} + \frac{f'(0)}{s^2} + \frac{1}{s^2} \int_{0}^{\infty} {f''(t) e^{-st} dt = \dots ;].    So we might assume that for a well-behaved function, the remainder vanishes and the Laplace transform is given by [; \frac{f(0)}{s} + \frac{f'(0)}{s^2} + \dots ;]. The analogy with generating polynomials and z-transforms should be clear."

math,3c3oih,Bromskloss,8,Sat Jul 4 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"To anyone wondering why this is a paradox, it's because most people would assume that their friends are either average as people or at least drawn from the same pool that they themselves are. If that drawing is random (and fair), then you would expect your rank, in terms of number of friends, among your friends to be about 50%. Most often, though, that is not the case, and most people find themselves with fewer friends than their friends have.  Mathematically minded people may not have fallen for the trap, but I know that I at least did before I truly sat and thought about it once."

For a person v, the number of friends is deg(v) and the average number of friends that v's friends have is  `[; \frac{\sum_{u \in N(v)} deg(u)}{deg(v)} ;]`   Thus, average over all people v of the difference between the average number of friends that v's friends have and the number of friends that v has is  `[; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{v} (\frac{\sum_{u \in N(v)} deg(u)}{deg(v)} - deg(v)) ;]`   Which equals  `[; \frac{1}{n} (\sum_{(u, v): u\in N(v)} (\frac{deg(u)}{deg(v)} + \frac{deg(v)}{deg(u)}) - 2|E|) ;]`   Applying the easy fact that a/b + b/a for positive a, b is always at least two (with equality when a=b), this quantity is non-negative.

However, students have to (a) ask for these and (b) recover from whatever caused them to need it.  This disproportionately affects low-income students for several reasons:  (1) They're not raised to expect or ask for things like this. Despite the narrative of the ""greedy poor"", sociological studies have consistently shown that those raised in a low socioeconomic class are less aware of available help and less likely to seek what is available, even when they know of available resources.  (2) Some events are preventable, but doing so costs money. This is particularly true for chronic health conditions. Many people develop chronic ill health that could have been managed with proper medical help at an earlier stage.  (3) They have fewer resources with which to recover. Extra tutoring costs money (and see (1) for why campus tutoring centers are not necessarily effective in this regard); counseling costs money, etc.  (4) Time spent doing homework is time not spent working. For students who are able to eke out just enough time to study effectively, any schedule disruption can ruin a whole term due to lost study time.

I'm curious, do you know much about politics? Because districting is a very complex process and has nothing to do with equally dividing populations. But even if we accepted your (incorrect) view, your own answer doesn't make sense. You have n houses in a county. How do you divide them up? According to what principles; and what specific rules in support of the general principles?  I don't mean to pile on, but this is a very complicated question that your response hasn't really addressed. It's political more than mathematical unless you clearly state your mathematical criteria.  Consider (to change the subject a bit) the question of whether you should have ""at large"" or district-by-district elections of city council members. At-large disadvantages ethnic and cultural neighborhoods, whose candidates can't win general elections. But district-by-district representation puts people in power who have no city-wide support, but only strong support from one neighborhood or affinity group.   Again, these are complicated questions that are political in nature. You might start reading here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistricting, but that's barely scratching the surface. Next to raising money, redistricting is the single most important obsession of politicians."
math,3c7cm1,gregbard,2,Sun Jul 5 21:43:53 2015 UTC,"I am not trying to define neighborhood, I was explaining that a precinct is an already defined pre-existing ""neighborhood sized"" region where all the voters within that precinct vote in the same location. Precincts are the smallest unit, other than individuals that you could cluster into a district.  For the house district and the state senate districts, the choice of at large versus by district is already made. They must be single member districts.  What I am suggesting is that ""districting is a very complex process"" is false. It is only made into a complex process when you start to consider factors that contradict other factors.   Should the largest city be place in one district thereby dominating that district or should the largest city be split into two districts either dominating both of them or possibly being overwhelmed by both? Is that concern as important as making sure all the coal producing counties are in the same district thereby ensuring that an important industry have its voice in government or should that influence be diffused to ensure that the coal industry doesn't get a foot hold into government?  Which of these questions is the most important is a political question itself. I think that after a bloodbath after the 2010 redistricting and because the majority party holds a thin majority that is vulnerable, that the politicians might welcome an opportunity to give random chance the opportunity to resolve those questions. Otherwise, what constitutes an ""important concern"" is a thinly veiled attempt to perserve my own election district at the expense of another delegate.  When it comes to dividing political districts into single member districts there are only three constitutional concern: (1) not designed to disenfranchise minorities, (2) roughly equal populations to ensure one man, one vote, and (3) contiguousness of the district.  The roughly equal part is important because the USSC said that states cannot apportion seats on the basis of counties if that results in a disproportionate representation of the residents of some counties. The US Senate system translated to the states, where each county gets one senator, is unconstitutional for the states."

math,3c6r2d,laonious,5,Sun Jul 5 11:59:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert in this topic, but my understanding is that Weil noticed a connection between the number of solutions to f(x, y) =0 over a finite field and the topology of the surface described by f over the complex numbers.   Specifically, he conjectured that there ought to be a cohomology theory connecting the two, and this turned out to be etale cohomology."
math,3c6r2d,hbetx9,5,Sun Jul 5 14:48:24 2015 UTC,"This won't be the best answer, but essentially arithmetic geometry is the study of solutions to polynomial equations over integers. Yes, this means things like diophantine geometry (what are the rational triples (x,y,z) with x3 + y3 = z3, etc), however also other number theoretic variants of such questions (solutions in various number fields etc). In some sense, the main problems of interest are to fix some polynomial equations, and a particular number field, and ask about the structure or number of the solutions in that field.   One of the primary things you should look into the see the connections between these two, and topology, are elliptic curves. In one sense, these are complex varieties (alg. geometry) given by a single projective cubic. The rational points of such curves are of significant number theoretic interest. This gives a very concrete example of Riemann surfaces, which is a wonderfully deep area and origin of many modern lines of mathematical thought in all three of the areas you expressed interest in.   Things like Etale cohomology and Weil conjectures come about by trying to replicate arguments from alg. topology in the purely arithmetic geometry setting. In particular, the usual topology for varieties is not Hausdorff, and therefore, many of the often used tools (Lefschetz theorems etc) are unavailable.   One of the landmark (in my opinion) pieces of mathematics in the last century was the realization by Weil that, given a suitable abstract cohomology theory for varieties, one could prove big conjectures, among them the Riemann hypothesis. However, the natural cohomology theory simply doesn't work. Here is where Grothendieck really stepped to the plate and showed us the tools from algebraic topology, cohomology in particular, do not need a true topological space to work with. We can allow generalized ""open sets"" arising as the images of other varieties under nice enough maps (in this case etale maps.) This was sufficient to work for varieties over function fields (things like F_q((t))), which are truly characteristic p. The remaining directions are significant, deep, and very far from complete.   At the end of the day, you will find this topic very difficult and fraught with many words you don't know, unless you study all three for a while. Instead, use subjects such as Riemann surfaces, elliptic curves, etc as more complete (though far from really well understood) pictures where you can see all the parts moving at once. As natural questions arise, you will find yourself needing more tools, and naturally will come to understand what the important tools/topics are more generally."
math,3c6r2d,SheafCobromology,3,Mon Jul 6 02:17:15 2015 UTC,"So consider a polynomial equation like y2 = x5 + 2x2 - 3x + 5. Classical algebraic geometry studies the solution set of such equations over the complex numbers. Away from a singular set of strictly positive codimension, this set has the structure of a complex manifold, in particular it carries a nice Hausdorff topology on which singular cohomology is well-behaved. In addition, this set carries the Zariski topology, which is purely algebraic and is defined over any field, but which is fairly disastrous from the point of view of topological cohomology. An equation such as the one above with Z-coefficients can be considered over C or over a finite field (by reducing its coefficients mod p)  Recall also that one of the basic purposes of topological cohomology is to refine the Euler characteristic. Since cohomology is functorial, we see that the Euler characteristic is functorial; associated to any continuous map f:X -> X we have a bunch of linear maps f* : Hi (X) -> Hi (X). We can take the traces of these linear maps and, just as when we compute the Euler characteristic, take their alternating sum to obtain an invariant of the map, the Lefschetz number. Just as the vanishing of the Euler characteristic is a necessary (but not sufficient!) condition for a space to admit a non-vanishing vector field, the vanishing of the Lefschetz number is a necessary-but-not-sufficient condition for a map to have no fixed points.  Andre Weil's insight was that ""rational points of an algebraic variety over a finite field,"" i.e. solutions to a polynomial which live in a given finite field, should be thought of as special points of the solution set over the algebraic closure, specifically fixed points of the Frobenius endomorphism which acts thereupon. So he conjectured the existence of an algebraic cohomology theory which would (1) coincide with singular cohomology when the variety was considered over C, and (2) satisfy an analogue of the Lefschetz fixed point theorem (or rather the stronger Lefschetz-Hopf theorem, which actually counts fixed points more-or-less) so that by taking the Frobenius trace on cohomology one could count rational points. The development of Grothendieck-style algebraic geometry was primarily fueled by the goal of constructing such a cohomology theory."

In a superficial way category theory envelopes large parts of mathematics, but only in giving it a uniform outward appearance. The real content of most of these mathematical theories is at a deeper level of complexity. Group theory doesn't unify abstract harmonic analysis and algebraic number theory. It just provides a common linguistic starting point from which the theories develop. An idea that's shared identically between many mathematical theories is typically a starting point that enables other ideas, but which is usually too general itself to contain the core of the theories in which it plays a role. Category theory is an extreme example of this.  There have been suggestions by some mathematicians that the Langlands Program will play a kind of a unifying role in mathematics. This is a more mathematically meaningful statement, but it's still not unification in the same sense as in physics. It refers to a collection of results and conjectures that describe deep mathematical phenomena, in other words fundamentally irreducible complex patterns, which involve entirely separate mathematical fields, indeed such as harmonic analysis and number theory. These ideas connect large groups of previously disparate mathematics, but they don't subsume them. If you will excuse a topological metaphor, they reduce in complexity not the first but the zeroth fundamental group of known mathematics.  If there's an endless supply of undiscovered fundamentally irreducible complex patterns, we will of course never find one mathematical theory to explain all of them. Empirical evidence so far suggests this to be the case. But then again, there is a largest sporadic finite simple group.

I think that's a poor example to pick.  The consensus among mathematicians is to adopt the axiom of choice. Weak forms of it are necessary to even get off the ground in analysis. For instance, there are models of choiceless set theory where the epsilon-delta definition of continuity isn't equivalent to the sequential definition of continuity. Important theorems like the Hahn-Banach theorem, Tychonoff's theorem, Gödel's completeness theorem, that every field has an algebraic closure, etc. require a significant fragment of choice, if not the full strength of choice, to prove.  Moreover, there has been work on alternatives to choice. Solovay showed, for example, that it's consistent to have every set of reals be Lebesgue measurable, while still having a strong enough fragment of choice to do much of analysis. The axiom of determinacy implies that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the property of Baire, has the perfect set property, etc., while also still having enough choice to do much of analysis. But the response among mathematicians has not been to abandon the axiom of choice in favor of these alternate approaches.  It's certainly true that there are set theoretic statements which are independent of the usual axioms and for which we don't have a consensus. (However, note that such statements are not confined to set theory; the Whitehead problem is an algebraic example.) But the axiom of choice is not one of them."

math,3c2nto,DFractalH,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:42:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's a great example. There is no consensus about the axiom of choice (not that consensus is particularly relevant to mathematics), as illustrated by the well known joke ""The axiom of choice is obviously true, the well-ordering principle obviously false, and who knows about Zorn's Lemma""; to those reading this who are unfamiliar with the joke, all three of those things are equivalent.  Here's a great mathoverflow thread on the subject, and some quotes I took from different posts.   (1) First, in mathematical situations where one can prove the existence of a mathematical structure without AC, then important consequences often follow concerning the complexity of that structure. An explicit construction, even if more complicated that a pure existence proof from AC, often carries with it computational information concerning the nature of the object constructed, such as whethere it is analytic or Borel or Δ12, and so on, and these complexity issues can affect other arguments concerning measurability and whatnot. That is, by nature the non-AC constructions are more explicit and these more explicit argument often carry more information.  But second, there remain certain parts of set-theoretic investigation that only make sense in non-AC contexts. The Axiom of Determinacy, for example, stands in contradiction with the Axiom of Choice but nevertheless contains some fascinating, profound mathematical work, pointing to a kind of mathematical paradise, in which every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, every set has the property of Baire and the perfect set property. This axiom leads to an alternative vision of what set theory could be like. The possibilities of AD place limitations on what we can expect to prove in ZFC, in part because we expect that there are set-theoretic universe close to our own where AD holds. That is, we are interested in AD even if we believe fundamentally in AC, because we can construct the universe L(R), where AD could hold, even if AC holds in the outer universe V. In order to understand L(R), we need to know which theorems we can rely on there, and so we need to know where we used AC.  (2) In all of these cases, the ""axiom of choice"" fails. In fact, from the internal-category perspective, the axiom of choice is the following simple statement: every surjection (""epimorphism"") splits, i.e. if f:X→Y is a surjection, then there exists g:Y→X so that f∘g=idY. But this is simply false in the topological, Lie, and algebraic categories. This leads to all sorts of extra rich structure if you do algebra internal to these categories. You have to start thinking about bundles rather than products, there can be ""anomalies"", etc. I think this is the real reason to avoid AC when you can: even if it's true for boring old sets, in lots of other natural situations it's just false.  (3) Now, the reason why I believe that the axiom of choice is obviously false is that gives us an embedding of the field of p-adic numbers into C which seems fishy as they are constructed in such different ways. In fact if you try to pin down such an embedding by asking for it to fulfil more conditions then it doesn't exist. This is true if you ask that it be measurable or take definable numbers to definable numbers and so on. My own feeling is that its existence is so counter-intuitive that it couldn't possibly existst. On the other hand such an embedding is used over and over again in say the theory of ℓ-adic cohomology. It is true that in that case at least it can be avoided  (4) We have a proof that AC is independent of the other axioms of ZF. But that's not a good enough criterion for deciding whether or not to use an axiom. We choose axioms because because we want to use them to reason reliably. We can use ZF to reason about mundane things like strings of symbols encoded with Godel numbering. But Godel's Incompleteness Theorem shows that we can find axioms independent of ZF, which when added to ZF, give incorrect results when applied to strings of symbols. I think some people worry that AC may allow us to reason incorrectly in some domains, even if it is consistent with ZF. (Of course we don't know ZF itself is consistent, or allows us to reason correctly, either, but the fewer axioms the better.)   Mathematicians generally don't hesitate to invoke the axiom of choice when applicable, but that's really only because we now know it's consistent with ZF. IME many regard it as a notational tool. That sentiment is expressed here   The way I always justified the usage of the axiom of choice to myself (which I haven't had to do very often) is as an expositional convenience. If somebody told me that I couldn't use the axiom of choice anymore, I would take all the theorems I know about commutative rings and replace ""Let R be a commutative ring"" with ""Let R be a commutative ring with a maximal ideal"", and then I would go about my business, since nobody cares about the crappy ring you slapped together which doesn't have a maximal ideal."

You can do algebra without the Lemma of Zorn? Colour me surprised. Maybe I simply don't get what ""algebra internal to a category"" is, but to me many of the mentioned categories need the Lemma of Zorn in order to be interesting in the first place.  Edit: In fact, I wonder how you can even do ""analysis internal"" to something without C. Simply because measure theory usually breaks down unless you have at least some weak choice. So maybe it's just important for people who are interested in doing some work internal to certain categories, but not concern themselves with the particular properties of the objects themselves."

It's the same with any discipline: economics, physics, even psychology and philosophy. In short: diversity ramps up creativity.  Eliminating mathematical discipline diversity would subdue (or oppress, or otherwise diminish) at least two of the primary outlets for this creativity: (1) there would no longer exist opposing disciplines to clash against each other and (2) there would now exist this enormous, intimidating field that encourages one - and only one - way to approach an issue.  The only gain in a unifying theory would be a text about a half-meter tall entitled Math, half of which would be crammed to fit some new framework that would likely take the better part of a century to correct/perfect.

math,3c2nto,completely-ineffable,4,Sat Jul 4 14:51:35 2015 UTC,"No. Math can be thought of as a sort of science in many ways, but not this one. The main issue is that unlike physics where things are either true or not true, math has definitions and axioms which can be taken as true and both systems can be correct. Perhaps the best example of this is geometry, where you can chose to accept all five of Euclid's axioms or you can choose to only accept some of them. Only accepting some of them leads to totally different systems but all of these systems are entirely ""true"" because they are logically derived from axioms.  Another issue is something called Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, which essentially states that given a finite set of rules there will always be indeterminate cases in a set of mathematical rules? What does this mean exactly? Well consider the classic thought experiment of the Barber's Paradox, which is stated as follows; ""In a town with one barber, all men either shave themselves or are shaved by the barber. In this scenario, does the barber shave himself?"" This is a paradox because given the two rules or ""axioms"" the vase of the barber shaving himself is not able to be determined. Perhaps the barber goes elsewhere to be shaved. Perhaps the barber also shaves himself. However, without explicitly defining a case for the barber, we can never logically deduce it from the original set of rules. Gödel proved that essentially all of mathematics was in a sense like this, where there would always be cases that are impossible to answer within any given system."

First off, the incompleteness theorems have nothing to do with Russell's paradox. Second, you've misstated the Barber version of Russell's paradox. The paradox isn't that the behavior of the barber is undetermined by the assumptions. (Why would that even be called a paradox? Many things are undetermined by weak assumptions.) Instead, the paradox is that the assumptions are contradictory. The barber shaves only and exactly all men who don't shave themselves (note that this is not quite how you phrased it).

The push towards reductionist thinking in physics is essentially empirically motivated—we think there may indeed be a unified theory of nature because we've found so many interconnections between far flung observations. The unification of electromagnetism and the weak force comes to mind as a particularly stunning example and its prediction and subsequent discovery of the Higgs Boson reaffirms that line of thinking. Maybe nature really does operate this way. This rivals the unification of electricity and magnetism during the 19th century and we patiently await the next unification breakthrough if it exists. Things like AdS/CFT correspondence feel like we're at least pointed in the right direction.    Mathematics on the other hands to my limited experience doesn't have such restrictions, it is more of a canvas of human thought than a great singular puzzle and I have not seen a pressure to unify far flung mathematics fields outside the human curiosity to see if such mathematics can be constructed or not."

math,3c2nto,FunnyBunnyTummy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:00:43 2015 UTC,"I'm going to offer a slightly differing opinion. I don't think the question is reasonable without a good definition of theory. We say things like number theory, or Galois theory, etc, however these are really not reflective of the use of theory in physics etc.   People are saying category theory is the unification, but I rather disagree. First off, that is like saying ring theory is a unification of the interesting mathematics of the integers, rationals, reals, and complexes because they are all rings. However, one really thinks about each of these very differently, where as even the last three are in some sense trivial ""as rings"".   In the same regard, many areas of mathematics (PDEs, many forms of analysis, etc) are not ""categorical"" and yet others, while category theory can describe the area, the category structure isn't the interesting part.   We tend to think of various areas of math as theories, and categories do give a very deep way of understanding the connections (see the many examples of categorical equivalences), however, these theories didn't need any real ""unification"" in the first place, they were the same all along!  So to ask for a ""unifying theory"" you need to both describe what is meant by theory, and then give a meaning behind what is desired by unification. In physics, this is much more clear as the rules of various systems simply are incompatible, not just lack an efficient unified description. The actual rules change, and those changes need explanation as we know there is a unification of the ideas (we live in it). In contrast, with mathematics, what sorts of things need to be unified and how do we even know if such unifications are possible?"

math,3c5ak1,Midtek,3,Mon Jul 6 02:01:26 2015 UTC,"My PhD is in applied mathematics, and I can say that your rough schedule is about what I took and/or actually use in my work. Specifically, this was my general coursework:  Undergraduate:  (1) Linear algebra, Calc 3, ODE, Probability & Stats, Intro physics (year long course)  (2) two terms of real analysis, one term of complex analysis, intro algebra, classical mechanics, E&M  (3) Galois theory, Lie algebras, two terms of quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics & thermodynamics, stochastic processes  (4) algebraic topology, graduate real analysis, set theory, mathematical logic  Graduate:  (1) real analysis, complex analysis, topology, differential geometry  (2) PDE I, PDE II (lots of analysis, Sobolev spaces and the like), fluid mechanics, intro general relativity (seminar course)  (2) stochastic calculus, PDEs for finance (which is basically more stochastic calculus), applied stochastic analysis, functional analysis  (3) geophysical fluid dynamics, ocean dynamics, atmospheric dynamics, biological fluid mechanics  (4) numerical approximation and analysis, intro plasma physics, statistical mechanics, scientific computing  Research  My specific field of research is plasma physics. When I was an undergraduate, I thought I should just take everything because I thought that's what you were supposed to do. I absolutely hated algebra and found it much more difficult than my analysis courses and my physics courses. In retrospect, I probably would have just skipped all algebra beyond intro algebra. I didn't decide on applied math and physics until my second year of graduate school. I was interested in GR, and so I feel like my time learning geometry and topology was not wasted. But I certainly do not use it at all in my research. Obviously, once you decide on what subfields interest you most, you will take specialized courses or courses you would not have looked at previously. For me, I didn't think much of financial mathematics or stochastic calculus. I do not use all of the methods I learned in those courses, but PDEs are a primary object of my research.  In summary, I can say that I have not used anything from the following courses since I took them: Galois theory, Lie algebras, set theory, mathematical logic (although those last two were actually fun), topology, differential geometry (the last two I only ever used again to understand GR). I have used the following courses very minimally since I took them: functional analysis, PDE II, graduate topology, graduate geometry.  I don't want to give the impression though that you should not take courses that you will not use again. The thing about the general flow of school is that you need to take a whole bunch of courses that you don't really like or need, just so you can take higher courses that you also don't need, so that you can get into grad school, where you then gradually just throw certain topics by the wayside entirely as you focus towards your PhD. (For instance, if you plan on attending an American school, then you will need to take the Math GRE, which requires knowledge of basically every undergraduate topic, including analysis, algebra, ODEs, etc.)  For any career or PhD in applied mathematics, I would say the following courses are an absolute must before graduate school.  (1) linear algebra, two terms  (2) real analysis, two terms  (3) complex analysis, two terms  (4) ODE, PDE  (5) probability and statistics  (6) at least 4 or so courses in some non-math field, like physics, chemistry, computer science, etc.  As to category 6, I essentially took all of the required courses for the physics major, with the exception of most of the associated labs. So I was already well familiar with dynamical systems, ODEs, PDEs, and principles of classical and quantum mechanics (e.g., Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations). I felt really comfortable when I started taking my graduate math/physics courses, and I think it would have been a lot harder had I ignored that in my undergraduate. You mention wanting to take both biology and computer science courses. I think if you want to reach the level of at least an intermediate undergraduate in both fields, you would need to start early with filling up your course schedule with bio and comp sci courses. You might consider just focusing on one field you really like.  The 6 categories above are all I would say that was really needed for my graduate program at NYU, which is a very prestigious applied maths program. In fact, the first four categories above are exactly the required topics of the general oral exams, and the first three categories are the topics on the three written exams.  Numerical analysis and computing is not a necessity but a very big advantage. I strongly recommend that you be familiar with programming before you enter graduate school. Nothing too fancy. A working knowledge of MATLAB, for instance, is more than sufficient. A lot of applied math is numerical analysis and the quicker you can get into that coursework the better. You can also see from my own program that the later years of my coursework were almost all very specific to my field of study (i.e., fluid mechanics, atmo/ocean dynamics, plasma physics, etc.). Your first 3-4 semesters of graduate school will pretty much be standard, maybe with one or two electives chosen differently. If you continue to the PhD, your last 2 years of coursework will consist of courses that are 100% relevant to your specific field of research. You will likely have a slot here and there for, say, a seminar course that is purely just for fun and something you know you do not want to pursue beyond a few lectures.  My PhD advisor (for a math PhD) has his PhD in physics from MIT. The reality is that neither of us really ever needs pure math in our research. Or if we do it's something that we learned in a graduate course, don't remember, and need to look back at a few chapters in a text to remind ourselves of it. Don't get too hung up on feeling like you have to know everything and that you need to be extremely well-rounded in all subjects of math. At the undergraduate level, you are definitely going to feel like you're learning everything anyway. Because, well.... it's just a bit bizarre to think a graduate math student has never seen algebra or has no idea what a topology is. But certainly do not feel like you have to continue to be well-rounded in graduate school. If you are decided on applied maths, then just don't bother with things like functional analysis, graduate algebra, graduate topology, geometry, etc. unless you specifically need that course for your specific field of research.  Your general strategy for undergraduate should be to take an intro course in every topic, since you need it for the graduate entrance exams. Then take the intermediate and advanced courses in topics that are suited to applied maths, like linear algebra, real/complex analysis, ODE/PDE, and numerical analysis."

You should also be very comfortable with MATLAB. Familiarity with Python as well.   Do all of the above and you will have the minimum to be competitive. You still have to do well on your GRE subject exam though and that's gonna be some pure math.  & if you have time, the following courses in discrete mathematics:   Combinatorics Graph Theory Abstract Algebra Topology"

math,3c5ak1,EuclidsLostPrime,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:48:15 2015 UTC,I know OP is talking about PhD work... But  Are some of those courses things one could catch up with in a masters program?   I have a similar undergrad profile (due to switching majors a couple times before going to math) and have filled a lot of elective credits with CS courses (for an A.S.)
math,3c5ak1,sillymath22,2,Sun Jul 5 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"The answer is yes! You should develop foundational math skills in undergrad (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations). I can't see anybody being admitted to any applied math program without these subjects.   Otherwise, you could catch up on Analysis, Probability, Statistics, PDE, etc in a masters program for sure. It'd be at the grad level and easier if you had some background of course. In general, masters programs draw people from a wider variety of disciplines, so the coursework needs to catch everyone up to the same level."
math,3c5ak1,biostrike,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:16:26 2015 UTC,So Master's programs are often used as stepping stones to PhD programs? Does that mean they are less picky than doctoral programs about who they admit?
math,3c5ak1,henny943,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:20:58 2015 UTC,"Short answer:   No Yes.   Long answer:  First, I want to say that it is different in the USA vs. abroad. I am speaking from an American perspective. Abroad, people usually need a masters first before applying to PhD. In the USA, students typically apply to a math PhD straight out of undergrad (with the word ""PhD"" really being a word for masters+PhD combined program).   As a result, there is a general sentiment that people with math masters are just PhDs who failed out, or weren't good enough to get into a PhD program. Some schools (such as mine) don't even have masters math programs; you just apply to PhD and get the masters in the process.  However, I do have to say that this sentiment is far more true for pure math. Applied math is a little different. People use applied math masters as industry preparation rather than as a stepping stone to a PhD and oftentimes such masters programs are geared towards placing you in industry. They are also less picky than doctoral programs in that you don't need to find an advisor to work under."

This is not possible, at best you can prove that ¬∀x.A(x) ⇒ ¬¬∃x.¬A(x) carrying out the usual classical proof.  If A were decidable, i.e. you have a proof that ∀x.A(x)∨¬A(x), then you could say that surely you can find such an x, you can test out each element of the universe of discourse in sequence until you find out one for which A is false, which you know it will be found because you know that ¬∀x.A(x). This justifies Markov's Principle, which is weaker than what you're trying to prove, and is unprovable in intuitionistic logic.  TL;DR: Yes, you need excluded middle."

I never gave it that much of a thought because I just told myself ""yeah, unbounded search, that makes sense"", and hastly generalized the justification to arbitrary predicates in my mind but never thought about the uncountable case. Mhm...  Anyhow, what I wanted to point out is that there's something in-between allowing full ¬∀x.A(x) ⇒ ∃x.¬A(x) and having ¬∀x.A(x) ⇒ ¬¬∃x.¬A(x) at best, but went a bit too philosophical while doing it."
math,3c3b84,sheafification,2,Sat Jul 4 11:39:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's the point.  In intuitionistic logic proofs must be constructive. So saying that ∃x.¬A(x), is equivalent to saying that we know an 'a' such that ¬A(a). Now we have a counterexample to ∀x.A(x) (Indeed, we can prove A(a) which is a contradiction).  OTOH, ¬∀x.A(x) tells us that there exists an element 'a' such that ¬A(a), but we have no constructive way of finding that element because, in general, the elements may be uncountably many."
math,3c3b84,anvsdt,4,Sat Jul 4 12:11:25 2015 UTC,"You seem to have a focus on uncountability which is a different issue than constructability.  Markov's prinicple is a statement about countable sets, yet is not provable within constructive logic. Even if you have you know that A(n) is not false for all natural n, and for any specific n you can test whether A(n) is true or false, you still cannot constructively find an n such that A(n) is true. Many computer scientists find this unpalatable: ""just check every case, and since you know the search cannot continue forever, then it must terminate"". In fact, some schools of constructability find it so self-evident that they take it as an axiom.  However, Markov's principle still does not actually construct the appropriate value - you might sense a similarity with double negation cancelation: ""if it is not possible for a statement to be false, then it must be true"".  You may also find the Limited Omniscience Principles (also not provable within constructive logic) to be illuminating."
math,3c3b84,tsehable,2,Sun Jul 5 01:10:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's exactly how it is for intuitionistic logic.  Markov's principle was more of a trivia than something directly related to the discussion."
math,3c3b84,tsehable,3,Sat Jul 4 12:22:02 2015 UTC,"The converse is not provable in intuitionistic logic. In intuitionistic systems we have something called the existence, or witness, property which means that if you can prove [;    \exists x A(x)    ;] then you can prove [; A(c) ;] for some term c in the language you're working in. It follows if we do some proof theoretic analysis of possible prooftrees. The idea is basically we can show that in any proof of [; \exists x A(x) ;] we can assume that it is normal (or cut-free if you're doing sequent calculus) and then see that the only way to introduce the symbol [; \exists ;] is by applying its own introduction rule. This is where the difference happens with the classical case where the symbol could also be introduced from a RAA-rule application. (It could also result from a [; \bot ;]-elimination but this case is irrelevant since we can show that if it were then either that branch of the proof-tree is irrelevant or [; \bot ;] is itself provable from our assumptions)  Since an application of the introduction rule for [; \exists ;] requires us to already have proved [; A(c) ;] for some term c we have found a proof of this statement as well. The final details are just about this being an induction on the height of possible proof-trees.  However such a witness is not guaranteed from just [; \neg \forall x A(x) ;] as we know from the many examples of non-constructive existence theorems in standard maths. (We could go into a bit more about semantics for intuitionistic models to prove this explicitly)  If you want more detail I'll gladly clarify any part. If you're interested in a less formal discussion of this type of property I'd recommend looking up the BHK-interpretation of intuitionistic logic."
math,3c3b84,tsehable,2,Sat Jul 4 11:57:00 2015 UTC,However such a witness is not guaranteed from just [; \neg \forall x A(x) ;] as we know from the many examples of non-constructive existence theorems in standard maths.   The only obstacle I can see is that the elements can be uncountably many so there isn't a general algorithm which can generate a witness in all cases. Does this make sense?
math,3c3b84,tsehable,2,Sat Jul 4 12:24:10 2015 UTC,That is one way in which we wouldn't be able to generate a witness of [; \exists x A(x) ;] only assuming we know [; \neg \forall x A(x) ;] but it is not the only case.   The witness property however is a bit more general then this problem. What it says is that if we can prove [; \exists x A(x) ;] then we can also find a witness for it by following the method I outlined above. In a sense we can't prove existence statements without finding witnesses which is one of the main ideas of constructivism.  EDIT: I reread your comment and actually parsed what in my comment you referred to. The thing is that the witness is a term in the language not as an element of a model. In my sketch of a proof for the witness property we showed that any possible proof would be by finding a witness term in the language. This is different from trying to find a witnessing element of some model of the language since finding such a model and element would only give us consistency with our assumption rather than a proof of the existence statement.
math,3c3b84,W_T_Jones,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:30:17 2015 UTC,I know nothing about logic so I'm just trying to understand what you're saying.   This is different from trying to find a witnessing element of some model of the language since finding such a model and element would only give us consistency with our assumption rather than a proof of the existence statement.   So finding a witness term is equivalent to prove that we can find a witness element in every model?
math,3c112o,doublethink1984,41,Fri Jul 3 19:54:48 2015 UTC,"I'm currently a math and physics major in a liberal arts college and I thought I might add a little bit.   In my college, the math and physics department is just one combined department here and is probably one of the smallest departments on campus. There are about 16 math majors and maybe 7 physics majors total with a few of us majoring in both so class sizes are incredibly small. Nearly all of my physics and math classes have had less than 10 people it with only big general classes like calculus and stats which capped out at around ~35 students. We have 5 math professors and 5 physics professors and a few retired professors in the area that teach an occasional class or two.  I feel like the culture and mindset of a professor in a liberal arts college is a lot different compared to those that work in big research institutes. The previous posters made it sound like people only teach at liberal arts colleges because they couldn’t make it somewhere big. People become professors at liberal arts colleges because they want to teach and they like teaching. All the professors have a passion for teaching their respective subjects and interacting with our students. All of our classes are taught by full time faculty (we have no adjuncts unless you count the retired professors that occasionally teach a class) and the only time you’ll see a student teach is if they’re working for the campus tutoring service. In big universities, I feel like there’s not that much attention given to students until they're well into their upper division classes. None of the professors even want to be department chair because even though they would have a higher salary and be in a position with more “prestige” they would have to teach less and do more administrative paperwork. They would rather just teach students so the professors just rotate baring the burden of department chair every few years. All the professors would rather interact with the students because they want to share the passion they have for their field with their students.   Because of the strong emphasis in teaching, you probably won’t be doing as much research. Some professors do more grant writing than others but most don’t even bother with research. Some professors do side research in their free time and will submit things to get published but there are quite a few professors that open their research for students. Again, because we’re small we do go to other larger institutions to do our procedures (at least for physics) but basically everybody that goes through our department gets a substantial amount of research because you're basically “competing” with 3 other people for 5 open spots.   As for qualifications, it’s the same/ similar to being a professor at a larger campus. All my professors have a PhD in their field from very good institutions (one of my math professors has a DA, same logic that he wanted to teach higher level math, not necessarily do research in it) except for one of my physics professors who never completed his PhD but has a lot of experience doing research at CERN and one of the new math professors they recently hired that just needs to defend her dissertation. I will say, getting a job at my college probably isn’t as competitive as some place like MIT or even the average state school, but you do need to be just as qualified to teach at a liberal arts school. I’ve noticed that lots of the professors also are alumni so it might be slightly harder for an “outsider” to teach here but that’s more speculation on my part and I wouldn’t say it’s substantial.  There are quite a few downsides though. I know for a fact that our professors don’t make as much as they should compared to other larger institutions. Our course catalog is substantial enough but if you’re really passionate to teach a certain subject that might just be marginally obscure or specific, you probably won’t be able to teach it because of lack of time and resources (especially if it’s a graduate course because you’re not ever teaching grad students). Despite this, professors have been able to add courses to the catalog and they can also guide a student through independent studies in a subject not offered by the college (just last year a few students asked a professor if he could teach a topology class and he gladly volunteered his time to teach the class even though we don’t technically offer one). Also, some classes are offered once every other year but I think it’s more of an inconvenience to the students with scheduling more than the professors.   I’ve been lucky to have professors that really go above and beyond when it comes to helping they’re students learn. Lots of professors invite students to their houses for dinner on the weekends and are just really nice, caring people. Though all liberal arts schools aren’t the same, I feel like smaller size of liberal arts school in general just attracts and fosters professors who are excellent educators. There are a lot more opportunities for student-teacher interactions. Of course I wouldn’t say all the professors I had were good, but in general they do care a lot and go out of their way to help students. I probably blabbed on about the student’s perspective rather than the professors, but I hope I helped. If you have any more specific questions, I’d happy to answer.  TL;DR- Become a professor at a liberal arts college because you love teaching students."

The professors here are brilliant in their fields and could easily be teaching at larger schools, but they all share a passion for teaching students in small class sizes and lots of one on one help. A lot of them teach here because they love the mountains and outdoor recreation as well. I've gone mountain biking with my professors and constantly run into them on the ski slopes. They teach here because they love math and sharing that passion with us, but they also love to live life and have fun outside of the classroom. A lot of people are on here saying that only the ones who aren't good enough to teach at large university's end up in small liberal arts schools and that may be true in some cases, but my professors are top notch and really know their shit. I love being able to walk into their office at anytime to get help on a proof that is stumping me and then end up sitting there for as long as I want to gain an understanding of the problem and get a crash course into other awesome topics that are absolutely fascinating.

math,3c112o,hollowman17,8,Sat Jul 4 04:24:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a math professor at a liberal arts college.  My preparation was the same as someone who would teach at a research institution.  I teach 12 semester hours each term, which is either 3 or 4 classes, usually no more than three preps.  I'm going to guess that research institutions are going to be more tolerant of the stereotypical eccentricities that mathematicians possess, and as others have said, at a liberal arts school, teaching is of utmost importance.    That said, there is still a scholarship component.  When I started (more than 15 years ago), peer-reviewed publications were highly valued, though not expected.  Presenting at conferences was (and still is) an acceptable form of scholarship.  Things are changing some at my institution and across the nation (U.S.) as well.  Fortunately, there are more ways to get published (online journals, for example).    I've had two peer-reviewed publications and have submitted 3-5 other papers that were not accepted.  The referees provided helpful feedback that I just didn't have the time (sometimes it was lack of energy) to rewrite.  I certainly could have done more.  In fact, I have some stuff I'm hoping to submit for publication within the next year.    At a small institution, you'll be expected to serve on campus-wide committees, which I've enjoyed (as much as one can enjoy going to meetings) because I've gotten to know people from other disciplines.  My school gets good students, but as a rule, they're not the kind who will set the world on fire.  However, it's the students who make it for me.  For instance, this past year, I supervised a student presentation for an average-to-good student who was generally quiet.  Her presentation was exceptional, though, and I was so proud of her and how well she did.  That's one of the joys of my job.    If this is the type of career you want, look into the Preparing Future Faculty program.  It matches students in graduate programs with faculty members at other local institutions.  You can make of it what you want.     Good luck with your decision!  In general, I enjoy teaching any course I am given, be it our most elementary or most advanced.    Edit:  missing words"
math,3c112o,ColdStainlessNail,10,Sat Jul 4 01:38:28 2015 UTC,"I teach at a liberal arts college, and have chaired the Math department there for several years.  The college is small, with fewer than 3000 undergraduate students.  If it is of interest, my BS and MS degrees were in applied mathematics, I worked in industry for a short time before entering my doctoral program, and my PhD work was in PDEs (symmetry theory).  I now work on aspects of nonlinear regression related to ecological models involving nonlinear PDEs (this is often translated for non-math colleagues as ""he's really good with data"", so I often describe myself as a data scientist working in ecology).  Before I landed in my current position, I worked one- or two-year visiting positions at three institutions, one (very famous) liberal arts college and two R1 institutions (who did not hire me in those one-year positions for my research).  As a note: I aimed at teaching at a liberal arts college rather than an R1, so this was not a consolation prize for me.  I'm not sure what information you would like about the liberal arts career path; feel free to ask questions (and keep in mind it is a holiday weekend and Reddit is apparently imploding, so I'm not sure when I'll reply).  I'll provide a few pros, cons, and thoughts, but this will be fairly incomplete.  Thoughts on preparing to teach at a small liberal arts college:  You can't, really.  This is a skill learned primarily through experience.  You need to have good teaching skills, yes, but you need to be able to work with a wide range of students in a wide range of scenarios.  You need to develop good people skills.  For example, you may end up working on a committee with a business calc student you gave a D to last semester.  This guy is nineteen years old.  It's up to you to establish the relationship going forward so that the committee isn't awkward.  I regularly give students D's or F's with the expectation that I will absolutely have to work with them again, in class or outside of it; the joys of the small college campus.  One thing that seems to be common: I have several colleagues who have changed research interests completely, or have a second student-friendly research interest.  The vast majority of undergraduates don't have the background to hack away at most research problems in mathematics.  Our undergrads will often complete Calc III and Differential Equations in their sophomore year; how does someone working in the symmetry theory of PDEs bring someone with little formal background and no course work in algebra, geometry, analysis, topology, or PDEs up to speed in two years and have them solve a real, actual problem...while that student is ALSO trying to fill out the full slate of courses he/she needs to complete the undergraduate degree?  It's a pretty ridiculous proposition.  So, to establish a good working relationship with math majors for undergraduate research/capstone course projects/etc., you often need to adjust your interests to something they can approach.  Okay, thoughts on good points of teaching math at a liberal arts college:   Generally my students at liberal arts colleges have been very nice.  Not always the sharpest knives in the drawer (some exceptional exceptions), but nice people to work with.  I had some outrageously awful students at R1 universities, in all sorts of ways. You have a lot more freedom to adapt your research to your evolving interests and the needs of your students.  Many liberal arts colleges adhere to a modified Boyer model of scholarship, in which the scholarship of teaching or application can play a big role. You have a lot of freedom and opportunity to work with colleagues and students in interdisciplinary settings.  I have advised or co-advised undergraduate research projects in math, physics, economics, and biology (and it looks like there is a serious poli sci project coming up next spring). You will have some significant opportunities to affect the development of your department and institution.  When I started teaching at my current institution, I was one of four full-time faculty in Math, and one of only fourteen in the science division.    And some bad points:   Thinking of the tenure triad - scholarship, service, teaching - a lot of weight tends to be given to teaching and service, but if you are not careful, scholarship can become a weekend/summer endeavor.  Expectations on teaching and service are rarely clearly spelled out, with the hope that faculty will put in tons of extra time. Promotion and tenure can be weird and random.  The promotion and tenure committee is typically made up of faculty and an admin or two... but with such a small faculty, it is likely that no one in your committee will be Math faculty, or even science faculty (that is the current situation at my institution). You have to find fulfillment in teaching at all levels.  I typically teach one course a year to math/physics majors, and the other five are to non-majors, usually not science (I tend to have good relationships with students outside the sciences, so I end up teaching a lot of business calc, intro stats, etc.).  Similarly, you have to find fulfillment in advising students in many majors, not just math.  Depending on the needs of the student population, and the needs of the junior faculty with respect to their teaching development, I might easily go two years without teaching a math-major-specific course. There is a LOT of administrative crap to be done.  In a small department, you will almost certainly be the chair at some point, so brace yourself.   To summarize: Faculty positions at a small liberal arts college are MUCH more about teaching and advising, and MUCH less about research.  In a way, I find the position oddly similar to working in industry, except that my customers are nicer, my colleagues are nicer and less backstabby, and I only really work four days a week on campus, eight months a year (oh, and the pay sucks in comparison).  Feel free to fire off questions; I might not be able to answer until Sunday due to a hike tomorrow."

Teaching math at a liberal arts school is mostly about teaching, not research. Even the full professor in the department focused primarily on teaching upper-level courses and independent studies for math majors.  Most teachers are either graduate students (often at other universities) or people with Master's degrees, and most of the classes they teach are for general education requirements or specific applications (e.g. math for business). If the university has a dedicated mathematics major (many don't), then there will usually be at least one professor with a PhD who teaches those students. Students get a lot more one-on-one time with professors, but they are limited in what they can study based on the professor's background.   Anyway, the actual teaching was fine, but it was for mostly non-math people, so there were a lot of bored and bewildered students. They had a particularly difficult semester because they had to change teachers in the last third of the semester. In terms of preparation, I'd say to try getting a teaching assistantship or lecturing experience before you're completely on your own so you know what to expect."

A ""liberal arts degree"" can be used in two senses: 1) you got a degree in the humanities, soft science, etc., or 2) you got a degree from a college that encourages broad general knowledge and/or focuses mainly on undergraduate education. The point is that all these terms aren't really defined so clearly."

math,3c112o,camelbutt,3,Sat Jul 4 06:59:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry if the formatting is weird. I'm on mobile.   I went to a very small private liberal arts college in California and unfortunately only got a few professors' full stories.   One had a master's from a public university and held an adjunct position. She worked at my college for my junior and senior years and was given more and more classes to teach every semester once she had proven her capacity to succeed. However, she never got classes past Calculus because she only had a Master's.   One professor had done lots of research in his life and had traveled all over the world to collaborate with other mathematicians before taking the position. He taught at my college during the semester and continued to do research over the summer. He came to us with a phd from Harvard if I'm not mistaken. He got tenure during my junior year and spent his sabbatical doing research with professors out of state.    One professor was hired while I was there and the hiring process basically entailed an application, multiple interviews, a lunch meeting with students and guest teaching for a few of our classes. After a year of teaching, he was one of the lead instructors for our senior seminar and taught both lower level and higher level math. He came to us with a phd from UCLA.   I don't know if my experience was out of the ordinary or not, but our professors always taught us with the intention of teaching mathematics.  Many of them did their own research in addition to teaching or wrote books. Many of them collaborated with students and other professors for publications and research. They often also collaborated with professors in other departments to combine math with other subjects or to manage our senior thesis class.  We were never taught by grad students or TA's and every professor knew every student and every student knew every professor, from their background to their academic focus to their hobbies.   I hope this answers your question to some extent :)"

But let me tell you, this, I learned a hell of a lot more about math and work ethics from attending this small school with a very small math department than I ever would have at MIT and for that I am grateful. I can post some of my past papers here for proof if anyone wants it, most of the really hard exams were take home but some were equally hard and in class as well.

The student quality has high variance, especially when admissions is willing to lower the bar for students who can pay full tuition. I made the leap to a top ranked phd in economics from my top 100 LAC. I was waitlisted at an Ivy during the undergrad admissions process. However, the math major at a LAC tends to attract both those interested in abstract mathematics and quantitative sciences, as well as high school education majors with little interest in upper level electives.

Moving from Hungry to Switzerland, for example, there will be a negligible amount of Hungarian speakers so you will have to communicate 100% in a foreign language.

We obviousely can't infer from your willingness to change your place ever so often to that of other EU citizen. I could even attribute this to Québec French culture being surrounded by anglo americans and all but this is a very bold suggestion.  And also I think you know french and english (which you probably learned in school) and you have lived in the USA, UK and Switzerland all three countries which use either use English or French (which you already know).

It states the correct UK average of £27k but then quotes the teacher's average as only £22k. Somehow, +£5k has been interpreted down to -£5k. Either that, or it's a typo and 22 should have been 32.

While I agree that practicing a lot does help in math, attitude is always a big factor in it. If you don't want to learn math, you're not going to.   For a lot of mathematical concepts, it depends on how the teacher/Professor explains the concepts as well."

At the same time, I also study computer science so I know about the issue in software development about the myth of a genius programmer. While the context is different, it would not surprise me that even in math the push not to seem like the dumb one when working in a collaborative environment seeps out in this way. No one likes to let less than their best show.   To contrast however, there is less of this visible progress in the context of math. Unless asked, the behind-the-scenes effort will remain as such. I'd like you to clarify what you mean by gloss over the hard work.

While true for being the BEST at something (e.g., just practicing a lot isn't enough to win an Olympic gold medal, you need to have genetic advantages at least on par with other contenders), I don't think this is true for becoming good at something.  Barring an actual medical disability I think just about everyone can ""get"" math (or physics, or chemistry, or any other topic they choose to study) up to pretty much any level they choose to study, if they put in sufficient time and effort.  Now, that's not to say everybody SHOULD put in that much effort to study math - there are many worthwhile endeavors, many of which will more directly improve your quality of life more than studying additional math.  But I don't think it's correct to just say ""well if you don't get math that's okay because you're just fundamentally unable to learn it"" - that's like saying ""it's okay you're illiterate, because you probably don't possess the capacity to learn how to read""  - again, there are actual medical issues, like blindness or severe dyslexia, that can interfere with the ability of a person to learn to read, but those kinds of problem are not the cause of ""math-badness"" for the vast majority of people."

I was suggesting the similar statement of ""Well if you don't get math, that's okay because you just didn't try hard enough"" is something most shouldn't live by. If you're failing in uni at math, there's probably a good reason why and I would bet it's usually that the person isn't cut out for math.  edit: to be clear, by the last statement I mean if you're majoring in math and don't succeed."
math,3c4rsq,austinpowersruled,3,Sat Jul 4 20:15:42 2015 UTC,"""Well if you don't get math, that's okay because you just didn't try hard enough""   I tutored math and physics for a while and when a student ""didn't get it"" for some topic, the problem was almost invariably related to not putting in enough effort.  Sometimes they were working hard now but hadn't in the past (so they missed foundational concepts they needed a strong grasp of now, and we had to go back and re-learn some earlier topics) and sometimes they just weren't working hard now - e.g., allocating an hour per night for math homework but spending 2/3 of that browsing the web, then getting answers for the problems from the key because they were ""too hard"".  Now, am I saying that every high school student is well-suited to become a math professor at Harvard?  No, I'm not (again, like medalling in the Olympics, you need some other advantages/luck to get that kind of position).  But for people who say ""I'm bad at math"" because they're floundering in algebra/geometry/calculus/whatever, I think it usually is because they didn't try hard enough (either now or in the past), and with a judicious application of effort it's typically fixable.  edit:  also, to be clear, when I say ""didn't try hard enough"" here, that isn't meant to cast all the blame on the person studying.  It's partly the job of their teachers and parents to make sure that students put in the necessary effort, and a bad teacher can completely kill an otherwise-motivated student's desire to learn (or they can be distracted by personal issues, or other courses they focus on more, whatever).  So it's not really meant as a value judgment ""why didn't you bother learning this"" because there are often other factors in play, but it ultimately comes down to ""you didn't put in the time/effort to understand this before, so if you want to understand it now, you need to put in some effort."""
math,3c4rsq,trickyben2,0,Sat Jul 4 20:26:58 2015 UTC,"I understood what you meant by ""didn't try hard enough."" And I agree there are people who didn't try hard enough in the past and can put the effort in to become good at math (I fall under this category). I don't think I'm being clear, though. My point is that it doesn't just take practice and putting in time to be good at math. And I find it can be harmful to tell people this--I've seen many people crash and burn because they lived by this. It's similar to the lie that you can be anything you want--this just simply isn't reality. Each person is predisposed to being bad or good at certain things and sometimes you have to accept that and move on."
math,3c1fvn,Dinstruction,7,Fri Jul 3 21:52:07 2015 UTC,"I think my experience might be somewhat helpful for you, although we aren't exactly in the same shoes.  I went to a well-known liberal arts college, but my grades were significantly worse than yours (~3.4 overall, more like 3.6 in math). Like you, I took all of the math classes, did some independent study, and went to Math in Moscow. I did one summer of research (at my school), for which the paper is still waiting for a response. I did no REUs. My GRE scores were not wonderful, I think ~65th percentile, but my letter-writers (all from my school, which may have been a mistake) knew me very well, and I am certain the letters were all very strong.  I was rejected from nearly every school I applied to, and I applied to a very broad list, ranging from ""this is impossible but i'll feel bad if i don't apply just in case"" to ""if this school does not admit me, I'll need to completely reconsider my understanding of myself as a person who studies math"". Fortunately, the latter school admitted me. I was admitted to another school with little respect as a grad program, but was not offered funding.  I think most of the schools I applied to were in the ~20-50 range, but I also don't have a particularly good sense of exactly the appropriate way to look at rankings, especially since area of specialization is so important, and so variable across schools. Anyhow, I was (somehow) admitted off a waitlist at a relatively good (at least by my standards) program, and that's where I've ended up. I did not feel underprepared for the program---in fact, my grades here are dramatically better than they were in undergrad---but that is unfortunately not a terribly important factor. What seems to matter much more is your ability to sell the program you apply to on why they should pay you when there is a significant risk associated with coming from somewhere nobody has heard of. I was extremely fortunate that my letter-writers knew some of the faculty I was interested in working with. It would very much be worth asking yours if there are people they have met or collaborated with at any of the schools you are applying to, because that is a very good way to help tilt your application. If someone on the committee reads a familiar name, that can absolutely alleviate some of the difficulty from coming from an unknown school.  Your REUs are also going to be a huge benefit to you, because at least in theory they show that someone else (especially the second one, at the school you're thinking of applying to) thinks you're capable of doing research.  One last piece of advice: get really fucking good at integrating quickly before the GRE. That is by far the biggest part of that exam."

Several friends of mine have gotten admission into a top 10 program via a letter of recommendation from a faculty member they worked with there during an REU.  Now, having said that, it will be more difficult for you to crack the top 10 given that you didn't go to a research university for undergrad, but it's not impossible.  Do well on your GRE subject tests.  Get good letters of recommendation.  Publish if you can.  Take writing your statement of purpose very seriously.  In particular, if you can, read papers from faculty at each university you apply and try to see how their research interests might fit your own; mention this in your statement of purpose.

I understand that you are at a disadvantage, but unless they were in the same position as you the admittance committee really won't be able to quantify how much harder you've had to work than everyone else.

Some admissions officers are looking for more than a mere summary of your coursework and research experience. They want to hear the applicant's voice, journey, and struggles so they can understand the applicant as someone more than just a transcript and a resume. I was at a graduate school panel for my REU, and the director of admissions says that he doesn't get enthusiastic about personal statements along the lines of ""I won X award, then I did an REU and published this paper, and I want to study Y under professor Z because math is fun and cool please let me in.""

Get a letter from the current REU organizer (is it a regular professor, or is it a postdoc?) and from the Math in Moscow instructor (do you really only have one choice from there when you should have taken a couple of courses?).  Get one letter from a professor at your school, if only because none at all may seem a bit odd. But just get one of those.  Realistically, the top programs may be reluctant to take someone from a program they have no familiarity with. When a professor from an unknown department says ""this is the best student we've seen in 25 years,"" it may not mean very much to faculty in top programs because the best in 25 years at a no-name school doesn't have to be really good. They also do not want to admit someone who will be completely overwhelmed at their program.  Apply to a few top programs, but getting admitted to them is probably a long shot if your school is as obscure as you suggest, so keep the bulk of your applications within a more realistic range. Good luck."

The way to look at this is to see that if you line up blocks of with 1 with heights 1, 1/2, 1/3 all the way out to 1/N, then you get something that is larger than the area under the curve 1/(1+x) from x=0 to N, draw both of them out and see.

The configuration space of mechanical linkages is often used as a basic example of a manifold, and then you can answer any of your questions by examining geometric/topological properties of the configuration space. Some of the difficulty is probably in finding a useful description of the space, though.  For example, in the case of disentanglement puzzles, you can describe the configuration of each piece as a position and orientation. To get the full configuration space, take the product of all of those and remove any points that correspond to two pieces intersecting. (For the purposes of modeling, you can often treat the pieces as being built from 1-dimensional 'wires', hence this construction involves removing some lower-dimensional submanifold.) Then the question of solvability is reduced to the existence of a path between two particular points in configuration space, one corresponding to the initial state of the puzzle, one to the solved state. But I don't know that answering that question is any easier than finding a path, i.e. solving the puzzle."

However, let's say all teams are playing g games and team i has currently won W_i and lost L_i games. They will end the season with Wf_i and Lf_i (wins final/losses final).  If the team in 15th place has lost L games (Assuming all teams have played the same number of games, so all teams behind 15th have lost at least as many games), then any team can guarantee themselves a top 15 finish by guaranteeing that they lose fewer than L games.  Lf_i + Wf_i = G Lf_i < L Lf_i = G-Wf_i G - Wf_i < L G - L < Wf_i  So, the team needs to win G-L+1 games and has already won W_i, thus the magic number is G-L+1-W_i = (G+1)-(L + W_i).  Which basically is another way of saying ""The wins for your team plus the losses for the team 1 place outside of the playoffs need to be greater than the total number of games in the season."" Usually a win for you or a loss for a team on the bubble lowers your magic number by one. The exception being if there's a team with the same number of losses as the team in 15th.  Now, there are times when this isn't quite accurate. Imagine two teams are tied for 14th/15th and are both far ahead of 16th place. One of these teams is going to lose some games and make 15th place have more losses, so your magic number is actually lower.  This is a quick and dirty method, but it will never tell you that a team has qualified when they haven't. It's also the same version MLB uses for their magic numbers."

Solving Schanuel's conjecture, the most important open problem in transcendental number theory, would imply that the theory of algebraically closed fields with exponentiation is decidable.

But I haven't tried to actually work anything out here, or prove that this makes sense; just going with my gut. What we need is an analogue of the normal bundle and a normal bundle map to go with it.  Let's suppose S is a codimension 1 submanifold of a Riemannian manifold M. At each point p the tangent space to S has an orthogonal complement in the tangent space to M, so we'll call that the normal space at p; then we can build the normal bundle of S.  To create the normal bundle map, we need an analogue of vector addition, and I think the one that captures the same spirit is h(p, v) = phi(p, v; 1), where phi(p, v; t) is the unique geodesic with phi(p, v; 0) = p and phi'(p, v; 0) = v.  Now we have a normal bundle NS and a map NS -> M, so you can define the focal points to be the critical values of this map.  edit: Beaten to the punch by eruonna."

A vector space is a set (group?, I don't know the formal terminology) where the following are true:   The dot product, scalar multiplication and vector addition exist for all vectors in the set.

Other than that, your definition is okay: a vector space is a set with addition and scalar multiplication. It's important to note that the operations need to follow special laws(the set has to be a group under addition, and scalar multiplication is commutative, associative and distributive, and I think I'm not missing anything), but you probably knew that when calling them ""addition"" and ""scalar multiplication"".  Intuitively, a vector space is a set of things that act like the vectors in Rn you had in high school(you actually used mostly vectors in R3 , so just triples of numbers): you can add them with each other, and you can multiply them by scalars. The problem with the vectors you used in high school is that there are lots of ways of representing things as vectors in Rn : if we are modeling, say, the forces acting on a planet, it really does not matter which direction is (1;0;0), which one is (0;1;0), and which one is (0;0;1), and actually you'll probably want to use different representations for different things.  In high school we just glossed over that problem, and said that forces were the triples of numbers: now, we say that forces form a vector space, and to do calculations we find a basis that gives us our coordinates. Another advantage of this approach is that we can use the same theory to talk about things that do act like vectors, but can't be given coordinates just like that, like functions: functions on R are a vector space because you can multiply them by scalars and add them, but unless you choose specific functions, you can't just represent them with coordinates, and even then you will have an infinite number of dimensions"

math,3c06n2,UseTheSubjunctive,3,Fri Jul 3 21:00:23 2015 UTC,It works for any digit. Here's why:  First we count the number of n-digit numbers that are missing a particular digit. There are 8(9n-1) such numbers since we have 9 digits to choose from and the first digit can't be 0. Note that because these are n-digit numbers then each number is greater than 10n-1 (which means that the reciprocal is less than 1/10n-1).  So our series is bounded above by 8(1 + 9/10 + (9/10)2 + ...). This series is a geometric series with ratio r < 1 so it converges. By the comparison test this means that our modified harmonic series also converges.

math,3bzjyd,ChezMere,5,Fri Jul 3 13:14:39 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm missing something but how does that really answer OPs question about the existence of a sequence F_m?
math,3bzjyd,tux_hippo,10,Fri Jul 3 13:30:12 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm missing what you are saying, since there is no boundary between convergent and non convergent series, then F_M doesn't exist, evenly asymptotically as he specified"
math,3bzjyd,minime12358,3,Fri Jul 3 14:05:26 2015 UTC,"I mean, if a series can converge to any value, you're basically asking for the largest finite number."
math,3bzjyd,EyyEyyMVP_EyyEyyMVP,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:19:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's different it's not the same problem since I want the elements to become greater than another's at some point, I don't want the sum to become greater.  Also if that was the same problem, then the answer would be Yes, but it's a No as /u/noetherian3 proved. If  (F_m) summed to 1,2,3,... then for any series sum A, there's a point past which the sum of F_m becomes greater than A."
math,3bzjyd,minime12358,5,Fri Jul 3 22:12:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is what you mean, but if you take any series that converges to a positive value, you can find a better series by multiplying each element by any number greater than one."
math,3bzjyd,EyyEyyMVP_EyyEyyMVP,4,Fri Jul 3 13:07:45 2015 UTC,"That's true but not very helful. Take e-n for example. 8e-n is better than e-n, but it is not better than n-2."
math,3bzjyd,dance1211,6,Fri Jul 3 13:11:06 2015 UTC,"It is helpful, though. For any candidate function, f(n), c f(n) is better. Which very quickly proves non existence"
math,3bzjyd,chebushka,6,Fri Jul 3 14:07:08 2015 UTC,F is a sequence of series. [;F_m;] is a series.  [;F_m (n);] is a number. Sorry for any confusion.
math,3bzjyd,dance1211,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:16:44 2015 UTC,"No. If f_m (n) = n-1-1/m , then no constant multiple of some fixed f_m is better than every element in the set of {f_m}s, even though the sum of each f_m converges."
math,3bzjyd,W_T_Jones,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:15:37 2015 UTC,"I did misread the question, but m acts as a constant in that, so multiplying by any function of m would achieve the same result.  Regardless, is there a function in between your sequence and a divergent one?"
math,3bzjyd,chebushka,2,Fri Jul 3 19:18:00 2015 UTC,"so multiplying by any function of m would achieve the same result.   The (negation of the) question was if there's always a single series that's better than the supremum of a sequence of series. The point was that for every c and m' you pick, if you go far enough into this sequence of {f_m}s then at least one of them will be bigger than c f_m'.   Regardless, is there a function in between your sequence and a divergent one?   Replacing m with ""log(log(n))"" (so f(n) = n1-1/log log n), we get a single series that's better than every fixed f_m but also converges."
math,3bzjyd,noahkubbs,3,Fri Jul 3 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"Let's consider a converging series X such that X = x0 + x_1 + x_2 + ... where x_0 > x_1 > x_2 > ... > 0 . Now also consider the series Y = y_0 + y_1 + y_2 + ... where y_n = (x_n + x(n+1) )/2. What this allows is for x_0 > y_0 > x_1 > y_1 > ... . Adding these 2 series together creates a new converging series X+Y which is both decreasing and positive. If we repeat this method of creating a new series by adding another series of averages, we can theoretically make a series which decreases incredibly slowly yet still converges. Repeating this towards infinite times creates a converging sequence that, if plotted, will look like a straight horizontal line. (Where the x axis is n and the y axis is the respective term of the series) We can also decide where this line starts by simply choosing the first term to be this value. An example is the series A = a + a/2 + a/4 + a/8 + ... which converges to 2a. Applying the method on this series give another series in which the terms decrease so slowly that they do not go down.  If we now assume that there is a series F = f_0 + f_1 + f_2 + ... where the terms of the question then we can use the above to create a series X = x_0 + x_1 + ... where f_0 > x_0 > f_1. This series X can decrease so slowly that x_1 > f_1, x_2 > f_2 and so on so there wont be any m for which f_m > x_m. This is a contradiction so the series F doesn't exist."

It's much easier to find injections P(N) → R and R → P(N) and then appeal to the Schröder–Bernstein theorem to get there is a bijection between them. One could unravel a proof of Schröder–Bernstein and apply it to two explicit injections to get an explicit bijection, but that's tedious and doesn't provide any useful insight."

math,3c0fvl,bowtochris,3,Sat Jul 4 00:05:20 2015 UTC,That function f is not well defined. f(N) will not converge. It will work if instead you send a subset S of N to the trinary expansion whose nth digit is 1 if n is in S and is 0 otherwise.

math,3c0fvl,ENelligan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:15:18 2015 UTC,"Indeed, that's why I was careful to say surjective, so this is almost the solution, you just gotta do something else to get it exactly right if that's important to you (which it shouldn't be if you just want the intuition)."
math,3c0fvl,wgunther,3,Fri Jul 3 20:23:40 2015 UTC,"Take a subset of the naturals.  Consider the elements of the subset in ascending order.  Subtract successive elements to get a sequence of positive naturals.  Use this sequence in a continued fraction.  That will give you a bijection between P(N) and R+.    You can set up a bijection betwee P(N) and (P(N) x Bool).  Use presence of 0 in the subset as the boolean, and map all n in the subset to n-1.  Using these two bijections, you can make a bijection between P(N) and the union of R+ and R-, leaving 0.    You can always define a bijection between an infinite set A and the union of A and a finite set B with cardinality k.  Define a countably infinite sequence of distinct elements of A, called ai .  Map b1 through bn in the union to a1 through an, and map ai in the union to ai+k in A by itself.  Combining these bijections, you have a bijection between the power set of naturals and the real numbers."
math,3c0fvl,frud,2,Fri Jul 3 18:39:28 2015 UTC,A lot of this could be simplified away: use the log function as a bijection from R+ to R.
math,3c0fvl,isosum,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:51:04 2015 UTC,"If we subtract successive terms, both {1,2,3,4} & {2,3,4,5} map to 3/2 (subtracting successive terms, both equal {1,1,1}). Additionally, {1,2,4} (=>{1,2}) also maps to 3/2 because every rational has more than one (2 IIRC) representations as a continued fraction   Example: 3/2=1+(1/1+(1/1))=1+1/2 Hence 3/2={1,1,1}={1,2}.  Hence every rational has atleast 2 representations, {a1,a2,...,an} and {a1,a2,...,an-1,1}  So, did I interpret ""subtract successive elements"" incorrectly? Even so, how does this overcome the fact that each rational has 2 representations?"
math,3c0fvl,frud,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:29:10 2015 UTC,"I put it wrongly.  I meant {5,6,8,9,11...} to map to the continued fraction [5; 1,2,1,2...].  The smallest integer in the set is the floor of the real number, and take the intervals of the rest of the elements to be the continued fraction portion.  Now that I think back on it, I think I haven't handled 0 correctly.  I guess it's not correct as it is, but salvageable."
math,3c0fvl,frud,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:34:03 2015 UTC,"{5,6,7} & {5,7} are distinct elements of P(N). They should have different images.   Image of {5,6,7}=[5; 1,1]=5+(1/2)  Image of {5,7}=[5; 2]=5+(1/2). So it isn't injective.   Assume f is a bijection P(N)->R+. Let g(x)=ln(x). g is a bijection R+->R. Hence g(f(x)) is a bijection from P(N)->R.   Just for fun: [5; 1,2,1,2,...]=4+(3½)  The problems appearing in the discussions so far are the same. Unique representation for numbers are hard to find."
math,3c0fvl,ThisIsMyOkCAccount,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:58:17 2015 UTC,"That's true.  But then again, you can always wallpaper over a countable number of errors.  Ain't infinity grand?"
math,3c0fvl,wgunther,3,Wed Jul 8 22:15:26 2015 UTC,"Edit: There are some issues with my idea. You should use the Shroeder-Bernstein Theorem.  Every real number between 0 and 1 can be written as a binary number with either a finite or infinite expansion that might repeat or not repeat, for instance these are real numbers  .00111111010000110  .0101...  This representation is unique.  Edit: The representation isn't quite unique. Numbers with terminating representations can also be represented with an infinite string of ones at the end, for example .01= .0011111111... But if you only consider the finite representation in this case, then it's unique.  This gives us a bijection f between the interval (0, 1) and the power set of the natural numbers if we let f send a real number to a subset of natural numbers such that n is in f(x) if and only if the nth place in the binary expansion of x is 1.  Now, we can use a couple other easy bijections to map (0, 1) onto (-pi/2, pi/2) and then tangent bijectively maps that interval onto all of the real numbers. The composition of a bijection and a bijection is a bijection, so this gives us our mapping."
math,3c0fvl,ThisIsMyOkCAccount,9,Fri Jul 3 17:34:31 2015 UTC,"This representation is unique.   That is not true, which gives some difficulty for writing an explicit bijection. For instance, .01111... is the same as .1000..."
math,3c0fvl,wgunther,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:37:25 2015 UTC,"Totally right. Thank you. For some reason I had myself convinced this wasn't an issue in binary.  The representation is unique if you throw out the ones with repeated ones, though."
math,3c0fvl,completely-ineffable,3,Fri Jul 3 17:41:20 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not an issue if you read the number in decimal (or even ternary) but just use 0's and 1's. This gives you an injection from binary sequences to (0,1). Maybe that's what you were thinking. Then, that would actually help you if you wanted to get a bijection with Cantor-Shroeder-Bernstein (which is actually constructive) since getting an injection from (0,1) to infinite binary sequence is easy (like you said, choose the representation that doesn't end in all 1's if you ever have a choice)."
math,3c0fvl,ThisIsMyOkCAccount,3,Fri Jul 3 17:45:51 2015 UTC,"To get all of the powerset of N in the range of your mapping, N would have to be the image of 1 = 0.111... and the empty set would have to be the image of 0 = 0.000... That is, the domain would have to be [0,1], not (0,1).   Numbers with terminating representations can also be represented with an infinite string of ones at the end, for example .01= .0011111111... But if you only consider the finite representation in this case, then it's unique.  This gives us a bijection f between the interval (0, 1) and the power set of the natural numbers if we let f send a real number to a subset of natural numbers such that n is in f(x) if and only if the nth place in the binary expansion of x is 1.   If you restrict to only the finite representation, then you don't get that the map is onto P(N). For example, the number 0.1 = 0.0111... gets mapped to the set {1} and nothing gets mapped to the set N \ {1}."
math,3c0fvl,completely-ineffable,3,Fri Jul 3 17:48:07 2015 UTC,Well I'm glad I posted this if only so people could tell me about the mistakes I made with it. Better to get corrected than continue thinking I'm right.
math,3c0fvl,ThisIsMyOkCAccount,3,Fri Jul 3 17:53:21 2015 UTC,"As I mention in my top-level comment here, finding explicit bijections can be tricky.  On the other hand, finding explicit injections is usually much easier, and the Schröder–Bernstein theorem allows us to deduce the existence of a bijection between two sets if there are injections going in both directions."
math,3c0fvl,avoiding_my_thesis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:56:27 2015 UTC,"I know about the Shroder-Bernstein Theorem. I've used it before in, for example, proving that the unit segment and the unit square have the same cardinality. I just goofed on this."
math,3c0zwr,Mysticalsquirrel,14,Fri Jul 3 19:45:31 2015 UTC,"I am assuming that by    use Stoke's Theorem twice   you mean    use Stokes' Theorem to pass from a surface integral to a line integral, and then use Stokes' Theorem again to pass from the line integral to a different surface integral   Stokes' theorem (at least the thing called Stokes' Theorem in a standard calc course1 ) refers to a surface with a boundary that is a closed curve. Note that in 2-d space, a closed curve bounds a specific region. In order to have multiple different surfaces share the same boundary curve, that curve needs to lie in a space of higher dimension.  Similarly, the divergence theorem refers to volumes in 3-space that are bounded by closed surfaces. In order for a closed surface to bound different regions, that surface would need to sit in 4-d space or higher.   Now you aren't meant to be able to ""see"" what that is supposed to mean. Most people aren't capable of ""seeing"" 4-d pictures, and those that are have likely trained themselves to understand moving 3-d pictures in a very particular way. The good news is that you probably don't need to ""see"" anything. You're meant to use the intuition from the surface/curve case - the 3rd dimension allows both the curve and, more importantly, the surface to wiggle - to understand that the extra 4th dimension allows volumes to wiggle.  Now here's something that'll really bake your noodle ...   The plane figures that you learned about in high school geometry - circles, polygons, etc - are ""flat"" 2-d objects. The regions bounded by curves that you studied in single-variable calc are also, since they live in 2-d space, ""flat"". The standard name for ""2-d object"" is surface. There are more interesting ""not-flat"" surfaces, but we need a third dimension to get them. Now with that said, all of the volumes (3-d objects) that you've ever experienced lie in 3-space, and are therefore ""flat"" in some regard - they have the same dimension as the space they live in. So my question is, what does a ""not-flat"" volume ""look like""?  1 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Green's Theorem, Stokes' Theorem (calc-class version), and the Divergence Theorem are all special cases of the ""real"" Stokes' Theorem, which relates integrals over regions to integrals over their boundaries in arbitrary n-space.  Edited for spelling and clarity"
math,3c0zwr,gopher_p,2,Fri Jul 3 21:26:13 2015 UTC,"My professor told us that Green's is just Stokes' in 2d but I never thought that they ALL were just variations of the real Stokes' Theorem! Woah... It's amazing how so many things can come from just one idea.    Now with that said, all of the volumes (3-d objects) that you've ever experienced lie in 3-space, and are therefore ""flat"" in some regard - they have the same dimension as the space they live in. So my question is, what does a ""not-flat"" volume ""look like""?      Now I can't answer this because if I say sphere it's still flat because it's just a circle in 3 space that is ""flat in some regard"" so now... I'm going to have to think about this. I can't really see a non flat volume graphically? Is that what you are saying? This is all really interesting by the way, thank you for explaining!"
math,3c0zwr,bananasluggers,2,Sat Jul 4 04:38:54 2015 UTC,"You can visualize higher dimensions by looking at many different slices in a smaller dimension. For example, if you could only see 2D pictures, I could describe a cone to you by telling you that at coordinate z=t (0<=t<1), the figure is a circle with radius t-1 centered at the origin, just the origin at z=1, and the figure doesn't touch any other slice.  So the z=0 slice is a circle of radius 1, the z=0.5 slice is a circle of radius 0.5 and the z=1 slice is a point. In this way, two dimensional figures stack up to allow you to visualize 3D.  In the same way, you can visualize an object in 4D. For example, at coordinate w=t (0<=t<1), it is the surface of a sphere of radius t centered at the origin. Then it is just the origin at w=1, and the 3D slice is empty at all other values of w. This is a hollow cone living in the fourth dimension. Its boundary is the sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin, in the w=0 slice.  The filled, solid sphere of radius 1 also has the same boundary. So you could use the divergence theorem pass from a divergence calculation on this solid sphere to a flux integral calculation on its boundary, and then to a divergence integral on the hollow cone in 4-space."

math,3c1gbs,LilFinger,7,Fri Jul 3 21:56:03 2015 UTC,"The floor function at positive nonintegers can be written as a vertical contour integral involving the Riemann zeta function.  Look up Perron's formula and set the Dirichlet series coefficients equal to 1. Alas, since this formula uses the zeta function, not its logarithmic derivative, you will not pick up terms involving zeros of the zeta function if push the contour to the left and use the residue theorem.  The reason there are zeros of the zeta function in the prime counting formula is that the formula is related to the logarithmic derivative of the zeta function rather than the zeta function: poles of f'(s)/f(s) are the zeros and poles of f(s). The residue theorem provides information from poles of what you integrate, not zeros from what you integrate."

math,3c0tcs,PermaNulled,3,Fri Jul 3 18:55:33 2015 UTC,"A linear congruential PRNG usually operates at a bit depth that is higher than the output bit depth, so for example if it was producing 16-bit numbers, internally it would be performing the algorithm on 32-bit numbers, and then it throws away the bottom 16-bits (which iirc are less random), and returns the top 16-bits.    If I remember right, it does this in a few places in the algorithm, this is data loss when you are trying to reverse it, you cannot know what values it threw away, and so an LC PRNG is usually reversed by brute forcing all the possible lower bits it could have thrown away until you match enough of the lost data that you have a full set of (shift) registers (*which in a computer is just some bits called the state).  Then the PRNG is solved and you can predict all the numbers that will come out of it afterwards.  Another way to crack it is to know the seed, and a weird example of that is a PRNG cracker that gets you to enter a specific date and time into your Nintendo DS (which gets used as part of the PRNG seed) in Pokémon games, and allows people to encounter Pokémon with ""perfect"" stats for tournament play.

math,3bz5nf,FilipinosRich,13,Fri Jul 3 09:35:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know exactly what a Belgian highschool graduate should know about mathematics, but I shall make the foolish assumption that it must be fairly similar to an A-level students standard in the UK, as you are progressing to university (and A-levels are the qualifying courses for university study in the UK)  Thus, I presume you've learned calculus of a single variable, trigonometry, elementary algebra (i.e., binomial expansions etc.), something on sequences and series (and maybe applications, such as Newton-Raphson, and Fixed-Point iteration), and some statistics and mechanics.  Pure mathematics at university is certainly very different to what I just listed. Though what you will learn is often connected to that sort of stuff. In your first year of university, you are very likely (in the UK at least) to have first courses in Analysis and Algebra.  Analysis is essentially calculus, done properly. Old books on introductory analysis are frequently called ""The Theory of Functions of a Real Variable"", or something similar, but it highlights what a first course in Analysis will be. I would think, for the pedagogical ease, that you would have been taught integration as the inverse of differentiation, with the idea that integrals are actually sums in some sense as an aside. A proper course will define the integral in its own right, and then prove that, under the right conditions, that integration and differentiation are inverse processes.   That's the key word for pure mathematics; proof. You will be much less concerned with computational problems (which I imagine dominated your previous courses), and instead will be asked to prove that you get certain consequences from given hypotheses. For instance, that any continuous function on a closed set [; f:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R} ;] is bounded.   Algebra, on the other hand, will look far less familiar to what algebra had previously referred to! A typical first course will look into group theory. A group is a construction in which you have a set of elements and some way of combining them subject to desirable properties. Now you could be interested in solving equations in a group, but there would be no point. Solving equations in groups is completely trivial (no doubt when you study them you shall see why!). The aim for algebra is to understand structure. The course will explore how groups can be decomposed into simpler groups, necessary and/or sufficient conditions for certain types of structure, existence theorems for sub-structures to exist, etc. Again, this is all done with proof. It is likely that this course will also introduce elementary number theory, but a ""real"" number theory course usually occurs later in university.   Overall I have been a bit vague, because otherwise I could be rambling about mathematics you've not experienced, and would make a boringly uninformative read, but hopefully, it gives an idea of what the differences are. Please don't hesitate to ask any questions!"

Even if you're more familiar with the material than most, it doesn't sound like you are all that comfortable with the underlying gears and whistles, so you would probably get a lot out of those courses."

This would be called an ""Advanced Calculus"" (or even ""Introductory Analysis"") course at many universities. The fact that it's called ""Math 1"" says more about Caltech than about the level of the course. Most of your classmates will also have had previous calculus and linear algebra experience, and it's likely a big step up from what any of you have done before.

I've seen a mod-2310 sieve but that adds a lot of complication for little gain.  The ratio phi(p_n#) / p_n# gets smaller, but I can't add any insight to the limit.  It falls fairly rapidly to 0.05x but pretty slow after that.  p_n=210 yields 0.062;  p_n=211 is 0.057; p_n=212 is 0.053; p_n=213 is 0.0495, p_n=214 is 0.0464; p_n=215 is 0.0436.

Empirically (from the values you've given) the series also appears to follow an+1=an*(p(n)-1), though I'm not sure how to prove that remains true.  If it does, then the limiting value will be given by the infinite product from n=1 to infinity of (p(n)-1)/p(n), which I suspect is nonzero (though I haven't actually calculated it)."
math,3byict,madman_bob,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:40:14 2015 UTC,"So from what yomikins said the sequence is phi(p_n#)/p_n# and from what I read on wikipedia phi(n) has an upper bound of y = n - 1, and primorials grow a lot faster than a linear function. Unless I missed something, it seems the limit as n approached infinity would be zero."
math,3byict,frud,4,Fri Jul 3 05:49:47 2015 UTC,"It does tend to zero, but not for the reason you said.  The primorials do indeed grow faster than linear, but you're taking the totient of a primorial, so that's not linear either. So all this tells us is that, if there is a limit, then that limit is at most 1.  But this bound is only achieved by prime numbers, so maybe we can do better.  In fact, as we know the prime factorization of p_n#, we can calculate phi(p_n#) explicitly. This gives  phi(p_n#)/p_n# = prod((p - 1)/p) = prod(1-1/p)  where p ranges over the obvious primes.  This looks like the Riemann zeta function. In fact, this tends to 1/zeta(1) when we take the limit. But the zeta function has a pole at 1, so this limit is 0."

This means that from a Nash Equilibrium perspective, you might as well not even include the ""cooperate"" strategy in the first place. Since there's no potential for gain through cooperation/coordination, the signals won't matter.  It would be different if you were in an iterated prisoner's dilemma, because then ""defect"" is no longer a strictly dominant strategy. You could, for instance, tell the other person that you will cooperate but if they ever defect, you will always defect forever from that point on.   Interesting side note: In PD experiments, allowing communication boosts cooperation rates. The simplest explanation is that the experiments involve money, which is not the same thing as utility. People bear an additional psychological cost from defection (or, conversely, a benefit from cooperation.) If you tell somebody you're going to cooperate, you feel bad if you defect, so you don't even though that would earn you more money."

If you have a graph that you know (somehow) is the graph of a simple polytope, then that polytope is uniquely determined (although it may be the graph of a different polytope in another dimension) (in particular, cubes are simple polytopes).  In general, the two most useful (in my opinion) theorems for dealing with realizability of graphs of polytopes are the following:  Balinski's Theorem says that the graph of a d-polytope is d-connected (it could have higher connectivity).  Branko Grünbaum proved in his book Convex Polytopes a theorem that implies that the graph of a d-polytope must contain a minor that is complete on d+1 vertices.  If you are interested in learning more, I have no problem continuing to answer questions, but do very highly recommend Grünbaum's book.  It contains a ton of results that were at the time new, and has recently been updated by several researchers to bring it up-to-date.  It contains many results that aren't directly about graphs of polytopes (since it isn't a book solely about graphs of polytopes), but grant insight into their more general structure."

It will start assuming you know nothing about polytopes, and will then go on to present the proof of the Upper Bound Theorem, which was then called a conjecture because the proof was discovered as the book was going to the printer. It does suffer from 70's style typesetting, so if that is a problem for you, then you might want to skip this one (though I recommend that you don't).  To get around the difficult-to-readness of it, I typed it in LaTeX as I went along in my first read-through (I won't share the file because of copyright laws and such, but if you are having difficulty reading because of the typesetting, I recommend you do the same).    Grünbaum's Convex Polytopes is absolutely fabulous and can take you from knowing nothing about polytopes to ready to do research.  It has recently been updated to contain answers to questions that were previously unsolved, and new results.  Ziegler's Lectures on Polytopes is not as thorough, but does contain several things that are not in Grünbaum's book.

math,3bwann,mhd-hbd,2,Fri Jul 3 14:40:23 2015 UTC,"I had actually been interested in them since middle school, but the truth is that I went to a school because I thought I wanted to work with a particular professor.  After taking a graduate class or two from him, I realized that I didn't really want to work in that field (the undergraduate topics were more interesting to me that the graduate topics).  So I started shopping around in the department for a different advisor, and eventually ended up where I did."

math,3bwann,edcba54321,6,Fri Jul 3 17:02:49 2015 UTC,"Graph theory certainly plays a role in the study of N-polytopes, but it is not quite enough for some things. Graphs are a very general structure, and so ""forgets"" a lot of information about polytopes."
math,3bwann,whirligig231,2,Thu Jul 2 21:37:47 2015 UTC,Here's a related question: do any two non-isomorphic polytopes (isomorphic here defined in terms of a homeomorphism that preserves flags) have the same skeleton graph?
math,3bwann,edcba54321,4,Thu Jul 2 21:51:31 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Cyclic polytopes in dimensions greater than 3 all have complete graphs.  So, C(15,4) and C(15,5) both have the same graph.    There are also examples where both polytopes have the same dimension, though they are a bit harder to construct."
math,3bwann,aszkid,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:55:40 2015 UTC,Are there any examples in dimension < 4?
math,3bwann,edcba54321,2,Fri Jul 3 00:36:20 2015 UTC,"No.    In dimension 0 the only graph of a polytope is a vertex with no edges.  In dimension 1, the only graph is two vertices with an edge connecting them.  (So no examples in dimension 0 or 1.)  In dimension 2, all polytopes have cycle graphs. (So no examples in dimension 0, 1, or 2)  For 3-dimensional polytopes, we need a little more machinery:  Steinitz's theorem says that the graphs of 3-polytopes are exactly the 3-connected, planar graphs.    So, it turns out that if you have a graph that you know is the graph of a 3-polytope, then you actually know what the polytope is.  First, find a planar embedding of the graph (this is possible by Steinitz's theorem).  Now every region corresponds to a 2-face of your polytope.  At this point, you know how all of the facets intersect, and therefore know the entire face-lattice.  Since none of the 0, 1, or 2 dimensional polytopes have 3-connected graphs, there are no examples of distinct polytopes of dimension less than 3 with the same graphs.  P.S. if you are so inclined, you can consider the empty polytope, but doing so leads to the issue of whether it has a graph or not.  Most people (that I have met) don't like the idea of a graph with an empty vertex set; if you allow it, then most of your theorems have to include the caveat that you are excluding the empty graph."
math,3bwann,whirligig231,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:01:58 2015 UTC,"You can encode all the combinatorial information of a polytope in a face lattice (the Hasse diagram), and thus establish combinatorial equivalence between two polytopes if their associated graphs are isomorphic.  Graphs are used to construct a subset of what's called 'generalized permutohedra': graph-associahedra. You can build the permutohedra from an n-path, the associahedra from the complete graph on n vertices, the cyclohedra from the n-cycle, etc...  Graphs are used quite a bit, but they are not absolutely fundamental."
math,3bwann,edcba54321,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:37:58 2015 UTC,"...and thus establish combinatorial equivalence between two polytopes if their associated graphs are isomorphic.   I'm not sure we mean the same things when we say ""combinatorial equivalence"".  What that means is that there is an order preserving bijection between the corresponding face lattices.    If two polytopes have isomorphic graphs, then they are not necessarily combinatorially equivalent.  See my reply to /u/whirligig231 for an example."

math,3bupql,CyclingTechHelpPlz,65,Thu Jul 2 08:36:16 2015 UTC,"I am two years out of a post doctoral position and have, so far managed to continue to publish. I've also presented at a conference and as part of a specialised seminar series. I've continued two active collaborations and have published as a consequence of them.  I left academia partly because of the issues you raised and also because of what the consequences of chasing an academic career would be. I miss the academic life greatly, but I have substantial more freedom to research what I want to.  By the time I left I had already established a reputation and was well known in my field. This has helped a great deal. I had existing collaborations and I had plenty of people willing to give introductions for me to other universities. If I didn't have this I would definitely have struggled. As it is the local maths department is still a bit wary of me. I suspect that they don't know what to do with me, I want to be involved, but I don't have the time to be ""seen around the department"". This makes it hard to build the trust and rapport necessary to have an effective relationship.  If I'm not working then I'm doing research. There's not much in between for me. I don't think it's necessary to spend that much time doing research in order to be productive but... it certainly helps me. I'd estimate for every 1 hour of research I do upwards of 4 hours of work. And the hour of research isn't ""quality time"".  I have become more focused on larger problems in my field. The pressure to publish was so strong on younger academics that I found myself and my peers deliberately selecting research that I could accurately predict the outcome of. Now that I'm free of that I can work on problems that I'd otherwise have to ignore. This also has the benefit of reducing competition to my research and increasing the interest that others might have in my research.   With regards to research without a PhD, I'm not really sure. It is very difficult to get genuine research level insight about any area of mathematics. This is, I think, the principle reason why mathematics is so very splintered. Mathematicians almost have to become specialised. It is Very difficult, but not impossible and the difficulty will decrease over time as the quality of resources online increases. My only real suggestion is to not spread yourself too thinly and to study what you enjoy. Every field has outstanding problems waiting for someone with the determination of a honey badger to solve.   And that's one advantage I have over my academic colleagues. I don't have to publish, I can pick hard problems and nut away at them for years with no consequence. And you know? Who cares if I didn't publish or didn't solve it? I can plot my progress online, share my knowledge and my enjoyment of the chase.  TL;DR: Yes, a lot, no, no, most definitely, heaps, depends on the area of research I guess."

If you have good links with people to work with and who can get you access to journals, etc then you can probably do it. If you publish with them jointly, then it would makes things a lot easier, IMO.  Another thing is attending conferences and presenting your work - you can pay for it yourself but it'd get very expensive. If you know enough people then you could at least get invited to seminars (in fact I'm pretty sure I could go along to seminars at any of my old universities without it being an issue).  In terms of research if you've only got a BSc or MSc.. well it depends on the individual, but those sorts of programmes don't really teach you how to do research.. so it would make it more difficult IMO.  I'm currently coming to the end of my first postdoc and am looking more and more like I'm going to leave academia, so have been thinking something similar. I'd be looking at publishing/finishing off things which are outstanding from my PhD thesis and others from my current research, but I think doing new research on topics which I don't know well would be far more difficult.  The last thing is.. why? Do you want to go back into research later? Are you just wanting to do it for ""fun""?

Maybe not all universities are like that, but if you are a genuine researcher in a university town, eventually you might find it easy to be given teaching assignments, office space, and anything else that a paid up member of academia gets. I know of 3 or 4 well-known and well-respected researchers who do not bother with the formalities (think also of the rare cases like Erdos), but I'm talking not about really exceptional researchers, but researchers who match the abilities of members of a university department. They are obviously quite welcome in seminars etc."

Again, not everyone gets a PhD but since there is often funding for PhD students, getting a PhD is  a way of getting money.  .  One of the criteria of a successful thesis is that a result from it gets through all the formalities of a refereed paper being accepted. At the lowest level, that is a pretty low bar, because it involves understanding another paper, and essentially solving exercises that implicitly were stated there, but not worked out. Getting a paper through the refereeing process is a slightly higher bar than just getting a PhD approved, and if you do not have a PhD you could try doing that instead I guess, but I can't think why not do it following the formalities of the PhD process..."

I lived near a major university in the year I took off between college and grad school, and when I contacted seminar organizers to ask if they were open to the public, they were at times enthusiastic that an outsider was interested in coming. You should be able to find the times and locations of seminars on departmental websites, so as long as chairs are not at a premium (this does happen often in my current department) you should have no trouble just showing up. Mathematicians are, as a rule, so awkward that they won't bother you."

math,3bupql,fridofrido,2,Thu Jul 2 16:36:37 2015 UTC,"Formally, there is no reason why you could not pursue research doing your spare time. Sure, having a university email account helps with reading papers (library subscriptions, mathscinet and all that). It also helps with posting to the arxiv. But if you're not a crackpot and are actually proving theorems it's not a big deal. Same goes with collaborators (which are much more of a personal interaction type of thing, rather than a credentials one). Also, I don't see why anyone would bar you from attending a seminar (and conferences in pure math tend to be free and open anyway).  On the other hand, if you want to ask whether it's a reasonable thing to do, then the answer is likely no. The reason is that producing research is very time consuming and requires lots of motivation and optimism.   On the other hand again, I have to agree with wuzzlewozzit. I am currently in the situation where I am trying to pursue results I know I can prove and quickly publish, rather than trying to tackle open ended problems which would probably lead nowhere (and lead to me not finding a job). Having this pressure off (which of course can be achieved just the same by getting tenure!) would be great and would give me more freedom. I just don't personally think that having a job would give me more freedom, but quite the opposite (in that I would simply stop pursuing research altogether)."

Departments, and whole universities are assessed on a kind of career length vs publication strength. The final score is hugely important as it relates to funding for, in one case, the next six years.   Departments that have, or are thought to have, under performing candidates can  force them into teaching only positions, so as to avoid having the persons record effect the departments score. Actually getting fired for under performing is difficult, but that won't stop the administrators from making life difficult and potentially unenjoyable.

By definition, the first uncountable ordinal is the first one that has uncountably many elements before it. So each of the uncountably many ordinals before it are all countable. This is essentially the same statement as ""There are infinitely many finite ordinals (numbers).""  There is no limit to how large we can make ordinals. With any class of ordinals, you can ""take the supremum"" to get a larger one.  Why do you think that cardinals are smaller than ordinals? For any ordinal number beta, there is a corresponding cardinal aleph_beta (think aleph_0, aleph_1, aleph_2, ..., aleph_omega, etc). (This requires the axiom of choice to establish the well-orderedness of the cardinals, I think. I'm no set theory expert though.) At least for small ordinals, the corresponding cardinal is much larger."

You can't necessarily take the supremum of a class of ordinals.  Incidentally, it is independent from ZFC whether the cardinal corresponding to a given ordinal is always larger than the ordinal (not true).  A cardinal whose corresponding ordinal is the same as the cardinal would be weakly inaccessible, making it larger than any cardinal that can be proved to exist using ZFC.  Edit: Apparently weakly inaccessible cardinals have the property I mentioned, but there are smaller cardinals whose existence you can prove that are fixed points of the aleph function.  For example, the cardinal NN_N..., which is defined as the ascending union of the sequence N_0, N_N_0, N_N_N_0, . . ., is a fixed point of the aleph function, but is not weakly inaccessible."
math,3bx9ux,jimbelk,5,Fri Jul 3 00:12:03 2015 UTC,"To clarify: by ""cardinal corresponding to an ordinal"" you mean ""aleph number with an ordinal subscript."" One could misinterpret your ""corresponding to"" as ""equinumerous to,"" in which case it's clearly not larger."

math,3bx9ux,whirligig231,2,Fri Jul 3 00:53:11 2015 UTC,"These remarks will assume that ZFC is true, and hence consistent.  I'm not an expert in this, but my understanding is that the existence of a weakly inaccessible cardinal K implies the consistency of ZFC, since the constructible universe consisting of all sets that hereditarily have cardinality less than K will be a model for ZFC.  Since the consistency of ZFC cannot be proven in ZFC, it follows that the existence of a weakly inaccessible cardinal cannot be proven in ZFC.  This isn't the same as being ""independent"".  A statement is ""independent"" of ZFC if neither it nor its negation can be proven in ZFC.  (For example, the Continuum Hypothesis is independent of ZFC, since it cannot be proven in ZFC, but it is consistent with ZFC.)  So if we want to prove that the existence of a weakly inaccessible cardinal is independent of ZFC, we must also prove that the existence of such a cardinal is consistent with ZFC.  Now, the situation with this direction is that it is widely believed to be true that the existence of a weakly inaccessible cardinal is consistent with ZFC.  However, it is not possible to prove in ZFC that the existence of a weakly inaccessible cardinal is consistent with ZFC, since the existence of a weakly inaccessible cardinal proves the consistency of ZFC (see this argument).  Basically, what this means is that the existence of a weakly inaccessible cardinal is stuck in a logical no-man's land similar to, but not quite the same as, being independent.  For all we know, we will find a proof tomorrow in ZFC that weakly inaccessible cardinals do not exist, and there is no way in ZFC to rule this possibility out. However, this seems very unlikely -- roughly on par with the chance that ZFC will be proven inconsistent tomorrow -- and it seems much more likely the the existence of such cardinals is indeed independent of ZFC."

After all, cardinals are simply ordinals such that there is no bijection between it and any smaller ordinal. The axiom of choice is to establish that every set has a well-ordering, and therefore a corresponding cardinal number."
math,3bx9ux,Borgcube,5,Thu Jul 2 23:59:12 2015 UTC,"Some places will define a cardinal to be an equivalence class of equinumerous sets (or a representative set in that class). In this context, choice is equivalent to the statement that every cardinal contains / is equinumerous to an ordinal. Aleph_k is defined including the stipulation that every aleph number is a well-ordered cardinal, so we need choice to say that all infinite sets have an aleph number."
math,3bx9ux,whirligig231,3,Fri Jul 3 00:43:31 2015 UTC,"Right, but you can still define cardinality of ordinals without choice, which is enough for the current discussion."

The point is, however, you cannot treat this as a completely ordinary free variable because it is not a completely ordinary free variable: it stands for the witness that the existential quantifier is true. Therefore, the thing that you prove (B) must not mention this variable, because after you discharge the hypothesis A(y) that witnessing variable would be treated just like any other free variable, which is wrong.

Let's say we want to prove that: ∃x P(x) (i.e. a ""P"" exists) implies ¬∀x ¬P(x) (i.e. it's not true that everything is not a ""P"")  I would prove it like this:  1. ∃x P(x)         2. [a] P(a)          3. ∀x ¬P(x)           4. ¬P(a)              ∀ Elim   : 3         5. ⊥                  ⊥ Intro  : 2, 4     6. ¬∀x ¬P(x)              ¬ Intro  : 3-5 7. ¬∀x ¬P(x)                  ∃ Elim   : 1,2-6     (1) is the premise (2) is the beginning of a subproof where we introduce some hypothetical object a and we assume that a is a P (3) is the beginning of a subproof within the subproof, where we assume that everything is not a P In (4) we show (by universal elimination) that if everything is not a P then our hypothetical object a is not a P In (5) we show (by contradiction introduction) that (2) and (4) leads to a contradiction So in (6) we use our whole sub-subproof (from 3 to 5) to show that withint our subproof it's not true that every object is not a P Finally, in (7) we use existential elimination on our very first premise and our whole subproof to show that it's indeed true that the existence of an object that is a P implies that not all objects are not P.  Now, notice that: the x in step 6 is bound, and that's why we can use ¬∀x ¬P(x) as a valid result of existential elimination. This means that the ""x"" is step 6 is, for all practical purposes, not the same x in step 1. It's a different variable. In fact, you could just as well rewrite the whole thing as:  1. ∃x P(x)         2. [a] P(a)          3. ∀y ¬P(y)           4. ¬P(a)              ∀ Elim   : 3         5. ⊥                  ⊥ Intro  : 2, 4     6. ¬∀y ¬P(y)              ¬ Intro  : 3-5 7. ¬∀y ¬P(y)                  ∃ Elim   : 1,2-6   Which is the proof that ∃x P(x) => ¬∀y ¬P(y) which means the same as ∃x P(x) => ¬∀x ¬P(x)"

But then I don't understand the rule at all. Can't we just write the following?  1. ∃x P(x)     2. [a] P(a)      3. ∀y ¬P(y)       4. ¬P(a)              ∀ Elim   : 3     5. ⊥                  ⊥ Intro  : 2, 4 6. ¬∀y ¬P(y)              ¬ Intro  : 3-5   That is, I don't understand why we can't just say that if ∃x P(x) then P(a) for some a.  edit: Maybe because then we might also introduce [b] P(b) and [c] P(c) which would imply that there are at least 3 objects for which P holds?"

Also, to back up the difficulty argument: I held a 100% average in Geometry all year (I am in advanced math classes, and this is not meant for me to gloat), which if you adjusted for the extra credit points I received would likely be about 96% or so.

Extreme example: answer 1 out of 6 Mathematical Olympiad questions half correctly, and you're one of the best students in the world.  But for mandatory standardized exams with long histories taken by thousands of secondary students, administrators need to be more deliberate.  First, there's the psychological burden of making vast numbers of students feel like they failed in mathematics, a subject that already has its stigma; then passing them anyway.  Secondly, if a 15-year-old passes knowing little more than one-third of the material on an exam that purports to assess what they've been studying all year, can we say they've been successfully educated under the existing curriculum, and are therefore considered ""college and/or career ready"" and should graduate?  While administrators are still trying to get their act together, they seem not to notice that students are moving on with their lives, ""educated"" or not.

Consider an exam that hasn't been taken, so no points have been awarded yet. This point-less (not pointless, heh) exam won't just be an indication of the student's abilities, but also a reflection of the instructor's ability to convey the necessary knowledge and also gauge appropriate questions for an exam - choosing questions can be incredibly difficult. Now, let's say a class takes the exam and the average is 55%, thus a curve is likely applied (usually bringing the mean up to 70 or 75%) so a passing grade might actually be around 35%.  Note that the statistical spread of student scores doesn't change (aside from capping out at 100): all that happens is a shift of score to meet university requirements. Thus test scores are often effectively meaningless as they are only indications of your relative ability against other students', the teachers ability to actually teach, and the university pass/fail requirements."

Each postdoc lasts between a few months and 3 years, and many postdoctoral positions only hire people within about 5 years of their PhD. After that you have to get a professor job to continue in academics. Postdocs are not that easy to get but are much easier than faculty positions, which are super hard to get. Also, remember that you can't be picky: you have to apply everywhere (in the world, literally) and go to whoever wants to hire you, if anyone does.  Teaching-oriented positions may be easier to get, but you won't have the time for too much research. Also, to get these you have to focus on getting teaching experience during grad school."

Also, how hard is it to slowly transfer from a teaching-oriented position to a research-oriented position?   Probably very hard. The older you are, the more publications are expected on your CV.

We have someone just leaving this summer who is going to UW-Stout (U of Wisconsin).  There are many fine teaching-oriented colleges and universities in the US.  There are good careers there for people who love teaching.    If you love mathematics and want to have time for your own research that you want to do, there are options like I've described.  But you have to do your homework.  By second year in graduate school you should be looking at web pages of places you might want to apply to later.  What do those faculty do?

If you are independently wealthy, or if you have some special inside track (you are exceptionally gifted, get along well with your phd advisor, and he has a Fields medal) then it's okay.

Nevertheless, if you are open to going to non-research universities, then you can be very happy and live a good life without needing stellar post-docs or anything like that. You will focus on teaching as your job and research as a side occupation (but way more so than a hobby, which is the best someone who left pure mathematics can hope for), which may be a great path. If you don't get a good postdoc, there are many small schools who will add you to their faculty and even more community colleges that you could work for and have a similar experience of part-time research. You can still go to conferences (on your own dime) and in today's era of arXiv, you can read pretty much any paper, with e-mail you can contact professors anywhere, and they will most likely respond if you have legitimate mathematical questions especially if they pertain to their research, and you can buy any book.  Mathematics isn't shut off if you don't become a research professor at a Tier 1 university, in fact you can have a very fulfilling career and not become a professional adjunct, or buckle under the pressure.

So this is an infinity larger than the natural-number infinities; call it aleph_ω. But we can then find a bigger infinity aleph(ω+1), and so on. In general, given any set of cardinals, this allows us to find a bigger cardinal than any of the ones in a set, so the cardinals are too numerous to form a set.

math,3bsjn9,AnticPosition,10,Thu Jul 2 07:54:20 2015 UTC,"You can't teach proofs if you aren't testing for proofs, at least at the pre-college level, because most of the students will just tune out if they know they don't need something.  Hell, they might tune out even if they think they need something for a test but not more broadly.    But really, by the time students are at middle school, they will have the impression that math is a collection of algorithms that they need to memorize and apply, and will tune out anything you lecture about that doesn't fall into that category.  So the first practical suggestion?  Any change you make has to be made at the beginning.  The second practical suggestion?  The most important changes will involve the students actively doing math, because learning problem solving involves thinking, not memorizing.  Unfortunately, if you want to teach mathematics as problem solving instead of mathematics as memorization and application of algorithms, you need teachers who understand mathematics as problem solving, and my understanding is that, at least in the US, most math teachers do not.  But no single curriculum change is going to make a huge difference in results, and before we overhaul the math curriculum, we need to think very carefully about what exactly we reasonably hope to accomplish."

math,3bsjn9,completely-ineffable,10,Thu Jul 2 00:53:07 2015 UTC,"I think it would be wrong to read Thurston as arguing something very similar to what von Neumann argues. It's true that Thurston talks about how mathematics isn't purely formal, how the point of proofs in papers and talks is to convince other mathematicians, not to give a fully rigorous deduction. It's true he says that the level of formal correctness and precision in mathematics is much less than that in a computer program. It's true that he talks about the social nature of mathematical research.  But not being overly formal isn't the same thing as doing empirical science. Thurston isn't arguing that the methods used in mathematics are the same methods used in the natural sciences. In contrast, consider how von Neumann ends his essay:   I think that it is a relatively good approximation to truth - which is much too complicated to allow anything but approximations-that mathematical ideas originate in empirics, although the genealogy is sometimes long and obscure. But, once they are so conceived, the subject begins to live a peculiar life of its own and is better compared to a creative one, governed by almost entirely aesthetical motivations, than to anything else and, in particular, to an empirical science. There is, however, a further point which, I believe, needs stressing. As a mathematical discipline travels far from its empirical source, or still more, if it is a second and third generation only indirectly inspired by ideas coming from ""reality"" it is beset with very grave dangers. It becomes more and more purely aestheticizing, more and more purely I'art pour I'art. This need not be bad, if the field is surrounded by correlated subjects, which still have closer empirical connections, or if the discipline is under the influence of men with an exceptionally well-developed taste. But there is a grave danger that the subject will develop along the line of least resistance, that the stream, so far from its source, will separate into a multitude of insignificant branches, and that the discipline will become a disorganized mass of details and complexities. In other words, at a great distance from its empirical source, or after much ""abstract"" inbreeding, a mathematical subject is in danger of degeneration. At the inception the style is usually classical; when it shows signs of becoming baroque, then the danger signal is up. It would be easy to give examples, to trace specific evolutions into the baroque and the very high baroque, but this, again, would be too technical.  In any event, whenever this stage is reached, the only remedy seems to me to be the rejuvenating return to the source: the re-injection of more or less directly empirical ideas. I am convinced that this was a necessary condition to conserve the freshness and the vitality of the subject and that this will remain equally true in the future.    Thurston isn't saying this sort of thing. He's not worried that abstract mathematics will degenerate if it doesn't cleave closely to the natural sciences. He's not suggesting that we ought inject empirical ideas into abstract mathematics."

I will not try to resolve this by discussing what mathematics is, because it would take us far afield.

For me, “the theory of formal patterns” has come the closest, but to discuss this would be a whole essay in itself.   Could the difficulty in giving a good direct definition of mathematics be an essential one, indicating that mathematics has an essential recursive quality? Along these lines we might say that mathematics is the smallest subject satisfying the following:   Mathematics includes the natural numbers and plane and solid geometry. Mathematics is that which mathematicians study. Mathematicians are those humans who advance human understanding of mathematics.   In other words, as mathematics advances, we incorporate it into our thinking.

In fact, he proved something that seems to go in the other direction, namely that any statement that is true in all models for which some set of axioms hold (in first order predicate logic) can be logically derived from those axioms in his completeness theorem for first order predicate logic."

math,3bsjn9,completely-ineffable,10,Thu Jul 2 13:18:37 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with that interpretation personally   Speaking just about the version of the incompleteness theorems for arithmetic, you should agree with that interpretation. Elementary model theoretic considerations show that Peano arithmetic is Sigma_1-complete, meaning that any statement true in N which can be expressed with a single unbounded existential quantifier is a theorem of PA. It's not terribly difficult to see that the independent statement produced in the proof of the incompleteness theorem is Pi_1, i.e. equivalent to the negation of a Sigma_1 formula. Thus, if it were false, it would be provable. It's not provable, so it must be true.  The incompleteness theorems are so widely misunderstood that it's certainly prudent to be skeptical of interpretations of them. However, this is a case where the interpretation is correct.   I think Gödel himself was a platonist and considered the theorem evidence for platonism.   Gödel was a platonist of some stripe, but it's not quite true that he considered the incompleteness theorems evidence for platonism. The SEP page for the incompleteness theorems explains his thoughts on this pretty nicely."
math,3bsjn9,Exomnium,2,Thu Jul 2 11:41:40 2015 UTC,"I was originally planning on a writing a longer response to /u/WhackAMoleE's original post and then I saw /u/hei_mailma's and wrote a shorter one. I realize that the version of the statement I made in the post I actually made wasn't careful enough. I should say before I get into this that I'm sort of rusty on mathematical logic and that my opinion might come down to me being more of a formalist/finitist than most people with mathematical training.   What I should have said was ""Gödel's incompleteness theorem should not be interpreted as saying 'We can prove things extralogically by using Gödel's-incompleteness-theorem-style reasoning.'""  If you consider, for example, the Gödel sentence of ZFC as a statement in the language of PA you get a statement which is independent of PA if ZFC is consistent and false in PA if ZFC is inconsistent, but this reading of Gödel's incompleteness theorem naively implies that the statement is true and therefore true in the standard model of PA. (Of course PA itself could be inconsistent too but I wanted to focus on statements about the standard model of PA, which doesn't make sense if PA is inconsistent.)  The proof you gave is valid but it has to be embedded in some set theory expressed in first order logic to be absolutely rigorous (because second order logic doesn't have a completeness theorem). Ultimately I'm wary of making too platonist sounding claims based on Gödel's incompleteness theorem and acting like you can formally capture the intuitive notion of finite natural numbers because there's no way of escaping the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem: you can call the unique model of second order PA the natural numbers but you can only formalize that model relative to a model of some set theory which might itself be non-standard and imply the existence of infinite natural numbers. And trying to avoid that by working in a second order set theory just leads to an infinite regress.  Now that said I don't know how pathological a set theory can be. Specifically I don't know if it's possible to have a set theory in which the Gödel sentence of PA is false in the unique model of second order PA."

I agree that that's a poor interpretation of the incompleteness theorems. The argument I sketched could be called metamathematical, but it's not extralogical. As you note, to found the argument one needs some sort of set theory (or something equivalent).  However, using words in the ordinary sense we use them in mathematics, I think what I said is correct. Much like we would say that Goodstein's theorem is true, we would say that the Gödel sentence for PA is true (even though neither of these is provable from PA). None of this depends upon taking a specific view about the philosophy of mathematics or what mathematical truth is. I'm not presupposing a platonist account of mathematical truth or anything of the like. (Hell, what I said would be perfectly acceptable to a fictionalist, who believes that there is no such thing as mathematical truth.)   The proof you gave is valid but it has to be embedded in some set theory expressed in first order logic to be absolutely rigorous (because second order logic doesn't have a completeness theorem).   Nitpick: the argument I sketched isn't dependent upon what logic the ambient set theory is expressed in. The point is that in this set theory we can formulate first-order logic and prove the facts about it used in the argument I gave. For example, second-order ZFC could derive the result I mentioned.   Ultimately I'm wary of making too platonist sounding claims based on Gödel's incompleteness theore   The claim was one about truth. Platonism doesn't own the concept of mathematical truth and it would be really weird to try to argue for platonism based upon the argument I sketched.   and acting like you can formally capture the intuitive notion of finite natural numbers    Nothing I said relied upon being able to formally capture the intuitive notion of natural numbers. That is no more a requirement for what I said than it is a requirement to prove the infinitude of primes.   Now that said I don't know how pathological a set theory can be. Specifically I don't know if it's possible to have a set theory in which the Gödel sentence of PA is false in the unique model of second order PA.   It's not possible. Any set theory worth a damn will be able to carry out the argument I sketched. This is true even for a set theory like ZFC + ¬Con(ZFC), which has no well-founded models."

I think I'm implicitly responding to /u/WhackAMoleE's original statement because in my mind the idea of talking about mathematical truth about infinite objects without logic requires platonism because in order to construct a model you always need to talk about it in some other formal system and without platonism the process needs to end on an uninterpreted formal system.   Nothing I said relied upon being able to formally capture the intuitive notion of natural numbers. That is no more a requirement for what I said than it is a requirement to prove the infinitude of primes.   I didn't integrate it very well but I brought that up because the intuitive justification for the statement ""Every Sigma_1 statement that is not proven true by PA is false in the standard model of PA."" is essentially the intuitive notion of finite natural numbers (not that that's how you justified it), but I'm being extremely conservative and allowing for the possibility that there just are no omega-consistent theories in the language of PA.

Sure, second-order logic doesn't have a nice model theory. What I was trying to say is that inside, say, set theory axiomatized with second-order logic we can carry out first-order model theory. First-order model theory is well-behaved and we can prove this in second-order set theory.   I think I'm implicitly responding to /u/WhackAMoleE's original statement because in my mind the idea of talking about mathematical truth about infinite objects without logic requires platonism   That's a pretty controversial position to take. It's also at odds with how we ordinarily talk about things. For example, most mathematicians don't balk at the idea of saying that the intermediate value theorem is true. Yet it is a statement about infinite objects.   (There's nothing wrong, necessarily, with thinking that our ordinary way of speaking doesn't actually line up with what mathematical truth is. If one thinks this way, then one would think that when we talk about 'truth' here, really something else is meant. Consider as an analogous case how the fictionalist wouldn't think that using the existential quantifier obligates one to believe mathematical objects really exist. But it's artificial to single out statements close to mathematical logic from other mathematical statements in this scenario. If one believes that we can't talk about 'truth' about models of arithmetic, one should also believe we can't talk about 'truth' about Banach spaces or whatever.)   the intuitive justification for the statement ""Every Sigma_1 statement that is not proven true by PA is false in the standard model of PA."" is essentially the intuitive notion of finite natural numbers   How I see the intuition for the idea is that the standard model embeds as an initial segment into any model of PA. Regardless, I don't see why the intuitive justification for a mathematical statement should play such an essential role in things. Even if it were faulty to think there is a coherent concept of natural number, many mathematical results are based upon intuitions that turn out to be faulty on some level.   but I'm being extremely conservative and allowing for the possibility that there just are no omega-consistent theories in the language of PA. (Although now that I think about it I'm not sure whether or not that's a coherent idea.)   Uh, there are very obviously omega-consistent theories in the language of arithmetic. For example, axiomatize the notion of successor in the obvious way. The resulting theory is omega-consistent. Less trivially, we have proofs that PA itself is omega-consistent.    What is a well-founded model?   A model of set theory is well-founded if its membership relation is a well-founded relation, i.e. it has no infinite descending chains.   Is there a formal statement of the impossibility?    Yes.   Or is it in principle possible that there are no consistent set theories that are 'worth a damn'?

Right, but those proofs are in ZFC or some other set theory, right? So (and I know this is exceedingly far fetched) isn't it possible that a) all of the set theories we've proven PA omega-consistent in are themselves inconsistent and b) the only consistent set theories we find all prove PA is omega-inconsistent?   A model of set theory is well-founded if its membership relation is well-founded.    By ""worth a damn"" I meant capable of carrying out basic model theory.

What is the precise definition of being able to carry out basic model theory and is there a proof that any set theory satisfying those requirements proves that the unique model of second-order arithmetic satisfies PA's Gödel sentence (I think this would be the formal statement of the impossibility I was looking for)?

By the first incompleteness theorem, PA + ¬γ is consistent, where γ is the Gödel sentence for PA. By the completeness theory, every consistent theory has a model. Thus, there is a (necessarily non-standard) model of PA + ¬γ.  But I don't think /u/WhackAMoleE's comment is imprecise. It's a fact that there is no consistent, computably enumerable set of axioms whose logical consequences include all true sentences about N. That there are other structures with different truths doesn't seem relevant.  As for the question in the linked thread, it's not just that the Goldbach conjecture is universally quantified. It's that it's universally quantified and has only the one unbounded quantifier. Speaking in the jargon, it's a Pi_1 statement. Or really, since we also want to talk about general set theoretic statements, it's a Pi^0_1 statement, the superscript 0 meaning that it only quantifies over natural numbers. GCH on the other hand, mentioned in the linked thread, is universally quantified, but is not Pi^0_1. It's something like Pi_2, meaning that it can be expressed in the form ∀x ∃y φ(x,y), where φ only contains bounded quantifiers, i.e. quantifiers of the form ∀z∈a or ∃z∈a. The argument for why the Goldbach conjecture must be true if, say, PA fails to prove it does not hold for GCH.  But maybe I'm not understanding what the issue at hand is in the linked thread."

The 91% were all contributed in donations of $0.01 The remaining 9% came from one single person   This gives you a total of 4.095.000.001 contributors.

Not enough information to solve it.  If you assumed a distribution for the donor sizes (eg an exponential distribution or a power law) then it could be solved.  Actually for fun I'll see what number you get if you assume that the donations are exponential (probably not a good assumption).  First we need to decide what value the parameter lambda should have in order to predict that 91% of donations are below 100. IE we need to solve integral (x = 0 to 100) of lambda*e-x*lambda = 0.91.  This is easiest when done numerically and gives lambda ~ 0.024, The mean is then 1/0.024 = 41.67.  45 million/41.67 = 1,080,000 donors.  An exponential distribution is probably a terrible assumption for this sort of application, as I'm assuming that she will have a small amount of very large donors. A power law might work better. Here we have to solve a similar equation to calculate the power exponent a ~ 1.52.  Unfortunately, power laws with exponent less than 2 have infinite mean! So this is not a very good distribution to choose.  Perhaps we can fix this problem by assuming that she had a minimum donation amount of $20. This brings the exponent up to a~2.5, which allows us the compute a mean of $60, which gives an estimate of   45 million/60 = 750,000 donors.  However we should go back and apply $20 minimum assumption to the exponential model as well, to see what happens. Now we get lambda~0.03 and a mean of 53.33 resulting in an estimate of  45 million/60 = 844,000 donors."
math,3bwc8l,AnythingApplied,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:19:01 2015 UTC,"Lets calculate the maximum and minimum answers.  Suppose x is the number of donors, .01<=y<=100 is the average contribution for under 100, and 100<z<=2700 is the average for over 100.  We get  x*.91*y+x*.09*z=45,000,000  x=45,000,000/(.91y+.09z)  If we want x to be as large as possible we'd use y=.01, z=100.01  x=45,000,000/(.91*.01+.09*100.01)=4,994,450 contributors maximum.  At a minimum we use x=100, y=2700 we get  x=45,000,000/(.91*100+.09*2700)=134,730 contributors minimum  So 134k to 5 million is a pretty big range of possible answers.  My apologies for bringing in outside info (the 2700 feels like cheating).  Using 45,000,000/(.91y+.09z) you can play around with various other ""reasonable"" assumptions, but the problem is the y doesn't matter that much and 100-2700 is a huge range.  A lot of people, especially those involved with PACs tend to contribute the max amount which really breaks distribution assumptions."

math,3bx89b,JJMaginnis,11,Thu Jul 2 22:14:07 2015 UTC,The sum of the natural numbers is certainly not -1/12.  The sum of the natural numbers does not converge to any number.  So no -1/12 is not  triangle number.  However if the sum of the natural numbers did converge to -1/12 I suppose it would be one.  Edit: wording
math,3bx89b,Wigglepus,8,Thu Jul 2 22:56:55 2015 UTC,"The sum of all natural numbers is not equal to -1/12. It does not have a value.   For example, we can take the equation √(2x-1)=-x (where x is in the reals). Squaring both sides, we get 2x-1=x2 , so it seems that our answer is x=1, right? Well, it isn't. If we plug it back in it's not a valid solution. What we're basically showing with the squaring both sides trick is that if there was a solution, it would have to be x=1.  Similarly, the sum of all natural numbers diverges - it is infinite. However, we can use something called ""zeta function regularization"" to find what it would be if it existed. This technique gives us -1/12. And sometimes we can actually use this result - for example, sometimes in physics, when we have an infinite number of possible virtual particles, we find that we have to add up all the natural numbers, and we can use -1/12 instead and the math works out. But zeta regularization only works in a couple specific scenarios like this one; it is not correct at all to say it's equal to that sum.  (Also, that Numberphile video's ""proof"" is wrong in several ways. Nearly everything they do is disallowed because it would make math inconsistent, even if you assume they're talking about zeta regularization rather than actual sums.)  Anyway, we can rewrite your question slightly more formally as ""given the function T(x) with x in the ordinals from 0 toω, where T(ω)=-1/12, would -1/12 be the smallest or the largest value of the function?"" The answer is clearly that -1/12 is the smallest output. The fact that it happens to have the largest input in a mostly strictly increasing function is not relevant."

Given an infinite series, there are many potential meanings for the sum of the series. Here is a partial list in roughly increasing order of strength:   The limit of the net of partial sums in the discrete topology The limit of the net of partial sums in the standard topology The limit of the sequence of partial sums (in the standard topology) The limit of the sequence of partial sums with linearly decreasing weights The limit of the generating function of the sequence at 1 The constant term of the Euler-Maclaurin formula for the partial sums   These are better known as finite summation, absolute convergence, convergence, Cesaro summation, Abel summation, and Ramanujan summation, respectively.  Most people, when they write a + b + c + d + ... = S, exclusively mean (3). But when you see the equation 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ... = 1/2, meaning (3) would be absurd, so the writer is probably assuming (4) or (5). When you see the equation 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ... = 1/4, the writer is probably assuming (5). And when you see the equation 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... = -1/12, the writer is probably assuming (6).  There is often a debate, in mathematics and its applications, over the degree to which a particular notation should be ""abused"" to mean multiple things. In the case of infinite series, many experts feel that (3) is the only acceptable meaning for the notation, and all other meanings are too confusing to be shown to young people.  There is also the issue that (4), (5), and (6) are not part of the core mathematics curriculum for undergraduates, so a majority of mathematically literate Internet users are not aware of the rigorous theory that underlies them, and view them with irrational suspicion.

Their model is only inspired by Littlewood-Paley theory as they never actually switch to frequency space but use the dyadics to model it. Note also that this is only a simple model that tries to capture some of the properties of the nonlinear term, but it does not give direct results about the actual equations (the main discrepancy is that in this model you get that energy always flows down the dyadic tree, but that doesn't actually happen in the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations) . A much more sophisticated model is given in ""Finite time blowup for an averaged three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation"" by Terry Tao.

I like books that actually make the book interesting while you are reading it the first time, not after you have learned the whole book. The problem is that if a book has a lot of informal motivation, you have to cut the length of the book somehow, and often it is done by omitting some lengthy proofs.

On the other hand, sometimes a general theory exposition will be too focused on proving the right lemmas/definitions at the right time, and not give a feel for what the definitions mean or why this is a sensible direction of study.

Abstract. The other, doing mathematics, is the one where you're actually getting your hands dirty. Mathematicians are typically people who are great at doing math, asking the right questions, studying the right examples, having good insights. But this is very hard, in my opinion.  But, doing lots of homework problems, and asking questions about what your doing and why etc. are very helpful, because in a sense, that's how you learn to 'do math' as opposed to just reading math written down by someone else, say in a textbook, which is like learning it sort of differently (i guess the analogy might be, learning a language from a book vs learning a language by moving to a country where they speak only that).

I've found that one of the most important habits to understanding math is to understand how all the concepts you learn relate to each other in context. To that end I've found it immensely helpful to do the following exercise: close your book and notes and take out a piece of white printer paper. Now write down a half prose and half symbolic exposition of some part of your course material. Give proofs of the statements that are especially important. Try to show how each topic flows from the last. When you've done your best to do this, look at your book or notes and see what you missed. Studies have shown that effortful recall of material does much more to strengthen neural connections than just looking over your notes or text. And this exercise also forces you to weave together concepts in a holistic, meaningful way.  I can give you an example if this description isn't clear."

math,3btpo9,everything_is_bad,3,Thu Jul 2 01:53:10 2015 UTC,"Assuming you spin the bullet each time: You're repeating an experiment which has, each time, probability p = m/n chance of firing. One way to find the average (or ""expected"") number of turns (call it E) is to realize that there are two possibilities: If the gun fires, it just takes 1 turn, and if the gun does not fire, you're back where you started, so it will take an average of E + 1 turns. So:  E = p + (1 - p)(E + 1)  -> E = 1/p = n/m. (Or 6 turns, in the 1 bullet 6 chamber case).  If you do NOT spin the bullet each time, it is a little different. In this case there are (n choose m) possible ways to arrange the m bullets in the n chambers. One way to solve this is to figure out the explicit probability that the gun will fire for the first time on the kth turn: In that case one bullet will be in the kth slot and the other m-1 will be in higher slots, so the answer is ((n - k) choose (m - 1))/(n choose m).  The expected value is then:  E = sum_(k = 1)n k*((n - k)choose (m - 1))/(n choose m)  You can prove by induction that this equals:  E = ((n + 1) choose (m + 1))/(n choose m) = (n+1)/(m+1)  In the 1 bullet 6 chamber case, this equals 7/2 = 3.5 turns on average.  Since n >= m, you can show n/m >= (n + 1)/(m + 1), in other words a game where you spin the bullet each time will take longer on average, which is expected. But the effect is more pronounced when m is small. (If m = 1 for instance, one way gives E = n and the other gives E = (n+1)/2 which are pretty different)."

math,3brlyj,FrijjFiji,11,Wed Jul 1 22:06:00 2015 UTC,"You should use the proper term. They are cardinalities.  Infinity is a much more general concept than the measure of a size of a set. The set of real numbers between 0 < x < 1 has an uncountable cardinality, but other (arguably more important) aspects of it are entirely finite. (Such as its Lesbesgue measure: it has ""width 1"" as an interval). And for many purposes, the precise cardinality is much finer than we actually care about. (Who cares what kind of infinite a set is if we were hoping to capture that aspect of it with an integer?)  But as others have said. Yes. Cantor's Diagonal argument can be used to show that for any set S, the powerset of S has a strictly greater cardinality.   The proof is just as you would expect. Suppose each element s in S has a (unique) associated subset of S denoted σ(s). Then, you get this weird question you can ask about any element: Does its associated subset contain the element itself? In symbols, you can ask if s ∈ σ(s)?  You collect together all elements where the associated subset doesn't contain it. You get a subset P = {s ∈ S | s ∉ σ(s)}. (P for ""paradox""). And with this subset, we can pick out the element associated to it: p = φ-1(P).  The paradox comes up when you ask the question, Is p ∈ P? If so, then by the definition of P, p ∉ P, a contradiction. On the other hand, if p ∉ P, then again by definition of P, p ∈ P.   The conclusion is that your initial assumption, the existence of a bijection φ between S and its powerset, must be absurd."

math,3brlyj,ChalkboardCowboy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"No problem. I'll run through a somewhat disorganized technical explanation; feel free to ask for clarification of anything, but also feel free to check the wikipedia entry on anything I mention, which is almost certainly way more thorough and useful.  ""Ordinals"" are how we extend from the finite natural numbers into the transfinite. Formally, an ordinal is a set which is well-ordered by inclusion. The ordinals corresponding to ""0"", ""1"", ""2"", and ""3"" are {}, {{}}, {{},{{}}}, and {{}, {{}}, {{}, {{}}}}, which looks confusing until you realize that each ordinal is literally the set containing all the smaller ordinals. 0 is the empty set, 1 is {0}, 2 is {0,1}, and so on. This seems awkward and arbitrary at first, until you realize that the key property that makes ""three"" three is that of containing three parts. What's a good representation of something with three parts? Well, {0,1,2} seems appropriate. And so on. That gives us a nice set-theoretic way of representing all the natural numbers. Additionally, notice that the union of two of these sets is literally equal to whichever of the two sets corresponds with a larger number. Union = max, intersection = min (neat). This gives nice canonical representatives of sets of any finite size, but that's just the finite ordinals.  How do we get to infinite ordinals? What would be a good canonical representative of the countably infinite sets? Well, remember how the union of a collection of ordinals is the same as their max? If you take the union of all the finite ordinals, you get precisely {0,1,2,3,...}=N. Perfect! That's exactly what we wanted -- a set which is well-ordered under inclusion and has countably many elements. This ordinal is denoted ω (lowercase omega), the smallest infinite ordinal. There's no reason to stop here, though. We already established when defining the finite ordinals that each ordinal is the set of all the smaller ordinals, so the set containing any ordinal is the next largest ordinal (called its successor). This lets us define ω+1, ω+2, and so on. What's the set containing ω+n for all natural numbers n? ω+ω, of course, otherwise known as 2ω. Then we move on to 2ω+1, 2ω+2, ... 3ω, 3ω+1, 3ω+2, ..., 4ω, ... and eventually we get to the set containing nω+m for all natural numbers n and m, which is ω*ω, or ω2, and from here it's not much of a stretch to keep on going to arbitrary ordinals that look like ""polynomials"" with ordinal coefficients, ordinal exponents, and ω as the variable. The ordinals keep on going far beyond those, that's just the beginning, but after that it gets tricky to come up with convenient notation for them all.   Still with me? We haven't even said anything about ""size"" yet other than noticing that the finite ordinals have the same size (as a set) as the natural number they are meant to represent. Let's give that idea a name -- cardinality. The cardinality of a set is its ""size"", defined as follows (you're likely familiar with this part). Two sets are the same size if you can create a bijection between the elements of one and the elements of the other. {1,2} and {0,5} are the same size not just because you can visually see that they both have two elements, but literally because you can match up 1 with 0 and 2 with 5 and have no elements of either set left over. In the same way, the natural numbers and the even natural numbers are the same size because you can match every n with 2n and have nothing left unmatched on either side. So from here on, we're going to use ""cardinality"" in place of ""size"" when we want to evoke this technical meaning. The nice thing is that the definition of cardinality doesn't care one bit whether or not the things you're comparing are finite/countable/uncountable, it applies to all sets.   We went through all this trouble to define the ordinals, and by now you should see pretty quickly that a huge number of the non-finite ordinals are all the same size as each other, like ω and ω+3, since you can match ""0, 1, 2"" in ω with the ""+3"" part of ω+3, and then match ""3, 4, 5, 6, ..."" in ω with the ""ω"" part of ω+3. This should match up nicely with your intuition that adding 3 to infinity, or multiplying infinity by 2, or whatever doesn't change anything, it's still something with the same size as ω. Assuming you know what equivalence relations and equivalence classes are, they provide exactly the bridge we need to get from ordinals as a formal notion of infinite sets to cardinals as a formal notion of size. The cardinals are the equivalence classes of ordinals under the relation ""X has the same cardinality as Y"". For the finite ordinals, no other ordinal has the same size, so the finite cardinals are the same as the finite ordinals. But ω, ω+27, 4ω8+51ω3, and so on are all the same size -- namely, countably infinite, so they get collapsed to the same cardinal, which we call aleph_0, the smallest infinite cardinal.  Minor note: since cardinals are technically equivalence classes of sets, we really need a canonical choice of representative for each class, much like choosing 0,1,2,..,n as the canonical elements of the integers mod n. However, this is easy to do -- just take the least ordinal with the given cardinality, which we can do since the ordinals are, by construction, well-ordered. As noted by several other posts in this thread, you can easily generate a cardinal larger than any given one by taking the cardinality of its power set. You can do this as many times as you want, which quickly establishes countably many distinct infinite cardinalities, which are denoted beth_n for natural numbers n. You may have been expecting me to say that this gives you the sequence aleph_n, but in fact aleph_n might be less than beth_n for any given n. The continuum hypothesis (CH) says that 2^(aleph_0)=aleph_1, and the generalized continuum hypothesis says that 2^(aleph_n)=aleph_(n+1) for all n, but both of these statements are independent of ZFC (which is a whole new can of set-theoretic worms I'm not going to open). Since you know that the power set of any set has strictly larger cardinality, and you now have access to the ordinals as a way of iterating processes (not just the natural numbers), you can define beth_alpha in the same way for arbitrary ordinals alpha, not just beth_n for natural numbers n (and the same for the sequence aleph_alpha). This establishes pretty clearly that not only are there infinitely many infinite cardinalities, there are uncountably many. Pick your favorite uncountable set and let alpha be the ordinal representative of its cardinality. Then beth_0, beth_1, beth_2,... , beth_alpha is a sequence of alpha-many distinct infinite cardinalities. Warning: I'm using ellipses there like it were a countable sequence, but it isn't -- the only reason it's okay to do that is that we built the ordinals to be well-ordered.  Things are getting somewhat hairy somewhat quickly, now that we can use ordinals to index iterative processes. Notice that nothing stops us from doing this as many times as we want. What's (beth_2)^(aleph_aleph_aleph_...)? I don't know, some obscenely massive cardinal that humans aren't wired to intuitively grasp. Luckily, now we're ready to tackle why there are more cardinalities than any cardinal or ordinal can express. We probably could have done this several paragraphs ago, but whatever, I'm rambling through what seems relevant until I get to where I wanted to go. Suppose this weren't the case. Then there would be some way of describing how many cardinalities there were. How do we describe answers to the question ""how many""? With cardinals, of course! Okay, so let kappa be the cardinality of the set of cardinalities. Any cardinal comes equipped with a convenient ordinal representation (remember, kappa is really an equivalence class of well-ordered sets called ordinals), so let gamma be the ordinal for kappa. That means there are precisely gamma-many different cardinalities. Is that a problem? It sure is... We already went through both (1) a way of generating alpha-many different cardinalities for any ordinal alpha, and (2) a way of generating ordinals larger than any given ordinal. In particular, we know that gamma has a successor ordinal gamma+1, and taking the sequence of aleph numbers or beth numbers indexed by 1,2,3,...,gamma+1 provides more distinct cardinals than we assumed exist. And if gamma+1 doesn't work for some reason, certainly 2^gamma will, or something impossibly large like beth_gamma.   This more or less boils down to the fact that the ordinal numbers are ""too numerous"" to form a set. What does that mean? Well, suppose S were the set of all ordinals. Remember, ordinals are themselves sets well-ordered by inclusion. That means S is also well-ordered by inclusion... so S itself is an ordinal. This shouldn't be a surprise, it's exactly how we formed the ordinal ω (by taking the set of all the finite ordinals). But wait, if S is an ordinal, then so is the ordinal S+1, but S contains all the ordinals, so S+1 is contained in S, but S is contained in S+1 and they aren't the same, and oh bother we've broken the universe. So there's no set of all ordinals; the collection of all ordinals is called a proper class. This should be vaguely reminiscent of Russell's paradox which shows there's no set of all sets."

math,3brlyj,johnnymo1,2,Wed Jul 1 16:21:41 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, is there any infinite set smaller than the set of integers?   No. This is because N has the same cardinality of any of its infinite subsets. If A is an infinite set of natural numbers, there's a natural bijection between it and the full set of natural numbers: map 1 to the least element of A, 2 to the second least element of A, and so on. If a set has the same or a smaller cardinality than the cardinality of N, then it can be mapped to a subset of N. Thus, for a set to have a cardinality strictly smaller than the cardinality of N, it must be finite.  Moreover, the cardinality of N is smaller than the cardinality of any infinite set (besides countable sets, of course, which have the same cardinality). This follows from the fact that cardinalities of infinite sets are always comparable; that is, if you consider two infinite sets A and B, then either A has smaller cardinality than B, B has smaller cardinality than A, or they have the same cardinality. As we just argued there are no infinite cardinalities smaller than the cardinality of N, if an infinite set doesn't have the same cardinalty as N, it must have larger cardinality."

math,3brlyj,phyphor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:21:42 2015 UTC,"One simple example (without using the words ""power set"") of a set larger than R is the set End(R) (short for ""endomorphism"") of all functions from R to R. This includes, for example, the identity function, the zero function (all real numbers -> zero), the Cantor function, and one of the peculiar aspects of a set this large is that it's not even possible to define a ""typical"" member of End(R). In particular for any set S of real numbers we can define fS(x): {1 if x is in S; 0 otherwise}, which is also in End(R).   Any time we take the End() operation on a set S we get a larger set: the easiest way to prove this is to assume a bijection F: S <-> End(S) and then define the function g: S->S as g(x: x in S) = F(x)(x)+1. The right side of that equation looks weird, but remember that since F maps members of S to functions from S to S, F(x) is a function which is in End(S) and thus maps members of S to members of S. g is clearly in End(S), so F-1(g) must be in S. Then we have g(F-1(g)) = F(F-1(g))(F-1(g))+1 = g(F-1(g)) + 1, which is a contradiction because we never have x = x+1, of course. That means g can't exist, and since g is defined by F, F can't exist, so ||End(S)|| > ||S||.  But we can go further: the amount of possible cardinalities is actually undefinably inconstructibly huge (thanks /u/completely-ineffable ). You can define the functions from End(R) to End(R) as End(End(R)), which is larger than End(R), and so forth, but it turns out that there are also sets which are larger than any set produced by this construction.

At least what I've said kind of holds, as it still gives a bit of intuition.  &amp;nbsp;  (For appropriate c!)  A way to see this is that the norm on ℂ is multiplicative, so abs(zk) = abs(z)k.  Thus if z is on the unit circle, the limit as k goes to infinity is not well-defined, whereas abs(z)k is 1 for all k, and this gives the limit as k goes to infinity of abs(zk).  Similarly, if abs(z)>1, the limit explodes so no matter what c is, we can't stay in any bounded region, and if abs(z)&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;1, the limit as k goes to infinity of zk exists, and is 0, again by multiplicativity.  So if abs(c)&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;1, you can always conclude that the limit of the multibrot set with constant c contains the open unit disc, and is contained in the closed unit disc!

math,3bri7g,qamlof,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:25:36 2015 UTC,"I don't have any good sources, sorry. This is probably one of those sort of folklorist things that anyone working in the field thinks is obvious. This is just what I've figured out by thinking a little about it. I think the connection comes from looking at an abstract simplicial complex as a system of sets closed under subsets. You can identify subsets of your five element set using five Boolean variables. To match the definition of a monotone Boolean function we'll do the opposite of what you'd expect and say an element (point) is in the set (simplex) if its corresponding variable is 0. Our function then tells us if a given simplex is in the complex by returning 1. For instance, if our vertex set is {a,b,c,d,e}, the simplex {a,b,c} would be identified with the Boolean input 00011. If a monotone Boolean function evaluates to 1 for that input, then it had better also evaluate to 1 for the input 00111, for the face {a,b}. So the requirement of closure under subsets is captured by the requirement of monotonicity. There is one problem I've noticed with this correspondence, though: an arbitrary monotone Boolean function need not correspond to a simplicial complex that contains all the vertices. Somehow that isn't a problem though, since the Dedekind numbers give the right answer, but I'm not sure why.   And I've just realized that this also doesn't account for isomorphic simplicial complexes either. But maybe it's a start."

Therefore: [;2 = e^{\frac{p}{q}};] [;2^{q} = e^{p};]   We ignore the obvious case of p = q = 0 because p and q must be nonzero, lest we divide zero by zero.

To the extent that temperature is a measurement of a bulk property of e.g. the air, I think that it's a sufficiently fair assumption.  I think the main issue is that your 50/50 representation is non-physical.   Imagine some air volume determined by the cubic span over [(X1,Y1,Z1),(X2,Y2,Z2)], then take some differential motion in X so you end up with [(X1+dx,Y1,Z1),(X2+dx,Y2,Z2)]. If you measure the two temperatures of the volumes, they'll be differentially different with respect to said temperature. Obviously reality is granular, but since reality abhors discontinuities/vacuums, it seems reasonable to say that within the limits of human measurement, the conclusion is still valid."

Differential differences aren't required.  The abstract mathematical statement is this:  If f is a continuous function from the surface of a sphere to the real line, then there is a point p on the sphere such that f(p)=f(-p)."

The trick is to realize that the function is continuous AND periodic, by dint of it being on a sphere. If we have a situation where (for example) the temperature is 100C at the north pole (point A) and 0C at the south pole (point B), with random BUT CONTINUOUS differences between the two, then initially the difference between those two points (f(A)-f(B)) is 100C.  If you continuously move the two pointsthat you're measuring, maintaining their antipodal positioning, so that point A ends up at the south pole while point B is at the north pole, you end up with the situation that f(A)-f(B) is now -100C. By the intermediate value theorem, it's necessary that, at some point during the move, there was a point where the difference between the two points was 0, i.e. their temperatures were necessarily identical."

Of course, you could still live in some pathological universe where the types of allowable discontinuous temperature distributions are precisely those that have equivalent antipodal measurements for some pair of points, in which case the ""only if"" would then clearly become wrong.

There's also a game called ""chomp"", where two players share a rectangular array of chocolate squares. The bottom left one is poison,  and players' moves are to select some rectangle of squares which includes the top right corner of the original array and at least one remaining chocolate square. The loser is the person who eats the poison. The first player in this game also has a winning strategy, and the proof is easy: first note that they either have a winning strategy, or else their opponent does. If their opponent does, then the first player can make their first move be to eat the one square in the top right, and then employ their opponent's winning strategy for the rest of the game.

Well let's consider the function f(x)=1/n, the coordinates of this series are (1,1), (1/2;2), (1/3;3)... (1/n; n). The area if we just take the rectangles formed by the interval n times the value of 1/n they are always equal to 1/n. This is equal to the sum.    We know the sum must be bigger than the area of the function as the rectangles aren't actually the area of the graph. Let's consider the area of the graph, which is the integral of the function. f(n)=1/n implies F(n)=log(n).     As n approaches infinity, log(n) diverges to infinity.

For multi-linear algebra we should forego writing equations as strings, and instead use a graphical notation that makes the interchange law syntactical. It has been argued that not using a graphical notation is why it took so many decades to discover quantum teleportation.  Maybe in other contexts a Lisp like notation makes sense, too. But I fail to see an argument for why it should be uniquely preferred. It's very explicit. That's not necessarily an advantage for a notation.

As such it inherits their positive and negative traits. In programming that particular kind of macros are generally frowned upon. While they really can help you to be amazingly terse, they require much more in depth knowledge about the context, and tend to cause a much higher cognitive load than one can justify based on terseness alone.  I understand that mathematical notation probably is here to stay, but I can not even express how much I would appreciate to be able to read mathematical formulas without spending hours figuring out   exactly what the notation means.  For me, it is quite possible it could cut the time I need to learn new material to a third.  Programmers use to joke that some programming languages are ""write once"" languages. These languages are in general inviting/using too much operator overloading, having weak type systems, and last but not least - they tend to sport a powerful macro system.  I'm certainly not the best suited to make that call, but if you look at mathematics without having learned a particular subfield from the bottom up, it certainly appears that mathematical notation would be a ""write mostly once"" kind of language."

They are also not about writing proofs that can be modified by humans.  To get the ideas you need to read the text. There is no substitute.

One writes  (+ 4 5 6) = (+ 4 5 6)  and the notation incorporates the associativity just as with infix notation."

In all, this is simply a notation that is not as well adapted to the mathematical notions we want to express as the standard one.   One way to look at this is the following: Most of the examples: group composition, function composition, etc... form arrows in a category. And there is a (rather trivial) coherence theorem:  http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3347  Theorem 2.1 (Coherence for categories). A well-formed equation between two morphism terms in the language of categories follows from the axioms of categories if and only if it holds in the graphical language up to isomorphism of diagrams.  The graphical language he is talking about here is essentially the same as composition f \circ g \circ h .... which everything here is a special case of. This notation makes the axioms of category theory obvious tautologies, and that is powerful, because the axioms of categories capture the semantics of composition."

It's cluttered and throws away a perfectly sensible ability we can develop (a sense of operator precedence) for exactness.  Here's the trick, though. Ambiguity is rarely the issue you face.  It's true that for self-learners, it can be frustrating to find that you've been tripped up by ambiguous notation. But that is going to be a problem regardless of your syntax thanks to the high level of operator overloading you see in mathematical notation.   The thing is, you need notation not just to be exact, but you also need it to be memorable, to cut to the heart of the matter, and to be terse enough to scribble down in derivations. When I'm trying to work out a problem, I will throw away superscripts, subscripts, bounds. If it's an algebra problem, I will omit terms instead of writing them out if I feel they won't affect the answer. (If I can't get it correct by cheating, I can't get it correct at all).   There's a reason we don't write things like (= (plus (exp (times pi i) 1) 0). There are more parentheses than anything else. They also make it very easy to make mistakes. (For example, that last expression doesn't have all its parentheses matched. Did you notice the first read through?)  Learning the rules and the syntax is hard. I do wish there would be experiments to teach the concepts using expression trees (because that's really what an S-expression is about anyway). And to be fair, the ways we teach order of operations is pretty garbage. (PEMDAS is an eternal half-truth).  The examples you gave above in particular are not serious issues that need to be dealt with. The first is unambiguously equal to 4 by our standard conventions. (Although, I'm not sure where that is explicitly taught). The second is avoided by the convention that mathematical variables tend to be single letters. And even in cases where they are not, you can always pick out which is more likely: two variables named a and b respectively or one variable named ab. It's not so bad as in physics, where variables are often introduced implicitly and have a strong assumed interpretation.  The last is genuinely ambiguous, but only because it's a rare enough case that no convention has ever been established. At worst, you will have to ask the author or else work out the example yourself. Equations don't appear in isolation, so you can usually work out the derivation."

Here is one interesting question.  Consider the number a, which is algebraic. Let's say that a is a root of the order n polynomial P(x). Is there some way to go from a to a (rational?) generating function G(x) which generates a (integer?) sequence {g_n} such that  [; \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{g_{n+1}}{g_n} = a ;] ?   If there was some (rational) g.f. G(x), then in fact we have a whole equivalence class of such g.f.'s, because we can apply a lot of transformations to G and still get this property above. For example, we can scale the whole sequence (multiply G by a constant), shift the whole sequence left/right by an arbitrary amount (multiply G by various powers of x), add a constant to each term in the sequence (add c/(1-x) to G), etc. So if G with this property exists, clearly there is some equivalence class of (rational) generating functions that satisfy it, and we just have one representative.  Or here is another question. We take this same a which is a root of P(x). There are lot of rational g.f.'s we can form, e.g. [; R(x) = 1/P(x) ;]. What is the relationship between the coefficients of P(x) and the limit of ratios of successive elements of {r_n}?"
math,3bojrz,duetosymmetry,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:22:46 2015 UTC,"/u/snarkyxanf , /u/Bobshayd : to partially answer my own question, here is a relation I have found (through experimentation):  Let a be an algebraic number that is the root of some polynomial P(x) with integer coefficients[1]. Now let G(x) = 1/P(x) be a generating function, which gives the integer sequence {g_n}. Then if the limit [; \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{g_{n+1}}{g_n} ;] exists, it might have a shot at converging to 1/a.  I don't have a criterion for when it actually converges. As far as I can tell, this likes to converge to the reciprocal of the root of P(x) which has the largest magnitude (the reciprocal with largest magnitude, i.e. root of smallest magnitude, i.e. 1/x_j where |x_j|<|x_k| for all k), if it is real. It seems that if that root is not real, the limit does not exist (instead, successive ratios form a limit cycle). How quickly this converges seems to depend on how close the roots are in magnitude. The closer they are, the longer this takes to converge.  As an example, I picked out of a hat the polynomial P1(x)=1 + 2 x - 3 x^2 - 4 x^3. The reciprocals of the roots are {-1,(-1-√17)/2,(-1+√17)/2}. The second of these reciprocals is largest in magnitude. Successive ratios of the sequence generated by G1(x)=1/P1(x) converge to that second reciprocal.  As a second example, consider P2(x)=1 - 2 x - 3 x^2 - 4 x^3 (I just flipped the sign on the x1 term). The real root reciprocal with largest magnitude is  4/(-1 + (99 + 8 Sqrt[159])^(1/3)/3^(2/3) - 5/(3 (99 + 8 Sqrt[159]))^(1/3))   The other two are complex and smaller in magnitude. Now successive ratios of the sequence generated by G2(x)=1/P2(x) indeed converge to this above number.  I imagine that all of this can be proven by the asymptotic methods discussed in Wilf's generatingfunctionology, which is a great book (I have not looked at the asymptotic methods yet, but intend to).

The Fibonacci sequence satisfies a recurrence relation: every term is the sum of the last two. If you had a big decimal that encoded the Fibonacci numbers, it would have to satisfy the same recurrence relation, which can be written down by shifting the terms.  The Fibonacci numbers satisfy Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2.  Similarly, your decimal S must satisfy S = 10-24 S + 10-48 S. Multiplying by 10-24 is the same as shifting one term back.  Except, this equation is wrong because it fails for the first two terms, which in this case are 0 and 1. The RHS has first terms 0 and 0. To fix that, we just add 10-48 to the RHS, giving the equation  S = 10-24 S + 10-48 S + 10-48  Solve this equation and you get the number."

math,3bpdur,gammaStar,0,Wed Jul 1 02:08:15 2015 UTC,"Hi, I haven't read your description in detail, but a few cursory preliminary comments:  .  It may be best to try to come up with some terminology besides 'ring of sets' and 'field of sets' since these words have a different definition. Already 'field' has a definition in physics, e.g. the electric field, and in algebra, e.g. the endomorphisms of a one-dimensional vector space, or equivalently a ring in which every nonzero element has a reciprocal.  .  The question of whether the definition of a ring should by default require that every ring has an identity element is answered different ways by different people, but most conventions say that a 'ring' always has an identity element.  .  If X is a set, then a collection R of subsets closed under finite intersection and symmetric difference (including therefore the empty intersection which is all of R) is automatically a ring, where the multiplication operation is intersection and the addition operation is symmetric difference.   .  That ring is sometimes called a 'Boolean algebra' (another unfortunate term since 'algebra' has come to mean a ring with a structural map from another ring).   .  The topology on X where elements of R are considered to be open sets is totally disconnected and compact. Moreover, if R is just any ring in which every element satisfies x.x=x  there must be some totally disconnected compact space from which R arises in this manner (the Stone representability theorem).  .  None of these notions are really used much because in measure theory one usually wants to go past finite intersections and symmetric differences. And rings in which every element x satisfies x.x=x are not really representative of rings studied in algebra or geometry. The disconnectedness of the topology of X is a hint about this.  .  Totally disconnected compact spaces are interesting though. They are not actually necessarily discrete topologies (though the finite ones are) and examples are for instance the p-adic integers with the usual topology, for a prime p.  .  Everything I've described here is  just a matter of notation and terminology though. As I mention in the direction of measure theory one usually wants to go past these notions to considering infinite intersections&c, and in geometry one does not really want to assume that every function x satisfies x.x=x.  .  In fact you can think of the elements of R as 'characteristic functions' on X with values in the two-element field F_2, and they are characteristic functions of the open sets in the totally disconnected Hausdorff topology...."

Of course, a family of sets closed under finite union and intersection is just a lattice.

But here's a historical non-example that I've always enjoyed:  A 1960 paper of Wall established some interesting arithmetic properties of the Fibonacci numbers, and he conjectured that there were no primes p with the following property:   Every Fibonacci number that is divisible by p is also divisible by p2 .    In 1992, such primes became known as Wall-Sun-Sun primes (sometimes as Fibonacci-Wieferich primes), when Sun and Sun showed that if Fermat's Last Theorem was false, then it was false for an exponent which was a Wall-Sun-Sun prime.  In other words, the proof that Wall-Sun-Sun primes do not exist would also prove Fermat's Last Theorem.  In the 2000s, a series of estimates showed that a Wall-Sun-Sun prime would have to be fairly large, at least 17 digits.  But the standard conjecture now is quite the opposite of Wall's conjecture—it is widely believed that there are infinitely many Wall-Sun-Sun primes.  Despite the fact that we haven't found any, heuristics strongly suggest a distribution of these primes that is O(log log n), and grows just slowly enough that we will probably find our first one soon.  So this is not really an example of a conjecture that mathematicians currently believe could go both ways, but one for which the community has changed its mind a little."

The general form of this is a strong belief in the community, but it's unfathomably hard to show in any generality; the Riemann hypothesis is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this principle.  So it should be possible to write down a more-or-less arbitrary arithmetic property that holds for integers with low but nonzero probability, then conjecture that there are infinitely many primes with this property without necessarily being able to exhibit any."

Perhaps the best way to say it is with correlation: the sequence of prime numbers, while not random, generally correlates very poorly with other arithmetic sequences—for example, Dirichlet's theorem says that an arithmetic progression with common difference d contains prime numbers that are uniformly distributed throughout the phi(d) unit residue classes, with respect to the very natural Dirichlet density.  One major generalization of this theorem is the Chebotarev density theorem.  Terence Tao has written more than I can possibly access quickly on this subject, and the more general philosophies behind, for example, the prime number theorem and the Riemann Hypothesis.  Here are some lecture slides, where he writes (some paraphrasing):   The prime number theorem (first conjectured by Gauss and Legendre) is one of the landmark achievements in number theory.  The remarkable proof works, roughly speaking, as follows:  Step 1. Create a ""sound wave"" which is noisy at prime number times, and quiet at other times.  Step 2. ""Listen"" to this wave by taking a Fourier transform.  Each note that one hears (the zeroes of the Riemann zeta functions) corresponds to a hidden pattern in the primes.  Step 3. Show that certain notes do not appear in the music (this is tricky).  Step 4. From this (and tools such as Fourier analysis or contour integration), one can prove the prime number theorem.   There's lots more out there.  Suffice it to say that this is a very active area of research where the amount that we do not know vastly dwarfs the amount that we do."
math,3bok4z,SlipperyFrob,3,Wed Jul 1 07:04:04 2015 UTC,"A stronger supposition than P != NP that people have looked at is the Unique Games Conjecture, which is a bit wordy to describe but I'll take a shot at it below.  Consider the problem of determining if a graph is two-colorable (i.e. if you can color each vertex either red or blue in such a way that no two neighboring vertices share a color). This is actually quite an easy problem: for each connected component of the graph, first pick a starting vertex arbitrarily and color it blue (by symmetry, coloring it red doesn't change anything in the following). Since this vertex is blue, none of its currently-uncolored neighbors can be blue, so color each its neighbors red. Now for each of these neighbors, their neighbors can't be red, so color each of them blue. Eventually, you will have colored every vertex in the connected component, and a simple sanity check of your resultant coloring tests if you successfully 2-colored the graph. Further, it's easy to convince yourself that any two-colorable component will get successfully colored by this algorithm.  Okay, that was simple enough. After you chose your starting vertex, each edge forced you into making one (and only one) choice, so there was no serious thinking involved in how to color the vertices. Checking if a graph is two-colorable is therefore easy. But now suppose you want to check if a graph can be colored using 3 (or more!) colors. Now each edge gives you a choice. Next to a blue vertex, you may have either a red vertex or a green vertex. Now you have choices to make, and sometimes only one choice is the correct one. This makes the problem harder.   A lot harder.  NP-harder.  Okay, so 2-coloring is easy because the lack of choice, (3+)-coloring is hard because of all the choices involved. But what about the following problem: you still have k >= 3 colors, but each edge tells you what color one end point must be conditioned on your choice at another. For instance, if vertices u and v are connected, the edge might say ""u is blue iff v is green. u is green iff v is red. u is red iff v is blue."". Note that the lack of choice is bidirectional: once you choose a color for one endpoint, the color of the other endpoint is already predetermined.   This is now a many-color graph coloring problem, but it's still easy to solve: for each component, you can simply pick a vertex arbitrarily, color it with one of the colors, and see if the rest of the component can be colored without any edge constraint violations. If you succeeded -- great! Otherwise, try out another color until you exhausted them all. Just like the two-color case, it's easy to convince yourself that this problem is easy to solve.  So what was the point of the above wall of text?  The Unique Games Conjecturesays that although the above coloring problem is easy to solve when there is a valid solution, it's hard to find even somewhat-close-to-good solutions when the problem is just-barely unsolvable. That is, it says that there are classes of instances where 99.999% of the edge constraints are satisfiable, but no algorithm can satisfy even .0001% of them. In particular, it states that distinguishing between 99.999% satisiability of an instance and only .0001% satisfiability is NP-hard (assuming there is a sufficient number of colors available).  Whether it's true or not is pretty much in the air, and studying the problem has opened up many new areas of research, sometimes even leading to theorems completely independent of whether or not the conjecture is true. to has lead to many interesting questions in its own right. Curiously, people keep finding strong evidence supporting both the ""UGC is True"" camp and the ""UGC is False"" camp.

This skirts over the reason the conjecture is difficult in the first place, which is that you can reduce it to the case where the speeds and track length are integers.  The reason for this is that two runners whose speeds have an irrational ratio will, in a large enough time window, move independently of each other (thus creating more degrees of freedom to work with), while two runners whose speeds have a rational ratio will lock into a recurring pattern.  In fact, it seems that Terence Tao recently proved on his blog that we can bound the speeds of the runners, which means that this problem, for a given n, requires only a finite number of cases to be checked.  Tao echoes my sentiments, here:   The difficulty in this conjecture lies not with such “generic” situations, but rather with very special “arithmetically structured” situations in which the runner velocities all have a rigid relationship with each other (e.g. they are all rational multiples of each other with small height)."

My own view is that someone should not ask other people to read their paper on a subject until they have read at least one other person's paper on that subject.  Everybody wants to be read, nobody wants to read—as you can imagine, this produces a certain kind of strain.  I recommend reading the n=5 paper until you understand the approach that three professional mathematicians took in resolving this special case.

At the end, the probability of drawing a red or blue ball is the same as in our original problem. We are only deciding the color of the undecided ball after the drawing rather than before.

math,3bq1w1,Ukrainian_Reaper,6,Wed Jul 1 05:54:48 2015 UTC,"The word is determinant.   The determinant gets its name because its value determines whether a system of n linear equations in n unknowns has a solution.  Geometrically, the determinant is the oriented volume spanned by the vectors that make up the columns (or equivalently, the rows). This explains many properties. For instance, a matrix with two equal  vectors will span no volume. The ""oriented"" bit means that order of the columns matters. Any odd permutation of the columns (those which make an odd number of swaps) will cause the determinant to change sign. And lastly, scaling any column by a constant will cause the determinant to scale by the same amount. Scaling the entire matrix will scale the determinant by the nth power of that value (where n is the dimension of the matrix).  The determinant is actually very central to the very notion of defining exactly what we mean by orientation in geometry. And it is related to many ideas which are based on orientation. For instance, the cross product of two vectors u and v is naturally defined as the linear functional which eats a vector w and then gives back the determinant of the matrix with columns u, v, and w. (This is why the horrid trick engineers use to take the cross product works). Again, related to this, some people define differential forms in terms of determinants (if you happen to know what those are... they are a kind of tensor).   The determinant is one of those things that is a little less than a miracle. I don't know its history. I would love to hear from someone who knew more about it. But all I can do is speculate how long it took for people to come to the modern notions we have today.  But for 2x2 matrices, you should be able to justify why the determinant works with a straightforward algebraic argument. After that, you are best to just marvel at how useful they are, and learn their properties thoroughly."

The other half of the hyperbola is given by the equation v = -c*sqrt((a*c)2 + u2), and the whole hyperbola is encompassed with the equation u2 + (v/c)2 = (a*c)2.  Perhaps you are more used to seeing a hyperbola expressed in a different form?

How does   showing that the partial sums contain the triangular numbers is the same as showing that the digits can be grouped to form 1, 2, 3, etc.   Note, I get the argument about the period of 6 elements in the digit sequence (which add to 15) allows us to add multiples of 15 to the next required number in the grouped sequence by grouping the sample multiple of 6 digits.  Where do the triangle numbers help? For example: I can see that the triangle number 153 is a n=10 number (153=n*15 +3).  So in the 153rd number in the grouped-digit sequence, I will have 61 digits, either starting with or ending with a 3.

So now we just have to figure out what the triangle numbers are mod 15, which we can easily do by just plugging in each possible n from 1 to 15 and reducing mod 15. For example, for n = 10, we can see that the 10th triangle number is 55, which is 10 mod 15, which is in our list.

math,3bjk2a,thebhgg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:02:17 2015 UTC,"Hm, the other answers had good hints, but were a bit unclear I think ... Here's my two cents:  This'll be a 3 part proof using modus ponens and induction.  Definitions  Let A = (1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2)**  Let A' be the infinite sequence which repeats A.  Let S(A) be the statement that ""A' can be partitioned into a sequence of sequences (b_1, b_2, ...) where the sum of the elements in b_n is equal to n.""  Let S'(A) be the statement that ""For every triangular number T_n, there exists an index c_n in A' where sum of all elements from the start of the sequence to c_n is equal to T_n""  Claim 1: S(A) is equivalent to S'(A).  Proof 1: If we had the sequence (b_1, b_2, ...), then we just take the index of the last element in b_n as our c_n.  E.g. if we have (1), (2), (3), (4), (3, 2) then c_5 would be 6 since 2 is the last element in (3, 2) and is at index 6 in the entire sequence.  For the reverse direction, if you had a cn for each triangular number, then you define your sequence b_n to start from index ""c(n-1) + 1"" and end at index c_n.  Okay, before we move on, let's chat about this special sequence A.  It's actually the non-zero partial differences of the sorted triangle numbers mod 15:   1, T_1 = 1, T_1 mod 15 = 1 2, T_2 = 3, T_2 mod 15 = 3 3, T_3 = 6, T_3 mod 15 = 6 4, T_4 = 10, T_4 mod 15 = 10 5, T_5 = 15, T_5 mod 15 = 0 6, T_6 = 21, T_6 mod 15 = 6 7, T_7 = 28, T_7 mod 15 = 13 8, T_8 = 36, T_8 mod 15 = 6 9, T9 = 45, T mod 15 = 0 10, T_10 = 55, T_10 mod 15 = 10 11, T_11 = 66, T_11 mod 15 = 6 12, T_12 = 78, T_12 mod 15 = 3 13, T_13 = 91, T_13 mod 15 = 1 14, T_14 = 105, T_14 mod 15 = 0 15, T_15 = 120, T_15 mod 15 = 0   Sort these guys and we get 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 10, 10, 13  Let's tack on a 15 to the end just to complete the cycle: 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 10, 10, 13, 15  If we take the partial differences (differences between neighboring terms), we get: 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 2  Now remove the zero's and we get: 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2  Intuitively, these partial differences are exactly the ""smallest"" set of numbers needed to us from any Ti to it's neighbor T(i+1).  Some things which we'll need later:  Claim 2: Sum of elements in A are equivalent to 0 mod 15.  Proof 2:  I'll handwave a bit for this one, and leave the rigorous proof to the reader, but basically we're dealing with partial differences of triangular numbers mod 15.  Forget the mod 15 part for now, and we're dealing with partial differences of triangular numbers.  Partial difference of consecutive triangular numbers would just be the numbers from 1 to 15, and we can use the N * (N + 1) / 2 trick which shows us that the sum of elements in A is definitely equivalent to 0 mod 15.  Okay, on to the fun part!  Claim 3: S'(A) is true.  Proof 3:  Let's use induction.  Let P(n) be the statement that ""For a positive integer n, there exists an index c_n in A where the sum of all elements from the start of the sequence to c_n is equal to T_n"".  Base case: We'll need to show that P(T_i) is true for i from 1 to 15.  Inductive Step:  Assume P(n), then we'll prove P(n + 15).  Claim 3a: T_(n+15) is the same mod 15 as T_n  Proof 3a:  Couple ways to do this but the easiest is probably to use the property of triangular numbers:  Ta + T_b + ab = T(a+b)  So, let's fix 15 for b and re-arrange some terms:  Ta + T_15 + 15 * b = T(a+15) T15 + 15 * b = T(a + 15) - T_a  Since 15 definitely divides T_15 (remember N * (N + 1) / 2), and 15 divides 15 * b, then 15 must divide the right hand side, and we know they are equivalent to 0 mod 15, i.e. differ by some multiple of 15.  Okay, now to prove the inductive step.  Assume that we have some P(n).  We want to show P(n + 15).  By the inductive hypothesis, we have a cn which gets us to T_n.  From Claim 3a, we know P(n) and P(n+15) differ by some multiple of 15.  From Claim 2 we know that the sequence A sums to 15.  So, our c(n+15) can be found by tacking on cycles of A to cn until we reach T(n+15).  q.e.d.  To prove this generically for any K aside from 15, we just need to replace the base case in the proof with a more rigorous explanation of the partial differences part.  One might ask, why remove the 0's?  Well, you don't have to, you can leave them in actually.  One might ask, why do we sort before taking partial differences?  This is to ensure that we always account for the ""minimal"" possible gap between any of the value mod K."

You are working in the model, not the axiomatic theory. Consequently, you can non-constructively prove theorems by the law of the excluded middle (which goes pretty much directly against Euclid's core ideas.)  Doing synthetic geometry is no more lacking in rigour than doing coordinate algebra — the mere existence of an isomorphism between axiomatic constructions and thier coordinate-algebraic interpretations, along with the fact that synthetic geometry is by definition inductively generated, gives you all the rigour you could get from eschewing synthetic methods all together.  The interesting bit in Cartesian methods is that you can contrast and compare different sets of axioms: see for instance the Huzita–Hatori axioms of origami.  TL;DR: giving a purely set-theoretical Cartesian overview of geometry is not very interesting, because Euclidian methods is an axiomatic theory to which Cartesian methods is a set-theoretic model."

Let's ignore all of that.  You want your friend to get some amount of resource, which we'll call r.  You send some stuff, s, which is taxed, at a rate t, and they get:  r = s - st   Where 0 < t < 1  You might see the rate given as a percentage but it's trivial to convert from decimals to a percentage and back.  We know what we want the person to get (r) and the tax rate (t). so we need to rewrite the formula so the knowns are on one side, and the unknown is on the other.  The first thing to do is re-write the formula so it's factorised:  r = s(1-t)   And then it's trivial to write it so all the knowns are on the side we want them to be:  r / (1-t) = s   So if the tax rate is 50%, t = 0.5, and if your friend wants 1000 wood, s = 1000, so you will need to send:  1000 / (0.5) = 2000   which makes sense, because if you are taxed half then sending 2000 of something will mean only 1000 gets there.  What about for more complicated numbers? Say tax is 12% and your friend wants 63 food:  63 / (1-0.12) = 63 / 0.88 = 70.45....
