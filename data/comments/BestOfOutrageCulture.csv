That the heels continued acting like heels, or that there's a whole movement that's out to smear the good name of GG before they become a threat to people who are ruining gaming forever with their views that maybe there is more room for gaming narratives beyond some of the lazy fallback tropes that even the best games have used in the past?  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gamergate  There's a whole bunch of citations at the bottom.

We can collect all the stories of people who have been subjected to doxxing, SWATting and harassment, but they don't count because they're obviously biased. We can get sources from the outlets that have been covering this, but they're all biased because the media is out to get Gamergate because they're scared of their ethics (let's conveniently forget that Kotaku has covered ethics breaches much more faithfully than most in the industry. They even covered the WB incident and Ubisoft embargo more than Gamergate did. And don't even bring up ""But Totalbiscuit!"" because GG and TB only got on board after Forbes of all places called them out on it).   So what exactly qualifies as evidence if not any of this?   Also: as an aside; if taunting gamers and disparaging geeks is enough to have you disbarred from the argument - why is Milo still hailed as one of the great public heroes of Gamergate? It was scant months before that he was labelling gamers as pathetic manbabies who couldn't get a woman."
BestOfOutrageCulture,3dqzp0,AntonioOfVenice,-6,Mon Jul 20 00:33:06 2015 UTC,"Remember when I said there was always an inevitable No true Scotsman defence?   You already acknowledged that anyone (including GNAA and SJWs) can go post in the Gamergate hashtag. So I think you have to provide some actual evidence. Of course, whenever SJWs try to post 'evidence', it always turns out to be not TheHat2 or Sargon posting 'harassment', but some egg account that doesn't even use the GG-hashtag.   Ironic, the same people who claim that terrorists loudly screaming ""Allahu Akbar"" have nothing to do with Islam use completely different standards for people they don't like. Anything bad happening (alleged or real) to anyone GG dislikes is automatically our fault. This is rank dishonesty. Do you have no interest in truth whatsoever?   But have you got any evidence yourself that SJWs are defaming GG in this way?   Yes. Devin Faraci of the BadassDigest called us worse than ISIS. Jason Schreier of Kotaku compared us to Ebola. Just to give two examples.   When you have a movement that started purely as a revenge kick against an ex (on claims that have been proved to not only be untrue   Eron Gjoni was abused, emotionally manipulated and cheated on by Zoe Quinn. He wanted to inform the world that this person was extremely abusive. Claims have been proven to be untrue? You better tell Stephen Totilo and Nathan Grayson of Kotaku, because they acknowledged it.   aimed purely at a neoreactionary element that already had a name for deliberately targeting feminists    God forbid that anyone dissent from a movement that targets scientists for wearing a shirt they don't like! These neoreactionaries actually believe that scientists should be able to wear what they want? Don't tell me what to wear, tell Dr. Matt Taylor!    Rationalwiki   Article on GG written by Ryulong, a guy who was banned from Wikipedia for his dishonesty, and literal bribe-taking. That is your source. Whether it's true doesn't matter to you.   Bonus points - the dumping of the full logs later by GG in an attempt to overwhelm people poring through them was what exposed NotYourShield as an astroturf.    If you had searched for Gamergate on Twitter even once, you'd have noticed out many minority members (including myself). Stop regurgitating whatever Ryulong tells you and open your own eyes. Stop listening and believing and ask for some evidence. (You never will.)   We can collect all the stories of people who have been subjected to doxxing, SWATting and harassment,    Where is your proof? Nero, Sargon and Boogie were doxxed by anti-Gamergate. Our DC meetup was sent a bomb threat and SWAT'ed. By your own standards, proof that you are evil.   let's conveniently forget that Kotaku has covered ethics breaches much more faithfully than most in the industry   BAHAHAHAHAHA! Kotaku, whose Editor-in-Chief Stephen Totilo was defending the outing of a gay man at the behest of a blackmailer? You believe that to be ethical? Dear God. No wonder you hate Gamergate.    Also: as an aside; if taunting gamers and disparaging geeks is enough to have you disbarred from the argument - why is Milo still hailed as one of the great public heroes of Gamergate?    He saw the true nature of gamers and changed his mind.    But let's face it - no evidence will be enough here, will it?    No evidence is more than enough for you - that's the exact amount of evidence that you have. I ask again: Where is this 'proof' for doxxing and threats of yours, which you claimed was 'all over the place'? 11 months of lies and libel by the gaming media, and you literally have nothing. Nothing. Zilch. Nada. Screaming 'neoreactionary' does not help your cause, it only shows that you have no proof. Turns out the banned Wikipedia admin wasn't the best source! Turns out a Newsweek-'writer' who supports bullying and compares gamers to the Klan isn't particularly reliable!  This is embarrassing. I feel bad for you. If I wanted to lie about a movement, I'd make sure to at least have some evidence for my claims.  What we are: Despite mass censorship on Reddit, 4chan and many other sites, we persevered and forced Polygon, Kotaku, Escapist, Gameranx and several others to enact new ethics policies. Despite cries of ""Gamers are dead"" and ""bring back bullying"", we raised money for starving children and anti-bullying campaigns. We were the ones who stood with Charlie Hebdo when people like Jonathan McIntosh were pissing on murdered cartoonists. We provided a safe space for a black developer who was attacked by SJWs for using the term 'mechanical apartheid'. We were the ones exposing Gawker for what it is and contacting its sponsors long before any SJW raised an objection to how horrible it is. Despite bias and libel on a massive and unprecedented scale, 11 months in and we're still here, and growing at a steady pace. We're not going anywhere. Get used to us."

They claim that people of color are so inferior to whites that they can't compete on a level playing field. Which is why an SRS analysis of Gamergate called us biased against minorities, because we believe in meritocracy. That only makes sense if you believe minorities have no merit.   And   For what it's worth, here are my qualifications for defining a SJW:    Pro-collectivism, anti-individualism  Demonization of opponents as unrepentant bigots  Anti-intellectualism  Belief in collective guilt   If there's ever a question as to whether someone really is a SJW, it may be instructive to see how they measure up against these traits.   The problem with your standards is that most if not all authoritarian movements satisfied all four. Racists pretty often believe on all four, so are conservative (socially) puritans and so did church. To escalate it, Nazi, as in real historical nazi, did. So did communists, so did genocidal regime in Rwanda.   So this applies to all kinds of horrible people? Doesn't strike me as a problem.

That's not collectivist, that's as individualistic as it gets. But I guess being called out for a random sexist joke is anti-individualist.   Demonization of opponents as unrepentant bigots   Hypocrisy abounds. GamerGate labels ""SJWs"" as evil almost constantly. ""SJWs"" are supposedly an omnipresent threat.  As far as I know, few ""SJWs"" actually think that every MRA, every GamerGator, every Chimpire member is irredeemably evil. There is capacity to forgive and forget in social justice, and there is capacity to believe that people can change and make mistakes.  Admittedly, activist movements sometimes forget that nobody is infallible. But it is a common mistake.   Anti-intellectualism   Hoo boy. Let's talk about GamerGate's favorite person to parade around when they want to say how bad ""SJWs"" are.  Matt Taylor, the comet landing guy who wore a shirt that wasn't right for a professional dress code. Going back to point 2, I'm pretty sure at this point most people have chosen to leave him alone because he made a mistake. There is no one chasing him around like an Erinyes constantly shaming him for wearing that shirt. The only people bringing it up are GamerGators.  If ""SJWs"" were anti-intellectual, he would have had his publications erased, his CV shredded, and he would have been totally exiled from the scientific community. As far as I know, he still has his job.   Belief in collective guilt   No such belief exists. This is merely projection of ""SJWs"" saying things like ""men should take some responsibility to fight sexism"" or ""white people should take responsibility to fight racism"" and then stretching it out to the belief that ""SJWs"" want majorities to constantly flagellate themselves like a band of penitents.   The problem with your standards is that most if not all authoritarian movements satisfied all four.   Except that OP was trying on purpose to equate SJWs with authoritarians.

If you'd like this to be clarified in more depth, this video may be helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhkXpdD8aVw  If you would like to learn more about how Capitalism is hierarchical, here is a much broader (shorter) video explaining it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLNW0sZKYhU  Hope this is helpful.

BestOfOutrageCulture,3do6ax,numberonepaofan,11,Sat Jul 18 02:07:22 2015 UTC,"The two big differences for me are that for one, ancaps practically worship private business, to the point that they often refuse to truly recognize how larger corporate interests participate in the oppressive statist culture. Agorists respect private enterprise but many also recognize the harm it can cause should people not keep a wary eye on it. Ancaps think the state is the root of all evil but refuse to accept the reality that private businesses are also capable of doing awful things.   Agorists also tend to care about social justice issues. Go to /r/agorism and you'll see that the moderators have set it up as a safe space; blatant racism/queerphobia/etc. isn't permitted. /r/anarcho_capitalism, on the other hand, has the typical redditor circlejerk over how wonderful free speech is, all the while it slowly gets taken over by neo-nazis and bigots."

For a lot of these lonely men, I don't think they necessarily want to hate the things the group as a whole hates. But they get such an angry reaction from outsiders, and thus have their group choice reinforced because this just reminds them of past rejections. Probably the only way to reach these people is with a kind word instead of the normal hostility one has towards any member of these hateful groups."

In Social Justice circles, probably - to the point where SJW Freddie Deboer has written a blog piece about it: http://fredrikdeboer.com/2015/05/13/maybe-time-for-change/  I totally understand why you'd be outraged at the suggestion that whites are the victims of racism. I'd have laughed at the idea a year ago too. But that was before people started calling me 'white' as some sort of insult. And it's not as if SJWs are only biased against whites, they have very 'problematic' attitudes towards non-whites as well. It was a SJW analysis of Gamergate that said GG is biased against minorities, because it supports meritocracy. Because obviously, minorities have no merit.   idea that Gamergate protesting the handful of sites that write about social issues relating to gaming is ""fighting the status quo""    It's basically everyone in the gaming press, save the Escapist and IGN.

That's not ""Genetic Fallacy"", dude. There are no ""genes"" to have been ""passed on"", because it's all the same people involved.   I hope this was trolling. Genetic comes from the Greek. It refers to beginning (cf. Genesis), not genes. Thus, the genetic fallacy is bringing up something's beginning state as though it were relevant for today.

We've raised tens of thousands of dollars for an initiative promoting female developers, fighting tuberculosis and feeding starving children. We've stood for freedom of speech when our enemies were screaming 'je ne suis Charlie'. We provided a 'safe space' for a black developer who was viciously slandered by SJWs as a racist for using the term 'mechanical apartheid'. We've at least delayed the SJW co-opting of gaming. Our number of supporters continues to grow, despite being called every name in the book and a 24/7 media libel campaign.  I am like them. I am like TotalBiscuit, Thunderf00t and TheHat2.

Affirmative action laws (in the US at least, I don't have experience with other countries) have had little to no effect on white privilege, and are for the most part simply anti-discrimination laws. In the US at least, there is no state in which it is legal to take race in account in hiring practices, for either excluding people of color or excluding whites.  The only place in which affirmative action can be said to discriminate against whites is in university admissions, and even there it has not gotten to a point in which people of color outnumber whites in universities. White university students are still the majority in the US, as of 2009, according to the Census.  http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0286.pdf  Affirmative action has rarely, if ever, been enacted by people of color. Throughout its history, it's been pushed by the white, male politicians who make up the majority of Western political institutions. It was not the influence of people of color that effected affirmative action, it was the realization of politicians that they couldn't get away with tolerating discrimination anymore. And it has not done nearly enough to correct the racial disparity in society.   According to your claims, Coontown is not racist, because it has neither power nor prestige.   First of all, I said people without power or prestige do not contribute to societal racism. They can still be racist.

The only place in which affirmative action can be said to discriminate against whites is in university admissions, and even there it has not gotten to a point in which people of color outnumber whites in universities.    I am pretty sure ""people of color"" don't make up 39.2% of the population, so they are overrepresented in universities. Nothing wrong with that, as long as it's based on qualifications. I now see that this is just disabled students. The question is discrimination based on race, not who ends up being the majority.   It was not the influence of people of color that effected affirmative action, it was the realization of politicians that they couldn't get away with tolerating discrimination anymore.    I'd argue that affirmative action is institutionalizing discrimination.   First of all, I said people without power or prestige do not contribute to societal racism. They can still be racist.

I'm white and I never get called white as some sort of insult.

There is more policing of black neighborhoods, but that's because there is more crime in those neighborhoods, so I'm not going to blame them for that. If black lives matter, then we should support the police - because murders in Baltimore have increased by nearly 50% compared to last year.

But I'll be the first to admit they could certainly do for some expanding.   there is no denying that it is institutionalized racism   Oh I absolutely would deny that. Because affirmative action does not discriminate against whites. Quotas are explicitly illegal. You strike me as someone who sees AA as some sort of boogeyman and knows very little about how it actually functions. I highly suggest you do some googling.

This right here is why people dismiss you for having ""white opinions"". No one who has spent any time living in a poor black neighborhood would possibly say this. Listen to me because this is important: police officers do not treat black people or neighborhoods the same as they treat white people and neighborhoods.   Here is a fantastic interview with an ex-Marine and ex-Baltimore police Sergeant about the culture in that particular police department. I highly suggest you listen to it. You'll learn a lot.   You and I both grew up in a bubble. A bubble where we believed the world was an overall just and fair place. Where all the ugliness of sexism and racism are behind us. For most people who are women or minorities, this bubble is popped as they grow up. One day they experience these forces and realize how unjust the world is. But for us, because this world caters to us, we have the ability to go our entire lives without ever popping that bubble. A lot of stuff has been going on lately that is challenging the bubbles of a lot of white people.   I urge you: pop your bubble. The reason so many people are complaining about racism and sexism is not because those people are ""professional victims"" or want to ""play the race card"", it's because they experience those things. Actual, real people - not just usernames on a web forum - experience those things. When Anita Sarkeesian says she doesn't feel safe, it's because she's legitimately frightened. She actual receives death and rape threats all the time. You don't have to agree with every single she says, but critically consider them. When comedians from Richard Pryor all the way up to Dave Chappelle all have bits about police beating the hell out of black people, they do it because it's true. They've seen it and in some cases experienced it."
BestOfOutrageCulture,3dlray,bigDean636,-8,Fri Jul 17 19:42:50 2015 UTC,"And the reason is because black people are uniquely disadvantaged because of their race. A poor white teenager is certainly disadvantaged, but it's not because he is white.    Sure they can be. Imagine two families: one black, one white. They earn as much and their kids are of equal intelligence. They work equally hard. Under affirmative action, the white kid will be disadvantaged because of his race, based on the assumption that the black kid has been disadvantaged in some other way, which may or may not be true.   Oh I absolutely would deny that. Because affirmative action does not discriminate against whites. Quotas are explicitly illegal.    You don't need to have quotas to discriminate. If you have lower standards for some group, then you are discriminating against other groups. And it's not just whites who dislike affirmative action: http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/17/us/harvard-asian-americans-discrimination-complaint/   Listen to me because this is important: police officers do not treat black people or neighborhoods the same as they treat white people and neighborhoods.    Is that because of the skin color of the people involved, or is that because black neighborhoods have more crime? Of coures black neighborhoods will be policed more if they have more crime, and that is a good thing, because it saves black lives. I do not just care about the black kids shot by the police.   You and I both grew up in a bubble. A bubble where we believed the world was an overall just and fair place. Where all the ugliness of sexism and racism are behind us.    And you know why that is? It's not because we're both white, because we're not. It's because of our green privilege. We both grew up in a good neighborhood. That is the only thing that matters.    The reason so many people are complaining about racism and sexism is not because those people are ""professional victims"" or want to ""play the race card"", it's because they experience those things.   In some cases, it's because they experience racism or sexism, and in other cases, it's because they are professional victims and race-baiters. The black students whose grammar was corrected at UCLA were not the victims of racism. A scientist wearing a shirt is not ""sexism"". Tumblr's garbage is not legitimate racism or sexism.  Folks like Obama and John McWhorter pointing out that people regard them as thieves simply based on the color of their skins, that's worthy of one's concern.   When Anita Sarkeesian says she doesn't feel safe, it's because she's legitimately frightened.    If she were legitimately frightened, she'd stop baiting trolls and stop encouraging them by giving them attention. Everyone on the internet gets death threats. Everyone. Only a few professional victims try to monetize them, and to play the victim. When you can't produce anything other than victimhood, how do you want people to respond to you?   When comedians from Richard Pryor all the way up to Dave Chappelle all have bits about police beating the hell out of black people, they do it because it's true.    I don't doubt that. That should be dealt with. Preferably in a way that will not lead to a massive murder spike like the one Baltimore is experiencing right now. That will cost more black lives, and I'm not OK with that."

Or the occasional doxxing that probably wouldn't of happened without all of these subreddits that pin people up on a wall of shame.   Imagine too that you speak your mind on something somewhere on reddit and you start getting shamed by maybe thousands of people on one of the shame subreddits for what you said. Would you be as comfortable speaking about that opinion anymore? Even if you thought you were 100% sure of yourself and KNEW you were completely right and that nothing could change your mind?  Well if you're less comfortable speaking that opinion again, there go a lot of potential opportunities for other people to criticize you and refute whatever your view is and whatever you might be saying. Hopefully the view is a good one and based on fact, because it's gonna be exposed less often.

If it wasn't totally counterproductive and hypocritical it would maybe be fun to have a subreddit pointing out things people say on here and other shame subreddits where they think they're taking a stand for good when they're obviously just enjoying feeling superior to other humans or are actually being counterproductive. But shaming anybody like that is pretty gross and I would likely just find all of the content on a subreddit like that frustrating and stupid for just about every reason.

I mean I always see people get really mad about how often they see bigoted comments on their front page, and I don't read the comments on the default subreddits very often partially because of that. So it's not like you have to seek them out.  Why do you have to make a very public totally separate shame wall that might make a racist less likely to reveal their ideas in public in the future for fear of extended harassment/doxxing/whatever, and therefore make it less likely that people continually discuss them, continually reinforce them as wrong, and maybe change the persons ideas.  In my mind all these shame subreddits are making it less likely that important things like racism and other bigotry are talked about seriously and less likely that the opinions of bigots will be exposed and changed. There's also the potential added bonus of bigots being able to claim victimhood based on their beliefs being shamed for more perceived legitimacy.

So you can ignore my last comment.   I don't think that this idea that they'll be less inclined to reveal their ideas because of what we do. Far from it - you can see what happens whenever SRS links one of the comments. People shout louder about SRS, about their bigoted ideas, about everything.    Which can be a great gut reaction argument to sway ignorant people to your way of thinking.   People will always be able to sway ignorant people who don't listen to both sides of the story.   This subreddit and it's kin really seems like they're about people enjoying feeling superior to other people. Not fixing things.   Kinda. It's also a place where we can safely say what we want without the ridiculous circlejerk blowing up our inboxes. If we reply to the original comment, oftentimes we are the ones who are harassed (via PMs) and downvoted to oblivion. That type of discussion does not feel worthwhile to have and is very tiring and not at all what most of us are looking for.

Now I don't watch cuckold/NTR porn, but from what I know the general story line is woman already involved with a weak, ""beta"" man decides to fuck another man (typically a black guy). (I could be wrong)  I can only guess that ""cuck"" feels so damaging to them because it implies that the men who support things like feminism are ""weak"" and ""unmanly"" and not reining in their woman like real men are supposed to. The men who fight racism are also implied to be ""weak"" in that they aren't keeping the sexually proficient black people down.

The point is to allow those viewpoints to be expressed at all, and the internet as it exists in the US is already far more than sufficient for that.

Sure, but I doubt you have the answer, I think I'd be better served by looking into psychologists' take on it.   Women that ""don't need no man"" and are all knowing and all powerful beings (apparently) are going out of their way to try to be something they aren't to prove some point no one really cares about.   My parents split when I was 13, and that sure doesn't sound like my mom.   ""Without feminism, you wouldn't even be allowed to leave your house! Look at Iran!"" shouted Pepper with the red armpit hair, lighting her bra on fire.   Thank you for specifying the colour of your straw feminist's armpit hair, that really was important.   But this is the United States. I can vote now. I can leave my house without acid being thrown on me. So go fight in Iran then.   ""The situation isn't perfect but it's worse somewhere else, go fix that! Even if you don't have the means to do so!""   And why can't being a mom/wife be empowering?   DAE radfems are only feminists?! Fuck's sake, I can count the number of people I know who've actually said stuff like that on 0 hands. And I took a course titled ""Philosophy of Gender and Sexuality!""   I feel like it would be a lot better than being a corporate slave. No one laid on their deathbed saying ""I'm so glad I worked my ass off all these years, I wish I worked more.""   And you know what? I agree. But I'm a dude, so traditional gender roles expect me to be a 9-5er in either a soul-sucking office job or back-breaking manual labour job providing for my wife and 1.5 children. Fuck that. Not least of which because I'm gay and don't want children.   It just feels like to me these women have created these monsters to fight when, honestly (in the US anyway) oppression was there and now it isn't anymore, but they just have to keep finding things to be angry at. Now it's gender roles and women are looking less like women and more like some inbetween shit that guys don't even find attractive.   Dude, nobody appointed you arbiter of what guys find attractive.

BestOfOutrageCulture,3dcvh6,benzimo,5,Wed Jul 15 17:54:12 2015 UTC,"Armchair theory: Part of being a reactionary is either an inability to recognize or an ability to ignore structural inequality--they really, truly believe--or are able to act as if they believe--we live in a Just World with a Level Playing Field.  In a Just World with a Level Playing Field, what you get out of life is equivalent to what you, as an individual, put in. But then there are these people advocating for ""social justice"", saying (or at least the reactionary is hearing) that various minorities are falling behind and need (what the reactionary calls) special privileges.  But this is a Just World with a Level Playing Field! Since these SJWs think minorities need some special considerations, or even some active help in progressing, they must think that minorities are incapable of putting in the work that's needed to advance. And SJWs, therefore, are the real bigots who think minorities just aren't as good as (ahem) normal people.  If you start with a faulty premise, you end up with faulty results. Ever notice how the reactionaries who claim to be paragons of ""logic and reason"" never, ever include the essential components of ""observation and analysis""?"
BestOfOutrageCulture,3dcvh6,mattwan,6,Wed Jul 15 19:46:38 2015 UTC,"Nah, I don't buy it. This is the kind of story they might spin if pressed, but I don't think it's what's animating them. For one thing they mainly believe that ""SJWs"" are bigoted against straight white cis males; the accusations of ""normal"" racism, classism, whatever are there, but they're far from central.  I think it's good to start with the fact that reactionaries in general don't spend their time calling ""SJWs"" ""bigoted."" A ""race realist"" doesn't care if you're bigoted; if anything they'd say ""bigot"" is simply a snarl word used to defame a legitimate, adaptive evolutionary response. A Dork Enlightenment believer doesn't care if you're bigoted; they'd say the whole concept of ""bigotry"" is an inversion of the natural moral order in which the strong properly dominate the weak.  No, it's the particular kind of nerd-bro reactionary you see on KiA who needs to show that the ""SJWs"" are bigots. Someone who is deeply invested in a sense of themself as a victim of society (read: bullied in grade school) who nonetheless gritted their teeth and pulled through and made it in the world by virtue of their resilience and intellectual agility (read: now keeps a job and leads their WoW clan.) If the ""SJW""s are even partially right, then their whole self-conception is off; it's not that they haven't faced challenges and adapted, but, their life story isn't as compelling or impressive as they want it to be. Maybe even some of the ways they ""pulled through and made it in the world"" actually involved exploiting unearned privileges over others. This guy explains it in a lot more detail in his ongoing YouTube series ""Why Are You So Angry?"".  Basically the appeal of ""SJWs are bigots"" is that these guys need some explanation, any explanation, for why the SJWs can't possibly have a point, even partially; why they can't be taken seriously at all ever. It doesn't really matter what the particular explanation is. SJWs can be hateful bigots; members of a brainwashed cult; cynical con-men; the important point is that they're not just wrong, they're not even legitimate participants in the discussion.  TL;DR GamerGaters tell all kinds of insane stories about SJWs because their whole self-conception is threatened if ""SJWs"" are even worth listening to, let alone correct."
BestOfOutrageCulture,3dcvh6,EvanHarper,3,Wed Jul 15 20:26:55 2015 UTC,"You make a lot of very good points, and I think you're right when it comes to reactionaries who place themselves in opposition to SJWs specifically, and possibly to contemporary reactionaries in general. I feel like I've heard the ""liberals are the real bigots"" thing going around for a long time, though, so was thinking more about where it might have originated 10-20 years ago. Maybe today it's a phrase the ""nerd-bro reactionaries"" (love that phrase, btw) have picked up and employed because it fits in with their need to feel victimized? (Or maybe I'm just totally misremembering the longevity of the phrase, which is very possible.)"
BestOfOutrageCulture,3dcvh6,mattwan,3,Wed Jul 15 20:48:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah ""liberals are the real bigots"" is a thing but, remember, the GamerGaters are not coming out of conservative politics, if anything they associate it with superstitious evangelicals, big business, and moral scolds. They are more like Reagan Democrats, they have all kinds of inchoate quasi-left-wing views, it just takes a back seat to their conviction that they're under siege by cultural élites and there's no difference between the two parties on economic issues anyway."
BestOfOutrageCulture,3dcvh6,EvanHarper,4,Wed Jul 15 20:53:12 2015 UTC,"While I agree that GG isn't coming out of conservative politics, I think it's reasonable to say that their embracing of Christina Hoff Sommers et al. leaves them open to some conservative folkways. The comparison to Reagan Democrats is very good, but I think more of the inchoate group of angry white men who embraced the movie ""Falling Down"" unironically in the early/mid 90s--they ended up embracing cultural (and some aspects of economic) conservatism while rejecting the religious aspects and many of the cultural signifiers of ""conservative"".  Ultimately, though, I think we're just disagreeing over provenance, and maybe not totally disagreeing on that. :)  EDIT: While I'd bet the typical GamerGater would speak out against corporate influence on government, corporate tax breaks, and would possibly be in favor of universal healthcare, I wonder what he thinks of expanding welfare benefits? Would he answer differently if you called it ""expanding the social safety net"" instead of ""welfare and food stamps""?"

So let's talk about trivializing ISIS a bit... because that's exactly what GG is doing lately.   You may be wondering what ""the blocklist finding"" is. Mark ""blocklists are illegal"" ""Patron Saint of buses"" Kern claims that the ISIS twitter account blocks gators using one of the gator block lists. So he reported it to the FBI. Which naturally leads to discussing how gator blocklists are treason because they support America's enemies.  Yeah, there have been shitty jokes about ""even ISIS blocks gators,"" and ""ISIS is honest and self-aware about who they hate unlike gators."" Those are shit. What trivializes ISIS even more though is saying that gator blocklists are literally treason, literally terrorism, literally ISIS, actual FBI material. Then there is this KiA submission saying non-gators must support ISIS's goals and activities.   ""ISIS is more honest than gators"" is stupid, unfunny, unfair rhetoric.

We don't let everyone vote in elections for a good reason: we know that retards are the majority of people. You want Bill Gate's educated vote negated by some homeless retard on the street? That's EXACTLY what democratic voting does. That's exactly what the movie Idiocracy was about. When you give everyone an equal say, you negate the point of education. You negate the point of rational argumentation.    Naturally, this dude is enlightened by his own superior intellect and will definitely be allowed to vote and be active in politics. It's just those minorities, women and poor people uneducated, irrational cretins who won't be permitted to vote, not top minds like him.    It always amuses me when presumably young, not-wealthy, not-politically connected people propose restrictions on voting or reproduction and just assume they won't be among the restricted. Psst, internet slacktivism does not give you influence or power. You have no great wealth, you have no connections to powerful people, you are not from a notable old aristocratic family, you are not a leader in your community - you're going to be restricted too."

Looking at some statistics, it seems like Stormfront has just over 300,000 members but a significant number of them will be spammers, bots, banned members and inactive users. It's probably more accurate to look at their ""currently online"" numbers, which is around 900 at the moment. Coontown, on the other hand, has nearly 20,000 subscribers and around 200 people currently online.   Even if we assume that Coontown was the only racist subreddit on Reddit, we'd end up with a claim that is wrong but not at all outrageously wrong. They're roughly in the same ballpark for someone working from estimates rather than looking at the figures. This is especially true when we're looking at it in terms of growth, given that Stormfront has taken 25 years to get to 900 currently online members whereas Coontown has reached 200 currently online in around 7 months.  But more importantly, the qualifier of assuming Coontown is the only racist subreddit is obviously and undeniably wrong. I mean, /r/videos has 8 million subscribers and that's probably one of the largest racist subreddits around..."
