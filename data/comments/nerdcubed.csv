nerdcubed,3dzag2,ghostraded,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:02 2015 UTC,"Strategy does play an important roll, even if it is to a lesser degree. Four highly skilled players with no strategy will nearly always lose to four fairly skilled players with a highly refined strategy.  The game requires timing more so than twitch reactions thereby waiting for the perfect moment to make your move over taking every single shot."
nerdcubed,3dzag2,Alpha_Squad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:20 2015 UTC,"I really don't think that's true.  That argument can be made for FPS games but considering that this game works off of video game physics, there's not really a long term strategy you can make.  There's no real way to predict, before the match even starts, where that ball is going to go, simply because there will be 4 extra players batting it around.  It's not like a, you know, strategy game, where you can actually plan out where your troops will move and predict what your opponents will do.  I think you're confusing good teamwork with having a strategy."
nerdcubed,3dzag2,Revanaught,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:54:39 2015 UTC,"You consistently get good teamwork by having a strategy. Without strategy everyone just blindly chases the ball, with strategy people play actual (albeit dynamic) positions.  You can have strategies of what to do when the ball goes to specific areas even before the match starts."
nerdcubed,3dzag2,Alpha_Squad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:10:29 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but that's still not really the same as something like a strategy game.  This game is objectively more skill based than strategy based."
nerdcubed,3dzag2,Revanaught,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:22:59 2015 UTC,"I see you watched game theory. You might want to keep in mind that when it comes to video games there was not really anything to back it up. For real life cases, sure. But there was no evidence to suggest that it's the case for video games, or even that being aggressive in video games will give you an advantage over being defensive when the goal is not to reach a certain amount of kills first (Because the best players in a team need to make up for the worst players in the team when a certain amount of kills have to be reached)."
nerdcubed,3dzag2,bbruinenberg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:00:17 2015 UTC,"MatPat listed a ton of evidence for videos games in that very video.  Something along the lines of 70% of competative FPS games (games where skill is more needed) were won by red team, and 60% of competative LoL games were won by blue team (where strategy is more needed).  And Hell, even Dan's videos are supporting it.  This is a very skill based game, and on a player vs. player basis, blue team keeps losing.  When it was just them vs. the AI, well, it's not really as relevant since only one team was being affected the colors (and, frankly, Dan and Martyn are so bad it was effectively a 4 vs 2 match between the AI)"

You want to be an aggressive color, like red or orange, not a calm color like blue.  Also, we may have found out what   Careful that is not selection bias. Those with the skill get better options in choosing colours/preferences. Many games allow team swaps. Many games allow redos (people quit/reset the server if not the colour they want etc)."
nerdcubed,3dzag2,TechyBen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:49 2015 UTC,"I watched the video. Unlike you I also read the reddit posts and the comments that disputed his evidence. Fps games are most often played on a first to reach a certain amount of kills basis or on a first to reach a certain amount of points by owning keypoints basis. In those cases it's true that being aggressive helps. Those are also 2 of the only cases I can think of in competitive play where being aggressive helps more than being either tactical or defensive.  His LoL example was completely meaningless because of his complete lack of understanding of how the spectator mode works. The colours shown in spectator mode are not the same as the colours seen when playing. The map is also asymmetrical, giving 1 team a clear advantage from the very start over the other team (an advantage that is a lot bigger than any possible advantage that colour can give you)."

He also tweeted that he thinks the old PC will be good enough for console stuff so that's also a couple more videos.    Of course I don't know what Dan is going to do. And personally I wouldn't blame him for taking this as a opportunity to rest a bit. But in a perfect world for us that would just mean that for at least a month the Cities series and GTA:V Mods series will be gone. The rest of the series could all still be done on console. With minimum editing. (Cough* Far cry 4 permadeath). This might also result in an explosion on the IRL channel. As that theoretically could be done on a phone.

You could talk about anything like if you've played it since then, thoughts in hindsight, make funny remarks on your video and how your style of presenting has changed, things like that.  Yeah, it would be a bit meta, but it's a neat little idea that would be easy to pull off and when your new rig is done you can put the retrospects into it's own playlist and not bother with them again...until the next time ;)"

nerdcubed,3e0lrd,DoctorEdward,10,Tue Jul 21 01:09:57 2015 UTC,"There are 3 things wrong with this:   Dan lies.  A lot.  He makes stuff like this up just to fuck with the audience.  You can usually tell when he's making something up when he says ""true story"" or ""that's true"" or ""true science fact"".  Those are usually good indicators that whatever he just said is, in fact, not true.   First Impressions is a very different idea from Fucks With.  First Impressions implies informal review, and of course that it's the first impression.  Fucks With is just having fun with a game, and of course doesn't have to be the first time Dan's played it. I and W are nowhere near each other on the keyboard.  If you're typing in the way you're supposed to, they're not even pressed by the same hand.  Even if you got your hands mixed up, those keys aren't even hit by the same finger, W being hit by the ring finger, and I being hit by the middle finger.  If he'd gotten his hands mixed up, Dan would have hit E, not W.  If you're pecking, then you're also looking at the keyboard to know what you're hitting.

nerdcubed,3dywfg,NateShaw92,2,Mon Jul 20 19:29:42 2015 UTC,Don't know. He only said stuff about PS2 and PS3. He's having to use the server bit of his computer to do everything on now. The server bit only has an onboard intergrated graphics thing so it is probably only able to play/use PS2 or PS3 stuff.  Still don't know though. Only going off what he said.
nerdcubed,3dywfg,Pepsiisgood1997,3,Mon Jul 20 20:23:52 2015 UTC,PS2 month? This is awesome!
nerdcubed,3dywfg,Dammasta28,5,Mon Jul 20 17:43:53 2015 UTC,I'm praying with all my tiny heart that he plays Burnout 3
nerdcubed,3dywfg,Randomsmurf13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:42 2015 UTC,"I too pray with my feeble heart. He mentioned in a Knee Jerk how it was 'the greatest racer of all time', so my hopes and hype is high."
nerdcubed,3dywfg,scottishdrunkard,2,Mon Jul 20 20:29:57 2015 UTC,I know right? I hope he does a video on Metal Gear Solid 3.
nerdcubed,3dywfg,HamShanky,2,Mon Jul 20 17:46:39 2015 UTC,You know where to go then. To the Requests Megathread!  batman scene flashcard thing
nerdcubed,3dxrxa,UndeadDragon,2,Mon Jul 20 12:18:15 2015 UTC,Based on the description he liked it...
nerdcubed,3dxrxa,johnald42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:52 2015 UTC,Well he finally got his sports tractor in farm machine championships
nerdcubed,3e0aii,SomeRandomGamer3,18,Mon Jul 20 23:38:06 2015 UTC,True love
nerdcubed,3e0aii,Carrotspy007,11,Mon Jul 20 23:46:40 2015 UTC,According to Dan in that same stream: I lie to you about the basic details of myself.
nerdcubed,3e0aii,Joshua9182998,2,Tue Jul 21 02:52:50 2015 UTC,"Like his name, his age, and judging by the fact he said stuff like ""My house here in the UK"" there's the rumour still going that Dan didn't move country."
nerdcubed,3e0aii,RandomLiam,2,Tue Jul 21 10:34:56 2015 UTC,"He probably did. I remember seeing a question from someone who sighted him, but didn't say where. Rumors have also been going around that he lives in an island south of the UK and north of France with fast Internet. Nothing confirmed, though."
nerdcubed,3e0aii,Sinius,2,Tue Jul 21 11:41:33 2015 UTC,The whole age thing is probably just a throw off. Unless he really played the long game and since the early vlogs has lied about his age we can still assume he is somewhere in the vicinity of 26.
nerdcubed,3e0aii,Stargazeer,3,Tue Jul 21 11:54:51 2015 UTC,"I just stay out of it either way. He doesn't have a ring, but he's called her his 'Missus' since he made the post about his laptop frying itself on tumblr."
nerdcubed,3e0aii,RachelWolfeFem,4,Tue Jul 21 05:58:08 2015 UTC,"tumblr   Fuck me, that was ages ago!"
nerdcubed,3e0aii,scottishdrunkard,2,Tue Jul 21 08:41:57 2015 UTC,"You beat me to posting this. Hi from the twitch stream. No idea if he is married (genuinely) or not, but he has mentioned his ""Missus"" in a video before.   Still, I never knew he was married. Matt, can you confirm? (If you're here)..."
nerdcubed,3e0aii,RandomLiam,11,Mon Jul 20 23:39:42 2015 UTC,Omg im dying because I said is Dan a virgin and he said no im with vodafone.
nerdcubed,3e0aii,RandomLiam,3,Mon Jul 20 23:44:07 2015 UTC,That was you who asked? I couldn't stop laughing either... so quick...
nerdcubed,3e0aii,eanfran,3,Mon Jul 20 23:44:59 2015 UTC,Oh no no matt is choking. :D
nerdcubed,3e0aii,RandomLiam,3,Mon Jul 20 23:47:27 2015 UTC,Ahhaha 2 guys 1 stream.
nerdcubed,3e0aii,IForgetMyself,2,Mon Jul 20 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"Sort of relevant, what was the stream on?  I am assuming GTA or rocket league, so just say latter or former I guess."
nerdcubed,3e0aii,the32bits,2,Mon Jul 20 23:41:45 2015 UTC,"They were waiting to join WWE 2K15... then Dan started reading twitch comments and turns out he's married, unless he was joking. No one knows for sure. Also, apparently Dan's not his real name."
nerdcubed,3e0aii,RandomLiam,6,Mon Jul 20 23:44:04 2015 UTC,"Well, you can look up the Director(s) of UK Companies, If you look up Nerd Cubed Limited, it shows a Mr. Steven & Daniel Hardcastle as directors (and Wot & Tracy). Case closed."
nerdcubed,3e0aii,eggshitter,4,Tue Jul 21 11:40:24 2015 UTC,I do believe his name is actually Daniel.
nerdcubed,3e0aii,bob_condor,3,Mon Jul 20 23:54:46 2015 UTC,"It's been going around for about 2 years, that Dan Hardcastle might not be his real name."
nerdcubed,3e0aii,Professor_Hoover,5,Tue Jul 21 00:02:58 2015 UTC,"I kind of have to disagree. He wouldn't have planned a fake name from the start, would he? Where does he first say his name?"
nerdcubed,3e0aii,AndyRedditor,2,Tue Jul 21 00:11:28 2015 UTC,"I've used dozens of fake names online and I don't create anything, I wouldn't be surprised if Dan used fake names whenever he started branding his work."
nerdcubed,3e0aii,DinoDoesStuff,4,Tue Jul 21 08:31:52 2015 UTC,"I think Daniel and Steve Hardcastle are their real names. They refer to themselves by their fake names way too often, and the way Steve does it I find it hard to believe he's using a fake name."
nerdcubed,3e0aii,Rouninscholar,2,Tue Jul 21 11:18:21 2015 UTC,Daniel Hardcastle.
