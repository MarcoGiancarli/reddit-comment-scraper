woodworking,3e337w,727Super27,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:23 2015 UTC,"Oh right. I had it indoors for about 3 months but it has been decently humid, so it might be a little wet. I also let it sit in the sun on a few dry days all day. There is a few cracks on the surface that started to form from the drying, but the varathane filled them pretty decently"

woodworking,3e337w,michUP33,3,Tue Jul 21 17:36:39 2015 UTC,"Well... if it's sealed, it will slow the drying process, possibly enough to avoid catastrophic checking and cracking.  If you want to pull out the stops you could strip off the sealer/finish and soak the wood in polyethylene glycol-1000 (http://www.woodweb.com/knowledge_base/Using_PEG_for_dimensional_stability.html). You can get this on Amazon or even go to Walmart and buy Miralax (though I think that might be more expensive). Alternatively, you could just let it happen and then chisel in some nice bowtie keys across the check (assuming they aren't horrendously wide)."

woodworking,3dzyvv,DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,30,Tue Jul 21 01:04:19 2015 UTC,"I would advise no contrasting colors. You already have an accent with the metal color.

woodworking,3dzyvv,DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:56:27 2015 UTC,"That would look cool and could be a really unique detail, it just completely changes the design ""point"" of the bench.   Right now the bench is simple, natural wood edge nicely contrasting with the industrial I beam. The absence of wood in the notch highlights the shape of the beam and is a interesting modern take on a simple straight forward bench. It also highlights the thin profile of the beam lending an unexpected delicateness to what is a rugged material.   Filling in that cavity with striped wood completely changes that. It pulls focus from the I beam and draws your attention to the colorful stripes. It takes focus away from the natural edge wood plank as well. It also makes the leg much chunkier.   Filled in that leg is significantly wider than the top which changes the proportions of the thickness of leg to top ratios, making it bottom heavy.   It could look really awesome, but it will take over the piece and turn it into a bench with a funky thick unique striped leg not ""modern organic"".  The beam with be superfluous as that point.  The detail of the natural edge, the contrast of wood against metal, industrial versus organic, will be outshined by colorful contrasting wood. Again, this isn't necessarily bad, it just shouldn't be done as a last minute whim. Design should be done with intention.   Sorry for the long rant, it's something I'm kind of passionate about."

As bad as that looks, if you broke up the concrete, the steel underground would be fine.

Large systems are in place in bridges, roads, underground pipelines to basically run electricity through rebar/steel to reverse the naturally-occuring corrosion cell that occurs between steel and concrete. Look up ""cathodic protection"" on wikipedia to learn more but basically when you put Steel in concrete, the steel automatically becomes an anode (think negative terminal on a battery) while the concrete or soil is the cathode. The natural reaction is for ions to leave the anode (in the process corroding the material) and migrate to the cathode. You need to pump electricity through the steel/concrete to force the reaction into reverse.

(These steel shapes are all ""hot rolled"" - a bar of hot steel is run through a set of rollers to form the final shape).  ""W"" shapes are ""wide flange"" - a different system of rollers is used to create even thickness flanges, which is a bit more efficient, and makes fabrication - particularly bolted connections - easier, and thus less expensive in final construction.

It's not the end grain that's the issue really after wood has had a chance to season thoroughly.

I can see huge cracks appearing along the length of the slab in the future, as the I-beam will stop the outside sections moving when the wood contracts.   Not to mention that if the slab twists even a little bit over the seasons, having only one edge (or even one corner) of the I-beam on the floor is going to cause all sorts of problems; both with the floor getting marked, and the whole thing rocking when someone sits on it."

You're going to regret this massively at least a few times before you learn your lesson and stop walking around in the dark. Always have a light on so you don't rip your toes off.  Next up, ensure you clean up that steel really well. Most of the stuff that's easy to find has quite a bit of oil leftover on it from the manufacturing process. I use white fuel and some wd-40 to get most of it off. If you don't get it all of you'll find it on your floors or on yourself and your clothes for months.  Also, seriously plan on putting some rubber feet on these, unless you will have them on carpet (or a rug). I just buy whatever seems like it will work at Lowe's and stick it on there. I keep extras on hand because they don't always stay stuck as well as I would hope. If you're renting remember it will leave pretty serious dents on carpet, and even more serious dents on vinyl flooring. Laminate is okay, but it will scratch easily if you're not super careful. Wood will gouge if you're not careful. When in doubt, pick it up to move it.  Next up is going to be the rust issue. If don't seal the steel it will rust. If you do seal it, it will probably still rust in some places. So if you spill something on it, get it dried off. Don't put it back on shampooed carpets until they're 100% dry.  Also remember, things like this are guaranteed not to be child-proof. I like that aspect, it keeps people from thinking my house is a daycare, but keep that in mind.  When you vacuum around the legs be careful, that steel is a lot harder than your vacuum is.  Now, all of that said, steel/wood furniture is my favorite by a long shot. It looks fantastic, and having metal legs means it will outlast yourself and still look brand new. I highly suggest it for people willing to deal with some of the pitfalls."

If you're unsure about if it's one size or another get the next size up and use a fine grit sandpaper to remove the material until it fits. If you want a flush mount stem, you would also remove material on the outside until it fits you pipe ;you could gently fit the tip of the stem into the chuck of a hand drill and sand it while it spins for a crappy lathe). Then use progressively higher grits to remove and sanding marks and polish with buffing compound  (a rotary tool helps with this and many pipe making tasks). Pipe stems come straight but can be heated and bent as desired.  Usually one would sand the pipe and stem together to get them to be a perfect match and then polish both, but you might not want to get into that for this project.   Good luck!"

woodworking,3e26ns,fergiz01,2,Tue Jul 21 11:31:15 2015 UTC,Where did you learn to do the restore? I bought 3 panel saws and planned on watching Paul Sellers video this weekend and making an attempt at my first restoration
woodworking,3e26ns,thahamer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:37:16 2015 UTC,"There's the Paul Sellers video and a whole bunch of others on YouTube. It's up to you how new you want the saw to look, although it'll never look brand new, especially if the blade is pitted. Paul Sellers is all about getting the saw functional and looking well loved, while preserving the patina of its past experiences. I buy into this philosophy, but probably want mine looking a bit newer than he makes his look."

woodworking,3e26ns,Graphus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:26 2015 UTC,"Awesome, you did end up getting all of them!  Like /u/fergiz01 says, you don't need to do much to these saws.  In fact, you don't NEED to do anything to them, besides sharpen. The handles aren't cracked, the plates aren't rusted, and the etches are still good. So better to leave well enough alone.  All you need to do is sharpen. You can practice on the junky looking one with no plate left if you don't want to touch the nice ones. Get a slim taper and bastard file from Amazon, some 1x1s, and two wooden clamps if you don't have a vice. pinch the saw between the 1x1s, then stick em in the clamps, standing up. Congratulations, you have a saw vice!  To start with, run the bastard file across the top of the teeth until you see shiny points on all the teeth. Then practice filing rip teeth: drop the slim taper into the teeth. Keep it perpendicular to the plate, and let it follow whatever angles the teeth have already. Lightly push the file through until the tooth you're filing has a point at the top - 3 or 4 strokes.  You now have a working saw!"
woodworking,3e26ns,ydbd1969,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:54 2015 UTC,"The handle and brass came up beautifully!  The pits on the blade don't matter much, as long as they don't interfere with the cutting edges of the teeth they won't affect performance much or at all. Particularly not if you keep it well waxed.  You have of course removed most or all of the set of the teeth so I'd expect this won't cut that well until the saw is resharpened."
woodworking,3e26ns,BeerBaconBoobies,2,Tue Jul 21 15:26:19 2015 UTC,"This is the saw I posted about earlier in the week. I chose to give it a vinegar bath in the end as there was so much rust and other crap on the blade, which came off nicely. I gave the blade a light sand to 400 grit, but it's really badly pitted. If it doesn't cut nicely after a sharpen and set, I'll consider replacing the blade with a much newer Disston blade I have lying around.  The handle, brass back and split nuts came up beautifully though! Thanks to everyone who gave me advice earlier in the week. This is the fifth saw restoration I've done and think I'm addicted."

woodworking,3e3g0p,TJnova,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:22 2015 UTC,"Use s4s (already squared up and flat, stands for straight or square four sides) wood for your first few projects. It'll still be not perfect, but a he'll of a lot better than construction lumber. You will probably be buying your wood at a big box store, which means oak/poplar/maple/pine, none of which are exceptionally weather resistant, so use an outdoor finish like marine spar varnish. Try poplar, it's pretty easy to work with, only thing that sucks about it is that it blotches pretty bad when stained dark unless you are really careful.   Also, no matter how frustrated you are, or how shitty you think it is, complete the project. Other people won't notice the flaws like you do. I abandoned my first several projects before applying a finish, so I got decent at building nice shit but my finishing skills still lag behind.   Buy a combination square, it's useful for a million things when making a box. And get either corner clamps (they clamp on 2 perpendicular sides at exactly 90 deg), or get a small try square that you can clamp into your box when gluing to ensure it stays square. It's possible, but really hard to make the lid and everything fit nice if your box isn't perfectly square."
woodworking,3e36uj,K00PER,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:26 2015 UTC,"Like with the planes, there are always other brands to consider, but for saws Disston is the default answer. The problem is that there's this huge array of old saws out there, even from the sweet era of Disstons, that are perfectly serviceable and cut fine once you set them up. They're also cheaper. This is particularly true for panel saws. The reason is pretty simple -- unlike a plane, where you're getting into quality of the body and a variety of features, a saw is just a big, flat piece of metal. There's not really features to think about. At worst you could start considering the handle or quality of the steel. But, unless that thing was made out of soft lead, it's probably going to be able to cut wood.  For chisels, the Stanley Sweetheart 750's are considered really desirable. (They even went through this popularity burst a few years ago that drove up their prices, and Stanley did a reissue on them.) But I've got this huge array of chisels sitting on my bench, and I'm just as likely to reach for one of my through tanged, metal bashers as I am for my Stanley's. I'm in the camp that you don't need a special, expensive, or old chisel.  Other tools? Apart from some utter junk, the vast majority of screwdrivers, braces, and hand drills are a dime a dozen. Braces can be finicky and the mechanical stuff in them worn out (if you get a ratcheting one), so just mess around with them a bit to see if they've got any play. But I've knocked rust off of quite a few ratcheting ones, and the vast majority of them have held up over the years.  Major exception to this: push drills. Push drills are super fun, and I think the bits are really cool. If you're doing smaller scale stuff they're invaluable. But I have yet to pick up an old push drill that wasn't somehow mechanically messed up or sticky. If you're dying to have a push drill, I'd buy a new one from Garrett Wade."
woodworking,3e36uj,screwikea,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:13 2015 UTC,"I solely use hand tools that I have found and restored (minus my current chisels, which are some old Japanese chisels I purchased on eBay and don't know what brand they are).     Here’s some things I look for at antique stores, flea markets, garage sales, estate sales, etc.     Hand Planes: Sargent, Record, Millers, Clifton, and if you can find them Norris of London or Spiers of Scotland for smoothing planes.  Doubt you'll find the last two anywhere but online (unless you are in the UK).     Saws - There are literally dozens upon dozens of saws you can look for.  Rule of thumb for me is pre-1940 is a buy if it's in good enough shape to restore and flip locally.  To get you just a basic, you can find a lot of Disstons and they are really good quality (again, pre-war).  For Disstons you want No7, 12, 16, 112, D8, D100 or smaller saws like the No12 cross cut, No4 Tenon, or the smaller 8""-10"" dovetail saws.     Those saws are very easy to restore (provided no pitting, decent teeth, and no huge problems with the handle).  I find those Disston saws to be the easiest to find and can be purchased at flea markets, garage sales and estate sales for normally less than $5 and can be sold for a lot more when fixed up online.     Chisels are kind of like saws, but even less picky.  There's really not a lot to them.  As long as there is no huge damage to the chisel (excluding the handle, which you can turn a new one) then nearly any chisel out there will do.  If you are looking for yourself or for resell, then specifically Japanese chisels or maybe some Stanley 750s.  Everyone has their own preferred chisels and as long as you can get them flat and sharp, you're good to go and brand doesn't matter."

Many museums store things in wooden boxes- not usually in direct contact with the wood but in wooden boxes. Paper goods are often stored with acid free cotton rag liners. Here are guidelines for storing works on paper:   A cool (room temperature or below), relatively dry (about 35% relative humidity), clean, and stable environment (avoid attics, basements, and other locations with high risk of leaks and environmental extremes)  Minimal exposure to all kinds of light; no exposure to direct or intense light  Distance from radiators and vents  Supportive protective enclosures*  Unfolded and flat or rolled storage for oversized papers  Individual/isolated storage of acidic papers to prevent acids from migrating into the other works on paper   Supportive protective enclosures include: acid- and lignin-free folders, mats, and document boxes (all available alkaline buffered or neutral pH); and polyester film sleeves that are stiff enough to adequately support the paper(s) within. Alkaline buffered storage materials provide a desirable neutralizing effect on acids that are inherent in works on paper, especially as paper ages, but be aware that some media found on paper objects may be sensitive to alkaline pH. Polyester film has the benefit of being clear, but does not contain an alkaline buffer and with little friction readily produces an electrostatic charge that can lift powdery media such as pastel, charcoal, pencil, and flaking paint."

woodworking,3dxosl,diito,3,Mon Jul 20 13:59:22 2015 UTC,"How exactly is the maple top attached to the base?    If you can get it off easily it would be pretty easy to just make a new top. Maple, either hard or soft, is pretty cheap and you don't need very much. That will be a lot easier than trying to re-use what you have and match the color etc.  When you do it you'll want to avoid any cross grain construction.  Flat/plain sawn lumber moves primarily tangentially (across the width).  Unless you live in a desert somewhere that has consistent low humidity year round you will need to allow for wood movement.  The way you built this now the top will want to expand/contract across it's width while the cross grain ends of your frame will not do that.  If you've attached the top incorrectly too, as I suspect you did (not allowing for movement) that's a big issue too.  I can't say exactly what will move likely happen but it could be anything from cracking to the mitered corners opening up.  I'd just drop the frame.  Attach the top using cleats that have room to expand/contract everywhere except the center of the two ends of the top.  The center you want fixed so that any expansion/contraction is all evenly distributed on each side.

Now that you know that - and if those prospects excite you - go for it!  Your ""rectangle sander"" is called a sheet sander.  Specifically it's a half-sheet sander (because it takes a half sheet).  The little squarish palm sanders are called quarter-sheet sanders.  It's perfectly fine to cut your own from full sheets - and cheaper too.  A belt sander uses sanding belts.

You can find it online or at most hobby stores.  Watch some videos and learn a few basics of carving first.  No matter what wood your first table will be, it will be much harder to carve than basswood.  You will likely want some carving chisels you can use a mallet with.  Flexcut makes these too.

If you're really a beginner, I don't want to discourage you & my opinion is just one of many, but there is a lot of techniques/skills involved with all of those tasks. Resurfacing/finishing takes a little while to get used to. Carving onto wood is no easy feat (I'd imagine). Personally I never got into wood carving but I have studied sculpture in undergrad and can tell you that its a different way of thinking and working than traditional art. You'd also need various tools to do the job effectively. For resurfacing: at the least you'll need a sander & sand paper. For finishing, you'll need some type of stain + protective coat. Carving...idk much about the specific tools you'll need but I don't think they're cheap. Plus, you'll need a way to sharpen those tools. I'm not saying it cannot be done. But perhaps its best if you practice first? Practice on scrap wood and do a carving study. Learn to do sanding and finishing. And then move on to the actual table.   Just my 2cents. I hope I wasn't offensive in any way."

woodworking,3e2mgi,APinchOfMurder,2,Tue Jul 21 14:11:00 2015 UTC,"Depending on what other tools you have, adding a jointer should do more for you  than upgrading a plane you already have.  Of course, If you've got an actual jointer in your shop this doesn't really apply."

woodworking,3dwb2u,thefreemind,14,Tue Jul 21 00:22:58 2015 UTC,Howed you hide the wire?
woodworking,3dwb2u,Tomass5000,17,Mon Jul 20 02:21:52 2015 UTC,"The arm is a laminate structure, so I left a channel open in the middle laminates to allow for the wire to sit.  It was a major pain in the ass clamping that up and making sure the channel remained in there."
woodworking,3dwb2u,LickitySplit939,13,Mon Jul 20 02:29:33 2015 UTC,Why didn't you include the wire as a part of the laminate stack when bending (or is that what you did?)
woodworking,3dwb2u,jd3p0,9,Mon Jul 20 04:35:38 2015 UTC,"If he didn't, the advantage would be the ability to rewire. But then again OP's work looks much better than mine and I'd guess he needs Rewire things much less than I do."
woodworking,3dwb2u,Sol_Invictus,45,Mon Jul 20 11:17:34 2015 UTC,"Hey there... I was just on my way out for the night when I saw this.  Beautiful work.  If it were mine, I might have positioned the light/shade a little higher ~ in the 1/3rd - 2/3rds area. When you center something like that, it tends to give a very static, immobile, heavy kind of feel to things. It's not my impression from the rest of the piece that that's what you were looking for. --- I think I'd also have gone to the trouble to make the 'rod' (holding the light and carrying the wire down to the lamp) out of wood. That seems like it might be more in fitting with your bent-wood work. ...But those are minor quibbles. You did the work so you get to pick : )  The one choice you made that I think was just a bad idea is the location of (what I think is) the on/off switch .... down on the base, centered just under the light?  That position gives a terribly strong prominence to ....the light switch ???  Bury that sucker back on the back side of the stand... and put something beautiful in that place. A little bit of inlay or marquetry... your initials... the dog's picture, but not the switch lol  'Course it's always easier to bitch than to do some work... Really nice job."
woodworking,3dwb2u,gbaybay,23,Mon Jul 20 02:13:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comment and the feedback.  I'll keep some of this in mind when I take another crack at re-making this design.
woodworking,3dwb2u,VolatileBeans,25,Mon Jul 20 02:28:40 2015 UTC,"I like the position of the light switch.  It's really an elegant mechanism.   Its position reinforces the simplicity and utility of a lamp.  If you hide the switch, people won't realize the effort you invested to hide the wire within the laminate - a beautiful move in my opinion.  They may assume the switch is on the socket and not the base."
woodworking,3dwb2u,Sol_Invictus,7,Mon Jul 20 06:37:57 2015 UTC,I can agree with you here but I think if he keeps the position of the switch the same he should go with a different style of switch. The switch currently used does not fit with the style of the piece. A rocker switch or push button would look a whole lot better imo
woodworking,3dwb2u,gbaybay,4,Mon Jul 20 14:27:00 2015 UTC,"I don't completely disagree with this and spent some time looking at and considering the chosen switch placement. It's a judgement call. One that will be based on our sense of aesthetics because, of course, any placement will 'work'.  There's something in the lamp that just doesn't quite work for me and I can't positively identify what it is. To me, visually taking that switch away from the focus of attention helped smooth out whatever my problem with the design is."
woodworking,3dwb2u,scherlock79,6,Mon Jul 20 08:21:39 2015 UTC,Perhaps it is the lamp shade that isn't quite working.  I'd maybe look into a shade that is somewhat spherical rather than rectangular from the side view.  It may complement the laminated wood that is already curved.  Ikea has some sweet and super cheap shades. Joxtorp another one
woodworking,3dwb2u,Sol_Invictus,7,Mon Jul 20 08:38:30 2015 UTC,My immediate impression was that the lampshade was out of place.  A spherical one would look fantastic.
woodworking,3dwb2u,scherlock79,2,Mon Jul 20 11:41:11 2015 UTC,"Yep. I looked at that too.  I may have looked at the shade first and ended up focusing on it's position vertically... It wasn't the whole of the problem, but as 'first commentor' I didn't want to seem like I was just bagging on the end result, cause I'm not.  The tweaks that need to be made, I think, are subtle --- or at least to me they are. I'd have to live with this for a while... set it up and a table and walk past it everyday, before I'd be sure what to do."

woodworking,3dwb2u,tpodr,5,Mon Jul 20 02:28:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah; there's a rule of thirds. But hard and fast rules never work if blindly applied. There's too many variables that may make a piece need to move a skosh one way or the other. Even dead-on centering can work in some instances... as always, 'It depends'.  There's a recent and excellent book out that will lead you in the direction of applying this stuff. It's titled ""By Hand and Eye"" from Lost Art Press. Google it.  In the end it's all about training your eye: getting experience looking at good designs and making your own. Rules only approximate. (Trained) Intuition places parts exactly."
woodworking,3dwb2u,Sol_Invictus,2,Mon Jul 20 12:25:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for the head's up on the book. Just ordered a copy. I've been searching for some good practical design books. Any more recommendations?
woodworking,3dwb2u,tpodr,2,Mon Jul 20 13:36:23 2015 UTC,"Hi.  I could go on and on about this but, without sounding like too much of a putz, design is really hard to learn from a book. You can learn sets of rules, but the fly-in-the-ointment is that exceptional design almost always evolves from breaking those rules in clever, stylish ways... As with everything else in life, if it's only a matter of following steps that can be clearly written down, any ""skill"" then becomes trivial 'cause anyone can do it.  I have a fairly good eye, but I can't always say WHAT the problem is or maybe not even find a way to fix it, but give me (visual) chaos and I can find beauty in it.  I didn't learn that from books on woodworking. I learned it through applying principles of design in other areas of interest and, over time, developing 'an eye' for dynamic and subtle balance (or, once you have that part, UN-balance).  I've been a professional photographer, a furniture builder, and studied a number of traditional Japanese arts. And, I still just look an awful lot.  I've found Pinterest to be a tremendous resource. They have an ""Explore"" function. When I'm interested in a subject now, I go and explore it on Pinterest. You can enter your own term, e.g. ""furniture design"" and in addition to what ever images are pulled from the database, you get recommendations for other search terms. You can see an awful lot of good design there very easily... and often also find links to ""how to"" information.  Different disciplines sometimes will have a well-known book which detail design within that discipline and I've found these always worth reading... although I have no list of suggested titles for you now. This is information gleaned over years and years of reading.  Sorry I can't be of more direct help."
woodworking,3dwb2u,SnickleTitts,2,Mon Jul 20 14:22:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughtful reply. So, pretty much continue what I'm doing. I too spend time just studying what I see around me. If something is appealing, I try to understand  why. Likewise, if something seems off, I get curious  and strive to isolate which aspect of the design is giving me that feeling. Rinse and repeat."

woodworking,3dwb2u,Sol_Invictus,4,Mon Jul 20 16:11:44 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your critiques. Looking at this as a design piece, it appears as though symmetry is the intent. The shade is centered in the symmetrical C and the switch mirrors the wire from the top."
woodworking,3dwb2u,Sol_Invictus,3,Mon Jul 20 14:31:27 2015 UTC,"Kool; different perspectives are what makes this interesting.  However, the success of symetry as a design intent (if it is) may be open to question.  I have no axe to grind either way. OP's the maker; the decisions are his.

woodworking,3dwb2u,bobskizzle,9,Mon Jul 20 10:28:27 2015 UTC,"It's standard bent lamination. Make a mold mirroring the inverted contour. Rip 1/8th strips of a softwood (birch and pine are fairly popular) of your choosing along the grain. Steam soften to increase bendy-factor. Face to face glue all of your layers with Titebond II (other glues will work but Titebond II is fantastic). Clamp tightly to the mold. Like, overclamp. You can't have too many clamps. Wait 12 hours.

I think part of the problem was I didn't know what it was called so didn't know what to search for. So how do you rip the wood into thin sheets? Can you do it on any bit of pine from a local diy store or does it gave to be special stuff from a saw mill?"
woodworking,3dwb2u,BooksofMagic,2,Mon Jul 20 13:33:33 2015 UTC,"This is just standard pine from a local lumber yard.  I used my (very standard) 10"" table saw to rip the boards into thin strips.  The pain in the ass part was having to rip each board twice to make a single strip because my table saw doesn't to a height of cut 5.5"" inches (the width of the board).  It worked, but it required some clean up after each strip was ripped down (i.e. sanding to make the surface smooth).  Honestly, this project made me really want to get a planer - that would have made cleaning up each strip so much easier and less time consuming."

Looks like I swung and missed on the lamp shade - although that's the feedback I want to hear because I want to improve that aspect in future designs.  A little more info about the build:   The base is a cast of cement + sand I made the lamp shade from parts from this shop and fabric from a local shop. I did a natural stain with 4 coats of poly on the arm I have a support wire running next to the electrical wire down from the arm to the shade so the lamp wire isn't bearing all the weight from the shade (although the lamp shade is so light, I doubt it would matter). I didn't use any steam or heat - I simply ripped each strip down thin enough so that it would flex sufficiently.    This build really made me want to get a planer.  Having to rip down 5.5"" wide boards on a table saw was a pain because my maximum blade height wasn't over 5.5"" - so I had to do a lot of clean up (i.e. sanding) on the cuts after each strip was ripped down.  A planer would have simplified that big time.  Thanks for checking this out.  edit: If you're curious, here's a quick video of me switching the lamp OFF --> ON"

I used PVC in my last shop as well as metal duct hose, didn't think of static electricity.  A lot of shops use the flex tube like regular vacuum hoses, which develop static, never heard of a fire started that way..."

woodworking,3e2i4s,upshot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:43 2015 UTC,Overhead drops are more for getting the ducting out of the way than anything.  If your shop is big enough that you have machines not against a wall overhead drops get the ducting off of the floor so you're not tripping over it.
woodworking,3e2i4s,grantd86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:46 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't have enough machines that require a lot of space. The one that takes up the most is the table saw. I can run the ducting a few feet off the ground without it being in the way.
woodworking,3e2i4s,manga311,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:08:11 2015 UTC,From what i have seen.  People usually ground the pvc with a wire wrapped around the the pvc and attached to a pipe or something that is grounded.   I don't think the static could start a fire but if it picks up fine enough dust with the static it could build up and it could combust with varnish or other petroleum products...  Maybe
woodworking,3e2i4s,phb07jm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:39:58 2015 UTC,Grounding PVC in that way would be totally ineffective as the charge cannot travel freely within the PVC only the bit right next to the grounding contact would be earthed.

woodworking,3dxran,solo2070,2,Mon Jul 20 15:10:25 2015 UTC,"Got some flak over in DIY for this one- can be a tough crowd :) Here is some background that I failed to give originally over there that maybe clears up some confusion on why I would build something like this :p  The previous 2 owners just had 40ish inch TVs on stands in the corner (could see in previous real estate postings) and just looked awful- this is more of a sitting room and a boxy tv stand just looked out of place and completely blocked the window. (Of course you can argue this does too- but you'd have the see the room as a whole to appreciate it). Rather than try to somehow blend a TV into the space (no real wall area to mount it other than the fireplace)- I decided I might as well take a risk and go for something of a statement piece, but that still felt 'airy' and minimally blocked the window (at least is slatted to let the light through and a smaller TV -32inch. (65"" in the basement for primary TV viewing)  Then there is the fireplace- a really high mantel that a TV over it would not only be really high, but spoil the beautiful 1920s look of it- I wanted the focus of the room to still be that fireplace (I don't really have any shots of the whole room since we're still waiting on furniture. Mounting it above there was out of the question.  So this problem got me thinking a bit creatively with some inspiration for B&Os Beovision floor-standing TVs. The furniture in here will be very mid century modern-ish- so this look felt like it would play nicely.  Also- yes, the cables will all be hidden/relocated- just ran out of time last night :)"
woodworking,3dxran,ICanBeHandyToo,4,Mon Jul 20 12:14:50 2015 UTC,It looks really good! Did you consider adding shelving to the backside of the stand for a tv receiver? It could help lower the center of gravity in case you ever bump into it. The only thing that bothers me here is the dark oak furniture in what looks like a very bright living space.
woodworking,3dxran,Drewology,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:12:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I never really considered storage space for anything- this isn't the primary TV watching room so it is just a TV and a roku stick to keep it minimal.  The dark oak actually matched the mantle, coffee table, and end table- gives a nice contrast to the lighter floor and walls- but we're still waiting on the rest of our furniture so it's tough to get a feel for the space."
woodworking,3dxran,_Driftwood_,3,Mon Jul 20 14:55:13 2015 UTC,"Other than all the wires being exposed, looks like a nice, simple design.  I wouldn't feel comfortable with the TV just balancing like that, and would probably go with something like this.  Keep the same design you got going on, but where the TV will mount, make it a solid board maybe 4 or 5 slats thick, buck cut the sides so it still looks like slats.  This way it still looks the same (can't see behind the TV), but allows you to use the TVs VESA mount to secure the TV to a board.  I've been trying to think how to hide the cables and other than making a seperate stand next to the stand to house say a DVD player or cable box, you could make a tray that sits behind he TV that it all sits on.  So, in that case, maybe make the one board I was speaking about earlier a little bigger, say 9-10 slats and have two shelves hand behind the TV to place everything on. That would clear up all the cables and would just require you to run the power cord cable from the wall flush with the legs.  You tied those slats that hold the TV because you want it to be able to adjust the slats.  Do you mean tear this down and store it in a smaller footprint or what?  Not sure what adjustments would need to be made that doesn't allow you to glue the slats in place.  edit:  Looking again at everything, you could also use the slats as sort of a french cleats system.  Make some slats that have shelves that hang off the front below the TV and that's where you put the cable box or DVD player."
woodworking,3dxran,mesropa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:53:52 2015 UTC,"The tv is secured with big washers in the back so it's not just the nuts that the photos are showing- that was just for a quick test-fit. It could definitely be more solidly mounted, but I didn't want to add any thickness by using a VESA mount. The precarious part is that the slats are just held by pressure- so the ones that are holding the TV could get pulled out (no pets or kids yet at least!)- so I know I need to find a better solution than the twine (which is just a fail-safe at the moment). Could glue- but part of the appeal of this to me was that I could hopefully not have to glue any slats to make it break down super easy. Maybe I'll add some small L brackets to screw them in the back to the legs.  I considered doing a the solid board in the back as you mentioned, but wanted to see just how simple I could keep it- in hindsight it would have made it rock-solid, however.   As far as hiding cables- I plan to move the modem and router to another room- which will only leave a single TV power cable (I'm using a ROKU stick on this that will be able to get power from the USB port- but love the idea of a french cleat shelf if I ever need to add any other boxes."

woodworking,3dyfyl,weekendwoody,19,Mon Jul 20 15:40:43 2015 UTC,"There are a few ways to look at it. First is the niche market. You see it all the time. That guy who finds that niche that people really like and word spreads and he is making sales. Granted that can be a fluke, but I really think finding a niche is really important, in the sense that the cutting board market is flooded so probably not in your best interest to use that as your niche.  The second part is speculation vs commission. Spec is what you are proposing, making a series if pieces and hoping someone will walk by and buy them. You have the advantage of being able to produce several at a time lowering costs, however the sales are not guaranteed. Commission based work means a guaranteed sale, but the cost goes up as they are generally a one off piece. Granted, why not make two at the same time and try to sell the other on spec and cover both markets.   The business of woodworking has always been tricky. The perceived value of the work vs the actual value does not usually jive. So getting paid appropriately for your work can be tough. Name and reputation matters so much in the biz. Guys like Sam Maloof are household names and everyone wants something he made. Also guys like Tommy MacDonald, right place right time and now he has a name and a brand (and a personaliy to match which people dig so he also has the earning potential with online videos/podcasts). So building that rep is super important. When all else fails, say you are a student. People go nuts over that for some reason. As soon as I graduated I was a nobody. But when I was a student people loved my work and wanted to buy something so they could say ""a student made this!"". I don't get it, but whatever works.   You have the time which is awesome. Figuring out what sells is the hard part. One place that always has money is cabinets and built-ins or running millwork. Not the most interesting work but it is generally consistent and finish carpenters and remodelers are always looking for short-run on the fly millwork.   I hope that helps a little."
woodworking,3dyfyl,Titus142,9,Mon Jul 20 16:29:22 2015 UTC,"A decent starting point would be to make something that you would buy for yourself. If you know that you would want to buy it, chances are someone else will too.   Another thing to look at is the raw materials available in your area. Perhaps you live in an area that specializes in a certain species of wood that is rare in other parts of the country.. or perhaps your area has an abundance of reclaimable barn-board, old growth lumber, or trees that have succumbed to disease, etc..   If you want to sell to local markets, study what the local aesthetic generally gravitates towards. Every region has a certain aesthetic that you can aim to compliment with your own style."

Getting an LLC IS fairly easy to obtain for a reasonable price online, however to make it useful and worth the time and money of starting one, one must do their due diligence and follow through on things like opening separate accounts and separating assets, keeping track of payables and receivables, taxes...... Uh oh, where did that extra time go each week?  If OP has any network whatsoever I'm fairly confident that they will amply fill his time.  Making a few types of small products/projects for friends, family, and co-workers and giving them away will do more in regard to keeping you busy and receiving positive word of mouth than other options.

woodworking,3dyfyl,wolv,4,Tue Jul 21 01:06:51 2015 UTC,"I run on a similar budget of hours as you, and I've been doing a steady $400-800/mo without trying very hard.   That's all commission work, and I'm picky about it, since I have a small shop, and I'm mostly doing it for fun. It just takes a little networking and some word of mouth.  I highly recommend being picky about your commissions. I refuse all refinishing and restoration work, since I don't like doing it. It also makes it easy to back away from work that won't make you much money.  Spec work is ok as long as you have the space to safely store new pieces of furniture. I don't (small shop, little inside storage, and 2 little kids that will tear apart everything in their path), so I can't really do any spec.  I've found that if you know your stuff, people will take your suggestions. If they want something painted in a ridiculous way, you can suggest that it might be more fun for them to paint it themselves.   If someone wants something out of maple, but wants it stained dark brown, they might be open to paying a little more for walnut.   Design elements are suggestible, too. Breadboard ends are my biggest thing lately. Everyone wants them at first. When I explain that I'll need to upcharge quite a bit for them, they usually back off. If they don't, it's worth my time.   If a customer wants to fight you on the balance of complexity vs. price, you can always walk away.   All that said, I'd say if you can't be 100% confident in what you can make, you shouldn't try to depend on cash flow from it. Plan on eating the expenses of mistakes, too."

woodworking,3dyfyl,funstuie,5,Mon Jul 20 20:46:07 2015 UTC,I recently made a garden bench someone linked to on pinterest. It's pretty simple design but it looks a bit like this: http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/larnaca-outdoor-coffee-table/  I went to HD and got the straightest and least damaged pine 2x3's and built it one evening. Total material costs $40 (including glue). Time taken to build it approx 4 hours (I fucked up the glue up and ended up having to sand and plane it straight on top).   My neighbor asked me about it (after complaining about the dust I created all over his car) and asked what I would charge to make them one. I said $300 and he just straight up agreed. So I set about making one for him and 8 days later it's still not done. Because I am making it for someone else I have been really particular and making sure it's all perfect. It's a nightmare for me personally. Also as he's right next door I don't want him knocking on my door with something that's fallen apart.    So I should have done what I originally thought and sold him the original for $200 and made a new one for myself and an extra for Craigslist to sell on spec. I will finish it up this week and I am only going to charge him $150 as it's my first and for the reasons above. Also the cost for this one is even less as I used wood I already had so other than $12 for a gallon of glue.  I know this post doesn't really help you but as someone else said start out making something you would want/buy and go from there. Garden furniture is really popular and really easy to make something look good.

Maybe Ana White type stuff. I know a lot of it is ""crappy"" woodworking, but some of that stuff sells. Just make sure you make things a bit better.  I stayed at a cabin in June on vacation and the entire inside was recently remodeled.  It looked like it was ripped straight off from Pinterest. From the pallet wood sink cabinet to the pallet wood bed to the light fixture made out of mason jars. That type of rustic and rough design is pretty hot right now, and the stuff it is made of is the cheapest stuff available. So the profitis in the difference in cost of material vs. Selling price.    You could try to do some really awesome fine woodworking, with nice fine exotics, hand cut dovetails, but I'd save that for when you are established, and maybe have a reputation.  Maybe just try to whip out as many rustic looking pinteresty garden benches made out of pine you can do and see if they sell.

woodworking,3e0oh8,dstampfli,3,Tue Jul 21 08:01:28 2015 UTC,"I think there's more going on here than just steam.  There are several bendable plywoods (eg. Wiggle Wood) that can be glued up and stiffened in a form.  There's a possibility that these shapes are formed, glued up, and then veneered afterwards.  The first picture shows lamination of thin layers.  These layers could be pre formed with steam or ammonia and glued up together in place.  The tricky part us getting the surfaces (edges and faces) trued up and smoothed after the piece is formed.  They could also be using an ultra-sonic glue.  This method allows a long time for wood to be clamped up and positioned.  The glue then cures instantly once ultra-sonic waves are applied.  I would be interested in seeing the process for these.  Many artists don't really want people to know all the secrets - especially if it's their signature style.  Why make it easier for others to recreate your work?  The method might be a guarded secret.  Hopefully someone can come forward with the way to do this."

Just one thing that stuck out - if you hire a photographer again, ask them to use plain Savage brand ""thunder grey"" or ""studio grey"" or white paper as the background. (It comes in rolls up to 107"" wide and any photographer should know what you're talking about). Imo the busy-ness of the fabric grey background competes with your piece a bit in these photos."
woodworking,3dwjts,corbu_,5,Mon Jul 20 03:25:57 2015 UTC,There is a world renowned bar maker Wallace and Hinz in my small community area that buys tons and tons of mahogany.

woodworking,3dwjts,extralongusername,4,Mon Jul 20 03:30:03 2015 UTC,I was going to say exactly the same thing about the background being way too busy for that wood.

And I get why the photog did what he did.. he's going for ""art"" photograpy.. rather than setting off the piece as the focal point of the shot.

But the rear light, the reflection.. they kinda detract from the piece itself.. and could be considered insulting to the turner.. the piece should stand on it's own, and not require reflections, etc, to beef it up.   I like the photo though."

Since then I have really enjoyed all the projects and collecting mostly second hand tools and fiddling with them but not really doing woodworking. I know this isn't much and I didn't achieve my vision but I learned a ton (mostly about finishing). I decided to post anyways because we all start somewhere.

woodworking,3dtujz,PirateAdventurer,44,Sun Jul 19 13:18:36 2015 UTC,"First off, I'll apologize for a lack of build pics. When a lot of your progress is during kids' nap times, stopping to take photos falls to the wayside.   After finishing my Roubo workbench, (soon to be posted) it felt sacrilegious to keep using a big-box-store rubber mallet on the holdfasts and such so I wanted to build a traditional joiners mallet. I used this website as my guide. The only differences being that I dispensed with the domed head and I added weight by drilling 1-1/4"" holes in each end of the center lamination and filled them with lead shot to give it a dead-blow effect.   The lamination pattern of Wenge, Paduak, and Maple was just something I'd wanted to try before but as I started to shape the handle to my hand, (no lathe, spokeshave, or rasp; so a lot of bevels) I couldn't stop thinking that it looked like a damn war hammer...so I ran with it. The handle seemed to beg for leather to be woven around it so, while completing the head and applying finish, I learned how to tie a  long 4-bight Turk's Head knot from here and a Turk's Head bracelet became the lanyard. (I want to hang it on one of my bench legs) I swear, I spent more hours on that than the mallet build!   Just before the leather work, I applied 3 coats of Maloof Finish. (1/3 BLO, 1/3 Pure Tung Oil, 1/3 Minwax Clear Gloss Poly)   I know it's a bit over the top for a simple joiners mallet but man, it was fun to make, and that's why I do this. I'd be happy to answer any questions or take constructive criticism from anyone who has them!  Edit: A large lacing needle is definitely a requirement for this kind of leather/paracord work. It's damn near impossible to do it without it."
woodworking,3dtujz,photographic_mammory,9,Sun Jul 19 12:12:15 2015 UTC,"Wow dude, that looks stunning! It's a real inspiration. Do you sketch out some kind of design of how you want it to look like first?"
woodworking,3dtujz,photographic_mammory,7,Sun Jul 19 12:46:40 2015 UTC,"No, I just started shaping it off the top of my head. I'm really limited by my lack of lathe, spokeshave, or rasp (they're on the short list) so I used a table saw, (with x-cut sled), bandsaw, and a router with a chamfer bit and V-groove bit. I can try to walk you through how I shaped the grip, it'll just take a bit since it's definitely easier to explain with pics.  Edit: and thank you so much for the compliment!"
woodworking,3dtujz,gpto,4,Sun Jul 19 13:11:41 2015 UTC,"This is cool.  I like that you linked to the website that shows how you attached the handle.

woodworking,3dtujz,engagechad,3,Sun Jul 19 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"This is awesome, seriously, and now I'm going to say a tidbit that will sound critical.  I don't mean to be critical, but I don't see it mentioned, so, I'm going to.  Generally, a good woodworking mallet should be made of fairly soft wood, so that it is unlikely to mar the work pieces.  Usually, ash, soft maple, or something similar.  Often, they are made of denser woods, with a thick piece of softer wood attatched to the striking surfaces, so that you can have the benefit of the weight while still having a soft material for striking.  This is seriously splitting hairs, though.  This will be just fine most of the time, and when using it against softer woods, you can always use a soft block as something of a stiking plate or shim, and the potential problem is nixed.  Just felt like nerding out for anyone that didn't think about it.  I'm a bit jealous.  Its beautiful.  The shop's own Mjolinor (that can't be spelled right)."
woodworking,3dtujz,engagechad,2,Sun Jul 19 19:13:11 2015 UTC,Not critical at all and I appreciate the information! I will remember that if or when I need to build another. This is my first mallet and I thought density and hardness was where it's at. Thanks for the tip and the kind words!
woodworking,3dtujz,CoolHandIckx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:23:10 2015 UTC,I think it awesome how it is and seeing as its purpose is to hit holdfasts and chisels as apposed to the work surface itself it will work well being made from hard wood.

woodworking,3e1029,Man_Bear_Sheep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:16:29 2015 UTC,"Grain orientation is important for tool handles. If you're looking at the end-grain of the handle, you want the grain lines to be running in the direction of motion of the tool. They're stronger that way.  As for what wood, the classic tool handle woods are hickory, ash, and oak, in roughly that order of preference.  Depending on how big of a head you're actually going to have on that thing, you might also consider tapering the handle so that it's fatter (stronger) at the head, but tapers down to a thinner, more comfortable diameter down where you'll be gripping it."
woodworking,3e1029,p2p_editor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:21:09 2015 UTC,"would that be strong enough?    Glue joints are as strong or stronger than the surrounding wood if done right, that answer your question?   I'm mostly concerned about the long handle snapping.   Choose the wood for this carefully. Or make a lamination.  If you go with a solid wood handle you want to use something with natural springyness or resilience, not hardness and stiffness... this is why ash in Europe and hickory (note: sapwood specifically) were favoured for handle stock.  Basics of grain orientation for the handle IF using solid wood."

woodworking,3dy5ik,override11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:57 2015 UTC,I thought the whole point of the oil/wax was to keep stuff from seeping into the wood and allow it to self-heal a little around the knife marks giving the bad stuff less places to grow?
woodworking,3dy5ik,Titus142,2,Mon Jul 20 16:36:53 2015 UTC,"I thought the whole point of the oil/wax was to keep stuff from seeping into the wood    That's the idea, it's just that it's not actually the best thing in practice.   Bacteria actually doesn't grow well on or within wood (i.e. in scratches) because the wood kills it by dehydration. That's apparently the primary anti-bacterial action of wood, and why species that people often discount as viable board material actually are good choices, like pine."

But there is plenty of suggestive evidence that it's not necessary.  Before either of us were born they didn't oil cutting boards, and some of those are still around and in usable condition. That should be a long enough service life for anyone :-)  I actually have a cutting board that came down to be through my family that's older than the average age of posters on Reddit. It has been soaked in water overnight numerous times (before it came into my hands) and used as a trivet for hundreds of hot pans. Presumably it was oiled when it was made, but has never been oiled since. But despite that it's still in great shape, with only one joint opening up in one spot.

This is a less demanding/questionable operation than planing end grain.  If your glue joints are executed properly, they will be stronger than the wood, so I wouldn't worry about the thing exploding in the planer.  You will almost definitely get spelching at the end of the cut. Glue a sacrificial board there to take the brunt of it and that aspect should be taken care of. Realize that at the end of the cut, a small chunk of the sacrificial board may fly out of the input side of the planer at speed. Be out of the way and wear your eye protection just in case."

Take lighter than normal passes. Your shavings will be large and may clog dust collection. You may get tear out on the trailing edge as well, so you shouldn't cut it to final dimensions yet."

Used purple heart (just about the hardest wood available around where I live) paduk and maple (also pretty hard). Ran it though about 20+ times on each face.   The key is to only take a couple thousands off each pass. And run it though a couple times at each thickness. I have the Dewaly 735 set to the highest cuts per in. setting. Each turn of the hand wheel is 1/16 of an inch. I usually turn the wheel about 1/16 of a turn each pass. That means I'm taking off 1/256 of an inch each pass. It takes forever but I'd rather not have to go out and but a replacement motor. Or worse.   As for grain going the opposite direction. Just make sure you take light passes and add strips at the ends and cut them off after so the blades chip out the stips and not the finished piece."

I can't say that I'm all that knowledgeable about this table saw but I'd spent a great deal of time researching hybrid table saws and this would've been exactly what I was looking for. I ended up with a what's essentially a Powermatic 63A (debranded version) and a Delta T2 fence for $400. I couldn't be happier with it. The guy I bought it from had upgraded to almost the exact same Rigid that you linked (just a newer version).

If the top is solid wood, the only way to eliminate the darkness is to go deeper - as in removing more wood off the top until you are below the damage.  If the top is veneered (or a thin wood layer over something else), then the repair is more difficult because you can't enough of the surface off.  A patch could be glued in, but that might be more noticeable yet.  Hopefully the top is solid all the way thru and you are able to get past the damage.  Side note:  I walked thru IKEA yesterday and was dismayed to see that solid wood is disappearing.  They are making furniture to look like solid wood, but if you read the fine print you see that they are gluing 1/4"" solid wood over particleboard."
woodworking,3dzq6e,dstampfli,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:20:30 2015 UTC,You need to go deeper. Instead of sanding you should consider planing or using a card scraper.

Any solid wood would be prone to breaking along the short grain side of the ring.  You could always use thin layers of any hardwood (maple, oak, walnut, etc) glued up with each layer's grain running in a different direction.  Essentially you would be making fancy plywood.  If you want fancy plywood go this route.  If you want the simplest way to make strong wooded rings, use plywood and laminate several layers as instructed."

A large industrial fiberglass tank would do the trick.  Use a copious amount of rice (like a truckload) and ensure that the wood is complete surrounded on all sides.  Change the rice out periodically, and your wood will become very dry.  Given the cost of the tank and the large amount of rice needed, you might be better off putting it in a dry location and waiting."

woodworking,3dye49,commodore_nate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:42:33 2015 UTC,"Since you're going to be at harbor freight, you should get the chisels and a sharpening stone or diamond plates. The chisels will need the backs flattened on sandpaper after you get em.  I tried a roubo bench build a while ago using a very similar toolset. I intended to make a slab top from 2x4s and legs from 4x12s. To this day, the slab top has sat on some saw horses, and my 4x12s have some big mortises (actually just huge holes) in them.  I am now building the naked woodworker bench, because my saw horse bench is way too low and I need a bench more than I need a roubo.  If you are going to build one out of construction lumber, here is what I recommend from my failed experiment:   minimize the amount of dimensioning you need to do. I tried to plane the round over off my 2x4s, and it was murder. I spent a week of nights after work planing against a wall only to glue up my top and find out that my bench was wavier than the ocean. Cheat the mortises and tenons by laminating parts together. Instead of chopping a hole into a slab, glue the parts so that there is a hole. Instead of cutting out a tenon, glue your legs so that one part is longer than the rest. Don't use 2x4s. Seriously, don't, they're full of knots and hard to reference flat along their length. Get long 2x8 or 2x10 and rip it down the middle, since those are clearer and straighter. This might seem like it goes against my first piece of advice, but you still have reference edges on each plank to help you find flat. Finally, be honest with what you want in a bench. Halfway through, I realized that I just wanted a bench that worked, not necessarily a roubo. I wanted to make boxes and furniture, not benches. But if you want a gorgeous bench and are willing to take the time to get there, more power to you - just acknowledge that and stick to it.   Best of luck! And sharpen those saws."

I spent over an hour pulling lumber from a stack at Lowe's and still got some that were warped once they dried more. However, the whole thing was only a little over $100... more manpower, but if you're on a tight budget, you may have to make do with inferior lumber.   If you can afford the bigger pieces and your saws are straight, ripping would likely get you a lot better wood.   Good luck with the acquisition and build!"
woodworking,3dye49,abnormal_human,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:12:07 2015 UTC,"You want a deep backsaw if you're going to build a workbench. Make sure that the throat depth is deep enough to cut the deepest tenon you need to cut (on a true-to-the-original Roubo, this is probably the through tenons that join the legs to the top). This might be called a ""tenon saw"" or a ""sash saw"". 8-11TPI, rip or hybrid.  If you can find room in the budget for two backsaws, something moderately sized and crosscut or hybrid filed (a ""carcase saw"") will come in handy. It will be better for shoulder cuts, and for some of the operations around the dovetailed end cap.  You are going to want a wide chisel (1.5"" or so). You've got a lot of chunky tenons to clean up after sawing. There are more expensive ways to solve this (like a rabbeting or shoulder plane) too.  You've got mortises to cut. A couple of ways you could go here. If you're going to bang them out with just a chisel, mortising chisels will be a benefit. You could also hog out most of the waste with a brace and bit and then use bench chisels to clean up the walls.   Flattening a workbench with just a #5 is possible, but difficult. If possible, try to find a jointer plane (#7 or 8) too. Thinking back to my bench build, I don't think I used any other bench planes.  Also, you'll want good marking tools. A good square, marking knife, and some gauges.  And one last piece of advice: consider building your bench out of a softwood like Douglas-Fir or Southern Yellow Pine.

I made the recess by using my compound square to draw a line parallel to the top.  Next I created a perpendicular line going down from center to the length I wanted and used some plastic french curves to draw the curves connecting the top line to the center point below.    Using these lines (along with a straight edge and the french curves as guides) I cut into the lid with my marking knife.  I created knife walls back to the lines with my chisels being careful on the curves and then used my router plane to bring the depth of the rest of the recess down.

woodworking,3dv79x,Birdman3000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:09:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think a harder wood will move less.  In fact, according to the source I linked to above, it will move more.  But all wood moves, unless you're using plywood.    Think of wood as a sponge.  If it's super dry/cold out the sponge is dry and shrivels up.  If it's really humid/hot then the sponge will expand.  Now think of that sponge only expanding/contracting in ONE direction.  That's wood.  Generally speaking, it will only expand and contract along its width - getting wider and narrower but staying the same length.  Depending on how wide the board or panel, the expansion can be a little or a lot - the source I linked above says that a 10"" wide oak board will expand/contract 1/4"" throughout the year.  Because wood is a sponge, you absolutely have to account for it in your design unless you're using plywood.  For a good example, read up on the traditional frame-and-panel design for doors.  You'll find out that a traditional frame-and-panel door (a design you see all day, every day, everywhere) is designed as it is precisely to account for wood movement.  The panel (a large piece of wood that moves with the seasons) is suspended in a frame, sitting in a groove that's cut in the frame.  That way, the panel can expand and contract with the seasons, and it just does so in the grooves in the frame.  The frame - because it's fairly narrow wood - won't move much and so it can stay the same size in the door frame.  That's why you don't see doors that are just bigass pieces of wood (unless they're veneereed plywood) - they'd move way too much and get stuck in the door frame (in the summer) and leave huge gaps (in the winter).  This principle - design must account for movement - guides all design of hardwood furniture.    But don't sweat it too hard, seriously.  I'd wager that the vast majority of people who get into wodworking have built pieces that underestimate wood movement and wind up running into a little trouble.  But that's all part of the fun - making stuff, not doing it 100% perfectly, learning a bunch, then making more stuff."

Now there's abralon and abranet, what are the notable differences if any?"
woodworking,3dxx5z,Graphus,2,Mon Jul 20 15:42:40 2015 UTC,"The abranets are like mesh net. The abralon pads are foam. Both are hook and loop. I use them both. The abranets go up to 600 grit, I think. The abralons go up to 4000.  You'll still end up with the balls on the abranets. I tend to get them when I don't let the surface cure long enough."
woodworking,3dxx5z,JohnChivez,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"Obligatory shoutout for card scraping instead of heavy sanding.    I think my problem was that I set the speed at the highest, lol, and so I had problems with the mesh clogging up and then those clogs messing up the finish by making little scratches.   Yup, that would do it.   At higher speeds not only is there more dust being generated which can overload the ability of the mesh to allow it through, you're generating heat which can 'melt' the finish which obviously will then clump together.   Just sanding bare wood and generating too much heat you can activate the lignin making your wood dust sticky.   People suggest to wash them with some dish wash detergent.    That might work but it would depend on what the clumps are composed of I think."

The prices possibly cracked and beat up planes are going for on Ebay and at antique shops are comparable with brand new decent quality ones.   My first suggestion is figure out what you actually need (rather than what you want), and build the collection slowly, from the basic tools up. Router planes are nice.. but you can do most of the same stuff with a chisel, etc.   ALl that said.. craigslist, ebay, local ""yard sale"" forums, drive a bit West and Lancaster area is covered in flea markets, antique sales, etc, heck, Lancaster itself, due to the rather large amish population tends to carry a better selection of ""new' hand tools in hardware stores, etc. (As well as cast iron, oil lamps, pretty much the entire Lehman's catalog, on the shelf)."

woodworking,3dydc0,jtok202,2,Mon Jul 20 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"Depending on how the wood is cut, you can dry it two ways.  Kiln drying is fast, but makes the wood more difficult to work with.  Air drying takes about a year for every inch of board thickness.  It also depends on how you would like the wood to be sawn.  Quartersawn cherry is really stable, flatsawn has more of the look people are used to when they think of cherry.  Do you already have someone with a wood mizer to mill the boards?"

I have a large basement that is dry and temperature controlled for the storage of wood once milled or in logs less than 15 ft in length. If I leave it a log form it will take a very long time to dry then? Is there a reason I can't use the wood green in some projects?

Begin pushing with the right hand. Once you have solid control with the push stick, and are passing by the blad, take your left hand and grab the left corner of the table saw. This keeps the free hand from doing something dumb like trying to reach around the back of the blade. Was taught this at my school, made it a habit and has done me well thus far. My old boss... not so much. Had he practiced that he might still have the tips of his left ring and pinky. This trick also gives you a lot of stability as you finish the cut.

If you're planning on painting the end product then you can just go with pine, but poplar is slightly nicer to work with, doesn't cost much more and also paints nicely (some woodworkers always paint poplar when they use it).  I would have said tools were your main obstacle here since getting what you need just for one project makes it really not economically viable but you say you have what you need so that's good. With a simple piece like this you can get away with just the one saw, a hammer and nails or screwdriver and screws, maybe an electric drill, plus some sandpaper.   Re. sanding, wrap the paper around a scrap of wood as a crude sanding block rather than sanding with the paper just folded over and held in the fingers, works much better this way.  Now design is the hardest thing here since nobody can just describe in words what you need to do. Good news is there's a vibrant amateur woodworking scene online so I'm sure there are existing projects posted for shot-glass racks (or something similar enough you can adapt it easily) possibly with plans but at least with step-by-step photos of the build.

woodworking,3dwqbm,JustWiggl3s,2,Mon Jul 20 04:13:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm making one myself but without a chef in mind. Biggest consideration for her would probably be the wheels, the top, and the heft.   For pastry work it will have to be able to stop and stay stopped. Castors with brakes may work, but it depends on how you can make that look. Maybe have two solid legs that you lift and rear legs with brake castors.  Second is the top. Butcher block may work but you might see if you can find a chunk of marble insert that can be removed and fit in your fridge (great for keeping dough cool). If you prefer to go bigger you can always just keep a few cold packs in the freezer to set on it on it to keep it cool. You might be able to scrounge a scrap if you call around to a few stone places, or even steal a good sized floor tile. Granite can work but the problem is that it has to be sealed well without texture.  Heft is good, pastry tables are usually a bit overbuilt since you will be pushing and pulling and putting your weight on it. You may have to go pretty thick on the legs or give it a back and sides or braces(if you are up for it) to prevent rocking. Height is also a consideration, but I'm short on ideas for teasing her ergonomic preferences without giving away the surprise. Some go a bit below regular counter height so you can use your weight, but for aesthetics you may want it level with your current counters and you can just make her a little half-step stool if she needs it.  Oh, and spots to slide her rolling pin(s) and a slots or magnet for a dough scraper or two."

woodworking,3dudtx,With_which_I_will_no,4,Sun Jul 19 17:09:45 2015 UTC,"There are a few things that must be conquered to produce a picture frame:   Milling square, straight frame material Cutting miters Reinforcing the miter joint somehow Cutting rabbets   As is typical in Woodworking, there are many ways to accomplish each. I completed two frames last week, and this post is causing me to reflect on the fact that I used well in excess of $15,000 in equipment to turn $15 worth of lumber into a pair of large, but plain frames. This is because I have big machines on hand that make many of the sub-tasks involved very simple, and because I was starting with rough lumber that needed to be milled and dimensioned. You are almost certainly looking for a simpler path.  I suggest that you try to buy S4S material that's as straight as possible (nothing will be as perfect as fresh material milled in your shop, but you can get close enough for a picture frame). This gets you past the most equipment-intensive and arduous part.  You can cut miters with a miter saw, a table saw + miter gauge, or a hand saw + miter box. A miter shooting board + hand plane may also be helpful if going the hand tools route. Whatever you do, it's very important that your angles be spot on, or at least that each pair adds up to exactly 90 degrees. If not, your frame will not work properly--this is trickier than it seems at first to get right. Don't trust the tools. Verify.  There are plenty of ways to reinforce a miter, too. A hand saw kerf or two with a scrap inserted is more than sufficient for a picture frame. You can also use the table saw and a sled to cut key slots that way. There are router table setups available that will accomplish the same thing. Thinking in more traditional terms, a mitered bridle joint is a possibility.  (As are several other joints if you're not married to the mitered appearance--half laps, bridles, mortise+tenon, ... all can be used to build a frame).  I happen to like using loose tenons to reinforce miters (but only because I have a machine that makes it really easy!). The nice thing about this approach is that you end up with basically a self-squaring joint, since the tenons prevent lateral slippage of the miters. This makes the glue-up painless.  Rabbets can be cut with a table saw, router, rabbeting plane, or even a chisel, marking gauge, and some patience.  I think the route you take will depend on the tools you have access to and how broad your woodworking goals are. Probably the quickest path to good results is to buy a table saw and a sander, and some S2S or S3S material from the home center, and start cranking out frames."
woodworking,3dudtx,abnormal_human,2,Sun Jul 19 18:33:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on what tools you have. A miter saw is best for a standard 45 degree miter joint, but the saw has to be setup correctly to give you a gapless joint. A table saw also works well with an accurate miter gauge. I recommend adding splines for strength. Lee valley makes a nice jig to make the frame square or you can make one from a sheet of plywood with two runners set at 90 degrees."

woodworking,3dudtx,darkehawk14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:45:44 2015 UTC,"I make them pretty much entirely with a table saw. Start off by cutting the wood to final thickness and width. I rough cut the 4 pieces by hand, adding a little extra for waste. Cut out rabbits next. Use a miter sled I made for the table saw and cut each end to final length. Glue together using a strap clamp. Lastly I cut splines in the corners to add support.   From there you can sand and then finish as you want. I either cut out plexiglass on the table saw or have lowes cut a piece of glass to the needed size since I'm terrible at breaking it cleanly.  There are many good videos on YouTube on how to make a miter sled. I'd say that's the most important piece to have other than a table saw."
woodworking,3dudtx,JSolUA,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:36:32 2015 UTC,"No one else mentioned.  Besides your corners adding up to 90 the opposite sides of the frame have to be EXACTLY the same length or no matter how perfect your 45's might be, you'll have gaps.  A miter sled where you cut each side of a corner on each side of the sled plus using a stop block for exactly the same lengths for the 2 pairs of sides pretty much guarantees success."

I invested in a web clamp with a few 90° pads for the corners and it's a much tighter miter then with standard clamps or the tape method. I usually like to throw in a couple splines for strength (and aesthetics) afterwards with a really simple jig I made after watching a drunken workers spline jig tutorial on YouTube.
woodworking,3dudtx,WustacheMax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:04:16 2015 UTC,"I just made one myself. I used the Kreg Precision Miter System. It worked fantastically. I using a biscuit joiner to add some strength to the miters as I didn't want to build another jig for splines.    The problem I ran into, and this is my first frame, is that the dry fit was smooth and perfect. But wood glue swells those biscuits and makes the actual glue up way harder than you'd think. I was racing the clock on glue drying time because I used Titebond I. And the clamps kept knocking the frame out of alignment. I had a frame clamping jig but it sucked and was hard to use.    Elsewhere in this thread there is a Lee Valley frame clamp, I like the looks of that and plan to buy it. The previous one I had was one of those metal spider looking things with adjustable corner pads that you move. I just hated it.    So my advice is use longer open time glue - titebond extended perhaps. Also making sure you have a really good clamping jig, consider splines over biscuits because of the swelling that made it a pain in the butt."
woodworking,3dudtx,BigCliffowski,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:07:21 2015 UTC,Consider learning about and using a shooting board & shooting plane to true up your miters.  This way your initial cut (by hand or machine) does not need to be accurate - only long.  Finish up the miters on a shooting board and you will have perfect miter joints 100% of the time.
woodworking,3dudtx,dstampfli,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:11 2015 UTC,"My #1 recommendation would be to make your own clamps (see this recent post for one type). You'll save enough money not buying various mitre clamps that you could virtually buy every other tool you need.  Obviously if you want to do this as inexpensively as possible you'll have to go the handtool route, which is possible but can require a lot of effort. One of the things most often not realised by people who want to make frames is that you can save on a significant chunk of this effort by not having to cut rebates (rabbets) in your frame pieces, as in most commercial frames. Instead you build up your frames from smaller pieces.   Not only does this simplify construction but it reduces the number of tools needed to only a handful. At the most basic you can do it with just one hammer, one mitre box and backsaw. Although to get really tight mitres you should probably get a plane as well, to be able to fine-tune your joints in a mitre shooting board, figure 2 here. A build diagram of another type here, although I'd move that 2"" piece on the bottom to the edge closest to the viewer (the 12"" side)."

woodworking,3dune3,mullinz,6,Sun Jul 19 17:20:29 2015 UTC,"Here are some general rules to buying planes (or any old tool) on ebay.  First, it helps to have handled them in person, so I recommend hitting up a flea market to look at some planes. It also helps if you have restored an old tool before. Although restoring a chisel is different than restoring a plane is different than restoring a brace, you learn a lot about restoring rust buckets. It's also usually cheaper.  Second, read the online sources. Patrick leach's blood and gore, and the hyperkitten type study, are your go to learning tool for planes. There's the disstonian institute for saws, then another one for Miller's falls braces - it's out there.  Third, know the market prices and know what is hot. Any plane with a fraction at the end or a 6 in front of it is super hot right now. So is any tool that Chris Schwarz or Paul Sellers has mentioned recently. Any tool made before WWI is more than a tool made between the wars (usually). Number 4&5 planes hover between $30-65 before shipping, depending on condition, type/age, and popularity. Number 7 planes are closer to $80.  Buying ""generic"" brand planes is a good way to go. For example, if it looks old, looks like a bailey pattern, and is a brand you haven't heard of, it's probably a stanley made copy. These tend to be cheaper but will still plane wood fine.  Finally, make sure the listings have lots of pictures. That's all you have to go off of with ebay."

Only one came in a workable condition, that would actually make shavings, and that was a Stanley #35, tranistional--Bailey mechanism with a wood body. It's highly unlikely anything you get will be shop ready. It's incredible how terrible the previous owners of my planes let the blades get.  Any old beat-up rusty old plane with cracked handles can work, so long as the plane iron (the part that does the cutting) is in good shape. (I ""restore"" all mine, but that does not make them cut any better. It's like racing strips on a car.) Some rust is okay, pitting is NOT. Rust and pitting usually go hand in hand. Sometimes the pitting's on the business end, sometimes not.   Most sellers don't bother to give you detailed photos of the part that matters. If they don't 100% dissassemble and show you both sides of everything, walk away. Otherwise it's a gamble. Pretty much everything can be repared without much work, but if the plane iron's shot, expect to spend 30-40 bucks on a new one. Forty bucks ontop of a 40 dollar number four is just unfourtunate.  I've not bought from this guy, but he does sell shop-ready Stanleys: http://www.ebay.com/sch/johnfire1940/m.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_ipg=&_from= I don't think you'll go wrong here, but expect to pay a little extra for his work--he repaints, removes rust, polishes.

You sign up for his mailing list here: http://www.supertool.com/oldtools.htm Then it's first-come-first-serve if you see a tool you like. If it's something common he can probably hook you up with something similar if you miss a particular piece. There's also this: http://www.hyperkitten.com/tools/ForSale/Tools_FS.php which doesn't hide behind a mailing list, but I haven't used it. And this looks promising as well: http://www.vintagetools.net/catalog it has Stanley #5's from $50-$65"
woodworking,3dune3,AMillionMonkeys,2,Mon Jul 20 04:01:41 2015 UTC,"I also feel that you would be overpaying at $100. I have been grabbing some old ones from flea markets, I have about 4 that I hope to work on when I have the time. If you don't mind spending the time cleaning them up, and sharpening the plane iron - it's good to go at it to restore one that you intend to work with (IMHO). I was able to utilize the templates here Lee Valley templates to shape and drill a new tote for one old Stanley that I nabbed for $15 (because the tote was split and the plane iron had not been taken care of) but the sole was perfectly flat and the tote bolt and frog were in great condition."
woodworking,3dune3,shibbidoosh,0,Mon Jul 20 00:18:59 2015 UTC,"On eBay, $100 for a #7 is on the lower side. I got my type 19 #7 off eBay for $80. Mostly because the japanning was shot.

I'm sure there are other uses too."
woodworking,3dvcfr,gonzo123100,3,Sun Jul 19 20:52:00 2015 UTC,Have you tried using a stiff wire brush to see if any comes up. I also sometimes use WD-40 it works great for taking rust off of tools as well as preserving them. The whole point of WD-40 is to remove water from anything and my grandpa use to spray some in his tool box to keep water out and the looked brand new when he passed away.
woodworking,3dvcfr,dfoley1313,2,Sun Jul 19 22:19:13 2015 UTC,I have the same saw and had to clean mine up alot too. I used steel wool and wd-40. It took alot of elbow grease but once it came up it works amazingly.  You could also try PB-Blaster if the WD-40 isn't working. Also after you get it cleaned go over it with some wood wax. It will help keep the surface nice and the wood sliding smooth.
woodworking,3dvcfr,Tyguy735,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:31 2015 UTC,First I would take a putty knife and scrape off everything that you can.    Normally I would say 600 grit sandpaper with WD-40.  In this instance I would start with 400 grit and move to 600 after you get through most of it.
woodworking,3dvcfr,TomVa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:22:11 2015 UTC,"The right side of the table is pretty much shot. The small parts can be disassembled and soaked in EvapORust. I've had very good luck with the stuff. Sand away as much rust on the top as you can, and wire brush the pitting. You may be able to repair it with Bondo or a similar auto body filler. I'm not sure if the miter slot will ever be useful. May I ask how much you spent on it? If you didn't spend too much, you may be able to rehab the motor and sell it seperately, then look for one in better shape. I wouldn't sink very much into trying to save that one, as much as it pains me to say it. Trying to save money by attempting to fix tools in rough shape has cost me more than paying a little more up front."
woodworking,3dvcfr,frankssawdustfactory,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:07:19 2015 UTC,"I ended up paying $115 for everything. I wasn't so sure if it was a good deal or not but after a year and a half of woodworking with out a table saw, I was very excited and not patient at all. In my mind I was sure that I could clean it ALL up and make it look new. But if it's that bad to the point where I can't clean it up properly or even use that specific miter slot then I may end up selling the damn thing."
woodworking,3dvcfr,frankssawdustfactory,3,Mon Jul 20 03:52:27 2015 UTC,"Don't get too discouraged. Nothing is beyond repair if you have the time, knowledge, and resources. It does look rough from the pictures, but it may be salvageable. You may even be able to find a replacement top from a similar model fo' free if you keep an eye on craigslist. Build up a badass frankensaw."
woodworking,3dvcfr,480v_bite,2,Mon Jul 20 04:04:33 2015 UTC,"Don't get discouraged. I just acquired a similar table saw but mine in the flex drive (I know, I know but it was free) and it had a rusted top too. Not as bad as yours, minor pitting but not significant.   I used a paint and rust removal wheel with an angle grinder from Home Depot. If you don't have an angle grinder, they are relatively cheap. I think I paid $40 for a Porter Cable and it works well. The wheels are about $10 each. I used 2 for my top, I'd recommend 2 or 3 wheels at least for you. They also make the wheels for drills but I don't know how well they work.   Try and stay away from any edges, it eats up the wheel fast.   After I got all of the rust off, I blew off the dust, wiped with water and rag, dried well, then applied 2 coats of Rustoleum Rust Stop primer. I allowed the second coat to dry really well and then rubbed paste wax into the table. It's now very smooth and flat.   Once you get the rust off, you might want to bondo the pitting in the right hand side of the table to get out smooth and level, then paint (if you want to paint).   All that said, you could also look online for another saw that is the same or similar model and pick it up and use it for parts.   Please let us know how it turns out for you  Edit: I didn't realize that I have some of the same information as the other guy that replied to this comment, so credit to him.   Also, using the rust removal chemicals is all well and great but trying to get that much rust off by hand with sand paper or steel wool is just punishing yourself. I took the rust off mine in about 30 minutes with the angle grinder and wasn't sore after lol"

woodworking,3dun8m,Couchtiger23,2,Sun Jul 19 17:31:29 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest the bevel up smoother or the low angle smoother instead of the #4. The bevel up orientation gives a lot more versatility.

woodworking,3dun8m,arcticamt6,3,Mon Jul 20 04:29:07 2015 UTC,"If there's going to be a lot of large pieces of wood on that headboard and you want him to make some larger pieces in the future (think dressers, kitchen tables, entertainment systems) then eventually he is going to need a jointer (like a #7 or #8).  Normal sizes for those are 22"" long for #7 and the 24"" long for a #8.  If you guys are fairly well off money wise and you really want to treat him, you can get him a a Veritas jointer (these cost $400) or a Lie Nelsen would send him over the edge (these costs $425).  To give you a background, so you know the purpose of planes, they are used for flattening boards (taking millimeter shavings of wood off) and giving the surface a smooth finish (that would be a smoothing plane and something like a #4 or 4 1/2, where the #7 or #8 are longer to guarantee your board comes out straight).  You don't have to spend a whole lot though.  While I would LOVE for my wife to surprise me with a Lie Nelsen, I know we can't afford that, at all.  I mean, it's way out there.  You can find some nice ones on eBay, your local craigslist, garage sales, flea markets and antique stores (note: antique stores will normally be VERY expensive cause they are pintrest a-holes who mark things up cause they are vintage).  My wife got me a wood block jointer instead of one of the iron/steel/brass ones.  Something like this.  Mine wasn't in that great of shape, it looked more like this, but it didn't have all those cracks.  Wood ones will cost less some times and as long as there's no major cracks or dead gouges on the bottom, he can just use sandpaper to flatten in, while the metal ones require a lot more work if there is any damage or warping.  Couple coats of oil on my wood jointer and it looks like a very well kept plane.  Let me know if there's anything you need clarifying or if you are set on a #4 or 4 1/2 (they are the same just little longer on the 4 1/2), feel free to ask.  Hopefully we can find something that your husband will like and be surprised at the same time."
woodworking,3dun8m,Drewology,3,Sun Jul 19 18:08:49 2015 UTC,"Almost everyone is recommending the two most expensive mass-market brands available in the North American market to you. They're beautifully made and finished (generally speaking the Lie-Nielsen's have the edge over Veritas) and TBH anyone would be over the moon to receive one as a gift. But they are top money in this sector of the market and frankly you don't have to pay that much for the performance; if buying an antique was an option for example a plane 1/10 the price (!) could work exactly as well.  Assuming you need to buy new and you'd like a cheaper option to weigh, the WoodRiver planes from Woodcraft.com are well worth your consideration. Here's a previous thread discussing them.  I was going to suggest you get a no. 4 and a no. 6 as a good size pairing. And also to get a low-angle block plane too if money allows. That was without remembering the specifics of the set mentioned in the opening post of the thread above, which is all three of these planes! And as you can see it's slightly less than some individual planes from other makers."
woodworking,3dun8m,Graphus,2,Mon Jul 20 09:51:09 2015 UTC,"Lie-Nielsen #4  The Veritas linked below is a fine plane as well, but I think the Lie Nielsen planes are a lot nicer looking.  A lot of people that get just one wind up with this low-angle jack for its versatility. It's a little longer than a 4, which makes it more suited to flattening things but it's still short enough for smoothing too.  A block plane is also an extremely handy addition to any woodworker's kit. Of the ones listed here, the ""small block planes"" or the ""adjustable mouth block planes"" are the most useful - the others are kind of for more specialized situations."

You could do this stuff on a regular router table. It's just easier with this one because they provide all sorts of templates on how to make these design and the templates conveniently slip into the fence so you know where to make the cuts.

The end result is a board that I can tell was oiled and waxed, but not oily or waxy at all on the surface."
woodworking,3du4h9,UtilityPole,2,Sun Jul 19 14:17:49 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you have the right idea. First, chemically strip as much as possible (wear gloves, all strippers burn, the chemical kind and the club kind, or so says my dad😉) then sand it down to the bare wood. Start with a course grit paper (like an 80 grit) and work your way threw the different grits until you get to a 220 grit. You should probably use a pre-stain conditioner which will ensure a more even stain. If you choose not to use a conditioner, wipe the table with a damp rag 10-15 mins before you apply the stain: this will open up the wood to better take the stain. Don't use a stain that already has poly in it. Use a separate stain and then poly. Also, read the directions for recoating times. Often, they are different by brand and are important to follow. Refinishing a table will take a few days but will be worth it.  If your scratches are deep enough to need to be filled, make sure you choose a stain-able wood filler. My favorite is plasti-wood. Which comes in different colors but I always use 'natural' when I will be staining. If you do use plasti-wood brand, do not get it on your skin, it contains acetone and will burn. A basic wood filler like Elmer's will work and will not cost as much, just be sure it says it is stainable not just paintable. Fill the scratches and allow it to dry before you start sanding to avoid doing twice the amount of sanding time and using double the paper. You have a lot of sanding time ahead of you, you definitely don't want to double the time. Oh, and this is just a tip from experience, please wear a mask when sanding, I used to always get really bad stuffy noses and sinus infections after every project until I finally realized that it always happened after something needed a lot of sanding. I wish someone had told me. ☺ Good luck with everything and we expect pictures when you are done."

My orbital sander definitely won't be able to properly sand the curved edges. I'm guessing that I'll be sanding the sides and corners by hand..."
woodworking,3du4h9,litlluvbug,2,Sun Jul 19 16:07:24 2015 UTC,"I just use a basic dust mask and it helps tons. Like this one  https://stanleypersonalprotection.com/products/Nuisance%20Disposable%20Dust%20Mask/Nuisance_Disposable_Dust_Ma-large.jpg  With all the little crevices, that is all hand sanding. Get sanding sponges with an angled side to get it the tight spots and don't be afraid to use the old standard method of folding basic sanding paper to get in the super tiny spots. With a project like this table, most of your refinishing time is the sanding and waiting on stuff to dry. :) I feel I should also mention that whether you use pre-stain conditioner or not, you should wipe down the whole table with a damp cloth or tack cloth to get rid of all the sanding dust, before you start staining. All the hard work you do to get it smooth will be a waste if your stain and poly ends up bumpy from sanding dust 😉"

woodworking,3du2jd,UkTapes,2,Sun Jul 19 13:55:38 2015 UTC,"I think the hardest thing would be to keep cross sectional cuts of green wood from checking and splitting.  Driftwood doesn't have this problem because it is already seasoned.  I think you'd do best if you cut dead trees (preferably softwood) that are still standing.  Green wood would require careful aging.  One method would be to cut your slabs and wrap each of them in two plastic garbage bags, opening the bags for a few minutes every day to let them dry out very gradually.  Once the wood is dry and stable you should have no problem painting on the surface.  But it will take patience.  I've got a slab of apple wood seasoning this way now — it was cut in the spring and still has a long way to go but it hasn't checked."
woodworking,3du2jd,gargle_ground_glass,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:00:24 2015 UTC,"For a slice of wood roughly 1-2cm thick, do you think it would take equally long to age? And is there a fast-track way of getting there or is this likely a quite long term project."
woodworking,3du2jd,gargle_ground_glass,3,Sun Jul 19 15:29:49 2015 UTC,"That's a tough call.  A piece that thin would dry more quickly and there would likely be less radial and tangential stress, which might limit the potential checking and splitting.  I think a little experimentation might be a good idea.  Try coating each side with a clear water-based sealer.  This would slow up the drying process a bit — which you want — but I'm guessing we're still talking months.    I just checked the piece of apple wood that I mentioned — it's about 2 - 3 cm thick and unfinished.  Cut in March, it's reached 32% moisture, but I've left it unopened for days at a time.  There are liquid solutions you can soak your wood in which promote even drying with minimal checking but I don't know what effect they might have on paintability."
woodworking,3du2jd,Couchtiger23,2,Sun Jul 19 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"Apply some sizing to it before you paint and you should be fine. Size both sides equally so that the wood doesn't warp.

I do not have the time or skill to learn how to set the plane properly. Repeatedly striking the thing, constantly having to correct my mistakes etcetera. Storing it wrong and it might warp. On the other hand, I DO know how metal works and what kind of precision and repeatability you can achieve with a properly machined tool. I assume/suspect that I will have an easier time using a metal tool that is set with leavers and screws/threads."

woodworking,3dsxkg,KappnDingDong,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:54:53 2015 UTC,"Except you're facing the same dilemma with metal planes, which gradually warp with temperature and pressure.  A wooden plane made from a higher quality wood will exhibit minimal warping and movement if made properly.  Just the act of pushing a metal plane across wood will bow the sole.  You're applying pressure to the knob and tote and adding heat from friction.  Metal planes have nothing to lock leavers and screws in place once set.  You will be spending just as much time adjusting a metal plane during use as you will a wooden variant.  And depending on how recently you oiled your plane and how cold it is in your shop, you could be in for an annoying few hours.  Adjusting the cap iron and chip breaker is faster in a wooden plane.  But I guess it's your time that is being spent, so to each his own.  But it just fascinates me how often I hear engineers talk greatly about their chosen profession and then fail to catch on to simple, easily understood concepts like a wooden plane."

I'm a mechanical engineer by trade, so wedging things and hammering stuff into an approximate position goes against everything I've ever learned.    I understand where you're coming from but adjusting woodies is not as approximate as you think, or at least it's not more approximate than with most metal planes. With a no. 4 clone it's well known that there is 'slop' in the adjustment wheel to live with (while with a woodie the adjustments for blade projection are very immediate) and you can't just turn it the perfect amount and get the blade projection just right. You have to turn the wheel, judge the blade projection by eye and then test it on the wood, adjust again if needed etc.   Also the lateral adjustment lever on Stanley clones can have a lot of play in them too (remember, 19th century technology) but with woodies you just tap sideways gently. With practice you get extremely good at doing these adjustments.  Quite frankly, with practice you could adjust a wooden plane nearly as fast as a metal plane, and certainly just as accurately (it not they'd never have been usable).   Also I just can't imagine having tools that work differently depending on moisture.   You may have an exaggerated idea of how pronounced this is; part of the design of good ones (i.e. the ideal grain orientation) is they respond to moisture very little.   In use, many users never notice the effect."

I should have tacked this on yesterday, if the secondhand market doesn't exist in Germany had you not thought about buying new from Amazon.de?   I just checked to make sure their stock is similar to the UK Amazon and they have numerous Putzhobel available, including the Faithfull no. 4 and I think I'm reading it right and it qualifies for free shipping.   Obviously it has one very bad review but I think you'll realise reading it that the buyer had an unrealistic expectation of what a plane at this price should be like. All cheaper planes require some work before they're in full working order, at the very least it should be expected that the iron will need to be fully sharpened and the leading edge of the cap iron will need to be fettled (worked on, refined).   That's exactly what I needed to do to mine to get it into working condition and it only took about half an hour."

It is the 8mm bolts that secure the cutter knives in the cutter head.  They are in a slot that is about 10 mm wide and I can not get to them from the end so the impact driver is out of the question.  I did use an 8mm wrench and a 12 inch piece of pipe to get four out of the 15 or so loose.    I sent an email to Byrd regarding the specific model hopefully they get back to me early in the week.

Take whatever might be left over on the card and build a nice outfeed table/work bench for the saw with storage underneath for hand tools. You can use your miter gauge for cross cuts and miters and find a cheap smoothing plane or two for thicknessing.

There's a lot of different ways to do woodworking and we just need to know the route you want to take to better assist you."
woodworking,3dt8ci,Drewology,3,Sun Jul 19 11:53:19 2015 UTC,"I think a priority for you would be a decent panel saw with impulse-hardened teeth and backsaw of some kind, maybe in a mitre box since you're sure to want to cut some mitres doing small projects. I don't how much of a selection of hand tools there is in HD but I'd also suggest you get a pull saw so you can compare with Western-style saws and see if you have a preference.  If you want to get a major power tool I'd go with bandsaw over a table saw all day every day. Numerous previous threads where the same opinion is voiced, basically all saying the same thing: a bandsaw if far more versatile than a table saw.  Even if you get a bandsaw you'll want at least one of the hand saws as well, since there are still cuts you'll want to do, or have to do, by hand.  Have chisels? If not you need some. If you buy chisels you'll need some sharpening equipment which you might not be able to get at HD.  Do they stock hand planes? You could do with at least one of those too. If you want to start basic I'd suggest getting a low-angle block plane."

woodworking,3dt8ci,commodore_nate,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:07:34 2015 UTC,"/u/blaineT has some great advice. If you are going to use pallet wood, the planer is probably the best choice because you are going to need to get all the fuzz and dirt off of those boards.   If you decide to use any type of surfaced stock (think the hardwood section at home depot), then I would opt for the RS4512 table saw over a lunchbox planer. When planing stock to thickness or removing a lot of surface fuzziness isn't a priority, the versatility of a table saw will make it much more valuable.  I would only add a random orbital sander, then a shop vac if you don't have one, and finally a kreg jig and pocket hole screws. If you decide to only get a circular saw instead of a table saw, there's a kreg starter pack with a kreg jig and a clamp-on fence, which will be useful for keeping long cuts straight."

I started with a basic starters kit that sufficed until I had experience with each gouge and the cut they produced. It would be a good idea to learn how to keep these tools sharp also, and to know what types of timber are suitable. For a beginner, I would recommend Lime Wood, or Basswood in the US.

woodworking,3dryey,jakeygrange,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:51:01 2015 UTC,"I hate sounding negative, but...  There's a more than likely chance the lumber is worthless. Storm damaged trees are very rarely ever worth salvaging as lumber, and many mills won't buy them (I've tried). The twisting and bending forces that eventually felled the tree also typically wreak havoc on the fibrous structure of the wood, which will result in unseen flaws. Most storm damaged wood warps badly during drying from unseen cracks, is structurally questionable, and often unsuitable for lumber.  All that negative aside, there's a good chance that it's still worth something as turning blanks if you have a lathe."
woodworking,3dryey,Silound,4,Sat Jul 18 23:49:21 2015 UTC,"That might be true for selling lumner, but if you mill it much larger than you need, there's a good chance that you can make a keepsake from an entire tree.  Even if you get half as much wood due to waste from processing out twists and cupping, you'd have enough to make something.  The key is the sentimental factor.  What might not be worth the effort if you were buying, could easily be worth the effort to be able to say a piece was made from a specific tree."

woodworking,3drplc,ContraPositivo,2,Sat Jul 18 20:31:43 2015 UTC,If the room I'd only conditioned when it's being used that will slowly be destroyed.  I cant imagine tha its actually solid mahogany. more than likely its torsion box with veneer. So if it's built that way and still warping be happy its only uplifted a little. That room needs to undergo less drastic swings in climate if you or the owners want it to last. If it is solid i would use clamps to slowly pull it back and holp for the best and again it needs not undergo a lot of temp humidity changes.
woodworking,3drplc,joshua721,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:25:39 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for your reply. I believe the temperature changes are damaging it. It is solid mahogany with a treated pine structure.  Would it be possible to fix it without taking it apart? The contractor suggested a type of clamp made of metal rods screwed underneath the table, I'm not sure if it will work.  Thanks again."
woodworking,3drplc,joshua721,2,Sun Jul 19 01:42:43 2015 UTC,It could at first.  That table should not have been built from solid wood. Until it stops undergoing swings in temp you are constantly going to have problems. And even then it may still have problems due to the construction methods.

woodworking,3drplc,issius,0,Sat Jul 18 20:37:04 2015 UTC,"Tell him to keep his shitty employees from wedging their swivel chairs under the table ends.    Your obviously concerned so you must of shed some blood and sweat on the project.   I never work the front desk type jobs so I can't say the reasons but this ""customer is always right"" bullshit is getting out of hand.  I rebuilt  a shed 4 times last month a couple wanted with customizations for AC install, double panes windows were requested after the walls were up finished, then they decided to insulate everything including the floor ... Which was fit sooo sweet the first time. I amazed myself on the perfect fit I did. Un -willing to purchase new supplies for the requested customizing so I didn't have to piece together scraps for a week it became clear the main issue was unrelated to quality or the job but more so about their own personal financial issues and life disagreements,  so it costed me a lot of wasted time and driving and stress.  I ended up walking away from that project.  Rightfully so, but I still feel weird and unsettled about it.   Go fix the desk and make his dumbass happy, even if you have to tear the whole thing apart you'll feel better with him satisfied. Trust me."
woodworking,3dr6vr,damawn,5,Sat Jul 18 17:51:01 2015 UTC,"It's less the fact that the pine is bringing out the orange color of the shellac, and more that the shellac is bringing out the warm orange tones of the pine. Pine naturally yellows quite a bit both from finish and from uv exposure, and the best way to prevent this would have been to start with a uv blocking finish.  That said, you can definitely add some color at this point. I would not recommend adding stain to your own poly, but rather getting a premix, just for consistency. Something like this: http://www.minwax.com/wood-products/one-step-stain-and-finishes/minwax-polyshades  On the plus side, it should take color very evenly due to the coats of finish already applied!"
woodworking,3dr6vr,jellywerker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:32:57 2015 UTC,Great! This way I won't have to mix it myself!
woodworking,3dr6vr,MagillaGorillasHat,2,Sat Jul 18 23:40:49 2015 UTC,"Polyshades is...not a very good product. I would strongly, strongly recommend testing anything you plan to use in an out of the way place."

woodworking,3dr6vr,NosillaWilla,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:12:08 2015 UTC,"I bought a can earlier today, going to test it out tomorrow."
woodworking,3dr6vr,MagillaGorillasHat,2,Mon Jul 20 08:04:52 2015 UTC,"I think it looks great like that. If you stopped at the shellac, you could have fixed it by wiping I off with denatured alcohol. But since you coated it in poly you're now going to have a lot of problems getting the finish off. I'd just leave it as is. Pine is a boring light color as it is and no matter what finish you put youre gonna yellow it. Shellac is about as neutral of a color you can put on. Polyurethane would turn it an even darker color because it has boiled linseed oil in it."
woodworking,3dr6vr,NosillaWilla,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:24:55 2015 UTC,"Polyurethane is a synthetic.    You're probably thinking of danish oil which generally contains poly, BLO, and mineral spirits."
woodworking,3dr6vr,PalafoxSt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:14:18 2015 UTC,Oil based polyurethane has oil in it. Most commonly BLO

woodworking,3dr6vr,Graphus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:02:35 2015 UTC,Thanks. It is much more vibrantly ORANGE than the picture shows though.
woodworking,3dr6vr,bubucisyes,2,Sat Jul 18 23:41:12 2015 UTC,"I also think this looks pretty nice as it is.  But you can use a coloured varnish over the top if you like, that's totally doable. Gel stain is thickened coloured varnish so you can use that if you that's all you can easily find.   I wouldn't recommend you add pigment to your varnish, that will make it coloured but in an opaque way that you're probably not really intending.  For next time you might want to simplify your finishing routine, there's nothing really to be gained using a lot of shellac under poly. Shellac should be used as part of a multi-finish routine only where it provides something specific or solves a problem.    For future reference, shellac comes in a range of colours. From the palest light straw colour of ""super blonde"" shellac through to more obvious yellows to shades of amber to deep red-browns and on to a sort of chocolate shade."
