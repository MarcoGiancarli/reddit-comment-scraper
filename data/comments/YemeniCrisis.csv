YemeniCrisis,3e0q0s,Butt-Pain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"Salman fishing in the Yemen By: Bill Law Date of publication: 17 July, 2015 Comment: With the Saudi-led war in Yemen dragging on longer than expected, Saudi royals are beginning to tire of the civilian casualties and on-off ceasefires, writes Bill Law. As the Saudi-led aerial war against Yemen's Houthis drags on, with civilian casualties mounting and another ceasefire already broken by both sides, frustrations are reportedly growing in the Saudi capital, Riyadh.  Senior princes in the House of Saud are said to be questioning the wisdom of the bombing campaign, launched in March with such enthusiasm by King Salman's favoured son, Mohammed bin Salman.  The intention of the campaign was to break the back of the Houthi revolt and to re-establish the presidency of Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. The Saudi-backed Hadi had rather ignominiously fled by boat, as rebel forces - who had already chased him from the capital, Sanaa - closed in on the southern port city of Aden.  The campaign was also a bold bid by Mohammed bin Salman, or MbS as he is known, to burnish his credentials.  He represents the new breed of Gulf princes, leading aggressively from the front - and not particularly bothered by what allies in the West may think.  His appointment as deputy crown prince in January had already ruffled a few feathers within the ruling family. Then he was announced as defence minister, the world's youngest at 28 (or 32, estimates vary). What better way to enhance his reputation than to administer a sharp, succinct defeat to the Houthis?  Not according to plan  Four months in, the Houthis remain defiantly in place, still in control of Sanaa. True, a pushback begun on 15 July by Saudi-trained forces loyal to Hadi has secured much of Aden, including the airport.  If those troops are able to hold and expand their ground, the stalemate may be broken and the pressure on the Saudis will ease.  Nonetheless, the Houthis have proven to be a tough and wily fighting force. They have already engaged in several border skirmishes with Saudi forces, an uncomfortable reminder to the House of Saud of a disastrous 2009 campaign - one that ended only when Saudi Arabia paid the Houthis a substantial amount of money to withdraw from territory they had seized inside the kingdom.             Senior princes in the House of Saud are said to be questioning the wisdom of the bombing campaign  With still no end in sight and no apparent exit strategy, well placed sources have told al-Araby that very senior princes are frustrated and angry with MbS - referring to him privately as ""the boy"" or ""the teenager"".  He is seen as headstrong, overly ambitious, arrogant and ""out of control"". But they are wary. They need to be - the young prince wields enormous power.  Family fortunes  Among those said to be upset with MbS are some of the surviving sons of Abdulaziz, the founder of the kingdom.  They were passed over when Salman came to power and appointed the powerful interior minister Mohammed bin Nayef crown prince and his son deputy crown prince.  Significantly in a country where appearances count, at least six of the sons of Abdulaziz did not make walaa, that is to pledge allegiance, to MbS when he was installed as deputy crown prince.  Now, my sources say, two of those sons - Ahmed, born in 1942, and Talal, born in 1931 - are among some of MbS' harshest critics, albeit in private.  Someone else who was passed over is Miteb, the son of the late King Abdullah. He is the commander of the 100,000-strong Saudi National Guard, a force whose first allegiance is to the ruling family.  Miteb, disgruntled though he may be, is unlikely to use the national guard as a kingmaker unless the position of Mohammed bin Salman becomes very precarious.  Is that likely to happen? The sources have told me that what they called ""serious discussions"" between some of the senior princes are already taking place. Concerns about the nuclear deal with Iran has further exacerbated their anxiety.  Geopolitical games  A lifting of sanctions means Iran can sell its oil openly on the world market. Some of the proceeds, the princes fear, will go toward rearming the Houthis, thus prolonging the war and potentially threatening the kingdom directly.  One possible scenario would see MbS being forced to step down as defence minister if his Yemen adventure threatens a Saudi humiliation. That may be a long time coming, though, if at all.  Saudi Arabia remains steadfast in its belief that it can bomb the Houthis to the negotiation table and remain defiant in the face of international concern at the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Yemen.  Observing all of this is Mohammed bin Nayef (MbN). A source with contacts in the interior ministry told me that MbN is paying the price for throwing in his lot with Mohammed bin Salman in order to secure the choice post of crown prince.             There is a possibility that a palace coup may occur, one that would depose the ailing king  ""His uncles [Ahmed and Talal] won't help him. He burnt his bridges with them,"" the source said.  He added that Mohammed bin Nayef was ""keeping his head down and trying to avoid irritating Mohammed bin Salman"". The prize at stake for both men is the throne itself.  MbN's only hope, the source claimed, is that King Salman, who is reportedly suffering from dementia, will die soon - thus enabling him to become king, while Mohammed bin Salman is hampered by the war in Yemen.  However, King Salman reportedly remains in robust physical health.  The plot thickens  Of course, the insecurities and behind-the-scenes feuding in the House of Saud reflect a larger anxiety about regional instability and the growing strength of Iran.  Should those insecurities continue to rise, the source told me, there is a possibility that a palace coup may occur, one that would depose the ailing king, force out both Mohammeds and install a surviving but competent son of the founding king as a caretaker - while a new order is sorted out.  It is fair to say that similar stories of palace intrigue have swirled for decades around the near impenetrable court of a ruling family whose demise was first predicted more than 50 years ago and has yet to happen.  And removing the king and his two most powerful princes would be a very extreme step indeed.  But what gives the reports of serious family rifts some credence is the war in Yemen, which has thus far only served to create grave instability on the kingdom's doorstep.  And while the Saudis and their allies are busy attacking the Houthis, al-Qaeda grows in strength in the south of Yemen.  Meanwhile, the so-called Islamic State group is a constant existential threat, thriving in the chaos that now defines much of the Middle East.  Never before has the kingdom found itself simultaneously facing two such enemies. With the Saudis fixating on the bombing campaign, neither is being effectively confronted.  The people of Yemen, in the meantime, caught between the Houthis on the ground and the Saudis and their allies in the air are in the middle of what the UN has called a ""massive humanitarian crisis"" that has left more than 1,500 civilians dead, 3,600 injured and one million displaced.  That is the appalling price ordinary Yemenis are being forced to pay, as Saudi princes play out their extraordinary political games in Riyadh.  Bill Law is a former BBC Gulf analyst.

Instead, they've been destroying the Houthi's more powerful weapons through air strikes, and providing what appears to be ad hoc training and equipment to whomever fights the Houthis (except AQAP), even if those militias (like al-Hirak) don't care for Hadi much themselves.  It seems like the whole thing was more about MbS than the Houthis, insofar as the young Defense Minister seized an emerging crisis to prove himself and solidify his position, rather than the Saudi government implementing the policy after deliberation and goal-oriented careful planning with a specific objective in mind."

Given Obama's statements that he'd appreciate the Arabs taking some collective responsibility for regional security, and that lack of enthusiasm for the best means of doing so in decades belies an unfamiliarity, that the coalition isn't what he meant by that.   But once it started, the US had no real alternative to backing it. All its regional allies were involved, and the US wasn't going to denounce operations against the Houthis. The only real response is backing it in the hopes that the US could steer it towards something it preferred."

It is estimated that current budget needs $100+/barrrel to break even, which is not going to happen in near future. And if Iran joins the market, then it will happen never.  Another big news floating around is that Egypt may soon announce a big shift in their Yemen Policy. I think they realize that spending intelligent and effort on Houth's, which was never a threat to Egypt is a valuable waste of resource especially when AQAP is getting emboldened and IS has raised it's head and Egypt is plagued by IS/AQ in Sinai where recently dozens of soldiers were blown up and a spectacular missile was launched to hit Egyptian destroyer many miles into the sea!"

This is because:   very generous government subsidies reduced incentive to earn a living literally most of the labor force is foreign and natives work cushy, useless government jobs educational system is too focused on religion, not enough on technical matters (they are trying to change this to their credit) so they lag behind less wealthy countries in skilled labor"
YemeniCrisis,3e0q0s,borhas,3,Tue Jul 21 18:24:43 2015 UTC,"Okay you unlike the other guy you decided to engage in a debate in a civilized manner, and I commend you for it, for that I will happily debate each of your points individually.   1- Yes we do have very generous government subsidies, it is not a bad thing, it improves the quality of life of the nation and its citizens and it is what is expected from the government as a wealthy government to do. Other Oil wealthy government such as Norway also has a very generous government subsidies program, there is nothing wrong with it.   2- That is changing rapidly, very very rapidly. While what you said might have been true 10 years ago, today one third of the private market labour force is Saudi nationals, as the education push by the late King Abdullah is starting to bare fruit now. The new Labour laws increased the number of Saudi employees drastically, which before companies preferred the foreign labour due to lower salaries and benefits than the ones they would be given to Saudi nationals. There are many articles on this you can research on your own, your view regarding this matter is very outdated.   3- The educational system has taken leaps and bounds in previous years. We currently have the highest research rate in the Arab world, over taking Egypt 2 years ago, and still increasing in a rate of 113% per year, which is the highest in the world. I personally am also a researcher and have released 2 papers to my name in the field of medicine.  http://www.kacst.edu.sa/en/about/media/news/Pages/486.aspx  Look at this list: http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?area=0&category=0&region=Middle+East&year=2014&order=it&min=0&min_type=it  We are close to overtaking Israel in terms of yearly research output, and only behind in Israel in citation per document and impact in the whole region which should give you an idea.   Skilled labour such as doctors and Engineers are being filled very fast by Saudi nationals. 10 years ago a Saudi doctor was something very rare to see, now it is like the flood gates has opened, I am one of those Educated in KSA in the field of medicine and is an active research participant in my field and continue to do so.

For example, fuel subsidies are horribly wasteful.  They encourage people to be wasteful.  Saudi Arabia will probably change this particular subsidy like Iran did. One third of the labor force being Saudi nationals is ridiculously low compared to any other country in the world. The only exceptions would be the other rich Gulf countries.  In fact, I thought it was closer to half than a third, so I think I was actually being overly generous rather than outdated.  Yes, that is impressive, especially compared to other gulf countries."

The state's main job is increasing the quality of life of its citizens. That should always be any government's goal in the world, YES our quality of life could be a lot better due to some archaic laws, but if we take these laws out we will be literally like a Scandinavian country in terms of everything. But I gave up trying to compare ourselves and faced the reality that we should compare ourselves to the region around us, and regionally speaking, we are doing very very fine of ourselves.   I'd still give us time though, 20-30 years down the road and we will be a beacon of science and Industry not just regionally speaking but all over the world.

YemeniCrisis,3e1sed,Butt-Pain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:15:11 2015 UTC,"ميساء شجاع الدين   17 20 يوليو 2015 التحول العسكري الكبير لصالح قوات المقاومة، ضد مليشيا الحوثي في عدن، يعد بتطورات سياسية إيجابية كثيرة لو استكمل مهامه العسكرية من خلال تصفية عدن ومحيطها، محافظتي لحج وأبين، ونجح في إسقاط قاعدة العند العسكرية، فيما عدا ذلك فهو نصر عسكري هش، قد يتعرض لانتكاسة كبيرة. منذ إنجاز الحوثي كارثة إسقاط الدولة اليمنية، تحولت اليمن إلى مساحة جغرافية، وكأي مساحة جغرافية بلا دولة، صار اليمنيون يفتقدون صفة الشعب، وتحولوا إلى قبائل ومناطق وطوائف، ما يفسر حالة الحرب الأهلية التي دخلتها في بلد بلا مرجعية سياسية ودستورية. لذا، من الطبيعي أن يسمى نصر المقاومة باسم المكان وليس الجماعة، ويكون انتصار عدن، وربما اليمن لو تجاوزنا الجغرافيا، بينما انتصارات الحوثي هي انتصارات جماعة سلطوية متطرفة ضد بقية اليمنيين. التعامل مع نصر عدن قد يجعله نصراً جغرافياً يتجاور مع انتصارات جغرافية أخرى للحوثي. لكن، لن يهزمه، وقد يكون هذا النصر فاتحة مهمة في طريق استعادة الدولة اليمنية. هذا يعتمد على سلوك الفاعلين السياسيين تجاه هذه التطورات العسكرية. عندما سقطت العاصمة اليمنية صنعاء، في سبتمبر/أيلول الماضي، ابتهج بعض الجنوبيين، وتوهم أنها خطوة في طريق استعادة دولة الجنوب، وكأن ما يجري في الشمال يتوقف عند الشمال فقط. هذا التفكير القاصر والجاهل بأبسط مبادئ الجغرافيا والتاريخ تبنته قيادات سياسية، يطمح بعضها إلى تأسيس دولة، على الرغم من أن نظرة بسيطة للخريطة، أو للتاريخ اليمني، كافية ليعلم السياسي المتهافت، أنه لم يحدث، يوماً، أن جرى أمر جلل في الشمال، ولم تكن له تداعيات في الجنوب، والعكس صحيح، وهذا ليس مرتبطاً، بالضرورة، بوحدة الكيان السياسي اليمني أم تقسيمه. بطبيعة الحال، امتد الحوثيون إلى الجنوب اليمني، وطال زلزال الشمال الجنوب تدميراً وعبثاً، بل وأخذ الجنوب، حتى الآن، النصيب الأكبر. ولا تتعلق المسألة بهروب الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي إلى الجنوب في عدن، ولا بالدولة اليمنية الموحدة التي أعطت لجائحة الحوثي القدرة على التمدد جنوباً، بل تتعلق بحقيقة أن انهيار الدولة والفراغ السياسي ضمن المشروع الغربي لعرقنة المنطقة أغرى الحوثي بالتمدد. هذا النصر العسكري المتزامن مع توقيع الاتفاق النووي، وبعد أيام من الإنزال البري لقوات يمنية، تم تدريبها وتنظيمها، نجحت في إحداث هذا الفارق العسكري، في وقت وصل فيه الحوثيون إلى درجة عالية من الإنهاك، جاء متزامناً، أيضاً، مصادفة مع حدث كاشف، هو حوار خالد بحاح نائب رئيس الجمهورية، وربما خليفته، مع قناة ""بي بي سي"" العربية. وهو يستدعي الاهتمام، لأنه يجري مع الرجل الذي يتم إعداده ليحل محل الرئيس هادي، والحكومة المنفية في الرياض لا تكتسب أهميتها لشرعيتها المهتزة. لكن، بحكم أنها آخر ما تبقى من ملامح الدولة اليمنية، ومن دونها نجد صعوبة كبيرة في إيجاد مرجعية بديلة، يمكن البدء بها ضمن واقع سياسي شديد التعقيد والصعوبة. ""لو كان الهدف هو تحرير عدن كجغرافيا من الحوثي، فالنتيجة تعني جغرافيات متصارعة، تنتصر لمشروع عرقنة اليمن، وتحويله إلى مساحة صراع جغرافي، واليمنيون مجرد بيادق لهذا الصراع، لا مستقبل لهم ولا إرادة""  الأهم من هذا حديث بحاح الكاشف لبعض مكنونات الرجل التكنوقراطي، وليس السياسي، وقد تحدث بصراحة عن خيار الانفصال حلاً محتملاً. وهذا كلام يكشف تهافت الرئيس المحتمل، فهو في حوار لقناة عربية بصفته نائب للرئيس الشرعي، شرعيته مستمدة من أنه يمثل الدولة اليمنية الموحدة، وليس بصفته قيادياً من الحراك الجنوبي. ومن جهة أخرى، يكشف عن طبيعة الرجل المناطقية الانفصالية الحضرمية (وليس فقط جنوبية) الواضحة من اختياره طاقم عمله. ربما شعر خالد بحاح بأنه محتاج لمداعبة مشاعر الشارع الجنوبي، الغاضب والمحتقن من الشمال، بشكل غير مسبوق، وهذا مفهوم بعد تعرضه لهجمة شرسة من جماعة جهوية مناطقية- مذهبية، لكن هذا فضلاً عن أنه خطأ ينافي ببساطة طبيعة دوره ممثلاً شرعياً للحكومة اليمنية، فهو، أيضاً، فيه قدر واضح من الرياء والنفاق الذي تميل له قيادات جنوبية كثيرة، عندما تحاول تصوير الانفصال حلاً مطروحاً، على الرغم من علمها أنه مستبعد إقليميا ودولياً، فالخيار الذي تتبناه الدول الفاعلة في اليمن خيار التقسيم الفيدرالي لليمن، وليس الكونفدرالي، ولا الانفصال لمجموعة دول ضعيفة فقيرة، لا تملك مقومات البقاء. ولن يوقف الانفصال صراعات اليمنيين بين الشمال والجنوب، أو بين الجنوب والجنوب، أو بين الشمال والشمال، وبالنسبة للمجتمع الدولي التعامل معها كصراعات محلية أسهل وأوفر من التعامل معها باعتبارها صراعات بين دول فقيرة لا تهدأ. ينظر العالم إلى اليمن كمساحة جغرافيا تسكنها مجموعة قبائل وطوائف مسلحة، قيمة الجغرافيا في اليمن تعلو الإنسان، ومنظورهم لليمن، سواء كانت إيران أو السعودية أو الغرب، ينطلق من موقعها جنوب أكبر مصدر بترول في العالم، وبلد الأراضي المقدسة لأكثر من مليار مسلم. ينتصر الحوثي وبحاح لهذا التعريف، عندما ينتصرون للجغرافيا وليس للإنسان اليمني، وتطلعاته التي عبرت عنها ثوراته وانتفاضاته، منذ منتصف القرن الماضي، وآخرها ثورة 2011، فالتعامل مع الجغرافيا من دون مراعاة مسار التاريخ ورؤى المستقبل يعني إلغاء دور الفاعل البشري وهو الشعب اليمني. ليست معالجة جراح الجنوب بمداعبة مشاعره المشحونة بالبغض تجاه جماعة معتدية من الشمال، بل بمصارحته بالواقع الصعب والوعي باستحقاقات المستقبل، حتى لا يبقى اليمنيون أسرى مشاعر الغضب والكراهية، من دون قدرة على المضي قدماً. أبناء عدن هم أولى بمدينتهم، وليس من حق الحوثي الذي لا يمتلك شرعية دولة، ولا يمتلك حق وصاية عليهم للدفاع عنهم، وهذا أمر لا مراء فيه، ما يعطي أبناء عدن الحق والشرعية في الدفاع عن أنفسهم ضد الحوثي، لكن حدود عدن لا تقف عند عدن، بل تمتد إلى بقية الجنوب، وحماية الجنوب لا يمكن أن تكون من دون تأمين الشمال. ومن السذاجة تصور أن شمالاً حوثياً سوف يكون معزولاً، وغير مؤثر على الجنوب، فهو يعني دخول اليمن دائرة الاستقطاب الإقليمي – الطائفي، ما سينجم عنه جنوب داعشي. الحل هنا هو الانتصار للدولة اليمنية، وما تبقى من ظلالها من سلطة وجيش، كمرجعية انطلاق سياسي ضد الحوثي، لكن مواجهة الحوثي، بأدواته المناطقية القاصرة، وبذات سلوكه المليشياوي المنفلت من أي قيمة إنسانية، سوى قيمة القوة، لن يسفر عنه نصر حقيقي، بل نصر جغرافي قاصر وهش ومهتز، وليس هناك هزيمة أعظم من هزيمة تحول صاحب الحق لمرآة مشوهة لخصمه. قد يتحول الإنجاز العسكري على الأرض إلى نصر سياسي، لو تم التعامل مع تداعياته بوعي، فلو كان الهدف هو تحرير عدن كجغرافيا من الحوثي، فالنتيجة تعني جغرافيات متصارعة، تنتصر لمشروع عرقنة اليمن، وتحويله إلى مساحة صراع جغرافي، واليمنيون مجرد بيادق لهذا الصراع، لا مستقبل لهم ولا إرادة. ولو الهدف استعادة مشروع بناء دولة يمنية حديثة، فعلى النخبة السياسية اليمنية البائسة التوقف عن تصدير أوهامها، والتعامل بوعي أكثر ومسؤولية بعيدة عن الخفة والتهافت، وهما صفتان لصيقتان بالسياسي اليمني، لأنه أسير الجغرافيا، وليس رجل دولة مهموم بصدق في شأن المواطن اليمني."

YemeniCrisis,3dtpbq,Random10187,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:16:21 2015 UTC,The best way to understand the Yemen crisis is to compare it to Afghanistan the geography is the same and the fighting factions use the same tactics the Houthis rely heavily on the Taliban caves and mountains strategy the Arab coalition still using US NATO bombings the next step has to be a ground invasion.  The only difference I would say is that the Saudis are more popular in Yemen than the US in Afghanistan so that will speed things a little its not gonna take a decade but a few years.

YemeniCrisis,3dpdh8,omarshamshoon1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:08:14 2015 UTC,Is Hathrmoat the sparse quarter really the wealthiest part of Yemen?  It's like another country all to itself.
YemeniCrisis,3dpdh8,wolflarsen,3,Sat Jul 18 06:00:52 2015 UTC,It is the wealthiest. It actually could be its own country if it wanted to. They have enough resources to become the coolest shit. Saudi would love to get Hadramout as a part of it and they've been trying very hard. I actually don't think that Yemen will ever split into two. Either it splits threeways or doesn't split at all.   From Hadi's last speech it seems to me that Saudi doesn't want Yemen to split yet but it is inevitable.
YemeniCrisis,3dpdh8,Butt-Pain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:43:15 2015 UTC,Of course KSA can't allow a Yemen split. Why would anyone ever think that?  A split means Houthis have their own country and can have int'l relations with Russia & Iran.  This is basically a continuously replenishing non-communicating military thread beneath its borders.  KSA had better plan on gaining favor in the South; raising an army there; and having good relations in order to goad the south into policing and keeping the Houthis in check.  That can happen only as 1 country.   However - yeah I see why Hadthrmoat is like its own country as it is.

It's why I always say the airstrikes are to the advantage of Saleh.
YemeniCrisis,3diogp,Butt-Pain,-1,Fri Jul 17 04:43:59 2015 UTC,the airstrikes are to the advantage of Saleh.   THAT depends on the outcome of the war.
YemeniCrisis,3diogp,fusfusman,5,Sat Jul 18 04:22:05 2015 UTC,"If Saudi had the tiniest bit of respect for Yemen they wouldn't be bombing every single Friday prayer, eid morning and intensifying in Ramadan. It's almost as if they don't ever pray. It only increases the support of people against Saudi.  It's not like they're targeting Saleh. They had many chances but failed to kill they guy. He was chilling in the streets, making speeches while drunk out of his mind for at least a month (if you know Saleh you would know his Vodka voice). His (complicit) relatives chill in the UAE while they bomb their empty houses and kill the innocent neighbors. One of my distant relatives had an entire family die from this.  That makes two of my distant relatives who had entire families killed for no reason. One had their house collapse on them when Attan blew up like crazy and only a little 9 year old girl survived and they other family were neighbors to one of Saleh's empty houses whose residents are chilling in the gulf. I'm one guy from a medium sized family which isn't even part of a tribe. Imagine how many dead relatives the rest of Yemenis have.  Even when the war against the Houthis is done, Saudi will have many people who want blood vengeance for unnecessary death and collective punishment.  These days anyone from Saddaa is blown to shreds just because they are from Saddaa. Even displaced families that ran away from Saddaa are being targeted.  Don't feel bad for me. They were very distant relatives and I only met one of them a very long time ago. I only know them by name. Sorry for ranting and coming off as a bit angry..."
YemeniCrisis,3diogp,Butt-Pain,-1,Sat Jul 18 05:07:43 2015 UTC,"They had many chances but failed to kill they guy.   From what I hear the Saudis meant to hit Saleh's house but the UAE warned him 2 hours before the strike was executed. They seem to be the ones playing games here. It's one thing to house people (at this point Saleh's family is in the horrors of the open air prison of Dubai), but it's another to completely foil a military objective. That's a story that needs to be looked into.   Saudi will have many people who want blood vengeance   That's for sure, but the extent to which is to be seen. For one around 1 million Yemenis (I think) were given corrected migrant status in the Kingdom. Basically the entire Yemeni population in Saudi that had visa complications or came in without a visa were given our version of residency. There're also Yemenis who applied for Saudi citizenship that had met the criteria but couldn't find the official to approve their application. They were also all given Saudi citizenship. Those two categories alone amount to around 1% of Yemen's population, and that would be enough to get a positive feel going giving how fiscal interdependance and social ties work in this part of the globe given the proper investment. Around a good 90% of Yemenis here love King Salman for aiding the resistance, and other Yemenis feel like although more can be done (some actually want a military intervention), they feel like the aid is better than nothing. I frequent Yemeni souks and diners in Riyadh and Jeddah and gather public opinion. A rough number of those interviewed in my informal survey would be around 130-160 people. Shop owners, tailors, passers-by, farmers, tradespeople, students, etc.   I also gather for a fact that a lot of the Hadarma and those from Ta'iz, Aden, and Hodeida are overwhelmingly in support of the airstrikes. As for Saada, I have no idea what's going on there. I've stopped listening to the news on the topic because almost no reporters have visited other than a few pro-Houthi ones. Asides that not even the Yemenis I ask know what's happening there. It's odd that the Houthis themselves would make it off-limits like this.   Sorry for ranting and coming off as a bit angry...   No worries. We all love our countries, and quite frankly your country has a special place in my heart. I understand."
YemeniCrisis,3diogp,fusfusman,3,Sat Jul 18 07:47:44 2015 UTC,"Do you know how long it took them to actually start targeting Saleh's house? Shit was ridiculous!   The corrected Yemeni status barely even makes up for the torture and death Yemenis got in Saudi which I told you about the first time we ever talked. You asked me for sauce that day. I'm not sure if you saw it yet but Human Rights Watch did a thing to show it. I could find it for you if you havnt seen it already.  The Yemenis you talked probably didn't have much of an idea of how the strikes are affecting the country. Sure, they could be right the without the airstrikes it would've been much worse in places like Taiz but the PTSD that the kids get simply from the sounds of the bombings will haunt us for a whole generation.  I'm from Taiz btw and my little cousins there are in terrible conditions. The pee themselves, have nightmares, hide under beds when someone slams a door, etc.  My house and my relatives homes in Taiz got destroyed by Houthis but thankfully only one person got hurt and he'll be alright. My relatives ran away to another relatives home on the outskirts of Taiz before their home was destroyed."
YemeniCrisis,3diogp,Butt-Pain,-1,Sat Jul 18 08:32:22 2015 UTC,"It did take a while for the Saudis to start hunting him down but looking back you can tell the Saudis never expected Saleh to go apeshit nutbags. That guy's gotten the most amazing insecurity complex in history, right after Hitler and his art school   the torture and death Yemenis got in Saudi   Searched it up and found that it was during King Fahd's era. He was our Stalin Lite, in a way. People don't talk about him in detail anymore.   A lot of the Yemenis I met were actually fresh out of Yemen. If they happened to be in KSA when they closed the border they don't deport them back. What does make them grateful is that they can at least earn a living in Saudi and relieve some of the suffering of their loved ones back home. However, you're right, the PTSD is a concerning issue in the long run."

YemeniCrisis,3da3q5,metalmayne,6,Tue Jul 14 18:06:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I guess I'm considered a northerner because the time I've spent in Yemen has almost exclusively been between Sanaa and Ibb, but the people of Sanaa shouldn't not be grouped into the ideologicals of the Sanaa ""elite"". Families are in danger there too, admittedly not to the extent of the people in the south. This isn't just an inconvenience to northerners though, there are legit sufferers.   That being said, I can't deny the fact that Aden should be able to decide its own fate after what has happened. My hope is that the country doesn't get fragmented, because we've seen the bloodshed that comes of it, in the present and in the past."

If anyone’s denying this then they probably just don’t want to give legitimacy to ridiculous Houthi claims about them only fighting al-Qaeda / Daesh, and that “Popular Resistance” is just a new name for al-Qaeda.

Saudis can’t say “they’re violating the truce” if fighting continues in central and southern Yemen (which it would, even if the Houthis were saints Popular Resistance is too unorganized to sign onto a truce) and then begin bombing again. Lack of fighting ensures aid can safely make it through Southern Yemen.   But would I expect them to do that? No way, why would they withdraw when they think they’re winning?

Then you have the population of Yemen, who has been brought down by the shit eating idiots. Most of them are clueless aside from determining which gat from which soug is good this week. They blow their meager wages on bullshit and waste an entire afternoon talking with themselves on what they think is right until the high wears off.   If Yemen splits, I'm officially done. I'm allhamdullah, blessed to be born in the USA. I have spent the majority of my life in Yemen but the stupidity of the crap that happens to Yemen and the Yemeni people, the self inflicted harm and the pettiness of everything has broken my will to even tell anyone I'm Yemeni. My wife and child are stuck there because one guy, Ali Saleh, with all the money in the world, can't drop his ego.   Fuck Yemen."

Syria is more important than Yemen strategically and if the rebels succeeded it will be a big blow for Iran's and Hizbollah's regional ambitions. Also like the article said, Iran's influence in Yemen is minuscule, the real guy they have to negotiate with is Ali Abdullah Saleh. The troops fighting alongside the Houthis are loyal to him and he is the reason the Houthis managed to takeover Sanaa and the rest of Yemen.   As for the Arab Spring, what a disaster that was! All it brought was suffering and instability to the region. I used to think Tunisia was the only country that made it out safely, but after what happened last week, it seems they will have their own challenges to deal with."

Have they been disarmed? You and the Saudi government declare victory when you don't even have it.   The war on Yemen has never offered the promise of victory. The Saudis pledged to halt Houthi expansion beyond Sanaa, and not only has that failed, but the Saudi's southern border has come under Houthi shelling, resulting thus far in ~30 Saudi troop losses. Saudis have nothing tangible to show thus far, besides a purchased coalition, thousands of dead Yemenis, and destroyed infrastructure."

Houthis have already entered other cities before reaching Aden. The real battle is between Saudi and Ali Abdullah Saleh, not the Houthis. Houthis wouldn't have been able to enter Sanaa, let alone advance to Aden without his blessings. Basically they are his scapegoats, canon fodder. Saudi could have taken the easy way out and made a deal with Ali Abdullah Saleh and helped install his son Ahmed, but for some baffling reason chose the hard way which is fighting both Houthis and Saleh. My opinion is that Saudi wants a weak Yemen. the longer they drag this war the more Yemen's infrastructure and military is destroyed. And 30 soldiers compared to how many Yemenis who perished in this war? with zero gains for Houthis' attack on the borders."

YemeniCrisis,3bo1y0,wolflarsen,3,Wed Jul 1 09:56:19 2015 UTC,"Almost right.  The Houthis would most definietly have kept going in the south for a very simple reason : power.    They don't want to rule just Saada + Sanaa.  They want all of Yemen.  And you and I and they and every Yemeni knows the south isn't going to take that laying down.  Especially so close to some how getting away from Saleh rule.  KSA I think entered for simple selfish reasons : ""nope"" to Houthis + SCUDs.  So they pulled a George Bush and tried to preempt them.

From a strategic point of view retreating from Aden would be a disaster, it would allow the pro-Hadi forces to regroup and strike back at the Houthi/Saleh forces, they fought bloodily for every part of Aden and just retreating from it seems like a stupid thing to do considering that they didn't suffer larger defeats and that Hadi troops didn't get bigger reinforcements, I don't believe in this."

YemeniCrisis,3b73qx,hotdogpizzatacoscak2,2,Fri Jun 26 21:18:01 2015 UTC,Bullshit. The Scud was fired and intercepted by a Patriot missile. I think there is a video of that. Saudi intercepted the missile and then the Air Force destroyed the launch pad. The only people who say the attack was successful are the Houthis and their allies. The edit on Wikipedia was probably done by a Houthi supporter or Iranian or whatever. Saudi wouldn't have Israelis on their soil. That is just retarded.

Houthis absolutely would love to launch SCUDs at KSA if they were to rhetorically get their hands on them somehow.    Guess what happened in August 2014?  Exactly, Houthis pulled a slo-mo coup on the government (thanks to Saleh's army not really defending anything).  And once they tried to fully consolidate all power in the land Q1 2015, it was soon apparent that a powder keg is going to be lit and once people realized the military (Saleh's) was enabling the Houthis - all hell broke loose in March 2015.  Enter the Saudis.  They're not here to help southern Yemen and the rest of Yemenis - they're here to help themselves, cuz guess what the Houthis would do with those SCUDs?  Right.  Launch them.

YemeniCrisis,3ajc4h,Butt-Pain,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:26:08 2015 UTC,"Since the first Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen in late March, aimed at dislodging the Zaydi Shiite Houthi movement from the towns and cities they hold across the country, a number of competing and contradictory narratives have emerged.  Who, exactly, is fighting whom? What are their aims? And who is winning on the ground? Thanks to sporadic coverage of the ongoing military offensive and a lack of substantive reporting from the ground, these questions have remained largely unanswered.  Yet several things have become clearer. First, the bombing campaign alone will not allow the Saudis to meet their strategic goals in Yemen against the Houthis, which Riyadh views as a Hezbollah-like Iranian proxy. Second, resistance to the Houthis on the ground is being conducted by a wide array of groups that share few common goals beyond repelling the Houthis from the areas they control. In the vast majority of cases, resistance to the Houthis’ rapid territorial expansion has been driven by perceived threats to local autonomy, fears over the imposition of the Houthis’ sectarian agenda and, in the case of many southern Yemenis, a desire for independence from the north.  Despite Saudi and other regional media outlets’ continued reference to “pro-government forces,” few of these groups are fighting to support Yemen’s president-in-exile, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, around whose technical legitimacy the Saudis have built their campaign. In fact, one of the biggest problems the Saudi-led coalition faces is the extent to which Hadi and his advisers have struggled to build lines of communication with resistance forces, leading Riyadh to lean increasingly on Yemen’s Sunni Islamists, who just a year ago it named members of a terrorist organization.  Since the offensive began, the Houthis, backed by military units loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, have continued to push for control in strategically important territories in the central Yemeni provinces of Mareb and al-Baydah; in the central western areas of Taiz and Ibb; in the southern port town of Aden; and in other southern areas, including the restive city of al-Dhale and the tribal Shabwa and Abyan provinces. Coupled with local resistance, the Saudi campaign has slowed the Houthis’ progress in each area by reducing their ability to move heavy weapons and by preventing them from forming strong supply lines. But the airstrikes have not been enough to prevent the Houthi-Saleh alliance from grinding out victories across the country, while its control over Yemen’s northern highlands has just become more entrenched.  Local groups that the Saudis had expected to form a well-coordinated resistance to the Houthi-Saleh alliance under the umbrella of Hadi’s leadership have instead fared poorly and are reportedly struggling to maintain morale. A number of groups, including the so-called Southern Resistance fighters clustered around Aden who have proven surprisingly resilient in the face of a Houthi onslaught, have repeatedly called for—but not received—better lines of communication from the military command coordinating airstrikes from Riyadh. They also complain of a lack of support from Hadi and his Saudi backers, who they say favor other anti-Houthi fighters, especially those with ties to Islah, Yemen’s main Sunni Islamist party, which had been among the biggest losers from the Houthis’ ascent.  Just last year, Saudi Arabia named Islah a terrorist organization, part of the late Saudi King Abdullah’s efforts to isolate Islamists he saw as having links to the Muslim Brotherhood. But the new Saudi monarch, King Salman, and his reshuffled palace have relaxed their views about working with the Brotherhood, and are said to be willing to rehabilitate Islah and its military allies if it will mean a victory in Yemen. That Islah is now receiving the majority of Saudi support was lent some credence by the prominence of Islah leaders at a conference in Riyadh on Yemen earlier this month.  This has made some members of Hadi’s government-in-exile nervous. They focus on Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, Saleh’s onetime military enforcer and a longtime Islah ally who, along with Islah, split from the Saleh regime during the popular uprising in 2011. One of the Houthis’ greatest rivals during their wars with the government in the mid-to-late 2000s, Mohsen was forced to flee Sanaa after the September 2014 Houthi takeover and is reportedly now advising the Saudis closely in Riyadh. Along with the al-Ahmar family, which helped found Islah in 1990, and Hadi’s own military advisers, Mohsen is believed to have undertaken a huge recruitment campaign to arm and train fighters in Saudi Arabia for an offensive aimed at turning the tide against the Houthis in the coming weeks.  But that has led to concern among the Southern Resistance and pro-southern independence leaders who are also being courted in Riyadh. Some southerners have been given training in Saudi Arabia, but they number only a few hundred compared to the several thousand Mohsen and the al-Ahmars are said to have mustered. Southerners fear that if Islah affiliates are used to beat the Houthis, they will simply form a new regime in the north that enforces unity and continues to marginalize the secessionists.  For the Saudis, it is clear they will have to back Islah if the war is to be won on the ground. Islah is far better organized and armed than Southern Resistance groups, and has a wide support network and experienced military tacticians among its ranks. Yet doing so risks putting the lie to the claim that Riyadh’s intervention is an attempt to restore the country’s legitimate president to his rightful place and complete Yemen’s political transition to democracy, rather than a sectarian war for political primacy in Yemen.  Western officials watching the conflict from the sidelines are worried that their interests in Yemen are rapidly diverging from Riyadh’s. The Saudis have made it clear to them that their primary concern is countering the Houthis and Iran, rather than focusing on al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which has capitalized on Yemen’s unrest. In April, AQAP militants seized control of the strategic port of Mukalla, home to several military bases, and later handed it over to a leadership council largely formed of its local allies.  Without intelligence networks in Yemen, the United States has struggled to define militant targets, despite several drones strikes in the past two months. The Saudis are unlikely to directly lend support to AQAP, but there are legitimate reasons to be concerned that they may bolster the terrorist group, which has presented itself as the only force capable of countering the Houthi threat in Yemen. An unspoken marriage of convenience between an Islamist anti-Houthi coalition and AQAP is by no means impossible.  Most worrying of all is the likelihood that, if the conflict is allowed to drag on, Yemen could descend into a morass like Iraq, Syria and Libya, with multiple armed groups backed by a variety of regional actors vying for control and no clear winner emerging, while diplomacy stalls. After all, preliminary U.N.-led talks scheduled for Thursday have already been postponed, with the chance of meaningful negotiations occurring in the near future looking increasingly unlikely.

They carry out indiscriminate attacks in residential areas   no they don't, This is not how airstrikes are carried out. First intelligence gathers information on various sites weather it is a weapons depot or a militia movement and they send those locations to the air force also the intelligence gathers information on civilians if there is any. The air force job is to determine if the target is worth civilian casualties (again if there is any). They don't bomb away everything just ask any Yemeni from Aden and he'll tell you about the amount of weapons stored underground by the Houthis in residential areas the Saudis know where they are, but they don't bomb them. Why?, because its not worth the civilian deaths.   The biggest war crime was in Saddaa. They gave them a few hours to leave before they bombed everything.   they gave them 24 hours. A 90 year old man on a wheelchair can leave saddaa which is a small city in less than than 24 hours, and the Saudis have all the right in bombing Houthi positions in Saddaa because the rockets that targeted civilians in Najran and Jazan were fired from there.

A Yemeni woman went on stage and threw her shoes at Hamza Al-Houthi who was conducting the press conference. She screamed that they are terrorists and are killing women and children in the south of Yemen. This lead to a fight for a few minutes between a couple of people before security took control.

YemeniCrisis,3a6jkk,Butt-Pain,0,Wed Jun 17 17:58:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that. If you look at their individual tactics separately you'd realize the Houthis approach a scorched earth policy, where if they can't have the land no one can. These are strictly terror tactics that are at play here. They're meant to target not necessarily a faction but an entire society, to paralyze the overall order behind a support base. It's essentially a sort of hostage scenario where the message sent out is ""We'll do this until you either can't live anymore or until you join us"". Asides that, you'd get a disillusioned population that grows frustrated at the lack of security and decides ""If you won't protect us, we'll find someone who will"", so it's effectively a sort of cavity in the morale (ba-dum) of the Houthi's (and others') population that deteriorates security from within. They bomb you, you lose hope in those above, those above have less support for their security services, security weakens, they bomb, etc.  The Saudis on the other hand seem to be taking an odd approach. On the border it looks like they've adopted the love child of the human wave doctrine and guerrilla tactics. They keep withdrawing, giving them another ""wave"", adding to them the advantage of a ""surge"". Then they keep attacking in small-ish groups before attacking, keeping a fair amount of distance between each other. In Yemen itself, they seem to be striking more at the overall logistics of the Houthis, and timing does go into that. If they don't want the Houthis to move, then they sure as hell don't  want them to take advantage of Friday traffic by hiding in the crowd. Looking at where they keep striking makes sense as well. They mainly aim for neighbourhoods that have either large concentrations of the fighters or where the leadership itself resides."
YemeniCrisis,3a6jkk,fusfusman,5,Wed Jun 17 19:09:19 2015 UTC,"The entire second part of your comment is Saudi apologism. In Yemen they have ran out of targets long time ago, they keep striking the same positions over and over again, they also started massively terror bombing Yemeni cities, particularly northern ones like Sada and San'a, hell they even hit a hospital in Taiz, a southern city where Hadi has support and where Houthis are fighting.    They mainly aim for neighbourhoods that have either large concentrations of the fighters or where the leadership itself resides.   Neighbourhoods with big concentration of fighters? What's that supposed to mean, there is no possible way for them to know where are ""high concentrations of fighters"", and even if they knew hitting Houthis in civilian areas where there will be dozens of civilian casualties is unforgivable, seems like you are trying to justify Saudi massive bombing of civilian areas in the north by saying that Saudi missiles hit only their fighters. Saudi air strikes in the north are as bad as Houthi shellings in the south, there are dozens of civilian casualties in the north every day."

No weapon's depots, no C&C centres or HQs, no leadership to target.   there is no possible way for them to know where are ""high concentrations of fighters""   They coordinate with teams on the ground, that's been cleared up within the first 2 weeks of the campaign. Most the strikes are precision and as Amnesty International pointed out, 90% of the deaths in SANAA, which doesn't have significant internal fighting, was caused by the Houthis.   I can't speak for Saada, honestly, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on that one. However, an investigation has yet to be carried out in that area.

Most of his supporters are people with self interests, gangs and of course the man that fought the Houthis for 6 wars and killed Abdulmalik's father is none other than former president  Ali Abdullah Saleh. Saleh has most of the army in his pocket and hes the mastermind behind this recent Houthi movement. Abdulmalik's father (father of the Houthi movement) is probably rolling in his grave out of shame to his son's actions, treason and abandoning the cause. Don't get me wrong, I despise Saudi but this guy has been played like a pawn by Ali Abdullah Saleh and hes leading Yemen into the worst disasters it's ever seen in modern History. Mind you, a lot of ignorant Yemenis will end up hating Houthis and wish they have Affash back.  I know plenty of Zaydi Houthis who would hate to see Abdulmalik in charge and you come from buttfuck nowhere with no idea what Yemen is, being fed shia sunni bullshit that didn't really apply at this scale in Yemen until very recently.   Why do you and so many others on this sub either support a dictator whose been in power 35+ years (also a Zaydi) or bombing the country into democracy."

I've always hated the Saudi government but I didn't think they're that horribly ignorant and naive. Don't they have enough money to hire white people advisors like Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011 revolution?  The Saudis want to delay the talks until they make more gains on the ground even though every delay is a disadvantage to them since they're losing more and more on the ground. Lots of treason and back stabs hitting the Saudis as well, like when they supported Al-Shaief in Jowf and he handed everything to the Houthis and dipped with his Saudi money. Hadi was always a very smart man but never implemented his thoughts and always stayed silent. Seems like things changed and hes a complete retard now. A few problems with Houthis is much better than these current catastrophes. How do they still think delaying is good....   Edit: Added 2011"
YemeniCrisis,39xm4z,fusfusman,3,Mon Jun 15 20:03:03 2015 UTC,"I doubt it's a matter of wanting to delay the Houthi delegation. Trust me, the Saudis are as sick of it as Hadi is. The fact that the Houthis have ended up at the negotiation table is victory enough for the Saudis at the time being. After all, that was the point of the entire campaign in the first place.   I think it's more that the Houthis don't want to enter coalition airspace. That was the reason they refused to go to a delegation held in a coalition member-state, and that was the reason they ditched the first flight out through Saudi. The Houthis are probably afraid the delegation would be stopped and arrested, which as unlikely as that would be explains their refusal to enter Saudi, Egyptian, or Sudanese airspace."
YemeniCrisis,39xm4z,Butt-Pain,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:39:26 2015 UTC,I completely disagree. The Houthis didn't board the first plane that was supposed to take them because they didn't like the way the invitation was written and I have it from good authority that only one guy actually showed up in the airport. The invitation was then changed to make the Houthis happy and then they agreed to go. They might be a little scared of the meetings because of their incompetence but I seriously doubt it. The whole going to Geneva talks was Saleh's idea in the first place and they kinda have a point in not having a meeting in a non - neutral country.  Saudis are definitely sick of Hadi but they will insist that they must come out of this war victorious and nothing less. I personally cannot imagine them finding a face saving way out.   Edit: I don't think they achieved any of their stated goals other than protect themselves by taking out most scuds and some help to the resistance. The whole thing was half-assed and poorly planned.
YemeniCrisis,39xm4z,fusfusman,2,Tue Jun 16 00:10:57 2015 UTC,"The invitation was then changed to make the Houthis happy and then they agreed to go.   I'm interested, can you refer me please?  I agree with how it only makes sense to hold it in a neutral country, though I wouldn't say it was Saleh's idea in the first place to hold talks. That guy's a rat. One day you throw it off the roof and then the next plop and he's under you in the toilet when you're taking a dump. He initially refused any talks at all and Saudi press was complaining about not being able to hold talks with the Houthis because they wouldn't come. I feel like they should have been able to hold something back when there was a delegation in Oman but I guess Hadi's party wasn't up for it. The first time Saleh actually called for talks was when his house was bombed.  As for the Saudi side of the conflict, they really are getting annoyed by Hadi given his indecisiveness. At this point, as well, the Saudis would rather get the war over with. War is expensive. I wouldn't necessarily say it was poorly planned, though. This war was carried out with the Saudi knowing they had all they needed to sustain a war. Simply because they aren't really getting major results doesn't mean the air campaign's ineffective. Remember when the campaign against the IS began? Around 7-8 months ago. THAT hasn't yielded any fruit until recently, and that was after the fall of Palmyra and Ramadi. The Houthis have lost significant mobility, and there are some positive results around Ma'rib. Aside that there's how if it weren't for the airstrikes Taiz would have been crushed and Aden would have fallen long before now.  Either way, I hope to God this just ends in the best possible way for Yemen. It's a beautiful country with an amazing people. They deserve the best. The first thing you guys have to do, though, is when this mess is over you get rid of all your Qat. That's a huge factor to your food and water problem."

Right from the beginning of the war I wished the Saudis bombed Qat fields. That would've caused a huge up rise against the Houthis. Even in the middle of this war, lots of Yemenis that don't have ground fighting like Sanaa are still chilling trying to watch football games and such. Heh, I guess they got used to it real quick.

YemeniCrisis,39l6bi,WhySoSerious-_-,2,Sun Jun 14 13:33:46 2015 UTC,"Why so serious?   Well yea, the Saudis would know, lots of it was bought from them.

YemeniCrisis,39l6bi,Butt-Pain,-1,Sun Jun 14 14:21:36 2015 UTC,"lots of it was bought from them.   have you seen the UN report that says Iran have been sending arms to the Houthis since 2009? also the weapons used in Yemen now are Russian which hints Iran, Saudi Arabia doesn't have access to Russian weapons they only use American weapons. Russia and SA don't get along     because they got Ali Abdullah Saleh all patched up from the assassination attempt, and now the claim they want him out.   they got him patched up because he agreed to the GCC initiative and agreed to leave his office peacefully. Now they want him out because he's the man behind Houthi advance in Yemen. He's been president for 40 years and apparently its like addiction its not easy to let it go."

If they listened to the Iranians better, there wouldn't be a war and Houthis would have decent size political party with them/Saleh ruling in the back and Hadi as the legitimate face. Yemen always had a shit ton of weapons. In the past decade most of it is from Saudi and US."

Yemen has been a failed state for a real long time. It's all Ali Abdullah Saleh. A devilish genius and the mastermind behind this crisis.  One of the main factors is corruption. We do have oil but all the oil used in Yemen is imported. Even with the amount of fertile land we have, we import most food as well since most of the land is for qat.  Saleh plays all the sides. He had six wars with Houthis yet he supplied them with arms to fight him. He also helped fund Al-Qaeda indirectly. All so he can milk the Saudis, US and others to help him fight them.  All that's happening now is him having revenge for the revolution. He uses Houthis and Saudis as pawns while they think it's all their own decisions. Arguably, the biggest benefactor of the Saudi war on Yemen is Saleh and Houthis (and AQ). Saudi is not pleased with what's happening and would love to pull out in any face saving way so they're not getting anything out of it.   In the end lots of Yemenis will end up blaming Houthis, Hadi or Saudi for what happened and forget that Saleh was the one behind the scenes pulling all the strings.  I think the guy has more of a chance of choking on a cracker or old age than being assassinated or killed by Saudi."
YemeniCrisis,39lgel,Random10187,3,Tue Jun 16 18:35:03 2015 UTC,"North and South Yemen have had animosity between each other for decades. South Yemen used to be a British protectorate and after independence from the Brits was a country in its own right. They unified with the North in 1990, but 4 years later things soured between them and an all out war broke out which the North won. Since then they feel like they have been getting the short end of the stick. link. Some support Hadi but bulk are fighting to protect their cities and homes from what they consider an invasion from the North.  Both.

Because that is what the LaV is for, they would get out of they were in favorable terrain, but they were ambushed from a hill and they are in flat terrain whole under a storm of bullets. The correct thing to do against an enemy with ATGMs at that moment was to withdraw immediately to favorable terrain and call in Apache support, which is what they did.   Also from the camo in the bunker they got in it was manned by border guards. Border guards only have assault rifles and pick up trucks in terms of equipment, when under heavy assault procedure is that they withdraw immediately and let the army come in and deal with the infiltrators.   The border is HUGE, and these points were already manned by border guards and the army just moved dealing with each offensive as t happens."

Scouts don't mean that they get out of the vehicle and take a look around and then get back inside and drive off.   This is not to say that the situation was handled perfectly, it clearly wasn't. But not one soldier or border guard died and the Houthis were expelled the same day, preventing them from putting videos on YouTube is not worth risking soldier's lives.

Btw I never said Shaikh Al Jifri (HFA) was conclusively siding with the Houthis, I thought that was clear in the post. And he is absolutely anti-salafi and anti-takfiri there's just no argument there."

Is that not Takfir?    It absolutely is and it is condemnable, but do Houthis execute their POW or is it merely rhetoric on their part calling their opponents kafirs? Do they act upon their takfir a la the Syrian rebels?  Are you sure about the Habaib? I knew several of Al Jifri students in the UK who had attended Dar Al mustafa in Terim. They all considered the Habaib there as one clan seeing as they are all brothers, cousins, second cousins etc.   Thanks for your replies btw I am continuing to learn about this conflict and the players in it. Always good to hear directly from a yamani."

Stratfor’s June 2nd analysis on Aden:   In Aden, Houthi offensives have been continually blunted against the opposition, which managed to recapture terrain on the outskirts of the city. In the Aden peninsula, centralized Houthi forces are maintaining their blockade on anti-Houthi fighters located in the Western point of the peninsula, allegedly by using artillery fire to turn away ships laden with much-needed supplies. Meanwhile, Saudi-led coalition aircraft have continued to pound Houthi positions from the air, focusing heavily on the vulnerable border areas.   https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/houthis-pushed-back-yemen    Similar small advances in Taiz...

YemeniCrisis,37uktn,omarshamshoon1,2,Sat May 30 14:59:00 2015 UTC,"If this is true, this would be very interesting. For one it seems that the houthis are willing to sell out saleh and his homies.   Leading me to believe that salehs speech yesterday was very much directed to the houthis and his partnership with them. By claiming he was offered millions of dollars by Saudi to fight houthis, he was using this as a sign of good will towards them. He also said that the houthis never communicated they would be part of the Oman delegation. He even claimed that the wars between him and the houthis were more political than ideological etc.  I feel this rumor could be true and yesterday's speech could have been salehs way of saying ""hey, look at what I have done for you, don't sell me out"".   Also I see that the article mentions splitting yemen into two parts instead of six under federation. Can someone explain what that means and why the houthis might want that?"
YemeniCrisis,37uktn,Gladiator90,3,Sat May 30 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Saleh was trying to counter the Saudi media claims from two months ago that his son Ahmad  offered the Saudis an anti-Houthi coup in exchange for immunity for him and his father.  As for the two region thing, some say the Houthis support that because they want to monopolize power in the North but I find that unlikely, unless they could predict the present beforehand. They were advocating the same thing throughout the National Dialogue Conference. This was what they were saying in 2013:   Q: Regarding the division of Yemen, do you support or reject this?  We support the implementation of a clear vision regarding the issue of regions, and our representative at the 8+8 subcommittee has affirmed that we support the proposal submitted by the Yemeni Socialist Party, which suggests two regions in Yemen. We believe that this vision is the most suitable for the political status quo in Yemen, while it is also more economically realistic, particularly as the other options are impractical and difficult to fund. These options aim to fragment the South by dividing it into two regions, while dividing the North into four regions, even though the North has never been concerned with the issue of regions.  Q: Do the Houthis want to establish an independent state in Saada?  First, we do not support the division of Yemen, we support the establishment of a federal Yemen made up of two regions. As for the rumors that say that Ansar Allah want to take over Saada or isolate it or create a new region there, these are all untrue. The proof is that we have agreed to only two regions in Yemen, and if we had any intention to form a region for Ansar Allah, we would have accepted the proposal of dividing the North into four regions, which was proposed by the 1994 Allies.  Q: What do you mean by the 1994 Allies? Do you mean the Al-Islah Party and the General People’s Congress (GPC) Party?  We meant the Al-Islah Party and the GPC. However we do not mean the two parties themselves, but the Al-Islah Party leadership, which still adheres to the legitimacy of the 1994 war. The parties that dropped this issue or apologized, or distanced themselves from it, are not included in our accusations.   http://www.aawsat.net/2013/12/article55326008/houthi-spokesman-on-yemen-national-dialogue-dammaj-war-iran"

The Zaydi-Sunni divide is a recent veneer on the decades-long conflict between the north and the south, between capitalism-ish vs socialism-ish and the different, fractious and dynamic tribal coalitions that back each side.  All these factors play into one another, but we're seeing the Shia-Sunni conflict being super-imposed from within and without on Yemen's pre-existing cleavages.  What I find most worrying about the current conflict is that each side seems to be beginning to primarily define and divide themselves by religion, which is relatively new.

YemeniCrisis,37hkkf,Meow_Mixxx,13,Thu May 28 03:56:19 2015 UTC,I can't believe you guys think that's a nuke.  I'm embarrassed to be part of this sub right now.  So why is the KSA dropping big-ass bombs on a mountain?  My guess is shock and awe.  This is a psy-war op..
YemeniCrisis,37hkkf,bopollo,8,Thu May 28 04:56:57 2015 UTC,"welcome to YemeniCrisis Subreddit, enjoy your stay. Those are mountain weapon depots."
YemeniCrisis,37hkkf,Mosamania,-1,Thu May 28 03:56:33 2015 UTC,"Seriously why do you not believe it after all the evidence points towards it being a nuclear bomb, there are very clear radiation signals in the video, especially when they do the slow mo of the main explosion. Who are you that you would ignore the evidence. look for the small white dots near the explosion during the slow mo then look at the video in these comments showing radiation and how it affect a camera. No doubt in my mind that this was either a full blown mini nuke or a very dirty bomb which is just as bad as a nuke in many ways."
YemeniCrisis,37hkkf,idontcarewhoiam,0,Thu May 28 05:37:10 2015 UTC,"I watched all of the videos available online, I must say that It does look like one single explosion and it is very different from other videos where munition storage units can be seen going off. The sparkles are the main giveaway. Some want to say that those sparks are munition going off, but in some of the videos you can see sparkles foreground in front of the buildings 2-3 sec after explosion, thus it is clear that those ain't munitions going off, but, most likely, proton bombardment of the camera sensor. Some people think that EMP should have fried all electronics in the area, however that is not the case here as EMP varies with the weapon yield and burst altitude. The weapon yield must have been quite small, since if it was like 5-10KT, those standing there would suffer at least 1st degree burns. Also, by the brightness, that was most likely nuclear. Conventional weapons don't burn that hot. This one burned for quite a long time and extremely hot, one can see that by the way it makes surroundings go dim (you can see this in nuclear weapons tests). Usually nukes would be detonated on 100-150ft altitude, but this one looks like a bunker buster. I did write question to IAEA about this. No answer yet. will post it as soon as I get the answer."
YemeniCrisis,37hkkf,catalysthell,10,Fri May 29 20:49:35 2015 UTC,Is it possible that it was just an ammunition and fuel storage? Because I've seen a propane factory burst into flames and it kinda looks like this.

The closer the camera the more pronounced the effect. This makes it plausible to me that radio activity is the by product of the explosion. It's also possible that radioactive material got blown up in the attack, but the pattern of the flashes follows the fire ball perfectly, suggesting that the radiation is from the explosion itself."

YemeniCrisis,37hkkf,LeTomato52,-6,Thu May 28 16:50:55 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Some of the modern nuclear arsenal includes nuclear weapons that have an effective radius of less than 100 meters. The flash was pretty bright and lasted a long time, typical of nuclear explosions. The blinding lights that you see in films like terminator are the result of city-leveler nuclear bombs which we don't really use anymore. Most nukes are designed to take out armored columns and carrier strike groups.   There are a lot of rumors of the US using small tactical nukes in the middle east that look like this."
YemeniCrisis,37hkkf,UsernameIWontRegret,3,Wed May 27 20:45:35 2015 UTC,"Ok then, how would SA get one and why would they use it on a mountain?

YemeniCrisis,37hkkf,LeTomato52,1 point,Thu May 28 01:22:04 2015 UTC,Could it have been the initial drop of fuel for a Fuel Air Bomb? It would explain the delay in the explosion.
YemeniCrisis,37hkkf,PierreDeuxPistolets,-4,Thu May 28 01:50:11 2015 UTC,"Well to answer for why they might have used it on a mountain is an easy answer. A lot of the ""nukes"" the US used in the middle east were on mountains. Mountains are very hard to penetrate, and the enemy can be really entrenched and there may be no other way to kill them/get them out than a really big bomb."
YemeniCrisis,37hkkf,UsernameIWontRegret,5,Sun May 31 19:12:02 2015 UTC,"I remember some media outlets were up in arms thinking that the US detonated a nuke over Baghdad in 2003.  It was just a conventional explosive that hit a weapons depot or something.  Actually, conspiracy theorists STILL think a nuke was detonated there despite no evidence.  Explosions are bigger in real life than people think they are.  Nuclear explosions are even bigger than that.  That's the long and short of it."

YemeniCrisis,37hkkf,IamSwedishSuckMyNuts,0,Wed May 27 21:08:38 2015 UTC,"No, not  really. Bellow are the effects of a kiloton neutron bomb. This would have been a smaller one.    Use   Neutron bombs are purposely designed with explosive yields lower than other nuclear weapons. Since neutrons are absorbed by air,[6] neutron radiation effects drop off very rapidly with distance in air, there is a sharper distinction, as opposed to thermal effects, between areas of high lethality and areas with minimal radiation doses.   ...   Effects  Upon detonation, a 1 kiloton neutron bomb near the ground, in an airburst would produce a large blast wave, and a powerful pulse of both thermal radiation and ionizing radiation, mostly in the form of fast (14.1 MeV) neutrons. The thermal pulse would cause third degree burns to unprotected skin out to approximately 500 meters. The blast would create at least 4.6 PSI out to a radius of 600 meters, which would severely damage all non-reinforced concrete structures, at the conventional effective combat range against modern main battle tanks and armored personnel carriers (<690–900 m) the blast from a 1 kt neutron bomb will destroy or damage to the point of non-usability almost all un-reinforced civilian building. Thus the use of neutron bombs to stop an enemy armored attack by rapidly incapacitating the crew with a dose of 8000+ Rads of radiation,[36] which would require exploding large numbers of them to blanket the enemy forces, would also destroy all normal civilian buildings in the same immediate area ~600 meters,[36][37] and via neutron activation it would make many building materials in the city radioactive, such as Zinc coated steel/galvanized steel(see Area denial use below). Although at this ~600 meter distance the 4-5 PSI blast overpressure would cause very few direct casualties as the human body is resistant to sheer overpressure, the powerful winds produced by this overpressure are capable of throwing human bodies into objects or throwing objects-including window glass at high velocity, both with potentially lethal results, rendering casualties highly dependent on surroundings, including on if the building they are in collapses.[38] The pulse of neutron radiation would cause immediate and permanent incapacitation to unprotected outdoor humans in the open out to 900 meters,[4] with death occurring in one or two days. The lethal dose(LD50) of 600 Rads would extend to about 1350–1400 meters for those unprotected and outdoors,[36] where approximately half of those exposed would die of radiation sickness after several weeks. However a human residing within, or is simply shielded by at least 1 of the aforementioned concrete buildings with walls and ceilings 30 centimeters/12 inches thick, or alternatively of damp soil 24 inches thick, the neutron radiation exposure would be reduced by a factor of 10"

Whilst this bomb wasn't in a 1 kiloton yield category, it still was close enough to Sanaa for a lot of people to pick up a (LD50) dose or at least fall very ill if it were a neutron bomb (something KSA isn't even capable of producing). This is embarrassing. Absolutely everything you write here tells me you have no idea of what you're talking about."

YemeniCrisis,37h7r9,InsightfulWaffle,9,Wed May 27 16:45:03 2015 UTC,"IMO the Houthi/Saleh objective isn't to control the entire country, but to achieve a favourable outcome in future peace negotiations.  In seeking that objective, I think they are clearly winning.  They're embarrassing the Saudis.  If they can secure Aden (which could happen any day now), it'll probably be enough of a symbolic victory to force the Saudis' hand.  Then everyone will try to figure out some way for the Saudis to make a face-saving exit."
YemeniCrisis,37h7r9,bopollo,7,Wed May 27 18:06:12 2015 UTC,"You have to define what ""winning"" means to each side.  The Saudi-led coalition and its allies in Yemen (those supporting President Hadi) have made it their stated (or perhaps unstated, depending on how you read the language) goal of ousting the Houthis from power, including their hold on Northern Yemen.  Using that as a yardstick to measure success, it can't truly be said that they are truly ""winning"".  The Houthis are still pretty strong in Northern Yemen and in particular the capital Sana'a, and have expanded a bit into Southern Yemen.    For the Houthis part, it is kind of unclear what they are looking to do.  If their goal is control of the entire country, they have some limited success but not total control by any stretch.  If their goal is simply maintaining control over Northern Yemen to use as a bargaining chip at the negotiating table in order to get some portion of power in a ""new"" Yemen, well then I think they are doing a fairly good job.  The Houthis' true goal will probably not ever be known to anyone outside of the Houthi leadership because coming out and saying either of the above would be unpopular.  So for their part it's kind of a question mark.    IS/Al-Qaeda/whatever, they're in the same position they were before, living on the fringes.  So they're not really winning or losing.    It should go without saying that the true ""losers"" in this conflict are the civilians.  People's lives have been disrupted as school and work, and crucial services have been disrupted.  I've been told otherwise, but from what I've seen this conflict has opened up some old wounds between North and South.    So, all that said, I'm unsure how to fully answer your question.  If I had to make a declarative statement, I'd say that if the Houthis manage to maintain their control over Northern Yemen, it would be very hard for Hadi and the Saudis to convincingly declare victory.  My guess is that at some point they will withdraw and do what Nixon did in Vietnam and call it ""peace with honor"" or some variation."
YemeniCrisis,37h7r9,fascinating123,2,Wed May 27 17:14:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining that, and I think you bring up a very good point of what the houthis goals actually are. This is something I haven't completely understood yet even though I follow this situation closely.  I know they intend to use their control over yemen for negotiations. But then how would you explain their role in the south. It would be very hard for them to take over the south because the  people there will not surrender to them and see them as invaders. I see this as a lot a lack of defined goals for the houthis. They simply cannot take over all of yemen. North yemen, possibly. But definitely not the south.   Wouldn't the north have been enough to use for negotiations? But being in provinces like dhale, Aden, and eastern yemen seems almost useless as it will drain them militarily and most likely not result in complete victory. They are just creating a greater division between them and the south. This division will most likely assure that when the war ends these divisions will fracture yemen even more.   I just find it every hard to form a complete picture of what their goals are, what do they want from the south, why the alliance with saleh who they've fought with before, what saleh wants (there is no way he can ever retain power after all this, then what is he fighting for?), and why is the military still so loyal to him. I'm not sure anyone fully knows the answer to these questions. Yemen politics has always been confusing."
YemeniCrisis,37h7r9,Gladiator90,2,Wed May 27 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"Well, why did the Confederate military bother trying to capture Washington, DC in the American Civil War?  Logically, all they had to do was dig in and bleed the Union Army dry (in fact this strategy was used at one point and General Robert E. Lee was nicknamed the ""King of Spades"" for it) but if they were to capture Washington they could effectively force the Union government to the negotiating table quickly.  Also, a convincing victory in Union territory might have made it easier for the French and British to decide to give aid to the Confederacy.  I don't like historical parallels because history never fully repeats itself (despite the saying) but some things are similar.  By making gains in Southern Yemen, the Houthis can make the Saudi coalition take them seriously.  Like you, I don't think they have any illusions about controlling all of Yemen.  But if you want international legitimacy, expanding outside of your base of power can be quite beneficial.    Also, if they leave the South completely unmolested, it's possible that the coalition could try to use that as a base of operations from which they could attempt to take the North.  Leave the South in ruins, it's a lot harder to do that.  Or, maybe the people in the South will be more willing to just let the Houthis have the North and be done with it.  There are a lot of possibilities in play here.    The major point is, until the coalition changes tactics (like say take a scorched earth policy and just ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"" so to speak) or move the goal posts, it'll be hard for them to win.  And they're certainly not winning right now.  As for what Saleh (or for the matter Hadi) truly wants out of this, I'm at a loss as well.  One would have thought that he would have long ago traded in whatever chips he had and parlayed it into a nice home in Potomac, Maryland where the former Shah of Iran's family now resides.  There's nothing much for him left in Yemen so I can only assume that power not only corrupts, but is also addictive.  No amount of overseas comfort can replace the feeling of wielding a great deal of power and influence.  I could be wrong of course, but that's what it looks like.    As for the divisions in Yemen, I think they've always been there.  Or at least they've been there for a while."
YemeniCrisis,37h7r9,fascinating123,1 point,Wed May 27 19:11:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining all that. The coalition goals are clear to me. But I don't think I will ever fully understand houthis or saleh. Saleh's case I feel is simpler, like gaddafi- he will fight until he's defeated or achieves victory.  Houthis, I don't fully understand. I mean they are battling hard but they are incurring a lot of loses. Are the risks they are taking worth the reward they are seeking? I don't know. If this war goes bad for them, they could find themselves alienated on all sides. But I just find it funny it's been 2 months of this war and I have no idea what they are hoping to achieve. Maybe the delegation in Oman will clear this up soon."
YemeniCrisis,37h7r9,Gladiator90,1 point,Wed May 27 21:20:27 2015 UTC,"I think the Houthis are primarily motivated by a belief that they can win this fight.  Beyond that, I think they're simply repeating their history.  A foreign power wants to control them, and yet again, they're going to turn the country into a graveyard for that invader.  In this case, the invader has been invading for decades now.  The Saudis view Yemen as within their sphere of influence, and they've been meddling in all sorts of ways.  The Houthi movement is in direct reaction to that."
YemeniCrisis,37h7r9,bopollo,1 point,Wed May 27 22:19:18 2015 UTC,"They had no choice. You have to understand the stakes here. The Saudis don't want Houthis to have any position in government including a cabinet seat. They have been repeatedly stifled since 2011 despite being the largest political movement in the country.  When the Houthis took over in Sept they wanted to negotiate for a coalition government. Hadi refused because the red line from the Saudis are clear. For months they put up with him and for months he's refused. That is why he ran away in Feb. He ran to Aden and decided to create a ""government in exile"".  His and the Saudi plan was to use Aden to run a second government. They wanted to build up forces in the area, move embassys and international organisations to Aden and away from Sanaa. They were planning on taking back the north as the ""legitimate"" government.  What they didn't calculate was that Hadi would have so little support. His ""forces"" collapsed. Many just didn't want to fight for him. Even know with all the air attacks his forces are struggling to win.  Right now the biggest argument Hadi has with the Houthi is about his legitimacy. He wants the  Houthis to recogonise him as the legitimate government. This guy has no authority in the ground outside of Saudi recognition.  He needs it validate by them or he'll have no chance for power again. I think its already to late. The man ran away and asked foreigners to bomb his country. There are just some things people don't accept."

YemeniCrisis,37h7r9,fascinating123,1 point,Wed May 27 20:46:20 2015 UTC,"anything short of that is a failure.   Then they're doomed to failure, as at best, the Houthis would simply retreat to their northern strongholds.  Even if they're expelled from Sana'a, they'll still control important territory in Yemen.  I can't imagine KSA and its allies don't know that.   Of course they could move the goal posts and settle for less. But just like American ""victory"" in Vietnam, it would seem a bit hollow, no?   I think it's balancing an achievable victory with a hollow victory.  They can't destroy the Houthis or really even expel them from the territory they've taken.  Unless they're seriously considering a full invasion, their goals are unrealistic.  I think it's more likely that they'll try to aim for some political deal in which the Houthis withdraw from what they've taken, and a new government in put in power.

Appearances may be deceiving, but it doesn't seem like the Saudi led coalition has achieved anything.  There have been two months of bombs and blockades with what to show for it?

Her best option for now might be to just ride it out in Sanaa. Hope she stays safe and reunite soon.

I feel like shit since she still hasn't managed to get a move on and hes probably feels really frustrated that nothing has happened in the past couple of weeks.  There was another random family that reached out to me to hear my experience about how I got out. The whole family had diplomatic passports and first degree relatives  that are residents in Europe.  This was a while back before they even needed the wizard level wasta to leave through the airport. They did absolutely buttfuck nothing and they didn't even try to leave. They were stubborn and said typical Yemeni shit like ""it's gonna get better in two weeks"". They said this every fucking week even though I told them to get the fuck out and then simply go back when it's better.

YemeniCrisis,37426p,LorryWaraLorry,3,Mon May 25 02:53:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this has changed now (or if this method is no longer safe with the recent Houthi attack around the borders), but if you know someone in Saudi there are ways of entering through Al-Tuwal from Hodeidah. Said person can sponsor her as a ""kafil"" (he has to be Saudi obviously) and she can stay and do her thing.  Not sure on the exact details, but I think you'll need to send her passport copy so things can be pre-arranged. Also this person MUST be at the border to take her and he must have the papers and stuff. A US embassy interview request will probably help as well, so might be worth contacting the embassy in Saudi.  EDIT: people I know have also gone through Djibouti via a boat (a really shitty one, but mostly safe). I think the trick to it (as not needing a Djibouti visa) is to have a flight and a visa booked to another country (or flight to somewhere you're exempt from visa, last I heard is that Malaysia still do not require visas for Yemenis, but don't quote me on this). The port you go through is Al-Mokha port (from Hodeidah as well).  Basically she'll has to go through Hodeidah most likely, so if you know people there ask. There are occasional flights coming to and going from Sanaa, but these are mainly reserved for humanitarian cases or people with Wizard-Level ""wasta""!"

Numerous sources tell me that they think passing through the Saudi border is safer than taking a boat but yes, the trick is to have a flight booked before getting to Djibouti to be exempt from any payment.  Malaysia now claims to allow all Yemenis but a friend who went there from Djibouti tells me that they wouldn't allow people who don't have a decent amount of money with them to prove they're not gonna fuck around.

The amount of money and equipment the Saudis are throwing in the Yemeni campaign is just mindblowing next to the miniscule Iranian support for the Houthis, it's not like KSA lacks money but whats more important is that they are creating a mortal enemy on their southern border that they can't just bomb away. Iran's biggest victory in Yemen is that it has no resources there, but there is a movement that will be KSA's biggest enemy for some time now.   For now the Saudis are learning the limits of their power. Despite spending five times more on defense than Iran and acquiring scores of modern aircraft from the United States and the United Kingdom over many decades, Riyadh looks unable to get its way in Yemen or Iraq.   I don't really know why Iraq is mentioned here, KSA actually profits from the rise of Daesh, as long as Daesh is focused on Syria and Iraq, Iran will have to spend resources there, still Saudis don't want Daesh to get too strong who knows what would happen if they went with full force on KSA (probably a US intervention, but it would still be messy as hell).  Saudis have to learn that money and shiny toys don't win wars, to win a war you need reliable ground troops and a stable strong government, they are mostly trying to buy well trained foreign troops because they don't believe in the power of their own. They also can't rely on religious foreign fighters (like Iran can) because some of them might radicalize to much and attack them. If KSA wants to be a regional power for a longer time, they will have to get their country in order first, and than meddle into their neighborhood countries (in a smart way like Iran does, not just bombing everything to the ground), not the other way around."

YemeniCrisis,365sqo,Mosamania,7,Sat May 16 15:33:19 2015 UTC,"It's considered victory in the same way that 2006 war is considered a victory by Hezbollah. It's considered a victory because a couple thousand poorly armed, poorly trained insurgents got attacked from all sides by armies that were much stronger in both equipment and men power, and they despite all of that managed to take control over some territory from the army that had top notch western equipment and western training, and than managed to inflict serious casualties on them as they recaptured THEIR OWN territory. And after all of that they didn't get crushed, all that they had to do is accept a truce, I don't know how do you want to call that, but that war was a stalemate at best for KSA, and a defensive victory for the Houthis. If we consider the power difference KSA and Yemen should have just straight up crushed the houthis and forced them back into the mountains, not make them concede to a truce."

So if you mean that it was a victory that they just suddenly take over foreign soil and then being beaten back like rats. I wish the Houthis a thousand times similar victories. They didn't tale control of territory from the army, they took territory from cops and police. The army was another thing entirely as they learned later.   Also if accepting a truce with all opposition force's demands is considered a victory, then the Germans won in 1945 and the Germans won in WW1, they didn't get crushed and totally annihilated, they just signed a truce and accepted demands.

Which they were kicked out of Saudi territory. It was unprecedented in KSA's history than an armed gang would cross its border, as the border guards were just monitoring for smugglers not equipped to fight off mortars and RPGs at the time.    So the Houthis entered KSA and took some villages and plains in November, and the Saudi king said on 26. of December that the Army had fully expelled Houthis from Saudi territory, it took them nearly 2 months to expel a bunch of militiamen who had no training, no air support, no modern weaponary, and in the process 133 (Saudi claim according to wiki) Saudi soldiers got killed, and after all of that all that Houthis had to do was accept a truce that didn't weaken them in any significant way, that was a strategic defeat for the KSA, and the consequences of their failure than are biting them back now.   So if you mean that it was a victory that they just suddenly take over foreign soil and then being beaten back like rats. I wish the Houthis a thousand times similar victories. They didn't tale control of territory from the army, they took territory from cops and police. The army was another thing entirely as they learned later.    Beating them back in a week would be beating them back like rats, beating them back in a month would be somehow normal, beating them back after nearly two months of fighting, after deploying tens of thousands of soldiers there, and with all the air and artillery support is a disgrace.   Also if accepting a truce with all opposition force's demands is considered a victory, then the Germans won in 1945 and the Germans won in WW1, they didn't get crushed and totally annihilated, they just signed a truce and accepted demands. You people's logic is always fascinating.    The demands were different in these two cases. German army got completely disbanded, Germany lost territory (Houthi largely kept their areas in Yemen), Germany was forced to pay reparations, and as forced to accept occupying force in it's homeland, none of these things happened to Houthis."

It is not a plain, mountains as steep is not more than the ones in Afghanistan, and we didn't have the operational capabilities that we have today, so it took time.   So your argument now is that ""they won because they didn't lose fast enough""? Seriously? I do agree that it could have been done better, a lot better, but then the Saudi military had no experience in mountain warfare, not enough ISR capabilities as it has today and not enough precision guided munitions and their delivery system as it has today, so it took time and effort but they were successful in the end, ""They won because they didn't lose fast, but lost slowly, thus they won"", that is one helluva an argument you got there buddy.   Also you talk as if KSA was the main belligerent against the Houthis then. Actually the Houthis made gains from their Sa'adah stronghold against the Yemeni army, they got so riled up in victory frevor they thought they could take on KSA as well, the truce that was signed made the Houthis go back to their Tribal homeland and sign that they will never attack any other area again, which is within Yemeni political system that tribes are mostly autonomous."
YemeniCrisis,365sqo,Mosamania,7,Sat May 16 18:29:09 2015 UTC,"You are looking at that operation only from the Saudi side of things, yeah the Houthis got expelled from the territory they took from the Saudis, but that operation was shown to be a strategic failure for the Saudis (as seen right now) and a big propaganda defeat that they allowed a bunch of militiamen take the territory in which they have no local support. KSA failed in it's bid to support the Yemeni government to crush the Houthis, they even got their fair share of the damage. Also it doesn't matter what the Houthis signed, it matters what they did, and they definitely didn't fall back into their tribal areas. They actually kept all the territory they had, and they kept attacking the government and taking territory up until the Yemeni revolution when the government collapsed, and Saleh government was replaced by a weak, unsupported Hadi government which was more pro KSA, but he had no real power and got beaten back into KSA. The KSA's failure to first crush their own Hezbollah in the south (2009) has resulted in the Houthis gaining a lot of power and becoming a lot bigger problem for KSA."

You could say it lasts since 1979, but there was no bigger Shia-Sunni conflict in the 20th century before the Iranian revolution. Only once the Vilayat al Faqih came to Iran, Iran began actively pushing the Shia unity propaganda coupled with supporting their allied and proxies in foreign countries. Before the revolution Iran was a USA ally country like KSA is today, just that they didn't have so much freedom to expand themselves."

I used to have sleepless nights when I watched the very first Houthi speeches knowing how people actually believe that shit, and how a young man's claim that he wants no part of the government and he only wants to help the people.  The whole ( جرعة ) thing, which is what attracted so much popularity, reduced the the price of fuel by one thousand rials then multiplied it by ten. I am offended that you called me pro-Houthi and I am saddened that that's the vibe I'm making.   Yemen has been ruled by Hashimis for over 1200 years... we're all being screwed over.

What you cull and what you keep counts.   As for Houthis themselves, it's a bit too late for their ""rule"". I think we can all agree to that.  And Yemen has been loosely ""ruled"" by whoever over the ages - in Yaffa for example, one didn't really ""rule"" over the communities there. More like mediated when things got too big.  Not so much when fights broke out.  And that's been like that for centuries.   Which is no wonder that today the closest thing to singular rule we all agreed on was going to look like federated states. (Or a confederated League of states).

I'm getting real pisssed off with all the southerners that call it a war on the south. It's a war on Yemen for fucks sake.   I think the Houthis will get a share of power in the future as a political party. I think I told you weeks ago that their whole plan is to use their control over Aden and other places as leverage for negotiations. When the Houthis make their deals and pull out of Aden then the people in the south can start getting organized and head for secession.

YemeniCrisis,35wwce,wolflarsen,1 point,Sun May 17 01:54:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't say ""all those articles are pro houthi"".  I said that whole thing as one entity acts as being pro-Houthi.  It doesn't have enough Houthi-critical news - that's all.  The civil war was brought to the southern towns. We form a 1/2 cirlce around Sanaa from Marib to Taiz.  Get critical of that, dude.    Houthis yes are getting pounded (by TEN Arab states) right now but they didn't get the war brought to them - they brought it upon themselves.  They are uniquically to blame for bringing force to the matter. Can't cry tears if it blows up in their faces.  Also, at this point I think it is safe to say that the South could actually care even less about what happens to all things Houthi.  We have forgotten the name ""Saleh"", or ""Dehbaash"", or ""bilaatqeh"".  Now it's just the god damn Houthis.    As far as the notion of Aden a ""negotiation piece"" it's a bit late for that kind of negotiating.   As for them sharing any power - sure, if you think post WWII Germany had power over the US, then fine.  Otherwise there is no way Saada will be allowed to directly rule over southern regions. It will not be expected.      All in all, the south is flat out not to blame for Houthi power and blood lust.  You must keep this in mind when it is time to judge who was wronged and who was the one doing the wrong.  We didn't bring any fight to them.  They brought it to us."

YemeniCrisis,35c4di,Butt-Pain,3,Fri May 8 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"Translation: The Houthis rejected humanitarian cease fire!!!  That is the title of a big lie propugated by the aggressor (Saudi) about the humanitarian cease fire. Saudi is waging an aerial war from one side, and it is the one enforcing an embargo on Yemeni ports and preventing aid and fuel supplies. Letting these materials into Yemen is up to Saudi  and the Houthis have nothing to do with it. The lie of a cease fire requires a war between two sides and both must commit to a cease fire. As long as there are multiple groups that wage war against Ansarallah ""Houthis"" and the Yemeni military, all with different names that include the popular resistance, Ansar Al-Sharia, Al-Qaeda and the tribesman, and these groups are not a side (included) in the cease fire, how do they ask Houthis to commit to it just because Saudi announced to commit, as if the Saudi military is the one waging the war in Aden, Taiz, Dhale and Abian.  Ansarallah could stop the war on the Saudi front that was opened in Saudi's border where they face the Saudi army directly, them and the tribesman. But the other open fronts with other groups didn't announce their commitment to a cease fire so they (Ansarallah)  cannot agree to a cease fire. Furthermore, getting humanitarian aid to enter most parts of Yemen doesn't necessarily need a cease fire but needs the embargo to be lifted from ports and airports and the aid will reach all those parts of Yemen even the ones with the war still inflamed by. There might be a real need for a cease fire in Aden, Taiz, Dhale, Abian and different internal fronts to get the wounded out, exchange dead bodies and to facilitate the arrival of nutritional/medical and fuel supplies under the condition that all parties involved in the conflict commit to it directly or have Saudi commit to the cease fire for them. But to ask only the Houthis is great trickery/unfair (مغالطة) and an underestimation of the minds.  I gave translating it a shot. Feel free to point out if I did something wrong.   Instantly edited a couple of spelling mistakes."
YemeniCrisis,35c4di,Guberniya,2,Fri May 8 23:57:23 2015 UTC,"So, basically: ""We're up for a ceasefire as long as everyone firing actually ceases""? Sounds perfectly reasonable to me."

You don't have to agree with everything Iran does, I certainly don't. But in my honest opinion Saudi causes the most instability in the region, and does almost nothing to help the Palestinian people.   Some Lebanese don't like Hezbollah because they fight against Israel. Who do you think trained Hamas? It was Hezbollah. Who funded Palestine? Not Saudi, it was Iran. Hezbollah and Hamas cut ties together because of their differences in the Syrian conflict.   Actually I completely disagree with your last point. Israel cannot invade Iran, especially with Syria, Lebanon, and its other allies around. This is why Israel tried taking down Lebanon and this is why they love it when Saudi sends their soldiers in Syria. Bashar Assad has done terrible things, but he is still an enemy to Israel and they would rather have ISIS in the region killing muslims than a strong Arab leader that supports Iran.

Iran is no more peaceful than Saudi Arabia. The main difference being that Saudi Arabia's soft power inspires suicide bombers while Iran has to plan its bombings itself.   The list goes on:  In July 2012, The Times of India reported that New Delhi police have concluded that terrorists belonging to a branch of Iran’s military, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, were responsible for an attack on 13 February 2012, during which a bomb explosion targeted an Israeli diplomat in New Delhi, India, wounding one embassy staff member, a local employee, and two passers-by. According to the report, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards may have planned other attacks on Israeli targets around the world as well.

The 1983 Beirut barracks bombing of the U.S. Marine and French 'Drakkar' barracks which killed 241 American and 58 French peacekeepers. On May 30, 2003, a U.S. federal judge ruled that Hezbollah carried out the attack at the direction of the Iranian government.  The 1983 Kuwait bombings in collaboration with the Iraqi Dawa Party.

According to Middle East analyst James Philips, an August 1989 bombing in London was a failed Hezbollah assassination attempt on Indian-born British author Salman Rushdie, after the Iranian government put a $2.5 million bounty on his head over the novel The Satanic Verses. Iranian officials have repeatedly called for Rushdie's death as recently as 2005.  The bombing of the Israeli Embassy killing twenty-nine in 1992. Hezbollah operatives boasted of involvement.  The bombing of a Jewish community center in Argentina killing 95 in 1994. Hezbollah claimed responsibility.  The 1994 AC Flight 901 attack, killing 21, in Panama. Hezbollah claimed responsibility.  The 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, killing 19 US servicemen. On December 22, 2006, federal judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled that Iran was responsible for the attack, stating ""The totality of the evidence at trial...firmly establishes that the Khobar Towers bombing was planned, funded, and sponsored by senior leadership in the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The defendants' conduct in facilitating, financing, and providing material support to bring about this attack was intentional, extreme, and outrageous.""  The 2012 Burgas bus bombing, killing 6, in Bulgaria.  You can be Pro-Iran, just be honest about your reasons, don't cloak them in false morality.   Edit: More-  According to Seth G. Jones and Peter Bergen, the 2003 Riyadh compound bombings were planned by al Qaeda operatives in Iran, with apparent Iranian complicity. In May 2003, then-State Department official Ryan Crocker provided information on the upcoming attack to Iranian officials, who apparently took no action.  Mykonos restaurant assassinations. On September 17, 1992, Iranian-Kurdish insurgent leaders Sadegh Sharafkandi, Fattah Abdoli, Homayoun Ardalan and their translator Nouri Dehkordi were assassinated at the Mykonos Greek restaurant in Berlin, Germany. In the Mykonos trial, the courts found Kazem Darabi, an Iranian national who worked as a grocer in Berlin, and Lebanese Abbas Rhayel, guilty of murder and sentenced them to life in prison. Two other Lebanese, Youssef Amin and Mohamed Atris, were convicted of being accessories to murder. In its 10 April 1997 ruling, the court issued an international arrest warrant for Iranian intelligence minister Hojjat al-Islam Ali Fallahian[75] after declaring that the assassination had been ordered by him with knowledge of supreme leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and president Ayatollah Rafsanjani."

Barrel bombs are improvised conventional high explosive/incendiary rounds that are then dropped from helicopters much in the same way that bombs were dropped in WW2."

Once KSA went on a solo ground operation all eyes of the world would be on them, they would be considered a joke if they got totally defeated, I won't even mention that their stability would suffer significantly as well (fanatics would hate the Royals even more now, Eastern Shia's would get a huge motivation for their own protests etc.). Even if they actually managed to get a victory they would have to stay in the north for a longer time if they don't want the Houthis to just return again, and they would be faced with a Taliban style insurgency which would cost the Saudis many lives.

YemeniCrisis,34y7ac,ryud0,1 point,Wed May 6 01:17:31 2015 UTC,"Sure, but let's say Houthis finally turn back and just do what they wanted which is attack KSA.  If that happens then I guess the USA's direct interests are going to be affected and yes we might enter.   But right now we should be all for stopping the Houthis (they are NOT doing the favor of fighting AQ, since that group is sitting pretty)."
YemeniCrisis,34y7ac,sihtydaernacuoytihsy,1 point,Tue May 5 23:44:06 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts:   I'm pretty sure I don't like any of the sides in the conflict. Not the old dictator, Saleh; not the ""Death to America""-chanting Houthis; not the house of Saud (whose tolerance and funding of extremism have been... unhelpful... to the cause of justice); and not Al Qaeda. I'm very unclear how direct US involvement can be effected without picking one or more of those sides.  I can understand the realpolitik of, but still dislike, the US-Saudi alliance. It seems the US is doing its minimal duty to help the Saudis consistent with keeping Saudi friendship. I suppose I'd prefer a friendly Saudi government to a hostile one, but neither would be as pleasant as an cosmopolitan, tolerant, and democratic one. (Preferably, however improbably, brought about without bloodshed.) I was extremely opposed to GW Bush's Iraq adventure, and presume that ""boots on the ground"" in Yemen, as in Syria, would look a lot like Iraq. I agree that there's no ""debate"" in the US, but that's because neither the GOP nor the Democrats want to ""own"" American assistance to Saudi Arabia in its bombing of Yemen. So neither has brought it up, which means that the chattering classes don't have much to say about it, as such a discussion would be extremely hypothetical. (The minor parties, Green or Libertarian, would reject the bombing campaign as unjust and as outside of the US's core interests, respectively.) Only if the GOP could find an event politically useful (see Benghazi) would Yemen find its way to the front of the US political debate.  I don't really understand what peace and reconciliation might look like in Yemen. Nevermind democracy, I'd like to see someone advocating for a moderate compromise of vague rule of law, a bit of democratic legitimacy, and a minimally-functioning state. Asking to turn Yemen into Denmark is too much, too soon. How about... Jordan? But I don't see anyone even attempting to do this.  This makes me sad. I just wanted the frontline documentary on the crisis--little children chanting death to me. I wanted to explain, to show them that they don't need to hold on to such hate, that it would be okay if we just all play soccer instead.     (Disclosure: American here. I voted for Obama both times, and will under no reasonable circumstances be voting Republican in 2016.)"
YemeniCrisis,34y7ac,directaction,3,Tue May 5 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand what peace and reconciliation might look like in Yemen.   ""The immediate priority should be a UN Security Council brokered and monitored ceasefire, followed by UN-led peace talks with GCC backing, without preconditions, focusing on the presidency and leaving other power-sharing topics until basic agreement is reached on a single president with one or multiple vice presidents or a presidential council. Agreement on the executive would enable further talk on other aspects of pre-election power sharing in the government and military, and on state structure, particularly the future of the south, where separatist sentiment is strong. Both have been core drivers of conflict since the NDC ended in January 2014."""

So the Houthis and Hadi would agree on a cease-fire, then some kind of power-sharing agreement, and a slow return to normalcy--with a big chunk of the country still under AQAP control. If that's the best-reasonable-case scenario, we can see why there's little debate on it--there's a lot of downside, and not much upside."

The real problem of proxy war must begin with the fact that the United States and its NATO allies opened the floodgates for regional proxy wars by the two major wars for regime change in Iraq and Libya.  The crimes committed by the Syrian regime in the war are unconscionable, but the policies of external countries pursuing a proxy war to overthrow the existing regime have created a far more ominous threat to the entire region.

Part of me wonders what Senegal's stake in the game is. I couldn't find anything about Senegal's relationship with KSA and the other Gulf states, but from what I can tell (and if I'm wrong, please feel free to correct me), they have sort of a rocky relationship with Iran.    They've had an economic partnership going on, at least since 2008. But between 2011 and 2013, Senegal cut all diplomatic ties with Iran, because they claimed that Iran had supplied weapons to rebels in the Casamance region. So maybe they want to check Iran's power as well? Maybe?  Again, I'm way out of my league on this one. Could someone educate me please?"

The arab spring caused a vacancy of power; internal disputes of how to rule and who should rule occurred. Leading to uprisings of different political groups intertwined with remaining divisions of the ex government/military. Lastly, flamed even further by the Saudi/Iran rivalry that is occurring elsewhere in the region.   When and how this will end is anyone's guess. Everyday that goes by is causing a deeper rift in Yemen between numerous groups as well in the entire Middle east. This could go on a while or could be solved by negotiations swiftly. It could turn into Iraq, Syria, Libya, or even all three or it could not. Who knows. Yemen has always been very divided and most likely this will create even deeper divisions in an already impoverished country."

I don't sympathize at all or even remotely justify these actions, but this is my way of allocating the blame to those who deserve it. Abdel-Malik al-Houthi and Ali Abdullah Saleh and their constant lies are disgusting, and quite frankly they're the ones (along with those who know what they're doing) who deserve to drown in Yemen's tears and blood."

Edit: Asiri said the plane had ""clearance"" to fly through Yemen but I didn't get to what destination. But said the pilot entered the airspace not in the time agreed upon and started heading towards Sanaa airport, which he didn't have authorisation to. Planes with humanitarian aid have to go coordinate with coalition and fly to Sannaa from Saudi or other countries approved by the Coalition. Saudi tried to call upon pilot to change heading but there was no response. Asiri says that then they followed procedure and hit the runway. Then the Iranian plane changed destination and started heading towards Iran. Asiri says this was irresponsible and put at risk ongoing efforts of delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen.

YemeniCrisis,343i8t,Eveco,3,Tue Apr 28 15:45:47 2015 UTC,"The takeover of half of Yemen by the Houthis along with the continued bombing campaign, international isolation, and economic crisis, will create a very destablized society for years to come.   Even if the Saudis were to stop bombing now, so much of the economy is ruined; the continued hostilities the Houthis face in their efforts to consolidate control over the country, will contribute to a cycle of violence, poverty, and destruction of infrastructure which will make it extremely difficult for the country to recover from. Regardless of who's in charge, if anyone is able to take control over the country, then at least the rebuilding can begin. But that seems very unlikely even if the Saudis stopped bombing tomorrow.  The problem is that in any conflict, once the bloodletting has begun, it creates a cycle of hatred, fear, and revenge. It also divides them and makes it impossible for reconciliation and cooperation among group. And it creates a ""war economy"", in that the only ""jobs"" available will be to fight, and each fighting faction become more like a mafia, extracting resources but using it to pay their soldiers. All of these factors become much harder to reverse as the conflict continues, which shows no signs of slowing down.   Al-Qaida and these people are rubbing their hands together with glee. They will for sure be the main beneficiaries. With all the bases, arms depots, and equipment lying untouched and possibly unguarded across Eastern/Southern Yemen, they will be able to get a lot of useful equipment. Obviously the destablized political landscape will allow them to act with impunity. And even more depressingly, following in the vein of the previous paragraph, some people may be attracted to fight for them as they see Al-Qaida as a counterweight to the Houthis. So Al-Qaida will for sure be much more active and dangerous than ever before.   The Houthis still seem to be in the driving seat. I don't think they will be uprooted unless there is a long hard struggle between them and other proxies propped up and funded by Saudi Arabia (maybe certain tribes in Marib, Southerners?), or there is a ground invasion of the Saudis or someone else. The latter seems unlikely, but the former moreso.   The exiled government of Hadi/Bahah etc seem incapable of influencing anything on the ground. Though I remember reading that a couple of battalions recently pledged allegiance to Hadi, and will presumably follow his orders, I think there will still be a disconnect between the people fighting on the ground (who are Pro-Hadi/Pro-exiled government) and the actual government in Saudi Arabia. How much credibility can Hadi have, giving orders from a compound in Saudi, and groups will stay with him even though they are the ones shedding blood.   Who the hell knows what Saleh is up to. That one is too difficult to answer. Obviously everyone has said that there is an alliance between Saleh and the Houthis, but for how long will that last? Besides, with the current situation, it's not impossible to see him getting killed at some point (how he's managed to survive since 1978 is just a miracle!)  It is sad to say that Yemen will face a continued armed struggle for years, definitely years, to come. Between whom? it is hard to say, anything can happen. But for sure I am not convinced any one group will be able to take control of the country soon and consolidate. Therefore, the fighting will continue, new groups and alliances will emerge, the economy is already destroyed, and a lot of regular folk will really struggle. The economic situation of ordinary Yemenis was very badly affected just after the Arab Spring, there was a wide host of problems, and you could really see the difference (compared to the years before) in the eyes of Yemenis following the Arab Spring. You could tell that they were really suffering. I cannot even imagine what it is like now. Much much worse."

YemeniCrisis,340ve2,PUHOOL_OHOOYRF,5,Mon Apr 27 12:40:42 2015 UTC,"ARTICLE PAST PAYWALL:  UNITED NATIONS—Yemen’s warring political factions were on the verge of a power-sharing deal when Saudi-led airstrikes began a month ago, derailing the negotiations, the United Nations envoy who mediated the talks said.  Jamal Benomar, who spearheaded the negotiations until he resigned last week, told The Wall Street Journal the Saudi bombing campaign against Iran-linked Houthi rebels has hardened positions on a key point—the composition of an executive body to lead Yemen’s stalled transition. This will complicate new attempts to reach a solution, he said.  “When this campaign started, one thing that was significant but went unnoticed is that the Yemenis were close to a deal that would institute power-sharing with all sides, including the Houthis,” said Mr. Benomar, a Moroccan diplomat.  Mr. Benomar is scheduled to address the U.N. Security Council behind closed doors on Monday and report on the suspended political talks.  Most Yemeni political factions agree talks were progressing in the run-up to the Saudi air campaign, but their views vary on Mr. Benomar’s assertion that a deal was close.  This round of U.N.-brokered talks—which began in January and included 12 political and tribal factions—represented a crucial part of a mission to install a unified government in Yemen, the poorest Arab country and home to al Qaeda’s most dangerous offshoot.  The Houthi rebels, who have overrun significant parts of the country in the past eight months, had agreed to remove their militias from the cities they were occupying under the deal that had been taking shape. The U.N. had worked out details of a new government force to replace them, Mr. Benomar said.  In exchange, Western-backed President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who has since fled the country, would have been part of an executive body that would run the country temporarily, Mr. Benomar said.  The Houthis had agreed to that reduced role for Mr. Hadi until the Saudi military intervention began on March 26. At that point, the Houthis hardened their position on this key point and opposed any role for Mr. Hadi in government, Mr. Benomar said.  Saudi-backed factions have also hardened their positions, saying the Houthis shouldn’t be granted political power.  Several Yemeni political factions, which were also interested in power-sharing, said the military tensions in the capital led to feelings of unease during negotiations. In their takeover of the capital, the Houthis kidnapped members of rival political parties.  “We did not like the Houthi plan on the table, but we were willing to sign it since it reflected reality. It was either that or no deal,” said Mohammed Abulahoum, president of Yemen’s Justice and Building Party.  The air campaign transformed Yemen into a battlefield for a broader contest over regional power between Shiite Iran and Sunni countries led by Saudi Arabia.  The Saudis want to restore Mr. Hadi to the presidency and also support a separate armed political faction named Islah, which is anti-Houthi. Iran supports the Houthis, who abide by a Shiite offshoot of Islam. Many Yemenis accuse both countries of meddling in their affairs.  The Houthis took over the capital San’a and the government and then advanced on the south.As they approached the port city of Aden, where Mr. Hadi had taken refuge, he fled the country and ended up in Saudi Arabia.  Yemen’s troubles mark an abrupt turnabout from what the international community had once hailed as a success story.  The 2011 Arab Spring protests triggered political change in Yemen, a largely peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy. Groups that felt oppressed or excluded for decades under the former regime, such as the Houthis, were supposed to take part in the new government.  But that transition stalled in 2014. In the two months leading up to the Saudi air campaign, the Houthis and other parties insisted on a reduced role for Mr. Hadi, blaming him for the slow pace of reform.  Mr. Hadi, his Saudi allies and other political factions opposed the terms for the presidency being hammered out by Mr. Benomar.  “A very detailed agreement was being worked out, but there was one important issue on which there was no agreement, and that was what to do with the presidency,” Mr. Benomar said. “We were under no illusion that implementation of this would be easy.”  Two other Arab states—Qatar and Morocco—were willing to host new rounds of Yemen peace talks. But after both countries joined the Saudi-led military coalition, the Houthis rejected those venues, according to Mr. Benomar.  President Hadi has suggested that talks resume in the Saudi capital of Riyadh under Saudi auspices. But that was a non-starter for the Houthis.  A senior diplomat familiar with the negotiations said the Saudis also intervened to prevent a power-sharing deal that would include the Houthis and that would give 30 % of the cabinet and parliament to women.  Saudi Arabia declared last week that it was shifting to a new phase in the Yemen campaign more focused on seeking a political solution. But it left open the option of continued military action, and has kept up airstrikes at a robust pace since the declaration.  Mr. Benomar said he would tell the Security Council on Monday that only U.N.-led talks in a neutral location can have any chance of success.  On Saturday, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed of Mauritania was named as the new U.N. envoy for Yemen.  On Sunday, Yemeni officials reported several apparent strikes by the Saudi coalition against Houthi targets amid deadly clashes between Houthi militants and forces aligned with Mr. Hadi.  Strikes hit the capital San’a as well as targets in energy-rich Marib province, officials said. Several southern provinces also saw strikes, including one that hit a convoy of Houthi fighters heading to the southern port city of Aden."
YemeniCrisis,340ve2,Gladiator90,7,Mon Apr 27 13:52:28 2015 UTC,"This is EXACTLY why I fully rejected the interference of Saudi Arabia in yemen.   When the houthis went all the way to Aden, they faced little resistance from the south and other tribes- no one wanted any problems. Largely because the houthis were backed by the military of the ex president.   But Saudi Arabia realizing this quickly turned the south into a war zone when they started bombing yemen, this is when all the major fighting started. Therefore erasing any chances of a political deal.  I am more than sure a political decision could have been agreed upon between all factions if there was no bombing, or at least there could have been a chance. The key word is chance, but Saudi Arabia gave this no chance of happening.  If people are so naive to believe that Saudi's main goal was to restore legitimacy, they are dead wrong. Saudi's main goal was to protect Saudi. That's it. The first thing they bombed was the airports and military bases, and weapon depots. Clear as daylight. Removing any threat they felt from yemen from years past. This was there opportunity to do it and they did.  For people taking sides, I say it's a shame on you and yemen's problems will never be solved like that. Yet I understand it is much easier to view this from a good v bad point of view. But in reality all sides have legitimate grievances and have been stigmatized for many years especially the south and houthis. The only exception here is Ali saleh and his goons. There needs to be a new yemen where everyone is involved except the ex president and his close allies.  Anyways my point here was about Saudi Arabia and that today yemen would have been way better off without it's interference. Saudi is only looking out for themselves."

They were after Islah, the general who kept attacking them and they want a coalition government. It was Hadi who kept refusing. He had months to start a new government where Houthis finally get a real share of power.  Unfortunately for him his Saudi masters kept saying now. They were the ones who orchestrated his Presidency to keep the Houthis out of power in the first place. The Houthis attacked the South because Hadi was trying to start up a new government there and get international forces to invade Yemen. The Saudis launched air strikes because they didn't realise how fragile and very tenuous his support and rule is. It's been more than a month and Houthis still hold most of the places they captured.  I hope Hadi is happy. Whatever happens, his political career is dead. There is nothing the Saudis can do now to bring him back to power.

Abdilmalik Al Houthi doesn't care about Yemeni people, he cares about himself. If he really did care then he would stop attacking the south.   And Saudis know Hadi is done.
