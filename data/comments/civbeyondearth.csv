civbeyondearth,3e3pt4,GrooveMasterFunk,3,Tue Jul 21 18:47:04 2015 UTC,"The exact formula is unknown, but the rough mechanics are known:   Output is dependent on the raw output of both cities AND the Ratio of Food/Production between both cities.  The Ratio has a lot more influence than the actual output though The more productive City gets the Lion's share when it comes to production The same is true for food, but the game only counts overflow food (that's the number shown in the city view), not raw produced food - so a stagnant size 20 city does actually produce food for a new size 1 city if that size 1 city is growing Diminishing Returns exist somewhere in the formula, so the higher the numbers, the slower trade route yields grow   Overall, this means that for internal trade routes it's almost always a good idea to connect a BIG city and a SMALL city, so that the difference in productivity can generate a lot of yields for the bigger city. Which is one of the reasons why it's not a good idea to use the ""Auto-Renew Trade Route""-Feature during the early phase of the game, because your newest city will almost always be the best target for most of your internal trade routes (aside from the capital). That is especially true once that city has its recycler - the +1 production from trade routes is a flat bonus that is VERY strong to get a new city rolling. So quick-buying a recycler in new cities is extremely useful."

civbeyondearth,3dvcyd,draconon97,6,Sun Jul 19 20:56:18 2015 UTC,"No, that's not possible. Auto-Route will work most of the time as you've noted yourself, but that's about it.   In general I recommend doing it completely manually though, as a single worker connecting 2 cities will take a very long time, while 5-6 workers all ordered to build one tile each mean that your first city-connections are established very quickly, giving the rather strong 20% production boost a lot earlier than you would get it if you had only one worker slowly working his way from one city to the other.   Yes, it's rather annoying to time that perfectly, but the benefit is huge."

It just doesn't really have any storytelling weight and offers no real vision on the advancement of mankind. Each affinity, as well as the yet to be fully released Hybrid affinities, has some clear direction in which to improve the human condition.  A suggestion that I agree with would be to make an affinity that focuses on psionics. Its more of a convincing and powerful direction to take."
civbeyondearth,3dljp6,DefiantMars,2,Fri Jul 17 08:04:09 2015 UTC,I think I could make a story for it.

My protest is more along the lines if it not being powerful enough as a 4th Affinity and more the meditated Hybrid of all 3 base affinities. Its brings up issues of balance if it has low investment cost relative to the Base or even Hybrid Affinities.  Personally, I'd rather have a 4th ""Base"" affinity with Hybrids to a 3 way hybrid. But if you can swing it, more power to you."
civbeyondearth,3dljp6,DefiantMars,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:27:47 2015 UTC,What do you mean by not powerful enough?
civbeyondearth,3dljp6,Galgus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:36:16 2015 UTC,"I've been struggling to find the best way to explain this.  So right now we have 3 affinities and each have a clear direction for humanity.   Harmony: Incorporates alien genetics into humans, makes artificial lifeforms, and seeks to integrate itself into New Earth. Purity: Refines and perfects human genetics, engineers suits, battle platforms, and wants to shape New Earth in the image of Old Earth. Supremacy: Uses cybernetic augmentations and makes digital consciousnesses, creates robots and machines, looks to become detached from any one planet.   These are very clear and discrete drivers for technological and socio-cultural development. From a design standpoint, these are very singularly powerful elements and the juxtaposition (the observation of different elements in relation to each other) between them gives them their ""strength"", their ""story-telling power"", the spark that makes them interesting and compelling.    With the advent of Rising Tide, Firaxis have said that they are introducing 3 more affinities. Hybrids consisting of 2 of the base affinities combined. But Firaxis laid claims that they are their own identity not just a combination of 2. Right now, we only know 1 of them:  Purity/Supremacy   This is not just genetically improved humans that probably have augments and use machines to shape the planet. Instead this is Humans creating robots to serve them. While the other stuff may occur (we don't know yet), the focus is ""human masters and subservient machines"".    This gives this affinity its ""direction"" or to say in an inelegant way ""its gimmick"". With the new ones, all 6 affinities will have these reasons for what they're doing. With a 3 Way Hybrid I don't see the reasoning or compulsion behind it. When I say it lacks ""power"" this is what I mean. It feels more or less ""status quo"" to how we were on Old Earth and I feel doesn't offer anything new to the realm of affinities.     This is why instead I recommend a Psionic base affinity. This offers a plethora of opportunities for science fiction content, where as just mediating the 3 doesn't provide answers. Don't feel discouraged by my words; if you could figure something out, I will be greatly impressed."
civbeyondearth,3dljp6,DefiantMars,3,Tue Jul 21 23:08:44 2015 UTC,"Purity, in some interpretations, could be seen as wanting to create the perfect human with the goals and limitations that implies.  All the affinities have a spectrum of possibilities like that.    I posted my own affinity Discovery, before the game released if memory serves, focused on psionics and a desire to learn from the Progenitors ranging from wanting follow in their footsteps to almost worshiping them.  I've somewhat abandoned it due to not knowing how it would fit in the hybrid affinity system and preferring that system.    Your idea kind of sounds like a colony that tries to be as open as possible to the ideologies of each affinity.  They would never be trailblazers and would always end of playing catch-up in the technological frontier, but they may benefit from adopting what they find useful.  I'd dub it Diplomacy, though I'm not sure if a triple mix hybrid affinity really makes sense."
civbeyondearth,3dljp6,Galgus,2,Fri Jul 17 22:11:46 2015 UTC,"Purity, in some interpretations, could be seen as wanting to create the perfect human with the goals and limitations that implies.

I posted my own affinity Discovery, before the game released if memory serves, focused on psionics and a desire to learn from the Progenitors ranging from wanting follow in their footsteps to almost worshiping them. I've somewhat abandoned it due to not knowing how it would fit in the hybrid affinity system and preferring that system.   This proposes an interesting hypothetical of what adding a Psionic focus to the existing affinities would do."
civbeyondearth,3dljp6,DefiantMars,3,Fri Jul 17 22:22:29 2015 UTC,"I think its safe to say that Purity may have more knowledge of the human genome than any other affinity.    It would need to incorporate their desire to adapt some practices of the Progenitors as well, I think.  Would Purity/ Discovery hijack the Transcendence victory for a pure Human hivemind?  That would be rather disturbing, but I struggle to think of many ideas for hybrids.  I think at least hybrids should be kept to two - more than that gets so muddled that there just isn't a coherent theme."
civbeyondearth,3dljp6,Cbram16,2,Fri Jul 17 23:05:10 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree about Hybrids being a discrete combination of 2 Affinities. Hence my response to the OP. I think that there might be more of an Ascension victory where humanity is not restricted by the body, becoming energy beings.  I'd also rewrite the exact description of Transcendence to be less mindwipe-y."

Also remember to use ranged units more than melee when at war as ranged units do not lose health when attacking. A good ratio to remember 3:1 (ranged:melee). Early game use combat rovers over other melee units as they are very mobile and can easily swoop in to finish of units and cities, especially if you have roads. A big problem I see when I play with friends is that they prioritise the city over their units which is usually the wrong approach. Once you defeat all their units their cities are just sitting ducks, also if you aim their cities their units could easily just take back considering it stays on low health as you capture it.

civbeyondearth,3dcpze,Drake55645,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"I think health works fine the way it is right now. Early on you will drop into negative health, bu unless you go below -20 the penalties aren't really all that harsh. Expanding at a decent rate and staying above that number is perfectly possible, but reckless mass-expanding is somewhat prohibited by the decreasing productivity of lower health.   Growing Cities and constructing Health buildings to support the population is a solid foundation to then get back into positive health as soon as you reach the (global) health virtues of your choice - every tree has enough of them and for the most part they synergize rather well with how the virtues themselves shape the empire.   It feels a bit weird to be in negative health for the early game, but it also fits the theme of trying to establish oneself on a new planet and done properly, the health issues completely disappear in the mid-game. I actually think overall Beyond Earth does Health a lot better than Civ 5 did Happiness, as it's less restricting (for both, viable expansion locations and the overall shape of the empire) - if there's one complaint that I have then it's the fact that in longer games health becomes rather abundant later on.  Overall I'm not quite sure what ""tweaks"" you are hoping for, some more details wound be appreciated."
civbeyondearth,3dcpze,Yukiki,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:36:20 2015 UTC,"Okay I can't really assume when negative health is okay or not. I'm not that great at math, all I know is red is bad, and to be avoided.  If negative health isn't that bad, then it should be changed to yellow at moderate levels of negative health. If I've been needing to let health dip down this entire time and I've always assumed I was screwing up, I count that as a failure of the game to communicate that it wasn't the case.  I'm kinda mad now, to learn that negative health isn't bad. Why is it red?!  edit: Okay the tweaks I wanted? Some way to keep health above 0 without going culture focused purity. I had assumed that every other way of playing the game was horseshit because it would always dip under 0, and I took the hateful red number to represent that I was playing poorly.   On top of that, I preferred Civ5 where I could expand and conquer strategically to make sure I can sprawl out and still keep my empire happy.   Honestly all they need to do is change the health number indicator to be yellow until the point where I should be concerned, because balancing the benefits of new cities with new production and science that will be made in the future against the small percentile penalties that I will get starting now and going out... that's really hard to call when it's good or not."

civbeyondearth,3da7l9,runetrantor,4,Wed Jul 15 05:24:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I more meant that compared to the Wonders in Civ V, they give fairly unimpressive yields. For example, even inside SMAC, the Uranium Flats gives a similar energy yield to a tile with Solar Collector on it, less if you terraform right. But at the same time they managed to be these massive, fascinating landmarks on an alien world, so they were much cooler than the Natural Wonders in V and the, uh, nothing in BE.  They also tended to be massive stretches of multiple tiles, too, which meant that if you built a base in the Uranium Flats you could say hello to LOADSAMONEY.  EDIT; Minirant:  In particular, the wreckage of the UNS Unity and the special dialogue that appeared when you explored it was really thematic, and a little sad as you pick over the bones of a mission gone wrong.  But then again, Alpha Centauri also made more of an effort setting the scene; in SMAC you were part of a mission that was humanity's last great hope, with all the factions coming from one spaceship because that was all we could afford, and everything went wrong and sent the mission spiralling out of control and into space-despotism. In BE they don't make as much effort, and everyone turning up separately kind of removes the idea that you couldn't just jet off the planet again. In SMAC you literally find your smashed up spaceship and can SEE why you can't leave. In BE apparently they decided that immobile satellites that can only be launched within a few tiles of a base and that crash land in a few years were the pinnacle of science fiction technology. Nevermind that we have hovertanks and giant stompy robots, a space-station with a stable orbit is just TOO DARN HARD YOU GUYS."

We were an isolated technologically advanced paradise that ended up running the Planetary Council from our Island Lair of Indeterminate Location.

civbeyondearth,3cqfb3,Jinoc,13,Thu Jul 9 23:24:22 2015 UTC,"In physics, a quantum vortex is a defect that creates quantized magnetic flux in some type-II superconductors, observed only experimentally until a few decades ago. With the rapid advances in quantum computing and artificial intelligence forecast, colonial scientists have sought ever more powerful superconductors; one team of researchers theorized that the quantum vortex could be harnessed, and thus was created the first hyperconductor. In circumventing the Meissner effect, hyperconductors reduce electrical resistance to nil and negate electrical entropy to the point – theoretically – where data flow happens at translight speeds. Hyperconductors have other potential applications than hypercomputing; experiments in installing hyperconductors in robots, cyborg servomechanisms and mag-lev vehicles are currently underway.   It's not that difficult but is mostly nonsense.   The Church-Turing thesis states that any operation that is algorithmically compatible can be solved by a Turing computer; “hypercomputing” refers to models that are incompatible with Turing computation, involving non-Turing functions, primarily through the use of super-recursive algorithms. Hypercomputation was first introduced in 1999 AD on Old Earth, and has become a highly specialized pursuit in computer engineering since planetfall. The first functioning hypercore computer on this planet was built only a generation ago; using “fuzzy logic,” it was capable of having an oracle or advice function embedded in a polynomial-sized Boolean circuit;   Not very intuitive for someone with no training in mathematics (admittedly, a single BSc. is needed)   Exotic matter encompasses particles with physical properties that violate known laws of physics (such as having negative mass), chemical elements outside the periodic table, dark matter, and quantum states of matter (such as Bose-Einstein condensates and pentaquark baryons). All have the potential to serve as the basis for practical applications, although these are as yet only theorized. Using femtotechnology for exotic matter, it may be possible to create self-replicating molecular machines composed of nucleons rather than atoms. One possible application of such, since there are a finite number of excited states in nucleon bonding, would be the ready generation and manipulation of gamma rays without the usual degradation of other means.   All the words are familiar to people with an interest in physics, but the concepts are either nonsense or difficult. (e.g. ""since there are a finite number of excited states in nucleon bonding, would be the ready generation and manipulation of gamma rays without the usual degradation of other means"")  My favourite might well be   Although the concept was pioneered on Old Earth, after devising this “new” math, these scholars used it to create dimensional analysis whereby non-algebraic operations could be applied to a non-three dimensional equation to give meaningful results. In the process of such transcendental equations, transcendental numbers could be used as non-constant values in an algebraically closed field. While understood fully by only a handful of the most gifted mathematicians on this world, transcendental math led to advances in a number of theoretical realms, not the least the discovery of various pervasive, supra-dimensional messages. Currently using Liouville numbers, efforts at decoding these transcendental functions will no doubt take many more years.   which sounds like someone trained a neural net to generate mathsy-sounding paragraphs."

Some things are stuff you would not know unless you are an avid science fiction fan (which I am not), or just interested in science. The Transcendental Math mentions some interesting things:   Dimensional analysis is a real thing, but something you are already familiar with. How do you find the distance you'll travel given a rate and time? Dimensional analysis!  ""Algebraically closed field"" is just a definition for a case when the solutions of an equation could be expected based on the coefficients of an equation.  Fun stuff, take a look!"

Planetary Engineering/Seismic Induction: Pretty clearly has to do with large scale engineering on the planetary scale.  Honestly the vaguest is probably ""Social Dynamics"", but its obvious what it is getting at in the general sense.

Another would be Hutama in his Indonesian-Australia fusion nation for Beyond Earth.  The line up in my head looks something like this: Al Falah (Middle Eastern) - Another Private Organization (Corporation, NGO, or United Nations even) - Japan/Germanics - Surprise faction  So think out of the box. I've heard a lot circulating about a Caribbean sponsor (as a Cuban American, lo mereceriamos.) Another would be a confederation of Greek city-states (the New Delian League for those versed in history) as a sort of faction that has a cool city mechanic. My favorite idea I've had so far though, would be if the Native Ameircans rose after a splintered USA and the American Reclamation Corporation abandoned Earth for its space colonies. They'd be based around their plantations in the West of the country and who knows? Maybe they saved and incorporated American citizens left behind?  I don't know.

civbeyondearth,3cd4st,housen00b,7,Mon Jul 6 23:56:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, these bonuses stack, additive to be precise. So 2 Trade Routes mean a 100% Bonus-Growth (which is 50% reduced overall time).  However, only 1 tile can be claimed per turn and growth that goes beyond what is needed to finish the outpost goes to waste, so if you send 3-4 trade routes, then the effect will still have some minor diminishing returns, but these are almost neglectable.  So yes, sending multiple trade routes to an outpost is perfectly fine, and in can be a good idea to hold back some trade routes if you know you're going to throw down a new Expansion in a few turns - not only for the faster growth, but also to then send the trade routes to that level 1 city, as such a small city will provide great yields for the other cities and probably profit from a few hammers that will help it get its basic infrastructure quickly."

civbeyondearth,3cboof,Galgus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:14:46 2015 UTC,It it takes hundreds of years to build a granary. The game doesn't really respect time at all.
civbeyondearth,3cboof,Galgus,4,Tue Jul 7 20:21:53 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%. I don't even bother with other victories, because these changes from CivV make Domination so easy in BE. Hell, I get military upgrades for doing things like researching upgrades to my farms, which then spur further growth and tech upgrades. The whole ""Purity-farm-growth->Domination"" strategy is just ridiculously OP against the AI right now."

civbeyondearth,3c2zhg,KrazeeXXL,8,Sat Jul 4 07:13:10 2015 UTC,The order in which trade unit and fence were built doesn't matter. I can assure you that losing a trade unit definitely hasn't anything to do with triggering the quest as quest occurrence is random for each turn. Just make sure to have both (trade unit and fence) and send the trade unit on its way (this may be required). The quest sometimes may occur a couple of turns later. But it should occur nethertheless.
civbeyondearth,3c2zhg,Grogie,2,Sat Jul 4 09:35:27 2015 UTC,I haven't played since the update unfortunately but I thought it was just building the fence and having trade caravans researched?
civbeyondearth,3c2zhg,KrazeeXXL,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:59:49 2015 UTC,"Afaik, you need to have built at least one trade unit besides the fence. It may even be the case that you need to have established a trade route. But I'm not 100% sure about that."
civbeyondearth,3c2zhg,El_Barto_227,5,Sat Jul 4 19:23:05 2015 UTC,All building quests just need the building. Nothing else.
civbeyondearth,3c2zhg,Aea,2,Sat Jul 4 22:46:26 2015 UTC,I have gotten the quest without the trade depot. Maybe it's a poor strategy but I sometimes build the fence before the trade depot in my capital if I'm swarmed by aliens.

Mainly because I found the second turn with all the greetings to be highly annoying. (sometimes, when aborted too fast, it also screwed up leader audio).  The other point is the aggressive settling of the AI. With staggered starts, there's a bit more time to occupy those important choke points.  There's also a little diplomacy minus from civs towards oneself the later they started. But that's negligible. Personally, I find it more realistic that the civs don't arrive at the same time. But that's just my opinion."
civbeyondearth,3c1mao,KrazeeXXL,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:44:26 2015 UTC,"Mostly depends on what you want out of the game.   Staggered starts will not provide a ""balanced"" experience and the AI is really bad at stabilizing with very late starts. The bonuses that are granted to later starts also don't scale with difficulty settings, so an AI that starts very late on Apollo is basically doomed to fail. And of course you get the advantage of being able to scout half of the map and take all the Pods for yourself.  On the other hand, Staggered Starts create situations that normal starts usually won't and are nice to provide some interesting games.   I personally prefer disabling that option, but it's certainly nice to have."

Direct IP connections are great, as everyone can establish them to quickly create games without having the need to pay for additional servers. But they're vulnerable.

The upside is that aquatic cities generate more culture for virtues than land cities.     2) Leashing aliens hurts you proportional to the combat strength of an alien. You should be able to leash up to the Makara (28 combat strength) with the earliest leash tech. Later leash techs allow you to get units like the Siege Worm or the Kraken.     3) Artifacts are confirmed to unlock specific buildings that you can build empire wide using certain combinations. I wonder how many formulas there will be? I also wonder how many artifacts there will be on map, seeing as you'll need so many artifacts for certain combinations.     4) Certain buildings in water cities will enable them to move faster. That is -- they'll be able to finish the move project for fewer bolts/hammers.     5) Arshia Kishk's UA is confirmed to give increased yields on the special projects already in the game -- converting a larger percent of bolts/hammers into food/energy/science/culture depending on the project.     6) Progenitor Biome confirmed to have aliens get really pissed off easily and have them calm down more readily as well. There's certainly more to the new biome change.     7) More non-building quests. (Nazca lines thing isn't an expedition.)     8) Some stuff we could already have figured out by now, but seems apparent: For now, it appears as if Oceanic alien nests do not need to spawn on Xenomass. Also, no miasma on oceans?     9) Just like in Civ 5, a separate tech seems necessary to move onto ocean from the reef. This may just be for oceanic city movement however. It's unclear.     10) There are oceanic specific buildings. Maybe this means that some terrestrial buildings cannot be built in the ocean?     11) More stuff we could have already known: Minerals, Eggs, Chilonea (not sure how it's spelled), Shells, Deep Sea Vents confirmed as new basic resources on the ocean. More to follow certainly."

Some random notes from the stream:   The time to move a city is going to increase as a city gets more buildings. As soon as colonists can cross the sea, they can found ocean cities. Deep ocean is off-limits until you research the appropriate tech. These screenshots show the new assets for the ocean variety of farms and mines (previous screenshots were showing placeholders). The moving process is the only way for the city to gain more tiles, so there is going to be the tension between moving early (no immediate benefit but cheap) and moving late (slow but that's when you really want more tiles)."

civbeyondearth,3bojkd,tobascodagama,16,Tue Jun 30 21:40:22 2015 UTC,"With Rising Tide, our team is looking to expand the Beyond Earth experience in new ways. The goal was simple: take the game even further. What better way to do that than introduce a feature never before seen in any Civilization title: aquatic gameplay! The expansion’s Art Director, Todd Bilger, took some time to describe the process of creating the look of the Primordial biome while the Co-Lead Designer, David McDonough, described the new aquatic gameplay.  The Art of the Primordial Biome  Answered by Todd Bilger  What was the inspiration for the Primordial biome?  Todd: The original three biomes [Lush, Arid, Fungal] showed established alien worlds. These were planets that would remain unchanged for thousands of years. We played with this idea and wanted to show something completely different. The Primordial biome is a young and active world that’s still growing and forming into the planet it’s meant to be. It’s prime for volcanic activity and the climate is much more extreme than the standard planet. We wanted the Primordial biome to stand out, which we thought was going to be difficult because we already had a “hot” planet-type in the Arid biome. The key difference is the Arid is a stagnant and dry terrain. There’s a lot of desert and inactivity. The Primordial biome is rocky, parts of the terrain are black from the cooling lava, and there’s a lot going on under the surface of the planet.  How did you come up with the look for the Primordial biome?  The first part was constructing the shapes of the terrain. These shapes go a long way in describing the look and feel of this biome. We wanted the shapes alone to tell the player that this planet is in a constant state of growth and activity. The mountain ranges, for example, have a more violent upward push to them than the other biomes. We then did a color pass where we looked for characteristics that would tell the story of the planet. It’s always interesting to watch these abstract things like simple shapes and color create a story and an atmosphere. How is the Primordial biome different than any other biome from the base game? I think the theme of the Primordial biome is taken further than any of the biomes from the base game. The ice caps on Primordial maps are smaller. We did a lot of research into the kinds of plants that could survive this environment. You’ll see that detail in the biome’s shorter and fatter plants. The water, coastlines, and the plant life on the ocean floor all tie into these themes as well. What were the real world inspirations for the art style? Some of the most interesting research we did was looking at Earth plants and terrain from a microscopic level. When you look at something that close, it describes growth in a completely different way than what we see with the naked eye. This helped us imagine something far different than something we would have here on Earth.  Are the biomes from the base game getting updated?  They are and in a number of ways! We went back and tried to come up with new details that really complemented each biome’s atmosphere. Since we completely redid the look of the oceans for Rising Tide, each biome’s ocean has a very specific look. The aliens have also been changed to further define each biome’s atmosphere. We wanted players to feel like the aliens belonged to each biome. It’s similar to what we see on Earth. If you look at the animal life in a tropical forest, you’ll see a completely different range of color and textures than if you were in a desert.  What new feature in Rising Tide are you most excited about?  For me on the visual side it’s the look of the ocean. It was a big challenge to try and visualize the depth and character of each biome’s ocean. The ocean has always been flat in Civ and now all of a sudden we have to visually communicate a number of important features. It was definitely one of our largest hurdles, but we got the tech and team together and achieved something that we are incredibly happy with.    The Game Changer: Aquatic Gameplay  Answered by David McDonough  What made you guys decide to take Beyond Earth into the water?  David: It was an obvious opportunity too good to pass up. Aquatic gameplay is something historic Civilization games can’t easily do. But, it’s a perfect fit for Beyond Earth’s sci-fi theme and is a unique opportunity to push the strategy of Civ in a new direction. Outside of some custom scenarios, Civ has never had a 100% playable planet. The water has been a natural barrier between continents, and strategies are formed based on where the continents are. Everything is different when you can settle on any part of the map. For its thematic suitability and gameplay opportunity it was a great decision to pursue aquatic gameplay.  How does the aquatic gameplay change the game?  There are similarities in water and land gameplay, but they are different in some key ways. We wanted a level of familiarity so players would have an easy time integrating ocean cities into their established strategies. If you’ve played the base game, then you’ll have no trouble building an ocean colonist and settling them. On the other hand, there are a lot of new obstacles and opportunities specific to the ocean. There’s no terrain to stop your movement. Everything moves very quickly. Boats move fast. Cities can move around. Overall, gameplay at sea is a lot faster and more dangerous. The aquatic aliens also provide the player with new challenges. Aquatic aliens still have nests and a variety of forms, but their AI is set to do different things.  Is colonizing the ocean more difficult than land?  It’s a challenge in a different way. It’s no more difficult to get an outpost onto the ocean. There are no barriers to settling an ocean city or going between land and sea. But once you’re established on the ocean, you have to pay attention to different things to keep your city growing and safe. We’ve taken care to make sure ocean settlement is every bit as exciting and powerful as land settlement. We want players to be eager to explore their oceanic options and not be put off by it.  What are some of the things (units, resources, abilities) that only ocean cities can do or have access to?  There’s a whole catalogue of aquatic-themed buildings and wonders that only ocean cities can get. A lot of those have to do with improving the city’s movement or its attack and defense to make your city more like a floating fortress. There’s a whole set of aquatic resources that only occur at sea. The expeditions you can find at sea are very interesting. Players are going to find some weird things in the deep ocean.  What new feature in Rising Tide are you most excited about?  I’m most excited about water cities moving. Water in general is a collection of new gameplay features that I’m really excited about, but moving cities is number one on the list. It’s exciting to see players have to change their strategy. It almost hits them like a revelation. They start to think, “What can I do now that I move my cities around? What is the ocean like for me to play on with moving cities?” I’m very excited to see players explore this."

civbeyondearth,3bn24m,Jayschwa,16,Wed Jul 1 03:47:35 2015 UTC,"I have this nagging fear that the ocean building aspect is going to be a net negative rather than a positive.    Now it's true that without luxes or natural wonders, specific terrain is less important in BE than in Civ5, but still the general shape of the continents, terrain features/chokepoints, and strategic resources motivates the early-mid game expansion rush before the best territory is claimed by your rivals.  Once you go back and make the other 2/3rds of the planet (ocean) inhabitable, room to expand becomes much less scarce, the relative importance of terrain drops, and REX just turns drifts towards unfocused ICS.  This was the big issue I had with SMAC:AC, and unless they introduce new game mechanics to address it, then it's very likely to be an issue with BE:RT as well."

New aliens: the hydrocoral is basically just there to slow down oceanic expansion and the amphibious Makora will make coastal expansion a bit more tricky.   All three together should keep the expansion pace of Civ:BE fairly steady, even with the new tiles at your disposal."

The only requirements for a trade route between two cities of the same civilization are that there is only one trade between the two cities, that that at least one city (the city sending the trade route) have a trade depot, and that there be a possible route between cities (a non-miasma, non-mountain route for land, and a non-ice, fully explored path between two coastal cities for ocean.)"

civbeyondearth,3bgnwy,ShittyFrontPage,7,Mon Jun 29 01:41:01 2015 UTC,"This is a bug that occurs when 2 sponsors sign an agreement to declare war. There is no solution to solve the issue once it's happened, however, there are some semi-efficient methods that can be used to prevent it from ruining games.   The easiest being to have autosave enabled and once you get 2 sponsors declare war on you on the same turn you just load a savegame from a few turns before and instantly declare on one of the two factions - they can't make a deal anymore and the bug won't occur. You will be able to make peace later.  This is of course a bit of a dirty solution to the problem, but one that works. The only real downside is the global Diplomacy Penalty for declaring war, but that one is, if not done again and again, rather small and insignificant.  Another solution is just to be active diplomatically and trade other sponsors into war with each other. As long as they're busy on other fronts they won't make a deal against you. And when they hate each other they won't either."

civbeyondearth,3bgnwy,larknok1,0,Tue Jun 30 16:06:25 2015 UTC,"From what I recall of 2 AI DoWs, there is a leading AI aggressor who really hates you and got the other one to DoW you, and there is a passive AI aggressor who only moderately hates you and is forced by contract (10-15 turns) to war you. Once that time is up, as long as the second AI aggressor wants peace, you can have it with him.  In some respects, it's not a bug though. If the AI have an alliance together, they are of necessity always at war with the same individuals. As I recall though, there's a time-limit on possible peace declarations for that as well."

In CIV5 (and I imagine BE) if 2 people declare war together they're forced to fight for 10 turns on standard, but in BE they can never make peace. I've tested this myself by completely killing one civ and being able to make peace with the other on the next turn, and then loading an old save and doing it with the other civ. The CIV5 ai isn't the best, but this behavior definitely doesn't happen there and I'm not sure why it exists or if there's any work-around at all."

civbeyondearth,3bdbda,HerbHertz,2,Sun Jun 28 03:31:20 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I think that cities themselves do not have an anti-orbital strike. You can use the artillery units to perform anti-orbital strikes, but rocket batteries  are an improvement for the city increasing its combat strength and HP. If I remember correctly, you almost need to be positioned directly under a satellite to perform anti-orbital strikes. They may change this with the expansion, but no guarantees."
civbeyondearth,3bdbda,legolas12280,6,Sun Jun 28 10:14:12 2015 UTC,"No, cities definitely have anti-orbital capability.  Source: Attempted to use phasal transporters and was only able to send in one wave.  However, that range is exactly the same as artillery, so the orbital unit has to be directly above or immediately adjacent for the city to target it.  While it's infuriating when you're trying to deal with orbitals in your own territory, it makes sense for game balance - any more range than that and it would likely be impossible to have orbitals in place for any length of time, even if the AI's solar collector spam wasn't a factor."

civbeyondearth,3b9m6h,iMalinowski,2,Sat Jun 27 18:49:39 2015 UTC,Until they add more ship types the only thing to really do is sail around with a fleet early game. I typically don't explore with my gunboats until I have 3-4 . That way if you get caught out by a sea dragon you can kill it in 3-4 hits typically. Once you get some affinity levels you just crush all the aliens anyway.
civbeyondearth,3b9m6h,Catch_66,2,Sat Jun 27 19:17:43 2015 UTC,If you use boats as long range attack units they become very powerful through earned unit upgrades. They will take out sea dragons in 1 hit easily.

When necessary, three Gunboats focusing down a Sea Dragon can kill it in one turn but you need to spot it, surround it, and attack it all in one turn to be successful.  Also, just a tip in case you had not yet noticed, but Krakens cannot enter coastal water tiles so you can safely kill them even with Gunboats provided you stay in coastal waters."

Groups of small warships, or small groups of major warships, might instead be designated flotillas by some navies according to their terminology.

For $15.40 USD (I don't know what your local currency is) I think it's a good buy if you already know you like strategy games and/or the Civilization series in specific.  That said, the game is definitely on the Firaxis model of putting out something somewhat bare but workable and then improving it into the stellar territory through expansions. Civ4, Civ5, and XCOM all did the same thing and the expansion due for BE later this fall is looking to be very good. Beyond Earth will be fun right out of the box, but if I had limited free time and had to make a choice between BE and other games I would wait for at least this expansion to get a more complete experience."

Titanium early is imba.  You need about ~7 cities or so to win. You can do it with 4 or 5 but you have to really know what you are doing and spam academies.  You used to be able to win by spamming farms. Then they nerfed the wonder that gave them +1 food, and I'm not sure you can do that any more.  Negative health is not great, but it is not the catastrophe it was in other games. Although it starts to really hurt if you get down to -10 or -20.  The tech web is cool. You no longer march down a (more or less) linear research path. You will not research everything by the time you win. You won't even research half of everything.  I don't know if Harmony has the easiest win condition, but I do know it has the one that requires the fewest clicks.  Purity has all sorts of military units that you never need to build because of dragoons (their tanks) and battle suits (one of their purity only affinity units).  Satelites/the orbital layer bring a neat new dimension to BE that you won't use in half of your games because you don't have oil.  Ignore the whining naysayers that bitch about this game.

civbeyondearth,3b7ef5,Invictus227,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:58:41 2015 UTC,Right. Totally agree.
civbeyondearth,3b7ef5,andreipoe,2,Fri Jun 26 16:59:59 2015 UTC,"You can do it with 5, I just find it easier to win with 7 to 9 cities as opposed to 5. I like 7, you can settle 7 by turn 80 or so. Unhealth does get ugly in the mid game, but there's a bunch of options to mitigate that as time goes on.  But I play AU, which pretty much means you are going to be at negative health for the majority of the game.  This is all before the last patch, though. Since then I've played three games. Lost 1, won 1, quit 1 because an early war was shaping up to be annoying whether I won or lost and I didn't feel like slogging through it."
civbeyondearth,3b7ef5,burrowowl,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:05:37 2015 UTC,"I like the game, but it still isn't as refined as Civ V. Then again I never played V till all the expac's where out so that may be the reason.  Either way diplomacy needs a huge overhaul in CivBE, its garbage, and favors are the worst thing ever since now all the AI does is exhaust their resources and beg you for yours with favors. Then the favors are worthless because they don't sway their opinion of you much and they never have anything worth using favors on except maybe a little science if you happen to have a cooperation agreement. And God forbid you turn down a request because they will ally with someone they were just at was with 2 turns ago but shun you. (Yes this has happened to me)  I love the sci-fi part of the game, but damn I miss Civ V diplomacy."

civbeyondearth,3b7ef5,SimpleFactor,5,Fri Jun 26 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about health too early, going down to -5 really isn't too bad I find. Try to focus settling near 1 of the 3 major late game resources (Faraxite, floatstone and xenomas) but still try and have access to multiple ones as late game its really nice to have some to trade for A LOT. Don't be agro to the aliens either. Leave them alone and life becomes a lot easier.   Also think of a tech plan before hand. Don't just go straight for the tech required to push your victory forwards and don't feel you need to focus on the techs that give you the right affinity, there are so many good techs which upgrade other affinities and are too good to miss. Saying that however don't go all over the place. Getting maybe 4 or 5 levels in the other affinities combined is ok, but too much starts to really hurt your victory progress.   The virtue system is brilliant but only if you use it well. I tend to focus on prosperity for the health benefits further down, but unlike Civ V working on all of them is usually the best way to go. Even though people may class them as combat, growth, science and production the lines are actually a lot more blurred. Like in the might tree, theres a virtue which advances your affinity progress every tech which is amazing for any type of victory but you need t get through a few of the military xp virtues first! (note you also get rewarded for going for multiple ones, so hover over the icons on the sides of the rows/columns to see how you should arrange things to get the most e.g free virtues)  Finally go wide! Going tall really isn't too much of an option in BE so be prepared to have a lot of cities and a lot of workers to improve everything! Its vital you try and stay on god terms for as long as possible with your neighbours as everyone wants to expand as much as you do and go wide. Settling islands off the coast is usually a good idea too, but be prepared for the late game denouncing and wars due to the different affinities people go for! (believe me, either you have the same affinity as another player or your about to go to war!) (note sending a trade convoy to a growing city is really good, as you can actually get it to city status a lot faster and start production. The convoy automatically resets one its a city)"

I've noticed that health is easy to maintain once you get biowells (improvement that gives +1 health) and you can build cities everywhere if you want.  I'd make at least 7 if you have room for them.  Naval ships are much weaker than in civ to melee combat.  As are the ranged units.  Don't let melee units hit them.  It's harder to take cities early game because no 3 range artillery.  Don't piss off aliens too much early game.  Build a supersonic fence to keep aliens out and then you get the option to protect your trade routes.  do this.

The theme of the game is the story of settling on the chosen planet, and settling on multiple worlds would weaken that theme.  Its just such a different theme that it belongs as a different game, or perhaps a scenario set in such a second wave of expansion.  This is what Starships is/ could have been, as much as I'd prefer it to have been Sid Meier's: Pirates! in space    The furthest I'd go with this would be gaining resources from other worlds in the earliest new world extra-planetary efforts while keeping all micromanagement on the planet."

civbeyondearth,3atthw,boxtears,24,Tue Jun 23 13:30:54 2015 UTC,"If I had my say on Stations, I would focus on the good, potentially fun parts of them, and ignore the stupid, annoying parts of them:  1) I would remove the 3 tile radius requirement completely. You should be able to pop a city right next to the damned things and surround them with your borders. The annoying part of Civ 5 City States was that they took up land, annoyed you, swapped hands easily, and were just genuinely a nuisance on the map that you couldn't afford to remove.  2) Give stations unique abilities that you can activate through interaction with the station. At the moment, stations are occasionally useful trade partners, but very rarely are they anything more. I'd like them to be a unique tile on the map that does interesting stuff.  Imagine this: The station Stet Mining plops down, and you settle next to it. You open up diplomatic relations with Stet Mining and they demand a trade route to them to open up more advanced diplomatic options. Once you've done that, you can open up a quest menu with the station with a list of things they'd like accomplished, alongside a number of diplomacy points you'd earn for each quest accomplished. Then you can spend those points on things unique to the station. 2 points might grant 2 or 3 production in a target city for the next ten turns. 6 points might grant +3% to +5% production in a target city until the end of the game. 10 points might be a global one-time empire purchase such as making manufacturies only give 1 unhealth.  This is just a brief glimpse into what Firaxis could do with Stations."

Imagine Isaac Asimov's landmark sci fi series Foundation, except instead of the clash of civilizations plotlines with military, religious, and economic interplanetary domination, Hari Seldon sits around deciding whether to send a trade convoy for 2 food and 4 production or for 3 food and 3 production."

So that just kicked in as ""stock answer"" regarding something where they haven't done as much yet.  On the other hand, stations have received no love in patches, so there's a decent chance that they actually think the underlying design is doing its job (but, to be fair, the idea isn't terrible, just the execution is)."

At launch each city could start out with 3 trade routes, now you're stuck with one until your city reaches 10 pop, plus you can set them to auto-renew. Trade routes really aren't a thing."
civbeyondearth,3atthw,jeremyhoffman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:57:48 2015 UTC,"Trade routes are absolutely a thing. Sure, you can auto-renew trade routes now (and accept the suboptimal returns), but they're still a thing. You can automate Workers too, but Workers are still a thing!  And with the new system, I have to constantly check whether any of my cities have reached 10 population and it's time to build another trade unit. A trade convoy is extremely cheap and gives higher yields than most buildings, so if you're putting in even the slightest effort to play well, you want to have the full number of trade routes running at all times.  Even if you try to do the bare minimum and ignore trade routes, sometimes your station trading partner will be destroyed, or if you use the option to accelerate growth of an Outpost, the Outpost will finish becoming a City and you'll have to reassign the unit.  Compare that to how much I interact with rival civ leaders. Maybe a couple times a game one of them asks for my excess Xenomass or asks me to declare war on someone else I don't care about, or sign a meaningless Pact of Cooperation. There is just no reason to care what any of them are doing (except for direct military conflict). There's no trading for luxuries, there's no research agreements, there's nothing. Honestly Civ Beyond Earth could have been the human player's civ vs. the planet instead of vs. other civs, and probably been a better game, that's how uninteresting AI civs are. (Note that base Civ 5 had a lot of these same problems at release.)"
civbeyondearth,3atthw,StrategicSarcasm,0,Wed Jun 24 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, obviously trade routes still exist, but they're not ""a thing"" in that you spend all your time thinking about them. With how impossible it is to keep up your Health without luxuries and how much health penalizes growth, it's easy for you to have fewer trade routes at most points than the equivalent points in Civ V. They're really not a big deal.  As for trading with civs, there are plenty of things you can do that you glance over. Luxury trading is largely replaced with Strategic resource trading, where in Civ V it was difficult to have any strategic resource besides Uranium stay relevant for more than an era. Research Agreements are largely replaced with trading science, which has a lot of the same principles but is harder to run away with. Every time I play I find myself caring more about the AI than in Civ V."

civbeyondearth,3arqf0,androsgrae,2,Tue Jun 23 14:53:14 2015 UTC,That whole list sounds great.  I wouldn't mind a sponsor from each of those categories.  Plus you could easily think of their associated bonuses.
civbeyondearth,3arqf0,detectivekr,2,Tue Jun 23 18:06:10 2015 UTC,"I think its up to us to decouple the attachment of Civ and Sponsor. Most of the sponsors are culturally and regionally based. That does not mean they are totally representative of their geographic origins. I still refuse to accept the ARC as the be-all-end-all of Northern America as with the Commonwealth of the Pacific/Polystralia. ARC may be located in America, but it is a corporation. With the original 8 sponsors, much of the world is still unrepresented and I agree that the absence of the more private sector is a bit odd. Though its seems they were going for the emergence of these culturally identifiable powerhouses out of the political turmoil of the Great Mistake.   Not so ironically, you've outlined many of the archetypes present in Alpha Centauri. I feel that the modding community has done a great job with exploring many of those backgrounds. It would be incredible to see the same mentality manifest in the base game though."
civbeyondearth,3arqf0,DefiantMars,3,Tue Jun 23 22:42:59 2015 UTC,"That does not mean they are totally representative of their geographic origins. I still refuse to accept the ARC as the be-all-end-all of Northern America as with the Commonwealth of the Pacific/Polystralia.   The problem is that this is, in a way, too subtle to be expressed easily without adding more exposition. I like the idea and think it can actually give a sponsoring organisation a lot more grounding in our world by localising them but the way it's presented in-game, it's too much space-France, space-South America, space-US and so on.  Which really is a missed opportunity: by making ARC more explicitly corporate, Brasilia more explicitly military, Franco-Iberia more explicitly nation-sponsored, you could actually get a much better glimpse of post-mistake Earth and its politics and who are the movers and shakers there."
civbeyondearth,3arqf0,WhatGravitas,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:15:09 2015 UTC,"I fully agree, I just hadn’t realized that so many people had ""boxed"" sponsors as such.  Though that begs the question; how would you make the variety of sponsors explicitly recognizable to their flavor or archetypes in mechanical and aesthetic ways. Aside from revamped dialogue (which I really would like to see) where would you see these societal differences being distinguished? I don't mean this in any antagonistic way, at all. I'm genuinely curious and want to see this game improve.  By compounding the leader’s character and sponsor history, I myself got a feel for what they were. But it doesn't make itself totally apparent. You (general you) get a glimpse of these things with the Leader text, but unless you either “make it up in your head” or read the Pedia, it is not clear. There are also glaring issues were even this characterization becomes lost as the affinities progress.   Suzanne is clearly corporate but this shifts to this imperial feeling Romanesque flair. Daoming Souchua is one model that actually confuses me real bad. Given her background as a genius level expert on “electrical engineering, nano-electronics, nuclear physics, and bubble fusion”; I would expect her to be much more inclined to her representations in Starships. Sleek and optimized. Kozlov's jump from ""flight-suit"" to commander's regalia is off putting, doesn't make sense with his ""working-man"" background and pays no heed to affinity differences.   These are not bad designs overall, but they do not do justice to the differences in affinity and sponsor background. As it is right now, overall affinity progression is merely a palette swap. All of this is very much disappointing as I do not see the same affinities playing out with the different sponsor backgrounds. I doubt that Kavitha's Harmony would wind up looking the same as Bolivar's Harmony for example.  Now bringing it back to the intent of this Original Post. I’m hoping for some form of Ecologist group; a scientific, green minded, NGO. I’d also like to see some form of “builders guild” typology. An organization comprised of Civil Planners, Engineers, Architects, Craftsmen, etc from around the world. A society of “Design, Engineer, Build”. Part of issue with representing either of these is that you only see one face, the sponsor’s representative. You’d only meet one person, which invokes the same kind of issue with Elodie. :("

civbeyondearth,3arqf0,Hobbes___,2,Tue Jun 30 14:45:23 2015 UTC,I think what is needed is also a group of explorers and pioneers. All the sponsors so far use the whole thing as a lifeboat to escape failing Earth.  It'd be very much in line within the whole optimism-vibe Civ:BE has to have one sponsor driven by curiosity and sense of adventure. Perhaps even sponsored by a private group on Earth to distinguish them more from the nation/corporation-driven sponsors.

civbeyondearth,3albd3,monkwren,2,Sun Jun 21 14:00:34 2015 UTC,"yeah i got the game yesterday, what do those do?  you trade with them, and do they grow over time and give you more yields?  The measly +4 yield barely justifies a route with them"
civbeyondearth,3albd3,lax_br0,3,Sun Jun 21 21:18:29 2015 UTC,"They do grow over time in the yields, and there is a virtue that give you energy increases per station level - they can be pretty lucrative."
civbeyondearth,3albd3,Manannin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:08:25 2015 UTC,Alternative Markets. 18 ept from them.
civbeyondearth,3albd3,El_Barto_227,15,Sun Jun 21 22:12:51 2015 UTC,"First off I, and everyone else, agree with you that Diplomacy and the AI needs improvement.  I also agree that diplomacy backgrounds, evolving with affinity, would do much to make the leaders more interesting.  Beyond Earth has a great aesthetic and theme to it, but largely its potential is wasted.  In my opinion emphasizing and expanding the importance of existing mechanics like quests and Aliens would really help the game.  Making new mechanics to tie into the game's themes would be harder, but it would bring out the game's true potential.  So this is what I would like to see.    Threatening Aliens    Prior to release the Aliens were advertised as a truly dangerous entity to anger, but they tend to be tamer than Barbarians.  To start, removing Ultrasonic Fence from the game would prevent players from negating them as a threat.  Destroying Alien Nests would now grant a substantial food boost to the nearest city rather than Energy, making more sense logically and making them a better target.  Continuing this trend, the Survivalism Might virtue now grants food in the nearest city based on the combat strength of slain Aliens.  Clearing miasma or forests would attract Aliens and make them locally more aggressive similarly to how proximity to a Nest or a recent attack does.  I would make hostile actions against them generally anger them faster, with destroying Nests being enough to instantly make them very hostile.  Hostile aliens will now swarm cities, creating scenarios where players will truly need to fight for survival.  To help defensive players out, hostile actions within one's own territory anger the Aliens half as much, Siege Worms and Kraken take twice the aggression to shift to each hostility stage, and both of them have a longer delay before spawning.  Altogether these changes would make a soft warmongering tactic of riling up the Aliens more viable, and make conflicts with the Aliens more impactful.  To tie into more dangerous Aliens, resource pods could require an expedition and be made much stronger.    Biome based threat and resource modifiers, Multi-Biome maps, and three new Biomes    Firaxis has announced vague plans for Biomes to effect gameplay, but this is how I would do it.  Biomes now influence basic resource quantities and locations, as well as terrain features and layouts.  Each Biome also has its own tweaks to the quantity of small and/or large Aliens and their locations, giving them unique threats.  Maps can now include multiple Biomes, with the locations of different Biomes determined by semi-random map generation weighted by fitting map locations for them.  Tundra biomes are mineral rich frozen wastes with small clusters of forest.  Volcanic biomes host dangerous, but magma energy-rich ashlands around volcanic mountains with lush forests in the distance.  Swamp biomes are rich in rivers and marshlands overrun by aliens and miasma with small, safer hill zones.    Quest Overhauls, New Quests and Station Quests    Frankly, I think we could use more quests that require some form of interaction, with more unique, fun, and worthwhile rewards.  They can also be made to be far more relevant in Affinity accrual, making it less strictly tech reliant.  Some of them may stir the pot of international relations, leading to conflicts over affinity and control of Progenitor Ruins.  Station quests allow you to either side with them for a trade boost, destroy them for a large one-time boost, or capture them for an enhanced city.  Stations also impede city expansion far less than they used to, though they each come with their own potential downside.    Natural Wonders with Affinity Quest Decisions    A list of, currently, six Natural Wonders for Beyond Earth that can be developed in affinity-specific ways.  This adds a bit of story to how your colony interacts with them while mechanically helping them scale to the mid-late game.    Federations: Formal Alliance system and Victory condition    Federations are essentially formal alliances where colonies in the same federation vote on matters of war, peace, federation leader, and alien relations.  If you are the leader of a federation that includes all colonies that still retains their capitol city, you win after a countdown.  The faction leader sets a minor bonus that is shared by all federation members, but as a downside for joining federation members gain increased spy effectiveness against their federation allies.  Breaking from and spying within federations can have diplomatic consequences, adding weight to joining, betraying, and leaving them.  Though it is not the only factor, they form easier along affinity lines.  With them, true world wars may become more commonplace, and you may find several disgruntled AI's team up against you if you near victory.    Devotions System: Making Affinity far more impactful on your colony.    This is my biggest, most impactful proposal.  I hate how Affinity choice is far less influential on ones's colony than Ideologies were in BNW despite being central to the game's theme.  With this system, unlocked primarily with Culture and secondarily with Science and gated by affinity level, Affinity choice will have an outright massive impact on your colony.  Harmony colonies become the most populous with massive growth, health, and expansion bonuses. While other Affinities live on the planet, Harmony truly thrives on it.  Purity colonies are culturally focused, converting cultural output into other yields. They focus on building a utopia for humanity, and are encouraged to mix Terrascapes into their tiles.  Supremacy colonies become industrial juggernauts, eventually substituting food for energy and production to grow their cities. They are also the strongest specialist affinity with their augmentations.  Each of the hybrid affinities have their own trees and their own themes.    Fleet Expeditions: The beginnings of multi-planet empires.    This is essentially a late game system that provides powerful trade routes from early post-Earth colonization efforts, mining operations, and research voyages.  Players must secure ample amounts of Energy, Titanium, and Geothermal resources to construct and defend expeditionary fleets and the military fleets to guard and raid them.  Military fleets consist of current air units assigned to them and new Capital ships: powerful units that are extremely expensive to construct and repair.  Massive trade yields and pillaged energy await players who fully utilize this system.  Important note - this system is kept entirely planet-centric to not disrupt the theme of Beyond Earth. Players will not be managing new colonies on other planets.    New Victory Conditions    I think Firaxis has already said they won't be doing this, but I think it would help strategic diversity and immersion.  Every Affinity/ sub affinity combination receives its own victory conditions with its own - to the extent of my imagination - unique challenges.  All in all, this makes for 9 Affinity victory conditions, for a total of 12 ways to win including Contact, Conquest, and Federations.  This also helps explore the dynamics and goals of a colony based on its affinity while allowing immersion seeking players more options.    Bonuses that shut off while unhealthy to help Tall Colonies    To help Tall empires, specifically in the expansion phase where colonies tend to become unhealthy, stronger Sponsor bonuses, some virtues, and passive growth bonuses could be disabled when in red health.    Extra Idea - Possible Fourth Affinity    Less of a true suggestion, the Discovery affinity focuses on a potential reaction to the Progenitors where they are seen as an enlightened elder raise to be followed and emulated - culturally, scientifically, and genetically.  Research on the Progenitors leads to a psionic theme, largely focused on debuffs and somewhat experimental equipment that works best at full health in combat.  It doesn't truly fit the theme as well as Beyond Earth's excellent Affinities, but it qualifies as a philosophy and response to what was found on the planet that shapes a colony's development."
civbeyondearth,3albd3,Galgus,11,Sun Jun 21 21:41:18 2015 UTC,"Great post and good initative. I haven't played myself since 2 weeks after the release. I'm still waiting for the game to be more or less completely polished. Just like Civ5 when it came out, it sucked. Alot. So it's very nice to see that there are still some people fighting for it and not just giving up, waiting, like me. Keep it up!"

civbeyondearth,3albd3,CptBigglesworth,3,Mon Jun 22 07:44:33 2015 UTC,"Civ5 was probably the technically most polished and impressive Civ title at start... but I really felt like the game pace was glacial, it took ages to build anything, meaning a lot of the game was on ""auto-pilot"", especially coming from Civ4.  With G+K (and the patches), it really turned into what it is now (and, to me, the best Civ title to date)."
civbeyondearth,3albd3,WhatGravitas,6,Mon Jun 22 19:13:06 2015 UTC,"You're right with pretty much every point but the last. You CAN play tall -- doing it very well just requires you to do specific things like play Purity, Africa, knowledge + industry combo, and gun it to building nanopastures with a free tech from your institute.   moreover -- I can assure you that there are faaaaar more ways to play than just Prosperity. After 200 hours i finally have great builds that can use all of them. In fact -- prosperity was the last virtue branch I incorporated into my play. Also -- there are TONS of non-affinity techs that can be more important than affinity ones.   From having been where you are -- your inexperience is talking more than the game on ""one way to play."" I know it can really feel like that -- but you have to step out of your comfort zone and try new things and new combos to get the most out of beyond earth"
civbeyondearth,3albd3,larknok1,3,Sun Jun 21 12:39:53 2015 UTC,"Here's a list of a few unique strategies you can try:   1) Focus Might only and speed your way to a huge early army. Get the virtue that let's you convert enemy outposts to yours and secure a powerful lead early.   2) 5 in knowledge + anything else: pick up early science from tons of expeditions plus get 10% more culture and have virtues cost 15% less, then pick a secondary virtue branch based on what you need. Might: extra military power + fast affinity levels. Industry: energy,  production, health (tall empires). Prosperity: rapid growth,  health (wide empires)."
civbeyondearth,3albd3,larknok1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:51:27 2015 UTC,"I do feel that prosperity is the strongest though. This design choice makes me a little uncomfortable. It seems to me that not choosing prosperity requires ignoring unhealthiness. I'm not really happy about that, but I'd be overjoyed to learn other strategies if you want to share them...   I know it can really feel like that -- but you have to step out of your comfort zone and try new things and new combos to get the most out of beyond earth   We don't have much strategy discussion for beyond earth, either here or on /r/CivStrategy"
civbeyondearth,3albd3,I_pity_the_fool,6,Sun Jun 21 13:08:44 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing I realized long ago about Prosperity: Many of the things it offers are easily done in some other way.  First of all, the worker virtue just doesn't matter. Honestly, a virtue just isn't worth a second worker if you intend on getting Machinery. It's a one-time four or five turn saver that doesn't have a lasting effect into the late game like almost all the other virtues do.  Next, the free colonist is good. That's obvious. The important question you have to ask yourself is if it justifies ignoring every other virtue tree, because starting with any virtue tree that isn't Knowledge dedicates you to more or less only that virtue tree.  As far as health goes, here's the breakdown: Your empire generates two kinds of unhealth: local (population existing) and global (unhealth improvements, cities existing). You can completely counteract local unhealth with health buildings and biowells and it's not much to worry about. Global unhealth is what you have to worry about. To deal with that, you have two tools: first, acquire tons of spies and just wait until mid to late game while working the health national security project. Second, virtues. Here's the virtue breakdown:  Might offers 1 health option. Prosperity offers 4 health options. Knowledge offers 1 health option. Industry offers 2 health options.   Let's do a thought experiment to show how you can deal with unhealth using Knowledge + any other tree. Let's assume you can deal with local unhealth easily. The issue is dealing with global unhealth. The great majority of global unhealth comes from every city existing generating 4 global unhealth. If you have an empire of say -- 6 cities, averaging at population 8, that's 24 global unhealth to deal with. You start with 9 global health. That leaves 15 unhealth. The knowledge virtue alone will give you 8 from your population. That leaves 7 unhealth to consider. Let's use Industry in addition to Knowledge. Industry's first health policy gives 0.5 global health for each trade route. Let's assume 3 of our cities have population 10+ and can house 2 trade routes. Then that's 4.5 additional health, leaving only 2.5 unhealth left. If you then pick up Magnasanti or go for an army of spies for health, that's at least another 15 global health in each situation. With both, that's like positive 30 global health -- and both Magnasanti and the spy army will scale exponentially as you enter the late game.  That's just to give you an idea how manageable health is without prosperity in the hands of someone who understands the game.  So health removed -- what does prosperity offer? A few token free units early, the ability to create many cities quickly, a tiny bit of extra production on basic resources, the 10% carry over opening virtue, and the 10% growth synergy. That makes it good -- but by no means the ONLY virtue that you can play with, or even obviously the best."
civbeyondearth,3albd3,larknok1,2,Mon Jun 22 02:48:36 2015 UTC,Excellent post. Thank you.
civbeyondearth,3albd3,I_pity_the_fool,3,Mon Jun 22 09:23:22 2015 UTC,"I also agree about Prosperity being the strongest virtue. Yes, other virtues are good... but not ""free city, free worker, free health"" good."
civbeyondearth,3albd3,monkwren,2,Sun Jun 21 14:00:17 2015 UTC,"I think the question should not be what should be improved but what should be totally changed, the game feels like civ 5 and even the devs said they didn't take enough risks.    for example, specialists. why cant I build a city which doesn't take a step outside. I get my food from growers, energy from reactor workers ect ect ect. and make it viable from the start, not once you get X techs and Y virtues.   I would rather see natural wonders go back to smac's landmarks. this could be X 5 geothermal or any resource really / a circle of tiles with +1 resource. I like this more than one strong tile because it takes higher pop city to take advantage of, unlike civ 5 where you could just put down your settler and get a huge boost in the early game.  Basically without going on and becoming one of the many QQ posts(a few were mine) in this sub Reddit, this game was sold as a full stand alone game, full priced and not ""hey its space civ 5, you guys just wanted a reskin... right?""."
civbeyondearth,3albd3,ilikecchiv,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"There should be an outer ring tech to allow that sort of city, that doubles the yields of specialists and reduces the unhealth of specialists to 50%. Otherwise, the specialists just don't compete with the yields of even desert tiles, as improvements are increasingly powerful  (which is one of the big successes of BE: amazing diversity of buildable  terrain improvements)."
civbeyondearth,3albd3,Manannin,2,Sun Jun 21 22:14:52 2015 UTC,"One of my biggest complaints is that the gameplay is very ""flat."" All of the buildings give flat bonuses.  There are no percentage multipliers. There is no reason to specialize. Having a Copper may be worth one extra science with the right building. Big whoop. Compare that to Civ 5, where Marble gives a city +15% protection for wonders and Iron allowing a Forge that gives +15% production for land units. Remember Civ 4's National Wonders? You'd have one city with double gold production and another would get +1 specialist per forest file or whatever.  Meanwhile, every couple of turns, the game interrupts me to ask whether some building I have in one of my cities should make one extra science or one extra energy. Yaaawn.  I can't help but compare Civ BE to Endless Legend. A mid game tech in EL can increase your max army size from four units to six units. This is a huge game changer and critical for winning tactical battles. Late game building in EL give massive exciting bonuses, like +30 dust and +20% dust in the city, or +2 science per city tile. In Civ BE, a late game building gives... +4 Health. Or +20 city strength and +20 city hitpoints. Or, most befuddling of all, four Grower specialist slots. Yawn."
civbeyondearth,3albd3,jeremyhoffman,2,Sun Jun 21 19:49:13 2015 UTC,"This is great.  I really hope the devs read this.  I got the game yesterday and played it.  1500 hours of civ v has shown me what is really great about it, and with my 10 hours of BE so far, I've noticed mostly what you've seen.  Leaders need WAY more characterization, they should evolve with their affinity.  and yeah wtf happened to great people, golden ages, and specialists?  The specialist slots suck now, because they don't give points to great people.  I have no reason to work a 2 food specialist slot haha.  Wonders are underwhelming.  The only few that really gave me a boost were the free maintenance and +1 movement for workers wonder, and 1 or 2 others.  The rest aren't worth the production.  I also thought that some buildings required too many strategic resources.  Yeah the small production boost is great, but I'm not paying 2 or 4 firaxite to build this building.  They need to make strategic resource requirements for buildings lower."
civbeyondearth,3albd3,lax_br0,2,Sun Jun 21 21:16:58 2015 UTC,"The alien ecosystem seems less integrated together. A miasmaphobic alien silk sounds really cool, but the reason why it doesn't exist is the legacy of an cooperative alien fungus-planetmind from SMAC, but CivBE really fails to incorporate the Planet as a living thing like that. It feels more of a sort of ecosystem that doesn't directly compete with itself (and thus a miasmaphobic silk doesn't exist) but it doesn't seem like it should cooperate. The barbarians and aliens never fighting amongst themselves always felt half-baked to me. I want to trick the Picts into attacking the Gauls so my Legion can crush them."

civbeyondearth,3alr0w,Skeldal,6,Sun Jun 21 13:35:30 2015 UTC,"Why not have quests where you make hard choices between two bad things   Firaxis has talked about this before (although I'm not sure where), and they don't like forcing players to choose between two negatives or, worse, having a negative effect as a result of playing the game normally (the example they gave was pollution in Civ 3, which arose out of your cities having too much production or something). I can see their point--it's hard to play SimCity/Empire when you're constantly trying to fight back all the consequences or you're being forced to choose between the lesser of two evils. Of course, a properly balanced system would have options to counteract the consequences of your choices, but at that point it negates itself anyway, so why bother having it at all if it doesn't actually add to the game?"
civbeyondearth,3alr0w,94067,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:50:00 2015 UTC,"Those kind of negative choices work pretty well in EU IV, so it's not like it can't be implemented in a good way."

civbeyondearth,3alr0w,94067,7,Mon Jun 22 19:41:25 2015 UTC,"Add weapons with more rapid destruction potential, because the future would certainly have those.   If I could be the obligatory Alpha Centauri fanboy...  One thing AC did was have a separate combat type to your traditional ""shoot the bad men"" warfare, and that was PSI Combat. PSI attacks ignored defences, fortifications and even traditional strength scores. Instead it attacked a unit's psyche directly, dealing more damage to infantry but being deadly to almost everything, and if PSI combat occured in a base the base immediately lost 1 pop as citizens inside are driven mad and suicidal.   Humans couldn't use PSI at first, obviously, but it was actually all the more horrifying because it was the basic attack for the native lifeforms! If a Mind Worm boil approached your base you'd freak out, even if you had highly advanced units defending it, because Mind Worms don't give a fuck. This also helped give the native lifeforms a lot of personality as these utterly alien terror beasts, which I think BE lacks - in BE aliens are just kind of... there, and nobody really seems to be particularly amazed by this.  Humans in AC could eventually engage in PSI warfare of their own, and technological development let them become even better than the aliens, with improved PSI attack and defence. There was even an early Wonder that gave you fortification against them. What this did was give mid/lategame players a way to mess up cities quickly, and PSI sieges became effective, if very casualty heavy.  You could have fun with this in the Affinity systems. Maybe Supremacy become less vulnerability to it thanks to their augmentation shielding their mind. Maybe Purity get a Strength bonus from their strength of will, especially when using Mind Control - or maybe they just counter PSI with big guns. And maybe Harmony get the Gians old bonus, allowing them to mind control friendly aliens and getting a bonus to PSI for every nearby alien mind."
civbeyondearth,3alr0w,Skitterleaper,5,Sun Jun 21 17:12:39 2015 UTC,"I normally get pretty irritated when someone brings AC into the discussion (I'm convinced people view it through rose-tinted lenses), but I actually have to agree on the bit about PSI - it was a very clever way to have aliens remain relevant late-game while not being completely overwhelming in the early game.  I could actually see Purity being the most vulnerable to PSI, with a key exception being Battlesuits, who presumably are closer to Space Marines in function and training than normal soldiers.  Harmony, obviously, could just befriend the aliens, and Supremacy's AI units are immune while their other units go all wacky in some way when dealing with PSI units."
civbeyondearth,3alr0w,Drake55645,2,Mon Jun 22 02:49:52 2015 UTC,I have no tinted glasses since I only started playing AC about a month ago. I had avoided it for a long time because the graphics looked bad and all the options seemed overwhelming. It has since become one of my favorite games. There is so much cleverness and depth to it; it's sadly refreshing given most modern games.
civbeyondearth,3alr0w,ksa6,4,Mon Jun 29 00:18:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really say nukes are a remedy for runaways. Runaways are the first civs, generally, to get to the techs for WMDs.  I'm not sure negative quests would affect runaways, unless civs with a high score were more likely to get them.  Some mechanics for handling the situation (civs 1 to 3 had corruption) are a bit unfun. 5 generally goes with:  (a) virtue/policy penalty for number of cities  (b) fixed number of trade routes per civ  (c) science penalty for number of cities  (d) AI attitude becomes wary  (e) happiness penalty for occupied cities, culture/science/build choice penalty for puppets  (f) sources of happiness are fixed (and in CBE, happiness is more easily handled in tall civs)  (g) science cost discount if civs you know have researched the tech (this obviously has less of an impact in CBE)  Since this issue affects a lot of 4x games, you might want to ask /r/4xgaming what they'd do about it."
civbeyondearth,3alr0w,I_pity_the_fool,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:04:30 2015 UTC,"I vastly prefer fixed trade routes per civ to other systems, since it both serves as an equalizer and makes tall play more viable."
civbeyondearth,3alr0w,Galgus,3,Sun Jun 21 23:03:01 2015 UTC,"For the first issue, stopping runaways, I'd propose a formal alliance system called Federations.  This would essentially allow AIs to gang up on a runaway player, potentially with some perks that grow in strength when behind.    I'd much rather have a real world war than nukes, since they largely dumb the game down into buildings and launching them.  Thematically I view the lack of nukes as a lesson learned from the Great Mistake - even the most aggressive warmonger wouldn't risk a repeat of it.  It would also help to lower how much combat strength changes with higher Affinity units, and make it mainly about their abilities.  That would certainly cut down on the invincible runaway problem.    Negative quests just don't sound fun or interesting.  I'd rather see stronger quest bonuses, with the downsides of each option being mainly the opportunity costs associated with them.  At most, I'd have some grant a positive bonus vs a stronger positive bonus with a downside, like +3 Production and -2 Health from Manufactories.    I like random events, but I'd give players options on how to respond to them that could give interesting boosts.  Some could be purely negative, but generally players could spin them into an advantage.  The Events and Decisions mod for Civ 5 did this well, but I'd like to see more variety."

It seems odd that the Biofuel Plant's quest seems to equate energy and food when food seems far stronger, but I can see the mod is trying to make energy more relevant.

civbeyondearth,3aelsf,Velrei,31,Sat Jun 20 00:25:29 2015 UTC,I bet that the third expansion is going to include orbital cities
civbeyondearth,3aelsf,marcelog12,16,Fri Jun 19 16:55:38 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for a whole revamp of the orbital layer, including orbital cities.  I'm also hoping they reduce costs for satellites to make them more essential, instead of being stuck with a number limited by the amount of petroleum you have.  Also, I'm hoping they include ways to remotely launch satellites.  That way I don't have to leap frog cities to launch Phasal satellites on the other side of the map.  Either a unit that remotely delivers satellites or a naval unit that remotely launches satellites would be awesome."
civbeyondearth,3aelsf,the_other_brand,10,Fri Jun 19 20:55:37 2015 UTC,Oh shit that sounds awesome
civbeyondearth,3aelsf,lessthanadam,3,Fri Jun 19 17:13:38 2015 UTC,"If they aren't including it in this expansion, I'd love to see a whole alien civilization focus to be the next expansion."
civbeyondearth,3aelsf,BodaciousGhost,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:58:36 2015 UTC,How? They'd have to revamp everything. The affinities wouldn't even make sense anymore. It also defeats the purpose of a civilization game. You're guiding the future of humanity.
civbeyondearth,3aelsf,MrDeadfisch,3,Fri Jun 19 22:30:31 2015 UTC,"They did it in SMAC-AX, and it was awesome.   The aliens you played as were sentient offworlders who turned up to research and exploit the planet and ended up stranded after a crash landing. Their victory was basically The Signal - building a huge transmitter to call for backup."
civbeyondearth,3aelsf,Skitterleaper,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:19:53 2015 UTC,"That still wouldn't work at all. This is the equivalent of the people asking for total war style battles in paradox games. The techs would need to be reworked. Culture, troop models. EVERYTHING has been done from the point of humans. You can't just throw on a passive bonus and call it a day."
civbeyondearth,3aelsf,MrDeadfisch,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:39:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't expect them to just ""slap on a bonus."" Considering that Firaxis is going to charge 30 euros for any new expansion, I'd expect big changes. Having unique models is fine, heck, the aliens from SMAC did too. Culture can still work mechanically the same... heck, with the policies you could almost just rename them if you were lazy, or give the aliens their own unique culture trees. The tech web doesn’t have to diverge too much, but perhaps add some new alien technologies that maybe the aliens start with, and that humans need to salvage alien tech to begin researching - either through trade or conquest. Or, hell, maybe you have it rather than landers, the aliens are actually intelligent natives in their culture's late mideval period that end up with an accelerated scientific revolution thanks to finding humanity's junk. They might get more of a boost off of expeditions, and can build native wildlife units from the start. Or something.   Back in SMAC, Firaxis made it so aliens couldn't even talk to humans without researching Xeno Linguistics, so maybe we can bring that back. They couldn't trade conventionally with humans, either, so perhaps we can work that into trade routes -alien civilisations provide Science and Culture rather than Energy. You also weren't able to capture alien bases - you just exterminated the population - which makes even warfare with them about different goals. The above all also applied/applies vice-versa for aliens interacting with humans.  Finally, it'd be cool if the aliens were actually, well, alien. I never got why the presence of native wildlife wasn't more of a big deal in BE. Make an alien faction use terrain differently; maybe they get bonuses from miasma tiles, but use Energy rather than Food to expand, so they favour entirely different tiles to most human settlements - at first. Then you might have a faction with a little personality rather than the slightly bland ones we have."
civbeyondearth,3aelsf,Skitterleaper,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:52:21 2015 UTC,"Unique models aren't fine. Here's why. Every faction of humans has all three affinities plus basic units. If the aliens did not have that they would be cutting content. You have the soldier, ranger, combat rover, missile rover, needle jet, cruiser, carrier, and now patrol boat, and submarine. Each of these classes has two base models then two more for each of the three affinities (minus the carrier which only has two levels). That would be 52 brand new models just for military alone not even getting to balancing brand new culture and tech web, or hell even cities, explorers, workers, or improvements.  Every new piece added to an alien faction would also not affect the actual human civilizations resulting in less content for the core of the game. Dividing content just makes no bloody sense when you can add new factions and units, policies, etc. That everyone could get.  Finally, this game is still about humanity. The intro cinematic clearly shows a story of humanity surviving and moving forward. The entire affinity system is about guiding and adapting humanity into the future. Adding aliens is just a fundamentally bad idea to this game.  As for the getting bonuses to miasma tiles. Harmony does that. Play Harmony. As of Rising Tide there will also be a fix to developing faction traits giving them personality that you develop."
civbeyondearth,3aelsf,MrDeadfisch,0,Sat Jun 20 19:14:58 2015 UTC,That still doesn't really make a lot of sense in this new game. Their is nothing they can't accomplish with a sponsor from Earth that you're proposing
civbeyondearth,3aelsf,maytagem,0,Sat Jun 20 02:59:17 2015 UTC,"I've made a few suggestions in a post below. It's just... new sponsors from Earth don't really excite me, just because they're all so bland and forgettable. Even with sponsor bonuses they all play pretty similarly. And with the native wildlife being much more passive and mundane than their predecessors in Alpha Centauri, it's just... Beyond Earth could be taking place on a ruined earth for all the difference the setting makes."

There's already so many space games that follow the same formula, why make yet another game that put human factions to fight alien factions?  Anyway, I'm just telling the facts: It's very unlikely that they will add an alien faction, it's just not what BE is about."

You can use your Explorers to straight up take control of Alien units in the wild. [...] They belong to you. So if you liked [Harmony], you're going to love them a lot more now.

While I welcome Harmony being able to use Aliens, I'm really hoping this is limited to colonies with Harmony as their affinity.  One of the big letdowns of BE was that the Aliens were never even close to adequately bloodthirsty, so I'd rather not see everyone tame them.  At this point little could better convince me of solid design work in Rising Tide than a stream of some dev getting legitimately overrun by Aliens."
civbeyondearth,3a6kwo,Galgus,4,Thu Jun 18 03:29:52 2015 UTC,"Aishia Kishk had 3H/7P/0S.... so it might not require a lot of Harmony to get the ability. However, Dave did say something about levels.

I wonder how this affect borders though, and if you are limited to your own territory or you can go wherever you want.  edit: So, the cities will use production to move and looks like moving the city grows your border. They are also very slow, but can be used offensively. It sounds like moving the city isn't merely an option, it's fundamental to the water gameplay."

civbeyondearth,3a6kwo,leandrombraz,7,Thu Jun 18 14:57:46 2015 UTC,"The way I feel about it, the game at launch is never better than the previous one with all of its expansions. A few years ago everyone was disappointed at Civ5 because it was inferior to 4, and it truly was. It was only after Gods and Kings that it became its equal and after BNW that it vastly surpassed it. It will likely be the same with Beyond Earth. I definitely think that the things we're seeing are steps in the right direction.   I wish they did more with the orbital layer though, like space stations and resources in space that can be improved. Maybe in the expansion after this."
civbeyondearth,3a6kwo,c0mad0r,2,Thu Jun 18 17:28:08 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the game would never be THIS, even if they had worked on BE for another year and tried to add more stuff. What we would get is the base game with more content, but that would still follow the same original view, with the same fundamental flaws. That's the biggest advantage of expansions/DLC, they can build more content based on our feedback and things they learn once the game is out.   I see people using this flawed logic a lot with Civ V, this ""should have been like that at launch"" argument. If they had worked more on Civ V, maybe we would get a better base game, but it wouldn't be G&K, it wouldn't be BNW and surely it would carry much of the flaws that this two expansions fixed."

civbeyondearth,3a51mf,igncom1,33,Wed Jun 17 07:45:57 2015 UTC,"It's a fun game, especially with the tech web and the affinities. I think the only problem is it's not as fleshed out as BNW, but it's better than Civ V at launch."
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,jaredjeya,17,Wed Jun 17 09:35:18 2015 UTC,"I think the only problem is it's not as fleshed out as BNW, but it's better than Civ V at launch.   Yeah, this. I dropped Civ5 after 30-40 hours of play until the expansions hit (now it has several hundred hours of play). Civ:BE... after having played Civ:BE for ~50 hours, I'm starting to get quite bored by it.  People just expect it to be a 100+ hour game like Civ5+BNW and it's definitely not that. The other comparison to it, SMAC, didn't help either.  Basically, it's suffering from Firaxis' track record with games, people don't accept ""decent"" from Firaxis, they want ""excellent"" every time (same reason why Civ5 had a rather negative reception at the beginning)."
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,WhatGravitas,5,Wed Jun 17 09:59:47 2015 UTC,"Heh, I liked Civ V at launch too!  I'm generally not that picky overall."
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,Manannin,2,Thu Jun 18 04:54:25 2015 UTC,"They've got it to the point where I'm enjoying it, the auto-renew trade routes function helped immensely."
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,the_s_d,4,Thu Jun 18 18:19:16 2015 UTC,"Also, keep in mind that it appears OP got in recently, therefore, certainly after the fall balance patch and all the sundry fixes since then. It's a pretty significant difference from the launch experience!"
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,MasterOfParadox,2,Thu Jun 18 20:20:26 2015 UTC,"Once Rising Tides and other expansions come out, it'll be absolutely amazing, though."
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,Merhouse,8,Fri Jun 19 06:53:33 2015 UTC,"Everyone has different opinions. As a previous non-Civ player, I bought V at the suggestion of a friend. I enjoyed it very much, even though I really wasn't very good at it.  Based on that experience, I bought BE at launch, and for reasons I can't even explain, I just didn't care for it. I am sure that Fraxis is thrilled some people are enjoying their efforts.  I have been a dedicated Sim City fan since the original (Classic) through SC 4 Rush Hour. I couldn't get them quickly enough. I was very excited about the 2013 edition until I read about the way it was going to work. It didn't sound like something I would like, so I didn't buy it.  Now,, Cities:Skylines, well, THAT is a game.  But that's just me -- one person. YMMV :)"
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,Fairgrim,3,Wed Jun 17 12:34:23 2015 UTC,"Skylines is what everyone wanted from SC 2013 especially since it has full Steam Workshop support,"
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,Merhouse,2,Fri Jun 19 00:20:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Every time I start playing, next thing I know it's like 3 hours later, and I only wish I could continue for another 3 and then another 3 ;)"
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,cannons_for_days,11,Fri Jun 19 02:46:52 2015 UTC,"I think it all pretty much boils down to:  did you play Civ V?  Did you play just the base game, or all the expansions?  If yes to both, you aren't impressed with Civ:BE.  If yes to the first but not the second, you like it, but it's not fantastic.  If no to both, but you like 4X games, Civ:BE is a great game and you will easily lose 40 hours of your life to one more turn syndrome."
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,bouncehouseplaya,2,Wed Jun 17 14:20:30 2015 UTC,But I played civ 5 after the expansions and I have almost double the hours played in BE. The setting is way more fun imo.
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,Galgus,5,Thu Jun 18 04:24:57 2015 UTC,"The game is a bit too bland to offer much replay-ability to me at the moment, and it has always been in the shadow of the amazing game I think it could be.  I hope that Rising Tide will help with this.  Beyond Earth has amazing, but largely untapped potential in my opinion."
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,the_s_d,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:26:36 2015 UTC,"Dude, you are so right.  Specifically, the new diplomacy changes have me very excited.  If they do it right, they'll have a real opportunity to bridge the gap between Civ and SMAC, which is an obvious strategy toward a future SMAC reboot.  Please, Firaxis gods, do these things!"
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,Galgus,5,Thu Jun 18 20:15:41 2015 UTC,"The diplomacy rework is a huge step forward, but there are two things I want more than anything else:   For Affinities to have a deeper peacetime impact on how the game plays. Aliens that will actually swarm, and kill, cities. Death to the Ultrasonic Fence!     Biome gameplay changes will also be nice, but I hope they don't make them too minor, or at least that it will lead to some interesting mods."
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,the_s_d,3,Thu Jun 18 20:22:20 2015 UTC,"For the first, that would add a great deal to the sort of emergent story we enjoy when invested in a game.  I like that.   Aliens that will actually swarm, and kill, cities.   Yeah, the E3 interviews keep claiming that they are oh-so-much-more than barbarians (now).  I hope so!  Perhaps something like an improved siege worm which can tunnel underneath the fence (which we assume to only penetrate so far below ground) and just pop up to troll you if you don't keep some defensive units within city bombardment range to help out.  Maybe the acoustic properties of water make that the fence much better for oceanic city protection, but certain strategic resources come only from land.  So, you must either trade or settle where the dangerous aliens are!  Combining the two ideas, we could see things that incentivise the Harmony path, which is just so hard for me to convince myself to bother with.  Perhaps at higher affinity levels of Harmony, you have some of these troll worms at your command, or perhaps they seek out sponsors that you're at war with automatically (like city state units)!"
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,Galgus,3,Thu Jun 18 21:10:47 2015 UTC,"The best way to show that affinities are different, in my opinion, is to tie the themes into mechanics.    In my opinion an Ultrasonic Fence is totally incompatible with dangerous Aliens in the game.  Players should just need to maintain armies to keep hostile Aliens at bay.  Ideally Harmony should have a scaled-to-modern-tech Alien army late game to wipe out other factions, if the Aliens haven't been devastated already."
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,Robolenin,3,Thu Jun 18 21:58:05 2015 UTC,"Beyond Earth, by Firaxis' own admission, was lacking in some areas. I really had a blast with the game until I'd unlocked all the achievements, which was some 170 hours.  It's after you've explored all of the game's content that you start feeling its relative lack of depth compared to C5 BNW.   The problem is that many mainstream reviewers just didn't have enough time to explore this nuance, so there was a disparity between review sites '11/10 would space again', and the community. BE just isn't enough of a dissimilar product from Civ 5 to avoid comparison, and the comparison at this stage in the 3 title release cycle is a pretty harsh one."
civbeyondearth,3a51mf,_pupil_,3,Thu Jun 18 06:06:43 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.  I used to fantasize while playing Civ V about a sci-fi version of the game, but BE petered out for me.  It's objectively hard to dismiss the game as a failure with 150+ hours played, that would normally be considered a smashing success... I think it's partly the uncanny valley: BE is newer and cooler than Civ V, but not nearly as filled out and satisfying as Civ V.  I think the designers have really identified the core of the issue: without the historical context the fictive and engaging nature of Civ yields to some shallow game mechanics.  It'd be different if the game were set in a pre-existing universe, or engaged in story-building like Alpha Centauri, but without that backdrop you're not  engaging your internal storytelling.  It's less iconic.  My big hope for BE, though it would likely require a sequel, would be to have affinity levels governed by progress through the tech web while your affinity was shaped only by gameplay choices and applications of technology.  Balancing the consequences of dirty plasma reactors or resource demanding fusion, bio-hypnosis vs nerve-stapling, alien farms vs nature preserves, etc.  I think your development needs to be driven by action, not icon selection, to create that missing fictive story."

That said, people who were disappointed with it are every bit as much entitled to their opinion as you are to yours.   I found it lackluster and boring while not really setting itself apart from Civ 5 enough and actually removing many of the features that made Civ 5 fun.   If you enjoyed it, that's great. But you shouldn't feel ""led on"" because other people have opinions."

There were also expanded options based on different factors. One really cool thing they showed was a new explorer option to 'leash' an alien unit and put it under your control. There were also a few other new alien units, one of which is like the fungal towers from SMAC but on the water."

I've said it before, in a vacuum, this game is great, with solid room to grow. It just has a big golden brother standing next to it while we praise the golden boy of civ 5 for being older and better, Beyond Earth is still catching up.   The expansion seems to be hinting at a different direction of Civ, something even 5 cant do with its oceans, so I am quite excited."

civbeyondearth,39unh2,bouncehouseplaya,10,Mon Jun 15 09:27:17 2015 UTC,"Yup, this just about sums it up perfectly. The way people have beat on it mainly using 5 as a comparison has almost seemed unfair to me, because Civ 5 is a really tough act to follow and there's a different content direction with BE that hasn't even been fully realised yet.  It's a solid title, and I don't regret paying what I did for it. Buy it, buy it now."
civbeyondearth,39unh2,frotographer,3,Mon Jun 15 15:00:14 2015 UTC,You're right. People are comparing Civ:BE to Civ 5 complete the same way people compared Civ 5 Vanilla to Civ IV complete.  I don't regret buying either one.
civbeyondearth,39unh2,SolipsisticSoup,3,Wed Jun 17 02:12:05 2015 UTC,"Plus, they've fixed the trade route thing, and plan to fix diplomacy next expansion in a few months. Those two things together make it a lot stronger."

With that said, if you love Civ games, it should definitely give you at least $12 worth of entertainment even if you don't like it as much as Civ V.  People are quick to judge it and put it down because it isn't as good as Civ V but it entertained me for enough time to justify buying it.  I'm not really sure how they will handle pricing regarding Rising Tides though.  I'm hopeful that expansion will improve BE significantly."
civbeyondearth,39unh2,KingofZeal,5,Sun Jun 14 23:57:40 2015 UTC,The biggest thing for those who have played BE in the expansion is the revamped diplomacy.  Should be a better fit for the game.  We'll see what the E3 demo shows.

Nowhere near the time spent in Civ V, but worth it for me.  What I particularly like about Beyond Earth:   Advanced startup options (colonist choice, starting worker, etc.) Can play a wide empire strategy Sci-fi atmosphere Weather Controller and Orbital Fabricator satellites Early techs actually do something; in Civ V, you often research several worker technologies before even getting your first worker, or low-priority buildings."

civbeyondearth,39unh2,AlchemicRez,4,Sun Jun 14 23:06:29 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what $12 means to you and what else it can buy you.

On the other hand, if $12 is easy to come by for you, and can buy you relatively little (ie. $12 would buy two beers where I live) then for sure, I say, take a chance on this game."

civbeyondearth,39unh2,HerbHertz,13,Mon Jun 15 20:25:18 2015 UTC,"Since the latest patch? Yeah, it's worth $12. Even if it is basically a reskinned Civ V"
civbeyondearth,39unh2,congraved,8,Sun Jun 14 22:59:18 2015 UTC,I'll never get the 'reskinned civ v' comments. The way I play BE has little to do with how I play V...
civbeyondearth,39unh2,HiiiPowerd,3,Mon Jun 15 11:55:49 2015 UTC,EXACTLY.
civbeyondearth,39unh2,energyinmotion,6,Tue Jun 16 06:57:17 2015 UTC,"It doesn't even use the same style of tech tree. People who say it's a reskinned version of civ V have no idea what ""reskinned"" means."
civbeyondearth,39unh2,etibbs,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:42:44 2015 UTC,Has the newest patch made it more lile CiV? Because it wasn't like it at launch.
civbeyondearth,39unh2,AudioSly,3,Mon Jun 15 03:32:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It's decent enough now on it's own if you get over the fact that Civ V exists, and will certainly get better with 2.0,  RT and future patches."
civbeyondearth,39unh2,El_Barto_227,3,Mon Jun 15 02:36:12 2015 UTC,The value of $12 is relative.    I have played all the civs since the original. I have put hundreds of hours into Brave New World.    I just couldn't get into Beyond Earth and would have real trouble recommending it to anyone.
civbeyondearth,39unh2,Man-alive,3,Mon Jun 15 09:21:02 2015 UTC,Bought it yesterday on sale.  No regrets so far.
civbeyondearth,39unh2,pdboddy,3,Mon Jun 15 15:50:49 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that, even if you don't get the expansion, it should get much better with the 2.0 patch that has been promised.  In particular diplomacy is getting an overhaul."
civbeyondearth,39unh2,Galgus,3,Tue Jun 16 02:56:31 2015 UTC,Yes its worth it. Just buy it already. This is as cheap as its going to get until the next major Steam sale.
civbeyondearth,39unh2,energyinmotion,8,Tue Jun 16 06:59:38 2015 UTC,"I am a HUGE fan of civ v and bought BE in release. I have played all the patches and csn confidently say that I have no interest in playing BE. As others have said, it's a reskinned civ v and I would much rather play v than BE. I'm probably in the minority but if you still actively play v then don't buy it."
civbeyondearth,39unh2,Cripple13,2,Mon Jun 15 00:17:16 2015 UTC,"Have to say that this was exactly my experience.  I had tried one of  the early Civ titles (don't remember which one) and really didn't care for it. A friend strongly suggested that I try Civ V, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it.  I then went out and bought BE at release,  played it a couple of times,  and haven't gone back. Maybe for $12 if you're really into it, but I wish I hadn't bought it."
civbeyondearth,39unh2,Merhouse,2,Mon Jun 15 04:55:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah its worth $12, but the better question to ask is how much you enjoyed civ 5. Do you have over 1000 hours in civ 5? Well then buy it immedeatly."
civbeyondearth,39unh2,captain_duck,2,Mon Jun 15 10:27:10 2015 UTC,Wait for the expansions. The game is fun the first few games but after that every game is exactly the same.
civbeyondearth,39unh2,cbfw86,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:09:44 2015 UTC,Honestly i own it but it feels bland and shallow. I'd wait for major expansions to hit and just play CIV V/IV instead.  It's basicly CIV V with it's soul gutted out and replaced by spacey stuff.
civbeyondearth,39unh2,Gutterblade,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:36:04 2015 UTC,"Yes definitly worth $12! I paid something like $60 AUD (like 48 USD) and I have enjoyed it, probably haven't earnt my money's worth yet. But if I could pick it up for that I would have been amazingly happy."
civbeyondearth,39unh2,sweaty_wombat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:20:42 2015 UTC,"I have paid full price at release, and spent something like 40 hours in it. I'd say it's well worth 12$ now especially including all of the fixes.  I'm playing more Civ V now and I hardly play BE, but I still consider BE a good game."
civbeyondearth,39unh2,RitualST,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:36:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth $12. I would say it isn't worth $60. $30 would be fair and anything under that is solid.   For $60 I would have expected a better interface (coloring the techs or things unlocked by them: red for military, blue for science, etc; as well as many others interface tweaks/polishes), better use of the affinity system (right now you get points for techs and those points get you static passive bonuses and unit upgrades), and better progression from the early to mid and late games (the victories imo need to be looked at, they all feel really bland and boring).  As it was it was good, but lacking. At launch, I would have called it a finished game but at $40."
civbeyondearth,39unh2,atticu5,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:16:30 2015 UTC,"Do you guys think I should buy it, I meet the minimum Req for the game but on the recommended specs my CPU and RAM fall behind. https://imgur.com/a/swC7L"
civbeyondearth,39unh2,millnar,3,Mon Jun 15 17:51:58 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking the smaller the game is the easier it is to run. Duel and tiny aren't taxing at all, small and standard a bit more, and large and huge the most. Even then It really only slows down towards the end of the games when there are more units, cities, wars, etc. Civ V and BE both have demos on steam, why don't you try out the demo and see if it's something you like"
civbeyondearth,39unh2,flyingtiger188,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:53:07 2015 UTC,"On sale, where for that price?"
civbeyondearth,39unh2,Moobyghost,0,Mon Jun 15 22:22:15 2015 UTC,Why ask here? The only people still in this community are the ones who liked it. You'll get a more honest answer in a general gaming community.
civbeyondearth,39unh2,stanley_twobrick,0,Mon Jun 15 13:19:06 2015 UTC,"I bought it at launch, and if it had been 12 dlls at launch I would have forgiven it. I say wait for the expansion and see if the game gets better."
civbeyondearth,39unh2,Kurgon999,-2,Mon Jun 15 17:16:52 2015 UTC,Yes... Basically it's Alpha Centauri with all of the personality removed.
civbeyondearth,39v4qp,Ferretsroq,7,Mon Jun 15 01:31:20 2015 UTC,Nope.  Edit: Not aware of a mod that does it either.
civbeyondearth,39v4qp,Blandfish,3,Mon Jun 15 03:24:06 2015 UTC,That's unfortunate. Guess I'm still not getting it then. Thanks =\
civbeyondearth,39v4qp,Manannin,3,Mon Jun 15 12:07:38 2015 UTC,"It looks like they had to sacrifice it for the orbital layer, I watched a lot of the videos about the game before it was released, and I swear someone said that they had to lose it for orbital later. I sympathise, as it runs terrible on my pc too... luckily I've got a new one on its way."
civbeyondearth,39v4qp,boxtears,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:52:41 2015 UTC,I barely even use the orbital layer.  I honestly wouldn't notice it was gone if they just removed it and reinstated strat view.
civbeyondearth,39v4qp,crasher_pt,6,Thu Jun 18 04:05:50 2015 UTC,No. I suspect it has something to do with the orbital layer. Not saying they're the same thing but it's kind of suspicious when one takes the place of the other.
civbeyondearth,39v4qp,Tserraknight,4,Mon Jun 15 10:38:17 2015 UTC,"Question, if I may? Why is strategic view a dealbreaker for you?"
civbeyondearth,39s2km,kawiah,24,Sun Jun 14 05:14:00 2015 UTC,The game isn't best when you play it like it is other civ games. The tech tree takes some time to learn the best progression for upgrades and units. More often than not the npcs react to your chosen affinity to initiate being allies. It is likely they are fighting each other. Give it a go on another map.
civbeyondearth,39s2km,bouncehouseplaya,4,Sun Jun 14 05:49:59 2015 UTC,"I think that just happens because of the maps sometimes. If you can tell the game won't go somewhere interesting after awhile, regenerate it.  I actually like it less that the sea dragons stop being a threat at the end of the game and end up taking up space in weird places. Limitations on early naval travel is fine, spamming gunboats might be OP otherwise."
civbeyondearth,39s2km,lordhadri,28,Sun Jun 14 05:27:02 2015 UTC,"Well... you were warned?  Seriously,  most people I talked to were disappointed overall and after going back to it after several months of just not touching the game, I honestly can't blame them.  You'd think having to form a ""live and let live"" relationship with the aliens would be interesting but it's not.  Barbarians constantly prodding at your borders and raiding your improvements - that was actually more fun.    Same with stations.  City-states being watered down into these boring stations - I can't even imagine what the developers were thinking when they made them these lifeless outposts that add absolutely nothing to the gameplay except another possible route for your trade convoys.  No alliances to form, no units to gift or be gifted... and of course no congress votes to add to your pool because there is no global congress.  And of course the terrain - zero landmarks or natural wonders.  If you've seen one area of terrain, you've pretty much seen it all.  Combine that with lack of luxury/health resources that you can trade with other factions and you have one of the blandest 4x titles ever made.  Firaxis needs to do some serious overhauling from the ground up before it can even be playable.  Hell, they should bring back tech trees so we can have eras and experience some real sense of progress again.  All I can say is you were warned."
civbeyondearth,39s2km,boxtears,8,Sun Jun 14 06:02:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I read mixed reviews.  The other nations just seem to have no personality at all.  I loved the city-states. The outposts don't DO anything. You don't even have to work for their favor. Just send a convoy their way and get some meager returns handed over.  The lack of luxuries was something I wasn't expecting. Even the resources that are available seem a lot less useful than in past games. The only material I had my hands on by turn 165 was Firaxis and I didn't make any units or anything with it.  Nor was the terrain. Is it just me, or is this in the trap of having that stereotypical ""space-age"" color palette on everything? Good grief."
civbeyondearth,39s2km,boxtears,21,Sun Jun 14 06:45:17 2015 UTC,"It seems like the lead designers were constantly saying ""no"" when they really should've said ""yes.""  They should've just went wild with their ideas.  A more fleshed-out diplomacy system with comically over-the-top and larger-than-life personalities for the leaders?  Should've said yes.  Alien factions with unique tech and storyline?  Should've said yes.  Unique landmarks that offer benefits so huge or are so integral to the narrative that factions can't afford not to fight over them?  Should've said yes.   Unique art for every single quest decision, along with quests that actually had interesting choices?  Should've said yes.  Wonders that were as powerful as in SMAC or Civ 5 (free perimeter defense in every base, a copy of every military unit you own)?  Should've said yes.   A way to check and customize how your leader is evolving according to affinity levels?  Should've said yes.  Workers and tile improvements that change their appearance according to affinity?  Should've said yes.    None of this was beyond their budget or capability. There should've been goodies littered throughout the map that made the game feel like a discovery... like you didn't know what to expect with each pod opened or ruin explored.  Instead, most of them were the same +affinity or +energy/virtue/science points."
civbeyondearth,39s2km,Sheafer,9,Sun Jun 14 12:37:27 2015 UTC,"A civ5 skin would be such a vastly superior game. What annoys me is that it's not even really replacements that don't work - it's just less. With the exception of the tech tree/Web change, there's nothing here that's not on civ5 - and an awful lot on civ5 that isn't here. I share your disappointment.  (and yes it's also bloody ugly)"
civbeyondearth,39s2km,markgraydk,2,Sun Jun 14 07:56:58 2015 UTC,"I really don't get why they didn't port more of the systems and game mechanics from civ5. Maybe there's a technical explanation but it seems as a waste of resources to invent the wheel again (or just leave features out of the game). I'm looking forward to the expansion but what I've heard so far does not give me much great hope that much will change. Yes, a new improved diplomacy is great but cities in the ocean seem to be a weird choice of using there resources when so much of the base game is lacking.  E.g. I like the affinity system for giving me civ a new look and tying in resources to it but the leveling up seems arbitrary. They could have used either the base from religion (or even ideologies) to make it much more interesting. Why can't I convert other civs to my affinity and why is it not a victory condition? Why don't we have culture or diplomacy victory conditions either? Don't they have that in the future? They could put a spin on the civ 5 game mechanics but still keep the core of them in the game. Lack of natural wonders and luxury resources as well as the poor health system and no city states are a given for improvement."
civbeyondearth,39s2km,gorbachev,-2,Wed Jun 17 13:44:00 2015 UTC,"Trust me, it doesn't get better with play either. You eventually realize that everything is so heavily balanced that your direction in the tech tree, and basically everything else, is basically irrelevant to how you'll play the game."
civbeyondearth,39s2km,mbrochh,3,Sun Jun 14 20:36:59 2015 UTC,"You are playing it wrong. By turn 80 you can have three outposts and usually that gets you into the territory of another civ and they will start nagging at you.  Once you chose an affinity, Civs of a different affinity will start to hate you and start a war more easily.  The game o ly has a few unit types but they get upgrades (and their looks change) as you gain affinity.  You don't need to fight the aliens. Just ignore them."
civbeyondearth,39s2km,Aeleas,2,Sun Jun 14 23:32:51 2015 UTC,You don't need to fight the aliens. Just ignore them.   But...the only good bug is a dead bug.
civbeyondearth,39s2km,sweaty_wombat,3,Tue Jun 16 13:39:18 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest things I have noticed is that it feels like you aren't actually competing with eachother for anything. This is due to the non-linear tech web. So you are rushing a certain tech to unlock a unit or wonder to beat the enemy to it. I don't know whether this is a good thing or bad thing, it is just different.   Also the wonders are a piece of shite and sea dragons are op.   I just had a multiplayer game where both my opponents just bailed out at the same time around 180 turns in. I reckon I could have had victory within 40 turns but they were bored so they jumped ship. I was locked in war for almost the entire game with one player, but no cities exchanged hands. I also lucked out and was able to expand to over 10 cities while they had 4 or so.   All in all not much happened."
civbeyondearth,39s2km,larknok1,2,Mon Jun 15 08:17:45 2015 UTC,Depends on game mode.  For the most contention and fun:  Protean world (pangaea) and large only. Massive puts you too far away from enemies for any real fun.
civbeyondearth,39s2km,Metecury,2,Tue Jun 16 00:05:26 2015 UTC,What is the speed? Difficulty? What is the level of alien hostility? Map type?
civbeyondearth,39s2km,Metecury,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:37:47 2015 UTC,Standard. Normal (I forgot what they're calling it... mercury?). Whatever the default is. I picked a random map. Looks like islands.
civbeyondearth,39s2km,jabontik,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:24:50 2015 UTC,I suggest you up the difficulty and select the equivalent of continents/pangea. If you want a challenge you should also increase alien hostility so while you wait for the other sponsors to land you have to fight the wildlife.
civbeyondearth,39s2km,Robolenin,2,Tue Jun 16 21:29:23 2015 UTC,"Try the second to hardest difficulty, with time set to quick. Gets really interesting, you basically only have 220 turns before one of the other civs (usually Africa or France) builds a mindflower and wins. I'm having a blast trying to figure out the best way to beat the game in those settings. And no, the stuff you research first (and the first virtues you choose) make a HUGE difference. Keeping health up while expanding, and getting affinity levels is very difficult. Once you get affinity 6 to 9, your boats will handle the sea dragons.  Yes, the skin takes getting used to, and the health and resources etc. It takes a while to learn what a good starting location is in this game. Not the same as other civs."
civbeyondearth,39s2km,D1STURBED36,3,Wed Jun 17 17:52:52 2015 UTC,This must be your first time here.
civbeyondearth,39s2km,Manannin,3,Sun Jun 14 15:23:05 2015 UTC,"Basically yea. Coming back to the game after a few months, started a new game.  on turn 155 literally nothing is happening. The only time civ's have contacted me (4 times in total) outside of the ""hello we just landed"" thing was:   Cooporation agreement (with no way to tell what it actually does on the screen) another cooporation agreement arc wanted me to go to war with them against slavic fed, accepted thinking they'd weaken eachother allowing me to get more ahead slavic fed wanted peace in exchange for a city. Accepted, annexed the city because it said i would get 0 unhappiness, but i got 7 (tooltip told me it was 0..). That war ended with no one attacking eachother.   Im on a seperate continent, just me and the Africans. They arnt competitive either, they have 2 cities to my 5. literally the entire game has been me building some units, new outposts, new buldings and picking research/culture shit.  Aliens dont even do anything. Theres numerous siege worms, none have attacked me and the alien land units have hit me like, once. Apart from that, the only conflict has been with 2-3 sea dragons destroying 2 or 3 of my gunboats.  I cant build even invade the Africans because theres so much miasma/mountains/impassable shit around me, it would take me 30-40 turns to get my units in that vicinity, and that isnt organising them in appropriate order/places.  The little shitty stations literally just feel like places for trade routes.  Theres been 6 alien units around my weak, fledgling annexed city and they dont do anything but sit around.  Miasma adds nothing to the game at all, other then being a nuisance and something for my workers to do when theres no nearby tiles to improve.  It honestly just feels like civ 5, except with a lot less content and new skins.  Honestly, it feels like the best part about the game was the introductory video. That was pretty badass and cool and got me hyped for what i thought would be an awesome game."

Basically doubles all of the specialist yields, which I find lets you go as wide as you want as even snow cities would thrive.

civbeyondearth,39m6ws,leandrombraz,6,Sat Jun 13 03:32:53 2015 UTC,This whole branch of the Civ franchise has really just struck me as a cash grab. They even admitted they never bothered beta testing and we saw the fruits of that in the months following launch.  I won't bother with this expansion unless I see some phenomenal reviews and significant amounts of added content.
civbeyondearth,39m6ws,DatAznGuy,3,Sat Jun 13 03:55:47 2015 UTC,"They didn't say that, they realized that they should have released a beta to the public, since the feedback after launch completely changed the way they see the game, so getting this feedback earlier would allow them to release something more in sync with the players expectations. They tested the game internally."
civbeyondearth,39m6ws,ilikecchiv,5,Sun Jun 14 17:45:38 2015 UTC,No kidding. I bought CIV:BE the day it came out. Was so pumped to see all the new features in the game. And was thoroughly disappointed when it came out.
civbeyondearth,39m6ws,STEALTHM0UNTAIN,6,Sat Jun 13 04:32:06 2015 UTC,"Same.  I've actually reinstalled and trying to enjoy it but small things like biomes so samey as civ 5, bland terraforming and no eco damage which pisses of aliens, the health system not being local to cities, having to mod cities so you have to actually protect them / make infantry useful.  The game is still too close to civ 5 or me, you would of thought that this little sneak peak would of brought some interesting hype."
civbeyondearth,39m6ws,3rd-wheel,5,Sat Jun 13 08:16:35 2015 UTC,Do you mean 'Sneak Peek'?
civbeyondearth,39m6ws,Manannin,6,Sat Jun 13 08:16:55 2015 UTC,"No, that's a completely different thing,  look:   http://s3.amazonaws.com/theoatmeal-img/comics/sneak_peek/sneak_peek.png"
civbeyondearth,39m6ws,boxtears,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:21:28 2015 UTC,"Oh man, at least this time we have to option to refund it though."
civbeyondearth,39m6ws,DefiantMars,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:04:58 2015 UTC,That told us exactly nothing about the game we didn't already know.
civbeyondearth,39m6ws,boxtears,5,Sat Jun 13 12:01:48 2015 UTC,"At the very least, they confirmed some of the information we've been speculating or assuming. Its nice to see that the improvement art for oceanic tiles were indeed just place holders.  I understand the frustration, but they have to build up hype for E3."
civbeyondearth,39m6ws,DefiantMars,0,Sat Jun 13 20:27:53 2015 UTC,"There's building hype... and then there's saying so little and barely updating any information that people gradually lose interest again.  If this is really addressing a lot of the problems people had with the game, they should be talking that up while still having plenty to showcase at E3.  Teasing with almost no information is just silly."
civbeyondearth,39m6ws,boxtears,3,Sun Jun 14 06:11:03 2015 UTC,"I'll admit that I myself wished to have seen more and there are definitely better examples of pre-expo publicity. Image management is indeed a huge deal. I'm hungering for more info, but I'm trying to be optimistic in a sea of scathing comments."
civbeyondearth,39m6ws,DefiantMars,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:10:37 2015 UTC,"I think we all want to be optimistic because we really want the devs to learn from community feedback and understand that players weren't disappointed with BE because we were too nostalgic over past installments in the Civ series... many were disappointed because BE felt like a considerable step backwards.  The lead designers have since begrudgingly admitted that they could've gone further... but I think when they finally admit (at least to themselves) that this just wasn't the game they should've put out, they can begin to make the necessary changes to really make BE a worthwhile experience."
civbeyondearth,39m6ws,leandrombraz,4,Sun Jun 14 12:21:29 2015 UTC,"Beyond Earth does need a lot to make it a worthwhile gaming experience. Its currently in an absurdly shallow state. There is so much more this game can be and I pray that we get there.  I'm aware that this is the internet, but I'm getting kind of fed up with the endless criticism. Not your comments, they're very founded and seem level headed. I'm drawing issue mainly with those that are beating a dead horse. The game did not live up to expectations. I get it, really I do. Granted, I have games that I simply despise as well. But that is the cumulative result of multiple titles, not just a single game.  It just seems to me that the mere mention of this game sets people off. Personally I think the game has decent enough bones to work off of, but its really starving for content. On a related note, I am completely and utterly confused about some of the ""missing content"" from Civ V (with Expansions). Specialists and Natural Wonders (I saw your comment in another post) come to mind. However, I do feel that this game will definitely need more than 2 Expansions to make it satisfying."
civbeyondearth,39m6ws,boxtears,3,Sun Jun 14 21:32:27 2015 UTC,"The livestream was to say what was their plans for E3, not to show the game. They actually showed more than was expected."
civbeyondearth,396hbk,skepticscorner,5,Tue Jun 9 16:32:31 2015 UTC,"In my opinion Dome stats are really bad in the base game.  So I made a simple mod to alter it to +2 Culture with no maintenance base, and +1 Food instead of +1 Energy with Biospheres.  Personally I think those Node yields are really too high unless you up the energy cost, but this is the XML used in that mod, Dome Upgrade.  <GameData>  <Improvements>     <Update>         <Where Type=""IMPROVEMENT_DOME""/>         <Set EnergyMaintenance=""0""/>     </Update> </Improvements> <Improvement_TechYieldChanges>      <Update>         <Where ImprovementType=""IMPROVEMENT_DOME"" TechType=""TECH_BIOSPHERES"" YieldType=""YIELD_ENERGY""/>         <Set Yield=""0""/>     </Update>      <Row>         <ImprovementType>IMPROVEMENT_DOME</ImprovementType>         <TechType>TECH_BIOSPHERES</TechType>         <YieldType>YIELD_FOOD</YieldType>         <Yield>1</Yield>     </Row>  </Improvement_TechYieldChanges>   </GameData>  I'm not a good modder by any means, but changing yields like that is usually pretty straightforward.  After you find a video on the bare basics of how to mod, its mostly a matter of figuring out how to do things.  I highly recommend visiting the civfanatics forum, which has a modding section where people smarter than me can answer your questions.  I also recommend scavenging for mods doing something similar to what you want to do, then downloading them to peek in their XML folder to figure out how to do whatever it is you want.  Which is why I posted that code here, so you don't have to mess around with its folders from the Steam Workshop to find it.  Learn to make simple mods yourself, and you can tweak some things to your liking - though I'm on a mod vacation until Rising Tide comes."

civbeyondearth,3951bt,oipoi,14,Tue Jun 9 08:38:57 2015 UTC,"Aliens really arent as scary as you might think. Just get some ultrasonic fences up, and then use rangers to kill em off from within the safety of your fences.   Also dont worry to much about negative health. Unlike in civ 5 you dont get combat penalties from unhealth. Even if your at -30 health your units will work just fine. This makes domination victories pretty easy.  The only thing you need to worry about is keeping your affinity levels high. If the AI gets a higher level then you they will stomp you. As an added bonus, once you get your affinity units aliens will be a joke."
civbeyondearth,3951bt,captain_duck,5,Tue Jun 9 12:16:59 2015 UTC,Even if his at -30 health
civbeyondearth,3951bt,lesser_futhark,2,Tue Jun 9 17:06:32 2015 UTC,Personally I prefer two or three Soldiers to kill off the Aliens.  In my opinion they are only anything resembling a threat if the player just doesn't have an army.
civbeyondearth,3951bt,Galgus,4,Tue Jun 9 14:47:29 2015 UTC,"For most of the game, aliens will not attack your units unless you A) attack them first, or B) are within two tiles of a nest.  This means you can often expand into alien ""territory"" without aggression and build an ultrasonic fence to keep the worms at bay.  If you build a city close enough and annex the tile the nest is in, eventually the aliens will become friendly to you and you can just colonize their territory wherever you like.  I have never managed to keep health in the green during the mid-game without going for health virtues, but depending on the type of game you're trying to win, you may not need positive health.  As others have mentioned, health does very little to limit your production and nothing at all to the combat effectiveness of your troops, so if you are trying to beat someone else into submission, negative health is not a problem.  It does seem that all your covert agents pretty much need to be set to steal tech/research in order not to fall behind in the affinity race, which means you need to manage your energy much more carefully, but who said conquering the world was easy, right?  I suppose you could just use Biowells everywhere instead of farms and reap the sweet, sweet health from it without bothering with the virtues.  If you're Purity, Biowells come with a little culture anyway, so you'd be getting a double hand towards the virtues that you wanted.  But biowells are expensive, and just laying them everywhere across your empire will cut sharply into your energy budget.  I don't know.  A small dip into the red isn't a big deal in this game - it's when you're down to, like, -30 health that it becomes nasty."
civbeyondearth,3951bt,cannons_for_days,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:04:02 2015 UTC,all you need to do is conquer three cities in quick order and you will be at -30 easily
civbeyondearth,3951bt,mbrochh,3,Fri Jun 12 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"Worms can be bad luck. But in general it is not a good idea to send your Colonists too far out, as you could do in Civ 5. I rarely have to clean out the aliens to expand, it's not a given they'll attack you (unless they're orange or red).   Do you have a standing army, or just some for defense in your cities when they declare war on you?  It's impossible to maintain green health without virtues, as cities generate more unhealth than they can generate health. So you'll need virtues, there's extra health for military unites, extra health for trade units, extra health for buildings, etc. Just pick the one you want."
civbeyondearth,3951bt,ArgonV,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:56:27 2015 UTC,Don't forget Biowells!
civbeyondearth,3951bt,DictatorDan,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:13:34 2015 UTC,"I rarely seem to need those, to be honest. I'm fine with letting my health get to - 15 or so during expansion, since I never experienced prolonged unhealth during the end game."
civbeyondearth,3951bt,ArgonV,3,Tue Jun 9 21:47:12 2015 UTC,"Do not kill aliens, not early game at least.  Just put up a fence and ignore them otherwise.  You might need to escort a settler if there's a lot of them though.  If you make a city next to a nest they'll become friendly after a while."
civbeyondearth,3951bt,nockle,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:13:36 2015 UTC,"I actually love the fact that I can easily lose the game on normal. Makes the mid and late game so much more thrilling. And makes me admire those super hard players all the more :  Here is another tip: On game setup chose the two things that give you culture. Build two explorers right away and aggressively find all those pods before your neighbors even have landed. Chose all the virtues in the right column which boost culture even more until you get to the bottom. Then the industry virtues, then growth virtues and finally military. Always use the fastest tree that gets you to the masive health bonuses. That will solve your health problems in the late-game especially if you plan to take over other cities.  Build the spy agency relatively early, you will swim in money. And don't forget to actually spend that money. A new outpost can be built up in just a few turns if you have 4k energy lying around.  And of course have a standing army next to each city. I like to have three units. One ranged unit and two melee units, whatever currently yields the most damage."
civbeyondearth,395lgq,Draehl,3,Tue Jun 9 12:32:25 2015 UTC,"affinity is really about the resources you have access to. All of them have some culture boosting things. The science/culture tree wil get you loads of culture.  Biowells and Academies both have nice upgrades to culture Specialists are weird and not all that useful since theres no more great people. Mostly just use the focus buttons in the top left. Try and focus your cities for best results. My capitol is usually on production focus, and get atleast one on science focus. The AI will decide if it wants to use the specialists or not."
civbeyondearth,395lgq,captain_duck,2,Tue Jun 9 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"Let's talk affinity first: /u/captain_duck was right that its largely about resources. Floatstone=Purity, Firaxite=Supremacy, Xenomass=Harmony.  You can use a combination if you parallel track, but its a longer game, and its harder to win. You can also use the mixed resources (2-3 of each here and there) to trade with other civs to buff your natural availability. But this gets harder as the affs get more different, b/c civs get salty about being different.  As for tile improvements: its been helpful for me to think about my terrain through the lenses of my culture, and affinity both. Some culture choices really buff some tiles, and so its natural to want more of those, while others debuff, and its good to counter act that (biowells + manufacturies/oil wells).  Also, depending on the available terrain, some tile improvements won't be as advantageous (terraforming is great for deserts, but not as great over grasslands, for instance).  Generators are usually my first builds along rivers (and throughout too) since they give +1 ept on river. Also, if you have rivers near your cap, and you find the free solar collector (late game build normally) you can really up your choices early game with the extra energy.  With no city states, and the stations taking up very little real estate, I've found that high pop cities gives way to more cities. The AI likes to build out, and since resources are so critical for affinities, you'll need the land. Population grows naturally throughout the game, so I wouldn't worry about it. Plus, the science buildings are (science per turn) rather than by pop for most, so its not as critical as Civ V.  Just my thoughts."
civbeyondearth,395lgq,avnti,2,Wed Jun 10 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"To answer your question about Specialists: In the city management screen there is a checkbox to show buildings at the bottom left.  Open that and you place people into those buildings. Only viable if you have a lot of excess food.  EDIT: It's bottom left, not bottom right, sorry."
civbeyondearth,393tgo,jonts26,5,Tue Jun 9 01:40:41 2015 UTC,Firaxis released a two part introduction to modding specifically for Civ:BE starting here  Part 2
civbeyondearth,393tgo,fritzvonamerika,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:55:00 2015 UTC,Thanks. These look like a good place to start.
civbeyondearth,393tgo,greenlamb,2,Tue Jun 9 18:09:04 2015 UTC,"The civfanatics forum is the ultimate resource. I started out with Kael's modders guide, and its not too bad a starting place, although it is quite outdated.  I highly recommend you to start modding with civ5, because currently civBE modding is at its infancy. There's a lot of similarities for modding both games, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of activity finding out & fixing the differences in CivBE. I know because I started out modding civ5, and am currently trying to mod CivBE, and its harder because you probably won't be able to search for an answer on the forums, and just have to figure it out yourself.   In any case, feel free to PM me if you have any issues and I'll try my best to help."
civbeyondearth,393tgo,greenlamb,2,Tue Jun 9 13:38:04 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll probably just start with some basic stuff to get my feet wet. Eventually I wanted to give BE civs custom buildings and/or units like in Civ5. Probably have them unlock when the highest affinity reaches a certain level or something like that.

That being said, the code is complex beyond my current understanding, so I might be wrong.  Tldr: No, the code doesn't show that its affected by difficulty."
civbeyondearth,38tmlk,greenlamb,3,Sun Jun 7 04:12:31 2015 UTC,"All right, thanks.   And a quick follow-up question: Were you able to glimpse if setting it to abundant creates more hexes with resources, a larger quantity of resources on existing hexes or both?"
civbeyondearth,38tmlk,greenlamb,3,Sun Jun 7 06:27:01 2015 UTC,"Both. I just checked the code to confirm my previous statement, and it's right. Abundant will create both more hexes with resources, and more resources per hex."
civbeyondearth,38rnut,mbrochh,14,Sat Jun 6 05:50:36 2015 UTC,"""If you want peace, prepare for war"". In other words have a sizable standing army and let other civs know you have them. Make friends and allies. That means giving favours and doing lots of business. Play on lower difficulity levels - AIs get more aggressive the higher you go."
civbeyondearth,38rnut,snsibble,3,Sat Jun 6 06:49:52 2015 UTC,"I'm playing on Normal already and the AI is stressing the hell out of me. I just lost again, this was my second try for Emancipation and the AI once again won before me just a few turns away from my goal :/"
civbeyondearth,38rnut,gonnacarryyou,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:54:32 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you can't avoid war. Even if you are the strongest, most advanced and ahead of everyone, once you get close to victory the AI will attack you. The best way will be to destroy whomever is leading on you and prepare for an attack on all fronts. I have been playing vostok for sometime now and about to move to the next level. Usually i make combination of two affinities but pick the afinity that you have the resources to support it. Example: float stone is for purity, Firaxit is for supremacy and xnomass is for harmony. Just plan in advance your strategy built new cities when healthy and you'll do fine."
civbeyondearth,38rnut,gonnacarryyou,3,Sat Jun 6 21:57:45 2015 UTC,"I just made it. I played Emancipation victory on Normal with 6 players.  I went for all the defensive stuff. I had the warmonger general guy next to me. Every few turns he told me that he can just laugh about my cities. I also had Hutama right next to me who chose a different affinity and hated me because of that.  They both came sneaking up on my borders all the time but never attacked because I always kept two armors and one ranger right next to each of my three cities.  I also chose all the culture bonuses at game setup and sprinted through Industry virtues, then Knowledge, then Military. I was always 3 or 4 affinity level ahead of everyone else.  At some time the general declared war on Hutama and Hutama begged me for resources which I gave him. He still kept telling me that my affinity is just wrong but he stayed neutral. At that time we even shared open borders. I made sure to never spy on him.  In the endgame, nobody dared to attack me because while I was building the gate, I filled every tile of my country with the heaviest mechs Firaxite can buy you.  I also placed one destroyer next to each city but I guess I was just lucky that the other three cultures were too involved with themselves on the other end of the world to try a sea-attack, which would have put me under considerable stress."
civbeyondearth,38rnut,adhal,2,Sun Jun 7 06:39:18 2015 UTC,"Nice! good job :) what level was that? When i played vostok and was 10 turns away from contact victory, all the AIs attacked me at once.

civbeyondearth,38rnut,ThePizar,2,Mon Jun 8 01:15:58 2015 UTC,"Way I started playing on normal is start with a tectonic scanner, artists, and a soldier. Send my explorer out on auto immediately and use my soldier to scout near me and help nab all the pods I can.  First build is the relic, then a worker, then a clinic, by this time I've had 3 virtues and put them in the tech tree (blue) going down the science and culture gains fore the first 3, then switch over to military tree sticking to the left for the increased damage to aliens and science bonus on killing aliens then straight down the middle till I get the free affinity level and -50% upkeep costs on military units. Then go back to tech tree for the -40% science and culture increased costs per city.  I only build 2-3 cities and grow them keeping health positive as much as I can, normal with 1 soldier and 1 gunner at each to start.   Do not attack aliens unless you absolutely have to, let them be on your border, one more thing any enemies will need to cut through.  Try to build on sea so you don't need roads to connect cities, though if you go supremacy you don't need to worry as they get free road upkeep.   Also try to get computing and build spy agency that get spies out early. You can normally get a free small army if you get them out before other civs have spies, and if not you can Spam siphon energy all day for tons of energy.  Other than that focus on whatever victory you want and research the techs you need and any affinity techs for the affinity you are... Oh and prioritize any science, culture, and health buildings.  Soon you will be so far a head in affinity level you will be able to wreck 8 of their units with 1 of your own. I have used this strategy with every sponsor and every win condition for easy wins. Only one that was close was my first win with was purity, and that's because I hadn't perfected it. Came down to my ally building a beacon, but since I was so far ahead in affinity level I just backstab her and destroyed the beacon with little effort. 4 factions then declared war one but my tanks just roflstomped them."
civbeyondearth,38rnut,ThePizar,7,Tue Jun 30 05:46:24 2015 UTC,"You mention Nodes - I take it you are a Supremacy player?  If so, upgraded CNDRs gain a quite significant home turf combat boost that may be a good defense force against a Warmonger.  Plus the AI is generally opportunistic: they prefer to declare war only when they vastly outnumber the enemy. (Because they are terrible at war.)"
civbeyondearth,38rnut,cannons_for_days,3,Sat Jun 6 08:40:38 2015 UTC,Ok so that means if I keep enough units on my own territory they will be less likely to declare war?
civbeyondearth,38rnut,cannons_for_days,3,Sat Jun 6 10:53:17 2015 UTC,That is the standard rule in both Civ games. The advisor menu (I forget if BE has one) should tell you the relative strengths of your opponents.
civbeyondearth,38rnut,PublicPool,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:53:31 2015 UTC,Hmm I don't know anything about an advisor menu. Do you mean the leaderboard which shows a score for each culture and how they think about me?

civbeyondearth,38oqc8,gyrobot,7,Fri Jun 5 16:26:02 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add in - if I'm not mistaken, the journey to Planet takes roughly 400 years.  Al Falah's ship doesn't have cryo.  Now, suddenly, all the absurdity makes a lot more sense - they almost certainly have very poor archives, so they've preserved essentially random bits of culture that they piece together as best they can.  Though I do question the llama part.  That actually manages to make less sense than the vulpix and the GDR; it's fairly easy to see how those might work their way into a myth, and in Civ V GDRs actually exist anyway."
civbeyondearth,38oqc8,Drake55645,3,Sat Jun 6 02:36:02 2015 UTC,"they almost certainly have very poor archives   Why? If they have the tech to develop and run a space program and a high population density voyage, then they should have the tech to keep digital records, archives and other data."

I hope that they put whoever is in charge of writing and/or curating content for the website in charge of Civ:BERT's writing. Systematic Destiny and the sponsor blogs are great and pretty much what I expected to see more of in-game (whether in the pedia or in quests)."

She had to be aware of what happened when the original Rome fell - despite the best efforts of everyone who wasn't pillaging, that collapse led to a huge loss of knowledge.  Her ""Canon"" was her attempt to preserve as much knowledge and culture as possible - and yeah, she chose what went in there, but when you're in charge of trying to save culture, you're going to choose what you consider the best.  In that regard, she's probably my favorite character after Hutama."

Supremacy cons: Low food yields, low culture yields.     Purity pros: Great military power, very high food yields, high culture yields.  Purity cons: Low science yields, low energy yields.     The game really does reward wide play, so to play tall you have to do specific stuff. Basically, if you want to play tall -- play with a Purity focus and a Harmony minor to pick up the Harmony level 2 science building, make sure you go knowledge to make-up for Purity's insanely weak science-game, and then hard focus Purity's insane number of food yield and growth techs (no definite order):     1) Biospheres: +10% food carry over.  2) Vertical Farming: +1 Food/Energy to farms.  3) Bionics: +2 food, +1 health Biowells (beware of purity's weak energy production)  4) Social Dynamics: Civil Creche (+2 food building, quests with +5% city food)  5) Nanotechnology: Nanopasture (bar none the most important purity growth building.

civbeyondearth,38lvz1,gorbachev,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:38:18 2015 UTC,Main benefit to going tall imo is that it's easier to exploit the ai when you don't have any contested borders. Whatever that's worth.

civbeyondearth,38lvz1,ArgonV,6,Fri Jun 5 09:22:33 2015 UTC,"If you go from the center of the tech web towards social dynamics, there's all kinds of health techs you can grab. If you go wide, you're also likely to have a lot of trade units, as well as military units. There's virtues that give +0.5/+0.2 for each.  I usually go through barely positive health at the start, to slightly negative health during expansion to very positive health at the later game. As long as health does not drop below -10, you're good."
civbeyondearth,38lvz1,ArgonV,2,Fri Jun 5 13:22:53 2015 UTC,Playing tall usually puts me at a disadvantage in regards to strategic resources; having a few cities makes it difficult to get enough of those.

civbeyondearth,38lvz1,radarerror30,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:51:52 2015 UTC,"There is some benefit to player tallER, though lots of cities is better than a few big ones.  Usually, advantages pile up once your secondary cities reach pop 10, due to trade routes being way too good.  If I'm going for academy spam, I'd probably want taller cities, - those academies need population to work, workers to build, and thorium reactors (among other things) to pay for.  I'm not a believer in the ""you must pick this virtue path to play correctly"" school, and I don't always beeline for Colony Initiative.  If I'm going heavily down Knowledge, it's worth it to go tall until picking up tier 2 virtues which reduce expansion costs on science/culture.  Strategic resources aren't that big a deal, as long as you have a quantity of everything you'd need - usually no more than 3-6 of each resource type (bar geothermal)."
civbeyondearth,38lvz1,jabontik,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:20:27 2015 UTC,"Tall early, wide late. One benefit to Tall play is that when you get to around +30 health, you get stuff like +20% science, food, culture."
civbeyondearth,38lvz1,Catch_66,-1,Wed Jun 17 19:06:28 2015 UTC,"I have never played a game of Beyond Earth with more than four cities in my colony and I typically do just fine with only three on Gemini and Soyuz difficulty against AI. Winning with two cities is also feasible on these difficulties, however you may have to start cooking settings to succeed with One-City challenges on Gemini and up. On Apollo difficulty and in multiplayer, wide colonies are the way to go for redundancy, Production, and wide-scale Academy spam since Health penalties are not particularly prohibitive of reasonably-paced expansion or large numbers of cities. In short, though playing tall is still completely feasible for the most part, there is just not much incentive unless you absolutely must micromanage everything, and even then you often put yourself at a competitive disadvantage (land, resources, population).  Games in Beyond Earth generally do not last long enough for Specialists to come into serious play as they did for late game tall civs in Brave New World, and even so their outputs are lousy in comparison to tiles in Beyond Earth, with the notable exception of Culture output Specialists. Specialists are another mechanic I feel Beyond Earth needs to revisit for either balance or potential redesign in Rising Tide."
civbeyondearth,38gqqp,mbrochh,6,Thu Jun 4 02:33:42 2015 UTC,"Each city can grow three rings from the city.  Each population does take 2 food so if you want the city to grow large you will need to settle grassland areas or build near multiple food resources.  You can also create internal trade routes that give food, large cities tend to benefit more than the smaller cities will.  Farms and Biowells are good sources of food as well, you can also get improvements to farms through tech, but not quickly.  Personally most of my land is used for farms/biowells unless it is a hill or special tile.   If I don't run the prosperity tree, I will usually have an energy deficit the entire game, so I don't purchase much.  But spy missions will keep my energy reserves from dropping to zero with the occasional emergency purchase.    The city management screen can be left on auto, but if your people are starving you can lock tiles in.  I tend to lock a few tiles that I always want worked, but other than that I will let it auto as it tends to pick food first.    Yes only the tiles that are being worked by the population will be contributing to the city output, the city also has to culturally expand to the tile you want to be worked (this can be accomplished through gold as well)."

civbeyondearth,38gqqp,wes_the_rad,2,Thu Jun 4 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"Most games I leave actual worker management on auto and determine what tiles get worked by how I improve them.  (The auto-improve function for work units is garbage anyway.)  If you have a very large city and it's stagnating or starving, chances are pretty good the only way you can keep it growing is unlocking some new tech that will give you a building that adds food or adds more yield to tile improvements.  The one exception to this is the satellite that improves the food yield of your tiles (I forget its name and what tech it's attached to, but I know it's attached to a Supremacy tech sort of in the lower-right corner of the tech web).  If what you really want is a bigger empire (rather than a more specialized, or more productive one), you can just cover your territory in those and watch your food production skyrocket.  (I believe it's most efficient to make sure the city tile itself is covered before the tiles its citizens are working, but I could be misremembering that.) The other advantage of this approach (over other techs that increase food yield) is that you can just have one city cranking out all the satellites and have every other city just working on whatever.  It does, however, prevent other satellite coverage in your territory, so it's costing you the opportunity to improve energy or production in those tiles, or to do other things with your satellites."
civbeyondearth,38gqqp,cannons_for_days,2,Thu Jun 4 03:27:07 2015 UTC,"When my empire gets to a certain size (9/10 cities) I gradually start changing the focus in the larger cities to be food production. I'm not an expert, but if you do this for 5-10 turns there appears to be a lag period between the end of food focus and starvation, I just keep them all in a routine of food focus."
civbeyondearth,38gqqp,Cardo94,2,Thu Jun 4 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"Growing Cities large starts with good city placement.  Places with basic resources that increase food yield such as Chitin, Fruit, etc. are usually excellent places to found cities around.  Poor city placement is usually the cause of small and or starving cities.  Overly hilly terrain, Tundra, Desert (not including floodplains), are going to have problems growing cities to substantial sizes."
civbeyondearth,38gqqp,HermETC,2,Thu Jun 4 22:07:31 2015 UTC,"There are building that will help a ton more than farms, I rarely build farms and support cities of 30+ pop with ease. Grow labs, Food Creche, vivariums are a few off the top of my head"
civbeyondearth,38gqqp,adhal,3,Thu Jun 4 22:28:44 2015 UTC,"There's no real need to manually assign workers: just set a certain desired output (production, research, gold, growth etc) and the game will automatically work the best combination of tiles for you (including buildings inside the city that allow citizens to work there).  This means that if you have a city near a lot of hills (for production), after you reach a certain population size (enough citizens to work the hill tiles that you can reach), you can just set a Production focus for that city and forget about manually juggling citizens.  Yes, each citizen consumes 2 food, so making it work a 2 food tile will only feed itself.  This, as you may have guessed, is a terrible idea.  You'll want to get something more than just sustenance, otherwise that citizen might as well not exist.  There are ways to do that, but primarily you'll want to look into tiles with resources on them, eg. copper, algae, basalt.  Your citizens can work tiles that are up to 3 tiles away from the city.  Therefore, when choosing to settle a new city, always look for as many resources as you can fit within in the 3 tile radius.  Sometimes you'll need to set up a city just to get access to a single strategic resource (eg. Firaxite, petroleum), but most of the time you should be able to fit at least a couple of other resources in as well.  If a city stops growing, that's fine!  Just let it stop growing.  As long as it isn't starving - and if it is, just build a single farm nearby and let the computer fix the starvation via automatic citizen assignment - your city should be contributing a net positive effect to your empire.  There's no point to working a 2 or (sometimes) even 3 food tile if it isn't doing something else in addition to that.  Finally, take note that there are a few research upgrades and buildings that will boost the food output of tiles.  If you follow the Purity tree, for instance, you should be able to get some sick upgrades for your farms.  Harmony has lots of buildings that give you food and health, while Supremacy...  well, Supremacy doesn't really care, because Supremacy has giant robots."
civbeyondearth,38cwah,mbrochh,13,Wed Jun 3 12:08:21 2015 UTC,"Let's say you have a resource with 6 Firaxite and have created the relevant upgrade on it so that it's now showing as a resource you can use.  Let's then assume you want to build a unit that requires 1 Firaxite.  You build it, you will then have 5 Firaxite left, and your unit.  You then build 5 more of these units, meaning you now have 0 Firaxite.  However, the part I think you're missing is that should any of these units die/get deleted then you will get that firaxite back. Assuming one of the above units gets eaten by a siege worm, then your UI should show you have 1 Firaxite available and you'll then be able to build another unit that requires it, likely to replace the one you lost.  Think of it as a limit on the number of things that you can have - they are not ""lost"" permanantly once in use - they are just in use and if they stop needing to be used by something then you can use it on something else."

civbeyondearth,38cwah,thatbloke83,3,Wed Jun 3 14:56:23 2015 UTC,If you hover over the resource at the top it should give you some information about where what you have is being used. There's a unit overview setting that you can see that will list your units too.

What happens if I don't recover my Firaxite income? Will my units and buildings be destroyed by the lack of this resource?"
civbeyondearth,38cwah,thatbloke83,3,Wed Jun 3 15:32:06 2015 UTC,"as /u/BasedGunt said - your units will get a major combat penalty if you don't have enough of the resource they require (IIRC it's a -50% modifier) - note that this will apply to ALL your units that require that resource, not just a select few.  Buildings you already have will continue to function, however if you really need to build a unit that requires firaxite then selling a building or two that uses that resource is a viable option."
civbeyondearth,38cwah,BasedGunt,3,Wed Jun 3 18:34:17 2015 UTC,Your units won't be destroyed. If you have a below zero Firaxite income then the units that use Firaxite will have their combat strength lowered. Not sure how it affects buildings though.
civbeyondearth,38bdrr,mbrochh,9,Wed Jun 3 03:02:33 2015 UTC,"Specialists allow you to take one of your population out of the city tiles around your city to fill a specialist slot to produce a decent quantity of a specific resource. Depending on the type of slot, each Specialist adds a certain bonus to your city's outputs. For example, moving a citizen to a Grower spot increases the total Food produced by your city. You can move citizens between Specialist spots and your city tiles whenever you want.   To see your Specialist spots, click the ""Show Buildings"" box in the city screen. Any buildings with Specialist spots will be at the top of the list, and have a blue circle for each spot that building affords. Click one of those spots to move one of your citizens from the field to that spot, and click in a filled spot to return a citizen to the field."
civbeyondearth,38bdrr,Last_Gallifreyan,5,Wed Jun 3 03:29:29 2015 UTC,For starters they are almost never worth using over improved yield tile improvements unless you are playing a custom faction that gets bonuses to its specialists. By the time you have the tech and population to support these buildings you will almost always have improved your city tiles to the point they out produce them. The only exception to this I've found is the CEL Cradle and Holosuite because culture tile yields are so low in BE.
civbeyondearth,38bdrr,Saris_Kai,4,Wed Jun 3 14:13:37 2015 UTC,That's one thing that annoyed me about BE. Why even have specialists if there isn't a way to really make them worthwhile like in Civ 5?
civbeyondearth,38bdrr,LikeGoldAndFaceted,5,Wed Jun 3 14:59:48 2015 UTC,"Some of them still fill a function though: for shorter periods of time, it might be worth it to absolutely maximize a certain yield, and to do it quickly. Examples include maximizing production when building a wonder and maxing out science to get to a tech quickly for a unit upgrade. If you're switching farms to academies to maximize sience it will leave you waiting for it to complete (not to mention crap yield on the tile while it has no improvement), while switching them to a specialist is instant."
civbeyondearth,38bdrr,robothelvete,3,Wed Jun 3 18:33:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true, I just wish there was some more strategy around them, like great people in Civ 5 and social policies and wonders that gave bonuses which made them as productive or close to as productive as a lot of tiles. Not that I necessarily want them to copy Civ 5, but I think there's something they could do with them that would fit the theme and add some more complexity to the gameplay."
civbeyondearth,38bdrr,LikeGoldAndFaceted,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:12:15 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. Unfortunately I felt that way about a lot of aspects of Beyond Earth.  Why are specialists in this game? There are a thousand buildings that offer specialist slots -- some that do nothing BUT offer specialist slots -- and yet it's never worth using any of them.  Why are virtues even in this game? (They don't particularly interact with the affinities, technologies, victory conditions, terrain, or other civilizations.)   Why are trade routes in this game? What is it about colonizing a new planet means that everything needs to revolve around convoys? Because of the stupid always-accessible fence quest, you don't care about aliens/barbarians. The only interaction is that miasma blocks trade routes, but that's not really interesting, just annoying."

civbeyondearth,389t2k,DefiantMars,7,Wed Jun 3 02:33:51 2015 UTC,"Glorious! Truly beautiful across the whole board.   Agency - Sadly this is the military that I have the least understanding of. For Synergy and Ascendancy, I have clear image of how the units function but not for Agency. The best I can see, they have one of the stronger defensive lines.     Beacon Squad: Does it get the both the defense and adjacency bonus? If so, that really makes me want to reassess the condition of the existing Affinity units. If you have a line of these units, they will be tough to crack. Auxiliary: The Markov Eclipse and Surrogacy Tech really feel like they're meant to be Agency. Having units that do full damage when wounded without requiring the wonder is great. They may be named Auxiliary but they a valuable asset to an Agency military. Skyfortress: Floating platform of doom. 3 range and double attack. Really strong unit. I don't have much else to say about this unit other than it will me a menace. Thank the stars you've only given it one move per turn. LEV Carrier: Its like a Helicarrier... but for space! I do like that is an aircraft carrier that can actually attack back. And the fact that it is a hover unit means you can mobilize aircraft beyond the extent of other affinities. A very impressive support unit indeed. This does make me want curious as to what affinity upgrades the non unique units would look like, including the aircraft.   Ascendancy - I like this set of units. There is an interesting dynamic between the units. The Gorgon can basically be used to tank with the Pandoran Hive providing healing. Meanwhile you can coordinate strikes with Steel Worms. And mop the stragglers up with Nemean Packs. Basically attrition is your friend.     Nemean Pack: The Decepticon from the beginning of the Transformers movie comes to mind. These guys will be doing the clean up. Gorgon Assault Walker: The passive healing is really potent and it will need that durability to stand up to all the punishment the other affinity units can throw around. Pandoran Hives will boost their survivability even more. Pandoran Hive: I love this unit. Its something different, a true support unit rather than a frontline or artillery unit. Steel Worm: I have a question about this Worm. When it says tunneling, does that mean it can ignore enemy units in front to hit ones   behind? What does that mean in terms of positioning?   Synergy - All the hover units! It feels to me like this affinity's military takes advantage of powerful area denial. The fact that they all hover means you can exploit terrain.     Phoenix Squad: The mobility on this unit is awesome. I haven't playd XCOM, but I'm familiar enough with it to make me smile at the similarity. Terradrone: I hate alien Drones so much. Giving it healing and a human direction makes me scarred. Rocktopus: We discussed this briefly on CivFanatics. The Rocktopus makes sense as a Hybrid unit but its so out of the way. Adjusting it beyond the miasma removal would probably be a good idea. Thunderhead: While derived from Terran Electric Eels, to me the Thunderhead invokes imagery of Oriental Dragons; as some were said to have the ability to control the weather. Manipulating the seas and winds.   Edit: It occurs to me that the Hybrid Affinity forces are noticeably less conventional than that of the Primary Affinities"
civbeyondearth,389t2k,DefiantMars,4,Wed Jun 3 00:29:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Unfortunately due to strange character limit rules that lower the allowed amount when editing, I can't edit the OP.  Still, criticisms welcome!  Admittedly I tried to design bonuses mostly to fit the flavor of whatever unit I thought up, so they may need to be more coherent.    Agency   Beacon Squad   I had trouble thinking of what perks the Beacon Squad should have, but yes, it would get both bonuses.  And it may need toning down, but they are mostly meant to be durable line holders.   Auxiliary   I wanted them to be a very aggressive unit to differentiate them from the Beacon Squad.  I also got carried away attempting to write background for them.   Skyfortress   To be fair it does have a somewhat weaker attack to make up for its strengths.  Its a bit like a SABR that flies with less range, and specialized at softening units at full health.   LEV Carrier   Soon after I learned about the LEV Destroyer I wanted a LEV Carrier.  Affinity perk upgrades tend to be somewhat generic, but I'm unsure of whether the affinity hybrids don't have should be an upgrade option.  Not sure if it makes thematic sense.    Ascendency   Nemean Pack   That decepticon was a fine mecha-panther indeed.  I was hoping to make this unit an opportunistic partner to other forces.   Gorgon Assault Walker   Its meant to go down to focus fire while serving as a reliable frontline unit.   Pandoran Hive   I kind of wonder if its heal/ damage effect should be non-stacking.  Not sure how it would work out.   Steel Worm   Yes, it could ignore units in front to hit units behind.  If it kills the unit, it takes their place as a melee unit.  If it doesn't, it returns from whence it came if a unit is blocking the consecutive tile.    Synergy  I may have gotten carried away with Floatstone equals flight here.   Pheonix Squad   What do you think of the bonus for used movement perk?  I'm somewhat concerned that this unit may be too similar to the Terradrone.   Terradrone   Ideally they are meant to be an airforce combo with Pheonix Squad, serving as the cleanup crew.   Rocktopus   That could work, and some of the techs requirements may need to be changed to those easier to access.  Or perhaps those distant techs could receive other bonuses as well.  What do you think of the Chimera?   Thunderhead   I hadn't thought of that, but it makes a lot of sense.  Their name mostly comes from them resembling the shape of a cumulonimbus cloud in flight.    The Primary Affinities have some quirks when their units upgrade, and generally I like more asymmetry.  In my opinion the upgrade base bonuses should be active immediately to boost asymmetry and make combat interesting.  I'd prefer unique units to be more about the utility they bring to the table than simply more combat strength."
civbeyondearth,389t2k,DefiantMars,2,Wed Jun 3 02:56:22 2015 UTC,"Beacon Squad The issue with the  is that its the 1st Affinity unit, so the initial bonuses might be too powerful. Compounded with how fast the game can go, its probably overboard. But it is a shame the these tier 1 units become so irrelevant so quickly. Some general rebalance of the base game is welcomed.    Auxiliary I appreciate the Pedia entries. They give the unit a reason for existing and help describe the societies that created them. I think its fine.    Skyfortress Its kind of like a Civ V unit with Logistics and Range but specialized  at hitting units instead of cities. Even if is not innately powerful. The hovering combined with double attack make it strong. Its artillery.     LEV Carrier I like it a lot. Despite being LEV units, the Purity military is not focused on Air control. Between a Flying Fort and Levitating Aircraft Carrier I think its really cool. Speaking of aircraft, I've been trying to come up with an idea to diversify air units. Having 1 type of unit for interception, bombing, and sweeping and only having 3 jets per city is a bit disappointing. Right now I'm trying to make bombers. But we can discuss this later.      Nemean Pack: I definitely see the opportunistic part. Between the Gorgon's front lining, and the Worm Strikes. These guys will really murderize anyone who managed to survive the first attacks.    Gorgon Assault Walker With that ability, this will be right up there with the tier 3/4 Soldiers.     Pandoran Hive I don’t know either, but it would make people think twice of attacking into that radius.    Steel Worm Okay, so it behaves like I thought it would. Cool. I can just imagine.     Some of the older colonist may remember the horrors of a Siege Worm attack. You know, before we made peace with the native fauna. But even that pales in comparison to the directed fury of a Steel Worm strike! First you hear a low thrumming beneath in the earth, then it turns into a terrible cracking sound. Suddenly the ground shatters and a worm, blatantly engineered as indicated by its sleek and optimized form, breaches the surface. The cybernetic augmentations built into this metallic titan clearly indicate that is the product of an Ascendental society. Earth and stone are scattered in every direction. Metal structures and vehicles transform into shrapnel in an instant. The heat released from the Worm’s bionic skin and vents bakes the surrounding area and can be felt from a mile away. It can be a truly terrible sight to behold. I’m just thankful that it's our engineers who are calling the shots.       Phoenix Squad Its a little similar. I like the bonus, but it might not be strong enough. The +1 movement when full health is cool. With the similarity to XCOM already, I wonder if they’d be too strong if you could reposition them like the Paratroopers or XCOM units from Civ V, where they can be dropped off outside of your borders? I’m a bit concerned about how late this comes, since you’ve placed it in Mobile LEV… hmm.  Terradrone The Phoenix/Terradrone clean-up is very apparent. I like it, they just scare me. Giant bugs with Floatstone shells, that repair their biochemistry by eating metal, stone, and flesh alike. Awesome, but the background for a Sci-Fi horror movie.    Rocktopus Maybe if the Rocktopus only occupied the tile it is on in the orbital layer but its firing radius didn’t interfere with other satellites it would be worthwhile. Since you’ve removed the miasma from it, maybe it would be okay? That way it is still blocked by existing satellites in terms of deployment, but not when it comes to actual firing.    Thunderhead I love a good natural phenomenon as a naming scheme. But I like to imagine that one of the scientists who developed this creature was obsessed with the tales of Old Earth dragons he read in the archives. A Thunderhead really would be an amazing sight to behold.      Chimera As for the Chimera, it is nice to have instant Miasma. Thought it begs the question of other modes of spreading the substance across wide areas without the Rocktopus. I suppose Miasmic Condensers just become that much more valuable. Double attack is really nice. If I’m reading this right it can target tiles with allies in it but it merely applies Miasma. Can it “attack” vacant tiles or does it have to have an enemy or allied target?      I agree that the Unique units should be… well unique… and most could probably turn into more specialized and interesting units. Like the Aegis could increase the effectiveness of infantry, CNDRs and CARVRs could become better at defense and urban combat respectively. The Xeno Titan, LEV Destroyer, and ANGEL are pretty unique, as is the SABR."
civbeyondearth,389t2k,DefiantMars,2,Wed Jun 3 04:46:37 2015 UTC,"The Beacon Squad's perks are probably the least thematic of the lot, so I wouldn't mind retooling them.  (Though as stated I cannot edit the OP due to strange character limit rules.)    I like that Steel Worm scene.    Perhaps the Phoenix Squad could be upgraded to +20% strength per used movement point?    The Rocktopus not blocking other friendly satellites seems fine.    Yes, the Chimera would be able to attack vacant tiles.  It could be used to spread Miasma over areas quickly.    As far as uniques being unique goes, I still kind of wish levitating units was more strictly a Purity/ Purity hybrid thing."
civbeyondearth,389t2k,DefiantMars,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:16:01 2015 UTC,"I'm going to start with levitating units; for the most part I agree with you. But I think there is a necessity for 1 non-unique affinity unit to have the ability to traverse terrain in such a way. I think having the Tier 4 Combat Rover doing that is acceptable, for counter-play reasons. As for the unique-ness, there is more than enough content to make them more diverse. But perhaps there needs to be another affinity unit or two.  I'm not quite sure what you'd do to the Beacon Squad, its a conundrum.  I had fun with the Steel Worm, its just a more colorful characterization of your Pedia entry. :D  I was thinking more about the Rocktopus and I'm thinking that on the Orbital Layer it only occupies 1 tile, but can still shoot out to 2 Range. That way you still need to find a place to position it on the orbital layer, but you have way more flexibility. It might break Orbitals though..."
civbeyondearth,389t2k,WhatGravitas,2,Wed Jun 3 20:41:22 2015 UTC,"It still feels a little cheapening.  In the same way Harmony has, or should have, exclusive rights on ""Miasma is good"", Purity should at least be the clear leader in LEV tech.    I like the idea of more Rocktopus range to get more use out of them and the orbital layer."
civbeyondearth,389t2k,DefiantMars,2,Wed Jun 3 20:46:54 2015 UTC,"It still feels a little cheapening.   It probably is. There is a delicate and incredibly annoying collision between thematic, unique, and ""cool"" versus balance and counterplay.  Does Tier 4 Artillery float too? I can never remember. If so maybe that can be removed on the non Purity types?"
civbeyondearth,389t2k,DefiantMars,2,Wed Jun 3 22:04:13 2015 UTC,I guess at very least the LEV Tank and LEV Destroyer outclass other levitating units.    I forget honestly.
civbeyondearth,389t2k,Mekanis,3,Wed Jun 3 23:35:18 2015 UTC,"I wish Autogyros actually produced a hovercraft unit. It doesn't really make sense as the prerequisite tech for the CARVR. To me the tech sounds like it could make for a potential Agency unit. Actually, that might solidify a type of ""air superiority"" military style. I don't know how that applies to Agent Society, but I think its kind of a cool idea.  Its really hard to move things around in the Tech Web, because some prereqs thematically need to come before others. I have no idea where to move this autonomous networked AI chassis without maintaining a level of research equivalent to the other Tier 3 units. I feel you've done a pretty good job with the required techs to produce these units."
civbeyondearth,389t2k,Konahrik13,3,Thu Jun 4 08:47:25 2015 UTC,"Autogyros really feels like it should be a tech tier earlier, though, even going by its own description."

civbeyondearth,37va6k,lilgamefreek,14,Sat May 30 18:15:41 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone. I just completed the first release for one of my larger mod projects that completely revamps the game's culture and virtue system. It increases the virtue count to 84, the majority of them new and not seen in BE before. However it separates these 84 virtues into 12 Social Engineering choices, not all of which can be adopted simultaneously. Players will have to make choices of which to adopt, when to switch, as well as face the diplomatic consequences their choice has.  Heavily influenced by the Civics and Social Growth systems of both BE, Civ5, and SMAC, the system combines the best elements from all three. The mod features a similar 12 Social Engineering choices and 4 categories from SMAC, but each choice has been heavily reinterpreted, including an entirely original category ""Diplomacy"" that replaces ""Future Society"" from the older game. The system affects Diplomacy outside of this category as well, with each leader having their own in-character aversions and preferences, and will judge your policy making with approval or disdain.  The ability to switch trees takes after the early Civ5 system, allowing players to change their Social Engineering choice to a conflicting one at the cost of a virtue, 2-turns of Martial Law, and the de-activation of their previous tree's virtues. Switching back later will cost a virtue to re-adopt, but all previously adopted virtues will return.  The reason you may want to switch trees is that BE's synergy system has been repurposed into a ""Shortcomings"", negative effects that get stronger and stronger as a Social Engineering choice becomes more developed. If a shortcoming becomes too disadvantageous, players have the option of switching to escape the shortcomings of their current choice with those of another.  This is the first release and the mod is nowhere close to a finalized state. All feedback is welcome and there are several updates I already have planned. Alternate download links are available at the bottom of the Steam Page. Thanks you for your attention and I hope you enjoy ""Social Engineering - A Culture and Virtue Overhaul"".  ps: I'm not settled on names for.... anything."
civbeyondearth,37va6k,jaredjeya,8,Sat May 30 18:16:25 2015 UTC,"This looks brilliant. I love the inclusion of martial law, reminds me of my Civ 4 days!"
civbeyondearth,37va6k,Velrei,3,Sat May 30 20:10:58 2015 UTC,"I am actually not sure what causes Martial Law in base BE (it is by default in the game system and I take advantage of it). I didn't play Civ 4 in the past, so this connection has come as news to me from another person as well. Pretty neat considering the influences from all the other games I have."
civbeyondearth,37va6k,Elardi,4,Sun May 31 02:38:32 2015 UTC,"Taking control of enemy cities, or switching from a puppet to a normal city, is the only way to get Martial Law in base BE, I believe.  Love the Mod btw, I should finally have time to try it tonight."
civbeyondearth,37va6k,jankan001,5,Sun May 31 20:20:31 2015 UTC,"So one route benefited economy and culture, but at the cost of Military uni maintenance or something. In a time of War you can switch to focus on a system that benefits the military.   Right?"
civbeyondearth,37va6k,Drake55645,3,Sun May 31 00:03:58 2015 UTC,"That's the idea. The diplomacy choices in particular are intended to be tempting for the player to switch around from time to time. You need to spend a virtue to make the switch though, so sometimes you need to wait a little for you to get enough culture to do it first."
civbeyondearth,37va6k,Drake55645,1 point,Sun May 31 02:40:36 2015 UTC,I've played a little bit with this mod and I'm really loving it. This is how virtues should be! Really well done! I'll also try to remember to leave my feedback when I've played a little more with it.

civbeyondearth,37va6k,shitcock55,6,Sun May 31 04:10:21 2015 UTC,"Posting what I wrote on Steam  Overall Reaction I playtested this mod today and it was absolutely great.  It defines my civ so much better than the cookie cutter Harmony/Purity/Supremacy affinities.  Working with those I felt I had the first really distinct civ since I've been playing beyond earth.  But I noticed that having these virtue choices, in addition to the affinities made it a richer experience.  So props for getting that feel just right.  I am really excited to see where this goes and how it can push more of the STORY feeling I loved about the first Alpha Centauri.  Worked great, felt great, can't wait to try it out some more.  Mechanics Overall the different stats of the virtues seemed to be just fine.  None of them seemed to out of control.  Further playtesting will help me get a feel for them.  Some of the things I noticed was I never got a lot of conflict or cooperation developed in this playthrough from differing virtues.  No one leader seemed to have a problem with my choices.   One thing I missed was clearly seeing what affinities people had.  As it is I only get a message when someone is pursuing a similar virtue to mine and approve of my choice.  I assume I also get a message when I pursue something they hate but it didn't happen during my game.  Again I wish I saw what others had, even from a story standpoint it would flesh things out for me.  At the same time I was disappointed that another civ with the same virtue as me was not more open to an alliance or a cooperation agreement.  I expected that they would be but instead they turned me down at every turn.  I guess I'm just wanting a little more interaction between similar and differing virtues.  Bugs Early in the game when I opened up the diplomacy window I would see strings of code hovering in the box furthest to the right, the one where it tells you if you have a cooperation agreement with someone or if they have the same virtues.  I was also denounced quite often like some others have noted and it didn't show in the records.  Ideas I kind of wish they would make comments about my planned economy or my pluralist politics in the same way that comments are made about me going Harmony or Purity.  Maybe a Free Market Economy civ starts making threatening remarks when I won't trade the resources I am hoarding or a Cooperative civ trying to convince me to make peace with someone I am at war with.    Or maybe there is a quest where someone I allied with early on is going a different route virtue wise and they are asking me to be more in line with their ideology.  You could even play off of the divide between a Police State Supremacy civ and a Pluralist Supremacy civ.  One is Big Brother while the other is the power of Free Thought powered by internet communications.  If certain civs chose fundamentalism, like the russians or indians, it would be interesting to see comments about their specific religions like Russian Orthodox or whatever the Indians are practicing now.  Or maybe going into how the Brazilians are fundamentally all soldiers and won't be broken by their enemies.  Anywho to conclude the sky is the limit with this mod.  The ability it has to develop the story telling in game is astounding.  I love it.  Thanks for the great mod!"
civbeyondearth,37va6k,gunnergoz,2,Mon Jun 1 02:43:26 2015 UTC,"One thing that I immeadiately notice is that the AI befriends everyone (at around turn 40 everyone had already a declaration of friendship). It seems rather unlikely that this is a coincidence, could it be caused by too much AIs going into the cooperation tree? here's a picture of infoaddict showing the overload of friendship. (not that I'm a facist, but you know, destroying civilisations is rather entertaining)"
civbeyondearth,37va6k,jankan001,2,Mon Jun 1 16:57:39 2015 UTC,I'm getting the same thing.  I'm pretty sure its this mod because I played a game without this mod (everything else was the same) and everyone was back to hating each other.

civbeyondearth,37va6k,ForerEffect,2,Sun May 31 04:44:39 2015 UTC,Can you let me know what other mods you are playing with? Compatibility issues often arise in the most unexpected places.
civbeyondearth,37rko0,CreepyMaleNurse,2,Fri May 29 20:40:32 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of bugs when it comes to the leaders in diplomacy. F.e. just today they always told me 2 different greetings at the same time. Sometimes, they're just muted. Besides the sound issues, I can't confirm any memory leaks or crashes, though. I tab out pretty often and sometimes leave the game running in the background for an hour and never had a problem.   From what I've seen @your dxdiag, you could and really should upgrade your Realtek Audio drivers. They're ancient.   If this doesn't help, I'd definitely check the temps of my rig/the entire cooling and clean it from dust if necessary. I'd also take a look at the S.M.A.R.T. stats of the system HDD + the one where the game is installed (if not the same). Last but not least I'd check my RAM with Memtest86. Running scandisk on the HDD isn't wrong either.   Better safe than sorry."
civbeyondearth,37rko0,KrazeeXXL,2,Mon Jun 1 00:18:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed the old audio drivers after I put up the dxdiag. I have since updated them and have installed the latest video driver as well. I checked the integrity of the HD (via S.M.A.R.T.) and did a Memtest, based on your advice, and they all came up good. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game, verified game file integrity via Steam, but I'm still getting the crash. Thanks for the answer tho."
civbeyondearth,37rko0,KrazeeXXL,2,Mon Jun 1 17:22:39 2015 UTC,I should've asked this earlier: what mods are you running?
civbeyondearth,37rko0,KrazeeXXL,2,Mon Jun 1 18:19:45 2015 UTC,"Actually I'm running it vanilla. I usually wait to see how a game runs before I mod it.  I'm actually entertaining going back to the legacy version of the game. I started playing it after the latest patch came out, so I want to see if something in the patch doesn't agree with my system. It's worth a shot, I guess. Noting else has worked."
civbeyondearth,37rko0,KrazeeXXL,2,Mon Jun 1 20:04:30 2015 UTC,"What also comes to mind is the Anti-Virus. Put it into gaming mode (if it has one) and also put the game into trusted applications. Since the game switches to some 3D graphics @diplomatics when it's usally a 2d environment, heuristics may kick in.   Other than that, the only problem I had with the game was in the very beginning due to a modified monitor driver (75hz instead of 60).   That's all I have for the moment."
civbeyondearth,37rko0,longa13,2,Tue Jun 2 08:29:30 2015 UTC,"You've done yeoman's work and I appreciate it. You've given me more feedback than the people over at 2K. Unfortunately, my AV is disabled when I play and I have a plain ol' 60hz monitor. After the latest driver update for my GeForce, its more glitchy than ever (thanks Obama). The text boxes on-screen are pixellated and sometimes the terrain is not rendered properly. I have tried other, more graphics-intensive games, and the card sings. This game just straight-up hates my system."

Dynamic Leader Traits: Players and AI Leaders alike unlock new Traits through gameplay and activate different combinations to respond to the changing world. These dynamic sets of Traits also provide benefits and add to the new Diplomacy system, governed by the new Fear and Respect attributes. New, Enhanced Diplomatic Options: Shape the diplomatic landscape by using political capital to upgrade your traits, change diplomatic relationships, and leverage the benefits of your allies’ traits. New Sponsors: Four new factions have been added to the game including Al Falah, nomad explorers descended from wealthy and resilient Middle Eastern states that possess a rich cultural and commercial heritage. New Artifact System: Collect and combine powerful relics to unlock new perks, unit upgrades, and buildings for your faction on the new world. New Hybrid Units: Affinities are competing visions for the future of humanity. By investing in multiple Affinities, rather than specializing in just one, players can unlock special hybrid Affinity units and upgrades. New Biomes: Two new world types have been added. Primordial worlds are rife in volcanic activity and the chaotic landscape of a world still forming.

The thing holding me back is that the food bonuses early in the game seem to make the health problems worse.

I usually start construction of the colonist unit when my first city is around 4 population (give or take) and whenever I finish the first few crucial builds (clinic, relic if not using artists, maybe another scou, etc.)  There's no natural wonders in BE, which makes getting cities up to build those quickly less important (I'm looking at you National College). You can really start building cities whenever you feel ready as long as you don't take too long.

BE has some great things, but when compared to civ 5 with expansions its falls short, but its still a good game.  The tech web is a bit daunting at first but its not that complicated after you spend a couple games with it. There are 3 ""affinities"" and all 3 of them require one specific resource each. Harmony requires Xenomass, Purity requires Floatstone and Supremacy requires Firaxite.  I suggest that after you start a new game you look at what is the most abundant resource of those 3 around you and then choose to follow the affinity associated to that resource.  Having an affinity will help you decide what to research on the tech web, theres many technologies that will have a symbol for your affinity, and you will definitively want to have those.  Also, you should research most, if not all, of the technologies near the center of the web.   Consider the leaf technologies a bonus, only research the leaf technologies youre interested in.  Every building has a ""quest"" associated to it. After you build a building some amount of turn will pass and a screen will appear making you choose something. For instance, You can build the ""Ultrasonic Fence"", this is a building that prevents alien lifeforms from invading the space around your cities. After X amount of turns a quest will pop up asking you how would like to enhance your ""Ultrasonic Fence"", you can choose from ""+1 to the fence radius"" or ""aliens do not attack your commercial convoys any longer"".  Just play a few games even if you are not sure what you are doing and things will fall into place eventually."

civbeyondearth,36lm6f,Galgus,4,Wed May 20 08:03:47 2015 UTC,"Some interesting ideas, but the Harmony ones of turning the aliens ti red against your non-Harmony enemies sounds very OP."
civbeyondearth,36lm6f,El_Barto_227,7,Wed May 20 09:20:24 2015 UTC,"To me its just part of making the Aliens a real asset for Harmony.  Besides, players like me may have all but wiped the native resistance out come late game."

civbeyondearth,36lm6f,DefiantMars,4,Wed May 20 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"This is a really minor thing, but the wording bothers me a bit. With Replicant Integration; if I'm not mistaken Citizens generate 0.75 Unhealth, not 1. So the Health cost would be reduced by 33% or 1/3 and not halved. Oh, and it says Level 7, not 9.  The level 6 Harmony devotion bugs me. It feels like it would give a lot all at once. Anyway, it bugs me that there is no way to improve forest tiles in BE. I think if we had the ability to plant forests or something at some point in the game it would be more useful, especially if abilities like +1 Food, +1 Culture existed.  The level 10 Harmony; I know that whenever you found a city on Miasma, the city gets rid of it. You can't put Miasma back in the base game, can you?  I definitely appreciate the names you've chosen for the Hybrids."
civbeyondearth,36lm6f,DefiantMars,3,Wed May 20 10:26:41 2015 UTC,"That's what I get for making this list too late at night, thanks for the catch.  I also may have kind of thought Citizens cost 1 health.    Honestly I went for theme first and balance second on these, the bonuses could probably use a lot of polishing.  How would you divide level 6 Harmony?   It's competition also seems strong, but maybe I'm underestimating hyper wide play.    The Alien Ecology technology allows workers to spread Miasma and the Miasmic Condensor satellite to do it over a large area.  With this system spreading Miasma everywhere would be a key part of what makes Harmony stand out, on top of the best expansion potential.    Thanks for feedback on the names, I felt they needed a unique label to feel like their own secondary affinity."
civbeyondearth,36lm6f,DefiantMars,3,Wed May 20 21:36:51 2015 UTC,"Replicant Integration is an impressive ability. It doubles your effective health and then rewards you for the excess.  For the Level 6 Harmony effect, I think the +1 to all yields is bothering me. Which is kind of silly to get worked up over. I don't know, I'm not a Civ Veteran so I'm probably the last person who should be talking about balance.  I fully support making miasma a more integral part of gameplay. Mostly its a physical obstacle until you have the means of removing or being immune to it.  I agree with labeling the Hybrids. If they're truly meant to be their own ideologies, then they should be named. I enjoy the points of agreement and contention you've created. Personally, I resonate most with Synergy. Sort of meeting the planet halfway, taking the component parts of both Humanity and New Earth and making something that is greater than either alone. Synergy :D  But I appreciate the built in narratives of Agency and Ascendancy. I particularly like the ""happy ending"" of Agency's Replicant Integration."
civbeyondearth,36lm6f,DefiantMars,2,Thu May 21 00:02:32 2015 UTC,"The best expansion potential and, at least, very strong population growth were the main strengths I wanted to give to Harmony.  Since they adapt as much as possible to thrive on the new world, they should come to outnumber those of other affinities.  Miasma is an easy tie-in to planetary research and Harmony becoming somewhat distant and alien to the other affinities.    Back when I was thinking of a Harmony civ I could support, I thought of it in terms of adapting for the colony's benefit without putting the planet on a pedestal.  Synergy takes that further with Purity's enthusiasm for terraforming to try to make the world into a utopia of sorts for those altered to interface with it.  I kind of like the idea of Synergy having some UU's that appear to be hybrids of new world and Terran creatures - maybe even trying to fabricate something in the image of a mythical creature.    The Firaxis announcement on S/P made me think of Reploids from the Megaman X/Z/ZX series admittedly - and I like happy endings."
civbeyondearth,36lm6f,DefiantMars,3,Thu May 21 01:49:09 2015 UTC,"Yield are nice and making improvements the focus of Synergy makes sense with the theme that you've painted, but it feels rather mundane compared so some of the others. Unfortunately, I'm at a loss for suggestions in their stead, so... shrugs. I love the idea of Neoscaping though.    I would find it incredibly amusing if Synergists attempted to recreate creatures from Old Earth's mythologies using genetic design; things like the dragon, the unicorn, the griffin, the chimera, and the llama :3  I never played the X/Z Megaman games, but I had friends who did.  With Ascendancy, I imagine there would be incredible diversity in a city; an ultra-metropolitan society. It would be amazing to see some art for that."
civbeyondearth,36lm6f,DefiantMars,3,Thu May 21 05:35:50 2015 UTC,"I did get rather repetitive with the bonuses for it, but I'm not sure what else to give them.  The affinity mostly focuses on having extremely strong cities near the right resources, but it may be better for it to be more broad.    It fits their vision well: viewing the world as a blank canvas for whatever they want and taking inspiration from old myths for biological weapons.    If you are handy with an emulator and the genre appeals to you at all I would at least recommend the first Megaman X: it's a classic in my opinion.  The Zero series had a somewhat darker outlook that played to human/ reploid relations though; and each of those series has its own spin on the gameplay.    I could definitely see that for Ascendancy since they are all about toying with their genetics and augmentations.  There could be all sorts of folks in their cities."
civbeyondearth,36lm6f,Yama951,3,Thu May 21 07:28:06 2015 UTC,"If I'm reading this correctly, Ascendancy has a Specialist focus and Agency has a Population focus. I'll have to think on a suggestion for Synergy.  I definitely think that Neoscaping is the strongest thematically. It vaguely makes me think of the Moai UI for Polynesia, with the stacking culture with adjacency. Which is interesting to think about considering the title ""Synergy"".    Just watch out for those llama inspired war machines."

civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Galgus,19,Tue May 19 03:49:54 2015 UTC,"Overall I just think they should ""evolve"" over time to scale with the pace of technology like Civ 5 barbarians did. Right now they're way too hard in the early game and way too easy in the late-game, which just isn't fun."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Russeru,10,Tue May 19 14:33:08 2015 UTC,Barring Siege Worms spawning in the absolute worst location they feel easy in the early game as well.  That said I wouldn't mind them evolving and growing stronger - be it by the planet's reaction or Harmony's meddling.
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Darthkill,3,Tue May 19 19:58:11 2015 UTC,"that would be pretty nice, harmony affinity lets you choose buffs for alien units, or tech that lets you breed aliens of choice to roam around their ""home"""

civbeyondearth,36g9gm,robothelvete,15,Tue May 19 12:25:33 2015 UTC,"Besides, lore wise, how is it possible that every single planet you come to is inhabited by the exact same aliens?   At the very least they could re-skin them for the different biomes."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Yetanotherfurry,10,Tue May 19 14:49:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with aliens being quicker to anger but honestly I think they need to tone down early on.  Hear me out now, the other day I spawned directly south of 2 side-by-side nests, and for the first 50-70 turns I simply couldn't go north because there were so many aliens and I was still trying to develop my civ so I didn't have the industry to spare to push them back. Then after I finally dealt with them and started to expand north I had to deal with the nests respawning right next to my new city, and instantly threatening to overrun it.  Basically I think spawn rates should be lower early game unless frenzied aliens are turned on."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Yetanotherfurry,7,Tue May 19 14:14:09 2015 UTC,"I've had it the other way around recently: I land ready to kill some wildlife for science and the nearest nest is quite a ways away.  I like Aliens being a barrier to expansion, but I think the game could benefit from some normalization on average distance from the nearest nest.  In my opinion it would be ideal to expect to need at least a small army to push them back.    It's also generally a good idea to either clear Miasma over cleared nests or keep a sentry nearby to watch it."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Yetanotherfurry,4,Tue May 19 20:06:33 2015 UTC,"imo 2-3 units should be enough, but I went through at least 5 just getting those 2 nests cleared, and the aliens still occupied every other tile for a good 20 tiles north of that. It would have been almost a non-issue if I hadn't spawned on a coast with water to my east, another coast 4 tiles to my south, and the KP to my west, but as it was my first few cities were ridiculously cramped."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,robothelvete,4,Tue May 19 20:09:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe 2-3 to fend them off and clear a first nest, but I'd like to see Aliens become considerably more dangerous and aggressive in response to nest clearing.  If the Aliens only start reacting when they have been effectively exterminated from the Aggressor's territory, they aren't much of a threat."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Zoythrus,3,Tue May 19 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"that depends on the map, there may be a lot more nests that the offender will have to clear later, in which case they should be more of a threat at that point, but they shouldn't be able to completely ruin a player's start."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Zoythrus,1 point,Tue May 19 20:26:13 2015 UTC,"I rarely see more than two nests in close enough proximity to a player to be an eminent threat - maybe one on the other side a ways aways.    This may be a bit extra, but I'd like fighting Aliens to be seen as a risky opportunity rather than a chore.  Ideally I'd change the odd energy bonus for clearing nests into a food bonus in the nearest city as a boon to early city growth.  I'd also modify Survivalism to grant food equal to the Alien's power in the nearest city upon killing one as well as its current combat boost - though perhaps the combat boost could be reduced.    Might should be about more than direct warmongering in my opinion, with that risky way to get a lead on the competition."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,sistersin,7,Tue May 19 20:37:39 2015 UTC,"Of course, the more notable perk for Harmony colonies would be the Aliens aiding them in wars against those that reject Harmony.   Yes please! Another interesting mechanic would be to have aliens be more of a unit resource middle or late game. Something like being able to convert certain (allied) alien units to a Xeno Swarm/Cavalry by paying energy, or having a nest on your territory to be able to build a certain unit.   And yes, local aggression would be a really cool thing if they pull it off right: anger the aliens to make them frenzied and attack a neighbour etc."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Llys,2,Tue May 19 14:48:24 2015 UTC,"I think aggression should generally be global, but I like the idea of some things that locally anger them.  Perhaps there could even be a unit made solely to draw them to a position and anger them - like a Psi Emitter from Starcraft.  It would be gloriously underhanded, and bring a severe diplomatic penalty."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Disparanoia,7,Tue May 19 19:56:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm under the assumption here that the idea of the aliens is to be a threat for the first half of the game, but less of a threat during the second half. I'm perfectly fine with this sort of setup, honestly.  Still, I would like to see the aliens have some sort of use during the second half of the game. That, plus having different aliens for different biome types (even if it's cosmetic), is all I want."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,BodaciousGhost,7,Tue May 19 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"I'd also be fine with that, though I'd want them to be a real asset to Harmony.  I think it would be fun for a high Alien population to give Harmony a significant edge: potentially giving other players a gameplay reason to want to exterminate them.  Different aliens for different biomes would be amazing even if it was just cosmetic - at very least they could skin them differently.  On the same note they could make Harmony's colors match those of the Aliens if they wanted."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Davidshky,4,Tue May 19 19:52:16 2015 UTC,"Harmony should always blend in with the planet, but that requires a ton of art assets."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,thePenisMightier6,5,Tue May 19 23:41:43 2015 UTC,"Sentient aliens maybe in line with the ""Stations"" we have now, so small trading partners who react to the players alien aggression or lack there of."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Addfwyn,5,Tue May 19 14:09:56 2015 UTC,D. Aliens need to be an actual asset to Harmony civs later on.   This is my biggest hate in the game. I play peaceful and wanted harmony to be so much fun and it just turned out to be pointless. Not only will aliens still be aggressive towards me for most of the game I can't even clear them out. I also told myself I would never play the game again without this being changed.
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Addfwyn,3,Tue May 19 16:17:45 2015 UTC,Their docility and general uselessness late game also makes them annoying for players more fond of war.  It's just not fun to fight them when they don't fight back.
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Seriyu,5,Tue May 19 19:54:05 2015 UTC,"I want aliens to be sort of like an extra civ that cannot win the game.  I dont want a diplomatic screen either, but i want to be able to interact with them. How about if i give them x resources they are happier with me, eventually moving away from my path, if i help them against another civ that is killing them they become my allies. I could kill them to harvest them at the expense of them becoming very hostile towards me, and other civs may chime in to help them.  Im not sure how it would be the best way to do it, but i dont want them to be barbarians, i want them to be a single big city state."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,burrowowl,3,Wed May 20 06:51:42 2015 UTC,"Right now they're basically an external constraint on building wide since otherwise it would be more powerful than building tall for basically every faction. They then become pretty much obsolete by turn ~100-150 except they keep fucking with sea trade for a while.  So, I'm hoping for a lot."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Kill_Welly,6,Wed May 20 08:24:44 2015 UTC,"If they won't simply have a playable alien civilization, it would be cool if they make aliens an actual threat even late game. Perhaps the aliens are intelligent, and from their raids on your cities and outposts, they begin scavenging your technology and adapting it to their own purposes. Eventually they build one mega nest that becomes a serious threat to human existence on this planet."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,burrowowl,2,Tue May 19 12:31:52 2015 UTC,"I kinda wish the aliens were divided into a few randomized ""factions"" ( I know they're kinda supposed to be a hive mind with the planet but there could be like rogue groups or something.) that could have different standings with each faction + humanity as a whole and maybe use a few different units (could depend on where they live).  Like you have one group of aliens far north that absolutely hate you because of your expansion/aggressions while the rest of the aliens are still neutral-ish.  This could also make it possible to try to piss off the aliens near your enemies while still being on decent terms with your own local aliens. Maybe harmony could have some sort of ""anger the aliens"" ability/unit   I also think that the ultrasonic fence should be changed so that instead of simply blocking aliens it should either hurt them and/or nerf them when they're too close to the city."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,Kill_Welly,2,Wed May 20 05:15:22 2015 UTC,I agree with most everything you posted.  But I'd honestly be happier if they were more agressive and changed depending on the biome.
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,burrowowl,1 point,Mon May 25 03:20:17 2015 UTC,"As far as the ultrasonic fence, I think it should only work on ""green"" aliens.  Once they get a bit annoyed at you, they should be able to charge through the fence because they are angry enough that it won't stop them.  Sorta like how dogs can get through sonic fences if they really want to."

civbeyondearth,36g9gm,burrowowl,2,Sun May 24 05:04:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that Alien nests forming on cities would really make sense, but I would definitely like to see them be a real threat when angered.  It could be interesting if Miasma spread somehow, though - perhaps a Queen Alien unit that would attempt to spread Miasma and form Alien Nests on Xenomass."
civbeyondearth,36g9gm,asdbnmrty,1 point,Sun May 24 05:16:34 2015 UTC,"I never liked barbarians in Civ games. To me it's just too much an all negative RNG, especially early on. All it serves is a random chance, early in the game, to stifle your early growth and make you lose the game three hours later because you got unlucky.  Barbarians is a crappy game mechanic. I do not want to see them turn aliens into super barbarians. If they do turn aliens into super powerful barbarians, I will be turning them off, either in the options menu, if it is provided, or in the config files if not.  Now if they want to move in some completely different direction, I'm all ears. But as far as the current implementation goes: X% chance to kill a trade unit, colonist, or cut off a direction of expansion is just an annoyance that adds nothing to game play."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,MDRAR,68,Mon May 18 20:45:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think Firaxis was greedy or sneaky with the lackluster BE release, I just think they were too timid.  I commend them for not dropping the game, but they have some trust to earn back in their designs with the upcoming expansion.  It is nice that updates will also come to the base game, and it is unrealistic to expect major support for a game without payment for new content."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,Galgus,22,Mon May 18 22:21:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. Pretty much this. I don't think Firaxis has been underhanded in shipping DLC. It's not like it was a surprise and I don't think that Beyond Earth was ""half finished"" or even that buggy compared with most games. Yes, it had balance issues, perhaps more than it should have, but that's mostly fixed with a few patches: no harm no foul. Nor do I think that this DLC looks like a patch and ""should be free"" it looks like real content and given how many hours I played Civ 5 I have no problem paying money (even premium prices) for great games.  My issue is basically that I don't think it was that great a game. As others (even the designers) have said: it wasn't ambitious enough. It lacked compelling story. The mechanics were good, but no so great that I felt compelled to play it more than twice. My problem is that my reaction to the BE DLC is ""do I have any interest in playing BE again?""  Fundamentally I think the problem for me was that I had been playing Endless Legend beforehand. And for an ""indie"" game, Endless Legend had more polish, story and character than BE did. I think of Civ games as full of multimedia and atmosphere and BE just felt like a budget game."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,davidogren,5,Mon May 18 23:38:23 2015 UTC,"I think BE could be a great game if they pushed their mechanics and themes to their full potential.  For example, Aliens should be more than a minor speedbump to expansion - a threat early, an option for indirect warmongering, and a Harmony asset later."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,Galgus,6,Mon May 18 23:50:11 2015 UTC,"i agree that they were not ambitious enough.. but honestly thats how i felt about civ 5 before the Xpacs.  i feel that firaxis has the time with this xpac and most likely one more after this.. to really bolster the game.  Civ 5 is amazing after its Xpacs and patchs, and i really think we owe firaxis the chance to do the same with BE"
civbeyondearth,36esfw,Trespasserz,3,Tue May 19 03:47:36 2015 UTC,"I dream that they would give us a second expac as well, in the hopes that Rising Tides would be like Gods and Kings (and Warlords, perhaps) in terms of game quality increase, and a second expac could be Brave New World (and Beyond the Sword) quality. That'll depend on whether a, the sales of Rising Tide are strong enough to justify another expac, b, an off flagship game in the series could be deemed worthy of a second expac, c, if the civ in space seems to draw enough following to justify splitting resources or delaying the next flagship (Civ VI), and d, if the core isn't deemed too outdated to the pcs of whenever it would be released (the core is now, what, 5 years old?).  It could happen, but that's a lot of considerations."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,19683dw,7,Tue May 19 06:09:27 2015 UTC,From what I've read your comment regarding timidity is true. I hope they got their arses kicked by Ol' Sid and have pulled no punches with their expansion.

Firaxis listens, and everyone still complains.  Don't go through life complaining folks.  I'm excited to see the new biomes, and build empires entirely on the ocean.  It's going to drastically change how the game is played."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,burrowowl,9,Mon May 18 21:44:14 2015 UTC,"Not to mention what could be interpreted as mutable leaders over a single game, replacing diplomacy, crazy new colonists!  I've actually never played any Civ game beyond Civ2, though I own BE (lack of time). I did however purchase XCom:EU on iOS, played the crap out of it, then bought it on PC + XCom:EU. Wow I was blown away by that expansion. I'll buy XCom:EU on iOS as well, when I have more time.   Firaxis is the only studio out there today that feels to me like an old school studio (I mean as they were 15 years ago). I feel like they listen, they continue to support and improve titles post-launch, and they launch expansions that totally overhaul the vanilla releases.   Of course they charge money! I don't remember anyone complaining about Dark Reign's or Total Annihilation's expansion costing money!"
civbeyondearth,36esfw,WhatGravitas,21,Mon May 18 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"I still can't figure out the BE hate.  Maybe it's because I did not play Civ V. I have played all the other ones, though, including Alpha Centauri, a lot. A whole lot, back to Civ 1.  To me BE is one of the best ones in the history of the franchise. The affinity system and the tech web are great."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,Merhouse,24,Mon May 18 21:58:05 2015 UTC,"I think it just feels rough compared to Civ5, especially Civ5 right now. But it's as good as Civ5 at launch, if not better.  It had to live up to the complexity of SMAC and the easy access of Civ5 at the same time, it was an almost impossible tall order. That, plus being merely solid instead of great... and people felt let down.  I mean, I am a bit disappointed, it didn't capture the flavour of its own trailer, but I'm very happy that Firaxis is committed to the game and keeps working on it, it's what I expected from them and they didn't disappoint."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,Llys,4,Mon May 18 22:10:20 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I think you're right on point. I never played a Civ title until Civ V, and really enjoyed it even though I wasn't much good at it. I'm not quite sure what I expected in BE, but it really didn't do much for me.  That being said, no Fraxis hate here. I'm pretty much otherwise occupied these days, but when time and interests permit, I'll be there :)"
civbeyondearth,36esfw,telcontar42,1 point,Tue May 19 01:39:27 2015 UTC,I agree with what you said except I know exactly what I expected and I didn't get any of it. I'm a peaceful player so of course I'd want Harmony. Except in it's current implementation Harmony doesn't feel like living with the aliens in peace as much as becoming the aliens (while they still hate me). I also can't get over how 1 building makes it impossible to do espionage of 4 or 5 stars.
civbeyondearth,36esfw,Manannin,4,Tue May 19 05:50:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because I did not play Civ V.   That's exactly what it is. BE is not a bad game, but it is very similar to Civ V and not as good as Civ V. That's why people coming from playing  Civ V have generally been disappointed."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,Galgus,6,Tue May 19 17:07:28 2015 UTC,"For me, it's been some big gaps such as the complete lack of tech text that just made me feel cheated. They made the exposition and hid it away in the civilopedia where sadly too few people will read it, when in previous games they had voice acted quotes. plus the quests were lacklustre.  That said, I've mellowed significantly, and I suspect I'm going to mellow a bit more when I've got a newer gaming PC as I do feel the game looks good (and this expansion will add to that). The tech web grew on me, and the patches have helped.  It's still a very flawed game, but the expansion could fix it - I certainly like the look of the gist description of new four factions being a second wave: this could help get over the criticism that the leaders are basically accountants. I'd love to see a British leader akin to Sutler in V for Vendetta, a paranoid fascist who'd do anything to take control; all of the second wave being generally more battle hardened should give more tension, especially if the wave arrives 100 turns in with significant advantages."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,je_suis_napoleon,2,Mon May 18 22:41:49 2015 UTC,"To me its that Civ BE is always in the shadow of what it could have been.  The game had great potential that was mostly unrealized in many of its systems, which I'm hoping this update helps with."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,Leungmarkus,23,Mon May 18 22:22:54 2015 UTC,"CivBE is a damn good game. It has some issues that hold it back from being great, but I love it.  The tech web was ambitious as hell, and an awesome idea. The number of units were lacking, but sufficient. Diplomacy was a weak spot, which they are addressing.  Heaven forbid developers get paid so they can pay their mortgages. They had a great idea that was shock and surprise, hard to get completely right from the start. So, they gather feedback, and keep working.  To paraphrase the chairman, Software is an inherently iterative process."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,Wily-Odysseus,9,Mon May 18 22:06:03 2015 UTC,"Yes! You state what I meant but could not form properly in words - I live Firaxis because they iterate. Looking at their history, it looks like they're managed to find a way to iterate their games without falling into bankruptcy, which is wonderful for us."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,TwoTailedFox,4,Mon May 18 22:35:20 2015 UTC,"I've been sceptical for years, because of my hopes of the success of one my favourite games. I completely agree with OP, I'm excited about the next launch and will be a huge advocate of games like this as it actually makes you think. Keep up the great work"
civbeyondearth,36esfw,boxtears,8,Mon May 18 23:11:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I've spoken to the two lead designers of BE on a couple occasions and they're genuinely really passionate about this game. I think they're doing great, and I can't wait to see the game evolve."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,Robolenin,7,Tue May 19 02:02:47 2015 UTC,"As someone who has actually spent time working with 2K, I can say that they are insanely passionate about their work. Greed does not factor in what they do with studios like Firaxis.  The hate for this game is over the top and disproportionate. Sure, this game has criticisms, but it's only when a game gets the oxygen of a public release can parts of a game look, to the developer, as not playing out as they intended.  Stoked for the expansion, though."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,OrionBlastar,2,Tue May 19 01:44:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think Firaxis is greedy or sneaky, I'm not that cynical and I do think they thought they put out a pretty decent game.  But yeah, they have been known for going above and beyond ""pretty decent"" to give us a truly unique experience and I just didn't feel I got that with BE.  I really do hope they make up for it with this expansion and we see something more dynamic and engaging than what we got with the original title.  But I don't think I'll be pre-ordering this.  Sorry, but I'm going to be a lot more cautious this time around and wait to see what the reviews say.  By now, we shouldn't expect good games from Firaxis, we should expect great games."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,energyinmotion,3,Tue May 19 02:52:59 2015 UTC,"Here is a moderate view. BE was kinda fun, but unfinished. It will be fixed with a full paid expansion, which is disappointing to people who don't want to throw 60 bucks at the game to make it fun."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,aaOzymandias,0,Mon May 18 23:53:35 2015 UTC,"Video game companies are profit based. The first version of any game was basically rushed to market and needs improvement. In order to have money to pay developers to improve the game they have to sell DLC/Expansion packs that change how the game is played.  This is not the mid 1990s during the DOS Game age when it took longer for a game to come out and games were more finished and they released updates for free to fix bugs and change the way the game is played and add/remove features. Companies that followed that model went out of business when games went on the Internet and were 32 bit Windows based.   Firaxis has to earn money somehow, if they made BE perfect, there would be no need for the DLC/Expansion later on.   I quit playing BE and went back to Civ5, I'll wait for the DLC/Expansion to go on sale before I buy it as I spent too much money already."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,sistersin,4,Tue May 19 01:09:57 2015 UTC,"I came from Civ 5 to Civ BE. At first, yeah it sucked and I felt duped. I kept playing. Small updates/patches would be released, and it would improve the overall experience. Now I love the game as is.  I can't wait for the expansion.  This expansion will be well worth the money, as the game needs it badly.  Developers gotta eat too. Some of you need to learn the value of a dollar."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,jabontik,2,Tue May 19 04:20:26 2015 UTC,An expansion is awesome! These games usually get better with some post release love.
civbeyondearth,36esfw,Derkice,2,Tue May 19 08:15:25 2015 UTC,I actually prefer an expansion more than the trickle of DLC they did with Civ 5. I can only hope this is the first of a few expansions that enhance and expand the gameplay.

civbeyondearth,36esfw,The_Jack_of_Hearts,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:16:10 2015 UTC,"I've taken the approach to look at BE as an Alpha game, we are the testers to help the team truely create a great new game. A lot of potentially great games/game makers have shifted to alpha phases to support the development. Why can't Civ Devs get the same break? I've always enjoyed playing Civ, took a gamble when I pre-purchased the game. Wasn't totally satisfied, but true to previous Civ releases we have xpacs coming! I'm still able to enjoy the game, play it regularly when time allows.   TL:DR In a nutshell the dev team showed us a game design with great potential! Some found it lack luster, the devs are listening. Now we are getting more content, and polish! Will it meet expectations? Only time will tell."
civbeyondearth,36esfw,El_Barto_227,1 point,Tue May 19 14:33:44 2015 UTC,I would like to voice my mordaracy too. I did enjoy the game on release it could've been better in a quite a few place of course but I don't see how new content could possibly be a bad thing.     The state of of Civ V when it was launched  compared to what it is now is often brought up in this conversation. If people are turned off the game with loud skeptics then other interested players might not try it thinking it is a mess.
civbeyondearth,36esfw,19683dw,-1,Tue May 19 14:39:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, the expansion costs money. As it must. You might like to imagine that they should release it for free. Sure, Firaxis might be able to do this. But it would mark the end of risk taking for the studio. There is no way in hell those who must answer for Firaxis' bottom line will sit idly watching the devs burn time for no return.   But I'm entitled to a game that lives up to my expectations. This is America. I have rights.  Edit"

With a new oceanic aspect it almost has to be, since The Netherlands have the most experience in water management, the Scandinavians are sea faring by tradition and Germany can provide the technology and resources to propel us into space!  Hybrid affinities sound good too!"

But I really hope we see affinity differences in their progression. One affinity trns them into a single destroyer type unit, while another turns it into an even more numerous flotilla of scrappy little sea going zerglings. And one that maintains a middle ground.  And I don't mean on prime affinity lines, we are getting hybrids, so some could be amplifications of these ideas, or slight deviations.  Basically, we have six instead of three ways to go with the common units, and I really hope they are all distinct, and not just, ""this hybrid is half of this and that."""
civbeyondearth,36d08z,je_suis_napoleon,34,Wed May 20 22:13:54 2015 UTC,Heres to hoping that this will be as good as Brave New World for Civ V!
civbeyondearth,36d08z,pr0meTheuZ,6,Mon May 18 12:14:14 2015 UTC,I'd bet it'll probably be more like G&K. Though I guess that depends on if they plan to release more than one expansion.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,The_Jack_of_Hearts,6,Mon May 18 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"10 points says that the expansion after this one is called ""To Infinity and Beyond"" and focuses on Orbital stuff."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Zoythrus,14,Tue May 19 17:19:27 2015 UTC,I'm super excited about being able to expand into the water. I wonder if the A.I is going to be able to handle water based settlements. Currently the A.I. just ignores water based anything. Hopefully this announcement calms down all the people that were saying that BE has been abandoned.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,soldierras,12,Mon May 18 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"With the heavy focus on sea expansion, they have to have improved the AI's handling of water. We'll probably see an AI personality type parameter controlling whether a given sponsor is likely to focus more on water or land, so they probably won't all be great at playing the sea-faring game, but there should be some kind of improvement."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,tobascodagama,9,Mon May 18 17:12:22 2015 UTC,"One of the challenges with making solid water AI is that it's (generally) a different set of logic that needs to be brought to bear in addition to the land-based AI.  By making the sea colonizable, and adding a few new movement methods I'd guess, they might be able to simple handle water as a special case of land movement.  IIRC this was one of the motivations behind removing transports and letting units convert themselves to boats for water transport, how well it simplified the unit movement AI."

civbeyondearth,36d08z,Ripley_Riley,27,Mon May 18 12:27:44 2015 UTC,New biomes! Thank Meier. We need more planets to colonize.  4 new sponsers too? Good stuff.  Can't wait for more information and a specific release date.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Russeru,15,Mon May 18 12:35:30 2015 UTC,They mentioned in the livestream that the biomes will have some impact on gameplay rather than just basically being palette-swaps. Interested to hear more about that.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Ripley_Riley,9,Mon May 18 20:16:20 2015 UTC,"Oh my. That's excellent. I always expected more hostile alien worlds. The miasma thing was unique, but only felt right in the fungal biome.  Where was the volcanic eruptions, radiation, alien diseases, etc.? Hopefully Rising Tides will inject some danger into the biomes."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,EarthExile,5,Mon May 18 21:27:03 2015 UTC,"I would love it if Harmony adapted you to whatever the biome was. Miasma for fungal, desert conditions, airlessness, whatever. Of course it probably would have to be the same effect in all biomes, just different in appearance."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Russeru,27,Mon May 18 21:31:35 2015 UTC,Looks pretty good to me; naval combat and diplomacy are probably two of the weakest areas of the game. Here's to hoping that a Planetary Council and an overhaul to stations are part of the diplomacy improvements. Giving the existing and new civs some more personality would be very welcome too.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,ArgonV,4,Mon May 18 13:45:52 2015 UTC,"I would love to be able to tell someone: ""Attack that station, and we'll be at war!"", just because with the right virtues and enough trade, they can be very valuable, plus they can be in strategic locations somewhere. Maybe even being next to a station you're trading with, will heal units quicker per turn, depending on trade level, so you can use them as Outposts."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Russeru,3,Tue May 19 10:17:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's a lot they could do. Personally I'd like to see stations turn into city states after you trade with them enough.

civbeyondearth,36d08z,Drake55645,7,Mon May 18 20:04:00 2015 UTC,They said they'd be releasing a big patch for base BE along with Rising Tide.

civbeyondearth,36d08z,Archfiendrai,5,Mon May 18 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"There will be a big update to the base game with the expansion being standalone. Some parts obviously wont be in the patch, like the sponsors, but I'm guessing Diplomacy is one of the things that we'll get in the vanilla update."

civbeyondearth,36d08z,Galgus,7,Thu May 21 01:01:33 2015 UTC,"The updates and the expansion sound like they have a lot of potential, but that's also what I thought of the game initially.  So I'm excited and cautiously optimistic on this update.    I'm somewhat worried that there wasn't much detail on Affinities beyond hybridization.  I'd really like to see them have more of an impact on the game, more than Ideologies in BNW ideally.    I'm curious as to how biomes will play differently - that was a huge missed opportunity in the original game.    Sea cities could be very interesting or very boring to me - it depends on the mechanical differences.  As they said, it would be lame if it just turned the oceans into city spots with blue tiles."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,DefiantMars,2,Mon May 18 20:57:49 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit disappointed by the lack of details as well, but Pete made it seem like they were going to release more information in livestreams over the next several weeks (if I'm remembering correctly).  I still feel like the ""biomes"" are a gross misnomer.  Side note, I'm not a fan of the Purity/Supremacy Hybrid described in the livestream. Cinematic and Literary Media has made cautious of Human society supported by a robotic workforce."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Galgus,4,Mon May 18 21:05:03 2015 UTC,"They said something about actual play differences with biomes - which was almost totally absent in the base game.  That would be an easy, basic way to make the game more interesting if they do it well.    I'm more of a solid Purity guy myself, though come to think of it a thread discussing hybrid affinity possibilities could be fun.  I was actually thinking it could be interesting to have the hybrids take on different flavors with major/minor combinations - since I could also see an approach of making human like robots as a Purity/ Supremacy niche - beyond just working."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,ThePooBird,2,Mon May 18 21:10:59 2015 UTC,What about Harmony/Supremacy? Swarms of semi-organic automatons sound kinda scary too...but in the context of a game kinda awesome.

I mean, I think Purity itself is a worse idea, and frankly as close as something can get to blasphemy for me (humanity unchanging)."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Galgus,7,Mon May 18 22:31:18 2015 UTC,"Purity is wise enough to see the damage reckless changes could bring; and that human life trumps alien life.  Goodness, I'm hoping they do these hybrid affinities well to revive these old snarky Affinity discussions."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Velrei,4,Tue May 19 03:18:36 2015 UTC,"Purity only looks backward, and can't look forward to see potential.  (and yes, I agree on the snarky affinity discussions. I look forward to seeing you play ""hard mode"" on the topic. Because arguing purity is a natural handicap. Like humanity in it's current state ;p)"
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Galgus,6,Tue May 19 03:47:40 2015 UTC,"Purity is not totally opposed to optimizing the human form, but we see the beauty and potential of humanity as it is, without polluting our genetics with those of pests.  (Snark!)"
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Velrei,3,Tue May 19 03:53:17 2015 UTC,"They're only pests because you keep shooting them!  (btw, I'm totally going for Harmony/Supremacy hybrid in the expansion, I hope it's lore is well done)"
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Galgus,6,Tue May 19 04:06:18 2015 UTC,Harmonist propaganda! Colonial records showed that they attacked a nest research crew first!  They clearly cannot be trusted.  (I almost want to go Purity/Supremacy to roleplay a colony that creates robot AIs that act as human-like as possible - mostly because I love Megaman X and its reploids.)
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Velrei,2,Tue May 19 04:41:12 2015 UTC,"It was a setup! That nest research crew was made almost entirely of food! Clearly the Purity Military-Industrial complex was just looking for excuses to provide more specimens to brutally dissect in their lust for improved weapon systems. Also, public documents clearly show they had a deal to bring in dead specimens for a certain station known for it's ecological violations!  (Honestly the hybrid affinities make me feel RPing would be more fun, since the options are so much more open, can't wait for fall!)"
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Galgus,5,Tue May 19 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"Typical Harmonist outlook, letting sentimentality for insects trump scientific progress.  (My biggest hope is that affinities in general have more of an impact: currently it is mostly just military. I'd love to see them radically change how the game plays - pure and hybrid.)"
civbeyondearth,36d08z,DefiantMars,1 point,Tue May 19 19:47:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sympathetic to Purity's desire to preserve its heritage, but I highly dislike the blatant extermination of species to protect humanity. If you're supposedly about ""learning from the mistakes of our ancestors"" I don't think you should be driving New Earth species extinct."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Velrei,4,Mon May 18 22:47:44 2015 UTC,"I think that's what the Purity/Harmony hybrid will end up being: Humans should remain humans, but respect alien life, and preserve it."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,ThePooBird,1 point,Tue May 19 00:14:09 2015 UTC,Gaians ftw!
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Velrei,1 point,Tue May 19 05:24:59 2015 UTC,"Technically, everyone in Alpha Centauri ends up becoming one with the planet. So it's pretty much a Harmony/Supremacy bit with psionics thrown in.  Heck, halfway through the game you have Transcendi as units that are basically humans that become ai."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,ThePooBird,2,Tue May 19 18:24:28 2015 UTC,Philosophically I would totally agree...But every time I play I always end up exterminating the native life regardless of affinity.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,DefiantMars,2,Tue May 19 05:24:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like that issue is a form of design flaw. Aside from some tile blocking, there is no real reason to keep aliens around, if you have the force to deal with them. I too usually end up eliminating the aliens as I get paranoid about my workers being out past the Ultrasonic Fence radius and annoyed by Sea Dragons and Krakens threatening my sea tiles."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,ThePooBird,2,Tue May 19 06:10:17 2015 UTC,"Right. And even if you are playing as Harmony, you still have an incentive to kill alien nests to mine xenomass."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Galgus,6,Tue May 19 20:47:30 2015 UTC,"Really hoping we see a revamp on Alien aggression - they are basically only a speedbump to expansion at the moment.  My dream would be to see them swarming cities as a form of soft warmongering, with more major repercussions for killing them outside of one's territory.  In equal measure I hope that they can be real assets for Harmony civs."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Cobra613,4,Mon May 18 22:26:12 2015 UTC,I think they significantly improve role of aliens as opposed to being basically reskinned barbarians at the moment. Hopefully they make diplomacy with aliens possible! That would be cool!
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Disparanoia,2,Mon May 18 23:57:05 2015 UTC,I would love the aliens to be sort of a unique city state.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Cobra613,1 point,Wed May 20 11:01:35 2015 UTC,I know right! or even having them capable of constructing their own civilisation and actually winning in their own right. given their homeward is being invaded by hostile creatures! it seems only logical that they would try to defend their homeland!
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Galgus,1 point,Wed May 20 11:07:14 2015 UTC,I like how the Aliens react to all humans as one faction - at least until Harmony stuff comes into play - and I would like to see them be threats and assets at different parts of the game.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Cobra613,2,Tue May 19 00:08:55 2015 UTC,Yeah exactly! Playing a significantly more active role in defending their world. Currently they just become irrelevant once you've reached the 2nd-3rd unit upgrade. It should also be significantly easier to make them be happy with you if your nice to them or vice versa if your mean to them.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,CptBigglesworth,3,Tue May 19 00:32:31 2015 UTC,"I think there should be roamers that can be dealt with at tier 1 or 2, but have tough nests that would require a full scale war to deal with before tier 3 or 4."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Galgus,2,Tue May 19 06:59:25 2015 UTC,I like the idea of nests being significantly harder to attack relative to fending off attacking aliens.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Galgus,2,Tue May 19 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"I personally want to goad them into attacking, and potentially eliminating rivals by attacking them myself."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,reallyreallyrealyfun,4,Tue May 19 00:50:33 2015 UTC,Nice. Hopefully exactly what this game needs!
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Yetanotherfurry,2,Mon May 18 17:06:15 2015 UTC,"Given that BE was much more generous to coastal cities by giving sea tiles some great potential yields even without improvements, I think deep sea cities is a fairly logical expansion of that. That said though I hope they also add a new naval unit or two, spamming gunboats into infinity early game will no doubt get dull fast."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,DefiantMars,5,Mon May 18 20:31:22 2015 UTC,"If you look at this screenshot you can see the existing Gunboat and Carrier, but next to it are a trio of patrol boats and some sort of sealed vessel. From the livestream, it was stated that there is a new melee ship and a submarine. Also there is this quote from the interview article   [...] There's a couple of new Naval units—there's a naval melee unit, we brought submarines back so you can have your invisible hunter killers again. And then a variety of other changes to the existing unit catalogue to be more aquatic or to introduce more hovering units so you have armies that are amphibious so they can travel back and forth just fine. And there's a great deal more aliens. There's all kinds of new aquatic aliens, but their behaviour is totally different: the way they spawn, the way they live at sea, is totally different. You have new opportunities for interaction with them as well."" -David McDonough"
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Yetanotherfurry,3,Mon May 18 21:00:39 2015 UTC,good catch.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Cobra613,3,Mon May 18 21:06:53 2015 UTC,Safe to say i'm keen for this! the leader personalities looks great! Same with the oceanic expansion and the New graphics for the world looks great too! They seem to have taken everyones complaints on hand and really improved the game with them!
civbeyondearth,36d08z,sistersin,2,Tue May 19 00:34:19 2015 UTC,"The  Nomadic Faction seem really interesting.  But factions don't seem different honestly and they could use tweaking so they have better differences.  And  I spy at least 2 - 3 New resource type things. But no new affinity just improved mixing of original ones.  Which sort of happened with units..  The tech web needs restructuring, as people already say leaf technologies seem pointless unless you want x or y.  Cargo and Starship types need more options.  I'm glad we get two new world types but I hope they get some tweaks so you can tell terrain types. As really relying on mods for this feels kinda meh.  Now it honestly depends on what the development team actually does but I've always found them to be rather engaging with the fans / public  at least in my opinion.  I'd like some kind of (and like only) to be able to see certain buildings that you have like in other Civs   Maybe unique units for each faction but again one of those things I'd like but isn't necessarily essential.  They have said they will fix the ai for other civ / factions but at the moment favours are pointless."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,DefiantMars,6,Mon May 18 19:33:02 2015 UTC,"Well there is this line:   Dynamic Leader Traits: Players and AI Leaders alike unlock new Traits through gameplay and activate different combinations to respond to the changing world. These dynamic sets of Traits also provide benefits and add to the new Diplomacy system, governed by the new Fear and Respect attributes.   Which combined with an altered Diplomacy system, may eliminate the relative blandness of the factions. As for the Hybrid Affinities, they seem to be promising unique units for the in-betweens.   New Hybrid Units: Affinities are competing visions for the future of humanity. By investing in multiple Affinities, rather than specializing in just one, players can unlock special hybrid Affinity units and upgrades.   Edit: Here is a link to the Civilization Games page, in case anyone was wondering where these points were coming from."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,sistersin,3,Mon May 18 19:49:10 2015 UTC,But the hybrid affinity was kinda there already. But cool cheers
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Galgus,3,Mon May 18 20:17:50 2015 UTC,"They said something about how they look, so we might see some actual graphics to represent it.  I'm just hoping affinities in general have more of an effect on the non-military game."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,sistersin,0,Mon May 18 21:07:25 2015 UTC,Same though they do sometimes seem opposed to each other  alien cyborgs.... wait that actually sounds cool.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,DefiantMars,2,Mon May 18 21:21:04 2015 UTC,Yeah. It was kinda there before. This new thing looks like its fleshing it out and making them proper ideologies for the advancement of humanity.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,sistersin,3,Mon May 18 20:26:26 2015 UTC,"I hope we have something more for the end game as it feels,flat at the moment"
civbeyondearth,36d08z,DefiantMars,2,Mon May 18 20:37:48 2015 UTC,"I hope so too. Looking at the interview article, it would appear that they at least looked at the end game.   ""Well the base game tries to funnel you down a single affinity. The mechanics are designed to make that the cheapest way to play, and the victory conditions are aligned with those three affinities. One of the things we've wanted to do is support players who want to broaden their choices. They want to play a split or perhaps all three, and we've filled in the unit catalogue with new units, new unique units that support that. And at the highest end of our upgrade tree, we've introduced hybrid versions, so things like the ranged marine: these basic unit types now have additional options for upgrading and hybridising your approach to affinity. And we've rebalanced the affinity themed victory conditions to make them achievable by hybrid players. So this is really cool: each of those affinities definitely caters to a particular playstyle in the tactical part of the game. Introducing hybrid units is to help those tactics change and be augmented and supported."" -Will Miller   What this entails, we'll have to wait and see over the next weeks as they release more information. This expansion looks promising."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,sistersin,2,Mon May 18 20:53:10 2015 UTC,Well ill be watching well of souls and here for info I did compile it for the sub last time however it kept getting hit by filters from the mods so unless asked I won't be doing it again here.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,skepticscorner,2,Mon May 18 21:00:11 2015 UTC,Rising Tide. I too feel as though the Agents of Shield are keeping too many secrets from the rest of us.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Zoythrus,2,Tue May 19 00:37:39 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in the new hybrid affinities. We've been told how Purity/Supremacy is going to work on a philosophical level, but what about the other two combinations? How are they going to work out?"
civbeyondearth,36d08z,ExOsc2,11,Tue May 19 17:18:49 2015 UTC,"Nope. I won't buy it. I was so incredibly hyped for Beyond Earth, and encouraged several of my friends to pre-purchase with me. And what a waste it was.  There's no way I'd pay anywhere close to full for this. Maybe at a -80% steam sale some day. After what happened with the initial release, I hope many others too vote with their wallets."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,switch6lade,4,Mon May 18 12:57:34 2015 UTC,"This might be obvious now, but stop pre-purchasing games."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,ImperatorTempus42,14,Wed May 20 11:29:48 2015 UTC,So... why are you at this sub?
civbeyondearth,36d08z,xnaas,-4,Mon May 18 17:53:22 2015 UTC,"To build on that, it's a shitty practice to release fixes for your shitty game under the guise of an ""expansion."" Yes they're adding content, but I'd rather the game just be fixed since I already fucking paid for it. :/ Oh well. Here's hoping they don't fuck up Civ VI! :D  Edit: And before anyone jumps on me for it, yes, I realize there's a minimum of one large patch coming, but I highly doubt it will address all of the issues that need to be addressed. The first large patch didn't fix anything the community was upset about.  Edit 2: ""Anything"" is an exaggeration. Surely you all use exaggeration in real life in regular conversations, yes? :P I do know they fixed some things abut a lot of the major issues were ignored for awhile. Maybe they've been fixed now, I'd have to look into it more again. Been awhile."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,WhatGravitas,40,Mon May 18 13:13:09 2015 UTC,Wasn't C:V in the same state until they released an expansion?  Correct me if I'm wrong.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,xnaas,11,Mon May 18 14:17:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I'm happy to buy Rising Tide, especially if the 2.0 patch on its own is neat.  I mean I got 30-40 odd hours out of Civ:BE. Is that great compared to the several hundred I got in CiV? Nope. Does it compare well to every other non-simulation/strategy game? Yeah."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Raveshaw11,-2,Mon May 18 22:07:07 2015 UTC,"It was at least playable for more than 50 hours tops. That said, I don't condone what they did and are doing again."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Russeru,12,Mon May 18 14:43:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that it's right and maybe you'd think they learned from their mistakes, but just maybe I could see it where the community and developers had a different direction and it most likely happened again."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,RushofBlood52,3,Mon May 18 14:47:22 2015 UTC,"There are things that can still be improved with the game, sure, but as others have noted, the patches have fixed things and the game is certainly playable for whatever amount of time you want to dedicate. Like you (probably) I do not want to be giving them more money without a guarantee, but its hard to ignore history. The Civ 5 expansions made that game one of the best of all time.  The patches have fixed things and I am sure will continue to fix them. It is impossible to make the game perfect for each player, but as long as the base mechanics are there, the game is what you make it.   Regardless, I am excited for the expansion and will tune into the live stream today. Four is a good number of additional factors. The diplomacy overhaul is sweet (cooperation on research is nice), and I am also excited to see some of these ""hybrid affinities."" Of course, the naval component will be bad ass, but I want to see that first hand before I get too excited."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,xnaas,12,Mon May 18 15:45:31 2015 UTC,"The first large patch didn't fix anything the community was upset about.   Plenty of people were upset about the issues with wonders and trade routes, both of which were improved in patches."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,zaniety,23,Mon May 18 14:56:16 2015 UTC,"The first patch did fix things. They also have had other patches since then. Some members of the community are just whiney brats who will be offended by everything because they're petty.  Either way, they are continuing to support the game. I don't know what you want from them. You're just... wrong. Is anything they do ever good enough for you? They're delivering what you're asking for (and more with this expansion!) and it's just arbitrarily not good enough for you. Are you always just going to default to feeling wronged by Firaxis?"
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Robolenin,-6,Mon May 18 14:39:30 2015 UTC,"I'll admit, I haven't look at the game since the first couple patches. But you know what I want? For $50 I want a game that isn't broken on day 1. I want a game that looks like it had zero QA or anything done before release. Everything about the game felt cheap and like no actual love, effort, or thought was out into it.  I'm sorry that I want a complete game that functions better or at least as well as its predecessors."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,zaniety,8,Mon May 18 16:04:03 2015 UTC,"Zero QA?  I played two full games at launch and encountered zero game breaking bugs, a few graphical glitches (which were also in Civ V) and some long loading times.  Other people did experience more bugs then me, but they did do a fairly good job with their QA.  Their main problem was the implementation of their design choices.  Affinities are a great idea in concept, but it led to some issues in tech choices.  It looks like this expansion is going to fix that."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Robolenin,1 point,Mon May 18 18:27:24 2015 UTC,Did you play online or SP? Online BE was buggy af at launch.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,RushofBlood52,1 point,Mon May 18 23:27:27 2015 UTC,"No, just SP.  Like I said, I know quite a few people experienced bugs at launch, I was just taking issues with the OP I was replying to’s “zero QA” statement.  A zero QA game would not allow barely anyone on any configuration play a full game, at least not in this day and age."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,xnaas,1 point,Mon May 18 23:40:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, right. He's just being hyperbolic though, obviously it was playtested, just not enough. MP was unplayable for the longest time, and that's pretty much the only way I play the game, so I felt as though it really suffered."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,19683dw,11,Mon May 18 23:47:47 2015 UTC,My point is that they're not rightly upset and your post is indicative of that entire attitude. I come to this sub because I like the series. I don't want to come to the sub of a thing I like and see a bunch of children pull a bunch or circlejerked complaints out of their ass.  It does function well. It did work. There are patches. They are supporting it. I see tons of love and effort that went into this game. I don't know what you want.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,ezwip,5,Mon May 18 16:06:30 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the series too, I've been playing Civ since Civ 2 (never got a chance to play the first one sadly, need to go back and do it someday).  I had entirely realistic expectations going into Civ:BE. I wasn't expecting Alpha Centauri 2, I didn't bitch that it was ""just a mode for Civ V,"" or any of that shit. I expected Civ V in space. I got Civ V in space. But I got an incomplete Civ V in space. I can totally be disappointed about that, to try to invalidate someone's feelings about a game is childish. ""I'm not disappointed so you can't be!"" Really dude?  I'm glad they are still trying to patch the vanilla game but it's disheartening to see them taking the same path they did with Civ V and now setting a trend they will likely use for all of their future games. Would you buy other series if they used the same model?   Release ok-ish product that needs lots of work. Do some patches. Release expansions that add content and actually fix the game. ??? Profit.   I don't think very many people would buy very many games if most games worked that way.  I get that Firaxis is a business and their only job is to make money, that doesn't bother me at all. That does not mean I can't be disappointed in them taking the route I like less."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Disparanoia,2,Mon May 18 16:14:12 2015 UTC,"I guess for me the difference that makes it acceptable is that I always enjoy base game V and BE far more than any other game series, so even though base games aren't comparable to completed previous editions, I'm still okay with paying full price."

civbeyondearth,36d08z,lolhaibai,1 point,Tue May 19 03:47:30 2015 UTC,"Im excited for a revamped diplomacy, i hope its good.  This game even more than civ 5 had a terrible diplomacy system. At least in civ 5 you can do research agreements and trade luxury resources making you use it often, but in Beyond Earth its used very ocassionaly.  I hope they also add things to do after the mid game. In civ 5 theres always things to do, in Beyond Earth theres nothing to do at the end game, and if you dont have wars going on during mid game, even that is a bit un-eventfull.  I have high hopes for the patch and the expansion, and even if im comparing it so much to civ 5, i would really like for them to departure from civ 5 as much as possible. The new things to BE were really nice, there was just not a lot of them.  EDIT: I see the devs mention that we feel more connected to the civ 5 leaders because they were historical figures and we extrapolate what we know about them to the game, which may be true to an extend.   But i have no clue who ""Boudica"" was, yet i feel more attached to her than any of the BE leaders. I feel this is because of two main reasons:  -The first one is that the Dev team knew who she was and animated her to give her that character, Boudica has an animation that represents her in a very different way than Washington or Montezuma or any other civ. In BE they all look very similar, they dont really have much character at all.  -The second reason is that they have a background adding some atmosphere to the leader screen. Montezuma's screen looks intimidating, while Washington's looks prominent and inviting, etc... BE's leaders do not have this."

civbeyondearth,36d08z,19683dw,-10,Thu May 21 22:08:55 2015 UTC,"Civ:BE finally killed it for me for Sid's Firaxis's games.  I really wanted to like this one.  I realise the patch has fixed some bugs, but the underlying gameplay is flawed at release and still is.    I think a lot of people feel the same, and it's a cheek for them to ask for £20 to fix what is a broken game.  £10 MIGHT have been acceptable, but this is 2/3 the cost of the game at release.  I don't think it represents the value that it adds.  Maybe one day if it appears on a Steam sale in the future I might get it, but I won't be getting this at full price."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Robolenin,1 point,Mon May 18 17:17:11 2015 UTC,GmG with their discounts I think it's safe to say that you could get it close to this.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Chuck_Morris_SE,1 point,Mon May 18 17:52:16 2015 UTC,They'll be doing a lot of fixing via patch regardless of you buying the xpac or not.
civbeyondearth,36d08z,MoXria,-1,Tue May 19 05:52:32 2015 UTC,Now just one more expansion to bring in orbital units and cities and we'll have a full game on our hands!
civbeyondearth,36d08z,Chuck_Morris_SE,-5,Mon May 18 23:36:46 2015 UTC,"If they're the only features then it doesn't really feel like an 'expansion' to me, either way I'll be waiting for a sale to buy anymore Beyond Earth stuff.  Oh no, are we back on the BE hype train guys?, look what happened to that last time."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,MoXria,10,Mon May 18 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"What? New sponsors and a whole extra mechanism (water colonizing), new units, new unit types, improved diplomacy and new biomass types... Honestly what the fuck are you on about? how is this not an expansion?   They literally expand the game in almost every way."
civbeyondearth,36d08z,El_Barto_227,0,Mon May 18 18:40:20 2015 UTC,"Doesn't really seem like much, however I'll reserve judgement depending on the price, if it's £15 then it's a rip off."
civbeyondearth,36eq4z,RxKing,12,Mon May 18 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"I'm so excited to see a frontline marine like ship that can take hits.  I always thought that water based combat was missing something since the basic gunboat felt so squishy.  Really excited to see the new units (hybrids sound awesome), water cities, and a new diplomacy mechanic as well.  Haven't played BE in maybe 3 months now, but I have very high hopes."
civbeyondearth,36eq4z,Jord3nktp15,6,Mon May 18 22:18:31 2015 UTC,"This all sounds like exactly the steps I wanted whenever I discussed this. Great direction, Firaxis.  Only thing thats missing so far is more Terraforming options. I'm still waiting on my ""Build Canal"" option!"
civbeyondearth,36eq4z,Archfiendrai,3,Tue May 19 00:04:09 2015 UTC,"Glad to see that biomes will have an effect on gameplay, I hope they add in volcanic activity for the primordial biome."
civbeyondearth,36eq4z,Manannin,3,Mon May 18 22:59:59 2015 UTC,I've been begging for that for AGES.
civbeyondearth,36eq4z,Archfiendrai,3,Tue May 19 00:01:48 2015 UTC,This video just made me pretty excited. It sounds like they are really taking this game in a good direction. Here's for hoping on a good delivery.
civbeyondearth,36eq4z,BasedGunt,2,Mon May 18 22:37:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't hear the Dynamic Leader Abilities being discussed in the announcement. Understandable, especially given the massive amount of information released at once. But I am curious as to the prerequisites necessary, the scope of the changes, and (as stated in the features) how it interacts with diplomacy."

civbeyondearth,36eq4z,Dredge6,1 point,Thu May 21 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"First two I knew, rest sounds interesting, I'll watch it in a bit.  Thanks!"
civbeyondearth,36dri3,marquis_des_oeufs,30,Mon May 18 16:11:35 2015 UTC,They just said on the live stream that there will be a sizable vanilla patch when the expansion launches. Whatever makes sense to include without the new features will be included.
civbeyondearth,36dri3,Zael,2,Mon May 18 18:21:29 2015 UTC,Makes sense. That's what they did for all the Civ 5 patches.
civbeyondearth,36dri3,Xavs42,-26,Wed May 20 00:02:39 2015 UTC,"What a load of shit.  6-8 months for something that will only be minor parts of a DLC?  Either the 2.0 patch will include most of the DLC, in which case the DLC will be a ripoff, or it won't include most of the improvements, which means promising a 2.0 patch was just bullshit to keep stringing us along until DLC.  I suspect the latter."
civbeyondearth,36dri3,BobbleBobble,15,Mon May 18 19:07:03 2015 UTC,"So either too hot or too cold, eh?  I'd instead bet that the diplomacy, hybrid affinity, and biome changes will come in a patch with sea based gameplay and, perhaps, new sponsors in the expansion."
civbeyondearth,36dri3,Galgus,10,Mon May 18 20:44:00 2015 UTC,"I doubt they'll throw in the biomes, and I'd be surprised if they put in the affinity changes.  The diplomacy is something that's fairly broken, so I'll be surprised if that isn't changed in the patch, but big game mechanic features probably won't be given out for free.  Then again, I don't have any knowledge past what you all do.  So we'll see.  I'm optimistic."
civbeyondearth,36dri3,mabrasm,-1,Mon May 18 21:46:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I'll try to emulate your optimism :)"
civbeyondearth,36dri3,BobbleBobble,3,Mon May 18 20:57:24 2015 UTC,"I'm cautiously optimistic, the update has potential but I'm waiting to see if they realize it."
civbeyondearth,36dri3,Galgus,13,Mon May 18 21:08:57 2015 UTC,"Missed the stream, but caught some of the info from the twitch mods afterward. Patch 2.0 will be delivered to Beyond Earth with the release of Rising Tide, but you will not need to buy Rising Tide to get the tweaks."
civbeyondearth,36dri3,DigitalDeckard,-21,Mon May 18 18:27:06 2015 UTC,"This is extremely disappointing.  They announced 2.0 in early March.  Now we won't get it until ""Fall""?  That's 6-8 months!"
civbeyondearth,36dri3,BobbleBobble,18,Mon May 18 19:04:11 2015 UTC,"They never gave a release date when they announced it, and now we have one."
civbeyondearth,36dri3,TJerky,16,Mon May 18 19:40:02 2015 UTC,"Plus, people said they rushed the initial release, so they listened and take their time now... man, they just can't win, can they?"
civbeyondearth,36dri3,WhatGravitas,13,Mon May 18 22:04:49 2015 UTC,"Development takes time, better they do it right than rush out crap."
civbeyondearth,36dri3,MDRAR,4,Mon May 18 19:57:40 2015 UTC,The fact it's going through a beta this time will be nice.
civbeyondearth,36dri3,Velrei,4,Mon May 18 21:35:56 2015 UTC,Probably the single biggest contributor to the mess they're in now
civbeyondearth,36dri3,MDRAR,6,Mon May 18 22:41:13 2015 UTC,Fall is in 4 months...
civbeyondearth,36dri3,Smoke96x,-9,Mon May 18 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"6-8 months from March, when it was announced (assuming Fall is Sep-Nov)"

civbeyondearth,36dri3,BobbleBobble,1 point,Mon May 18 23:13:06 2015 UTC,I hope they arent. Im not planning on spending any money on an expansion until the game itself receives some care.
civbeyondearth,36dri3,grub_step,2,Mon May 18 16:14:51 2015 UTC,"Same, I am excited for the expansion but I'd also like to see the patch go through before hand."
civbeyondearth,36dri3,DigitalDeckard,1 point,Mon May 18 18:19:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, they specifically said in Feb/Mar that they'd be putting out a significant update in a few months (""2.0"").  The expansion won't be until the Fall.  But tune into the live stream at 2pm EST, I'm sure they'll get asked and answer this question."
civbeyondearth,36dri3,BobbleBobble,-7,Mon May 18 16:27:23 2015 UTC,They're the same thing. I thought that 2.0 was going to be a peace offering dropping maybe a few months before the expansion. Despite the sycophants who crawled out of the woodwork today I think there are a lot of people here who still feel burned by the release of BE.
civbeyondearth,36dri3,Robolenin,1 point,Mon May 18 23:29:09 2015 UTC,they're not. We're still getting the patch.
civbeyondearth,36d2sj,SaltTM,5,Mon May 18 12:37:02 2015 UTC,"I'm excited. I got a lot more playtime out of Beyond Earth than most others, although I recognize its faults. The new aliens and hybrid affinities really excite me."
civbeyondearth,36d2sj,Ian1732,1 point,Mon May 18 15:41:03 2015 UTC,"So does this mean the beyond earth 2.0 revamp isn't going to happen, or is this it?"
civbeyondearth,36d2sj,Popeskii,3,Tue May 19 10:50:23 2015 UTC,"It is and it isn't. 2.0 is being released alongside Rising Tide, and Rising Tide also deals with some of the issues, but 2.0 is definitely still coming as a free patch."
civbeyondearth,36d2sj,El_Barto_227,1 point,Tue May 19 13:42:42 2015 UTC,Yes! I don't even play Civ 5 anymore. This game is my new favorite now that there is an official expansion. Best news to wake up to. This just reinforces my lack of need for friends. :(
civbeyondearth,36ckkw,HatedByGod,2,Mon May 18 08:25:20 2015 UTC,I think the problem you're facing with the ai having a ridiculous number of units is due to how late you're taking a game in quick speed. My quick speed Soyuz difficulty domination games usually end around turn 160-170 for a standard size and  never go over 200 turns for larger maps. By turn 250 I'd imagine the ai doesn't have anything left to build except units. Try making good use of the phasal transporter to get troops in place quickly all over the map. If you can send a small force to a coastal city on another continent to take the city for just 1 turn you can set up the transporter and warp in units from every friendly city.   Workers will always spam terrascape on auto. Most of my tile improvements are finished by turn 220 except for tiles I'm switching to manufacturies so all other workers go to sleep till i need them. Having so many workers is a bit obnoxious.
civbeyondearth,36ckkw,Arcteryx3034,2,Mon May 18 14:41:51 2015 UTC,"But I don't want to finish the game fast. I want to let it go long, and I like large battles. However, I don't know of a more convenient way of dealing with masses of enemies. In Alpha Centauri, I would use fusion nukes to ravage the masses. What can I do in CivBE?  Also, is it possible to use automate workers without spamming terrascapes? I disabled the replace improvements option; but is there some way to have workers not build terrascapes?  Thanks. _^"
civbeyondearth,36ckkw,Jememoilol,1 point,Mon May 18 15:03:33 2015 UTC,"Then that's your decision. The poster above simply stated that after a certain set of turns, the AI has nothing else to build except for troops, so that's what it will do."
civbeyondearth,36ckkw,Galgus,2,Mon May 18 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"That was never in doubt. My question is: how does one deal with the masses of units produced by the AI? In SMAC, I used gravship carriers loaded with planet busters to reduce the world to a watery wasteland. I could take on the giant late-game masses of enemies with relative ease. How would I do something like that in CivBE?"
civbeyondearth,36ckkw,Galgus,1 point,Mon May 18 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"Build your own army and win some martial glory!  Besides, what's the fun in winning with an ""I win"" button like nukes?  And if you want longer games, you should try Marathon on - I don't play anything else."
civbeyondearth,36ckkw,Galgus,2,Tue May 19 05:29:12 2015 UTC,"Nukes aren't an 'I win' button. They are superweapons, sure, but even superweapons require strategy and good execution, not to mention a ton of tech to get them. So many strategy games have balanced superweapons, including SMAC and previous Civ games, and they're a lot of fun to use.  I shall try marathon. It's a bit daunting, due to my general shortage of time in a day, but I will try and play a few marathon games this week, and see how they feel.  What kind of army is recommended for late-game ravaging? I like massing dragoons (purity tier 4 combat rovers) myself, as they move quickly, levitate (and are thus unimpeded by terrain), and can be used to quickly surround and capture cities. However, I wonder if I can exploit the flanking bonuses of the redeemer (tier 4 supremacy combat rover). Any ideas?  Also, what late-game tile setup should I aim for?  Thanks! :D"
civbeyondearth,36ckkw,I_pity_the_fool,2,Tue May 19 08:06:56 2015 UTC,"They are an ""I win"" button in that they simplify wars and make them relatively easy compared to using units - though the AI isn't exactly challenging when they aren't cheating like crazy.  They just seem boring to me in Civ games, though I loved them in Red Alert 3 where they were less practical.    Marathon can only really be played in multiple sittings, often when multitasking something else.  The big downside to it is all the ""next turn"" turns where you are kind of just waiting for something.  The big upside is that units can move far, far more relative to development time: fighting more distant wars is much more feasible.    Personally I love the Purity infantry when built to hold the line, but Dragoons are great for taking cities.  Not sure on late game tile setup for war honestly, other than production to pump out units and science to tech them up."
civbeyondearth,36ckkw,jabontik,1 point,Tue May 19 19:43:28 2015 UTC,"Eh, I see your point, but I disagree. I guess we can just agree to disagree.    Hmm, don't know how long I have to wait for stuff, but let's see. The increased scope for combat sounds promising.    So is purity the way to go? I thought about using Supremacy first, then I found Harmony to be really useful, and I've most recently found Purity to pack a sizable punch. However, I don't know if I'm doing things right.  So far, I have found that:   Unique and super units are not worth it. Infantry are decent early on, but too inefficient by late game. Rocket rovers, combat satellites, and most other long-range artillery are way too easy for the enemy to counter. LEV tanks and destroyers are pretty amazing, but not amazing enough to be worth using a finite resource to get them, as mentioned earler. Combat rovers are terrible early on, but amazing when they get to tier 4. Production > all. It's best to build farms everywhere (except for on improvements), and get all the farm improvements It's a good idea to build roads/mag-rails everywhere and get to supremacy level 3.   Am I correct? What is your take on this?"
civbeyondearth,369uyr,jsfuller13,21,Sun May 17 16:25:31 2015 UTC,"This could be cool. You could have an underwater, above water, and orbital layers, with each being useable. That'd be great!"

civbeyondearth,369uyr,runetrantor,2,Sun May 17 22:13:19 2015 UTC,"I love how it looks, but I can never get fully into it.  It's too much of a production chain manager, rather than a city builder (Hence why I have never considered i part of the city builder genre).  And their system seems to be 100% reliant on islands, they never make large landmasses like civ would."

civbeyondearth,35x4bg,JackChronicler,11,Thu May 14 06:19:23 2015 UTC,The visuals are so dull. They could have done so much more to give us interesting scenery
civbeyondearth,35x4bg,Situis,10,Thu May 14 16:37:58 2015 UTC,"I think the visuals would be fine, if all the visuals we see are like ONE out of like 6-8 biomes on ONE type of world. The whole planet looks the same and each planet looks alike-- it's embarrassing frankly for a game so modern and hotly anticipated."
civbeyondearth,35x4bg,Malcatraz,6,Thu May 14 21:05:46 2015 UTC,Real terrain differences between biomes and multi-biome maps would easily make the planets more diverse.  I made a thread earlier on ways to overhaul the biome system with some ideas for new biomes.
civbeyondearth,35x4bg,Galgus,1 point,Fri May 15 00:25:00 2015 UTC,"Each biome should also come with unique aliens and should scale with alien difficulty and resource availability.   I.e. A dessert has many hostile worms but the resource payoffs are worth the potential damage inflicted.  You'd have to set up parimeter defense and always keep on eye out. This can be applied to volcanos, marshes, whatever."
civbeyondearth,35x4bg,Timbitkiller,3,Fri May 22 12:49:51 2015 UTC,"This is a great assessment of the game, especially your observation about how internal the focus is. I have only played three full games (all on hard difficulty). I won them all, but essentially ignored the other civs, never engaging in any diplomacy and only bothering to attack a few neighboring cities (the AI defense was atrocious). I also engaged purely in internal trade, as the benefits seemed to be far greater than trading with stations or other civs. After my three games I decided to shelve the game for now and revisit after the 2.0 patch."

civbeyondearth,35x4bg,Velrei,5,Thu May 14 06:20:30 2015 UTC,"They do transform outposts into cities at twice the rate too, which is useful."
civbeyondearth,35x4bg,Velrei,3,Thu May 14 07:24:02 2015 UTC,"I think it would be more useful if there was more impetus to expand. Civ: BE has a shorter expansion tolerance radius than 5 did (3 tiles instead of 4 in C5) so empires have the ability to be a little smaller. And from a tactical perspective, smaller is better. Easier to move your troops around, easier to move your workers around, and what have you. On top of there being (natural) reasons to be smaller size-wise, there is no encouragement to be bigger, not even for the Victory conditions, which are what the game leads to. In C5, there were natural wonders that provided huge early and middle game bonuses. There were luxury resources that gave great diplomatic and economic clout. Now, with the rebuild of the health system and no wonders, there isn't a reason to go wide. Maybe a better solution would to be add natural wonders to the game again- great structures of mechanical and biological origin that change the landscape and encourage expansion while lending a little more character to the landscape."
civbeyondearth,35x4bg,Mamuto,5,Sat May 16 04:28:40 2015 UTC,"I would argue differently: The entire community I've seen has complained there is too much motive to go wide over tall, particularly on this subreddit and /r/civ.   There isn't a tree like Tradition encouraging tall, the strategic resources alone give you plenty of reason to expand.   As far as victory conditions: Harmony actively encourages more cities as places to make more mind stems, having more with purity gives you more potential cities to act as a buffer zone to protect your colonists (and more places to put them, between those cities). Supremacy would let you protect your gate better and build better single units (Angels, presumably) to send through rapidly (using that extra firaxite you got from expanding).  Personally, I think natural wonders would be neat, but I don't see much of a point to luxuries in a game set in the far future. If they make them work well I won't complain, but I don't mind them setting the game apart from Civ more by not having them."
civbeyondearth,35x4bg,Malcatraz,2,Sat May 16 08:19:50 2015 UTC,So half a year later and the same problems persist? It's a shame to hear that..   Have they released the SDK for BE? Haven't really been following firaxis recently.

civbeyondearth,35cw01,throwmeaway99870,18,Sat May 9 02:23:15 2015 UTC,I imagine it's playtesting for Beyond Earth 2.0  http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/12/8198201/civilization-beyond-earth-patch-creators-fixing-mistakes-gdc-2015
civbeyondearth,35cw01,Robolenin,19,Sat May 9 03:27:27 2015 UTC,"I really hope 2.0 is like... an official overhaul mod, rather than a lot of tweaks to the balance.  They mention how we didnt connect to the leaders... Honestly, I think a great way to do that would have been to let their voice actors read their tech quotes, who they are quoted from, rather than have the cheerful girl. (That also probably detracts depth to them. The Alpha Centauri quotes were great, but I am willing to bet that if they had been read by that woman, they would have felt much more shallow).  All those quotes gave us much more chance to see how each leader was beyond the diplo screen where they only speak of the matter at hand. It's from those quotes that we see that Kozlov is a 'no bullshit' man, that Elodie is a snarky and sassy woman, and that Daoming is too, and also extremely smart, but not mean and 'evil' as yang was.  For a reason the AC leaders had weight to them, even though their diplo text was not voiced, only the quotes. That's all the insight we had into them, and it was good enough to know who was what.  I know it is unlikely, but I would seriously wish they would get the voice actors to return and record their quotes, leaving the cheerful girl for the non leader specific ones.

But my starting setup, regardless of sponsor, is usually: Artists, Continental surveyor, and Laboratory or Weapon arsenal.  Artists are more or less there because I tend to forget about culture a lot so I needed that boost.  Continental surveyor tells me in what directions I can expand and who to gear up for war against if necessary.  I'll get laboratory if I want to win a more peaceful victory, or Weapon arsenal if I know I'm going domination (or just want that extra early boost against aliens).  I'm not the best Civ player and I haven't played as much Beyond Earth as I would like, so any tips on my start would be appreciated!"
civbeyondearth,356vug,Infinite_Nope,5,Thu May 7 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"Continental Surveyor certainly seems very good, particularly on Archipelago maps. An early soldier doesn't seem to do much in my opinion, though. They don't take long to produce, are awful against aliens until you get an upgrade or two, and I find that starts tend to be far enough apart that rushing an opponent is really hard to do. You might want to try starting with a worker for upgrading your capital faster. Laboratory also seems pretty good. Artists seem to be the best specialist by a fair margin, with Scientists coming in a distant second."
civbeyondearth,356vug,Infinite_Nope,1 point,Thu May 7 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"It seems like they need to do some additional balancing with the Artists, huh?  Thanks for the tip on soldiers as well.

I could be very wrong, it's something I need to experiment with more."

I also really like having extra expeditions on my Explorers, and you need the free worker to get that virtue.  I agree about the early unhealth, I get the Clinic more for the Science it provides, but you're right, early growth is basically the same thing. And I do really like those Purity farms...

civbeyondearth,356vug,Baron_Lipton,1 point,Sat May 9 01:02:48 2015 UTC,"I do something similar to what you do, but slightly different, I think I will do some combination on my multi-player game on Saturday. Note that I have Starships for the additional starting options.  Recently I have been going: People's African Union, Artist, Supply Module, Pioneering  PAU: growth and culture, for the same reasons as you. Changes had it replace my choice of Franco/Barre in previous patches  Artist: culture, always picked  Supply Module: A new one from Starships unlock I've been playing with recently. it gives you 2 resource pods next to your city at game start. Helps with the pods quest, and you can get lucky with a culture and/or sci boost.  it is slightly buggy in that sometimes you will lose one of them to the ocean, and not always reliable, but I like it. If you dont have Starships/before I bought it, I would usually use Retrograde Thrusters because I like the map reveal of artifacts/pods/landscape + having the 'perfect' starting spot.  I do see the benefit of Techtonic Scanner and have used it a bit, however I feel that I will settle most of the tiles in my area anyways, and usually base cities on getting my affinity's resource  Pioneering: In the past I almost always took the free worker, but with the large amount of culture already inherent in the build, I dont feel the '1 free virtue' option thats unlocked in Starships is worth it, and the free worker already comes pretty quickly. I tried the clinic and +1 population ones a few times too. recently I have just been doing pioneering though, to unlock the quest for our quick settler from virtues more quickly/in time for our fast culture + to allow me freedom to tech more useful/other things at the start.  While im not completely sure about my last 2 choices(dont think ive even completed an entire game since the recent patch), I will probably stick to them. In the past I usually just build trade depot first for production/clinic/other buildings, maybe fitting in or buying some explorers in there, then making a settler when my city wont grow anytime soon (size 5/6ish). I really like your explorer -> explorer -> settler idea, and will definitely try it out next game. I find I sometimes have trouble finding/securing my city spots in time for the free settler (let alone a 3rd city), and really like to establish territory and expand asap, this should solve it quite nicely... the small trade off at the start definitely would pay off very quickly."
civbeyondearth,356vug,Baron_Lipton,1 point,Fri May 8 15:49:16 2015 UTC,"I don't have Starships, as the best thing I've heard about it is that it unlocks starting options for Civ:BE, so yeah...  Pioneering definitely seems like a solid potential starting bonus, and I've considered it a lot. I guess what it comes down to for me is that I'm building a couple of explorers first anyways, so I don't need to start with Pioneering as I can't really take advantage of it. Trade Depots don't do much until you have a second/third city up, and having 2-3 Explorers early allows you to get a lot of Resource Pods, Alien Skeletons, Ancient Ruins, and scouting.  Supply module seems awesome, though. Two resource pods at the start? Hell yeah!"

I was actually basing that off the fact that the Brasilian leader speaks Spanish, rather than Brazil's Portuguese, and the fact that his intro can be translated ""the united people of South America welcome you"".  As for the PAC that makes sense, lots of difference in those nations.  I believe Franco-Iberia does control Italy as well as North Africa according to the lore, as it was enough land to make people joke that ""Rome had returned"".

I imagine the scenario is that during the Great Mistake, a lot of people was displaced, and Reginaldo does go to mention in his speech that it was them that hold things from falling apart with their army, so it comes to reason that maybe Brazil had a massive influx of people from the rest of the continent going to live there, with the big guy, the most likely to be able to protect and care for them. This could have been so big of a wave that Brazil ended up with a dual language system.  That, or he is like Sussane, who speaks spanish too, along with english, despite no indication that the USA merged with Mexico existing, maybe he is just from spanish speaking parents (At least one), as Sussane had a mexican parent."
civbeyondearth,354itp,runetrantor,2,Mon May 11 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"Good point. But why would Brazil be doing so well with the rest of SA going to hell? I feel if anything it would be Argentina or Chile or something.  also, I feel like Sussane may just be a continuation of the increasing amount of Hispanics within the United States. the population of Mexican immigrants gets higher every year, and as someone living in the Southwest the sheer number of Hispanics means that sooner or later there would be some sort of Hispanic leadership, and I already see that starting to happen."
civbeyondearth,354itp,Zencrusibel,2,Mon May 11 05:31:05 2015 UTC,"We dont have to have gone to hell, the other SA countries are probably banding together in a couple of Franco Iberia like unions, it's just that Brasilia is the military powerhouse, many will go there to be safer, similar to how many flock to Europe or USA, which does not have to mean their home country is in ruins, it's just.. better.  And remember the world at that moment is balancing on a knife, things stabilized after the mistake and began to 'improve' in a shaky way, but things could easily devolve into war for water and resources, so you would likely want to be under the dude with the guns.  I see the rest of SA joining in two factions, north is Gran Colombia 2.0, and in the south a joint nation of chile, argentina, and uruguay.  Each of these factions has decent amount of lands and resources under them, and they dont have to be enemies with Brasilia, just separate states.  Yes, I did read some stuff about how in some states they will no longer be minorities for much longer. (I kind of laugh when I see someone freak out over it. Like... You had a decades long propaganda campaign where you depicted yourself as the best country in the world, where dreams come true. Shocker, that people now want in! XD) It's interesting to see the counties where this is happening, if seen from above in a map, kind of outline the old borders of Mexico before their war with the USA for Texas.  But yes, a hispanic leader is eventually going to pop up, although Sussane is not a politician someone elected, she rose ranks inside the megacorp. (I kind of expect USA to be a faction latter on, ARC felt like it had a lot of power in there, but was not running it directly)."

I assume Paraguay goes with Argentine, under the tenuous premise of then having the 'guay' at the end like Uruguay, so they may have something in common?  Peru and Bolivia... I think I would make them join Gran Colombia, Brasilia is large enough already, and Brazil IS the oddball of the continent, speaking portuguese and not even having spanish as a second language. So having them with Brasilia is complicated.  I while ago I made a map of how I would organize the world, after something like the Big Mistake, South America is somewhat how I envision the BE factions (The Paraguay, Bolivia, and Peru issue was still hanging as you can see). Dismiss the rest of the world, this is set 2000 years into the future, over half of that the world was as dead as the moon, so the new nation borders dont fit with culture groups, because all of them died.

Maybe Finland too.  You could justify its history reasonably well too:   As international relations became strained during the mid 21st century, Britain and the Nordic nations felt threatened by the rising power of Franco Iberia and the Slavic Federation. leading to both nations seeking unity and closer relations.

So as resources become more scarce and precious, tensions between countries rise. Lesser nations turn to powerful neighbours for protection or are swallowed up, and Nations begin merging into fractured power blocs. Uniting to late to preserve the earth but combining resources to escape it.   The Nordic Countries have a lot of natural resources but lack the population to defend themselves if threatened by a powerful neighbour, and Russia/Slavic Federation is right next door.   I think the great mistake was that the world pursued economic growth at the expense of unity and the environment. Not just global warming, but Smog (There are cities in China where children have never seen blue skys, only smog) and the health effects of that, Massive death of sea life, over farming.

You could set up a deal in multiplayer and then modify it after the other player had accepted, allowing you to take everything they had.

If you are paying attention, you should be able to see your intrigue levels increase, if it's rising then put an agent there. Building Surveillance Web in your major cities stops all major operations in those cities by reducing not even allowing intrigue to rise high enough."
civbeyondearth,34hibc,randomguy000039,4,Fri May 1 14:57:39 2015 UTC,"Stationing an agent in a city with high intrigue will bring it back down.  So when your city gets to 3 or 4 intrigue station one of your agents in it, and it will bring it back down out of coup range."

It seems like it does because usually when I start a high level operation and the level gets lowered it often fails, but I don't know for sure."
civbeyondearth,34hibc,djdanlib,3,Fri May 1 16:35:49 2015 UTC,"So you're saying that the intrigue level at the beginning of the operation is the determining factor, not the level at subsequent turns prior to completion??"

civbeyondearth,34hibc,djdanlib,2,Sat May 2 03:46:15 2015 UTC,That seems counter-intuitive to the point of stationing an agent in a city to lower its intrigue level. Hmm...
civbeyondearth,34hibc,Neebat,4,Sat May 2 04:07:05 2015 UTC,"You're supposed to station an agent there when the intrigue starts going up.  If you wait until it gets high, it's too late."

civbeyondearth,34g18y,navarin,3,Fri May 1 20:50:07 2015 UTC,"Not the guy you were responding to, but EL combat is frustrating when you don't have initiative because the changing battlefield makes your orders out of date at best.

civbeyondearth,34g18y,LostThyme,2,Fri May 1 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"I've noticed the BE steam workshop has a tag filter that says 'Version_2' which leads me to believe the changes will be significant enough for them to draw a line between the old ways and the new. Maybe they should renumber them an make version two, version one and anything before that negative numbers counting backwards. BE: BC followed by BE: AD? Reading forums and reviews, many seem to want to crucify the developers so it would be fitting."
civbeyondearth,34g18y,Robolenin,4,Sat May 2 17:29:10 2015 UTC,According Polygon in March 'the next few months'  http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/12/8198201/civilization-beyond-earth-patch-creators-fixing-mistakes-gdc-2015   Browsed the Firaxis forums but they don't seem to think there is any official news.

civbeyondearth,34g18y,runetrantor,6,Fri May 1 05:46:32 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for the latter but expecting the former.
civbeyondearth,34g18y,Russeru,5,Fri May 1 08:18:46 2015 UTC,"Same, it is REALLY uncommon for devs to not only acknowledge that their game was not good enough, but to go and rip pieces out to rebuild, rather than polish intensively.  I really hope it's the latter, specially because we are not getting another scifi civ for a long time surely. If this was the standard type of extra game per Civ generation, I could just sit and go 'oh well, Civ 6's version will be better' but that's unlikely, so it's either now, or not in a long time, see how long it took them to try and do a game in Alpha Centauri's style, even when everyone was saying AC was great and deserved a new game. D:"
civbeyondearth,34g18y,Galgus,3,Fri May 1 08:52:55 2015 UTC,"They've been pretty open about how underwhelming the story/characters came out, so I'm hoping they're pretty open to making substantial changes at least on the level of the Civ 5 expansions."
civbeyondearth,34g18y,runetrantor,7,Fri May 1 14:51:05 2015 UTC,"The big thematic selling point for me in BE was the Affinities.  They added an interesting asymmetry and some ideological questions without breaking the game's optimistic feeling.  In game, though, Affinities barely seem to effect anything other than nudging players down build paths that really aren't so different.  Revamping mechanics like Aliens and Affinities could really bring their thematic impact to its full potential, in my opinion.  That and more background available for Stations in game - as a side note."
civbeyondearth,34g18y,Galgus,3,Sat May 2 10:22:06 2015 UTC,"I really hope so indeed. Fix it and they can add to it with dlcs we would buy.  But right now? I would be very unsure about buying the fix, if it was paid."
civbeyondearth,34g18y,runetrantor,2,Fri May 1 18:25:33 2015 UTC,"If the fix was half of what I've dreamed of for the game, I'd buy it.  Though BE's release hurt my trust in their development, so I'd be skeptical.  Hoping the 2.0 patch gets me to say ""Those guys can really make a game!"" rather than ""This could have been great."""
civbeyondearth,34g18y,navarin,6,Sat May 2 10:24:22 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of hope, but it's been slowly dying.  Starships killed a lot of it. Yes, it was a 'different team' but to me, the fact they just go and announce another game and dont even seem to address the issues of the last one just feels like a disconnect, a 'we dont care that much'.  A lot of devs stick to the game post launch to fix all stuff, are open and mention what they want to change, not announce a new one with only vague 'we are not leaving it yet' statements.  Honestly? Firaxis is now off my 'trust to pre order' list of companies, which is now listing only Paradox, Nintendo, and some indies. :S"
civbeyondearth,34g18y,Galgus,6,Sat May 2 18:47:25 2015 UTC,"I don't care that they moved onto Starships. I care that Starships was an awful mobile game that doesn't at all fit with what I envision when I think of a Firaxis game. I didn't mind XCOM on consoles (though I play it on PC) because it was fundamentally an awesome game. Starships, on the other hand, felt like a $15 cash grab trying to springboard off integration with an already mediocre Beyond Earth.  The reason this worries me is it feels like Firaxis is losing what made me like them in the first place. Their recent games have been a consistent progression toward simplifying and streamlining to the point of making games very shallow. I don't think they're necessarily wrong for producing the games they want to produce, but the style change does make me sad."
civbeyondearth,34g18y,runetrantor,6,Sat May 2 19:39:48 2015 UTC,"Starships didn't make me less hopeful because it was done instead of patching up BE - the different teams thing seems reasonable.  It made me less hopeful because it looks like a simple, casual tablet game.  That doesn't exactly inspire confidence that they have some brilliant ideas in the wings coming in the 2.0 patch.  Even a Sid Meier's Pirates! in space with some moderate additions would have been more interesting.    I feel the same way with Firaxis, I lost a lot of trust in them with BE.  I continue to hold that the game has amazing potential, but they really wasted most of it.  I still remember how, pre-release, Aliens were played off as being extremely dangerous and Frenzied Aliens was advertised as a losing scenario.  In the actual game, they are a speedbump at most that barely reacts to aggression - Barbarians have given me more inconveniences.  Beyond Earth is full of things like that - unrealized what-could-have-beens.    Out of curiosity, what made you trust Paradox less?  I know them mostly for Magicka, which I liked."
civbeyondearth,34g18y,Robolenin,3,Sat May 2 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"The different team thing looks reasonable, yes. But the BE team is then mute and AWOL, I mean, I dont expect them to release a patch weekly or anything nuts, but just a 'hey guys, we are still doing stuff!' for a good while I thought they had left BE to rot.  Yes, the aliens, so much 'they are not barbs!'/'testers died because they treated them like barbs!'. At best you are a bit careful early on, then you just stomp them. The one time I allied them, they were ten time more of a hassle than when I killed them all. All my nation, outside the ultrasound fences, was full of them so I could not move around.  You misunderstoof, Paradox is still in the list of 'trust', they are one of the few. I now have EU4, and Skylines, made by their pseudo protectorate.  So far they seem nice, lets see how long that lasts, I have had many companies leave the list after I trusted them completely."
civbeyondearth,34g18y,Andy06r,5,Sat May 2 22:26:56 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda optimistic about this actually. The article talks about these guys wanting to fix diplomacy, the delivery of lore, and improve the wonder awe factor among other things. They're also billing it as Beyond Earth 2.0 which is quite telling. I don't think they'd risk burning the community by hyping it up like that if they didn't plan to make some radical changes."
civbeyondearth,34g18y,Galgus,4,Fri May 1 12:05:31 2015 UTC,"Says polygon, the same rag that hyped Beyond Earth 1.0."
civbeyondearth,34g18y,Andy06r,2,Fri May 1 20:52:42 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought of it, but an official overhaul mod would be a great way to do it.  I really want them to be more daring with the game and be willing to make drastic changes, but that way it could stay the same for anyone that doesn't like it.  The game could use some huge expansion on the relevance and interest in some mechanics, and the addition of more.    On more simple terms, I feel like many Virtues feel really weak with some good and some great ones; and I'd like to see more interesting paths and impact in it.  In particular Applied Metasocialogy is boring and impotent while the virtue it replaced, Applied Aesthetics, was fun, interesting, and an enabler for culture-heavy play.  Generally I'd like asymmetrical strengths to be more prominent and pronounced, like Prosperity being amazing for expansion while Knowledge is amazing for cultural and scientific play."

civbeyondearth,34hcgs,ParagonRenegade,5,Thu May 7 16:16:52 2015 UTC,"Purity has the strongest direct combat units, so they're suited to overwhelming their enemies in open confrontation. Be very aggressive.  Harmony has area denial and economy-boosting strategies out the wazoo. Spread miasma like crazy and abuse your affinity-specific satellites (Rocktopus, solar collector). Use this to outlast your enemy by sapping his strength before a counter attack.  Supremacy is all about finesse and planning. Set up your SABR's, deploy teleporters on firaxite deployment areas, and use the ANGEL to attack vulnerable positions."

civbeyondearth,34hcgs,burrowowl,1 point,Fri May 1 16:45:12 2015 UTC,"Militarily speaking Harmony can make it very, very difficult to invade their space. Lone wolf brawlers/marauders in miasma are hard to dislodge, extended range jets, lone wolf vipers into hit and run marauders. Miasma, the drone sphere, etc. etc. There are lots of little things that add up to make it a total pain to slog through a harmony nation.  Purity: I am sure there is a strategy other than spamming tanks. I've never needed it, though. Get the +10% per unused, get the +50% to cities. Lev tanks and lev destroyers are super powerful. But why do all that when you can just spam dragoons forever?  Supremacy: I never play those genocidal metal freaks."

I personally prefer Machinery to Hydroponics. Early farms will be better for your population than starting with +1.  ""which is better of the 2 for the first Combat Rover upgrade, flanking or fortified unit damage""  The way I play (and with a Contact Victory) neither of these will be particularly awesome. Probably flanking since you have to pick something..."
civbeyondearth,346mh9,Ridry,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:49:49 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you said except I prefer the soldier over the worker since having an extra unit for early recon/defense is for me a necessity especially with all the aliens and goodie huts.  Also flanking is a great option in this scenario since it stacks with all the flanking bonuses you get from supremacy anyway.
civbeyondearth,346mh9,fritzvonamerika,3,Wed Apr 29 07:34:31 2015 UTC,"The last Supremacy Upgrade for the Combat Rover is useless:  it already has the ""all terrain costs over movement"" and that includes zone of control, apparently.  I don't believe they've patched that redundancy out yet."

Now before you get upset, let me clarify that you are not theoretically wrong, you are fundamentally wrong.  What's the different it sounds like you're calling me an idiot ether way?   Theoretically you are absolutely right. Your choices for starting bonuses are well thought out and unique to how you play.  Fundamentally you are wrong in saying you are going to play 1 way as supremacy, and only get this specific virtues. You probably even know what specific technologies you are going to get.   This is wrong, and here's why.  What virtues and affinity you go depend completely on your environment. If you land in xenomass heaven, with not a single firaxite nearby, there's no way you go supremacy over harmony. And if those xenomass all have nests on them and are spawning aliens nonstop, better b-line your virtue in might that gives you science for killing those fuckers. Fuck knowledge...I'll show you how much I know by marching my god damn boots over every alien I find. Who needs to found outposts when you can taken capitals on turn 70? The only time you need to start worrying about negative health is when you start loosing culture and science for it....somewhere around -15.  What makes this game better then Civ5 (imo) is the fact you can play them same game with the same person so many times, and have so many different experiences. What this also means is that you can't go into a game saying ""I'm going to do this, this, and this"" That would be like playing Civ5 and saying you are going to get the pantheon of Dessert Folklore and your starting location is a jungle.  Don't get me wrong here, it's your game so play it the way that makes you have fun. But if you're trying to take the game a little more serious...go into each match with an open mind."

Yeah, I tend to realize(select?) what I like in a game before playing it; if I land near a lot of xenomass, maybe I'll just take advantage of this being a video game and restart?    To me, Beyond Earth is a way to construct an approximate preferred/ideal civilization using some given data. An expression of self/aspirations. (a lot of games might be like that to me?)"

civbeyondearth,344e9x,Dredge6,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"same issue only using a melee unit does not work. I am trading with the station I want to destroy, which I assume is the reason why I cant attack it. need to build a city there to get the vital resources I need for my mega death walker.  how the hell do I end trade so I can kill the station? I really need it gone, trade routes dont seem to expire or be changeable in any way, ive been trading since nearly the start of the game with them. I am so irate right now over this its ridiculous."
civbeyondearth,33xcbe,CrimsonKinga,2,Sun Apr 26 15:22:21 2015 UTC,Are you asking for the artwork in the game or artwork to mod into the game?
civbeyondearth,33xcbe,Drake55645,2,Sun Apr 26 17:18:44 2015 UTC,I'm looking for the artowrk that we can see in the default game.
civbeyondearth,33w7mv,PublicPool,10,Sun Apr 26 05:31:30 2015 UTC,"They attack things near nests, and they will make attacks of opportunity on units they outmatch significantly.  They don't really retaliate much to killing a single random alien.  They will attack units nearby at yellow and red aggression levels - which are global and determine their interactions with all factions.  Trouble is, they take forever to go to that level of aggression in the normal game."
civbeyondearth,33w7mv,Galgus,2,Sun Apr 26 10:05:58 2015 UTC,"I should have been more specific. Take for example the sea creatures; if my explorer, or ships get near them, they usually will attack (at least once before I move them) me in passing. Yet, in my own waters by my cities, the South American ship comes by and takes 3 turns to kill one, without it defending itself at all! I was really asking and illustrating that the game treats the NPC players differently that it does me."
civbeyondearth,33w7mv,Drake55645,4,Sun Apr 26 13:35:50 2015 UTC,"Was it a sea dragon or a Kraken?  Because Krakens can't go into coastal tiles, which might be the problem.  Personally, I've found that Sea Dragons are much more likely to attack an explorer than a cruiser that's actively shooting at them.  I think they just go with what the computer knows they can do more damage to and survive."
civbeyondearth,33w7mv,Conc1ave,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:52:58 2015 UTC,"its also possible you had a Fence building in that city, so the alien couldnt enter the tile where the npc ship was?"

Water Refinery doesn't have a quest, iirc.

It helps to rush to +7 Health in the Growth policy tree, too."

I generally end up with a ton of workers, because magrails take a while to build, and it's really hard to have too many workers. That means I don't need much reduced in terms of worker speed.

civbeyondearth,33q0s5,monkwren,1 point,Sun Apr 26 13:44:12 2015 UTC,"Well, thanks. The reason I would go for the free maintenance for the Water Refinery is honestly just the flavor (free maintenance is directing excess purified water to the citizens; food is using it for crops)."
civbeyondearth,33m0b0,ThePizar,31,Thu Apr 23 16:43:07 2015 UTC,I asked about this when the game came out.  Answers came in two forms:    Completely surround the station with your armies in an iron wall so the AIs can't get to it.  Who cares? Stations aren't worth it.   I miss minor civilizations that could defend themselves.
civbeyondearth,33m0b0,Neebat,14,Thu Apr 23 17:08:05 2015 UTC,"Surrounding them takes away from one's main force Stations are very valuable, especially early game. +3 science or culture early game? Thank you very much. Even late game added production and gold can be helpful in dire situations."
civbeyondearth,33m0b0,Neebat,16,Thu Apr 23 17:12:50 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, I thought those were terrible answers when I got them.  I wanted stations to be non-broken so I could actually rely on them."
civbeyondearth,33m0b0,monkwren,3,Thu Apr 23 17:16:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one of the things I dislike about this game compared to Civ5 is how weak the stations are compared to city-states. They just feel like non-entities, and while bonus science and culture are nice, internal trade routes are still strong enough that the bonuses are far from necessary."
civbeyondearth,33m0b0,Galgus,3,Thu Apr 23 18:12:34 2015 UTC,"They could at least have their own small military, with protection diplomacy."
civbeyondearth,33m0b0,Yulong,3,Thu Apr 23 19:18:14 2015 UTC,"You don't need to surround stations to make them essentially impervious to the AI. As long asyou're not at war with the aggressor sponsor, place crappy units like explorers, workers or marines at key attacking points around the station (e.g, tiles without miasma), and watch the AI shit itself trying to attack into what is essentially now a station surrounded by 3 mountains and miasma everywhere that its not. I found 2 - 3 of any unit type is more than enough to dissaude a few tacjets and melee units from finishing a station."
civbeyondearth,33m0b0,ZenBS,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:26:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen late game AI take out a station when I left one hex open.

civbeyondearth,33m0b0,TheRealMelvinGibson,2,Sun Apr 26 21:19:15 2015 UTC,Me too. I miss being able to gift units to an ally city nation that's in a good spot to defend me from an enemy or help me take over another civ.
civbeyondearth,33m0b0,peace-monger,10,Sun Apr 26 21:52:23 2015 UTC,"It would be cool if you could pledge to protect a station, and ally with it, but to do so you have to keep a unit fortified within the station. Thus anyone who attacks the station also has to be willing to attack you. Maybe becoming allies with a station would cause that station to trade exclusively with you."
civbeyondearth,33m0b0,Weenoman123,4,Thu Apr 23 19:49:19 2015 UTC,"Here's a small tip: you only need one military unit near the station to disuade the ai from attacking. The AI uses the same approach to stations as it does barb camps in Civ5, it won't soften them up just to let another player swoop in to steal the goodies. They just sit there and wait for you to move, and sometimes give up entirely."
civbeyondearth,33m0b0,housen00b,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:39:47 2015 UTC,"I've seen this not to be the case.  I'll have a station completely surrounded with infantry units and multiple AI's will have ranged units pounding the station every single turn.  I could just waltz in with one of my troops posted next to the station but of course I'm trading with it and its an upgraded high level station so I'm protecting it, but they keep hitting it with ranged keeping it at 0 HP every turn"
civbeyondearth,33m0b0,ZenBS,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:33:23 2015 UTC,I'd feel better about the situation if I could at least attempt to threaten/bargain the AI into cutting it out. It's gotten to the point that I'll go to war late game just to get the ISS nimrods to leave my peeps alone.  edit:word

civbeyondearth,33j0wz,dotmadhack,8,Wed Apr 22 22:32:46 2015 UTC,"Tacnet hub and phasal transporters are super awesome at everything. Since you get orbital lasers with the transporter tech anyway I like to use those for defending my own lands. Planet carver would probably be really awesome in a close battle/war to tip the scales, if it didn't require you research a tech which is useless if you aren't going contact victory. Same thing with the Rocktopus, it's in a weird place on the web and I'd rather just pick up artificial evolution for xenotitans and grab a few other perks in the process."
civbeyondearth,33j0wz,bmhadoken,10,Thu Apr 23 06:26:31 2015 UTC,The satellite layer really doesn't provide much strategic decisionmaking. needs more options and tradeoffs.

If they were only a 1 orbital hex, but could fire at range they'd have much more use.  They still aren't great, as one orbital strike knocks them out, but at least they could be used as a one turn offense boost if they could be put up into orbit like that."
civbeyondearth,33j0wz,Caleth,3,Sun Apr 26 02:19:37 2015 UTC,What about the planet carver?
civbeyondearth,33j0wz,antonius_block,3,Thu Apr 23 00:52:09 2015 UTC,"Never tried to use a Rocktopus.  I've found that the orbital kill beam satellites tend to be much more useful on the defense.  However, in my very first game I put a Planet Carver to excellent use against Africa, because as it turns out it can one-shot late game units.  The Orbital Laser also packs a pretty hefty punch against cities, but it's death incarnate if you want to close off a narrow passage or something."
civbeyondearth,33j0wz,Drake55645,2,Thu Apr 23 02:16:24 2015 UTC,"I've had great luck with orbital satellites on defense in no man's land type areas. Don't have to worry about city strikes there, and artillery have such a small range for satellite strikes that they don't usually get close enough. Basically, I feel like they're insurance against enemy sneak attacks through wastelands that aren't worth settling."
civbeyondearth,33j0wz,gorbachev,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:43:58 2015 UTC,mostly same experience as /u/drake55645  DMG causing sats are great on defense. only time I can use them on offense seems like I already had a huge advantage and didn't need them anyway. If I want to hold an area they're are great.  Also Phasals are redic if used right.

civbeyondearth,33j0wz,Ian1732,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:08:23 2015 UTC,"The nerf is exacerbated by the fact that Planet Carver and Orbital Laser use up Petroleum that, in my experience, is put to much better use on Phasal Transporters. Rocktopus is a bit more usable with the Supremacy Buff but it still lags so far behind the other speedy late game units."
civbeyondearth,33j0wz,ZenBS,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:28:17 2015 UTC,The planet carver can be incredibly useful when paired with the supremacy affinity ability to place any satellite near Firaxite. Also Phasal Teleporter is incredibly powerful when paired with that affinity bonus.   Most of your satellites should be economically focused but picking up some of the late game sats I mentioned above can give you some real BOOM SNEAK ATTACK power that can sometimes be impossible to counter.
civbeyondearth,33dgqm,19683dw,8,Tue Apr 21 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"1: At first just look at the cheapest techs available and get the ones that help you right now. Start with Pioneering (it gives trade depots and colonists), then choose from the first ring of branch techs. Ignore the outer rings and leaf techs until you have an affinity, then let your affinity guide your decisions.  2: Old Earth Relics are high priority because they greatly speed up unlocking virtues. Clinics are good but not something you need right away because dipping into negative health doesn't carry many penalties. Trade Depots are really fantastic if you have a city or station you can trade with, but if your first city is isolated you only get some production out of it. For all other cities, these should be built right away because trade routes are just so good.  3: Prosperity gives you some free units early on and big health bonuses later. I like to get a few virtues from it first and then come back to it in the mid game. Industry has great bonuses to production and especially energy (always get the investment virtue!)  5: You'll want to stick to one affinity. Your military units only upgrade when your primary affinity goes up, and all but one of the victory conditions requires you to hit level 13 in some affinity. Why spend time getting extra levels in other affinities if it won't help you win?"
civbeyondearth,33dgqm,TJerky,5,Tue Apr 21 18:29:26 2015 UTC,you don't have to be strict about the affinity though. if you want a tech that happens to give affinity points to something else then by all means get it.
civbeyondearth,33dgqm,20rakah,2,Wed Apr 22 01:37:51 2015 UTC,I'd also add that what would normally be an Affinity level 12 (I think) upgrade can be achievable with a 10/4 combo.   Say you have level 10 in Harmony and level 4 in Supremacy. This will give you earlier access to upgrade something say like the Xeno Swarm or Xeno Cavalry. These earlier upgrades give you different options for the specific perk you can give them.
civbeyondearth,33dgqm,iborobotosis23,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:33:08 2015 UTC,"Each of the affinity-linked military units you unlock (except the ultimate ones, I'll grant) has an upgrade for each affinity path. So you are totally allowed to dabble.  Civ: Beyond Earth allows for some more roleplaying than other Civ games, so going straight for one Affinity is not absurdly necessary. Though with the lack of economic or diplomatic victories, the options are a bit fewer."
civbeyondearth,33dgqm,leXie_Concussion,3,Wed Apr 22 16:27:11 2015 UTC,"Which wonders are worth going for and are achievable?  personally I like going for Promethian so I can spam manufacturies in a city to make a production powerhouse.   I'll even start with the manufacturies early, sacrificing health for a while to ensure I can build it before an AI does.  I also like Master Control and spamming workers early"
civbeyondearth,33dgqm,housen00b,2,Wed Apr 22 01:14:44 2015 UTC,Trade depots are important because you can set up production trades with (to) your capital for every other city you have.
civbeyondearth,33dgqm,20rakah,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:40:49 2015 UTC,"You can approach the tech in 1 of 2 ways. What your cities need or what your affinity needs. Remember that the only way your units get stronger is your affinity level, so if you're going for domination victory you may just b-line for science and money buildings and your affinity levels/units. Otherwise it comes down to the basic and strategic resources you have what will improve your cities the most. Old Earth Relic is priority 1 building for me, followed by Laboratory. The Lab is your library. Clinics are good sure, but early game health is not important, science is. Really the trees are a free for all. Each tree has early game perks and each has late game perks. #1 thing I recommend no mater what you do, do not underestimate Might. If you are getting swamped by early game aliens, then maybe you should think about picking up the talent that gives science for killing aliens. Finding a lot of expeditions? Get the Knowledge talent that gives science for completing those. You just play it by ear, but make sure you keep in mind what makes the talents so good. Because of the synergy bonuses for going wide, it's not a bad idea to often skip going deeper in a tree for another trees skill that's more useful. If you ask me, might is the most powerful tree. You should be building units when you have excess income and no other useful buildings to make. +35 energy per turn? Don't build a thorium reactor, build Armors. Depends on your environment. Tons of Xenomass? Yes b-line Harmony 4. Tons of Xenomass, but  a decent amount of firaxite? Might want to get some Supremacy for those science builds. Here's 1 thing to remember though. Your unique units get upgraded faster if your are diversified because it might need 10 Harmony and 4 Purity instead of 12 Harmony. Hands Down Chemistry and Engineering. Everything else is play by ear. If they want to give you favor...never. Favor is fucking garbage. Open Borders is whatever you feel like. Depends on your affinity and talents. Purity Loves it's Farms, Prosperity loves it's terrascapes, Harmony loves it's biowells, Knowledge loves its academies, and purity loves  generators. But it all varies. Do you need more science, more energy, or more culture? Play by ear...it's varies greatly. Same as above Any maps without oceans are good for starting."
civbeyondearth,33dgqm,Dredge6,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:19:12 2015 UTC,I'd argue 11.  If you go with an Archipelago map and build a lot of gunboats early on you can target seige worms and other land aliens with ease. Plus trade vessels I find tend to have more options for routes than convoys.
civbeyondearth,33dgqm,iborobotosis23,2,Wed Apr 22 17:45:57 2015 UTC,"I always found sea aliens more annoying then land ones, simply because there's no fucking nest to destroy."
civbeyondearth,33dgqm,Dredge6,2,Wed Apr 22 18:42:57 2015 UTC,True. Exploring early on can be pretty annoying with constant attacks. I like to keep my naval units near my cities and wait until they've upgraded a bit.
civbeyondearth,33dgqm,iborobotosis23,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"IMO, prioritize settlers. With that many cities, I think clinics are definitely worth it - health, science, for not that many hammers. (Soyuz/Apollo player.)"

civbeyondearth,335zx2,19683dw,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:42:14 2015 UTC,Haven't experienced this issue in my 25 hours of gameplay.. But i think you should submit the bug to the devs! :)
civbeyondearth,33469d,Bestpaperplaneever,7,Sun Apr 19 10:39:19 2015 UTC,"This was one of the first things I thought of when planting the game as well! Maybe because I play KSP?  POLAR ORBITS could allow for a mapping satellite to pass over the entire planet, moving vertically up then down in successive lines. Maybe a comm/spy satellite could use this to father data as it passed over the planet, closer it is to a city, the more info you collected. Is this useful for any other kind of satellite? To do this, I would imagine you need to answer a parameters when it is built/launched, namely how fast/high. Higher orbits could require more hammers to build but cross the planet faster.  DECAY Its possible that the satellites decay, not their orbits. Maybe the game doesn't word it this way, but I always imagined that the satellite components fell apart. Even if the satellite was unable to perform station keeping, it wouldn't fall out of orbit so quickly, as you pointed out. It's easier (less dV) to push up to a graveyard orbit rather than decay to the atmosphere.  GEOSTATIONARY for some satellites, being stationary is useful, but this should only be an option one per horizontal tile, I.e. one dimension is relevant but not two. Like you said, satellites above the equator would pass across the equator during the orbit. I always assumed the game placed satellites in a geosynchronous orbit with that point, but realistically this satellite would be above that point once per day and above lots of other points as well.  ORBITAL PATHS So, maybe when we place a satellite in orbit, it traces this path above the map for locations it benefits. This means satellite areas should look like diagonal lines, not hexagons."
civbeyondearth,33469d,halberdierbowman,1 point,Sun Apr 19 12:03:41 2015 UTC,"Could be implemented via things that i could describe as ""orbital currents."" as in when you go into orbital view you see several lines to indicate that things in those areas move along those areas, and are perpetually moving, where as the areas with out the ""currents"" are stationary. Sometimes the lines would shift potentially leading to orbital collisions, or that could already be a factor without the lines shifting.  This could be fun then for scouting, harvesting resources, and for offensive military strikes. Like you analyze your orbital currents determine one also goes over your opponents capital so you send up a few planet carvers, and wait for them to line up, say in 5 turns, and then you can coordinate a strike as such.  EDIT: Upon further reading of your post...your orbital paths are practically exactly what i described...lol"
civbeyondearth,33469d,cowfudger,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:11:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe a comm/spy satellite could use this to father data as it passed over the planet, closer it is to a city, the more info you collected.   Father data? A communications satellite would be better off in geostationary orbit though. There could also be non-military planetary observation satellites for resource location and perhaps something like ""wormsign"".   Higher orbits could require more hammers to build but cross the planet faster.   Although realistically, a higher orbit would cause a satellite to cross the planet more slowly. Its orbit would decay more slowly, however.   GEOSTATIONARY for some satellites, being stationary is useful, but this should only be an option one per horizontal tile, I.e. one dimension is relevant but not two.   You mean it should be possible only once per longitude?   This means satellite areas should look like diagonal lines, not hexagons.   It should look something like  http://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/uars-map.jpg"
civbeyondearth,33469d,halberdierbowman,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:15:16 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more of spy satellites that had cameras looking directly down at an opposing city, although I think your idea of finding resources could be useful as well. You're right that comm satellites probably should be easy to find in the sky all the time in the same place.  That sounds like a decent tradeoff right there: 200 hammers for 20 turns or 250 hammers for 30 turns or 300 hammers for 40 turns. The better you build the satellite he longer it stays in orbit. You could visually see its lifespan if it tracked its orbital path exactly once per lifespan, so higher satellites move slower.  Yes, my understanding is that one satellite per longitude (horizontal tile) makes sense if we are using an equatorial geostationary orbit.  Yup, exactly like that picture. I would imagine the satellite would only be above a handful of those tiles at a time though, so you might get six tiles in a diagonal row with a benefit for each turn."
civbeyondearth,33469d,Alexnikolias,2,Fri Apr 24 12:01:37 2015 UTC,This was one my biggest complaints when I got to play the alpha. I was really hoping they came up with a better system before release.   Satellite view is just an overlay I never bothered with during retail. I know there a ton of bonuses to be had but it's just cumbersome to keep track of on top of every thing else.   I know it would severely dumb down some gameplay options but I would rather satellites be city improvements only with big strategic resource costs so not every city can have them or even multiple.

civbeyondearth,32rp3e,lilgamefreek,16,Thu Apr 16 04:12:38 2015 UTC,"I've been posting regular progress and collecting feedback at Civfanatics: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=545870  A couple of things since my last post. I'm beginning to start the design of each of the tree's virtues, though not committing anything to gameplay yet. They're all written-notes at the moment. Almost all of the big picture mechanics have been implemented, with the exception of diplomatic modifiers when selecting an opponent's aversion. The problem is that it's impossible to create new diplo-modifiers without modifying the game's .dll and almost as hard to apply diplo-modifiers. I'm still investigating whether there are any dummy modifiers left in the game from Civ5 that are unused.  I'm still have great conversations with people however about ideas like hybrid engineering trees, or alternatives to the diplomacy category of things, so don't be afraid to voice your opinions of big picture stuff all because I said it's already implemented.  If you want to talk about what is actually going into each tree, I've written up some small summaries that I've been using to help me guide the design of each one. Feel free to give feedback on what I'm doing right or wrong. Some are still pretty vague as I haven't formed much that is concrete.  Politics helps manage the will of your citizens and cities.   Police States offer tools for managing the unrest caused by large societies, maximizing the amount of growth that can be earned from limited resources and services. This is all done at the cost of civil harmony, and Police States receive fewer benefits when society is prosperous. Pluralist societies accelerates societal growth as ambitious individuals settle new lands or raise new families. So many opinions makes it difficult for pluralist societies to support causes through organized action. Fundamentalist societies rely on loyalty and conviction. The larger a following the society has, the more powerful it becomes. Unerring loyalty hurts the society's ability to innovate however, particularly in the field of research and scientific advance.   Economics develops your state’s resources, infrastructure, and economy.   Free Markets are unrivaled in their ability to adapt to economic changes. Such flexibility makes it an all-around good choice. However, Free Market require a stable political climate and unrest is often extremely disruptive. Planned economics attempts to overpower economic forces with rationale and logic, pouring resources into growth and industry for long-term benefits rather than short-term profits. Because a Planned economy struggles against its natural course, it is often bogged down with inefficiencies.  Green economics focuses on community health and sustainable economic growth. Green economics maximizes profits earned per unit resources rather than net profits and ensures there remains enough for following generations. This makes it slower to grow than other economic plans.   Values guide the heart of your people, determining where their priorities lie.   Dominance is about strength and superiority, whether it be over other states, countrymen, or fellow neighbors. Those who work for another’s benefit are looked upon with disdain, making jobs in industry and labor undesirable.  Progressive societies are concerned with the mark left on the universe by humanity as a whole. Aspects such as culture and science, which advance all people, are their focus. Their relaxed views make Progressive societies more open to infiltration however. Wealth focused societies exalt the individual's ability to produce for himself. Such societies are excellent at business and at turning resources into usable materials. A Wealth focused society's nature to only think for themselves makes individuals unwilling to fight for others.   Diplomacy informs your interactions with the rest of the world.   Aggressive diplomacy confers benefits best used on foreign soil. The actions of Aggressive societies often strain relationships with foreign powers and can shake its member's belief of the legitimacy of their government. Cooperative diplomacy is best when relationships between foreign powers are peaceful. Cooperation brings better trade and bonuses to both partners. Cooperation falls apart when there is no one to cooperate with and can unintentionally launch rivals into stronger positions. Defensive diplomacy creates states that are difficult to crack or infiltrate. Whether fighting to maintain a lead or for survival, being Defensive is the best method of protecting a society's interests and assets. They suffer from an inability to assert themselves in international matters however."
civbeyondearth,32rp3e,ByronicPhoenix,3,Thu Apr 16 04:19:24 2015 UTC,"That sounds really cool.  Is it possible to mix, by taking some policies from each, free market and green economics?  How would a Pluralist Free-Market Progressive society and a Pluralist Green Wealth society differ? Aside from the latter's greater environmental focus."
civbeyondearth,32rp3e,Yama951,3,Thu Apr 16 18:56:48 2015 UTC,"Pluralist is usual on personal freedoms and rights.  Free Market is, I guess, the pure laissez-faire form of capitalism.  Green is putting the environment over the economy.  Progressive is on culture and science.  Wealth is more on personal ambition and striving to be better in terms of social class.  So a Pluralist Free-Market Progressive society is a place where one has the rights and freedoms to to what you want in the areas of arts, sciences, and the economy, limited only by yourself.  While a Pluralist Green Wealth society is a place where one is free to get wealthy and rich with luxury as long as it either doesn't hurt the environment or cause the least amount of damage possible."
civbeyondearth,32rp3e,Saris_Kai,1 point,Fri Apr 17 08:06:04 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your description of a wealth driven society. Specifically the idea of exalting an individual's ability to produce for themselves. Wealth driven societies will inevitably result in oligarchical power structures as wealth begets wealth. The rise of an oligarchy within such system is inevitable is accumulation of wealth is a central cultural value. They would then foster dependency on their products and services which creates the exact opposite effect of what you are describing.  In general with an entire section dedicated to economic policies already wouldn't it make more sense to have some other form of value?   Also I noticed that Dominance isn't taken to it's logical conclusion from the political science perspective either. Any society built on such an ideal with result in a power structure that denies the majority of it's citizen the liberty to excessive dominance except in a international sense, they would be forced into that crappy labour or service jobs by people within their power structure more dominant than them. I don't really see how a society that enshrines this value wouldn't be a police state by default either, well it could be fundamentalist too. I guess it would just lock out pluralist."
civbeyondearth,32rp3e,Yama951,2,Fri Apr 17 18:08:06 2015 UTC,"I agree that Wealth needs to be renamed into something less obviously connected to Free Market.  But I think Dominance is okay as it is. From the original games, it was called Power. While there will be people forced into labor jobs, it's usually because, in a society under that value, they're not that assertive over their rights and freedoms, or receptive in doing such a job. To those who believe in Dominance, it shows weakness for not pushing your will against other people.  While it looks like a Police State, it, like Wealth-Free Market, are not the only potential pairing. A Pluralist-Power faction would see that people has the right to speak out and do what they want while wanting to be strong enough to do what they want. It becomes a sort of one up competition to see who's stronger and louder than anyone else in the defense of those rights. You can see quite the determined activists popping up in such a society."
civbeyondearth,32rp3e,Drake55645,3,Fri Apr 17 19:33:35 2015 UTC,"A Pluralist-Power faction sounds like it would be similar to something like Heinlein's Federation in Starship Troopers (the book).  Everyone has basic individual rights and freedoms, but in order to vote you have to serve the state for a couple of years and they're decidedly not averse to using force to advance the Federation's goals, particularly against aliens."
civbeyondearth,32rp3e,Yama951,2,Sun Apr 19 18:35:28 2015 UTC,"It really depends on where the value is directed at. In my interpretation, it's Power for the rights and freedoms of the individual against those that might take them away, hence the potentially militant but determined and passionate activists angle. In Heinlein's, it's more focus on the survival of the human species against an alien other. Either interpretation works.  Pluralistic was originally called Democratic so that could work as well.  Also, the original description of Power does promote the military, Knowledge promotes teachers and scientists, and Wealth promotes the rich and the self made man."
civbeyondearth,32rp3e,Drake55645,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:45:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see.  So with Power/Dominance you're sort of going for a ""Don't Tread On Me"" type view of rights and freedoms?  I could totally see that."
civbeyondearth,32rp3e,bmhadoken,3,Mon Apr 20 14:31:55 2015 UTC,How does the AI handle all of this?
civbeyondearth,32rp3e,Yama951,8,Thu Apr 16 07:23:01 2015 UTC,"Civ is suprisingly flexible in allowing custom rules for things such as policyt requirements, building requirements, unit requirements, etc. Civ5 has lots of custom scenarios with custom items, such as the Scramble for Africa scenario that featured custom policy trees for each subset of groups. This has all translated to BE. The system is really just 12 virtue trees with some specially coded rules and interactions that the AI follows faithfully.  This doesn't mean the AI can make intelligent choices around the changes however, and it's for this reason that I don't allow the AI to switch between trees. As far as it's concerned, it's just the usual virtue system, only some options are locked off when it adopts a new policy. It doesn't sweat it and just picks virtues it can adopt that suits its needs, just like the current AI does."

civbeyondearth,32henl,DXS0T8S,4,Tue Apr 14 03:21:52 2015 UTC,"On steam workshop, this is what I use.  Listing their names here.    Awesome Stations - Makes them generally more powerful and forces them to land further away from cities and outposts to cut down on expansion blocking.    TERA (Technology Expansion and Affinity Realignment) - Adds more affinity buildings and bonuses to leaf techs, making affinities and tech choices feel more unique.    Visually Distinctive Terrains - One for each Biome, in my opinion it makes them look better and more color rich.    Larger Maps - One of my favorites.    Purity 1331 - Swaps Purity bonuses 1 and 3, feels more fun to me. Bonus vs Aliens comes first with it, Explorer immunity from them later.    Player color for units - Some early units will have player color, kind of fun in the start.    Brasilia Better Start - Makes Brasilia start with an extra Soldier on top of their current bonuses. Is balanced and fun for me, a Brasilia player.    Alien Hostility - First mod of my creation, effectively increases how much activities anger Aliens and makes the anger decay slower - though friendliness from nests within borders is also increased. Alien nests are particularly relevant to angering them, and Siege Worms and Krakens spawn later.    City Combat Rebalance - Second mod I made, not for everyone. City barrages won't do as much damage, cities heal a bit less quickly, and melee units only take 1 damage when attacking a city. Use if you like not always needing to make most of your army ranged units.    Dome Upgrade - Third and final mod I made, improves the Dome by removing its maintenance cost and changing its Biosphere upgrade to +1 food from +1 energy. More useful, balanced, flavorful, and tactically diverse from a Terrascape this way.      EDIT: Nevermind the warning, I saw a Siege Worm!  Well, two actually - odd that I saw two for the first time at turn 258 Marathon.  Anyway, the Alien Hostility mod should work fine, just ask if you want a version where Siege Worms can appear before turn 200.  In the meantime, I have worms to hunt."

Visually Distinctive Terrain is also great, as people have mentioned.   Recolored tech tree makes the tech tree easier to read.

civbeyondearth,3278z7,Thefriendlyfaceplant,1 point,Sat Apr 11 10:42:43 2015 UTC,"Ah, cool, I think they did it in an earlier version too because I thought it was way earlier than 2010."
civbeyondearth,3278z7,kodemage,-6,Sat Apr 11 17:19:06 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why devs sometimes do things like this. Frustrating someone who already pirated the game doesn't gain you anything! It can only potentially lose you more sales, since some people do buy games they've pirated, but obviously won't if they think the game is frustrating/broken/whatever. Or worse, maybe they'll tell their friends who might have bought the game that it sucks.  What is their end game here? As far as I can tell they only stand to lose by doing this. I can't see anyone going ""oh this game is terrible ... maybe the non-pirated version is better? I guess I'll buy it now!"""
civbeyondearth,3278z7,Ravek,9,Sat Apr 11 22:05:34 2015 UTC,Because it's hilarious?
civbeyondearth,3278z7,kodemage,4,Sat Apr 11 23:05:53 2015 UTC,"Or word spreads that, oh crap, the pirated game is unplayable.  People aren't that stupid.  They do it to discourage pirating in the first place, thanks to the Internet people hear about such development shenanigans pretty quickly.  Source: a pirate in the dorm next to mine.  Also, I can practically smell the sea salt on you.  Try to be a little more subtle."
civbeyondearth,3278z7,Drake55645,2,Sun Apr 12 00:40:14 2015 UTC,"Unlike traditional DRM we're talking about hidden negatives. Obviously those aren't going to discourage piracy, you can't be discouraged by anything you aren't aware of!  Also nice personal attack bro. You see downvotes so you figure the hive mind won't turn on you if you just throw out some rude remarks I don't deserve – real brave. Fact is it's impossible to be salty about this since I wouldn't even know if I'd been affected by it. Besides what the fuck would I care, I have plenty of disposable income to buy whatever games I like. I'm just trying to figure out what a developer could possibly logically get out of this – so far, no good arguments for the practice. You're welcome to disagree but I don't see why you have to make an ass of yourself for it. Especially since at no point I even indicated being frustrated by the practice – just surprised."
civbeyondearth,3278z7,Ravek,3,Sun Apr 12 03:56:47 2015 UTC,"The sea salt thing was an attempted pirate joke, apparently it fell quite flat.  I'd hardly call that a personal attack in either context, though.  And nah, I made the comment when you were at like one downvote.  Go ask TumblrInAction, I don't give a crap about the hivemind.  My point is that something like this is a humorous attempt to deter piracy - as previously noted, word spreads really quickly about this kind of thing, and everyone gets a good laugh out of it except the pirates, and pirates really have no right to complain.  Basically, it's the developers having fun at the expense of would-be pirates.  Keks are had by all and the pirates get an impossible game for their trouble."
civbeyondearth,3278z7,Drake55645,9,Sun Apr 12 06:01:05 2015 UTC,LOL yeah thats happened to me a few times on Vostok difficulty. If you find a nest near you at planetfall you got to deal with it right away or the aliens just fester and grow larger.
civbeyondearth,3278z7,simonpheenicks,5,Sat Apr 11 04:46:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's take an objective look at the terrain.  To your south-west you have two adjacent tiles that are hill and forest right outside your border.  Block them off with Marines.  West and north-west are one-tile spaces.  Block them off with Marines as well, with Ranger backup.  The only access for the xenos now is for the Drones to fly over the canyons, exposing them to both Ranger AND city fire.  That's going to be your big military investment.  Next, construct a gunboat, a Marine, and a settler.  Send them up along the eastern coast or over to that island to your east.  Establish your second city.  By this point you should have been moving towards Ultrasonic Fences.  The second you get them, build one in your capital.  Use those military forces to hunt down the alien nest."
civbeyondearth,3278z7,Drake55645,3,Sat Apr 11 16:18:09 2015 UTC,"Seriously, that canyon placement is amazing for defense. I would have murdered for that kind of terrain to defend.  I had to slug it out with the bugs in nothing but woods."
civbeyondearth,3278z7,Erosion010,4,Sat Apr 11 20:45:02 2015 UTC,Should have bought the tile. A friendly alien is a good alien.

civbeyondearth,3278z7,Wrynfroe,6,Sat Apr 11 07:39:07 2015 UTC,50~60 turns of suffering for 100 turns of peace. Only good when you wanna go for late game.
civbeyondearth,3278z7,h2odragon00,2,Sat Apr 11 10:32:28 2015 UTC,Wait.  Are you saying that if you buy a tile with an alien unit on it you get the unit?
civbeyondearth,3278z7,h2odragon00,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:16:52 2015 UTC,No. Aliens will be friendly towards you after some turns. That happens when the aliens icon become cyan(?). You still can't control the aliens but they won't attack your units. This is world wide and they remain friendly as long as the nest in your territory is not destroyed. Compared it to having the old Purity 1 Explorer applied to all your units.  I tend to do this when there are a lot of aliens around my city.
civbeyondearth,3278z7,bmhadoken,7,Thu Apr 23 00:44:42 2015 UTC,"Meh. 3-4 marine squads, maybe a ranger if you're either impatient or nervous, poke the aliens a few times to piss them off, then hunker down while the front waves relentlessly suicide into your wall of guns."

civbeyondearth,3278z7,bmhadoken,1 point,Sat Apr 11 06:34:31 2015 UTC,"I've used that tactic to push down and clear nests very close to my landing site even with frenzied aliens. I think the tacjets are just overkill. As I said, A1 soldiers with perhaps some ranger support, and bring a colonist along for the ride, you should be set for anything but siege worms while you clear the nest and establish your second city"
civbeyondearth,3278z7,lunrSabr94,3,Sat Apr 11 08:55:40 2015 UTC,"I actually never attack the aliens, and by turn 50 or so they turn into allies, which means they never attack you (unless you aggravate them), don't blockade tiles and they're pretty much a natural defense system against other civs' explorations and attacks. Also the nests make a really great tile :) They can get annoying if you wanna build roads though..."
civbeyondearth,3278z7,lunrSabr94,1 point,Sat Apr 11 13:57:52 2015 UTC,"Can you expand on that? The ""they turn into allies"" thing. Because my strategy for this game was to try to leave the aliens alone, but it seems like that just stoked their curiosity in my new and modern city."
civbeyondearth,3278z7,lunrSabr94,11,Sun Apr 12 00:18:44 2015 UTC,"So the game has this alien influence system where certain actions you do (or not do) to the aliens increases or decreases your score, netting a positive or negative influence towards the aliens. This is reflected by the aliens' unit symbols' color: green is neutral, blue is ally, orange is hostile, and red is ""we are going to burn your cities and slaughter your people"".  You can ally with the aliens in the following way: never attack the aliens (i.e. don't move units into them or range-attack them in any way; them attacking you is fine though), and that keeps on adding positive influence to them. They'll attack you if you're too close to their nest, and it's very probable that they would just march through your territory like you're complaining, but resist the temptation to attack them still.  This will keep on racking up positive influence, until the alien unit symbols turn from green to blue, and that's when they're your allies! They never attack you even if you come close to their nests, and even if they come into your territory they don't blockade your tiles (you can still use them even if aliens are occupying them). At that point there will be a ton of aliens around your colony, which will act as a natural barrier against any invading force or nosy neighbour. Also if you manage to buy (or get) a tile with an alien nest on it, definitely use these tiles as their yield is great and they actually give you xenomass later on in the game (I believe), and make sure to always protect these nests too (if the aliens don't do that for you).  And there you have it! This is great if you're playing harmony like I do, and it's definitely a very OP strategy ;)  EDIT: read all about the aliens' behaviour here!"
civbeyondearth,3278z7,General_Pants,2,Sun Apr 12 01:06:33 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the comprehensive answer! I will definitely try this strategy next time, as I really like the harmony strategy already. Happy gaming!"

To me your specs look great, so I'll assume that if it's you not meeting the system requirements it would be that, otherwise I'd suggest maybe making sure all your drivers are up to date? I believe BE isn't as optimized as Civ V since I can run the latter fine but for BE I have to tune down the options a bit to get good FPS...I guess the final thing I'd resort to is that the game doesn't like something specific about your setup, maybe that would be something you might find out with extensive googling I guess. Good luck!"

civbeyondearth,322wj3,lilgamefreek,4,Fri Apr 10 03:31:18 2015 UTC,"This is going to be really vague, so I apologize in advance.  The Purity wallpaper almost looks like it has a Supremacy background, with the incredibly angular design, whereas Supremacy and Harmony both have very fitting-feeling backgrounds.  I have no idea what, if anything, would look more fitting, so I'm just throwing it out there.  Note that this is hardly a major criticism.  Up until like a day or so ago I had the Purity one as my wallpaper.  And for what it's worth the Harmony one is legitimately stunning."
civbeyondearth,322wj3,Galgus,3,Fri Apr 10 05:27:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and yes, that totally makes sense. I'm thinking of giving the Purity one a red grid - styled background instead."
civbeyondearth,322wj3,Galgus,6,Fri Apr 10 05:39:02 2015 UTC,I would recommend flag or banner iconography for purity instead. Right now it seems too busy. Giving the impression that the logo and quote are back dropped by a clear and simple flag of some sort would be more in keeping with their attitude I feel.
civbeyondearth,322wj3,Commandolam,2,Fri Apr 10 09:36:32 2015 UTC,"I would love this, and it would play into the general Purity aesthetic better.  Somehow referencing Earth could also be cool, but it might just be clutter that wouldn't fit.  Edit: This may be a bad idea, but comparing the Harmony poster to the other two not only shows a more multifaceted design, but also references the indigoish secondary color that complements Harmony's dominant green color, while the others are black with the main color.  It kind of works with Supremacy with their yellow, black, and grey color scheme, but Purity looks a bit cold with a black background rather than its traditional warm and earthy brown secondary color.  It also doesn't seem to glow like the other affinity symbols.  I think that and the line pattern design is what gave it a bit of a Supremacy vibe when I first saw it, though I couldn't really place it."
civbeyondearth,322wj3,El_Barto_227,3,Fri Apr 10 09:44:16 2015 UTC,"I love them all, honestly.  My only critique is that the Supremacy one looks a little bare and dark compared to the others - it could use more under the text and to the sides.  Maybe extend the fading effect to the edge of the screen, or add something else on top of it?"
civbeyondearth,322wj3,El_Barto_227,2,Fri Apr 10 03:54:08 2015 UTC,Thanks man - thats exactly the kinda stuff I was looking for.

As far as watching videos of gameplay. A few things to that. I don't like to for one. I don't care to see people playing what I can't experience.   Also the image isn't ever the exact same. When I'm actually in the game I have issues with the colors. But when watching someone else on TV play, I can see more detail but still struggle.   Lastly I got the game technically before launch. I was already committed to the purchase.   I should have waited. Love Civ V. Hate BE.   My non color blind friend bought it when it was half off. He won't be playing it.   There's other issues I have. But the color is atrocious. They didn't think about it.   I've messaged the devs before. Gave suggestions. Posted on sub's and forums.

civbeyondearth,31wu5l,lilgamefreek,11,Wed Apr 8 19:53:25 2015 UTC,"Hey everybody. I know I released the Ocean City mod not too long ago, but even before than I've been working on taking the best aspects from BE's virtue system and SMAC's Social Engineering system. Finally, it's to a point that I can start seeing my changes in-game!  For those who aren't familiar with Alpha Centauri's Social Engineering, it was a method of selecting different styles of governance, economics, and aspects of daily life which would give you both benefits and drawbacks. For example, player's would need to choose between exercising a free market or a planned economy, and switching between the two might better adapt them for the current situation, but would prove costly in the short term. The system has a few additional quirks to it that I can't go into detail here.  Lots of things are going to be changing as time goes on. I'll be playing around with dependencies, creating new art, and of course fleshing out what bonuses the virtues will actually have. I'm making this post to both share my progress as well as get early feedback on ideas and suggestions before I arrive at a playable version.  What I have at the moment: - A perfectly clean slate. All virtues appear and are adoptable. Kicker virtues for each branch are implemented as 3/2/2. Adopting a branch in one category will block off your ability to adopt virtues in the other 2. There is no ability to switch your branch atm.  What I'm thinking of doing: - The ability to switch between different branches of each category. Player's would only be able to switch when they have a free virtue and will lose that virtue upon switching. I'm uncertain how many virtues should be refunded from the branch that is being abandoned.   Kicker policies award penalties rather than bonuses. This is to represent the player specializing in a particular social value and incurring penalties for doing so. This will be counter balanced by relatively strong ""third-level"" virtues that are easy to access. This will also encourage players to fully ""flesh-out"" their government by developing all areas. Having the virtues selected affect diplomacy. Of course the Diplomacy category will play a factor in this, but also I plan to add to the various factions preferences and aversions that affect their outlook on others. Selecting a factions preference, such as Hutama's preference for Wealth, will make him look more favorably on you, while selecting a faction's aversion, such as Kavitha's aversion to aggression, will make cause tension between you and them. Also, playing as a particular faction will disallow you from selecting their aversion. Nice new backgrounds for each of the branches, similar to Civ5's social policies, to make it look a little more unique from BE's current system.   At this point I haven't put any thought into the virtues themselves. Considering there are 42 new virtues (including the kickers) I will need to add, ideas for their bonuses, effects, and art are certainly appreciated! Like really, REALLY appreciated! An ETA on release is unknown. I don't see myself finishing this for a few months at least."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,AP_RAMMUS_OK,6,Wed Apr 8 19:56:53 2015 UTC,"I'm uncertain how many virtues should be refunded from the branch that is being abandoned.   I'd say none. The loss of a single virtue is enough, given how the cost always increases for the next one.   Though, if you can trigger resistance in all cities,perhaps even allow the player to keep the new one, but your cities all go on strike..."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,AP_RAMMUS_OK,5,Wed Apr 8 20:45:12 2015 UTC,"By none, I assume you mean you get all of the virtues back to spend on your new tree? At the moment, I'm going with vanilla Civ5's lead (so pre-expansions) on this, though I can customize it very easily."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,AP_RAMMUS_OK,3,Wed Apr 8 22:18:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean you get to reassign all the ones you've got, but you've lost that particular opportunity to gain one more.  In Civ 5, changing ideology is a much bigger deal than I think you're going for. Strategically, you don't do it unless your happiness is making you, and you don't get in that situation without making mistakes. Basically, 9 times out of 10, if you have to change ideologies, you dun goofed, and it always feels punishing."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,Velrei,2,Wed Apr 8 22:48:23 2015 UTC,"I actually meant pre-BNW where you couldn't take Piety alongside Rationalism. Things like that. The ideology system wasn't so entrenched with the happiness and tourist system back then, so it was just like any other blocking policy tree. Back then, switching trees was just because one tree would fit you better than the other and you would lose out on all the policies and suffer a turn of anarchy. In that sense, the current ideology system is a little more forgiving as you can salvage some of your tenets at least.  For better or for worse, the code to BLOCK such trees is still there, but not the code to switch. That needs to be re-implemented by me, so I have a large amount of power to change it."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,Velrei,3,Wed Apr 8 22:59:09 2015 UTC,"Ah, I have to be honest and say I didn't play much pre-BNW and had forgotten.I'd suggest a light touch and playtesting to see if switching seems too powerful or easy, and how much it can set you behind.   Of course, I'd happily volunteer for such a role!"
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,Galgus,2,Wed Apr 8 23:04:29 2015 UTC,Sure thing! There's lots of possibilities at the moment and I'll be sure to report more on my progress as the mod becomes more and more playable.
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,Galgus,3,Wed Apr 8 23:46:44 2015 UTC,"Looks like an interesting project, I'm glad someone is working on SMAC related stuff (The factions collection was nice, although I still wish Miriam had more of a science de-buff, like getting culture instead of science from trade routes)  The kickers giving penalties is an interesting concept, although I'm slightly worried about it from a fun perspective. SMAC does provide a wealth of ideas to add interesting ones at least.   I am wondering how ""Green"" is going to work in the context of most factions not dealing with the wildlife. That, and it being a pretty strict Harmony thing."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,Galgus,3,Thu Apr 9 22:12:53 2015 UTC,"I've never viewed ""Green"" economics as a purely harmony or transcendence path. I've always viewed green economics as placing priority on sustainable economic growth and community health. You can see how that makes it distinct from the concepts of free market and planned economics. Out of all of the original SMAC social engineering types, the economic choices are the most likely ones I'll keep completely intact in theme."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,KimbalKinnison,2,Thu Apr 9 23:20:53 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, since Health is a mechanic SMAC didn't have on top of that. I look forward to the results!"
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,Drake55645,6,Thu Apr 9 23:27:15 2015 UTC,"I'm admittedly not a real SMAC fan, as I found the game distopian and depressing more often than not and prefer how one's society works to be kept more vague.  With that admission of bias out of the way, a more distinctively Beyond Earth way to go about this would be to have affinity-based social policies and values that can be adopted.  How affinities really affect society and the political issues they could bring isn't very well explored in the game at the moment while being a central theme.  I don't mean to tell you what to do with your mod - its just an idea."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,Drake55645,3,Wed Apr 8 23:51:22 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting one to be certain. Having the possibility to choose political, economic, values, or diplomacy policies that grow one of the three affinities would be a very interesting and different approach. It would offer, as well, an alternative way of getting ahead to the affinity victory seperate from the current tech heavy way. It's a cool system that I could play around with. I'm working off a completely blank slate atm.  Something cool about that approach is that you wouldn't necessarily need to block out the other trees, as hybrid affinities come fairly naturally."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,JimTor,2,Thu Apr 9 00:07:50 2015 UTC,"Theoretically some policies could be more or less cross-affinity friendly, like Purity augmentation regulations perhaps being exclusive or restrictive to Supremacy policies and the like.  Or perhaps it would be fine to simply bury them deep in an Affinity's tree while perhaps requiring certain affinity levels to unlock them.  That said I don't know how such a system would work ideally with what each policy or value would be and what they would do, let alone what would be code-able.  I took a stab at trying to think of Affinity-related policies in an old idea thread detailing a secondary policy system, though it was focused on drastic changes locked into a single affinity.  I think it would be difficult to fill the virtue screen with such policies."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,Tannish,3,Thu Apr 9 00:34:41 2015 UTC,"The worry with making prerequisites for anything virtue related is soft blocking the players' play when they runs out of virtues to select. At the moment the game offers 60 virtues with no real restrictions on getting them. The current Social Engineering with mutual exclusion offers 28 (assuming the player never switches branches), but once the 28 is reached, the player can unblock by switching to a new branch (which is un-ideal. Tweaking rate of virtue gain will likely be a critical part of this mod). Without mutual exclusion, it would be 84. The moment you make affinity levels or technologies a prerequisite, you make it possible for player's to get soft-blocked for not choosing the right affinities or techs in time.   I also want to avoid tieing culture into tech (which affinities are already tied to). Too many things are tied to tech and culture shouldn't be one of them. The more thought I put into this, the more I like the idea of having affinities depend on virtues AND tech, so players can go either route to develop their affinity."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,Saris_Kai,2,Thu Apr 9 18:21:05 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the biggest issue with changing virtues to being affinity based.  If they are restricted to one tree, it could feel bland and a step down from the diversity of the current system with players running out of virtues.  If they are open it leads to weird scenarios where lategame everyone is every affinity - kind of killing the ""affinities play differently"" theme that would be the point of it.  It feels like it would live better as a secondary culture system like Ideologies were in BNW - but that is beyond mod territory.    I like the idea of tech being less dominant in affinity development, and culture playing a role."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,DefiantMars,3,Thu Apr 9 19:18:12 2015 UTC,"Well the way I'm imagining it is like three trees representing each affinity. Virtues take on a similar position as techs in that you can develop your culture in a way that is a hybrid between the affinities or you can barrel down one tree to level your dominant affinity more. In some ways it makes the virtue system too similar to the tech system in gameplay and feel less unique, but it would help divorce the affinity from the tech system and make it something that develops alongside your entire empire."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,DefiantMars,3,Thu Apr 9 19:48:47 2015 UTC,Love the idea!
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,DefiantMars,3,Wed Apr 8 21:24:55 2015 UTC,"Is there any possibility of having some ability to take different paths in Values and Politics?  One issue I had with SMAC was that those categories aren't actually mutually exclusive; it is more than possible to have all three or any combination thereof.  If I may, and this is just as suggestion, I'd say you could take a bit more liberty with defining politics at the very least, so that they're truly contradictory.  Perhaps rename them to political ideals - personal liberty/religious law/police state.  It's really just a nitpick, though, I'm loving what you're doing."
civbeyondearth,31wu5l,rosenskimmer,3,Wed Apr 8 22:12:46 2015 UTC,It's something that I could definitely play around with and I'm not necessarily planning to stick very closely to SMAC (as you can see I replaced the late-game societies with diplomacy options instead). And kind of want to hear what people think about the old social engineering system and how they might approach it as it's not talked about very often in this day and age.

I recommend just doing a playthrough on a low difficulty and feeling your way through the techweb so you can get used to it. First, research the techs in the center area, in any particular order; chemistry, physics, pioneering, genetics, engineering, and ecology. This will get you a nice, happy bundle of buildings that you can use to get your feet off the ground.   From here you can expand further into the web in any direction you please, as whatever your surrounding environment deems necessary. If there's xenomass nearby, for instance, research Alien Sciences (branching off from ecology and genetics) so you can build a xenomass well and tap it; it's a very valuable tile, even before you build the buildings that go with it. If there's a nearby Firaxite deposit, research Robotics (towards the left) and build a mine there for a nice science yield. Want to get an edge on your neighbors, spywise? research computers and get a spy agency built. Just take it all one step at a time."

civbeyondearth,31hoy0,Kronossan,6,Mon Apr 6 08:22:58 2015 UTC,"If I may throw in my two cents.   Prioritize Explorers early on.  You really want those bonuses, especially if you can nab Progenitor Ruins, which may very well grant you a free Affinity level of your choice. The Virtue trees are really versatile, but the first tier of Prosperity is literally always worth it, as is Pathfinders at the top of the second tier, netting you some sweet extra Explorer expedition modules. Prioritize Affinity.  Even if you're going for a peaceful victory, you will piss somebody off at some point and you will get wrecked if you don't have roughly equivalent Affinity levels - also, Affinity-specific buildings are extremely useful. Trade routes.  If you want a ton of money, roll on down to the Alternative Markets virtue in the second tier of Industry.  +6 energy per Station tier - that means a maxed-out Station is sending you 18 energy/turn in addition to its other bonuses.  If you have the option, send your foreign trade routes to Stations rather than other civs. Espionage.  Even if you're not actively stealing stuff (which you should be doing), at the very least have agents out there keeping an eye on enemy production. Keep an eye on your enemies' Affinity.  The second somebody reaches Affinity 13, make sure you have an agent in their capital to keep an eye on things.  They will be going for a victory Wonder soon, at which point you should apply gratuitous violence to their faces. Phasal Transporters (come with Cybernetics tech).  It doesn't matter what Affinity you went with, it's almost always worth going out of your way to get these little miracles.  With some planning, you can literally materialize an invasion right next to your enemy's capital, or you can have an astonishingly mobile defense force.  Ever wanted to take advantage of an inland lake or sea but don't have a port on it?  Congrats, with the Transporter you can drop a fleet right into it.  It's magical, really. Health.  Negative health is far more survivable than negative happiness, but keeping it positive will net you some handy bonuses and at the very least avoid penalties.  Also, health buildings often produce science or culture as well - there's no good reason not to make Clinics a number one or two build priority in a new city.  Get either Magnasanti (Industry, +0.2 Health per building) or Eudaimonia (Prosperity, -15% negative Health).  If you go for the latter you'll have insanely good health, since that path also includes or passes by Joy From Variety (each type of basic resource produces +1 Health) and Mind Over Matter (+7 Health)."
civbeyondearth,31hoy0,Drake55645,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:42:15 2015 UTC,"If you know sc2, you know about timing attacks. Build a bunch of low tier units when they're cheap - right before you get enough affinity to upgrade. Giving you a lot of high tech units that cost less production. Go stomp your neighbor with your sudden leap in strength. E.g. rangers at 2 affinity, armor at 3 affinity. Your 4 affinity unit is also good, especially battlesuits.  You need to rapid expand. Colonists are awesome to rush buy if you have the energy. Unhealth isn't as bad as lots of cities is good. Cram them together as closely as possible. Cities on hills get defense AND extra production. Emphasize early game strength (resources next to it, less worker turns needed to get started) over long term for your first cities to get the snowball rolling. Sometimes defensibility is better than the perfect spot or one more city you can't hold.  Generators are surprisingly good for balancing your budget.  Science is really, really important. So getting foreign trade routes and academies, firaxite, etc should be a priority. If there are lots of aliens to kill, Survivalism in the Might tree gives you tons of it (plus a veteran army to invade your neighbor).  Finally, if you're warmongering, commit to it. Like in SC2, macro matters more than micro. So have all your cities making units until you have the numbers to steamroll him."
civbeyondearth,31hoy0,bea_bear,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:22:14 2015 UTC,You should wait till the game gets patches and better. Civ V is still a better game and I play by far more than BE. I am still waiting for an expansion or patches to balance the game.
civbeyondearth,31hoy0,jkohatsu,3,Mon Apr 6 00:51:02 2015 UTC,"This may not be the main source, but they have announced some sort of plan to spice the game up - make it feel less bland.  Theoretically such changes would also look to patch up balance."

civbeyondearth,31cfvr,lordhadri,3,Tue Apr 14 16:40:23 2015 UTC,"That was my biggest disappointment with this game. I actually like the mechanics for the most part but it's the same damn planet every time, with the same aliens. And Civ-like water oceans defining the shape of the map at that. That's not the point of a SciFi game."
civbeyondearth,31cfvr,lordhadri,4,Sat Apr 4 02:08:37 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I would have much more fun exploring the strange, new world if it wasn't so functionally uniform to every other one.  As a side note I'm also a fan of making Aliens much more dangerous, and willing to swarm cities when provoked.  That would emphasize the threat modifiers seen here."
civbeyondearth,31cfvr,FullplateHero,2,Sat Apr 4 02:12:04 2015 UTC,"Sins of a Solar Empire has the same problem as BE, even worse really, with an end game that isn't very interesting. And it may be years yet before an update to the franchise that finally solves that. But I get into it every time because it's fun to discover strange new worlds and customize and fortify them. BE won't ever grow beyond the fundamentals of Civ that it's based on but a major expansion could at least give us some of that. Honestly the idea of a lava world is so obvious it's gonna be disappointing if it never happens...Harmony players would get different looking units!"
civbeyondearth,31cfvr,FullplateHero,3,Sat Apr 4 04:04:32 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to spice up the late game would be stirring the pot with encouragements for Affinity wars.  The Interstellar Trade Routes system posted recently would also make things more interesting with another layer to play around with, but its hard to beat a good war.  On a related note, AI bonuses could be changed to prop them up less early and more later for a more consistent experience.    I'd had the thought in the past that Harmony could look different based on their home biome.  On a similar note I'd like how Affinity leaders and cities currently look at max affinity to be more of a midpoint, with Starships leader appearances at high level.  For cities, Harmony could begin to have trees and vegetation on their grounds and roofs, with perhaps a Yggdrasil-like tree building in the center.   This could vary with home biome.  Supremacy could have a huge monolithic Nexus building form at the center of their cities, linking all others.  Purity could take on more aesthetic decorations at high levels, with nods to famous  Earth architecture in the center of the city.  Imagine a central Pan-African structure made to resemble and reference the Pyramids, or a similar Franco-Iberian structure resembling the Arc de Triumph!"
civbeyondearth,31cfvr,Drake55645,3,Sat Apr 4 04:18:03 2015 UTC,"Volcanic biome should be weighted to appear along coastlines, as that is usually where the fault lines are. ie; the Pacific Ring. You don't see many volcanoes smack dab in the middle of a continent."

I would love for this to replace Civ 5, but I don't think it's there yet.  Second, just because I think there are some flaws in the game doesn't mean I hate it. In fact, I never said I hate it at all. I have over 70 hours in the game. The point I was attempting to make is I played it for awhile, but it then lost its replay-ability. It doesn't have the amount of possibilities that other Civ games had. Most of the sponsors feel the same, the different map types aren't as amazing as they could be, and there is a lot of lore that needs to be in.  Third, bombarding you? Really? lol All I did was state my opinion in a rather calm matter. I didn't even swear when I stated my opinion.  Fourth, I firmly believe it does contribute to the conversation. If your idea of a conversation is just talking to people that agree with you, then that is sort of sad. What's the point of just being affirmed all the time?   Those are just my beliefs. I can't type this out to everyone that commented, so I decided to leave this here since you had the longest comment. Enjoy! :)"

civbeyondearth,319xhl,Galgus,5,Fri Apr 3 04:13:41 2015 UTC,"I like this.   Initial response: I feel like this would add a fair number of units to the game(if you are constructing a fleet from multiple types of ships: Capital, Frigate, Dreadnought, Fighter, etc.), as well as a complex new facet to strategy. Especially if units would be constructed in a city like other units.   If I were incorporating this into a game of my own, I would add fleet functionality as a tab at the bottom, like Spies/Intrigue, and unlocked by construction of a building(Shipyard or Spaceport) I like the idea of constructing fleets out of different-tiered units, potentially with the ability to tailor fleets for different bonuses(speed, capacity, defense, etc.). So I would have construction separate from the city build queue, and use a set(possibly selectable) percentage of each owned city's production output.   The Shipyard/Spaceport could even be a wonder, Similar to the Manhattan Project or Apollo from Civ V, not limited to a single civ."
civbeyondearth,319xhl,FullplateHero,1 point,Sat Apr 4 08:50:10 2015 UTC,"I worry that adding more types of units to the game beyond the Capital ship would be difficult without them feeling redundant - since currently the ships can be recalled to assist in terrestrial conflicts.  Speaking of which I'm unsure on the current Capital ship balance.  Fundamentally I wanted them to feel powerful but cost-prohibitive in Energy, Titanium, and Geothermal resources.  Fighters as listed here are just how I classify the Tacjet upgrade line, which by this point are affinity combat aircraft.    This would definitely need its own layer, or at least a very good menu, so there would need to be a quick way to examine current military and expeditionary fleets.  I like the idea of tailoring fleets to different roles or strengths, but I'm not sure how it could be done without the aforementioned redundancy.  I kind of prefer each ship to need to be built in a city, so there is an opportunity cost in building them.    Aside more cities being able to aid in production by building Starship Hubs, I thought it could be a fun way to boost smaller cities quickly with the trade routes while requiring an infrastructure investment to do so.  As a one-per-colony Wonder would it simply not require a building to start constructing ship and receiving trade yields?    Its a somewhat rough idea all in all, and it could use all the feedback it can get."
civbeyondearth,319xhl,FullplateHero,2,Sat Apr 4 09:11:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe Fleets could be built as a single unit, and capital ships could be attached to them? This still allows room for customizing fleets, doesn't add a ton of additional unit management, and still has a 'realistic' feel to it. Also still allows you to recall a fleet without have a bunch of redundant units."
civbeyondearth,319xhl,FullplateHero,1 point,Sat Apr 4 12:48:19 2015 UTC,"Like if ships other than the Capital Ship and possibly the smaller current aircraft were not suited for terrestrial combat somehow?

As far as gameplay goes you can choose between the leaders of BE and between Supremacy, Harmony and Purity for different bonuses (something I think the game did rather well).  Small warning if you're buying Starships - it's a good game but not on the scale of the regular Civ games (there's a reason it's Sid Meier's Starships, not Sid Meier's Civilization: Starships). It's far quicker, far more condensed then a Civilization game - all tech, wonders and improvements are instantaneously bought, you never permanently lose your units and the game's a lot smaller.

There are a few issues that I've run into that I'll let everyone know about unless someone more experienced than I am tries their hand at it.   Between Civ V and BE the des basically gutted the entire natural wonder system and so I've had to rebuild it. Not too hard considering that the engines are almost identical, so not too bad but still time consuming.   Next, the modding tools that they've released for BE (at least in my opinion) are garbage and don't make it very easy at all to debug, edit or add things beyond a small range of aspects that they featured the SDK with.   Lastly, and the problem that I've been having so far, the engine still seems to have a terrain/art issue that is art holdover from CIV V. To expand, the art renderer seems to object to new art being added after the game start and there seems to be no way to force it to. As such, once you manage to get the natural wonders placed properly, they don't appear with the art that they should.   Just a PSA.  If anyone has specific questions they can PM me and I'll answer what I can."
civbeyondearth,315i13,eius1989,2,Sun Apr 5 17:32:43 2015 UTC,Awesome to know that this is something that people are working on. I have absolutely zero modding skills whatsoever so can't offer any help but can instead offer encouragement.  Wish you all the luck in getting this up and running :)
civbeyondearth,315i13,Matt-SW,2,Sun Apr 5 22:18:01 2015 UTC,Thanks!
civbeyondearth,315i13,Galgus,3,Sun Apr 5 22:34:53 2015 UTC,"One thing about the game that makes me indifferent to scouting across seas at least is a lack of natural wonders   I see what you mean, but I find just spamming Explorers out to find Expeditions and resource pods is quite a worthwhile reason. Managed to get three Affinity points within about 10 turns with Progenitor ruins expeditions."
civbeyondearth,315i13,wolfdreams01,3,Thu Apr 2 14:23:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not much of a modder, but a long time ago I put together a list of Natural Wonder ideas, with affinity-aligned ways to develop them.  This development would both help them scale later in the game and give some affinity flavor to how your civilization uses them.  This is the thread, but to briefly summarize them in their base forms:  Shard Mountain: A huge mountain rich in valuable ores, particularly known for its massive Floatstone deposits. Large flying islands of rock hover beside it, giving it its name.  The Scar of Erebus: A huge and unfathomably deep chasm in the planet with grants easy access to the planet's subterranean depths. Stange lifeforms not seen on the surface can be found there.  The Gaiawell: A massive pool of Xenomass that appears to create incredibly fertile ground, if the lush growth around it is any indication.  Bilumin Cavern: A vast hollow in the earth where massive Firaxite deposits glow beautifully in a sparking display. It gains its name from a mysterious blue Firaxite variant not seen anywhere else. Aliens seem to grow docile near it, and our explorers report a strange calming feeling in its presence.  The Forsaken City: The largest Progenitor Ruin on the planet, resembling a large city in its scale with many levels that continue underground."
civbeyondearth,315i13,Galgus,2,Fri Apr 3 00:05:58 2015 UTC,I think it would be awesome if Natural Wonders each had quests associated with them which would trigger as soon as the Wonder was in your Civilization's territory.

This wouldn't be so bad if not for the fact that Japan were so damn powerful compared to other factions, especially France and Italy.  So rather than leave it random we ended up rolling a dice and using that to ""randomly"" decide instead."

I'm imagining an (almost?) all-ocean empire. Strategics might require a city or two inland.  EDIT: So, I tried loading up a game with it. First thing I noticed is that my coastal capital isn't considered a coastal city. Weird. Everything is either land or ocean, no coast. Is that going to mess with city connections for coastal/oceanic cities?  Anyway... right out of the gate, I throw a colonist in the water. Okay, that works. I found a city. Turns out that in the middle of the ocean, even with the city bonuses and a coral tile, it's not enough to make the city grow from 1 population. Stagnation right off the bat. That's a real pain.  Next, I try putting a marine in the water. Hey, they're marines, right? Surely they'll be able to attack? Nope. They embark. So much for that.  I really want to play a full game, but it's still a bit rough around the edges, and for some reason, spawning the new AIs is really slow. More than anything, I want to see a huge variety of water tiles, making the ocean as detailed as the land and giving you more strategic options.  So far, great work! Keep it up and I look forward to playing it more."

They're honestly not really worth it though. The AI gets these bonuses as well and some of them (a free virtue for example) are absurdly overpowered.
civbeyondearth,30w0c1,El_Barto_227,2,Tue Mar 31 21:05:07 2015 UTC,How is the free virtue overpowered? it's only a few turns worth of cullture.(Legit question here)

civbeyondearth,30w0c1,fernando_69,6,Wed Apr 1 14:48:59 2015 UTC,"I started with Pioneering and Pioneers, AU. 3 cities by turn 30, and 7 outposts+cities before turn 80. I win on turn 236 with 9 cities.  EDIT: And... this is turn 108, 1 turn after taking KP's capital. Solidly in the lead and on track for the win. Now I can turtle up and focus on nothing but science and leveling affinity.  This was a prosperity start for the free colonist (so I could have 3 cities up and running on turn 30), straight down to +7 health, and then into industry to pick up +1 energy for basic resources and the interest bonus. Now, I'm headed back to prosperity to pick up hands never idle and eudaimonia. To make the most of the interest bonus, I have spies siphon energy for a while to pump up my bank to ~1000, though right now I'm a bit short because it's the end of the war. That will fix itself in 2 turns.  Clinic (+1 health), trade depot (+1 production, hate that I can't hard buy them anymore), pharmalab (+1 health), cytonursery is the build order for new cities. The established cities pump out the troops (including the trade convoys for science and culture) and the rest of the buildings (recycler, laboratory, thorium reactor). All new cities get a ranger and a worker or two, as well as roads right away, then mines, plantations/farms, and finally academies. I aim to hit +1 science on farms and build 20 academies in the mid-game.  I should also excavate that skeleton. I might get a free level of affinity (more often an alien unit/progenitor ruins are much better/the new scanner for artifacts is also OP/all your ruin are belong to us), but I've been pressed on other things. Haven't touched the satellite either. Early game I go for resource pods over excavations because they have more immediate benefit to bootstrapping. Now, I'll be spreading those troops in a perimeter and on my one chokepoint, then shoring it up gradually.  EDIT 2: 20 turns later, on turn 128, after stabilizing (pay no mind to the -40 energy; I usually run a deficit from here on out and use spying to finance it). I'm 4 affinity levels behind 2nd place, but I have 28 more science per turn. I've more than doubled it, and I'm ahead of the turn count, at 148 beakers and rapidly rising. I've built 16 of my 20 academies. When I finish, I'll focus back on farming/picking up Artificial Evolution for +1 science on farms.  I'll pick up another affinity level in 5 turns, and another in 11 turns after that. I'm only 2 levels behind Hutama, my neighbor, so I don't think he'll attack. I'm using 2 spies to steal tech for a couple of cycles to hopefully help close the gap. The alien skeleton gave me a raptor bug which got sacked for gold, but I'm going to give the other one a try.  I think Biochemistry is long overdue. I got distracted, and it's only 2 turns away. Maybe defense perimeters and rocket batteries, too. This is also the stage where I'll build a real navy (picked up +2 naval unit movement during the war). It's complicated by the fact that only half of my cities are coastal this game. There's also a small, but stubborn Polystralian city to my east preventing me from moving naval units around my full coastline.  Just for fun, here's two turns later. Turn 130, 8 cities, 22 health, 163 beakers. Eudaimonia! This is normally the point where I'd launch yet another round of cities, but I think I'm going to stick to 8 this game unless I start slipping in score. I tend to wind up with 11-13 in most games.  EDIT 3: Turn 162, 32 turns later and I've taken care of the energy problem. I also took time to grab Artificial Evolution, which is a really painful delay in Purity. Luckily, I got the free tech and used it to get a bit closer. Farms are +1 energy and +1 science. I built a handful of generators in the northern wastes, grabbed the synergy bonus in industry for +10% energy in every city, and built biofuel plants and floatstone quarries everywhere.  I'm also building holomatrix units to pump culture, and I've more than doubled it since turn 130. I'm making my first foray into the knowledge tree. That +10% science is really nice. 54 more science per turn and I'll be at double the turn count. I'm still 3 affinity levels behind Elodie (my 9 to her 12), but I'm doing what I can. After all, I did pick up 5 affinity levels in 32 turns, plus a spare level in harmony. There's a level 10 turns away, and 3 more levels, each 18 turns away. I've moved into stealing science at this point, but I just lost a spy in Le Coeur. Perhaps I should have expanded more after all. I'm running out of room to build stuff. On the bright side, I'm 128 beakers/turn ahead of Elodie.  I have a slight kraken problem, and not a strong enough navy to handle it. I need the upgrade to destroyers and the extra range. 23 health, 270 beakers, 92 culture, no energy deficit, and 1200+ in the bank.   That's it for tonight, because I need sleep. I'll finish the game after I rejoin the world. Leave me comments about what I should do. Should I throw out a mini civilization to my north with 3 new cities? Should I take over Saira and put an extra city to the west? Should I try for a Contact victory or stick to Purity? How would you close the affinity gap or prevent it in the first place?  EDIT 4: Turn 187, 25 turns later. I've decided that the best way to make maximal use of my empire is to have more workers actually working the tiles. I've switched to a food focus and pumped up the population, which is still dragging the science upward with it. I'm at 349 beakers which means I only have 25 beakers to go until double the turn count. Boosting the population had the side effect of unlocking the second trade route for each city, so I've put all my internal trade routes to Magan and Mandira, and used a couple external ones for energy.  I've finally hit 12 affinity, but I'm still 3 behind Elodie, who's at 15 now. However, I've researched communications and orbital networks, hoisted a lasercom satellite, and I'm going for nanotechnology now to build my exodus gate. I'm the only one with any victory condition progress, so that's a nice surprise.  Also, I've decided to take Saira. KP tried sending a colonist south, and I couldn't have that happening. Shortly after, I asked for peace and added in open borders for them, which allowed me to move my troops up. I could use another city, and then I can stop worrying about defending that side so heavily. That will let me focus on keeping Polystralia in line. They picked up a bunch of affinity levels out of nowhere are are currently at 14. What the...? At least my kraken problem is taken care of, which is keeping Bongani from stagnating.  EDIT 5: Turn 195. 8 turns later and I've decisively taken Saira and they've agreed to peace. I turned down their offer of another city, because I don't want the maintenance headache. I also took some science per turn and their petroleum. I now have a functional navy, LEV tanks, and battlesuits. I've researched nanotechnology for the exodus gate, and I'm 4 turns away from affinity 13, at which point I'll build it and begin the forcible resettlement procedure.  EDIT 6: It's still only turn 200, but I'm 15 turns from an Exodus Gate. I've dispersed my troops again, and I'm clearing an island to the north for establishing human settlements, as well as working my way down the western peninsula below Zuberi. My navy is nearly finished, and I've also picked up level 14 in purity, which upgraded my lancers to dragoons. Those will be spread in the ocean intermixed with destroyers as part of my border control strategy. A tacnet hub is also in place up north between Xirsi and the future island home of my imported humans. Trade routes are being redirected to Magan to speed things up. This will save about 4 turns right now. During the next 15 turns, I'll have workers upgrade my road infrastructure to magrails and put magrails on the island to speed up the resettlement procedure.   EDIT 7: Turn 214 and I've beaten Elodie to an operational Exodus Gate. I finished the magrails on the mainland and a phasal transporter to the northern island. Magrails on the island are underway. I should have prioritized that a bit more. My first human settler is on the island. They go via magrail to Jenali and phasal transporter to the island in one move. I've also thrown up tacnet hubs along my borders and chokepoints, better spread out my navy, and finished clearing the island. Tacnet hubs are my favorite orbital unit (followed by holomatrix) as they require no petroleum or upkeep and they build in 1-2 turns. Every city is getting rocket batteries, command centers, and node banks.   The energy budget is well in hand, with an overall upward trend despite the negative per turn income (only -10). I have 1700+ energy in the bank and am well prepared to fight any incoming troops. Being in the end game, science has taken a backseat to production and energy, but it continues to rise (currently 411 beakers). Saira finally came out of unrest and joined the empire, which means my health has taken a beating and is down to a mere 10.  I am one turn ahead of schedule in the resettlement procedure and 166 points in the lead. I expect a hefty quarterly bonus for timely completion. I built Master Control, Panopticon, and Stellar Codex because I had nothing else to do (Nanothermite will finish in 9 turns). The northern island has more than adequate space to host my new earthling civilization by itself and it is far from enemies, simplifying logistics and defense. I have 15 affinity levels in purity, 5 in supremacy, and 1 in harmony. I'm aiming for a turn 234-239 win."
civbeyondearth,30w0c1,Gurloes,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:51:28 2015 UTC,"Since the last post was too long, I'm picking it up in this one:  Turn 233, Elodie finally builds her Exodus Gate. In the meantime, I've put out orbital lasers covering all the major regions, including the sea entrance to my northern island and the gate itself. I've already got 18 settled and 2 more out. My phasal transporter stopped working with 5 turns left on its life, so I purchase one.   I'm doing great in the cash department, because I've spammed solar collectors: +93 energy/turn. I've run out of things to build and all cities have been switched to industrial development. Elodie has one lonely dreadnought poking around, but no one is so much as blinking in my general direction. I politely ignore the condemnations and continue to enjoy my empire flourishing: I am level 15 in purity, 8 in supremacy, and 7 in harmony. Next turn I'll pick up another level in supremacy. I have 44 health and 595 science, and I may yet hit 600 before the game is out.   One turn later, on turn 234, I hit 600 beakers. I am well past double the turn count. I have also broken my previous record of 550 beakers by turn 240.  I win on turn 236, with 606 beakers and a score of 996. So close to 1000. It is only this turn that I am given the quest to not have my trade routes attacked by aliens, despite having built an ultrasonic fence around 150 turns back. 42 health, +100 energy (over 3500 in the bank), +180 culture. I have 9 cities, 139 population, and a military that I won't even bother counting out. I am level 15 in purity, 9 in supremacy, and 8 in harmony.  Thanks for watching!"

Even on the highest difficulty the game just meanders and nothing much happens and then you win. I've won 3 times in it so far, and every time I had no idea I was even closing in on a victory condition. I'm just poking around, upgrading my fleet, and all the sudden the planet I just took over hands me a victory for some condition I was unaware of.   There's no real tension or possibility of losing. Just buy things, fly around with your fleet, upgrade it however you want, and then eventually you win.

Sadly I'm never going to get them all because I've finished all the other achievements but still need 100 aliens killed, 30 nests and SEVEN HUNDRED TILES purchased.

civbeyondearth,30o9c2,cityspammonkey,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:36:10 2015 UTC,Espionage just straight up doesn't work on longer game speeds.  It seems that intrigue builds at the same rate regardless of game speed.

civbeyondearth,30nuei,PleaseTrade,9,Sun Mar 29 02:11:39 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen any stats over how many sold copies, but a quick glance at the steam statistics does give you an idea; CIV:V has around 10 times as many players at the moment than CIV:BE, however, CIV:V has only 5 times as many reviews on steam than BE. All I can gather from this is that BE might have pretty decent sale figures, though not very active players.  To add my personal opinion, I don't really care much for BE, I miss the historical references far to much, and aesthetically it Really does not work for me (glad it does for you though!). Some things I really do like; the tech web, the new spy system, and the quests."
civbeyondearth,30nuei,drkewl,4,Sun Mar 29 02:35:16 2015 UTC,"I stopped playing Civ back at Civ III/Alpha Centauri and then I got back into the series when Civ: BE came out, because I played a few LAN games with friends and it reminded me of AC. I feel that it's been well worth my money, as I'm under a dollar an hour by now and I'm not even an especially heavy player.  I've also played a bit of Endless Legend recently and found the unit customization much more reminiscent of AC. Kinda wish they would differentiate the faction units a bit more and rework the unit customization for Civ: BE.   The patches have been a source of constant discussion as our favorite strategies get nerfed (invincible explorers funding your empire by wiping out alien nests! trade routes, twice now! and wonders!) and we have to rework them, though I expect it to stabilize a bit in the future. Also, in MP the AIs are much less obnoxious and gripey, which is nice, but it would be cool if there was some real change to their play style rather than just giving them huge bonuses (normally play Soyuz or Apollo SP, Gemini for LAN games). SP is pretty much practice runs for our LAN games (550 beakers by turn 240? Why thank you!).   The AI still makes stupid strategic resource purchases early on, and the diplomacy is pretty shallow, without a lot of variation or haggling room. In contrast, diplomacy with some depth is something I'm enjoying about Endless Legend.   Examples: KP always asks for a cooperation agreement, so sell them your resources. Too many things require cooperation agreements, but they're pretty rare (and rarely accept) if you're not playing a trade-heavy game--which is now much harder, round 2. Brasilia is a good partner to trade strategics with. No amount of favors will make PAC go to war against someone else for you, so don't bother. Never give anyone open borders unless they're across the map from you. And so on.   The new bonuses from Starships are a whole other kettle of overpowered trout.  TL;DR: My friends played Civ: IV and Civ: V (which I skipped), but as a group, we pretty much stick to playing Civ: BE right now. I gripe a lot, but I'm only griping because it's been entertaining enough to hold my attention for this long (and in the hopes that maybe things get tweaked).  /yes we are silly minmaxmonkeys sometimes"
civbeyondearth,30nuei,cityspammonkey,2,Sun Mar 29 04:24:41 2015 UTC,Glad you enjoy it too. Wish my friends would pick it up!

civbeyondearth,30nuei,dnlhl,2,Sun Mar 29 07:27:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is something that I guess I didn't realize as much as I could have. The historical element is an absolutely massive draw for a lot of people. Until yours, and a few others comments, I didn't realize how relatively unimportant the historical elements were for me in regards to my enjoyment of the series.  I love empire building, researching advances, and spreading my empire. I think the novelty of BE has a bit more draw for me in that regard while shedding the linear timeline of the previous civ series.  Thanks for the polite response!"
civbeyondearth,30nuei,monkwren,7,Mon Mar 30 17:00:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like one good DLC could save the game for me, so I hope the sales were good enough to justify one. I'd normally be against buying a DLC to turn a bad game into a good one, but as a SMAC fan, I was so excited when CIV:BE was announced, and I still really want to play a modern game that's as good as SMAC."
civbeyondearth,30nuei,dnlhl,3,Mon Mar 30 23:28:19 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I feel. A decent content-filler DLC would be perfect. I really like the three different affinities, their general goals, and how the units look. More research, and something to differentiate your empires (not religion/ideologies, but similar) further, and this would be my favourite game."
civbeyondearth,30nuei,monkwren,2,Sun Mar 29 11:44:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's also worth recalling that Civ5 was a real clunker until the DLCs came out, too - I refused to play it in favor of Civ4 for literally years until a friend convinced me to try it with G+K and BNW. Now I love Civ5, and while BE certainly has some flaws, it's still getting patched, and DLC could make some huge differences (especially by adding more factions)."

civbeyondearth,30nuei,maytagem,3,Mon Apr 13 19:29:14 2015 UTC,"I almost got it at launch but I realized that it would be very buggy and incomplete so I couldn't justify paying $50 for it. I did however, watch it like a hawk for sales. It dropped to $25 recently, so I snatched it up. It definitely needs more content (which will come in time), but I love it for what it currently is. I'm sure that after I do all the victory quests then it'll get a bit repetitive, but when that happens I can either turn to mods (which there aren't very many for BE, quite yet) or I can return to Civ V for a while."
civbeyondearth,30nuei,echolog,0,Tue Apr 14 16:28:13 2015 UTC,"Will more content come in time? That's what I worry about. I think it would be fantastic but I haven't heard anything about the future of BE.  Starships is a super shitty cash grab for a mobile audience. I have zero interest in it, and I'm scared if that sells poorly then they won't want to do a proper expansion."
civbeyondearth,30nuei,ericd7,2,Sun Mar 29 08:20:35 2015 UTC,"Will more content come in time?   If their past release pattern is any indication, then yes. There's already a map pack DLC out for BE. They aren't just going to let it die. That would be a terrible decision. They'll give it the same treatment as Civ V.  I wasn't discussing Starships, but since you brought it up...yes, I think anyone who has played it would agree with you. Why are you afraid that Starships success will effect BE?? Starships is not content for BE, it's just a casual game they made for a cheap price that has interconnectivity with BE for people who like that sort of thing. It's asinine to think that they will let Starships' sales color their regard for BE. They aren't even the same genre of game."
civbeyondearth,30nuei,cityspammonkey,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:23:04 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how you examine the issue, and no need to be dismissive!  They aren't the same genre of game but as a lot of people mention a huge draw for people is the historical element. Starships shares the same ""brand"" as beyond earth, set with the same affinities in the same kind of universe. I could see them looking at the sales as a general measure of receptivity to the setting, that is to say deviating away from the standard civ formula.  And I mean, cheap mobile game sure but its still a strategy game.  http://sandboxgamesdb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Starships-Screenshot.jpg  Anyways, perhaps I think about it too much. Thanks for the comment."
civbeyondearth,30nuei,bmhadoken,9,Tue Mar 31 00:20:27 2015 UTC,"BE sold amazingly well. There are multiple posts on the subject on this sub. The thing is that no one plays it anymore, because it's a mediocre to poor experience"
civbeyondearth,30nuei,Taivasvaeltaja,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:57:46 2015 UTC,"Eh, I enjoyed it. I find there is more freedom, when compared to the historical progression of previous civ games. But I do 100% understand the lack of polish and depth in some areas compared to Civ5."
civbeyondearth,30nuei,Matt-SW,2,Sun Mar 29 02:43:12 2015 UTC,"All of my friends who play Civ V bought it, and several of us still play from time to time. It's a breath of fresh air if nothing else!"

For me it's the historical setting that I find more interesting, seeing the progression of units from archers all the way through to X-Com squads is really satisfying."
civbeyondearth,30ekfr,DarZhubal,26,Thu Mar 26 19:07:43 2015 UTC,Use the 'ol fortify while Aliens suicide into your soldiers trick.
civbeyondearth,30ekfr,Galgus,17,Thu Mar 26 20:23:50 2015 UTC,"Gun for Scavenging from the Might virtue tree, pop some rangers just inside an ultrasonic fence and go nuts. You'll get a massive boost to science from all the bugs you've killed, and eventually you'll whittle down the aliens enough to quickly pop the nests with a carefully deployed rover. Prioritise Affinity techs while bug swatting. Finally, once the nests are cleared, set a colonist down to control the Xenomass.  End result: you have veteran ranged infantry, a solid boost to your Affinity level and a city poised for a population boom once you can pop down some Xenomass wells, which should help to offset your delayed expansion somewhat."
civbeyondearth,30ekfr,eddie_pls,2,Fri Mar 27 07:19:23 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this, although i would do it with naval units (on the EAST side away from the krakens), since you will need veteran naval troops more than rangers on that map imo. You can also build a second city on the mountain on the far east (4 tiles away), if you felt like expanding earlier. It would be able to work that coral tile, and provide some more support vs the aliens. after securing your island and leveling up some boats, you could then try to escort something to the island to the west/possibly fight the kraken even."
civbeyondearth,30ekfr,Conc1ave,2,Fri Mar 27 15:18:36 2015 UTC,"My only concern there is that ships are a much larger investment than rangers when OP only has one city. Otherwise, totally; he could even try the same tactic I mentioned, keep his ships inside the fence and whittle down the kraken, opening up the west much earlier."
civbeyondearth,30ekfr,eddie_pls,11,Fri Mar 27 19:00:14 2015 UTC,"I would say that this is actually an incredibly good start -- when you spawn that close to that many alien nests, you need to capitalize on them and destroy them as soon as you possibly can. Nests = wild zones. Wild zones = best terrain in the game."
civbeyondearth,30ekfr,larknok1,6,Thu Mar 26 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"When aliens strike like this, in the early game you have to advance one square at a time holding your ground as you beat them back.  I have fought off worse before from more then just the 2 nests it looks like you have.  First tip, don't fortify in miasma if it harms your soldiers."
civbeyondearth,30ekfr,Drak_is_Right,4,Fri Mar 27 04:04:02 2015 UTC,"You could always grab scavenging from the might tree to boost your science significantly, turtle up and go for fast affinity levels..."

civbeyondearth,30ekfr,Galgus,3,Thu Mar 26 22:28:37 2015 UTC,Just leave the alien nest in your territory for a few turns and you tame them. You can use these aliens as explorers.  Edit: sauce: http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Alien_nest_%28CivBE%29

civbeyondearth,30ekfr,runetrantor,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:14:35 2015 UTC,"Play the higher difficulty levels. I (practically without fail) get ARC as one neighbor and Franco-Iberia or African Union as the other, usually ~9 tiles or so away. I hate ARC with a fiery burning passion, so I almost always try to run them over early in the game.   I've also taken to turning off staggered starts just so I can reroll on turn 2 if I get an incredibly obnoxious position without having to find it out after 30 turns (as I did in the game below, which had a turn 2 colonist for me). The game will kick you off a tile to drop an AI on it, even if you're on the tile with a colonist settling next turn. That can really ruin a promising lead as you take time to deal with it. On Apollo, they come with all this junk. My exploder and armor were moved off their tiles to make room for the new AI."
civbeyondearth,30ekfr,cityspammonkey,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:08:32 2015 UTC,"Difficulty levels have nothing to do with it, I played the equivalent of Prince, and I had Koslov literally drop 6 tiles from my city (We each had our 3 workable range not overlapping).  Luckily he landed on a peninsula so I locked him in.  I always get neighbors, too close for my tastes. Some were saying it's not possible, that the game is coded to have a minimum distance from your spawn to land the others, but I guess that code line is being lazy."

No seriously - get as peaceful with them as you can, try to get a nest inside your borders, and they'll eventually ally you. Then you have a huge natural army protecting you while you can move your settlers, explorers, and other units out and across the map.  Alternately, rush a Fence so you can use your military for offence, and get a few of the Might Virtues - especially if you can get Scavenging - Science galore!"

civbeyondearth,3041y9,DefiantMars,2,Tue Mar 24 08:28:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's the same in BE but I got this from the civ wiki   Fortification  Many units have the ability to fortify. This means that the unit ""digs in"" and creates defensive works in its current location. This gives the unit a 40% defensive bonus, making it much tougher to kill. However, fortifications are strictly defensive: if the unit moves or attacks, the fortifications are destroyed. While fortified, a unit will not perform any action, and will heal damage. It will remain inactive until you manually activate it by clicking on the unit.  Fortifying requires available MPs, but does not consumes them! That means that a unit may not fortify if it has already exhausted all MPs for the round; but on the other hand, if it has already fortified earlier in the round, and the battle situation changes before its end, it may still perform another action before the end of the round."
civbeyondearth,300rgv,Eldgrim,11,Mon Mar 23 15:38:05 2015 UTC,They somehow fixed trade routes by breaking it in a totally different way.

Why are trade routes even in this game? Has anyone ever found them fun? What do they add to the experience that Beyond Earth is supposed to bring? I should be focusing on aliens and foreign geology and affinities, not convoys. I hope they go back to the drawing board for the expansion."
civbeyondearth,300rgv,jeremyhoffman,2,Mon Mar 23 21:20:18 2015 UTC,I miss them in their form from earlier Civ games when they were just units that could get you money. Now they're a necessary city building that doesn't work like any other building. It doesn't ruin the game for me but I still haven't figured out how to cancel the route and make a new one at will.
civbeyondearth,300rgv,lordhadri,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:24:16 2015 UTC,"In Civ 5, and I assume in BE as well, you can't cancel a trade route, you have to wait until the assignment expires. After this patch, it seems like trade routes default to auto-renew, so you'll have to uncheck the auto-renew button or go into the trade route screen (by hitting the + button to the left of the bar at the bottom that has buttons for promotions, quests, espionage, etc.)"
civbeyondearth,300rgv,jeremyhoffman,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:56:54 2015 UTC,"Now that we don't get as many, I enjoy them. I don't even let them autorenew, since I like the flexibility of being able to periodically change up my priorities, converging trade units on a city building a wonder (or an army), dispersing them among the other nations when I'd rather get cash and science."

From making it decision and action oriented rather than tech based, to adding national wonders for each affinity, reskins, and a lot more.   I'd also like to alter health and add happiness back into the mix. I'd like to make both of them local with happiness only being global for the purpose of passing laws. (A system similar to social policies, but different in many ways).  Here is a link to an idea thread I had a while back.

I don't keep a unit in a city at all unless it has a reasonable threat of being attacked. The city itself, with appropriate defense improvements, is quite capable of repelling small to mid range invasions. I usually have a tech edge, so that helps.  All that said, I still wish I could build Forts or Citadels in BE."

civbeyondearth,2zx8q7,Mr_Industrial,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:59:02 2015 UTC,"Tacnet hubs are really great on borders/chokepoints, or for invading people. Even if you're low on petroleum, you can always find someone to trade with for it, and it's often worth it. If you plan to use a lot of satellites, make sure to settle a good oil city or two. Throw one up over or just outside of their city when you attack it. I also like sending a small fleet of workers in to build war roads so I can funnel reinforcements directly to the battle/for garrison duty as I conquer more cities. Plus, when you take their city, it's a couple turns away from having a city connection already! Also, if you get in the habit of building a ring road for your civ, you can settle new cities next to it and have a city connection right away."
civbeyondearth,2zx8q7,cityspammonkey,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:08:56 2015 UTC,"Nodes are nice if you have a city next to a neighbor (if you're in a heavily settled area, this is pretty much always) and you want to take their city. You can rotate and heal up your troops nicely and lets you pound on your enemy without needing to spend so much time producing new units or spending your unit upgrades on healing."
civbeyondearth,2zx8q7,cityspammonkey,5,Tue Mar 31 02:07:57 2015 UTC,"I usually keep 1 gunner or a few planes stationed at my furthermost cities, or any city sharing borders with someone who hates me. To be honest that happens pretty often since I usually tell them to piss off when they tell me to stop expanding/excavating near them. But I find that late-game that army is helpful for blitzing my neighbors when they start working on their victory wonders,"
civbeyondearth,2zx8q7,bmhadoken,4,Sun Mar 22 19:43:04 2015 UTC,I usually keep one gunner and one airplane in each city.  The airplane is good for softening up units before they get within your city's attack range and is also useful to intercept air strikes.
civbeyondearth,2zx8q7,wolfdreams01,2,Mon Mar 23 02:25:24 2015 UTC,"One ranger/gunner/etc. and one melee unit for me (later the units move towards the borders of the civ). The rangers are one of the first units I build, putting 1 in each city for garrison (or on a nearby hill), because the early game cities aren't strong enough to repel a real invasion (which happens on higher difficulty if you don't keep a garrison). Late game when the other players start using tacjets, I might build one for each city too, but not always. Internal cities like my capital often have no active garrison, because I've formed a perimeter around my civ."
civbeyondearth,2zx8q7,cityspammonkey,3,Tue Mar 31 02:17:27 2015 UTC,"My general rule of thumb for minimum defense playing on Gemini and Soyuz is a ratio of three units for every city in the colony, with air units consisting of one-third total. This excludes naval assets which operate largely independently and typically include their own air defense. Ground units are generally evenly split between Soldiers and Rangers supporting each other with two or three Combat Rovers maintained for patrol, flanking, and pursuit. Units are kept in groups of two to avoid unit congestion but are never more than three turns away from another group to ensure timely response to threats. Border areas where I anticipate potential conflict are covered by invaluable TacNet Hubs as soon as possible. I rarely construct Artillery, preferring Rangers behind Soldiers for ranged attacks.  Playing a small and tall colony I find this ratio works well to deter most neighbors from aggression however requires a defensive mindset with regards city placement, road and magrail prioritization, and orbital planning. Units are not necessarily kept in or around cities however they occasionally are if there are no better defensive locations nearby.  If my colony borders a particularly aggressive neighbor, or a neighbor is more inclined to backstab (Koslov, Fielding, Hutama), I will construct additional Rangers and Rovers and keep them in reserve should I need to launch a counter-offensive although this force is a drain on Energy and as such is typically bought once it is needed rather than built in preparation."

Before the patch Ectogenesis Pod and Spy Agency were my early priorities, with Promethean and Memetwork mid-game priorities no matter what Affinity I was pursuing. Playing small--less than 4 cities--most of those Wonders' food and health benefits can be critical towards staying competitive. For low-Affinity playthroughs (max level 3 all Affinities) Precog Project and Drone Sphere became critical for their territorial defense and unit healing benefits.  All other Wonders were largely situational, however there were none I would not make an attempt for if the tech was in easy reach, a city had completed most buildings, and I had a reasonable chance of completing the Wonder. Of those situational Wonders I particularly liked grabbing the Stellar Codex, Panopticon, Crawler, Master Control (Supremacy), and Gene Vault (Purity) though, mostly for their defense and production benefits."
civbeyondearth,2zx8q7,Catch_66,2,Mon Mar 23 21:45:00 2015 UTC,When I play Purity I usually go with one gunner in a city because they get the bonus in the city and extra range if they haven't moved.

If I had the option to refund a game within 24 hours on steam I would have.  The game is not finished.  I feel like the company's model is to make the game actually functional and fun only after several expansions (which is how I feel about Civ V, before Brave New World it was not good).   Starships looks kinds fun, reminds me of old Sid Meier's Ace Patrol but,  Civ BE is in a bad way."

civbeyondearth,2zpvud,Yulong,8,Fri Mar 20 20:15:12 2015 UTC,"Possible, but I doubt it. With the trade route nerfs, that would be a very mediocre bonus. Your capital usually hits 10 pretty quickly and hits 27 very late, so it's essentially a +1 trade route benefit."
civbeyondearth,2zpvud,Yulong,5,Fri Mar 20 20:31:22 2015 UTC,"Don't underestimate the power of that early +2 trade routes. You start laboratory for the free pioneering, rush a trade depot, and suddenly you have the trade route flexibility to run two internals to your second and third, and placate a particular neighbor while banking energy, or run a route to a delicious culture station. It's a very fair and flexible bonus in my opinion that falls off late.  It's just that AU makes most sponsor bonuses look silly haha."

Caveat, this is all from single player (but Soyuz/Apollo), I don't have 4+ continuous hours at a time to play multiplayer, nor the desire:   Prosperity is just too good to pass up as a first tree. Free colonist by T25. I usually compete the first tier, then go to +7 health, +prod for basics, and +health for basics before touching another tree.  Might is probably viable too if you go heavy alien genocide (for +science), but still not as good.  Knowledge isn't useful enough early game. With those health boosts and the fairly minor negative health penalties, REX is the name of the game. Free worker from gene vault and settler clans are big boosts.   You'll probably get a DOW from your neighbor from REX, so build roads and get at least lvl 2 affinity."
civbeyondearth,2zr875,BobbleBobble,3,Sat Mar 21 04:01:58 2015 UTC,"What does REX stand for?  To add onto this, Prosperity is definitely an amazing tree, and if you're a Terrascape fanatic, make sure you get Ecoscaping at the very bottom - if you can afford it, you can turn all your useless tiles into god-tiles that produce massive amounts of culture, food, and production.  Industry is also an excellent tree - Commoditization gets you +1 energy from basic resources, which really adds up over time, and Alternative Markets gets you +6 energy per station tier.  So a station that is Tier 3 will be producing 18 energy.  Standardized Architecture is unbelievably useful if you're going wide (+25% production for buildings already in the capital), Scalable Infrastructure gets you +15% production for wonders, and Liquidity makes it a whole lot easier to make emergency purchases in wartime, with -20% unit purchase cost.  And then there's Magnasanti, which is just beautiful: +.2 Health per building.  Between Industry and Prosperity, you will likely be rolling in cash and be so unbelievably healthy that you can crap Manufactories (there's an Industry virtue that makes them +5 Production, incidentally) without any penalties at all."

I'm a bit underwhelmed by terrascapes, they take forever to build and by the time you can actually get a critical mass, straight farms are arguably better (+1 food/production/energy/science from techs)   Depends.  Terrascapes are unlocked at Terraforming - if you have a bunch of workers already, you'd be surprised by how quickly you can terraform a decent chunk of your civilization, especially with the worker bonus from Prosperity.  In particular they're excellent on desert tiles, which are largely useless outside of generators - if you have a Vivarium it still nets you an extra food on the Terrascaped tiles.  Also they look really good, but that's not really important.   Industry definitely gives Knowledge a run for its money as best 2nd tree, but money is never a problem in BE (covert ops print cash, no city states to spend it on, few buildings and they're cheap)... the +science and +culture as well as discounts in the knowledge tree are just too good.   Funnily enough, I typically use my covert ops to steal science rather than energy.  Personally, I think the Knowledge tree is very useful, but it's almost always a secondary choice for me.  Might also has plenty of uses even if you're not a warmonger - ARC and their covert ops particularly benefit from one of the middle virtues.  My preference is to set up new cities as quickly as humanly possible - if I can, I immediately purchase a Recycler, Thorium Reactor, Clinic, Relic, and Autoplant, Vivarium if it's on a desert or really needs extra food.  And I always like to keep cash on hand for if something stupid happens... like the PAC going from ""friendly"" to ""hate my guts"" out of absolutely nowhere.  One of my cities, over one turn, went from a frontier colony to a fortress."

I haven't done the math, but my general impression is that steal science (when successful) typically yields about half to two thirds a turn's worth of science, whereas energy usually yields 10x or more my GPT (which makes it proportionally better IMO).   Might also has plenty of uses even if you're not a warmonger - ARC and their covert ops particularly benefit from one of the middle virtues, but they're buried so deep it doesn't feel worth it.   Meh, I just don't see it.  Maybe it's a balance thing, but I feel that AI intrigue falls way too quickly to make the +40% matter.  The best non-warmongering Might virtues are the +affinity ones."

Oh sure, it was just the one that I thought of off the top of my head.  There's also Scavenging and Survivalism, both very handy when dealing with aliens, and they're pretty early in the tree, and Military-Industrial Complex is good to have on hand anyway.  None of them are must-haves, obviously, but they still have uses outside of warmonger games.  And of course, in a warmonger game the Might tree is basically a necessity."

For more on precisely what that is -- check out 9:09 of the first video in my PAC Supremacy Let's Play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwHxtJLrrXQ     I honestly don't get why people like Prosperity as an opener so much. In BE, you can't afford to jump around from one tree to another at the highest level play (except when combining with Knowledge) -- so a Prosperity opener forces you into Prosperity only. Prosperity offers you a bunch of interesting things, but no promise of science, armies, or late-game payout to speak of.     As far as beating the AI consistently on Apollo goes -- you need to militarize and you need to militarize early. If you don't rush your closest neighbor by Affinity level 2 (with gunners) or by Affinity level 3 (with artillery) -- it's basically over. Even if you do -- if you're  not Supremacy or you didn't go Knowledge -- you'll fall so far behind in the science-rush that your military victory won't even matter.      Don't let a free settler on turn 25 convince you that Prosperity is the best. Plan for late game victories with science and culture (Knowledge) and secure that future with military prowess (Might).     As far as playing your affinity goes -- play to your Affinity's weakness and try to compensate. For Purity -- that means do whatever you can to get science from wherever you can. For Supremacy -- that means do whatever you can to get food from wherever you can. For Harmony -- that means secure a military advantage early as your units will lose out in a fair and equal fight."

If you settle a city 8 tiles from an opponent's capital and 10 from yours, it'll set them off.

But in the game I'm playing on a real world map, my capital is on the Arabian peninsula, shaka's capital is in South Africa, and he got pissed when I expanded AWAY from him to the northeast, where he had no cities.  My capital is around 40 tiles away from his.  So maybe it depends on the civ in question as well.  Shaka is a bit... temperamental, after all.  I always find it funny when Venice gets pissed too.  I think they're just envious of anyone who can expand."

Now imagine a dozen workers all trying to ""route to"" within five tiles of each other.

That, and once you build terrascaping, that's all the workers want to build.  When I get to the point I have 50 or 60 workers, I'm not taking the time to control them all individually - I usually have a few that I work with to build what I immediately need and leave the rest to themselves.

It's a great game for me to play while doing other things, since you can enjoy it quite a bit while only giving it a fraction of your attention. It's not the best ""port"" though. No real fullscreen or resolution options. A lot of mechanics don't really scale into ""late game"" (like the marketplace...gets really annoying to click 100 times to sell off un-needed resources) so it really feels like it's not meant to be complex."
civbeyondearth,2zbvbn,corg,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:33:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like to think of it as Civ-lite, with some tactical elements.  If you're looking for a 2 hour quick game on the the patio, this is great for that.  It's basically like a higher-end tablet game, so I think the pricing is appropriate."
civbeyondearth,2zbvbn,Darthkill,-3,Wed Mar 18 00:03:00 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend it  Its funny though as I feel starships could have worked quite well as a 2-3 hour game amongst friends if designed around it. but its terrible.

civbeyondearth,2zaclc,Galgus,10,Mon Mar 16 22:56:40 2015 UTC,"Partially due to character limits and partially for organization, I'll just post new quest ideas here, leaving the reworks in the OP.      New Quests  Quests of my own design      Ultrasonics  Native fauna research has shown that the Aliens react strangely to certain Ultrasonic frequencies, seeming pained or disoriented with different signals. Seismic readings also showed increased Worm activity during a larger scale test.  Replaces the Ultrasonic Fence building.    Harmony   Choose to research ultrasonics to make Aliens more docile. Construct a special ultrasonic node improvement for testing. Warning - early testing attracts Aliens. Defend the node against hostile small Aliens swarming it until the research is complete.   Reward  Though the test initially appeared to backfire, the aliens appear to have become more docile when the appropriate frequency was found. This may be the beginnings of a peaceful co-existence between man and alien.  One time Culture boost. + Harmony affinity points.  Instantly become Friendly with Aliens. Alien relations recover 30% faster. Alien relation recovery will continue past neutral status.    Purity   Choose to weaponize ultrasonics for small-scale weapons use. Test the new ultrasonic weapon subsystem prototypes by destroying an Alien Nest.   Reward  Data collected from the field has allowed our scientists to finalize our ultrasonic subweapon systems. Our soldiers gratefully welcome this new edge against the alien menace.  One time Food boost. + Purity affinity points.  +15% Combat Strength against Aliens, energy reward from capturing Alien Nests tripled.    Supremacy   Choose to research large-scale city repellent ultrasonics. Warning - early testing attracts a Siege Worm. A Siege Worm spawns near your capital, seeking to destroy it and any nearby units. Defeat it so that the test may be completed.   Reward  After a nearly disastrous start, we've managed to solve the Worm problem with our ultrasonics system. Because of this sacrifice, our cities will be safe behind an invisible line of defense.  One time Science boost. + Supremacy affinity points.  Aliens adjacent to your cities receive a -30% combat penalty. (Particularly useful against any more Siege Worms.)      New World Archaeology  First dismissed as baseless rumors, a large number of Progenitor Ruins have been recently confirmed to the world. We must secure them to uncover their secrets. At last, we know we are not alone in the stars!  Worldwide event, triggers at a semi-random time for all colonies.  Choice of rewards, not objectives.  Replaces current Progenitor Ruins.    General  Construct Expedition improvements on as many Progenitor ruins as possible, which give a large Science yield with no workers or cities required.  Hold four Progenitor Ruins for 50 turns.  Rewards  Huge one time Science boost. Receive points in an Affinity of your choosing.      Those That Came Before  Our scouts have detected ruins of previous, failed colonies on this planet. It would seem that attempted settlements began long before we arrived. We should investigate these ruins to learn their history and origins, and what we can learn from their failure.  Triggers upon sighting a Derelict Settlement.    Common Objectives   Construct an expedition on a Derelict Settlement. Communication logs revealed the locations of other failed colonies. Construct expeditions on them as well. Warning - logs suggest elevated Alien hostility among the ruins. It would appear that a failed Ultrasonic Fence system drove the Aliens into a frenzy, dooming the colonies they were constructed to protect. After fighting through hostile natives near the other Derelict Settlements and finishing your expeditions, choose how to deal with them.     Harmony  Choose to quickly disassemble the colony to put an immediate end to the still-active Ultrasonic Fence.  Reward  The Ultrasonic Fences made the colonies a threat to everyone, but their salvage will provide our colony with invaluable resources. Let this be a lesson to all that we must cautiously respect the local lifeforms.  A free Settler and Worker appear in your capitol city. Workers may now remove and salvage Derelict Settlements for a one time Production boost.  Gain large one time Production boost in your capitol. + Harmony affinity points.    Purity  Choose to memorialize the Derelict Settlements to ensure their brave, though unsuccessful colonization efforts are not forgotten.  Reward  It is a great tragedy that these colonies failed, but they will live on in our memory. Study of their records has also revealed some useful practices that can be adopted in our own colonization efforts.  Workers may now construct Colonial Memorials on Derelict Settlements, granting +10 Culture and -3 Energy.  Adopt three free Virtues. + Purity affinity points.    Supremacy  Choose to commission a thorough and intensive study on the technology and research efforts of the Derelict Settlements.  Reward  These colonies may have failed to endure on this hostile world, but their admirable efforts led to technological breakthroughs. Though they are gone, their progress will live on through us.  Gain two random ring 1 Technologies. Workers may now remove and salvage Derelict Settlements for a one time Production boost.  Gain a large one-time Science boost. + Supremacy affinity points.      Affinity Wars    In the spirit of contraversy, quests will begin to appear asking members of one affinity to declare war on and capture a city of a strong member of another affinity.  If such a war begins, colonies sharing an affinity with the attacked colony will receive a quest to defend them.  These quests give fairly generic energy, science, and culture rewards, but are meant to stir the pot and encourage Affinity wars.  This is the list of quasi-news reports that announce the Affinity war quests:  Harmony vs Purity  Harmonist protests escalate against the Alien ranching business centered in [Purity city], describing it as inhumane against such intelligent creatures. Purists defend the industry, claiming that the Harmonists are foolishly humanizing simple beasts. Harmonist and Purist tensions escalate.  Harmony vs Supremacy  Recent ecological reports over the [Supremacy city] industrial site have stirred a wave of outrage from Harmonists, who decry it as ecologically devastating and demand that harsh regulations be adopted. Supremacists claim that the Harmonists are overstating the ecological impact, and describe it as a small sacrifice in the name of progress. Harmonist and Supremacist tensions escalate.  Purity vs Harmony  An unexpected wind recently blew large swaths of miasma originating from the territory of [Harmony city] into a Purist settlement, causing an epidemic of miasma poisoning. Purists demand that the city take steps to thin its miasma clouds to prevent this from happening again, while Harmonists claim that the miasma is essential to the local ecosystem and should be adapted to. Purist and Harmonist tensions escalate.  Purity vs Supremacy  [Supremacy city]'s mandatory augmentations program has sparked protests from Purists, who claim that children should not be augmented at least until they can make the decision on their own. Supremacists defend the child augmentation program as minor and purely benign, ensuring that their vital organs remain healthy and arguing that it would be cruel to allow anyone to deny them these augmentations. Purist and Supremacist tensions escalate.  Supremacy vs Harmony  After an incident where aliens from a wildlife preserve near [Harmony city] wandered into and damaged Supremacy infrastructure, Supremacists call for a heavily reinforced border to the preserve. Harmonists claim that it would be harmful to the local ecosystem, and that the aliens are no threat when treated properly with infrastructure properly safeguarded against them. Supremacist and Harmonist tensions escalate.  Supremacy vs Purity  A new wave of locally unpopular augmentation bans and regulations in [Purity city] spurred a wave of Supremacist protests. They describe the laws as backwards and draconian, while Purists defend them as important for public safety and health against dangerous augmentations. Supremacist and Purist tensions escalate."
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,datgingah,10,Mon Mar 16 22:57:34 2015 UTC,"I could flesh out the more complex parts of this later, but I feel like quests should really add to some of these affinities end games.  Most of these affinities wouldn't tolerate each other on the same planet so there should be a late-game quest: like lvl 10 affinity late to promote war. Maybe you could get something like  Purity  Kill the Vermin  -declare war on a harmony civ  -attack a harmony civ's city  -raze a city of a harmony civ  -take the capital of a harmony civ.    Reward +3 (some purity unit) +Purity points +2 Free virtues then a counterpoint could be  Restore their humanity  -Declare war on a supremacy civ  -Annex a supremacy civ's city  -Capture a supremacy civ's capital  Reward +5 units +Purity points +20% energy/turn or   Supremacy  Liberate them from their bodies  -declare war on a Purity civ  -attack a Purity civ's city  -Puppet a city of a Purity civ  -take the capital of a Purity civ.  +3 units +Supremacy points +1 Free tech  And this could be done for each of the different affinities.  With the idea being high cost high reward.  Since its difficult to conquer, that means theres a less of a chance of these abilities snowballing.  The high reward promotes the risk.  The risk promotes much more difficult endgames. Could probably be balanced better, but this is just the basic idea."
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,Sivn,9,Tue Mar 17 05:47:27 2015 UTC,"I could see some occasional quests to capture a specific city, with an alert claiming they are conducting something your affinity views as an atrocity to justify it beyond general affinity warfare.  (Cruelty to Aliens, forced augmentation, harshly enforced augmentation ban despite a populus that does not want it, ect.)  Such a quest, I think, should only target players of different affinities while trying to select a powerful opponent.  I like how this could stir the pot in the late game."
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,datgingah,4,Tue Mar 17 06:00:47 2015 UTC,"I might even like this concept as a mid-game quest. Personally, I usually end up in a war late game anyway, but during the midgame this would give me a reason not to turtle."
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,datgingah,4,Tue Mar 17 14:50:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed, so long as it comes at a time where everyone is well-settled into an affinity.  I could even see AI's sharing the affinity in question being likely to stand beside the quest target, while those of the player's affinity might join in!  I really, really want to see some legitimate, difficult world wars in BE."
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,GhostfaceNoah,2,Tue Mar 17 18:54:29 2015 UTC,"The best part about it is, even if you the player didn't take the quest, that doesn't stop someone else from attacking you. War, what is it good for?  Making a great late game!"
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,GhostfaceNoah,4,Tue Mar 17 17:11:53 2015 UTC,"I like to think that the AI would receive and complete quests as well, including one to go to war with you.  There could even be an alert that the war quest is coming, like a news report like this, with sufficient variations:  Harmonist protests escalate against the Alien ranching business predominant in [City]. Purist and Harmonist international tensions rise.  In this case every Harmony affinity could receive a quest to go to war with the Purity civ and take that city, with all of them at war with them receiving the reward if they went to war when the quest asked.  All Purity civs on the other hand may receive a quest to retaliate against these radical Harmonists if any of them go to war for the quest, encouraging them to support the (strong) Purity civ in question and receiving a bonus if the war ends without that city taken, for how much they did in the war, ect."
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,GhostfaceNoah,3,Tue Mar 17 18:57:43 2015 UTC,"It would help create a strong future war, and actually give us a reason to unite with other players of the same faction."
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,GhostfaceNoah,2,Tue Mar 17 19:27:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I would love both of those things."
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,GhostfaceNoah,5,Tue Mar 17 19:28:52 2015 UTC,"I'd like there to be a Purity quest involving spreading Terrascapes. Like, if you make enough of them, they start to grow on their own or there is a reduction in their maintenance cost."
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,larknok1,5,Tue Mar 17 19:22:31 2015 UTC,"I modified one quest to require making three of them in a certain spot to complete the quest.  In the linked Devotions system idea I'd encourage Purity players to either scatter them between other tiles or make huge clusters of them for amazing yields.  Without that, I would have a questing making them easier to maintain, but not alongside it.  I would really like Terrascapes to be a common feature for Purity civs, while Supremacy ends up looking like a farmless industrial (wasteland) megacity."
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,Sivn,3,Tue Mar 17 19:27:40 2015 UTC,Maybe have Supremacy Quests that improve the tile yields of Nodes/Generators/Manufactories (especially adding food yields to make up for the loss of farms).
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,DefiantMars,3,Tue Mar 17 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"Part of aforementioned system would be, eventually, making Production count as Food for them among other things, like 33% of Energy output becoming Production in the city."
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,DefiantMars,3,Tue Mar 17 19:42:15 2015 UTC,"That would be really interesting, especially when you conquer a city of another affinity. It would actually require you to change the surrounding tile improvements so that the city would work/not starve with your faction."
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,DefiantMars,3,Tue Mar 17 19:44:44 2015 UTC,"True, they would have some incompatible infrastructures.  Harmony would eventually want to dump Miasma on their cities for some Health and a lot of late-game food."
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,DefiantMars,3,Tue Mar 17 19:50:36 2015 UTC,I would like Miasma to be more than just healing/hurting for Harmony. Like at a certain Harmony level it adds food/production/culture/health yields to tiles.
civbeyondearth,2zaclc,wolfdreams01,3,Tue Mar 17 19:53:38 2015 UTC,"Generally I'd make them kings of population growth and expansion, with bonuses for native biological resources and a love of Miasma.  The other affinities live on the planet, but Harmony set out to thrive there."
civbeyondearth,2zb9aj,draconon97,7,Tue Mar 17 03:25:02 2015 UTC,"You get a farm with titanium/geothermal or oil poking/bleeding through and you can send a worker to replace the farm with the resource-appropriate tile enhancement. It was like that in CivV, I expect it was like that back to the first Civ ever, and I have ""found"" oil on a few farm tiles in BE."
civbeyondearth,2zb9aj,igenchev82,3,Tue Mar 17 05:29:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the only difference between BE and V is that if you settle a city on the resource it is destroyed instead of automatically added once you have the appropriate tech."

Whether you're rushing hordes of Disciples or sending a few ANGELs, taking over Earth is not going to be a ""war.""  It's going to be Supremacy forces walking in, saying ""we're in charge,"" and doing whatever they want.  And the thing is, by late game you've got the technology to extract far more resources than people on Old Earth ever could.  It's a delicious source of resources where you'll be essentially unchallenged in any real sense for them."
civbeyondearth,2z8a57,Drake55645,8,Mon Mar 16 14:03:46 2015 UTC,"All of this assumes that Earth simply sat there for centuries and did nothing to scientifically advance.

civbeyondearth,2z8a57,gmharryc,13,Mon Mar 16 18:29:25 2015 UTC,"Nowhere near as close.  Remember, the colonies are starting their development from a position of low population, completely untapped and readily available resources, and already advanced technology.  Old Earth nations are starting from a position of next to no readily available resources, extremely high population, and while they have the same technology (initially), they don't have the resources to make good enough use of it.  Just look at how resource-intensive a lot of the stuff in Beyond Earth is, and then consider too that Old Earth doesn't have some of those resources at all."
civbeyondearth,2z8a57,Drake55645,11,Mon Mar 16 20:54:32 2015 UTC,"I had a crazy thought way back when that the fate of Earth could be randomized, only known when contact is established or if they act first.

The availability of resources, the necessity of change to survive the new planet, and the reduced presence of politics would seem to me that the members of the Beyond Earth Seeding would be significantly further ahead in terms of technology."
civbeyondearth,2z8a57,DefiantMars,4,Mon Mar 16 19:37:08 2015 UTC,"Unlikely, in the intros for each leader, it is stated quite clearly that tech advancement has been mostly routed to try and stabilize things and improve certain aspects of their lifes, and resources are all devoted to housing and caring for people, and one of the leaders, Reginaldo I think, says that each piece of the seed ship is one less bit of resources to house their massive populations, and it's very implied it's a 'for the greater good' solution even if Earth's population has to suffer a bit more because of it.  By the time we return, they MIGHT have stabilized things well enough, but they are not going to be on our level in weaponry, biology, and whatnot, at best you will find a world like ours at present, plus 50 or so years.

The copy-and-transfer and gradual replacement methods mentioned in the Neural Uploading civlopedia entry do not offer specifics, however both could involve fairly invasive, irreversible processes in which the original individual is essentially killed and not quite transferred. The mention of colonial futurists discounting associated ethical arguments does little to assuage concerned individuals, principally those back on Earth.  Firaxis left plenty of room for player interpretation fortunately, so all possibilities are still viable. Neural Uploading could be as uplifting or abhorrent as we decide to make it."

You have to remember things are bleak on Earth, it's not you they are asking, who has a nice enough life going on. Here, you would be asked this, to become a machine, powerful and with no need of food, that cant get tired, when up until that point you saw friends and family possibly starve or die of illness, had a harsh life of exhausting work to keep your city running, and overall being surrounded by a very post apocalyptic world.  I am also worried about this 'Am I really this machine' thing, but with that background? I am not sure I would have much care for that. Also, there are ways you could upload yourself without this issue. If I started to add bits of machinery to you, not the brain, and you slowly turned into a cyborg, until only your brain remains, then I have it so your brain has a way to store more information in 'memory sticks' in your body. Could I then, while you remain conscious all the time, move all 'files' from your main brain to these sticks and place a cybernetic brain in to fill the gap? (You had a secondary processor to 'run' you), would it still be you? you never fainted during this process as you would in the more common version which is what raises the issue if copying.

In all honesty, it's the only victory that handles the Earth problem directly (Unless you assume the aliens you contact will go and help us fix it). We are going back to try and fix it, whereas Harmony forgets about Earth completely. (I expected them to go and 'xenoform' it to be like the new world. And Purity sees the overcrowding problem of Earth, and their solution is to move everyone to this new planet. (Which by the point you build a gate, is getting crowded already, it's by no means a sparsely populated world) And abandoning the 'Earth' ship, despite so much glorifying it, of 'Old Earth' and it's wonders and glorious history. Nope, let's leave it."

civbeyondearth,2z81vk,fleshman03,6,Mon Mar 16 18:05:18 2015 UTC,"I've thought about that, and my solution is that within a game's interstellar map, there would be a small number of contested worlds, each one with a random smattering of civs, as will as smaller worlds with one civ each, and more with none. When you make contact with a world that already has your sponsor/affinity combo present, they will automatically join your federation, and the same would go for your rivals. So if your big rivals in your home world are ARC/Purity, and you're slow to develop the tech for interstellar travel, you might find a preexisting ARC/Purity civ from another contested world or from a smaller one-civ world making first contact and absorbing into your rival. Conversely, if you're playing as AU/Harmony, and another AU/Harmony civ arrives, you will merge into their hivemind and be given control of the federation they have already established. In this way, there would be a race to find and unite the various colonies sharing your culture and society, and the large contested worlds and empty worlds would each become an on-the-ground battleground, while the smaller worlds and city-state/quest-based worlds would feed you resources, and your ships would conduct warfare among the stars. As I said in the post, each world would become essentially uncontested once one faction on that world had completed the hegemony wonder/quest specific to their affinity, or had achieved domination on that world. The double-edged swords of this approach are that you as the player would have to juggle multiple contested planets and the interstellar map all at the same time, and there would have to be alternate faction leaders, at least enough for each sponsor/affinity combo, so as not to break immersion. The plus, I think, is that this would provide the kind of complexity and challenge we've all been looking for, though I admit it would drastically change the game."

civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,MoXria,51,Sat Mar 14 14:07:45 2015 UTC,"I'll separate my suggestions into two categories: fixes and new ideas.     Fixes (in order of importance [high to low]):       1) Increase Affinity required for victory wonders to 16 from 13. This adds another 30-40 turns of late game to the game, which the game SO desperately needs.     2) Decrease the cost of Cybernetics+Autogyros and Augmentation+Surrogacy as well as the number Affinity points given. Some people would actually like to be able to use the AEGIS and CARVR.     3) Buff wonders. I like that they are more unique now, but for the love of god, make them good.     4) Fully animated victories and well-drawn pictures full of flavor for each of the wonders. Let's be honest -- the game desperately needs flavor.     5) Re-balance quest choices. A lot of the quests are completely unbalanced. One energy IS NOT equal to one production.     6) Covert Ops and intrigue should be invisible until you place a spy in your own city or build a certain building. As it stands, covert ops are not sneaky at all, and are one of the most easily countered things in the game. I'd love for them to be threatening and fun again.     7)  Be able to name units. Speaks for itself. This should be a staple.       New ideas [no particular order]:       1) More early satellites. Also, buff satellites. The more satellites there are in the game, the more important satellite competition becomes. Before the game shipped, I thought there would be competition for satellite space -- and there is to some extent in Multiplayer games, but not in AI games.      2) Some system to make the player particularly worried just because players of other Affinities exist. This was done in BNW with the massive negative happiness penalty from other ideologies. I've suggested my own idea of Affinity Tug-of-war, but it doesn't need to be that way. The game just needs some system to make me naturally ally with other players of my affinity and dislike players of other affinities.      3) Melee ship. I don't even need to say anything else.     4) For the game to grow, the tech web needs to be a bit bigger. Perhaps add another tech at every ring around the web and re-place all the current assets and new assets for more balance?     5) More sponsors. Yeeep, self-explanatory.     6) Another resource to manage. BNW had faith -- but I have no intention of saying that BE needs a religion system. What it needs is another resource to manage that involves other players and is used for particular upgrades -- like religion -- but it doesn't have to have the same mechanics of acquisition or flavor at all. This can be tied in fundamenally in 7) below, but doesn't need to be.     7) A system of non-affinity quests that the player can explore without anything being random. Imagine a quest tree where you can start each quest by ""purchasing it"" for a certain cost -- culture, energy, resources, affinity xp -- and then you have to accomplish the quest for very specific rewards (as well as unlocking other quests in the tree.) You could explore the whole tree, or just go a certain route for the rewards you want. They'll all relate to living on planet and adjusting to life as you go down the quests. This could add a bunch of flavor, complexity, and fun to the game."
civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,larknok1,26,Sat Mar 14 18:11:17 2015 UTC,"You.  I like you.  I'd also add a few things.   SUBMARINES.  I really don't see how these are missing. Planet Busters.  They're literally stated to exist in the entry for Nanothermite, yet we don't get them.  I want to tear a chunk out of a continent, and have everyone hate me for it! Defining your Affinity.  I've mentioned this a few times, I would love a system where, as you progress further into your Affinity, at certain points you can define what it particularly values.  How do your people view civs with different Affinities?  What's their view on the native life?  Are they militantly opposed to the existence of the other Affinities, are they tolerant, or do they just shut the others out? Unique units for each sponsor.  Everyone would start with the same stuff, but at Tier 3 it would become their unique unit.  For instance, Polystralia could get a unique ship when it upgrades from a Cruiser, with distinct abilities regardless of Affinity, Rejinaldo could have a unique rover unit, things like that. Major diplomatic implications of Affinities.  This ties in with number 3 here.  Depending on the route you take with your Affinity, you could end up with major penalties in diplomacy with different Affinities, made up for with bonuses to diplomacy and trade with civs of the same Affinity.  Ideally this would lead to blocs forming based on Affinity, possibly resulting in a three-way war when someone builds an endgame Wonder.  And if you decide to be super tolerant of other Affinities, you could well take on the role of a peacemaker, though more extreme advocates of your Affinity might think you're unprincipled."
civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,Drake55645,4,Sat Mar 14 22:01:15 2015 UTC,"3 is something I'd love. One thing I've really felt missing in Civ from IV was the fact there wasn't really a way to define what your government was, how it functioned or anything else really related towards your civilization and how it functioned. Now, with BE we all pretty much have the same civilization and culture at the start but diverge with affinities and I'd like to really build and flesh my own take on things with negative and positive reactions;."
civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,Steel_Within,2,Sun Mar 15 07:49:08 2015 UTC,"I'd also love to see some differentiation within the affinities as that would provide more variety mechanically and, at the same time, explore the meaning of an affinity. Story-wise, there is a lot of potential:  *...is Purity about self-improvement and philosophical enlightenment (the ""perfect humanist"") or about xenophobia and eugenicism (the ""perfect body"")? *...is Supremacy about being self-reliant and free of corporeal ills (the singularity etc.) or about being a hegemonising swarm (aka the Borg)? *...is Harmony about being in tune with nature (blue Avatar aliens) or mad science (genetic splicing)?  The story hints are all there, give us some mechanics to back that up! That way, the mechanical and the presentation side gains a lot.  Also, bring back wonder paintings. I can do without victory videos but there needs to be a good painting, a good quote and a victory overview (scoreboard etc.), not the random soldiers and planetary wonder paintings we have at the moment."

civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,DefiantMars,8,Tue Mar 17 01:16:23 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree. I rather wish that technology raised an affinity ""cap"", with quests being a much bigger part of raising affinity. Perhaps even alliances with a certain affinity raise yours, and wars on a different affinity let you raise yours (if it's opposing)?.   I like the idea of expanded quest lines to do this, since it's a nice way of dealing with this game mechanic. Affinity should be something you convince your populace to follow, limited by present technology, in my personal opinion. Not that I'm going to be annoyed if the game just continues to handle things in this manner.  The whole ""caring about other's affinity"" thing is a tricky one: Perhaps trade bonuses for the same affinity, penalties on the inverse. A bonus for being the highest culture of the dominant affinity on the planet (or some scaling percentage), as well as some version of the ""early adopter"" thing to encourage diversification. Which would be tricky, but would both encourage you to support the same affinity, force others to do the same, while also making opposing affinities useful to be."
civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,Velrei,2,Sat Mar 14 22:14:14 2015 UTC,"The ""affinity cap"" idea is great and I really think BNW got the right idea with aggressive/defensive culture with the tourism/culture split.  Together, you could actually implement a similar system where you have culture and affinity points, with culture forming defence affinity points allowing you to level up your affinity while at the same time exerting pressure at other factions.  Technology would still set the pace but you would have a more natural way of earning affinities through your affinity yields and at the same time it would add tension between the factions and for trading (as it's quite a prominent part of the game).  While this sounds a lot like going back to BNW, I don't think it would be, either - having three separate affinity yields, no great works systems, affinity bonuses you ""level"" up etc. would still make that a rather unique system."
civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,WhatGravitas,1 point,Sun Mar 15 23:55:23 2015 UTC,"I made another post on this (in this thread) that sums up a few ideas to give some interesting dynamics for the affinities that might help diversity what an affinity is beyond different structures and units in this topic:   http://www.reddit.com/r/civbeyondearth/comments/2z0pn5/wjat_do_you_want_to_see_in_beyond_earth_20_update/cpf2amb   Perhaps you have an idea for the Purity one, or can improve my idea?"
civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,Velrei,5,Mon Mar 16 01:35:36 2015 UTC,"I like a lot of your ideas.   Affinity really does need a bigger impact in more than just unit upgrades an near useless bonuses. I like the idea idea of more levels and i think they should be harder to earn, maybe either have them only linked to tech or fewer in the techweb, or quests only.   Or could link them to the new resource idea you suggested, and have a completely different way to earn them.  Plus having a revamped world Congress would be cool, would make  the idea of being worriedabout other affinities Have a larger impact, like auto alliances or wars, but then still have internal power struggles with your fellow affinityites on who will lead your belief structure."
civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,cowfudger,3,Sat Mar 14 21:18:54 2015 UTC,"Aliens being a real ally to Harmony and a threat game round could give a reason for Harmony colonies to buddy up and a cause for conflict between them and other affinities.  Not sure on the others - perhaps Supremacy could produce some pollution that lowers non-Supremacy faction health?  Purity's focus on clearing Aliens could make them an indirect threat of sorts if the Aliens were more easily riled up and more dangerous when disturbed.    We really need more quests, and I like the idea of being able to purchase quests somehow.  Perhaps quest points could be gained at the end of a quest to make a progression from smaller to larger quests, generally, or tactics of adopting many smaller ones.  That said I would really like quests to feel more active and encourage competition and war between colonies.  Simple ""research and build X"" or ""excavate a ruin in your territory that noone has significant incentive to contest"" quests get boring quickly."
civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,Galgus,4,Sun Mar 15 07:07:03 2015 UTC,"Purity quest I came up with on the spot.  A resource pod from Old Earth has crash-landed containing a treasure trove valuable relics and technology.  A Supremacy civilization reaches the pod first and constructs an expedition.  You're now presented with the fact that they ARE going to take the technology and in the process destroy the priceless relics (which they consider worthless trash), which you as a Purity colony desire for their cultural value.  [Declare war, these relics must be saved at all costs!]  If the explorer is destroyed, gain 4 Relics for the Terra Vault, +4 culture for trade routes to Purity civilizations, +1 relationship boost with Purity civilizations, -1 relationship with Supremacy civilizaitons  [Pay the Civilization to save some of the relics.]  2 Relics saved, 2 destroyed, +2 culture in trade routes to Purity civilizations  [Allow the expedition to continue, they found it first.]  All Relics lost.  +2 Science from trade routes to this Civilizations, +1 relationship boost to Supremacy civilizations, -1 relationship penalty with Purity civilizations  And, obviously, there would be a Supremacy version of this quest as well."
civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,Drake55645,2,Mon Mar 16 14:22:26 2015 UTC,"I would love this kind of quest, and this would work equally well with Progenitor Ruins and, perhaps, derelict settlements.  I'd think the way to go would be making quest expeditions take far longer, enough to an army to reasonably arrive to stop them, but with much greater rewards on completion.  Ideally wars would be sparked over such things, and AIs would throw their weight around to claim them."

civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,DefiantMars,2,Mon Mar 16 18:34:17 2015 UTC,"Great ideas.  For the additional resource, maybe oxygen?  It could be harvested like faith was in V on certain tiles, like canyons.  I'm not sure how interactive it would be, but I like the idea of being terrified of running out of oxygen.  The world feels too safe right now."
civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,vonDriessen,8,Sun Mar 15 15:23:43 2015 UTC,"I'd like many things to spice up the game and push quests harder.      More Distinct Biomes    More distinction in threats and native resources in Biomes.  Ideally some new Alien types or simply Alien frequency could change between them, while some maps favor different basic resource types.  Aliens could have different skins and subtypes per biome, and Harmony graphics could change slightly to match their home   Arid - Wealth of mineral resources with some oases where Alien wildlife dwells, attractive for settlement but thick with nests. Clusters of riches lie across the wastes, where the Siege Worms roam. Below average Miasma, thickest in the oasis zones.  Fungal - Miasma is thicker than normal, and Aliens cluster around fungal forests where it is thickest. The open lands are fairly safe, but expansion must eventually step in to claim the dangerous forests.  Lush - Aliens and Miasma are dispersed fairly evenly, with the only threat of note being higher than normal Alien populations.  Tundra - In ways a mirror of Arid environments, yet laden with snow. But smaller Aliens swarm the wastes, while Siege Worms preside over region with food.    Multi-Biome Maps    Allow maps to have different regions with different biomes, giving a huge world more variety.  I would enjoy the variety of an arid region of the planet bordering a lush forest, and so on.  Biomes would be generated based on elevation, closeness to water and the equator, and some manner of random factors.  Any number of Biomes could be selected in map setup.    More Active Quests    Quests that stir the pot and encourage conflict and competition over objectives and different goals.  Ideally they should also tell some story of your colony - like how you respond to the Aliens.    Federations    I'll summarize it, but the main write-up is here so as to not clutter things.  Formal alliances between players where players who choose to join them can vote on matters of war, construction of international projects tied to the federation, and electing a federation leader.  The benefits of being federation leader are choosing a bonus from a list that all colonies in your federation shares and being the tiebreaker in votes.  Choosing to not go to war or declare peace with a federation forces one to leave the federation, and one incurs a diplomacy penalty for doing so - but less of one if they didn't leave suddenly.  Federation members can conduct espionage on their allies easier as a risk.  If a single Federation holds all colonies that retain their capital, the federation leader wins a Federation Victory after a countdown period.  The goal of it is to make solid alliances and world wars more likely, and make diplomacy more dependable.    New Victory Conditions for Major/minor affinities    Each Major/minor affinity would receive its own victory condition, each with different requirements.  This would give more immersive visions for the future for players to choose from.  This is the write-up, but to summarize briefly I'll state the names of each victory.  Purity/ purity - Earth's Renewal  Purity/ harmony - Promised Land  Purity/ supremacy - Terraformation  Supremacy/ supremacy - Endless Voyage  Supremacy/ purity - Emancipation  Supremacy/ harmony - Singularity  Harmony/ harmony - Transcendence  Harmony/ supremacy - Xenoseeding  Harmony/ purity - Xenoformation    Affinity Devotions System    A new system that functions like a second Virtue system or the Ideology system from Civ 5, with some differences.  The goal of the system would be to give each affinity very different play-styles that fit thematically - actual bonuses in the link.  1   Science and Culture are used to purchase Devotions, though Culture is much more dominant.  2  Devotion costs do not increase per Devotion or Virtue unlocked.  3  Devotions are unlocked based on Affinity level.  4  More Powerful, less numerous, and more expensive, than most Virtues. In a single line of bonuses rather than a branching tree.    Natural Wonders with Affinity quest decisions    Natural Wonders to be uncovered by expedition that, after a time, present Affinity-based options on how to develop them.  Essentially their base form is decent in the early game while their developed form keeps them relevant later on - and adds some flavor to one's affinity.    Alien Hostility Overhaul    Make Aliens easier to anger and eager to swarm and destroy all human cities at high aggression thresholds.  Harmony can choose to make Aliens stronger with trade routes to nests, and eventually the Aliens become powerful allies for colonies following that affinity that actively attack their enemies.  Colossal Aliens require higher aggression thresholds to frenzy.    Unique Unique Units    Give all unique units special abilities or quirks that give them new roles, and distinguish them from vanilla units in more than just price and strength.  For example, Xeno Swarms could require no upkeep and move unimpeded through rough terrain and CNDRs could be produced two at a time with an innate boost when next to another unit.    New Great People System*    I like the idea of Great People in the game again, but  I'd personally prefer them to give unique bonuses based on their contribution.  It would be harder to balance, but it would give them a bit more personality: with the mechanics themselves telling part of the story of why they are important.  This was my pilot idea for that, though there were some good thoughts on Great People for the game in this old thread.  Great Purist Merchant: Vont Telvin  The rich and famous ARC engineer who, in 2632, fulfilled a dream humanity had fantasized for centuries: the flying car. His career began with a solid Central education slated for a cushy Liberation Army job, but that took a twist when he left the military to form his own civilian company. Though he led the development of many small joys and tools, he is forever remembered for revolutionizing early Floatstone tech. By improving the refining process and energy input to the core while creating a sturdy, yet light and simple frame, he introduced the Model Z floating car. The improvements in efficiency, all-terrain mobility, and cheap and easy maintenance revolutionized ARC's transportation industry and opened the door to previously unimagined feats of engineering. A new and improved Mark 2 Float Tank was quickly developed on the heels of the civilian market: ensuring swifter and safer ""liberations"". Effect - +1 Energy from Trade Routes and +1 Movement for Purity Calvary.    Tradable Resource System    Awhile back I had an idea for an alternate luxury system where colonies would receive bonuses for different resources, rather than a health focused system.  It may be a bit too over-the-top a system, but these are rough examples of it:  Silica +10% Science  Gold (Somewhat rare resource) +10% Culture and +5% Energy  Earth Crops - Produced by Terrascapes +5% Food and +5% Health  Earth Livestock - Produced by Domes +5% Food and +5% Culture  Implants - Produced by Optical Surgery +5% Science +5% Culture  Augments - Produced by Augmentery +5% Science +5% Production  Sentry Turrets - Produced by Defensive Perimeter +15% City Defense  Soma - Produced by Soma Distillery +5% Health +5% Culture  Designer Lifeforms - Produced by Gene Smelters when Designer Lifeforms is researched. +5% Food, +5% Science    Undersea Cities    Out there suggestion and a bit of a pipe dream, but it could spice the game up.  Unlocked at a mid-late point in the game, undersea cities allow players to expand beneath the ocean.  The depths are essentially another layer like the Orbital layer, and settling there requires heavy upfront expenses that take time to pay off.  To make matters worse there are some new colossal Aliens lurking beneath the waves to threaten expansion, but players may find riches and space for expansion under the oceans if they can keep settlements safe.    Possible Fourth Affinity?    Really out there idea, just how I would do another Affinity.  The current three affinities cover possibilities well enough that I'm not sure there is room for a fourth, but I formed an idea for one called Discovery in the hype leading up to BE.  Discovery essentially explores a possible reaction to the discovery of the Progenitors where they are revered as a sort of perfectly advanced race and culture."

There is nothing more irritating than not being able to get ships to the other side of the map because of a SINGLE ice tile or a SINGLE peninsula tile.  Second: More alien types. Specifically ones that make sense based on where they spawn. Why in the world can the exact same raptor bug spawn in: Tundra, snow, desert, grassland, forest, etc. Why are all siege worms the same? You would think one in a desert would be a bit weaker than one that has to dig through tundra.  Third: Can our wonders actually be good? Please, for fucks sake, at least revert the Deep Memory.  Fourth: http://www.reddit.com/r/civbeyondearth/comments/2y8nrc/expansion_ideas_mapaliens/  Can we PLEASE get some more variance in planets? Where are the extremely volcanic worlds?  Lava mechanics. Different day/night cycles.   Fifth: More military units. Where are the submarines? Where are the air-born army carriers? Where are the air ships? Its not like the tech isn't there. We have lev plants.   Sixth: Some actual flavor. When I got this game, one of the biggest things for me was being able to RP a bit. Make it seem like I'm really colonizing a new world. Embrace the affinity you chose.  There is almost NONE of that. I can't even really enjoy this game from an RP standpoint. I can't choose my own affinity. Thats deadlocked by what resources I end up getting near me. (Purity is my least favorite RP affinity and I ALWAYS FUCKING GET the floatstone.)   The sponsors are boring and flat. They have no personality beyond the same irritating ""whats mine is yours....for a price"" lines they endlessly repeat every time they come to you or when they're decrying your affinity choice. Diplomacy is practically nonexistent. Favors mean nothing and are bloody worthless unless its to force a war declaration on another AI (and even then it only works if you're at least neutral with them, and they wont actually commit anything in my experience). There are no luxury resources. No ""world congress"" type thing. Stations are just annoying little shits that land where you want to colonize and have no personality. They fall far short of city states. (And you can't even tell enemy AI to stop attacking your stations but they can endlessly cry about it when you do it.)  All the AI just fall flat personality wise.  Like, I'm sure I can find other things to rant about in regards to flavor, but I'll just leave it at that.  If I think of other things to add to this list I'll stop by again."

It could have its own upgrade path similar to the culturally virtue system, only smaller.  They could also change the orbital units to be only very few that have an upgrade path akin to that of the military units. The Space station could allow mining colonies on nearby asteroids (as suggested below)."

(like CIV 5.. if you went England your navy was great ETC.)  edit:   tweak some tile improvement:   'Manufactory': keep the production / minus healt ratio, but 'increase' the production. exemple:   5 production, -3 health, -2 energy   instead of   3 production, -2 health, -2 energy.  'dome': increase the culture bonus (or more upgrade from tech).

civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,WhatGravitas,5,Sat Mar 14 20:13:03 2015 UTC,"On Aliens and Harmony: I think the metagame of dealing with the AI and it's desire to destroy or not destroy aliens/miasma would make more sense if Harmony affinity made the aliens tougher, like as we're adapting to them, they're adapting to us (and perhaps introducing new strains). That really sets up a stark difference between Harmony and the other two affinities.   Also the miasma repulsor really shouldn't be a harmony tech, a good argument could be made for supremacy or purity, optimally I feel it should be part of Alien Sciences (which should probably have a leaf Purity tech instead of Alien Ecology, perhaps something to add one more resource to Domes, like science)  I feel my idea for Harmony and the Aliens could be replicated with some other mechanics, but right now my only idea is that spying could correlate to Supremacy affinity, the more in the game, the more complicated/powerful it can become (intrigue rate?), with Supremacy points in a faction perhaps giving it a further boost on the offense and penalty on the defense. The reasoning being that experimentation with AI's and cybernetics would produce the optimal environment for that.   A purity equivalent would probably involve something cultural related to the remembrance of earth, but at the moment I can't think of an interesting way to implement that."
civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,Velrei,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"I think an interesting way to deal with the alien/miasma thing would be tying all of them together and connect them to an essential Civ system: tile improvements.  What should really be the case is that miasma should have a global impact: with high miasma levels, all improvements (and outpost/city growth) take longer, then each affinity has its unique way to deal with it:   Purity: removes miasma, bolstering city growth and tile improvement on a large scale, assisted by the terraforming-related technologies (meaning even lagging back, they can ""brute force"" a decent-ish expansion through wonders and food buildings). Finally, make domes ""villages"" (see Civ4) that eventually grow into Terrascapes depending on the culture output of the working city. Harmony: affinity levels reduce city growth penalty and add various yield bonuses from miasma, meaning at first, they want to ignore miasma and then start spreading it (once the tile yield bonuses kick in). Supremacy: at higher affinities, energy becomes a (partial) food substitute to compensate for the slower city growth and satellites can help a lot with city growth and tile yields independently of the actual planetary state (very Supremacy).   That way, you bring the affinities back to what matters - the game map - and hook it straight into what makes Civ Civ."

civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,DefiantMars,8,Sun Mar 15 00:14:11 2015 UTC,"Here's an unfiltered stream of consciousness list.    The veterancy system is a pale shadow of civ 5.    Religion totally missing.  I know its sci-fi, so may not fit the setting, but it is noteworthy.  Game needs more sponsers.  The AI fights very poorly, in terms of tactics.  On any difficulty pit me vs a computer with double the number of units, and I'll win, every time.  The only way the AI is a threat is if they have triple or more of your units.  And even then you can hold them off if you can use geography for choke points.  The AI's pathing is really bad near choke points and around mountains.  The easy solution here is to simply spawn maps with less mountains and canyons.  The hard fix is to program the AI to go perform strategic level flanking moves.  Instead of advancing thru the narrow mountain pass, instead flank around with a major naval operation.  The AI rarely does this sort of thing, and usually botches naval invasions anyways, because they don't keep units together in a cohesive force.  Transcendence win is vastly easier than the other affinity wins.  The aliens are totally harmless at this point.  They would have to ignore ultrasonic fences once Mind Flower is build, stay at max violence level, spawn vastly more units, and...  Aliens don't level up in any way and are harmless past turn 100, sometimes sooner.  They should level up, spawning tougher units.  Diplomacy has way too many annoying choice-less interruptions.  Affinity insults, general insults, etc.  Breaking the flow of the game just to insult me is a waste of my time.  A diplomacy light game option would be awesome, cut all the insults, and have the AI not initiate contact, except when actually important.  If I want something from the AI, I can initiate contact.  Underwater cities (from another commenter) sounds pretty cool, if fleshed out.   Seems like alot of work, but would make for a keystone feature of a major xpac.  That's all I got off the top of my head :)    TLDR:  A short list of suggestions for an xpac."

Will they just retweak current things or are they going to do something closer to a small expansion?  That really limits what i should ask for, however here are my suggestions.  Change the web tech so that its is easy to tell what is each thing at a simple glance, just like in civ 5. In civ 5 it was very easy to tell what was a unit, what was a building or a wonder etc...  Here its actually hard, you really have to mouse over for many things... thats just poor UI design.  Also, add more filters, if possible, allow me to combine them with one another.  I liked the tech web because its something different compared to Civ 5's tech tree, in fact i liked all the differences, like how you automaticlly know all of the other civs without exploring, how the expansion do not become a city immediatley but they take time to become a city, and how you can use trade routs to make them grow faster, using explorers to dig sites, the ""build your own civ with your own bonuses"" at the start, those things made BE interesting, its such a shame theres little focus on the differences.  Id say make the differences much more important. Its ok to make civ 5 the template for BE, but make BE its own thing. Right now it feels like a stripped down civ 5 with a different theme and some small tweaks, i expected many many more differences.   I would like for the aliens to be something more than what they currently are. Im not sure what you can do with them, but do something. I suggest making them their own kind of Civ, that you cannot interact with through menus. Something similar to the city states from 5, but with its own spin, they cannot win the game, but they could give you boosts or make your life a pain, or just ignore you. Maybe if you dont kill them, they trust you and dont attack back, if you help their units against other civs, they will eventually be your ally, giving you units. If you kill them, they become hostile, and if you kill lots of them, they will eventually go into full out war, sending waves of units towards you. Make them their own thing, not just rouge units moving around the map randomly. Most of the time i just ignore the aliens, they only offer gameplay value at the start becuase your explorers die quickly to them, thats about it, they are a small annoyance while exploring and nothing more."

If you dig into the Civilopedia it actually has a lot of flavor, which it seems everyone feels is missing. There are two places where I think this could be brought out fairly easily with potent effect.  The first place I feel that the lore could be brought out is reinforcing the personalities of the Sponsor leaders. More dialogue when talking to the leaders, even in mere text form, would help greatly.  The second place to expand would be quests and by extension, the affinities. Beefing up the quest flavor will help with immersion. I never played Alpha Centauri, but I have watched a few games. One of the things that struck me were the Interludes which advanced the plot of the game and also provided in game hints on how to proceed.  Another point that I would like to see addressed are the strengths of the affinities; making the advantages of each more prominent going forward."

Workers: Basically all I want is to automate them without having my miasma removed and having terrascapes littered across my territory. Blacklisting those two functions would be great, and if I could prioritize Add Miasma, that would be even better."

civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,sirbruce,6,Sat Mar 14 20:13:39 2015 UTC,What sort of DLC would you wanna see?
civbeyondearth,2z0pn5,sirbruce,-3,Sat Mar 14 20:20:46 2015 UTC,"At this point, I am not sure there is much saving of BE in DLC. The base game is just so vastly devoid of content that there really isn't much to build on unless the DLC is a straight up overhaul of the game.  That said, in a perfect world, I'd like to see the introduction of intelligent alien life as either playable or NPC factions akin to city-states(With victory conditions that work with it, perhaps like 'tourism', in having diplomacy with these factions that yields technology and such, or a victory condition that can revolve around either aiding these creatures or subjugating them.).  The current 'nations' in the game also utterly lack any sort of depth and personality. I'd really like to seem them get more 'personal' dialogue akin to the older games, as opposed to them all having the same copy-pasted lines(Seriously, are there only like 10 pieces of dialogue in all of BE? None of them even have voice acting.).  Honestly, for the setting, the diversity is pretty crap. Everyone uses the same units, for the most part, with affinities occasionally giving some minor differences. I'd like to see the nations involved have more that sets them apart, like unique units(That may or may not be affected by affinity.).  Military could use love too. Right now, there really isn't a whole lot of use for the orbital layer. I'd love to see an orbital navy component of the game, with orbital fighters and ships that fight for control of the sky's sky and force more emphasis on satellites and such. Obviously, there could be ground units and structures meant for defense against orbital units, kind of like Planetary Annihilation.  A lot of people already asked for aquatic cities and I agree. It'd be pretty nice to enjoy the defensive bonuses of having a city underwater and requiring special strategy to remove them, at the cost of difficulty in accessing resources or attacking others. Heck, even make it so underwater cities can't be attacked by orbital units.  Frankly, there's just so much that could have been done with BE that I could go on forever. As it is now, it's just an empty, soulless conversion mod for base-Civ V without any expansions, and does almost -nothing- with the setting it has to set itself apart from other Civ games in any particularly interesting or different way. Honestly, the lack of an Alien faction of any sort, playable or otherwise, is a massive waste of potential. Everything is just too 'safe' and boring in it's current state."

civbeyondearth,2yycng,PeacekeepingTroops,2,Tue Mar 17 12:24:29 2015 UTC,"Try changing the order to building mines first, then improve any resources you can around you then farms, only build generators if you are having money problems I have never found them all that good.  Also use the tectonic scanner to reveal all resources for you.   Trade routes are super important, don't neglect them, they are one of the first things I build, and almost always send them internally, except if I have a neighbor I want to be friendly with.  When you play do you focus an affinity?  My suggestion would be to try playing as harmony, research the prerequisite techs needed to build the mind flower by the time you are hitting level 13 affinity.  While building the wonder send all your trade routes internally to your capital (or whichever city is building it) and you should be ok to win the game.  You could also try going supremacy or purity as well, but after you build the wonder you actively have to use the wonder to win.  Supremacy requires you to send X troops back to earth where Purity requires you to bring colonists to the new world.  So mind flower is by far the easiest of the affinity victories.   Edit: Also, try going down the Might virtue tree until you get the 20% bonus to affinity through research, then switch to industry until you are ready for the free affinity level.  I like to save mine until I am at 10-11ish where I can maximize it, so when I finish the required techs for victory I am at 13 for my desired affinity.    Edit 2: You can also enter advanced settings and turn off certain victory requirements to allow you more time to pursue your victory of choice (turning off contact victory as it is by far the easiest and quickest if you get lucky)."

I have had games go on for almost 500 turns, so surviving isn't my main problem. I make wonders, I research everything I can that helps me too. Where would I find the saved game to send?

civbeyondearth,2yycng,Chester2674,7,Fri Mar 13 21:49:11 2015 UTC,"If it's a Wonder victory you keep losing to, put spies everywhere.  Make sure you know what everyone's capital is building.

I very nearly lost my first game (on Gemini!) to Hutama, who I caught building the Mind Flower by pure chance.  By the way, BE typically doesn't last to turn 400.  What victory do you typically go for?  If you're going for an Affinity victory, you need to get to Level 12 in that Affinity.  In addition, you need to get a prerequisite tech as well - for Supremacy and Purity, you need to grab Orbital Networks and build the Lasercom Satellite, then get Nanotechnology (Purity) or Hypercomputing (Supremacy) to build a Gate (again, must be Level 12 to do this).

This is more like ""play Ace Patrol, get the WW1 Germany civ in Civ 5!"". The ultrasonic emitter from Xenomanagement even gets its own unit model.  Especially for multiplayer, this is super-annoying, even more so than itty-bitty DLC.

Just because the AI beats you doesn't mean it's a good game. I'm not fond of being punished for not pushing the right buttons when the game requires me to. Not my kind of game.
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,crasher_pt,1 point,Thu Mar 12 15:16:48 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying the hell out of it.  1000 odd hours in Civ5, similar in Alpha Centauri, Civ4, Civ3, Civ2.  The changes are pretty good, surprising depth.  Wish I knew more people for good MP games since the AI is iffy, but the mechanics are good."
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,Theotropho,8,Fri Apr 3 15:16:05 2015 UTC,So...  I'm not sure what exactly they're gonna fix.  Diplomacy? They said the diplomacy worked really well in civ5. Uh...  Wonders? Thought they just fixed those...  I've reread the thing twice now and it seems very vague. Did I just miss something?
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,8Rounds,8,Thu Mar 12 17:48:49 2015 UTC,"Diplomacy is the biggest thing I think, especially trading. I never deal with the ai, seems like the favors are generally worthless"
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,thisrockismyboone,4,Thu Mar 12 20:06:06 2015 UTC,"You can trade favours in later in the game. They're normally worth 100 e. But who says your social standing with the AI will be the same in the future? They need to make favours NOT depreciate in value. That way, you can amass them and trade them for something big with an AI You don't like later on."
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,think_once_more,2,Thu Mar 12 21:49:28 2015 UTC,The way favors work is so vague that I've stopped dealing with them.  I had 7 favors racked up once and that still wasn't enough to make a faction declare war on one of my enemies.
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,boxtears,3,Thu Mar 12 22:38:30 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I wasn't really arguing for them, they seem to be a placeholder. They need to be stronger, or constant, or something else entirely."
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,think_once_more,2,Thu Mar 12 23:12:04 2015 UTC,"The loss of luxury resources from Civ 5 and council votes in BNW really takes away from diplomacy options and strategy in BE.  The only time I'm ever contacted anymore is in situations involving conflict or trade for strategic resources. Boring.  With that much taken away, I should at least be allowed to flirt with opposing faction leaders and gain alliances through seduction.  Something.  ANYTHING."
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,boxtears,4,Thu Mar 12 23:40:01 2015 UTC,Wonders have already gotten some love in the latest patch to make their bonuses much more interesting and attractive.
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,pookie_wocket,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know, that's why I was curious as to why one of the things they mentioned as one of their 'big mistakes' they are going to fix is Wonders..."
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,8Rounds,5,Thu Mar 12 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"Well I think that making the wonders mechanically effective is only half the problem. You also have to make them... narratively effective? There needs to be some back story for them, or a movie, or a better in-game representation of them or something."
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,pookie_wocket,3,Thu Mar 12 19:40:55 2015 UTC,I hope that's not the kind of changes we're going to be seeing
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,Whales96,1 point,Fri Mar 13 03:03:23 2015 UTC,I'm wondering the same.  Seems like the author didn't really have much info from the developers at this point.  I think we'll have to wait for a message from firaxis about patch notes to know for sure.
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,vonDriessen,6,Thu Mar 12 19:40:36 2015 UTC,"Civilization, before Beyond Earth, was always grounded in our planet and its history. That's why the series' diplomacy and leader systems, which cover relationships between civilizations and place well-known historical figures as their spokespeople, work so well.    You gotta be kidding me! Civ 5 is a fantastic game with Brave New World, but if there is one thing they never fixed or made even vaguely interesting, its the diplomacy between civs. I know they tried to move away from religions having such an outsized influence on diplomacy in civ 4, but they never replaced it with anything. I really really hope they radically overhaul the diplomacy system in BE, but that means overhauling the AI as well. Its a bit better now that the patch made them more aggressive, but they still make blatantly foolish decisions or nonsensical offers. Favors is a good idea, but they aren't implemented well. They still dont do anything and I never really want them. I basically ignore the AI unless I'm declaring war, getting them to declare war on other people, or negotiating peace.  I miss vassal states of civ 4. I miss the sense of building a real coalition of like minded cultures. BE has such a high potential for that, it would be a real shame if they didn't pursue that. I am really disappointed that over and over again, when they talk about diplomacy in BE, the only thing they talk about is how its missing the 'psychology' of being grounded in history. The problem is that diplomacy is totally useless. Without luxuries, diplomacy would be nearly useless in Civ 5 as well."
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,SmellThisMilk,3,Thu Mar 12 19:10:31 2015 UTC,"You hit several things on the head that I couldn't articulate when I was wondering why it felt so off.  They really should have your affinity play a role much more like it did in civ 4.  Now it's just another tick in the we hate or like you column and really it doesn't seem to have much effect.  I don't know how it's coded, but I'm guessing the size of the hit is based on the difference between your highest affinity and their affinity, which since the AI seems, in many cases, to ping pong around like a caffeinated Tigger.  Last game I played the AI factions all switched dominant affinity at least once, in one case three times.  Anyway the variance between your highest affinity and their affinity level of that type never seems great so the resulting impact is minimal.  I'd love to see Affinity Wars break out between factions, as it stands now that is unlikely.  I mean affinities are supposed to be a government, a way of life, and a religion all rolled into one it ought to be a huge deal.  I also know they didn't want to copy luxuries as such, but we need something more.  Something like variant strategic resources for affinites.  I'm not sure by various float stone ores, rare firaxite outcroppings, or strains of biomass.  Something that could act like a luxury did in the older games."
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,Caleth,6,Fri Mar 13 00:05:12 2015 UTC,"The ""Great Mistake"" of Beyond Earth was trying to be too much like Civ 5 rather than push some frankly ingenious concepts to their full potential.    Affinities, Quests, Exploration and Aliens - all of these fall flat.  Affinities make less an impact on how one plays than Ideologies despite being a central theme to the game.  Quests are rarely more interesting than research/ build something or excavate in one's territory. Nothing much to stir the pot and encourage faction competition.  Exploration grants nothing more than ruins and supply pods, both of which fall off majorly after the early game. I'm fine with luxury resources being removed, but with nothing taking their place the landscape feels bland and featureless.  Aliens, to my disappointment, won't swarm cities as a form of indirect warmongering for players riling them up. It's actually kind of hard to get them riled up without Mods, and the only real threat if they are is the occasional Siege Worm near a city.  This is far from an exclusive list of wasted potential.    I had high hopes for Civ Beyond Earth when it came up, but the flatness of the game made me as jaded as I was hopeful.  Unless it plays like an entirely different game - the game it could have been, not the game it is - I won't get my hopes up again."

civbeyondearth,2ysktv,wolfdreams01,2,Fri Mar 13 18:53:35 2015 UTC,"Got the winter update, nice bit of changes there. Wonders being the most obvious. I wonder what they'll do though in this ""2.0"" regarding diplomacy.   Will they get those voice actors back in the studio and record a shit load of lines or will they drastically improve the quests system. Maybe re-introduce unique units and structures. Maybe, hopefully, all of those things.   Maybe some unique quests for each faction regarding social issues that were still a problem back on Earth in order to give each faction leader a bigger background. The quest would end with you getting a national wonder that would boost their unique abilities. An interesting way to incorporate unique buildings units and anything else would be through a more intricate quest system."
civbeyondearth,2ysktv,Rieklin,3,Thu Mar 12 16:08:32 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of faction specific quests as a way to bring back national wonders. That would definitely go a long way to making me feel more personally connected to my faction, especially if the national wonder changed base don my affinity, or... was like some sort of RPG upgrade able palace?

The affinities were supposed to define how you played the game and the future of humanity, instead it was what resources you aim for and some nifty lore. I hope that they will be able to make these affinities feel and play like I am changing my civs future, and I think everything will fall into place."

I tried playing again after the Winter Patch, automated workers still bug out and have that problem where they just stand still when there's plenty of work to be done.  Also, there seem to be even fewer ways to deal with negative health, which is just bizarre to me.  I understand not everyone puts their workers on automation and prefer to micro-manage... but I still expect them to be able to build roads between cities when automated. All this does is convince me that the devs tried to port over the Civ 5 engine without making the necessary changes to adapt the AI."

I don't understand why anyone would automate their workers, those little fiends have betrayed me every time I tried it in III and IV.  I'm convinced they know what you want them to do, simply because they so consistently do the exact opposite.  Though it would be nice if they made it so you could tell workers and explorers to avoid the Miasma.  Stupid little dinguses will build a magrail straight through three tiles of Miasma-infested forest.  I mean, I could always grab that one Harmony tech, but still."

I'm so happy to have the opportunity to share this and I hope everyone enjoys. Please leave any feedback on how things can be improved or ideas you might have as well!

I couldn't even see going for it if I had the tech and the spare Firaxite.
civbeyondearth,2ypy7n,Ridry,6,Thu Mar 12 11:45:22 2015 UTC,"I never even built it for the culture per turn. It was always for the two free virtues. 7 culture per turn is nice and all but by the time you can BUILD this thing you need thousands of culture points per virtue. 7 isn't going to make THAT big of a dent. Now it doesn't even give that. As you said, you need 21 people to get 7. So the city that gets it will need to have extremely high growth to make it worth it, which will probably mean it's production isn't the greatest.   And now it costs 4 firaxite as well?

On my account, only 8 of the 29 wonders were made more desirable, and of those 8, perhaps only 6 are viable.     All in all: Good job Firaxis for diversifying what the wonders can do. Please, please make them good now. They're just as bad as they were (if not worse) than before the patch."

civbeyondearth,2ypy7n,Velrei,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:21:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I really like the effects they provide, each wonder has a clear niche and function now and feels more ""wonderful"" than before.  The exact numbers they provide? Firaxis seems to approach them from a rather conservative angle, preferring wonders to be too weak over too strategy-defining, which isn't a worse approach than approaching them from the other end."
civbeyondearth,2ypy7n,Velrei,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:25:39 2015 UTC,"My problem with Wonders was that they always took too many turns to build.  The opportunity cost of instead building military units and rolling domination is too high.  With increased ""bolts"" (or nuts, or hammers, or industry) on a lot of the wonders, the opportunity cost just gets higher.  They also added in a strategic resource cost to a lot of the wonders which just raises the opportunity cost of building military units.    The problem is that I play with Humans more often than AI.  I often find myself in a situation where I am strategic resource starved for at least one type and the one I have an ""abundance"" of has dictated my affinity.  This means that I must save my ""abundance"" for military units.  Humans generally will not trade strategic resources, so if I want the other resource, I have to take it by force.  As with any Civ game, if I am able to take a city by force, odds are I can just continue the pain train.  All roads lead to building military units and domination victory.  I feel like I'm missing something.  Is there an overall balance they are establishing that I just can't see?"
civbeyondearth,2ypy7n,Katamariguy,2,Thu Mar 12 16:40:09 2015 UTC,If you classify each wonder as pertaining to a particular affinity (or being neutral) and then compare that with the resources they require:     4 require the same resource as the affinity most likely to have teched it.  6 require a different resource than the affinity most likely to have teched it.  7 require no affinity resource.  8 require geothermal.  4 require affinity resource and are neutrally situated on the tech web.
civbeyondearth,2ypy7n,boxtears,3,Thu Mar 12 20:37:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting that they went the route of using other strategic resources with wonders, which is useful in that it gives us some way of using those without being part of that affinity. Although with wonders that already function to be part of the same affinity as the resource being used it seems to increase the problem of running out of strategic resources of the kind you actually need. I very rarely end up using Xenomass for military units since I require so much of it for affinity buildings, when I end up not playing Harmony I run into the same sort of issue. I generally tend to expand and turtle up rather then going on the offensive unless it's vital to stop a planetary wonder victory. Or they just happened to spawn too close to me."
civbeyondearth,2ypy7n,Zoythrus,2,Thu Mar 12 00:35:25 2015 UTC,"I also agree that it's genuinely quite interesting. I don't really know how I feel about it quite yet -- but I can say this. If (for example) I want to build the Drone Sphere and need 1 floatstone to do so, I like that it forces me to (as a Harmony player) have Terraforming first before I can get the Drone Sphere. I have no issue with that. My only concern is that given that I have to deviate to terraforming to build the Drone Sphere -- it (and all the wonders) should be very good, just to serve an interesting niche role that could become the heart of a strategy. Right now, they're just not. -- and not to pick on the Drone Sphere. It's actually one of the few I think is quite good."
civbeyondearth,2ypy7n,3ntf4k3d,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:42:09 2015 UTC,Well.... it doesn't when you think about it. You could trade for the resource to get it faster (perhaps indefinitely).

That's awful specific.  I can't see this being very useful except in a city near the border with another faction... which isn't likely to have the production capacity to finish a wonder like this very quickly."
civbeyondearth,2ypy7n,AndytheNewby,1 point,Thu Mar 12 23:36:39 2015 UTC,"Well, that plus the Mass Driver would keep your capital safe from attacks. Also, I'd build it to make sure no one else could."
civbeyondearth,2ypy7n,viper459,2,Fri Mar 13 04:04:09 2015 UTC,"Many of these wonders have actually become less useful with the winter patch.  The only wonders that were actually powerful enough to warrant construction most of the time (Gene Vault and Ectogenesis Pod) have been neutered and the addition of extra ressource requirements has made a beeline for wonders less desireable.  Also take note that many wonders are currently broken. The Quantum Computer doesn't work at all, and someone on the CIVfanatics forums has reported that this also applies to the Promethian. Apart from that there are tooltip errors (Ectogenesis Pod is 0.2 food per pop, not 0.25), so an in-deep inspection of the XML files is needed to verify the actual values listed by the OP."
civbeyondearth,2ypy7n,ATG77,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"In essence, this is just furthering my case that the winter patch has made wonders even worse -- even though it has certainly diversified them."
civbeyondearth,2ypy7n,Zoythrus,2,Tue Mar 17 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"Yes and yes.  But to be fair: When I made my ""Better Wonders"" mod I quickly noticed that wonders in CIV:BE are actually a really tricky subject and way harder to balance than in CIV5.  You have the tech web, which makes it a lot easier to beeline for wonders, so you can't really estimate at which point the player gets his/her hands on a wonder. Ressource requirements can mitigate that somewhat, but then you introduce randomness because a player might not have access to the required ressources - and while you always have the AI as a trade partner in SP games, you might completely upset the balance for MP players.  Then you have the game pacing: When I was still using Terrascape spam shortly after release, I actually grabbed quite a few wonders, mostly because my games went on for 350+ turns. But now I end the game around turn 240 or so (225 pre-patch) when I play my Harmony+Academy strategy. I usually never build wonders anymore, but rather convert science or food because that is more effective in terms of reaching the finish line.   In a way that is also a problem related to the win conditions for Affinity victories. To make a wonder viable in that case it would have to: (a) be directly on my tech path and (b) give me enough advantage to compensate for the build cost. If (a) isn't true, a wonder needs to more or less grant a free tech to be viable for an Affinity victory. Which is pretty insane, because if you look at CIV5, you have only a handful of wonders that have that scientific potential. I fear as long as the Affinity victories are not changed, you would either have to overpower wonders significantly to make them viable or you'd have to give them some sort of ""free affinity points"" (which would speed up the game even more).  And lastely you also need to take the Virtue trees into account. Any player that goes for Industry can spam Manufactories to create a massive production city, which, as a sidenote, is possible because the health/happiness system is not balanced well. Under these circumstances, how can you even balance out the cost for a wonder?  Notice how many mechanics actually tie into that problem? Yeah, it's a mess...  Still, I can't even comprehend what they tried to do with these wonder changes. Yes, wonders are more unique - but that does not matter if you will never ever build them.  [edit: typos]"
civbeyondearth,2ypy7n,attackofthe50ftpanda,3,Wed Mar 18 07:58:33 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty pleased with most of these, honestly.

I think this is why Cruisers start out with 2 range, as well.  Otherwise, it would be trivial to bombard cities from range then swoop in from outside their counter-attack range with a melee ship. Instead, you need to have either hover tanks or risk sending embarked units, which have a penalty for amphibious attacks. Either way, you have to make more of an investment into amphibious captures than you would have in Civ 5, where you basically just need to upgrade a +Range Frigate or build a Battleship and keep around just a single Caravel/Ironclad/Destroyer for captures."

Now embarked units can attack from the sea and invade a city, however you'll need a battleship to cover them on the same tile as a city and it's ranged defenders / planes can kill an embarked unit like it ain't nothing. Either this or moved the embarked unit to land a safe distance from the city, but then you  need to be aware of the tile movement cost and that unit will still be susceptible to bombardment.  Once you have top upgraded Combat Rovers they'll all have levitate over terrain perk so it becomes much easier to just fly them across the ocean and not have to worry about embarking."
civbeyondearth,2ye61d,akikosan,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:50:46 2015 UTC,My friend and I were talking about how they should add in the privateer type ships. It's kind of boring only having one naval vessel. Also no submarines? Did we forget about those when we came over to the new world?
civbeyondearth,2ye61d,DefiantMars,1 point,Mon Mar 9 19:02:32 2015 UTC,"Technically there are 2 types of ships, the Gunboat and the Carrier... but the Carrier doesn't really count. Just having 1 more type of ship would be enough, since all units diverge into 3 different sub-units."

Quest chains etc.   More thought behind aliens. Not just the standard barbarians. Some sort of variance in what aliens exist on this planet. One game night have primitive aliens, other planets, intelligent life, some even have existing civs that you need to coexist with. Aliens as they are now are kinda lazily designed in my opinion...   Beyond Earth have such potential. The concepts are nice, but in the end it's pretty much the same as civ 5. Properly fleshed out, this could have been one of those rare gems that never grow old."

This could simply be the map for signing up for that Firaxis connectivity service, or it could be something more substantial.  I like the idea of more interaction between civs through the World Congress.  I'd change it to quest lines that require interactions between civs that affect the planet rather than something straight from BNW.  The world quests can add lore and make the planet feel alive.  A return of luxury resources I think should be explored as well.  Again, I would rather the devs experiment with different trading systems, in case there's a better system possible for Civ VI."

Heck, even if all the other players are Purity / Supremacy, it still takes way to long to spread miasma on all the tiles you want. It's really not practical for an invading force. Particularly if the opponent has satellites that will prevent you from spreading your condensers."
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,PM_ME_CHIMICHANGAS,8,Mon Mar 9 14:08:05 2015 UTC,"I think you're right about might for domination-style games, but I feel like you overlook the culture and health bonuses in the knowledge tree. I like to build 5 into knowledge first before getting into might for the discount on new policies, and come back later for the lowered penalty for new cities and bonus health per 6 pop. With the lack of aggresive AI I never really feel pressure to focus pure might/keep up in affinities until I decide I'm ready to go to war."
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,PM_ME_CHIMICHANGAS,3,Sun Mar 8 16:44:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by lack of aggressive AI, in my experience the AI will aggro as soon as they run out of space to expand which happens fairly quickly on Apollo.   Health is barely a concern honestly. My last game I ended with nearly -250 health from my original 5 cities and the 30-40 I puppeted as I wiped out my enemies. It really doesn't impact the game that much.  I think my main concern with the knowledge tree is that on Apollo no matter how much science / culture you're generating the AI tends to be ahead of you."
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,PM_ME_CHIMICHANGAS,1 point,Sun Mar 8 16:52:14 2015 UTC,"I haven't played much on Apollo actually, didn't realize the difficulty would change AI behavior aside from the bonuses they're given. I tend to play slightly wide I suppose, because I find I need to place at least a secondary focus on health in the mid-game to keep growth at a good pace. Health figures in the end game are hardly relevant though, once every city has soma distilleries it's a non-factor, but as I expand past 5 or 6 cities the health virtues are quite nice. The real benefit of the knowedge tree though is the bonus to beakers/pages. Every tree has a health virtue, the one in knowledge just happens to be one of the better ones."
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,corathus59,2,Sun Mar 8 17:24:22 2015 UTC,I guess as a warmonger I just don't see the value in health. I still have decent production numbers across all my cities and earn science at a reasonable rate so no matter how low in the negatives I go I've just never worried about it.   I guess that's one of the perks of having 50+ cities though.
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,Drake55645,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:31:02 2015 UTC,"Well my last game was on a massive map with a few very nice strategic choke points outlining my area, so I mostly turtled and only warmongered at the end for fun once I already had a victory pretty much wrapped up. But even when I'm going full warmonger, when I've got neighbors who need taking care of early, I try my best not to neglect infrastructure at home, usually by slowing down the warmachine post-conquest until I can get back on track health-wise. The bonuses to all aspects of your empire are pretty nice past 20+ net health. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but its at least 10% iirc. Every beaker counts when you're rushing a wonder, or phasal transporters."
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,ZenBS,2,Sun Mar 8 20:12:44 2015 UTC,It just seems all so unnecessary to me. The only buildings I put up in cities are the ones that increase production to pump units out faster. As for science and culture I get plenty of it from the puppeted cities I conquer.

civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,ZenBS,7,Wed Mar 11 15:27:20 2015 UTC,"I would highly dispute your best virtue track.  I've found that Industry seems to be out and away the most useful, though Prosperity is nearly tied.  Consider, Industry nets you the following:  +10% Production towards buildings  +.2 Health per building  +6 energy per station tier, per station  +.5 Health for every trade unit  +25% production for buildings already in the capital  +15% production for Wonders  +2 Production per Manufactory  +1 Energy per Basic resource  +1% of total stockpiled Energy (up to 100 per turn)  +.5 Production per tile per Population  -20% to purchase units  And those are just the ones I consistently use.  Industry is amazing for Energy, Production, and Health - literally the only ones it doesn't benefit are Culture and Science.  Remember, Health benefits all those stats, and Energy/Production can be converted to Culture and Science very easily.  Prosperity, meanwhile, is ""solving health issues: the Virtue Tree,"" and also gets you some pretty great bonuses to production as well as faster workers, two free units, extra Expeditions, overpowered Terrascapes, and extra population in new cities.  Even if I'm not emphasizing it, I almost always beeline towards T3 Prosperity to get Ecoscaping, and I always get Pathfinders along the way as well.  Don't get me wrong, Might doesn't get enough love, and its synergy with Brasilia is amazing, but all things considered I'd call Industry the best overall tree.  One thing re: Purity, even when going Domination I always just make it a point to settle at least one city on any continents.  Even if it's just a crappy piece of tundra or something, it's still a city with orbital coverage, and with the Industry bonuses I easily have the Energy and Production to make it a perfectly serviceable military outpost."
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,ZenBS,3,Mon Mar 9 03:00:44 2015 UTC,I've pretty much given up the idea of using outposts myself because Phasal Transporter is just stupidly powerful. I find that my average wide civilization has enough orbital range to dump my units wherever I need them. For late game mop up it's worth it to get those 6 dots in Supremacy just for the Firaxite coverage.
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,think_once_more,2,Mon Mar 9 14:36:42 2015 UTC,Wow I'm a dunce aren't I? For whatever reason I've never really thought about going Purity and just splashing into Supremacy for fireaxite coverage. That would solve a lot.
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,Mao-C,3,Mon Mar 9 14:45:44 2015 UTC,"There's a few other benefits to blending Affinities in Late Game: You sometimes have a faster route to the Ultimate Form upgrade of units by grabbing now-cheap techs and some of the Evolved/Whatever mix units get benefits I prefer to the ""True"" variants."
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,ilikecchiv,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:29:42 2015 UTC,"It's not hard to do, either, and there's several very worthwhile Supremacy techs.  I usually end up with 3 or 4 points in Supremacy anyway just to get those sweet, sweet terraforming satellites, and the early buildings are always handy as well.  Generally I don't tend to find myself lacking orbital coverage anyway - it's usually worth it to take the extra orbital range on various buildings, and dropping an outpost on a continent means I can typically reach about a third of it on an average-size landmass for the Transporters."
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,Yulong,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:50:32 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing though: Health is nearly insignificant Yeah the -10% cutbacks on most of your production values seem like a lot, but I never really felt like it impacted my game on a whole.  I had anywhere from 20-50 cities throughout the game and a total of -250 health. My science and culture generation was fine (I suppose just through the sheer number of cities I had) and in my non puppeted cities I never bother building anything but production buildings.   I love Industry though and it's usually the one I dabble in after I complete might. If I were to avoid might entirely I would probably just pump everything into Industry (with an exception for a couple of the good techs in Prosperity)"
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,ilikecchiv,3,Mon Mar 9 14:13:27 2015 UTC,"I find that the might tree is only so valuable in the late game, but the late game never happens. I've won by then."
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,ilikecchiv,0,Sun Mar 8 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"The main reason I'm so big on the Might tree is I just feel as though the other trees are relatively useless.   Health is irrelevant  (I finished the last game with -250 health) so prosperity doesn't help that much beyond early expansion. The knowledge tree just seems all around useless to me. Industry is great but only for the gold bonuses for buying units. I never have problem meeting production needs regardless.  Being able to capture others outpost is an incredible way of shutting down your neighbor and expanding at the same time. I really see no reason to not take this. Sure you can just send out colonist, but if you're not capturing your neighbors outpost then eventually you'll run out of space. This guarantees you have more room to start initially."
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,ilikecchiv,3,Sun Mar 8 23:27:25 2015 UTC,"Those are some excellent benefits but I still stand by the Africa/Culture/Prosperity combo. 8th turn colonist gives you a ridiculous leg up. Liberation Army is really useful but the fact that I can't then burn captured outposts the AI opponent put in irritating places means that I generally avoid it. Which probably has more to do with me being picky about city placement and disliking ICS than anything else, so YMMdefinitelyV."
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,larknok1,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:42:03 2015 UTC,ICS   Hmmm hadn't heard of this before. I typically spread cities out in order to allow them the maximum amount of room for individual improvements. This is interesting I'll have to look into it.  How do you mean Culture? What does a culture centric game look like in BE? I want to understand because I've wanted to play one but never do very well.
civbeyondearth,2ycf5d,larknok1,2,Mon Mar 9 14:48:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, nothing pisses me off more than the AI dumping their crap outposts in my yard.  Culture isn't really a winning strategy by itself-you're using it to get a jump on game changer virtues in the early game. I'm no master at the tactic myself but the combo of Africa/Artists is huge. I generally jump out of Prosperity after Colony Initiative into whatever other virtue seems appropriate to the situation, returning to it when my health starts taking a hit for Mind Over Matter."

Send out some explorers and find the less developed cities if you want to do higher intrigue missions."
civbeyondearth,2yctw6,tobascodagama,9,Sun Mar 8 19:13:11 2015 UTC,Also look for cities that already have elevated intrigue. That indicates someone else has a spy there. Your combined ops will raise intrigue much faster than what either of you could achieve alone.
civbeyondearth,2yctw6,Mr_Industrial,3,Sun Mar 8 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"That is a good point. I often play on smaller maps (4 civs usually), just because on larger maps it tends to take forever for the game to process each turn."

civbeyondearth,2yctw6,randomguy000039,2,Mon Mar 9 03:06:51 2015 UTC,"Espionage is useful in that you can steal some energy/science and occasionally steal some techs if you are lucky.  Anything beyond that seems mostly impossible, out of 10 games or so I only had 1 game where I had intrigue levels high enough that I could do a coup d'etat and that was playing with ARC on very easy.

civbeyondearth,2y9qvd,donblas,9,Sat Mar 7 20:19:48 2015 UTC,"You capture one of the major issues with the gameplay -- lack of feeling involved in global affairs.  For whatever it's worth, I provided a potential solution that still gave players freedom to choose what they want to do with my concept of Affinity Tug-of-War. Check it out here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/civbeyondearth/comments/2rqqk5/xpack_idea_affinity_tugofwar/"
civbeyondearth,2y9qvd,larknok1,8,Sat Mar 7 20:41:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed that tech centric affinity is a culprit.    If Aliens were a real threat early and later on I think they would do much to spice up the game.  Before release I thought I would be able to attack and rile them up to get them to attack all other players as a sort of indirect warmongering sabotage early game, but they just don't swarm cities like I had hoped.  If Harmony could somehow power them up later and gain them as an ally that would be a legitimate threat to other factions, it would give a game-play reason for Harmony to want to defend them while the other affinities want to destroy them.    I also think more dynamic quests that actually create conflict would be a good idea.  Things on neutral ground to capture and hold for a time could be a good direction;  and generally I'd like to see more fighting over expeditions.    Quite awhile ago I had an idea for a Devotions system that would drastically change how one's affinity affects their infrastructure.  It would be unlocked fastest by Culture with Science as a secondary unlock tool.  The core purpose behind it would be to make Affinity choice have a huge impact on how one plays the game, and I would also like affinity military units to be more distinct with more and earlier innate traits separating them.    I'd also like to see world wars break out somehow, most likely along Affinity lines.  I suggested a Federations formal alliances system long ago to try to encourage this - with some risk of backstabbing to keep things interesting."
civbeyondearth,2y9qvd,Galgus,6,Sat Mar 7 23:22:30 2015 UTC,"I suppose that Civ V kept coming up with new game mechanics to spice things up late-game, and BE just gives you new units, buildings, and improvements."
civbeyondearth,2y9qvd,Katamariguy,1 point,Sun Mar 8 04:20:41 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer, IMO. In Civ 5 (with BNW), each victory was won through very different means, and as a result, the game felt much different depending on which victory you were shooting for and which your opponents favored.  I think they were probably going for something similar with the tech web - opening up vastly different paths based on affinity - but it's so open, so non-intuitive, that the later game just ends up feeling the same regardless."

civbeyondearth,2y9qvd,gorbachev,2,Tue Mar 10 03:14:31 2015 UTC,There are some good points here. I think there's another big late-game factor that BE is missing... Nukes! Nukes have the important role of checking a late game boom towards the science victories.  Nukes provide a viable late-game spoil strategy for Civs that are lagging behind. The nuclear race also provides an interesting late game diplomatic bargaining chip that's currently missing.
civbeyondearth,2y9qvd,Robolenin,2,Sun Mar 8 04:05:30 2015 UTC,"Nukes seem to devolve the game into spamming them: I think conventional warfare would be more fun.  Then again I play Marathon, where armies traverse continents at a reasonable rate of time relative to the rate of tech and building."
civbeyondearth,2y9qvd,Galgus,2,Sun Mar 8 10:53:57 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go ahead and compare to SMAC: Real factions.  BE lacks any sort of real faction. Every faction wants the same things, varying only by affinity, and even then most affinities are not opposed - only purity hates the others, and only if it attempts to save earth. SMAC had real factions with ideological differences reflected in different approaches to dealing with their societies, which meant huge differences in what were effective approaches to dealing with planet.  Sometimes, restrictions are good. Maybe a refugee ship should not be permitted to conquer Earth - it would just inspire a revolt and so any leader attempting to do would be deposed immediately. An noble colony, meanwhile, sees no reason to save the huddling masses back on earth."
civbeyondearth,2y9qvd,OtherSpiderOnTheWall,2,Sun Mar 8 08:13:41 2015 UTC,"Another problem in addition to the points you mention is a total lack of need for diplomacy. I can win on the highest difficulty levels without once making a trade deal. In fact, I find I avoid them actively. In Civ V, you need trade deals to stay afloat, catch up, and eventually surpass the AI.       Another thing about Civ:BE I dislike is the lack of victory results. I like going through and seeing the statistics at the end. A victory picture followed by the main menu is just not rewarding."
civbeyondearth,2y9qvd,dancing_cucumber,2,Sun Mar 8 11:45:49 2015 UTC,To me there's plenty of tension in Beyond Earth so long as you're playing on the maximum difficulty. I always do military centric games (really I think that's the only way to play Beyond Earth) so I have plenty of enemies on my continent that I'm preoccupied with eliminating early game.  Mid to late game becomes a race to establish power on the secondary continent and preventing the AI from winning their affinity victories. On Apollo they do this relatively quickly so you have to wage war on pretty  much everyone at once in order to stop them from winning. It can get pretty insane.
civbeyondearth,2y9qvd,AlaskanSkunkBear,1 point,Sun Mar 8 15:54:38 2015 UTC,Spot. On.
civbeyondearth,2yaxfk,come-on-now-please,7,Sun Mar 8 03:07:22 2015 UTC,They do vanish if nobody trades with them.  Generally I nab the Industry +6 energy/station tier bonus and the game turns into a race against the clock to open up a trade route with every station before they disappear.
civbeyondearth,2yaxfk,Drake55645,5,Sun Mar 8 04:05:57 2015 UTC,"Could have been due to alien attacks, or the ai."
civbeyondearth,2yaxfk,OldYeti,3,Sun Mar 8 03:10:20 2015 UTC,"I already was the only player left on the map, and there were no aliens on map either, I destroyed every nest and build over top of them(I basically controlled ALL the land at this point) so the only aliens that could spawn were the ocean bound ones"
civbeyondearth,2yaxfk,OldYeti,4,Sun Mar 8 03:12:58 2015 UTC,"The civilopedia makes it sound like they can just leave, I guess if no one is trading with them: ""When colonial expansion or lack of trading opportunities brought hardship to the station masters, they were not averse to moving on."""
civbeyondearth,2yaxfk,KillAllTheThings,5,Sun Mar 8 03:20:45 2015 UTC,If no one trades with a station it will go away (usually leaving a settlement site you can send an explorer to).   This happens to me often at the beginning of a game when there are too many alien nests between the station and my city.
civbeyondearth,2yaxfk,Cleaningcaptain,2,Sun Mar 8 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, stations have an odd tendency to set up near alien nests, or behind a wall of miasma."

civbeyondearth,2y8nrc,DefiantMars,5,Sat Mar 7 21:29:53 2015 UTC,"I was literally furious that there was no volcanic map on launch.   I had heard about how civ V was the same way back when it originally released compared to IV, but holy fuck talk about wasted opportunities.  Every idea here sounds awesome. Especially the different alien types. Its extremely annoying seeing the exact same aliens spawning out of a desert nest as would spawn out of a rain forest one or a tundra one. They don't even have the decency to give them different colors. I want more alien types.  In the same way, I want more military units. Harmony especially. Yay, I get to ride the aliens. Except not drones, and aliens still attack me. And being friendly with aliens doesn't actually do anything other than stopping them from attacking me, and I have to waste a xenomass source since I can't build buildings on it.  I also want more resources and more diplomacy. I can't even tell AI to stop attacking trade stations.   I like this game a lot, but holy hell it just doesn't feel complete. That interview that released was completely right and I'm glad they realized it. In attempting not to alienate the established playerbase they just didn't innovate enough."
civbeyondearth,2y8nrc,Archfiendrai,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:35:55 2015 UTC,"These are all amazing ideas. They should try to implement the Alien Strains mod, too. That adds variations like the Basilisk Manticore, or the Raptor Charger, the latter which does pretty much what you suggested for the rhino alien.  I think another good idea would be a true rainforest type; e.g. jungle forests that look similar to the terrascape, greenish-brown water, overgrown grasslands and grassy plains, maybe with the occasional tree scattered about, and deserts that more resemble scrublands. Probably have some stationary man-eating plant style aliens, too.  Or how about a sickly poisonous dying world, with wilting trees and glowing radiation veins in the earth? Maybe units could get poisoned from miasma there taking damage over time, and have it be more yellowish like fallout."
civbeyondearth,2y8nrc,LyraHeartstrlngs,3,Sun Mar 8 01:10:37 2015 UTC,Perhaps add it so aliens can have different hives and attack eachother if they enter the territory of another hive? I always found it strange how in civ 5 Groups of murdering pillaging barbarians would always get along.

civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,Russeru,13,Fri Mar 6 13:08:45 2015 UTC,"This is what I've thought since the beginning. Civ V had practically nothing when it started, and now look at it. I figured they would add more content to BE as it went on as well."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,echolog,11,Fri Mar 6 20:20:28 2015 UTC,"And to think, all it took was two full priced expansions!"

civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,Big_Cums,3,Sat Mar 7 09:44:43 2015 UTC,"Eh, I still like it. It's a nice change if nothing else. Even if you play 5 games of Civ V and 1 game of BE in-between."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,echolog,1 point,Sat Mar 7 10:51:40 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think BE is a good game for what it is. Is it lacking in some ways, especially in comparison to Civ 5? Yeah, sure, but BE has it's own charm and nice additions that make it an enjoyable, albeit incomplete, game."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,Antonne,22,Tue Mar 17 13:41:52 2015 UTC,"can turn things around like they did with vanilla Civ 5.   People seem to forget this. Civ 5 was not nearly as good now as it was at release. Hell, it wasn't until Brave New World that the game felt complete for me. Sure that meant paying more to a studio that can fix their issues rather than one that idly sits on their hands and rakes in money (I'm looking at you EA)."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,VulcanSithLord,31,Fri Mar 6 18:05:55 2015 UTC,Civ 5 was not nearly as good now as it was at release   I think you got that the wrong way round mate.
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,SergeantJezza,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:33:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I'm missing something in your statement there, but I would agree that Civ 5 wasn't nearly as good at release. It was still a solid game, as I think BE is, but they were / are both weak at release. Civ 5 now is an amazingly complete-feeling game to me, whereas BE misses something. Civ 5 didn't get there until Brave New World for me."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,Antonne,2,Tue Mar 17 13:40:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree, the guy I replied to got it the wrong way round, saying it is worse now than at release"
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,SergeantJezza,7,Tue Mar 17 13:51:03 2015 UTC,"They can still make it a great game, but not with paid expansions. We deserve free DLC that completes the game because so far, the game is unfinished. They need to add more lore to the game, natural wonders, animations for the country leaders, tweak the difficulty, smarten up the AI and improve the interface. It really has the potential to be a classic and my favorite Civ game, but it's missing so much."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,Jay21310,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"A lot of this could've been sorted out if they'd only held an open beta, like they now admit they should've done.  Yeah we would've had to wait longer for the release, but it would've been worth it.  Also, people forget that there are core problems that can't easily be fixed without a complete do over.  For example, it's very noticeable when the AI is bugging out because it still thinks it's playing Civ 5 and can't gel with even the slightest changes in mechanics."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,boxtears,0,Sat Mar 7 02:06:48 2015 UTC,"Yes sure thats nice, but you are aware we'll be paying like $90+ for a game that could have been done at $50"
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,MewKazami,47,Fri Mar 6 22:54:35 2015 UTC,"Just like vanilla Civ 5 vs. what we have today, BE can still be an immersive, polished game. They really shouldn't give up on it."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,inhalingsounds,48,Fri Mar 6 12:00:11 2015 UTC,"I still feel that BE in its current state is much more enjoyable than V was at launch.  The good news is the article confirms they're still treating BE as a ""live"" project, so hopefully they can work some of their more audacious ideas into an expansion."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,McSqueeb,20,Fri Mar 6 12:20:31 2015 UTC,"That is how I feel. I've enjoyed the game consistently since launch, but I am not beyond admitting the game has some problems (though it doesn't have as many problems as most would lead one to believe). It is encouraging to hear that they are still officially treating it as a ""live"" game, and hearing that the leads feel the same way we (the players) do means that the 1, 2, or even 3+ expansions to the game will truly make it something special.    Or at least, that is what I hope."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,leandrombraz,7,Fri Mar 6 13:11:36 2015 UTC,"If an expansion really happens, I hope they got that boldness they admittedly lacked and are doing some really crazy stuff on it."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,McSqueeb,8,Fri Mar 6 14:10:28 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for two things from any expansions. I don't care if they add one in a first, and the second in a second, but I want to see both of these added:     More variation and specialization in the affinities. I really like the change in look and the change in some of the unit strategy given the associated upgrades. However I would like to have more of a fundamental difference shown between the three. More factions. I think this one is obvious. I would like to see an expansion on the Earth Factions to fill in the areas that are not covered by the existing factions. Also, I'd like to see a few truly ""alien"" factions. I think having a few alien factions would be nice, and they can have their own variation on the affinities while still being functionally the same. For example the ""alien supremacy"" could be an evolution of the Borg wanting to assimilate the human race, or ""alien purity"" can be a variation of the invasion aliens from ID4 wanting to eradicate humanity in favor of their own ideology.   At the end of the day, as long as they ""go bigger"" it should turn out positively. Because if you look at BE objectively it is a good game, it just isn't what we expected given the quality and strategic range of the titles that came before."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,leandrombraz,2,Fri Mar 6 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"I wonder how Starships cross-connectivity with BE will affect the possibility of new factions. I mean, if Starships can import BE saves, this mean that Starships need to have all the factions you have on your BE save. So if they add new factions to BE, this mean we get this factions on Starships as well? This might get a little trick for them to figure out how to do it, since I doubt anyone will be happy buying new faction on BE, them having to buy it again on Starships to keep cross-connectivity fully functional. They would need to make it free on starships or something like that."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,McSqueeb,3,Fri Mar 6 15:05:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they should or shouldn't do this, just that it is possible to do in a technical manner.    They could include all the new Civ:BE factions in a patch in Starships so Starships supports them when they come from a Civ:BE save, but are not available otherwise. They could then also have DLC for Starships to unlock them natively within Starships.    Games such as Borderlands and Europa Universalis do this with their DLC patches. The support for the content is included, but the actual content is still ""locked"" until you buy your ""DLC Key"" (for lack of a better term)."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,serael,2,Fri Mar 6 15:11:02 2015 UTC,"Just gonna throw this out there. Didn't buy starships don't give a fuck about starships. They need to add more to the game we paid for, and saying ""but cross connectivity to our other paid game stalls us on providing you more content"" is such a poor excuse."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,Fishtacoburrito,2,Sat Mar 7 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"One thing I'd really like to see is the ability to create animated faction leaders. Granted if your XML-fu is strong, you can create entire factions (I've done so in Civ5) but I always felt having to use a wallpaper backdrop to represent the leader while the others are animated hurt immersion."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,McSqueeb,3,Fri Mar 6 17:05:21 2015 UTC,"While I don't create any mods myself, I have wanted to experiment (especially to create a Civ V strategic-like UI for my low-end system). I agree that it breaks the immersion a lot when it hits like that... but perhaps a short term fix could be to include 2D or non-animated versions of the current leaders so they look like the mod ones until the tools exist to better create animated mod leaders?"
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,Fishtacoburrito,3,Fri Mar 6 17:11:54 2015 UTC,"That would be a nice workaround provided you can find 2D art that properly represents your civ.  What killed my interested in BE was basically what they admitted in the article about the leaders being rather plain (especially when compared to historical leaders). If they provided an engine that let us easily create our own civs, I would be all over this game.   Not saying anything I created would be more interesting and compelling than what they created but there would be a greater level familiarity and connection in playing as and against my own creations or the creations of other users.  At least for me."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,McSqueeb,2,Fri Mar 6 20:53:34 2015 UTC,I see what you mean now. Something kind of like the Endless Space Faction Creator? It lets you pick traits and aspects of your faction based on a maximum point value.
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,Goldenkrow,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:04:37 2015 UTC,"Sadly I dont think much will happen, the engine seems to really hold them back, here's hoping future engines allows a bit more flexibility"
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,stanley_twobrick,-9,Sun Mar 8 18:47:22 2015 UTC,That's because it's basically just a Civ 5 mod. If it was as shitty as 5 was at launch that would be impressively bad.
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,Igual_Mente,4,Fri Mar 6 14:24:41 2015 UTC,Have they said anything about expansion plans? I really don't want them to give up on this game. It has so much potential.
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,geryon84,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:52:31 2015 UTC,I'd love an answer to this as well! I mildly enjoyed Civ 5 at release... then loved it with some expansions.  Though I'm deeply interested in Beyond Earth... I've held off until it got an expansion or two.  Is there any news on any xpacs or is it dead in the water?
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,0x0000ff,8,Sat Mar 7 05:29:23 2015 UTC,"I disagree with any comparison to Civ 5 at launch.  The game was underdone in every aspect and the article really seems off to me - It wasn't about alienating the existing audience - everyone went berserk thinking there would be a new SMAC.  The problem was it was half assed.  YOU ARE WINNER.  Thanks for the little pic, what an accomplishment.    I was going to write a big list of the issues with the game compared to the quality expected from a Civ title but there's no point, there's so many quality issues just listing the problems confuses me, how could they get this so wrong after so many years of people ACHING for a spiritual successor to SMAC ??  Congrats, you built a wonder.  Congrats, you lost the game.  It's like the entire budget was spent on the intro FMV and then the game was given to a tiny team while everyone high fived over how excited the public was about this great new title!  Obviously, i'm in that group of people who bought it and was so utterly disappointed I struggle to even think of wanting to play it again.  Not only that but it was fucking $90 here in Australia.  Bringing this all the way back -- Civ 5 at launch was quite broken but it was still at least a feature rich game with all the depth and quality you would expect from a Civ game at launch.  I was pissed that I couldn't play hot seat, I was pissed that the game struggled on my brand new computer past turn 150, there were lots of issues -- but the game felt like people actually put time and effort into it.   The game had an aura of quality."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,Ridry,13,Fri Mar 6 13:01:26 2015 UTC,"The intro FMV was soooooooo good, and the first couple of quests that set the tone for affinity were so interesting. The things for the explorer to find (the beacons and the expeditions) seemed cool and planning your game out (affinity/virtue/etc) based on your landing location and what looked to be available is great fun.   After the first 100 turns the game's fun level decreases and the lackluster endings are just a perfect cap to what was a steadily decreasing experience.  I've not yet played Civ 4/5, but I'm a long time Civ player back from 1-3 and Alpha Centuri and I can tell you that Civ 3 (to use an example) was really cool as you progressed through the ages and the late game wonders were cool enough to be worth gunning for. There were EXCITING things to shoot for mid-late game. I just feel like most of the excitement in BE is in the first 100 turns."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,crasher_pt,1 point,Fri Mar 6 13:54:14 2015 UTC,"I think what you and others are complaining about when comparing BE to Civ V is that until Civ V PC gaming hadn't seen a feature-rich 4x in a long time. There was fun in exploring the novelty in new mechanics that they came up for it, the trees, 1upt etc. And since BE is basically the same thing, that novelty is simply gone and the fun factor even for the first playthrough goes down the drain, because it somehow feels like a second playthrough."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,inhalingsounds,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:37:05 2015 UTC,"Indeed - I really don't want to compare them with EA, but it feels like BE is to Civ 4 what the new SimCity was to its predecessors. Devs (well, most likely not devs but ...) all around are forgetting that the purpose of gaming is to play a game, not to look at it nor count how many social features it has. The magic is gone. Thank god for indie devs"
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,SteroyJenkins,3,Fri Mar 6 15:46:15 2015 UTC,I was able to enjoy and play civ 5 out of the box. This game however...

civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,Susarian,21,Fri Mar 6 16:12:20 2015 UTC,Please do not give up on this game. Please continue to update it to address the issues you already have identified. I believe it can still be redeemed.
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,Zoythrus,8,Fri Mar 6 13:39:17 2015 UTC,I am in full agreement with this statement.
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,SteroyJenkins,77,Fri Mar 6 18:01:24 2015 UTC,For me the game is missing a lot. I haven't touched it since the week it came out.  I might fire it up this weekend but the default UI depresses me.
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,BFoskett,35,Fri Mar 6 11:26:51 2015 UTC,"the default UI depresses me.   This is actually the only thing that majorly bugs me about the game, its so dark! everything is dark, its not nice to play for any length of time. Civ V has white fluffy clouds, blue oceans, gold and blue UI, BE is just black and dark blue/green everything, its way too intense for a game that requires so much screen time."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,WhatGravitas,22,Fri Mar 6 13:50:16 2015 UTC,"What makes it worse (or weirder) is that Sid Meier's Starships seems to be a lot more inviting, UI-wise, despite going for exactly the same themes (cool futuristic space-age UI) - but unlike Civ:BE's UI, it makes good use of:   Contrast: bright accents for buttons, making it easier to see them and still keeps the ""hologram feel"" Artwork: the bridge screens and so on seem to use concept art-like paintings to break up monotony every now and then and give you that extra immersion Colour: Starships has a very clear use of colours without being ""bright"", it still feels like space, just less monotone.   Also, XCOM actually did the same very well, an UI with good contrast and colour accents, clear symbols and the use of the ""ant farm"" and the hologlobe to achieve more immersion. Ditto Civ 5 with its art deco-inspired icons - again, colour, contrast and immersion. Firaxis is really competent at UI design, making Civ:BE's mediocre UI really puzzling!"
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,beeblez,14,Fri Mar 6 15:39:39 2015 UTC,"Firaxis is really competent at UI design, making Civ:BE's mediocre UI really puzzling!   This drives me so crazy. I could forgive BE's UI if it was the first game made by some charmingly ambitious indie company or something. But for Firaxis it just makes no sense. They know how to make great UIs and just... decided they would rather not?"
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,WhatGravitas,8,Fri Mar 6 16:23:22 2015 UTC,"I really hope Civ:BE gets an expansion at some point because in this case, the overall UI is function, just the look of it is problematic. They managed to give the Civ5 UI two fairly complete aesthetic redesigns in the expansions (while keeping the good underlying design), so I think that's certainly something an expansion could ""fix"".  I mean that is one of the reasons why I haven't (entirely) given up on BE: I know Firaxis cares about their games and I like the vision behind it. I can still see BE becoming something very solid, much like G+K and BNW turned Civ5 around a great deal.  In other words: can we just get Ed Beach's magic again, with our current dynamic designer duo as the people who envision the world of Civ:BE?"
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,beeblez,3,Fri Mar 6 17:57:34 2015 UTC,"Perfectly said. I have a lot of faith in Firaxis as a company. Even their recent patch where they added coco and buffalo as resources and made a few other minor fixes ages after BNW came out, despite the fact everyone was happy with BNW by this point anyway. There was no outcry but they knew a bit more polish could be applied so they did it.   I would love to see a BE expansion that does for that game what either expansion did for Civ 5."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,MurpleMan,2,Fri Mar 6 18:27:05 2015 UTC,Thank you! Like many of us I switched back to civ5 after a couple of weeks playing BE and I was really baffled as to where those buffaloes came from. I almost convinced myself they were always there and I had just forgotten.
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,crasher_pt,2,Sat Mar 7 01:09:56 2015 UTC,I could forgive BE's UI if it was the first game made by some charmingly ambitious indie company or something.   There's a possibility that they just let a bunch of younger people do it to see what came of it knowing they were not that incompetent. The thing is SW development this detailed is hard and sometimes corners need to be cut.   That or Firaxis lost the original talent.
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,SmellThisMilk,5,Fri Mar 6 16:31:01 2015 UTC,What game did you buy in 78?
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,traxter,17,Fri Mar 6 12:40:54 2015 UTC,"This is so surprising. They were afraid of making it too different from Civ 5? They used the same engine and aside from the tech web, uninspiring start loudouts and how affinities work, its more or less the same with different modifiers and tiles. I think they are absolutely right in saying they were not audacious enough. I definitely didn't want anything even like Civ 5, but I absolutely love the idea of a civ like sci fi computer  board game."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,BFoskett,5,Fri Mar 6 14:04:58 2015 UTC,I think they should have used Alpha Centauri as a starting point rather than Civ V.
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,dontnormally,6,Fri Mar 6 14:08:13 2015 UTC,"SMAC was always Brian Reynolds' baby, rather than Sid. Additionally, the original publisher - EA, iirc - still owns the rights to the series, meaning a ""true"" SMAC 2 is pretty much off the cards."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,runetrantor,12,Fri Mar 6 13:24:19 2015 UTC,"The pair explained that these lessons have been learned and that, as Beyond Earth continues to evolve as a live game, they are working to fix what they perceive as shortcomings.   That is encouraging to hear. I dunno what the hell they were thinking deliberately not changing diplomacy from Civ V though, that is the most complained about aspect of Civ V!"

Now that we have agreed upon it, you can make it up with expansions that make the game more different than civ 5!  Please dont let this die, you are not going to make another scifi game for a long time I'm sure.  Go nuts! That's how AC was made, and look how that went!  Civ 6 will eventually come for those that feel BE is not fun due to not being historical, or too different if you do improve it towards that. So it's not like you are saying to them 'screw you'."
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,nixed9,10,Fri Mar 6 13:48:21 2015 UTC,Sort it out. We're waiting.

But we completely missed it. Here was an opportunity to allow players to do things that you could never do in a traditional Civ; but we just held ourselves back because we were too afraid.""  I applaud them for being so forthright. Not an easy thing to admit."

They need to be willing to go beyond the designs of Civ 5 to bring Beyond Earth to its full potential.  In short, they need more crazy ideas like Galgus!  In all seriousness I probably go a bit crazy with my designs, but Firaxis needs to tap into their crazy side and give big ideas a shot to really make Beyond Earth shine."

During this each leader repeated their same catch phrase over and over as I declared. It is just laziness like this that ruins the game.
civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,gaygirliniraq,2,Fri Mar 6 16:01:55 2015 UTC,"I get that Firaxis wanted to cash in on the fanbase and rope in a few more with a hep, accessible, sci-fi spinoff -- but you can't afford to charge full AAA price for something that has arguably fewer strategic elements than Civ 5 vanilla.  I know there is a wonderful team there at Firaxis, the love that the team feels for the game is evident, but you need to let them off their creative leashes  You're competing against a new generation of hungry developers. Amplitude Studios  released the type of game that Beyond Earth should have been in Endless Legend. Making bold design choices is a big risk, but the industry has to remember that in this time more than ever not being bold is even riskier. Looking forward to playing Beyond Earth's inevitable expansion, I have confidence that it'll be heading in the right direction.  But I think some more content (free of any conditions, like signing up for an obvious upsell to Starships) would dispell some of the bad blood."

civbeyondearth,2y4gn2,crasher_pt,-4,Fri Mar 6 20:50:01 2015 UTC,They held back content from the game.   Pretty standard tactic into selling it later to make more.   I'll keep playing Civ V. You suckered me into spending $50 on Beyond Earth. I'll just wait for DLC and patches and a sale to go back to BE.

civbeyondearth,2y5n6w,Zoythrus,4,Fri Mar 6 18:38:10 2015 UTC,"I particularly agree with the first bullet. My average BE win turn is 50-100 turns earlier than my average Civ 5 win turn, and I'm rarely done with more than half the web by the time I win."
civbeyondearth,2y5n6w,BobbleBobble,2,Fri Mar 6 19:36:21 2015 UTC,"Affinity 16 victory wonders would push victories off by another 30-40 turns.

civbeyondearth,2y5n6w,larknok1,4,Sat Mar 7 06:55:37 2015 UTC,"I played a lot and I think the best way to balance the game would be to reduce the artist bonus to +2 and/or to fix the African union so they don't start with a free earth relic. Thus it would slow down the virtue system that can complitely boost the early game and thus the whole game.   I like the contact win eventhough it is not balance (I once started the game with two progenitor ruins just next to my capital) and it should be a little harder. As for every other win options.   Also, I like the fact that the coming patch is going to put more weight on big cities than on a lot of small cities. Many players online are following this strategy and the late game gets boring because you have to manage way too many cities and turns are getting longer and longer. I feel like it ruins the fluidity of the game. I don't like spending most of my late game taking mostly care of trade routes..."
civbeyondearth,2y5n6w,V_i_d_E,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:52:39 2015 UTC,Artist/AU Combo is especially OP because of that 8th-10th turn Colonist. I'd also add that the Spacecraft beginning bonuses are rather unbalanced with each other. Tectonic Sensor is incredibly useful for long range city planning and most of the other benefits are highly situational based on map type.

The Africans, they alright. When it comes to picking a sponsor i've never though damn i want to play X but them PAU benefits. instead of bringing PAU down, bring France, US and poly up and make them a bit more fun.   Artists. debatable, here i think this is a good choice. energy is good for settler rushing, production is really really nice and so is science. The food one i feel is bad, need love.   Monies. cant be compared with tech or workers really but within its own type it is strong. only baddish choice here is the alien nest one, which is just a one time reveal, yes?)  cargo, imo, Hydroponics(depending on food, your saving 5 turns?) is too weak and Laboratory is too strong (a 20 something turn tech)  one thing I would like to add is how hard cities are too take. three space warriors will die to an outpost, which i think is crazy. again, if you have a ranged unit in a city + hill /walls the amount of units it takes to take that city is just wrong, these are more civ problems than just be that said."
civbeyondearth,2y5n6w,Robolenin,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:40:41 2015 UTC,I feel like Hutama is really hurting with the current state of trade. A simple +3 energy per trade route from the capital might help buff him a little and makes trade imperative for Polystralia in the early game. In essence it would help Polystralia to buy a few units/buildings early game and reenforce trade as Polystralia's dominent strategy.
civbeyondearth,2y5n6w,beeblez,1 point,Sun Mar 8 04:09:19 2015 UTC,"Rebalance every civ to Provide any sort of meaningful bonus across difficulty levels. I would so much rather see every Civ brought up to African Union level. They're really the only Civ where it feels different when you're playing them. ARC;s bonus does add up to slightly higher GPT. Pan-Asia is OK but again not very exciting or impactful; the difference adds up over time but you never really notice it. Bonus trade routes in Capital are OK but pretty early game I'll have 8 routes going anyway and 10 doesn't really provide a different game play experience. etc. Across the board I barely ever notice who my sponsor is. It doesn't impact any decisions or how the game unfolds in any way. I like the concept of a tech web where you don't research everything I really do. But put the fun affinity units earlier, and lower affinity building requirements across the board. Everything fun about affinity comes when you're deep into the end game and aiming to win within the next 30-50 turns depending on victory condition. While I'm trying to devote my empire to a victory condition is also where every fun Unit and Noticeably different affinity building comes in. Tweak it a little, let players enjoy affinity more before game ends.  On the topic of techweb, I feel it should be balanced a bit with the time it tends to take to research early as opposed to deep techs. No dramatic change, but a tweak. I find My earliest techs tend to take 15-20+ turns as my science starts feeble, but then late game when science is rolling the techs drop like flies. Doesn't need an overhaul or anything but maybe a little tweak. Waiting 20+ turns for a first rung tech kinda isn't super fun. It's not a deal breaker but would be nice. Something needs to change a little with health. It's good as a core game concept but I find even if I'm only building 3-4 Cities I still need to prioritize it like crazy and it means I skip a lot of social policies that would be fun."

civbeyondearth,2y5n6w,DionysianTaffer,2,Sun Mar 8 04:46:05 2015 UTC,"Many people feel that the aliens are already boring and disappointingly non-aggressive.  It's a shame, because there's no way to fix that short of installing a mod (which I can't do because my mod screen is broken) and this was an opportunity to really make Beyond Earth stand out from Civilization V. There's an option to add more aliens but they still don't really do anything other than stand there and attack the odd explorer/worker carelessly left next to them.  I believe that they weren't that way in development, though: they were properly aggressive and an actual threat until a few play-testers (with an attitude similar to ynohoo) decided that they hated having to deal with aliens. So yes, downvoted because it's partially responsible for one of the only mechanics that truly made Beyond Earth mechanically different from Civilization V being nerfed out of relevancy. And some people still complain about it because they lose a worker or explorer every four games or so. I'd much, much rather see the pendulum swing the other way and make provoking the aliens actually threatening: instead, attacking aliens horrifies most other sponsors for no visibly apparent reason as the aliens will never be a threat. I usually don't even build ultrasonic fences: even angry/red aliens never attack my cities. The fence is only useful for protecting trade routes.  I'm half expecting Firaxis to ""listen to their players"" and delete the aliens entirely."
civbeyondearth,2y5n6w,LyraHeartstrlngs,3,Sun Mar 8 15:40:41 2015 UTC,"To the contrary, I want more hostile aliens. I'd prefer aliens that will eventually attack you, and if you invade too much territory or damage a few nests, they'll swarm your cities, 4-5 at a time."

civbeyondearth,2xxtt3,Zoythrus,0,Wed Mar 4 21:59:50 2015 UTC,Glad to see I have to pay more for our endgame.
civbeyondearth,2xxtt3,DrowzyD,-5,Thu Mar 12 14:45:13 2015 UTC,Feels like an expansion to Beyond Earth.
civbeyondearth,2xxtt3,Zoythrus,4,Wed Mar 4 21:34:43 2015 UTC,"The gameplay/concept of the game looks quite a bit different from Civ, so it's more of a spin-off."
civbeyondearth,2xxtt3,Drake55645,7,Wed Mar 4 21:54:47 2015 UTC,A spin-off of a spin-off.  I'm still waiting for Sid Meier's Space Railroads and Sid Meier's Space Pirates. :)
civbeyondearth,2xxtt3,TrevorBradley,3,Wed Mar 4 21:59:23 2015 UTC,Or a spinoff of Starships that takes place from the Agricultural Revolution to the Information Age. Sid Meier's Starships: On Track. Eventually the spin-off of the spin-off of the spin-off will get it's own spin-off that has players managing an entire civilization rather than just the transportation sector and it will be called Civilization VI.
civbeyondearth,2xxtt3,Monotrak,1 point,Wed Mar 4 22:39:27 2015 UTC,I'd play it.
civbeyondearth,2xxtt3,Zoythrus,1 point,Wed Mar 4 22:41:02 2015 UTC,"Sid Meier's Space Pirates   I'm not ashamed to say, I would pre-order that the second they announced it if it actually happened."
civbeyondearth,2xxtt3,C-C-X-V-I,5,Thu Mar 5 20:45:32 2015 UTC,It looks like it takes more from the concepts of XCom than BE.

civbeyondearth,2xyeqy,Zoythrus,1 point,Wed Mar 4 22:46:01 2015 UTC,Then get a new harddrive. :P
civbeyondearth,2xyme5,Zoythrus,3,Wed Mar 4 23:29:03 2015 UTC,Gaben wants to talk to you about hats.

civbeyondearth,2xyme5,eddie_pls,2,Thu Mar 5 21:40:07 2015 UTC,I need this.
civbeyondearth,2xuq96,GeneralY7,3,Wed Mar 4 00:57:01 2015 UTC,Isn't there a space game coming...
civbeyondearth,2xuq96,duncanmcconchie,0,Wed Mar 4 10:59:17 2015 UTC,"I, /u/zoythrus, am the friend that was mentioned here, and the reason that /u/generaly7 is now a Redditor!  I think it's a great idea, buddy, and would like Firaxis to notice this. Adding some ""space flair"" would be a welcome addition to BE."
civbeyondearth,2xuq96,Zoythrus,4,Wed Mar 4 04:36:32 2015 UTC,"""Space flair"" is a nice summary of what I'd like to see added to the game. I could go for some asteroid mining, orbital dogfighting, and off-planet colonization. As long as the focus remains on planetary conquest and the affinities."

civbeyondearth,2xttaz,r2devo,6,Tue Mar 3 20:50:22 2015 UTC,I had this issue because of the Direct X verson I was running.. Can you tell us about the computer thats running it?
civbeyondearth,2xttaz,jgill1992,1 point,Tue Mar 3 22:13:23 2015 UTC,I am not home at the moment but I can later.
civbeyondearth,2xttaz,Ugbrog,2,Tue Mar 3 22:24:50 2015 UTC,"Scroll down, dude. He posted back 9 hours ago."
civbeyondearth,2xttaz,Zekkystyle,1 point,Wed Mar 4 12:23:29 2015 UTC,Oh sorry!
civbeyondearth,2xttaz,Kaarox,3,Wed Mar 4 13:03:14 2015 UTC,Turn cyclonic winds off in options.
civbeyondearth,2xttaz,energyinmotion,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:40:10 2015 UTC,What kind of video card are you using? nVidia or AMD?
civbeyondearth,2xttaz,kodemage,1 point,Wed Mar 4 07:46:33 2015 UTC,Your video drivers need to be updated.
civbeyondearth,2xttaz,CmdrViel,0,Tue Mar 3 23:11:00 2015 UTC,this is my specs (the one on the left + 8 gigs of ram)
civbeyondearth,2xttaz,Juicetinian,8,Wed Mar 4 15:24:29 2015 UTC,"So according to Steam, these are the minimum requirements for macs:   Minimum:  OS: 10.9.5 (Mavericks), 10.10 (Yosemite)  Processor: Intel Core i3 (2.2 ghz)  Memory: 4 GB RAM  Graphics: ATI Radeon 4850 / nVidia 640M / Intel HD 4000  Hard Drive: 8 GB available space  Additional Notes: NOTICE: It is possible for Mac and PC to become out of sync during updates or patches. Within this short time period, Mac users will only be able to play other Mac users. NOTICE: The following video chipsets are unsupported for Civilization: Beyond Earth (Mac) • ATI Radeon X1000 series, HD 2400, 2600, 3870, 4670, 6490, 6630 • NVIDIA GeForce 7000 series, 8600, 8800, 9400, 9600, 320, 330, GT 120 • Intel GMA series, HD 3000   If I'm reading this right, and if those specs are right, your Intel graphics chipset doesn't meet the minimum requirement and is unsupported. I'm not sure what you can do about that really (well, short of playing it on another computer). Google to see if others have somehow made it work?"
civbeyondearth,2xttaz,FernwehHermit,2,Wed Mar 4 03:22:29 2015 UTC,"well darn, looks like I need a less crappy computer."
civbeyondearth,2xttaz,PacoTaco321,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:51:39 2015 UTC,"Even minimum graphics are always a bit over-exaggerated on steam, truth is I have the same HD 3000 graphics card and my game runs perfectly fine, along with most other strategy games like Europa Universalis and Total War. If you turn graphics settings as low as you can, you should be perfectly fine, and the game is about the gameplay anyway, not super high-qual graphics."
civbeyondearth,2xs2r6,Zekkystyle,8,Tue Mar 3 12:12:44 2015 UTC,"Any prepatch mod tha messes with promotions break unit orders and promotions (i think). I play with 15+ mods, i had to turn them off 1 by 1 until i could isolate the problematic mod."
civbeyondearth,2xs2r6,attackofthe50ftpanda,1 point,Tue Mar 3 13:07:12 2015 UTC,"So it is the mods? Good I thought my game was broken, thank you I will check it out after work."
civbeyondearth,2xs2r6,TrevorBradley,1 point,Tue Mar 3 13:38:41 2015 UTC,"Just a hint if you have problems that could be one of 15 things.    Turn off half the mods.   If it works, then turn on another half of the half you just turned off and see if it works.  If it didn't work, turn off another half of the half you didn't turn off.    Repeat.  You'll be able to figure out which mod is broken in 4 steps instead of 15 (or on average, 8)"
civbeyondearth,2xs2r6,LostThyme,3,Thu Mar 5 00:39:22 2015 UTC,"To fix that interface disrupting bug with mods, load the mods, hit the X to cancel back to the main menu, then load them again. It will work fine. I used to think you had to load into a game but no, just load cancel, load."
civbeyondearth,2xs2r6,Drake55645,2,Tue Mar 3 17:04:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's convenient.  I had been loading into a game then going back to the main menu."
