Yeah, right mate.   As my dear old mum used to say, ""Get fucked, ya cunt!"""
ukbike,3e6nep,makeinstall,4,Wed Jul 22 11:25:52 2015 UTC,"There is a point here though, it's like the Cars vs Buses argument, one Lorry can carry the same amount of goods as several Vans. Take HGV's off the road and you end up with more LGV's, taking up more road space.  I am not for or against a Lorry Ban, per say (though I do agree they have no place in the peaks), but we do need to look at this in a wider context. This sub is naturally cycle-safety-centric, and can often fail to consider wider implications."

ukbike,3e6nep,MTFUandPedal,3,Wed Jul 22 12:19:05 2015 UTC,"But you are still looking at it on only one metric, consider extra emissions, more traffic and greater cost to the haulage companies.  It would be a much more efficient use of road-space to make HGVs SAFER, as several companies are actively trying to do. Legalise it, and things will improve."
ukbike,3e6nep,ill_tonkso,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:26:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely only looking at one metric - safety.  The details of implementing it for the companies concerned fall into the ""different problem - and not mine"" category.  The stated goal is ""stop killing cyclists with HGVs"".

Simply saying ""I give precisely zero fucks about any of the other considerations bluntly"" might not be that helpful. If your point is that saving lives is more important than keeping shelves full, then I agree with you, but as pollution takes far more lives than collisions, my point is that other factors, such as these, need to be considered."
ukbike,3e6nep,pappyon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:36:28 2015 UTC,"Oh they need to be considered - but they are separate considerations.  ""Pollution"" has much larger sources and many larger causes than just HGVs, or the incremental increase in switching them to LGVSs.  Ironically moves to make roads safer and more bike friendly (lorries scare the living shit out of newbies. They worry me on occasion) is likely to reduce pollution by increasing journeys by bike.  Everything is part of a larger whole that hopefully moves towards making the world a little bit of a better place (and now I sound like a massive hippy- I'm not).  That doesn't mean that actions cant be taken without necessarily resolving every impacting issue."

For example, we ordered two filing cabinets from an office furniture supplier online. They weren't even a large size. They arrived in a HGV - not an artic, but a really large lorry. It nearly didn't fit down the small mews road in front of our office. The delivery had come from South Wales. There was nothing else inside the lorry - just our two small cabinets. He delivered to us late morning, so either he'd been very busy just before, or had driven all that way with just our small delivery which would have fitted in something smaller than a transit.. Even some of the LGVs won't be used to capacity either. My other half used to be an office stationery deliveryman - back in the 90s. They all had high top transit vans and sometimes he would go out in that van just to deliver a box of pencils... If delivery times and vehicle sizes were restricted into central London then the freight industry would have to adapt and become more efficient. At the moment they are dinosaurs and deadly ones (road safety and pollution levels) at that."

Rule # 14 - this is for everyone else's benefit not for you :P Rule # 16 - definitely not optional lol. Wearing a champions jersey without earning it is just poor form. Rule # 17 - optional for the big teams, more of a supporters jersey (plus the actual ex team kit is normally available still sealed and damn cheap for top end kit). Just never wear the whole kit at once :) Rule # 26 - A clean bike is a well maintained bike (normally) but hey it's your ride. Rule # 29 - Yeah audax bags hanging off a brooks aren't saddlebags.... That's cargo space lol That said I use a small Fizik saddle bag to swap a pair of tubes between bikes easily and save a jersey pocket.

The pro cyclist lorry driver is becoming more common, I work with one who has a £4 grand bike and know another site has just done a London-Paris cycle charity ride (I didn't take part, wouldn't get past the first KFC).

When you enter Poynton you're greeted by a plaque telling you it's a ""shared space village"". The traffic light junction has been replaced with 2 (rather pathetic) roundabouts. The roundabouts are probably an improvement as traffic, whilst slow, doesn't seem to come to a complete stand still.

The 23-year-old rider involved insisted he had stopped at the scene and had apologised to the family.   Every time a cyclist hits a pedestrian we have this big to do in the press about how cyclists are dangerous.  You know how many times the same thing happens with cars?  From 2009-2013, 14 pedestrians were killed by bicycles. 1245 people were killed by cars. Why isn't there a story in the press every single time a car hits someone?  People like to whine about ""scofflaw cyclists"". They like to suggest we should be registered and tested. But the reality is, bikes are a few kilograms of wire and tubes at about 15mph. Cars are a tonne of hot metal at 30mph and up.*  It makes perfect sense to be harder on cars for the same reason that you can walk into a shop and just buy a wooden spoon, but you can't do the same with a shotgun.  * please feel free to revise these numbers for speed if a) you are an oaken thighed suffer beast offended that I suggested you only go at 15mph or b) you are used to driving in London, where a car hitting a 30mph average is a ludicrous dream.

Genuine curiosity as I don't know the inner workings of this kind of thing."
ukbike,3dlynn,mitch1975,5,Fri Jul 17 11:26:57 2015 UTC,"If you want to see if a new system is viable the best way is to model it through from the perspective of each party affected by the change, obviously I am going to start with the HGV driver but I will also do so from other peoples point of view, and you can add more. Once we have them all we can put them side by side and see if the new system is better than the current one. . The big HGV, Artic to a big store. These stores have a night shift working and could easily accept more lorries, they have a warehouse area to the rear to store which could hold the next days goods and anyone who lives near one already knows there will be a certain amount of noise. However the depots are far away ( Asda - Bedford, Tesco - Mostly Thurrock, Sainsburys - Have 3 on the M25 and one in Basingstoke, Morrisons - Have one in Feltham but the big stores get fed from Northampton &the A14 corridor) and although routes can be planned there are days when motorways behave differently and things go wrong, when this happens any timed ban becomes unworkable. If it is one of those strange days when the M25 & M1 are running well the journey can be over half an hour quicker and the Artic will have to wait before entering the prohibited area but has nowhere to stop so the only option is to drive up and down the road until the right time, no one wants that, and remember if the road is running well it will not just be one truck it will be every truck on that route, so convoys will be up and down the A4 waiting for the to curfew lift.    If it is one of those common days where the motorway is extra slow then the first truck has no problem but the last one will be late arriving, late unloading, and get stuck in the area for x hours, he may not have the time to get home. . The small HGV,  HGV to small store. No problem;  depots inside the M25, journey times are always slow, drivers know what they are doing. Change a few shift patterns and its all workable. . The small HGV, Delivering food to sandwich shops, coffee shops, which is then ""freshly cooked"" in the store. These guys do multi drop, 6-12 a day and sometimes more. The first few will be before a ban and the truck will have to wait before going back for the second half of his day. Great for the driver, 3 hours pay for doing nothing, but there is nowhere to wait.  Nothing can hold 1000 trucks inside the Nth/Sth Circ, motorway services are a joke, and depots are miles away (Harlow, Aylesbury, Milton Keynes, Banbury, Reading, etc). . The exemptions. Every system will have exemptions, vehicles which have to be there as the work is there is being done. there are many examples (Bin lorry, Market delivery) but the obvious one is construction.  The places they deliver and collect from only work in daylight and so the lorries have to be there in daylight hours, the sites are not big enough to store a days supplies and a days waste and even if they were the unloading couldnt be done in the dark.   Any ban will not affect these vehicles and thus not affect the current situation. . . The stores. Big stores have night shifts, small stores dont.  For them to change delivery times staff would have to start 3 hours earlier and currently have no way of getting to work. People commute and there is no system for 3am travel. Changes are happening but slowly and will never match the rush hour system.  Also staff may object to having their lives turned upside down and being told to start at 3am. . The roads. The MP who talked about this a while back was from Hounslow Isleworth & Brentford, she talked about the city centres. If she was being literal then it makes no sense as Hounslow city centre is pedestrianised,  if she was talking about the surrounding area then you have to decide on what area and what roads. As far as I am concerned once you are past the Heathrow its all urban sprawl and all the same. If you define an area all you will do is force traffic into surrounding areas which will create more problems. You run the risk of sinking into NIMBY territory. .

Anything is possible but needs other changes with it to make it viable; large parking/waiting areas, less delivery restrictions outside the curfew times, transport for receiving staff.

I've been in a few unsavoury situations, but at the very best all I'd be able to provide is a time, location and the colour of the car. My mind goes blank.

The guy walking by helped with that too and he shouted out the number plate which reminded me to take the picture.  101 asked me for the reg, time and location so I checked the timestamp on the picture double checked the street on Google maps. Think that was all the info they needed.  As I explained what happened I made clear that I felt threatened by both his driving and aggressive manner (and his sons), when I said that the operator was sure that she wanted to pass it on to an officer.  I've had a few incidents before, but not with someone getting out of the car like that, so maybe I'm getting more accustomed to staying calm.

Full marks to the Cornbury estate for giving us permission - a really nice change from many of the big landowners who are actively hostile to cyclists.  In the Wychwood area, there's a lot of bridleways that are good for mountain biking or cyclocross-type bikes - bit too muddy for me over the winter but glorious right now.

ukbike,3d8kma,Doctor_Fegg,2,Tue Jul 14 21:24:19 2015 UTC,"Hooeee... where do I start?  The North Cotswolds (around the area I live, from Charlbury across to Chipping Campden/Honeybourne) aren't too hilly and there's plenty of welcoming little towns. The idea behind the Sustrans route (442) is that it parallels the railway so you can hop on and off with your bike.  When you go south into Gloucestershire - Winchcombe, Guiting Power, Chedworth - it gets hillier and more rural; it's pretty much all small villages, some with pubs. The scenery is superb but it's pretty taxing going up one valley side and down the next.   It depends on how much distance you want to cover, of course, but here's a 60-miler along some of my favourite roads: Charlbury-Chipping Campden on NCN 442, south past Snowshill and Guiting Power to Farmington, through Burford to Asthall Leigh on NCN 57, then back to Charlbury.

Any road that doesn't have physically separated cycling infrastructure (other than motorways etc) should be 20mph max.  On the electric bike point my main concern is that 20mph might be a bit fast for people who are new or returning to cycling or older or disabled people.

Haven't considered it deeply enough to be sure.   As for 20mph everywhere, I'm with you but it's meaningless if unenforced, and as someone living in a 20 mph area it's almost universally ignored. It wouldn't narrow the speed gap because cameras slow cars, not road signs. Also, frankly, on roads with speed bumps I'm faster than most cars anyway, and it doesn't stop them 'needing' to be in front, so it's not just about speed.   It's perhaps also politically impossible. But I'd vote for you!"

I know a couple of users (one in their late 50s, and another in their mid30s) and they can easily use the motor to step up in speed  I do think there is a lot of scope for enhancing the bikes though.

Every town has a few roads that should be higher  (The Westway & Limehouse link in London,  Bouges Boulevard in Peterborough,  the A414 through Hertford ) and I am sure you can name one in your town,  but for over 90% of urban roads 20 is fast enough and as you say it reduces the need to overtake. . Electric bikes are a more complicated issue as there are soo many types.  I have seen all sorts from normal bikes with an assist button to ones that resemble a ""knowledge scooter "" (Londoners know what I mean ).

You say untrained people can use boris bikes, but untrained people can also buy an electric bike, unless you advocate for mandatory training for bicycles then it's irrelevant, and at that point you might as well just get a license plate and register them as motor vehicles"

That one saw the camera and was doing everything he could to avoid it seeing his number plate,  glad the other camera was there. . I do believe in training for all cyclists,  others and I had the discussion a few days ago. Most support optional training and I support mandatory training at time of purchase.  A road awareness course would be a waste of a few hours for most but a huge benefit for a few, but it is these few that everyone notices and put on here and youtube. I dont see how taking a course when making a road vehicle purchase leads to number plates and reclassification as a motor vehicle.

Unless they restructure the VED then the income from car taxation would tend towards £0 in the long term. They simply have to do this, to maintain a much needed income stream, and they should be more transparent about this strategy. They should also be vocal on why cycles are exempt - which is 1) they have virtually no impact on road surfaces in terms of wear and tear, 2) they can be considered ring-fenced as non taxable due to no emissions."
ukbike,3cjq3n,AdrianEvans,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:39:54 2015 UTC,"That isn't a sensible explanation. It presupposes that the tax brackets cannot be moved to take into account changing technology. Why not just say ""Cars before 2016 use <current> brackets and newer cars use <updated> bracket""?"

ukbike,3cklwa,stolenbikes88,2,Mon Jul 13 10:46:46 2015 UTC,"So I submitted a freedom of information request middle of last year, requesting details relevant to CheckThatBike!  After missing the 30 day max response time and after some chasing I received a response around a month late refusing my request.   The refusal wasn't entirely unexpected but a disappointment, I have a specialist solicitor that I used on my first FOI request to A&S (which was approved) and indeed it's his letter that I've used to open 50% of UK police force data, so asked him to come on board (at my cost) given the high profile nature of the Met.  We asked for the FOI request to be reviewed internally, as we are entitled to. They reviewed it and again late (we expected a response in Jan actually got one in Feb) acknowledged their failure to communicate a timely response but failed to actually deal with what we asked in the review.  A bit of back and forth and finally we had a concrete refusal siting sections of legislation (around a month after they 'dealt' with our review), we confirmed with the Met we were going to ICO and they didn't change their mind so we did.  Recently and just before the ICO was due to make a decision (having taken a decent amount of time collecting evidence) my solicitor got a voicemail and they backed down supplying all the data I asked for in my original request.  Call me a pessimist but it's almost like they were banking on me giving up or not having the cash to get proper legal advice. I also suspect they backed down to avoid a concrete decision being made by ICO.  It was my decision to take on the cost of legal advice (which is why I can't recover that cost) but it still cost me a significant amount of time fighting them on this."

I use a Burley Travoy which, while quite expensive, mitigates a few of your points; it's quite low profile so filtering isn't majorly impacted, it's easy to fold and unfold, stores in to fairly small state, and fairly easy to mount.

You simply should not have to be concerned about something like that! The lack of cycling infrastructure is shocking, but the attitudes of drivers towards cyclists is at least as big a problem.   I don't have kids myself, but every time I see young children cycling on busy roads with their parents, it just makes me cringe thinking of all the dangers they have to face.

ukbike,3cb0aw,brejc8,6,Mon Jul 6 18:02:28 2015 UTC,"I was involved in a crash a bit over a year ago. Ended up in hospital with a fractured elbow amongst other things. Needed two surgeries and spent a few nights in a ward. The surgery really gave my system a kicking and I found it hard to function for a couple weeks. Slept most of the day for a week. The Tremadol would wear out overnight so I would wake up in a lot of pain. Tried getting back to work but the first weeks were hard to concentrate on anything. After that there was a couple months of rather painful physiotherapy to regain a range of movement in my arm.  All of those physical things were not that big an issue. I knew I would get through them. What really upset me was the driver. I was riding along 20mph limit road with parked cars on both sides. The rider behind me was taking the lane because there was very little space to overtake. As soon as the parked cars ended, he moved to the side of the road. I suspect the driver wanted to punishment pass him and immediately turn left to force him to emergency stop, but instead went through me. We were going reasonably fast (18mph or so). The driver was clearly going far above 20mph.  After the crash, the driver pretty confidently stated that it will be ""no overall fault, it always is"". You could see from the driver's behavior, this was not their first time in a situation like this. The witnesses were very clear that it was the driver's fault. The police never sent an officer to the scene. Instead they sent a PCSO who without asking any questions dismissed all the witnesses without taking their details. You could see the police really didn't want to make this into an incident. The only person I had as a witness was the guy riding behind me, but because he works at the same company as me, it was not considered an independent witness. The police put no charges forward. The idea that there are drivers who repeatedly take shots across cyclists and are perfectly OK with it terrified me. I found myself going through the incident again and again in my head. I would go though previous near misses I had that I didn't care about at the time and relive those compulsively. Every car overtaking and revving their engine would terrify me. I would get home or to work and have a panic attack. I found it incredibly hard to sleep. Eventually I even got a letter from the drivers insurance company offering a 50/50 blame agreement where I would pay only 50% of the cost for the damage my hip did to their car. The driver offered no statement on what happened, and why I should carry any of the blame for being struck from behind. I declined the offer and my solicitors organised a medical evaluation. I wanted to wait some time to see what were was permanent damage rather than demanding compensation immediately. During the evaluation, the doctor asked whether I had problems sleeping. I wasn't expecting this but he probed a bit more and recommended an evaluation by a psychologist. So I did that too, and they recommended a course of EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing). I never heard of it before and I am very sceptical about things like this. I wasn't sure if I should do it because it was quite expensive, but when the settlement came it included six sessions of EMDR, so I thought, well I have nothing to lose.  It really worked. From the first proper session, I lost the compulsive urge to relive the incident. I won't go into the details of what happens, but all I can say is if someone wants to get over an insident like this, it really works. I was so gob-smacked at how I was convinced I was about to die any minute one day and being pretty much back to normal the next. The person I had was Anna Zeffertt but it is a fairly standardised technique used by many therapists. I love cycling and I came close to giving it up. I still get a bit sensitive about my right elbow and wing mirrors passing me by at speed, but I can now get back to normal in no time, rather than it ruining my week.  Good luck."
ukbike,3cb0aw,eVolution91,5,Tue Jul 7 07:49:32 2015 UTC,"It is normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these will improve naturally over a few weeks.  You should visit your GP if you or your child are still having problems about four weeks after the traumatic experience, or if the symptoms are particularly troublesome.  If necessary, your GP can refer you to mental health specialists for further assessment and treatment.   That's from the NHS page for PTSD.  So it looks like that the recommended option is to wait for a few weeks and to see if the symptoms continue and then visit the GP.  My advice would definitely be to encourage your husband to start slowly to regain his confidence, ideally in low-traffic areas. If you live in an estate/cul de sac that'd probably be a good start.   I've had a few scrapes and bad falls but none anywhere near as bad as your husband's. One as a child took me months to get back on a bike just because of how afraid I was. What helped me most was having a friend ride with me to help keep my mind off and to have a great deal of patience."
ukbike,3cb0aw,MTFUandPedal,3,Mon Jul 6 17:35:04 2015 UTC,"Nothing near that bad for me.  I've had more than a few incidents where I've crashed and lost my mojo. One with enough road rash I could see my kneecap...  Ironically that one I was bandaged up and immediately back on the bike - which helped.  Had an off on a wet manhole cover mid-corner a few months back that affected me more than any other accident I've had (strange because in the grand scheme of things it was quite minor) where I spent weeks freezing up on the way into corners out of pure fear kicking in - and freezing up and staying upright nearly caused me several more accidents.  Nothing so major however - so the impact he's having I'd expect would be an order of magnitude bigger. Unfortunately avoiding the bike isn't going to make things any better.  The ""usual"" advice is to take a few days to get your head straight, then get back out there. Take it easy, nothing challenging, but get back on the road and assure your subconscious it isn't going to happen again.  I had a friend go down to a blind idiot who just plain rammed him on a roundabout. Bike a total loss. He's still not been out on a club ride in over a year since, although some of that has been medical issues."

Was off the bike for 3 months, during the next 6 months I was scaredy cat and was throwing the weight on, so joined a gym and went once a week.  10 months after the bump, someone stole a KOM of mine, that kicked me out onto the bike, still havent got it back but am near enough fit again after 15 months."
ukbike,3cb0aw,PickledToaster,2,Mon Jul 6 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"Does he love cycling?  I ask, because some people just see it as a means to an end. If he loves it, give him a bit of time, but talk about all the good things with cycling.  As a lot of the posters here, I've had my share of accidents, but it was my love of cycling that got me back into it (to be honest, it has always been hard to keep me off the bike, but it certainly makes you a far more cautious rider).  Most important, he should understand that not everyone is like the motorist that struck him. The far majority are decent people.  Wish him my best."
ukbike,3cb0aw,Baljet,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:18:34 2015 UTC,"I've had some nasty scrapes, nothing like your husband's altercation, although I've had a few of those that fortunately haven't resulted in any crashes. Recently I came off on my way to work and was off work for over a week with a concussion, that was mechanical failure and claiming a new bike under the warranty kept me off the road until I was fit again. The lure of a shiny new bike definately helped with the motivation get back in the saddle too :)  It's the altercations rather than the crashes that upset me for a while afterwards, the willfull ignorance and dangerous idiocy can leave me a bit freaked out.  So I'd suggest focussing on that side of things, go somewhere without any traffic, maybe a change of pace in cycling and switch to some muddy crosscountry or an afternoon ride along a towpath to the pub and back?"
ukbike,3cb0aw,w0ss4g3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:34:26 2015 UTC,"I was knocked off by an inattentive driver, had a fairly shit reaction from the police, but was able to recover the damages to my bike from the driver's insurance. I had a few minor injuries, big bruise on my leg.. but nothing worse.  I remember being very nervous about getting back on the bike, but I ended up only taking a few days off before forcing myself back on (my other bike) and doing just a few small trips. Within a week or so I was riding to work again.  I'm convinced the key was not letting it get to me and just making myself get back on and get on with it. If I'd hesitated any longer I think I'd have taken a lot more time to get my confidence back.  I still get some odd pangs of fear occasionally, mostly when I'm riding fast (e.g. downhill).. something that I don't remember from before I got knocked off. Maybe it's just getting old, though :)  My advice would be that your husband get back on the bike as soon as possible, even if it's just small distances (even off road - any shared paths nearby?) and work his confidence back up.  The truth is that he didn't really have a crash/accident. He was assaulted by someone and that could've happened anywhere (pub, in the street, etc) - don't let the bike become the object he associates with it!"

I ride to and from work every day in central London, and I'll see maybe on average 10 cyclists run red lights every single day..

ukbike,3bvd6g,deathcastle,12,Thu Jul 2 22:08:35 2015 UTC,"The reason people can get defensive about that issue is that it's incredibly hypocritical to bring up.  I also cycle commute in London, and I most often see motorists breaking the law. Speeding, not indicating, and jumping red lights. The rlj is more often than not at busy junctions, where they become an obstruction to traffic crossing the junction from another part.  Why is it that this behaviour is either excused, or identified as what it is - a small number of idiots being idiots, but when a cyclist breaks a traffic law, they are tarnishing the reputation of all cyclists? The majority of rlj from cyclists that I see tends to be at pedestrian-crossing triggered lights, when the road is clear of people crossing, but the lights are still red. Alternatively, people will set off 2 seconds before the light goes green to get ahead of the motor traffic. I don't agree with breaking the law for convenience's sake, but something like that is a whole lot less dangerous than diving through a set of lights that went red 3 seconds ago and putting your car in the way of a wall of oncoming traffic.  This isn't a case of condoning law breaking because other people do more dangerous things, but when petty traffic violations are used as a rationale for blocking the implementation of life-saving infrastructure, it's not hard to feel angry.  The widening of the M25 wasn't postponed until motorists stopped speeding and stopping in ASL boxes. Potholes are fixed when they become a problem, not when motorists have demonstrated they're all law-abiding and well behaved.  So why is it that cyclists are constantly ordered to 'clean up our act' in order to merit consideration as human beings? Punish those who break the law within the boundaries of it, put measures in place to catch them if you will, but punishing anyone on a bike for the actions of a minority is tantamount to legalised bullying.  Once the new segregated super highways are built, I'm pretty certain that perceptions of cyclist behaviour will change for the better. With a safer place to cycle, plenty of people will no longer feel the need to jump through a red light in order to feel safer. Maybe the same number of people will do it, maybe not, but having highly visible places where high volumes of cyclists are shown just riding along safely and legally will only help."

ukbike,3bvd6g,batty3108,6,Thu Jul 2 23:22:51 2015 UTC,"I'd say the worst thing are motorists who you pass in slow moving traffic, who then roar past you with inches to spare to hurry to the back of the queue at the next set of traffic lights, all the while I am maintaining a constant speed in the bike lane, so pass them again after they stop.   It's demonstrative of the attitude that foments so much of the hostility towards cyclists - the notion that the motorist is being 'held up' in any way.  I often want to ask them if they really believe that my presence is the main thing slowing their journey down, or if the 10 cars waiting in front of them at the lights have anything to do with it.  But the culture is that they always have to be one car further ahead. They have to get past anyone moving fractionally slower than them, and damn the safety of anyone else."

If you are driving a car, you can only jump a light if you are at the head of the queue. Everyone riding a bike has the opportunity to jump a light.  What's more, a typical red light jumping car (""it only just turned red"") is at speed in an attempt to get through in time before traffic starts coming from the other direction. The vast majority of pushbike RLJs I've seen are slow and cautious, giving way to the traffic on the green light. The typical car is far more dangerous. But that's not ""motorists"", everyone knows it's just a bad driver, the exception, not the rule.  There is always the exception and people will remember the worst example they have seen and describe it as ""cyclists do X"" as people who ride bikes (of all forms) suffer from out-group discrimination while drivers don't.

Now I know you're looking for comfort and probably a flat handlebar so things are different. If you're sure you want new over second-hand, I would recommend the Btwin bikes at Decathlon, there's some good Dawes hybrids at Evans Cycles and the Viking bikes you can buy new on Ebay are decent enough too."

It's a great bike and I recommend it as somebody who used it to get fit. It is a good choice.   Problems over that period: broken rear spokes (I'm heavy) - about 6. Both sets of pads wore out. And... that's it. Original tyres. The mechanics disks are perfectly good (I'm on dartmoor, it's hilly). Oh, and I raised the stem for personal fit.  It's good on roads, canals and paths, even done all the red route mountain bike course on Haldon on the thing several times (albiet slower than a suspension bike).

ukbike,3bhylc,Robware,2,Mon Jun 29 11:42:26 2015 UTC,"She'll be riding to work (5-6 miles) and maybe do a few longer jaunts with me at weekends. She tried a more Dutch-style bike but wasn't such a fan of the position. The shifters and gear range are more mtb style, but it is closer to road bike on the hybrid scale."
ukbike,3bhylc,Robware,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:49:42 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. If she's tried it and that's the position that suits her, then great.  As for the bike; it seems pretty reasonable for the price. The general advice for this price range is to go second hand, but Decathlon bikes seem to be an exception to the rule. I know that I'd rather go for a B'Twin than a Halfords bike."
ukbike,3bhylc,HipsterDashie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:56:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, anything else in that price range looked crap - for new bikes, she'd need to spend at least another £100 to get a similarly specced bike."

ukbike,3bhylc,prashanr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:30:08 2015 UTC,"I'd have one myself if I had a shorter commute. The step through frame is ace. I've always liked that style of bike, despite its 'feminine' look (which is totally false; go somewhere like Amsterdam and it's used by everyone).   The frame has internal routing. The hubs and shifter are all shimano, the chain is KMC, and the mud guards are SKS, but the rest is pretty cheap. Not too heavy, though. For the price I rate it pretty well. The chainring isn't massive, either (36/38?), so hills should be ok. The lights could do with upgrading; they don't stay on at all when stopped, nor are they particularly bright."

I wouldn't bother with that deviation towards the river unless you really want to see the Thames. Just keep going through Chiswick, Shepherds Bush (hideous), then head towards Notting Hill and the Euston Rd, or Kensington and the central city for a more scenic route. Or there may be a Thames path route, will be very scenic but very long.   If it was me, I would get in a black cab, and get dropped off somewhere where the roads aren't quite so busy with massive volumes of traffic in and out of the airport. Chiswick maybe? Or use the Heathrow Express, assemble your bike at Paddington, head down the Euston Rd to Kings Cross. Not as adventurous, but after a long flight, the idea of navigating the hideousness of that part of SW London would do my head in. Good luck!"

After reading through dozens of posts about the danger and ridiculous situation abounding with traffic throughout those roads, I'm inclined to agree with you. I'd rather not die or feel like just breaking down and crying before my real journey begins. It doesn't seem too bad to get from somewhere like Paddington, bike to King's cross and check out that wilderness area, the shops and get some food. Sounds MUCH more chill actually to me... And, I honestly don't want to assemble my bike in heathrow... Like at all. That sounds like a f*ing nightmare. But my bike box is HUGE and unweidly as is. And I'm not sure how else to transport it, you know? It's just a giant cardboard box I was planning on chucking as soon as I got off. I guess I could carry it with me though?  Do you know anything about the Heathrow Connect allowing HUGE boxes on-board? I can't really find any info on the site: https://www.heathrowconnect.com/ , but I did my research and it seems like that one is only a little bit slower but much, much more affordable than the express. I'm not really crunched for time. I was planning on just getting my bearings a bit and exploring for a couple of hours at least if I can. You know? Who knows, maybe I'll get a hostel there for the night so I can rest up and attack edinburgh the next day. That sounds like a better idea to me anyways :P"

I can fit 2 people and 2 assembled bikes in the back of one. Don't know about Heathrow Connect, but it's a train service from an airport, so they'll be used to large amounts of luggage.  I didn't think about the bike box situation, but you can get porters at the airport to assist you if it's too much for one person.  Disposal of the box may be an issue at the airport or a train station, as will finding a quiet area where you can assemble it and keep an eye on your stuff."

I wanted to reassemble at the Station (just to be sure I didn't miss my train home), I'll admit that taking my bike box though the underground was a little awkward but if you're travelling outside rush hour with the bike in a box it should be fine.  If you have the time though I'd cycle, the final option is taking the Heathrow Express train to Paddington and cycling the final 3 miles to Kings Cross but this train is vastly expensive for some reason.  The Tube from Heathrow to King's Cross is £6.00 (without a pre-paid card), by far the cheapest if you don't want to cycle."
ukbike,3bh2se,Slartibartfast87,3,Mon Jun 29 08:03:27 2015 UTC,"I would recommend you assemble the bike in the airport. Yes it's a pain but it's probably a lot easier than carrying the bike box around, and it's got wheels! You'll arguably be less tired assembling it straight off the plane, than after lugging a big box across London.  What time do you arrive? This is important because you can take it on the overland trains to Paddington (either Heathrow Express or Connect) during non-peak hours. You cannot take your bike on the underground for your journey.  I wouldn't cycle near Heathrow except on the separated lanes and once you get closer to London you will find it hard to avoid major roads and intersections that are difficult at the best of times. With lots of gear I can see it will be more pain than it's worth. Save the cycling for the considerably better bits of your trip!"
ukbike,3bh2se,Ciderglove,3,Mon Jun 29 10:01:46 2015 UTC,"As many have said, there's a bike path off the road all along the route you posted.  You'll have to navigate some street furniture at the junctions, but that's about it.  Oftentimes you'll think to yourself ""is this still a cycle path?"" -- at these points, just keep going forward: it is a cycle path, despite what looks and common sense are telling you.  Usually it's shared use though, so you have to be nice to the occasional pedestrians.  A frequent trick at bus stops is that the cycle path drops onto the road before climbing back on at the other side of the stop.  There's usually a square painted on the road saying ""bus"" -- you just cycle through that and back onto the sidewalk.  I cycle that route home from work from time to time.  I don't turn off towards the river, instead i continue along the Great West Road until the roundabout that takes you onto Chiswick High Road, which i follow to Hammersmith.  Just before Chiswick High Road you cycle along a path by a flyover.  Careful of the drops at the kerbs there, since they can take you by surprise.  Chiswick High Road is fairly hassle free, though there's at least one traffic light where if you sit in the cycle lane on the left, you'll be in the way of traffic turning left, since they get the light before those going straight.  Either move to the right of the cycle box when going forward, or be prepared to hop out of the way.    At some point near Hammersmith it becomes one-way in the wrong direction.  Traffic has to turn off to the left, but cyclists can continue along a segregated path (behind the white lorry in the picture).  Careful when getting onto this path since traffic will expect you to turn left.  The path eventually forces you to take a right turn (at a dedicated cycle traffic light), which takes you to your planned route past hammersmith tube station (near St. Paul's Green).  The stretch after that to Hyde Park will probably be congested with buses, though i'm not sure there's much you can do about that.  At that point i head South towards Fulham, so i don't have much to say.    Things look ok after Hyde Park -- Wigmore Street is better than Oxford Street, and once you're on Torrington Place you're segregated again.  Getting onto Torrington Place is a bit crazy because the red sign makes it look like you can't enter.  Pay attention to the blue signs down below.  This basically means ""don't go down here, except bikes, you can go down there"".  A better bet for making the turn, since you don't know the roads, might be to stay in the bus lane and then get off and use the pedestrian crossing to get to Torrington Place, instead of finding the correct lane on Tottenham Court Road.  I wouldn't approach Kings Cross via Gray's Inn Road, since you're heading straight into the worst traffic.  I'd turn off down Judd Street until i got to Euston Road (mind the wacky infrastructure before Judd Street -- perhaps doing Marchmont then Leigh St. would be a better option).  Then i'd just get off and push with the pedestrians.  I think there's a way to cycle to Belgrove Street/Argyle Square, but i don't know it."

""Holding the road"" as the American's would say is also a good way to indicate to drivers that it isn't safe to pass.

ukbike,3axw72,batty3108,7,Wed Jun 24 22:19:50 2015 UTC,"I'll address your cycling points first:  1) What would this test entail? Would 7 year olds need to take the test and carry the card with them? How would it be monitored and policed?  I take your point that in areas with high levels of cycling, you will see people of varying ability and experience, and that, on paper, it's not a ridiculous idea to have a minimum standard that should be expected of them.  However, the issue I have with something like this is where to draw the line. Should you have a cycling license to ride along a canal towpath? To hire a boris bike? If it's just for riding on the road, will people without it be allowed to use segregated bike paths, and if so, what do they do if that ends? If there's a minimum age, how would this affect young children?   2) Lights are a legal requirement between sunset and sunrise. People without them during these times are not being sensible.  Making lights tax-free and/or bundling them with every new bike sold would hopefully help reduce the number of people riding without them. Doing this would require minimum standards for brightness, battery life and positioning on the bike - this last point would be difficult to monitor, but I'm sure the mounting systems could be engineered to accommodate.  Your HGV points sound good to me. What's your opinion on this?  The trouble with making some (non-motorway) roads cycle free is that unless the cycle-friendly options are large enough and extensive enough to allow as many cyclists as want to to cycle to wherever they need to go, you'd risk reducing cycling's effectiveness as a method of transport.  The goal shouldn't just be to make cycling safer within the existing conditions, it should be to increase the number of people for whom cycling is a viable choice for personal transport. It will result in healthier people, reduced pollution, and better connections between small communities - all of which are good for the economy."

I know its part of the appeal but I don't like the way a person can buy a bike and ride through the centre of a busy town with no basic road training. It doesn't make sense to me. Lights. Do you agree with the police seizing these bikes at night time and locking them up forcing the rider to walk? .  I saw the prototype for that truck a while back at one of my various training sessions, I like most of it, the glass door so I can see the passenger side, bigger windows, etc., but visibility is always limited by my eyes, they look in the same direction and when I am looking in one mirror I cannot be looking in the other. Yes improve vehicles, improve infrastructure, but IMO the best way to improve the situation is through education of drivers and riders. . What would be on your list?"
ukbike,3axw72,philipwhiuk,3,Wed Jun 24 12:31:17 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is dangerous for someone with no training to hop on a bike and try and negotiate Elephant and Castle roundabout. That said, there are plenty of trained and licensed drivers of all vehicle types (bicycles included) who perform dangerous manoeuvres, so I don't necessarily agree that licensing leads to safety in all cases - nor do I think testing is unnecessary because of a minority of idiots.  Improved cycle-specific infrastructure is top of my list, as this makes other considerations less important, or even redundant. As this is a slow burn in terms of when (and if) it'll actually be implemented, perhaps some kind of basic training could be offered/required when buying a new bike?  I'm not entirely comfortable with that though. As someone that the press would likely describe as ""an experienced cyclist"", if I were to be made to prove my capability before buying a new bike, I'd feel both patronised and pissed off. The age question is again important here.  I guess including road safety as a topic to cover within the Education system would work alright - we did cycling proficiency at school, which is where I learned basic manoeuvres and signalling. But making it mandatory would be tricky without the funding in place to ensure every child could take it, and it doesn't cover those who aren't present for it (immigrants, for example).  One thing that the police have done before is to fine lightless riders, with the fine being waived or reduced if they can prove they have bought some lights within a certain time period. Encouraging people to get lights, rather than simply punishing those without them, is the mindset we need to adopt. I've heard of people (possibly police, but I don't recall exactly) keeping a stack of cheap, functional lights handy to give to people without them. This lets them continue their journey (and avoids police effectively confiscating a vehicle for a petty offence) and makes them safer.  Other than infrastructure, things on my list, in no particular order, are:   Education for all road users on everyone's rights and responsibilities, as well as the laws and regulations.  Strict liability for road users.  Stricter enforcement of traffic laws and meaningful consequences for people who cause death and injury on the roads.   I feel that if these things were to change, there would be eventual shifts in attitude that would make the roads safer for everybody."

ukbike,3axw72,LondonChap86,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:36:03 2015 UTC,"Yup, the driver who killed 2 people and seriously injured another (6 months or more later while on police bail) was eventually imprisoned for death by dangerous driving.  The driver who is owner of the company was fined as a driver, but no action (apart from the investigation) against the company itself has been taken as yet.  I'm not an expert, but have friends working for Westfield who are based less than a mile from me, and I get the impression there is no way that sort of thing would happen there.  I'm not anti haulier, westfield have always been really good when I've encountered them on the road (so much so that I don't mind pulling over on my bike to let one past, when I might not for others) and off the road, they were very interested when I raised the issue of local council refusing to use trixi mirrors, and again when one of their drivers saw a polish lorry hit our car and drive off."

ukbike,3axw72,heavymetalengineer,2,Thu Jun 25 10:13:19 2015 UTC,A lot of media is. The facts get in the way of a good story - unfortunately it means we all pick up a bias of some kind.
ukbike,3axw72,heavymetalengineer,3,Thu Jun 25 10:16:07 2015 UTC,"The issues behind any mandatory test have been party addressed, the other is the addition if barriers to cycling is never a good thing.  My vote   Segregated facilities that are actually decent and useable (see the Netherlands for nirvana)  Presumed liability  Banning of hgvs during the day from city centres (works out nicely for Paris)  Massive increase in fines for cycling without lights.  Actual support for a cycling network. Build or resurface a road? Add a metre to it and out a cycle lane in - where building from scratch build a parallel separate lane.  Actually fining people for encroaching on advance stop zones.  An actual (rather than just words) commitment to a cycling network and support for it."
ukbike,3axw72,LondonChap86,0,Wed Jun 24 20:22:28 2015 UTC,"If the idea of a test puts people off then how about a road awareness course, though I think the initials RAC are already taken.  Others on here have promoted free courses and asked for them to be widely publicised, could they be included with a bike purchase?    Segregated facilities are the end goal for all, but they are a long way off. IMO we need another way of improving the roads now.    I support a decent cycling network. I used to live in Peterborough which has a better one than most cities and I think its a great system. It also has a ring road of dual carriageway which legally cycles can use but never do as the paths provided are better. You are right about building from scratch as opposed to just adding blue paint. Too many times I drive on a urban road and lane 1 has had a third of it cut out for a cycle lane which means cars are squeezing past where there isn't room, buses and trucks have to switch to lane 2 or go into the other carriageway. Rip a road up and start from scratch, from shop window to shop window needs redesigning. A am totally against a blanket ban on HGVs, it may work for Paris or Milan but I don't see it working for London. My knowledge of how the industry works means I see different problems than others and London doesn't have the infrastructure for a ban. I can see a selective ban happening and would support that. Lets pick an example like the A11 from Bow to the City, that is a busy road for cycles and has an alternative for motor vehicles running parallel (the A13). Make it 7.5t from 7am to 10am and free up the road. same with Kensington High street (which has the A4). Presumed liability is the reflection of victim blaming, both are wrong. I know a retired accident investigator and he said the only presumption he ever went into a scenario with was everyone is lying, even the independent witnesses. Massive increase in fines for defective motor vehicles as well, too many have lights out and if you ever talk to a tyre fitter ask him how often cars come in with illegal tyres and then drive out again. Adopt a French system of drivers carrying spare bulbs (though modern cars are a pain to change, esp Renaults). You and I will differ on advance stop zones, I would get rid of them. They place cycles in the flow of traffic, I prefer segregated lanes on my left."
ukbike,3axw72,ill_tonkso,5,Thu Jun 25 09:28:48 2015 UTC,"The thing about tests and licencing being a bad idea is purely that instituting barriers to cycling has it's own social costs. The cost can be quantified in £ simply by looking at the cost to the NHS from someone who uses a car or public transport vs someone who takes regular exercise.  We can also add the negative impact from the public transport / traffic although that's hard to quantify.  Mandatory licencing and registrations etc has the same effect as mandatory helmet laws - even with the best intentions - of reducing take up of cycling and the costs of that can be quantified too. These have been implemented in various places around the world and we can watch the result.  Bottom line, it's a bad thing. Ironically I'm all behind training, despite counting as an experienced cyclist these days, with national and international cycling qualifications - I still show up at the skills sessions our club coach runs monthly (admittedly these have a different focus).  I wish there were a way of implementing a mandatory training scheme without putting cyclists off, but I cant see a solution.   The left isn't a safe place to be IMHO in urban slow moving traffic.  Personally I'd far prefer to be in the midst of traffic or overtaking on the outside around town (think of the road positioning of a motorbike). The only time I'm heading back to the left is on fast roads (or hills) where there's no way I'm moving at traffic speeds.  Presumed liability however appears to work well where it's been implemented, this is a reflection of something implemented in many places across Europe and we have feedback and can watch it in action. So other people have been the guinea pigs.  Ref the ban during daylight hours - have to say I know almost nothing of the industry. As a result, I can point to places that have done similar, but haven't any depth of knowledge about how that worked or would work here. Without that knowledge it sounds like a simple solution."

No one wants the inconvenience of having to slow down and give way to cyclists. ""Make cycling safer, put the cyclists somewhere else!""  That's not to say I don't want segregated cycle lanes. But in other places segregated cycle lanes means a quality infrastructure much like the road network but only for bicycles. What it means in the uk is a strip painted down the middle of the footpath that gives way every 10 meters and allows drivers to blame the cyclists when they're using the road and something goes wrong.

ukbike,3auia9,batty3108,7,Wed Jun 24 10:58:31 2015 UTC,Tippers kill pedestrians on a fairly regular basis and they have their own segregated infrastructure. I see little downside to adopting a lorry design better suited to congested environments.

Even if everywhere in the country was given top-quality Dutch-style lanes, and we never had to come within 10 metres of an HGV on our bikes, it would still be a good idea to develop lorries like this.

Cycle specific, segregated infrastructure means no need for ASL boxes, no need to develop new lorries or detection technology, no need to 'educate' cyclists that, despite the bike lane leading there, it's not safe to ride up the inside of a large tipper truck.  All of these things become redundant if cyclists are separated from the traffic by physical barriers, in a safe, purpose built space designed to accommodate them."

ukbike,3ap3re,DoorsofPerceptron,2,Mon Jun 22 20:30:15 2015 UTC,"It's rather counter intuitive. I thought that more reckless riders would be more likely to become road pizza. But I guess it makes sense that if you ride often (ie, not a casual) you are not as likely to make bad road decisions, are more likely to be confident and fast, and will be less likely to get into a dangerous position.  It seems even if some run red lights, they still have enough road sense to avoid collisions.  Maybe the moral of the story is that the casual cyclists who are timid with bad road sense are the biggest victims. I wonder how many of them used Boris Bikes."

I wouldn't be against a licensing system for proficiency and knowledge, though I think it might be better to perhaps also have a mandatory education about cycling safety in school. I remember that cycling proficiency was optional and when I was about 8/10 years old (not an age one should be cycling on the road). I'd say minimum age to do it should be 14 and it should be mandatory.  If we can hammer it into the head of the populous enough do not ever undertake large vehicles then hopefully it will become common knowledge in the dawn of this cycling revolution we are seeing."
ukbike,3ap3re,SomethingIntangible,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:21:34 2015 UTC,"The education of correct road use for all vehicles could be taught at school but that's a generation away from having an affect. One of the things I would explain is when driving a HGV I leave a space for a reason, the rear wheels don't follow the same line as the front, and just because there is some empty tarmac doesn't mean you should go into it. My mirrors and sensors help spot people who do but I only have one set of eyes and the best way is to teach people not to travel alongside my truck unless you are 100% sure you can get clear in front before I move.    I feel the cycling revolution is happening too quickly, Londons infrastructure is not ready for it and some cyclists are not well informed enough to cope with traffic.

ukbike,3ap3re,mitch1975,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:06:40 2015 UTC,"It certainly is a rapid change. I think it has to do with economic stresses and ecological urgency. I doubt it has anything to do with enjoyment, since cycling on the roads has only become worse and is more likely to put people off. One can only hope it also has to do with a mass awareness of social responsibility for less noise, cleaner air, and healthier people, but that is a little idealistic. Do you cycle? The reason I cycle is that cars are expensive, and most of my trips are <10 miles.  I do think London (and the rest of england) has a long way to go before cycling can be commonplace. It'll take a while for the initial shock to wear off, and for most people to adapt their transport paradigm. It would be good to get over this post-thatcherite ""greed-is-good"" mentality that has weaved its way into our social fabric. Memes such as ""bicycles are only childrens' toys"" and ""if you don't have a car you are a failure/immature"" can't be quashed quickly enough."
ukbike,3ap3re,SomethingIntangible,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:30:03 2015 UTC,"I am outside the M25 and I cycle for leisure, I do pop to the village shop occasionally but more often I walk. To visit a town for a purpose I would use a car. I used to cycle in London years ago.    The memes you mention are along a similar vein to the Top Gear episode  (Red & Green, learn the bloody difference) and I think they are meant to entertain some by annoying others. I disregard them, just as I do those who shout Terrorist and Murderer on here when describing dangerous driving."

ukbike,3ap3re,itsbroady,8,Mon Jun 22 12:39:41 2015 UTC,This one looks like poor cycle lane layout encouraging people to go up the inside of traffic to get the ASL in front of it. If you do that and the lights happen to turn green you're suddenly in an awful unsafe place to be instead of the ASL.
ukbike,3ap3re,mmitchell30,12,Mon Jun 22 14:06:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately this design is every ASL I've ever seen, too."
ukbike,3ap3re,el_matt,2,Mon Jun 22 16:02:40 2015 UTC,Yup. The amount of unseasoned cyclists I see get almost wiped out by going up the nearside if left turners is scary. It's nearly always safer to take the middle of the road like a motorbike.

ukbike,3ap3re,Slartibartfast87,5,Tue Jun 23 11:18:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly. There needs to be a concerted campaign to try and get it across to all cyclists that if reaching an ASL means squeezing up the inside of a line of traffic which could start moving at any moment, you shouldn't do it! There's this really widespread perception that ASLs are somehow ""safe"" and so you should make every effort to get into them, when it's usually much much safer and easier to simply pick a spot in the queue of traffic between a pair of vehicles (rather than beside one!) and wait there in a good strong position where you can be seen by the drivers ahead and behind.   I'd be in favour of simply getting rid of most ASLs because they exert such a strong attraction on unwary cyclists (and of course so many motorists ignore them anyway)."

ukbike,3acbub,Ajrt,7,Thu Jun 18 23:11:20 2015 UTC,"The Loire Valley is fabulous for cycling. There is a wide, good quality segregated cycle path which runs along the banks of the Loire - Loire a velo - think it runs for 800km! http://www.cycling-loire.com/cycling-loire-map We did the section between Amboise and Tours and back in a day when camping at a lovely campsite on the banks of the Cher at Chenonceaux. The path is wide, flat very easy to follow and runs along the river, through villages and vineyards - simply stunning! There are lots of other cycle routes in the area both on and off road. We did drive to the campsite we stayed in, but there is a local TER train which runs from Tours along the Cher valley and stopped just across from the campsite. The trains aren't very frequent, but all timetables are online and you can take bikes on the TER trains. I believe Tours is on a TGV route. Tours itself is a very handsome city for a visit plus bike friendly. Centre is pedestrianized, but cycling allowed and where ever there isn't a segregated track there are shared use pavements, which are fine for when you are on a relaxed holiday ride. We were there in 2013 at the same time as the Tour. We saw it finish in Tours one day (hence the long day ride) and then cycled out to intercept it in the countryside on the second day - very fun indeed. Not sure where the route is this year at the time you plan to be in France, but worth finding out.  Cycling in France is just great.. Drivers are respectful and leave you plenty of room when passing even on busy roads. Every area we have visited has plenty of marked cycle routes both on/off road - go to the tourist information office to pick up leaflets and maps. Then of course - there are plenty of nice lunch places where nobody bats an eyelid when we turn up in cycling gear and ask to keep our bikes close to us on the terrace.

ukbike,3a9ura,pikeamus,2,Thu Jun 18 11:15:23 2015 UTC,"If the sensors work well then I think it's a nice idea. I wouldn't hold my breath for reliability though. There was recently an ""upgrade"" to a pedestrian crossing near me, where they claimed to put in sensors that would allow more time for crossing if a pedestrian was still on the road. It does not work at all. I've witnessed loads of older or disabled people hurry on because the beeping stopped when they were only halfway there - exactly as it was before."
ukbike,3a9ura,andycycles,2,Thu Jun 18 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"A multi million pound roadwork project   Of course, these guys don't care about wasting lots and lots of money.   which has caused months of delays for motorists   Oh really? No delays to cycle/bus users or pedestrians then? As we know, only 'motorists' really matter (and nobody would ever use more than one mode of transport in their life, we are all tribes of ""x-ists"")   A signal displaying a green bike comes on before the full green for other traffic, allowing cyclists a five second head start on other vehicles.   A superficial cycle facility that also retains the maximum throughput capacity/nearby parking space for motoring? Oh, how convenient.  Do most ordinary people want to cycle or find cycling appealing at all in the same physical space with high flows of cars? NO. We know what the barriers to cycling are. A ""head start"" traffic light? Only a few seconds of protection and then you are back on a busy road yet again like usual!   ThermiCam detectors use video and thermal sensors to detect cyclists and distinguish them from other vehicles, meaning the advance lights are not used when there are no cyclists, avoiding delays to other road users.   A nice bit of work for whoever manufactures/programs/installs these sensors then. Other than that, what a waste of technology, and again, avoiding delays to cars is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING EVERRRR.   Councillor Malcolm Kennedy, cabinet member for regeneration and transport, said: “We are using the most up-to-date technology to help cyclists.   We have a long, long way to go."

I figure, if there are two roads and everyone only takes one of them, there's probably a reason.  However, it's worth bearing in mind that these are fast commuters, so sometimes they'll take a direct main road over a circuitous quiet one."

ukbike,3a86gq,Elanthius,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:25:10 2015 UTC,I did this (and then on to Holyhead) by going along the A4. I guess you won't be going that far south but if you do Marlborough is a great town to stop in. One thing I'll say is that sometimes roads look pretty safe but anything over 40mph speed limit for cars is pretty unsettling so you need to be comfortable riding under those conditions. A lot of those long back roads have speed limits at 60 as well which can be worse if they are straight enough for people to get up that fast.  If you are getting a hotel for the overnight stop don't bother pre-booking one as there are going to be tons of rooms to rent in pubs in every town along the whole route.  Make sure you drink plenty of water and eat regularly if you are doing ~80 miles a day.

Over the Severn Bridge then follow the coastal marshes to Cardiff. Hardly any major roads at all.  Either side of Oxford it suggests the A40 bike path which is efficient though not exactly scenic - you could perhaps vary that a little, e.g. by following NCN 57 through Horspath, but don't be tempted by the Farmoor/Swinford road (B4044) because it's lethal."

There is a good chance you hired a small bike with a childs saddle, i know i used to work there and hire them out.  The small bikes come with them fitted by default.  You need a female specific saddle. A general adult one will be a lot better, but a female one will be better due to the different hip widths."
ukbike,3a1kgr,hairnetnic,8,Sun Jun 21 07:53:35 2015 UTC,"A firm saddle with little padding is much preferable to those silly deep squish things.  A decent saddle, some cycle shorts and some arse-cream will go a long way to making life more comfy.    After that make sure the bike isn't too long so your weight is mostly on your arse but with some on your hands as well and after that it's only your legs and lungs that will limit you.  And both of those will improve rapidly!"

I tried a few Brooks saddles before (the B17) which I didn't get on with. And I'd used other saddles in the past I loved (the Charge Spoon was a favourite on my hybrid, Mountain bike and road bike before I switched to different bikes).  Not saying you should spend a fortune on saddles, but be aware that you don't have to stick with the one the bike came with and that it's worth trying some others if you find one doesn't work for you."

You need a half decent bike (cue a ""what bike"" thread)  You then need to get that bike fitted, think of it as having a bike set up to be like a tailored suit, so it fits perfectly.  Everyone's body is different and a bike I can ride for 12 hours straight would leave other people in agony, this is why there is a massive variety of saddles out there.  What you don't want is one of those big squishy saddles. They aren't that comfy. Padding goes on your ass :)  A decent saddle, a well set up bike, a decent pair of bibshorts and you're good to go and can be set up so that it's not uncomfortable.

As for the bike, then definetly head down to the LBS and get some measurements done for a bike, a proper bike setup can make all the difference to pain while riding.  Dont be put off by previous problems, they should all be able to be sorted out, most of all just enjoy the riding, change little things on the bike and see if it helps each time, seat height, stem length etc."

There are 8 bikes allowed on the Ipswich-Norwich route which is the one Diss is on. Slightly nearer than Ipswich and almost certainly going to be quieter.

I've now escaped from there but there's plenty of good bike shops around that will do you a good deal second hand.   Harry Hall cycles on Whitworth St were pretty good. There's also a shop on Lane End Rd in Burnage (forgotten the name now) that always had bona fide secondhand bikes and trade ins for sale.  Worth checking out the police auctions too. GMP have literally thousands of seized and unclaimed bikes that they get rid of once in a while.  As others have said, avoid the Argos bike like the plague. For all-round commuter/leisure ride with pannier racks and all the gubbins you could do a lot worse than a Dawes Discovery 201 EQ. On sale at Evans currently for about £330. Good quality build and if looked after will outlive you.   Edit: pop down to Decathlon at Stockport and see some of their bikes in the flesh. Their bikes score consistently well in reviews at the value end of the scale."
ukbike,3a0yrf,cavendishasriel,2,Tue Jun 16 20:22:46 2015 UTC,There's a little bike shop near the Sugden Centre just off Oxford Road behind the Sandbar. They specialise in doing up second hand bikes to sell or lease out

ukbike,3a0yrf,FluffyBunnyOK,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:10:34 2015 UTC,I doubt you will get a good enough new bike for £200.  Good commuter bike needs to be:- * Light enough. * Have tyres that are thin enough for the terrain. * Good quality lock. * Smooth gear change. * Lights * Have mudguards * Have a rack * Waterproof panniers.  A more reasonable price range for this  is around £500.  Many people have unused bikes - asking friends or colleagues may find a cheaper or free bike.
ukbike,3a0yrf,FluffyBunnyOK,2,Tue Jun 16 12:20:21 2015 UTC,"So long as its reasonable, a second hand bike will do fine. Nobody I know has a unused bicycle.  New bicycles seem quite overpriced, you end up paying almost as much as a car for one when you're trying to save up on it all.   I'm quite a beginner when it comes to it, so no guarantee I'll stick to it but something entry-level would do fine, so long as it lasts at least a year."

So there's a certain sense in buying something dirt cheap, riding it into the ground, and seeing how you cope with it. Yes, that bike is total junk, cheap components and insanely heavy - and if you ride anything better at any point, you won't want to go back - but it might be good for finding out how you feel about commuting. It's like when you want to buy a guitar and everyone says 'well, you must spend at least £600' and you don't even know if you like it yet!  15mph+ is perhaps a bit optimistic, depending on your route/hills and roads. Easy on a good road bike with a nice surface, not so good on a pitted back road with a hybrid.  If it gets any serious problems, it's probably not worth fixing. Second hand is a good idea, if you can find a decent offer. If you really want new, Decathlon might be a good bet for <£200 ? - from memory their low end bikes are often fairly reasonable for the cost Avoid suspension forks, it'll be trash for the price."

ukbike,3a0ms9,Nopdjp,3,Tue Jun 16 08:18:17 2015 UTC,"When I was buying a new bike (upgrading from the MTB I'd had since I was 14), I tried out a hybrid and a road bike. I eventually went for a road bike, and I'm really glad I did.  I've never raced or competed in anything - I've done one organised charity ride, and I'm doing the London-Surrey 100 this August, which will be my first Sportive in the three years I've had the bike.  I started just cycling to and from work, for which a hybrid would probably have been fine. But for riding for fitness and leisure, I'd definitely recommend a road bike - the training I've been doing for the 100 miles would be harder on a hybrid.  With £1000 you can get a very good road bike, that you probably won't want or need to upgrade significantly for a very long time (clipless pedals and maybe the saddle would probably be the only things you'd want to change early doors). If you think you might"
ukbike,3a0ms9,batty3108,3,Tue Jun 16 08:47:26 2015 UTC,"My first bike was a hybrid, and I wish it hadn't been - on the whole, I think road bikes give you everything you'd be using from a hybrid without the downsides. I've now had two proper road bikes and love them so much more!   As far as I can see, the only possible advantage of a hybrid is that it's a bit more rugged, but I'm not even convinced of this point - my road bike is pretty robust. Over long distances, a hybrid will be less comfortable than a well set-up road bike, because you've only got one handlebar position, and it will be slower. Go for the road bike - there's nothing a hybrid can do that it can't, but it can do much more!"
ukbike,3a0ms9,refomokm,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:30:43 2015 UTC,If you want something a little more rugged a cyclocross bike or touring bike is the way to go over a road bike.
ukbike,3a0ms9,heavymetalengineer,3,Mon Jun 22 12:06:26 2015 UTC,"If you're unsure, you might also want to consider looking at a cyclocross bike as a medium between hybrid and road bike. Also more likely to have fittings for panniers/mudguards if you're interested in a commuting option. Can also use it to ride on a number of different surfaces so road/off-road routes are feasible for training rides."
ukbike,3a0ms9,magicjavelin,2,Tue Jun 16 11:09:59 2015 UTC,"i would get a cyclocross bike. CX bike can do anything a hybrid can, so you have the versatility.

ukbike,3a0ms9,jlb8,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:59:00 2015 UTC,"You probably will buy a road bike eventually. My first bike as an adult was a hybrid and I traded it in for a road only 1.5 years later. I'm no professional; I wear baggy shorts, Lidl gloves and three year old runners instead of going clipless. However, I easily gained 5-10km/h over the hybrid and having three or four positions for my hands makes things more comfortable. It made my cycling experience much more enjoyable. My bike only cost about €600, so I'd like to imagine what a £1000 road would feel like."
ukbike,3a0ms9,yawnz0r,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:23:01 2015 UTC,Well thanks for the advise guys. I will bite the bullet and I will buy a road bike with carbon frame and descent group set. Is disc brakes better than rim brakes. If so what price range will I be looking at?
ukbike,3a0ms9,BouncingLlama,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:16:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, discs are almost universally better than rim brakes. They have better stopping power, modulate better, are much less affected by rain and other road crap and they don't wear down your rims. I personally find the ones on my bike easier to maintain and adjust than rim brakes as well."
ukbike,3a0ms9,heavymetalengineer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:45:57 2015 UTC,Have a look at Planet X. their bikes are fantastic value for what you get and if your price range is £1000 they have many great bikes that fall under that. For example:  XLS Cyclocross (Carbon + disc brakes) £999.99  Kaffenback (Steel + disc brakes) £749.99  Pro carbon (Carbon + rim brakes) £899.99  London Road (Carbon + disc brakes) £799.99  The only downside is that they pass on the admin fee from the C2W scheme to you and depending on scheme that can be 10% which wou have to pay upfront with your order. Even with that 10% I would have struggled to get anything close to planet X's spec from another bike shop on any of the 3 bikes I have bought from them. As you can tell I am a massive planet X fan.

ukbike,39w8s8,ithika,6,Mon Jun 15 10:58:14 2015 UTC,"My commute's only about 6 miles each way, so it's a lot easier to get by. What I would recommend regardless are good mudguards, a breathable, warm jacket, if you can find one, thick gloves and I also like buff type things for when it's really cold.  Everything else you can just change when you get to or from work, so it doesn't matter too much what you wear. Personally, I ride with a softshell jacket, base layer and jeans through most of winter. With your distance I'd swap the jeans for cycling bibtights.  I always ride on Continental Gatorskins for their puncture protection."
ukbike,39w8s8,adam-_-,3,Mon Jun 15 08:56:08 2015 UTC,"Good points above.  To echo:  1) Mudguards mudguards mudguards.   Mine keep the spray off my feet which is a revelation to me after all those years of cold wet feet! 2) 18 miles is circa an hour commuting which is plenty of time to get cold.   Avoid anything that traps water/sweat (like jeans) and by some clothing that breathes.   My go to brand is wiggle's DHB which is, I feel, a good compromise of price v quality. 3) I saw mention of specialised tyres but on a road bike they don't offer much improvement imho noting how limited the contact patch is.  I had an off on ice commuting (large manhole cover!) that I switched to a CX which is much more robust."

ukbike,39w8s8,Robware,2,Mon Jun 15 12:10:01 2015 UTC,"Last winter I did come a cropper on ice a couple of times. Ice cover was pretty regular, but most of the time I could handle it, albeit slowly. If I had these it would have made life a lot easier. I was using a marathon mondial rear and a CX tyre front, both at a fairly low pressure (50<60 and 30<40, respectively), which helped a lot.  OP mentions back roads; these are very prone to ice in my experience. If I was doing more distance I would probably have gone down the ice spike tyre route."

When it's really cold I layer up a merino jersey on top. Thick, thick gloves, I upgraded this winter to some gore lobster gloves I wear jeans usually but if I'm going for a longer ride I have a pair of Bontrager Race Thermal Bib tights, which are nice and toasty Merino socks Overshoes if it's raining or looks really cold. I have a Seal Skin pair which are falling apart. You can probably find better.   I haven't had any major problems with ice but I commute in London where it's probably not as bad, so the gatorskins have been fine for me."
ukbike,39w8s8,Kazium,2,Tue Jun 16 08:37:46 2015 UTC,"I will never go back to using Gators.

I cycle through the winter, only avoiding the harshest days. But after a mile or so im up to temperature.   I wear - jeans with long johns underneath, cycle jersey and cycle jacket, skull cap and gloves. Ill probably have overshoes on too.  Thats it."
ukbike,39w8s8,pikeamus,6,Mon Jun 15 10:19:39 2015 UTC,"I started my 12 mile each way commute in Feb, it was brutal at times, but I stuck it out rain, hail or shine. You get used to it.   Some points  -The first 10 minutes is chilly as shit, you will suffer at first but as the blood gets pumping you will warm up and not notice the cold anymore  -Gloves, it's all about the gloves, if your fingers are frozen you can't brake! I had some thin silk gloves underneath my 'mountain bike' padded gloves, kept my fingers nice and toasty.  -Don't layer up, you don't need it. Layering up will make you too hot because you are exercising! The wind is what makes you cold, wear one layer plus a windbreaker, it'll be cold at first but then will be comfortable for the rest of the way.  -If it's going to be wet, get waterproof overshoes, wet feet are the worst and can cause you problems.  -I tried a balaclava, it's nice at first but it was too much after the first few miles and i ended up taking it off  Don't underestimate how much heat your body generates on it's own, especially while exercising."
ukbike,39w8s8,MTFUandPedal,3,Mon Jun 15 15:49:36 2015 UTC,"As a motorcyclist I guess you're well aware of how crap it is to ride when wet/cold. So if you're going to be doing it daily I would absolutely recommend investing in a decent breathable jacket. Especially as you're going 18 miles! Lots of layers too, obviously. A buff/snood around the neck and one more as a headband to cover the ears goes a long way. I also carry some waterproof overshoes in my bag in case the rain-Gods come out. Oh, and decent gloves - nothing worse than cold hands.   My commute is only 5 miles each way, but I tend to wear a base layer, a thick/warm jersey and my waterproof/windproof jacket. That is just about enough, but if the weather drops towards 0 then I'll also add a second base layer. If the weather gets frosty then I don't ride in as, personally, I don't fancy taking the risk.  With regards to the actual riding, I use the same tyres all year around (Continental). However I ride far more 'conservatively' to avoid slipping - particularly when going over drain covers which are incredibly slippery when wet.  Again, I'm sure you know this already, but for me visibility is absolutely key. I have two front lights, two rear lights, hi-vis jacket and a hi-vis bag cover (which is also waterproof). This winter I'll probably upgrade the lights too as there were a few occasions last winter where I still wasn't spotted (but that was probably down to driver negligence)."
ukbike,39w8s8,Fa5tEddy,3,Mon Jun 15 09:16:10 2015 UTC,"The built in temperature control that you get on a bike is really useful. Too cold? Go faster. Too warm? Slow down.   In the winter, I wear a long sleeve cycle top, a short sleeve jersey over that, and a breathable hi-vis jacket. Take off the jacket and I'm in my Spring/Autumn gear, and if I lose the long sleeved first layer I'm in my summer clothes. I don't do anything special for my legs, I just use the same cycle trousers all year (switching to shorts if it's over about 12 degrees in the morning).  The extremities are about the only thing that need attention. A good pair of winter cycling gloves (mine are from Aldi and are perfectly sufficient for ~8 miles, you might need more for 18) are essential. Something for your ears is very much appreciated. I wear ear pops (bandless ear muffs). A thick pair of thermal socks and you're all set.  Edit: I don't change my bike setup, I've found 32s are fine tire wise, but I do avoid certain areas that I know are inclined to be icy. There is a particular underpass on my route which can collect water which freezes at the bottom. It's not enough to cause a problem for cars, but the first year I went through it did cause me to come off. I now come off the main road and rejoin after that section. It only costs me twenty seconds typically, so I've just made it part of my usual route so I don't have to think about it when the weather gets worse."
ukbike,39w8s8,cookieofchaos,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:28:13 2015 UTC,The aldi winter gloves are that good almost everyone I know wears them :)
ukbike,39w8s8,hairnetnic,3,Wed Jun 17 10:32:00 2015 UTC,Done both and I definatly think that motorcycles are worse because of the lack of body movement.  Sometimes in the winter on the bicycle I'll wrap up too much and end up being too hot. In my experience I find a good pair of gloves and a balaclava to keep the chill off my ears and face makes the ride far more bearable.

Every year I see people weaving like crazy with road bikes on slippy surfaces ; there comes a point where it's just not smart. I cheat and switch to the MTB if it's properly icy. No dishonour in walking if needed either.   Biggest winter issue I find (apart from cold hands) is black ice on back roads. I almost made it through last winter with zero falls, and then just got too casual on a cambered road."
ukbike,39w8s8,Mank-onion,2,Tue Jun 16 12:50:01 2015 UTC,It's easier to keep warm on a bike than a motorbike- speed is lower so less windchill plus the effort raises your temperature. I use a tougher tyre in the winter more for puncture resistance (don't want to fix a flat in the cold) than for grip. I have studded tyres for snowy days but I reckon those are mostly overkill for the UK- weather isn't that bad often enough to warrant them (I just can't stand to go to work any other way). When the temperature is low I follow bus routes -they get gritted- and avoid lanes and minor roads.
ukbike,39w8s8,tubbyttub9,2,Mon Jun 15 17:51:46 2015 UTC,The only thing that stops me is full on storms or if it is very icy.  Like loads of people have already said: get some good kit and you'll be fine.

ukbike,39knwf,pikeamus,2,Fri Jun 12 13:00:05 2015 UTC,"In the other article they reference this study which found the opposite was true.     Abstract    A naturalistic experiment used an instrumented bicycle to gather proximity data from overtaking motorists. The relationship between rider position and overtaking proximity was the opposite to that generally believed, such that the further the rider was from the edge of the road, the closer vehicles passed. Additionally, wearing a bicycle helmet led to traffic getting significantly closer when overtaking. Professional drivers of large vehicles were particularly likely to leave narrow safety margins. Finally, when the (male) experimenter wore a long wig, so that he appeared female from behind, drivers left more space when passing. Overall, the results demonstrate that motorists exhibit behavioural sensitivity to aspects of a bicyclist's appearance during an encounter. In the light of previous research on drivers’ attitudes to bicyclists, we suggest drivers approaching a bicyclist use physical appearance to judge the specific likelihood of the rider behaving predictably and alter their overtaking accordingly. However, the extent to which a bicyclist's moment-to-moment behaviour can be inferred from their appearance is questionable, and so the tendency for drivers to alter their passing proximity based on this appearance probably has implications for accident probability.

On average, women reported about 0.42 “near miss” or harassment incidents per mile, compared with 0.24 per mile for men   So this is about perception. If men are harder to scare due to a lifetime of being toughened up by society and by the effects of testosterone, or if they are equally scared as women but don't want to admit it due to male pride, then they would be less likely to report a given incident as a ""frightening event"", even if an objectively identical event ""frightened"" a woman.  I would believe that women get more unwanted compliments but, frankly, compliments don't kill people, and combining harassment and near-misses into a single measurement seems like a deliberate attempt to artificially inflate the risk to women on the roads.   said the difference between genders seemed mainly linked to the lower average speed reported by female respondents   So this isn't even a gender issue, but rather a slow-cyclists issue.

Cycling is fine if you keep your wits about you, so is driving. In control of any vehicle on the road if you don't keep your wits about you there will be an accident.

There is already demand - repeated polls and research show that most people find cycling with motorised traffic on our current roads unappealing and think cycling should get better provision.  I am an optimist - not a defeatist."

Not scary per the original article, but again that's very subjective, I'm pretty sure most new cyclists would never get on a bike again after that.  Those days are few and far between but when there is a wheel almost as tall as you are, 6"" from your elbow, moving 20mph faster, then this is definitely not a good thing....  Largely my own fault for not moving far enough out into the lane. Had I done so then I'd have had more room to evade into - but lets be honest on a 60 limit you really normally try not to stick out too much!"

ukbike,39aa4a,jiminthenorth,3,Wed Jun 10 11:22:17 2015 UTC,"This is all the more so in places such as Cambridge, where parts of the centre are closed to cars and vans.    Whoever wrote this has clearly never been to Cambridge. Or at least not had to work there. Nowhere in the centre is closed to cars and parking is lightly controlled - vans and delivery vehicles are common place. They operate on the 'hazard lights on so parking allowed' philosophy in my experience.   That is perhaps another lesson for the cargo bike industry: it might only become completely mainstream when more areas become cycle friendly.   I think it should be a lesson for city councils rather than the bike industry. The bikes are fine - more than adequate, but the cities themselves are both inviting more people to cycle (because of one-way systems and conventions) which in turn encourages the growth of delivery methods which can bypass the horrendous snarl-ups and horrendous shoe-horned vehicle routes which exist in our old cities (Oxford, London and Cambridge all come to mind), and simultaneously making it harder to do so (by not providing the infrastructure, and my doing little to encourage increasing numbers of cyclists).  I remember watching a documentary on the Dutch infrastructure which ended on the note 'if you build it, they will come'.

You can stay in youth hostels for cheap, they're dotted all over the country.  http://www.yha.org.uk/  Theres also plenty of campsites if you go that way http://www.ukcampsite.co.uk/  You aint taking the bike on a bus, generally speaking.  There aren't many places you're going to need to be taking a ferry either, though I can't see taking a bike being a big problem there.  Trains will take bikes but there's not much room for them on modern trains sadly so space is limited. Also commuter trains (i.e. trains in rush hour) usually have a ban on all bikes, some except folding bikes from this.  As for being stinky, the youth hostels have showers/bathrooms etc. and plenty have laundry facilities.  Theres also the good old fashioned launderette.  Something you'd have thought would have died out by now but they're still about.  Campsites will vary.  Some will have showers and laundry etc.  Others will only have toilets.  You'll have to check that out on a case-by-case basis.  As for bike security well ..... it's only going to be as secure as the area you're in.  I'd keep it in your room where possible.  If camping .... I've no idea!  Chain it to your foot?  EDIT: I almost forgot!

If you want to see some spectacular scenery I would suggest spending some time in Scotland. I have done this route a few times (http://ridewithgps.com/routes/2108734) and can definitely recommend. Another very popular route/challenge is Lands End to John o Groats (commonly referred to as LEJOG or JOGLE, depending on which end you start at). This is basically riding from the most northern point of Scotland to the southern point of Endland.  There some really good advice here about staying in Youth Hostels, and I would echo that. But also, if you're planning out your route before you come over then do searches for local cycling clubs in that town. You might be able to join them for a weekend ride, or get some solid advice for what to do in that area.  As you're in the UK, I'd also suggest spending some time in London. But keep in mind that this won't be cheap and you won't be doing much riding in the city. Some other towns worth checking out would be Bath, Bristol and York. They're in different parts of the UK but they're all great towns, in my opinion.  Edit: I'm not sure what the Visa situation would be for an American in Europe, but you could even pop over to Northern France for a few days if you have time! They're much more cycle-friendly on the continent and accommodation in a small hotel is much cheaper. I'd imagine the cheapest option is to get the ferry from Dover to Calais. I am doing it in a few weekends time with www.myferrylink.com. Their online search function is rubbish, so give them a call to get prices.

When can he drive off? Security, bikes are not locked to the rack. The racks enable bikes to be removed in under 10 seconds. Dirt, rear of buses are very dirty.   Front cycle racks overcome these issues. The big one is the dwell time. They add no delay to the bus schedule."

There is a lot about this that ""looks scary"" but the evidence from America is that they do not impact safety. However that does not mean the safety concerns could not be overcome, but the DVSA were so dismissive and on principle do not want to see cycle racks on the front of buses.

If you have modified your vehicle, the wrong kind of bolt would be all an inspector needed to refuse a certificate... I really can't fathom how this seemed like a good idea to you or anyone.

ukbike,39b5jq,king_duck,2,Thu Jun 11 10:49:54 2015 UTC,"It apparently makes sense throughout the rest of the world. Like I said, the issue is not that something could be done to design out the issues (e.g. a panel shielding the rack when folded up, and a guard when folded down). It's the way the DVSA immediately dismissed the idea of a rack, no matter what safety features it had. Remember racks on the front of buses have been used for over 25 years in the USA. If there was a safety issue they would have been withdrawn. The law suits would have kept them off buses.  From a use point of view, having all buses with racks on the back would be ok, just not as good as on the front."

Then it ends a few metres ahead, and you're chucked back onto the road, in the bus lane, right behind another bus stop (which presumably the bike path was built to avoid...) https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.581711,-2.298067,3a,75y,324.93h,58.68t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sFwhTJ6rVGnEIGt4qBjcMGA!2e0    So yeah...

ukbike,395u83,makeinstall,11,Tue Jun 9 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"Your post is close to the classic anti cyclist rant. Lets see  - ""I ride bikes too"" - Check - Mentioning red lights, despite it having nothing to do with the topic - Check - Road Tax - Nope only two out of three so far, you've deviated from the script there. - Rules apply to cars so should apply to everyone else - check  So back to dismantling your post.  Plenty of logical and legal basis.  Firstly, this isn't the US   Secondly cycles have an absolute right to use the road, unless specifically barred by a legal instrument and those are very rare. It's pretty much only motorways and some bridges - if there's anywhere else I've never encountered it.  Thirdly it's a slippery slope,  start making a cycle lane mandatory and suddenly the chances of other lanes being made mandatory are much higher. The provision of cycle infrastructure in the UK, while substantially better than the US is still utter shite and many leagues behind most of western Europe.  Being forced to use the barely useable, pedestrian and dog walker infested, debris cluttered, giving way to everything excuses for infrastructure that we do have is not something I'd countenance.  If this was to be made mandatory or serious efforts made to do that then I'd expect legal challenges from both British Cycling and the CTC. Followed by civil disobedience and mass rides.  Cyclists aren't the same as any other vehicle on the road and a ""one size fits all"" set of rules doesn't work, which is why there are different rules for HGVs and cars to give just one example.  They are both more vulnerable, and substantially less likely to cause injury to anyone else, and as a result common sense rules that take this into account, as well as the social benefits of cycling vs the costs of using motor vehicles.  It makes every sense to restrict the dangerous and undesirable and to place little to no restriction on the desirable."

ukbike,395u83,makeinstall,6,Tue Jun 9 18:20:26 2015 UTC,"As a cyclist I absolutely expect to have more rights than a car.  Here are some of the things we do when we drive cars:   Take up a huge amount of room, in a crowded country Cause inconvenience by making pedestrians wait to cross. Create congestion and noise pollution. Break up communities due to difficult to cross road. Poison the air with toxic gas.   I am just a person trying to move around my community.  I should not have to compete with cars that are so often inappropriate for the conditions.  Their should always be a presumption in favour of the rights of pedestrians and cyclists before the needs of cars are considered.    Driving in a city is like being drunk at a children's birthday party (really inappropriate).  If you do drive in built up areas you should at least respect the right of people who live their."
ukbike,395u83,7952,3,Tue Jun 9 20:28:22 2015 UTC,"I am not going to bother refuting your points individually.    It really boils down to the fact that different forms of transport inconvenience one another.    Historically driving has had a huge advantage in terms of prioritisation.  It has made communities very difficult to use for pedestrians and cyclists in some quite obvious ways.  It is not about access to the roads but about access to our homes, shops, schools, places of work, parks, and countryside.  We are doing exactly the same as motorists yet are constantly inconvenienced.    Also, this is not a minority concern.  Most people walk around their towns, and in some places (like Central London) pedestrians far outnumber cars.  We all benefit from having towns that are more accessible.  But this can never happen whilst cars enjoy such privilege that so actively damages that accessibility.  Prioritising cars creates an environment where access to the roads is more important than access top actual amenities.    This is particularly important because most urban areas do not have any room left to build more roads.  There is very little that can be done to reduce congestion without inducing more demand.  By continuing to prioritise cars we create a world in which roads eat everything and make our communities completely dependant on them."

ukbike,395u83,d4rti,3,Tue Jun 9 18:28:25 2015 UTC,"/u/fulfilledprophesy already gave you the answer. The logical basis is that cycle lanes are of hugely inconsistent quality, many of them introducing risks that aren't present if you are riding on the road. Now if we had sufficiently high national standards for cycle infrustructure that were consistently implemented it wouldn't be an issue, but that is many years away from being the case.  Law is freaking complicated and we don't even have the full details of the legislation Mr Johnson would want to use to apply these fines. To say that there is ""no legal basis to fight this on"" is pretty stupid when we don't know anything about the details."
ukbike,395u83,pikeamus,2,Tue Jun 9 19:46:35 2015 UTC,"There is no logical or legal basis to fight this on.    There are many potential reasons that such a policy might not be desirable, and to characterise any response as being illegal or illogical without knowing what it might be seems premature.   Any objection would have to boil down to ""We want special treatment for cyclists"". We restrict the hell out of other vehicles in all kinds of areas for various reasons.   The first sentence contradicts the second. Some might say we treat them specially? Special treatment of different classes of vehicles and modes of transportation abounds.  Bicycles for example are not permitted on Motorways. Generally we apply restrictions on specialist lanes, such as bus lanes (often also permitted to taxis, motorbikes and cyclists, but not always); I'm not aware of any car only roads excluding buses etc. In fact, your own example of HOV lanes is one where you may use the HOV lane if you meet the requirements - you are not obliged to.  We also have special tax treatment of low emission vehicles, which have lower or zero rated VED.   It doesn't make any sense to claim that if you ride a bike it should be a free-for-all, make up your laws as you go situation.   No-one is suggesting this. There is no current law or regulation that I am aware of that would prevent a bicycle from using a regular (non motorway) road."

ukbike,395hg4,Robware,-11,Tue Jun 9 11:56:20 2015 UTC,Would that not be assault threatening murder? Would that not be terrorism?
ukbike,395hg4,Robware,8,Tue Jun 9 12:00:14 2015 UTC,"It may well be. However those questions, especially the latter, reek of hyperbole. They're also harder to identify with, and asking relatable questions tends to yield better results."
ukbike,395hg4,Robware,-2,Tue Jun 9 12:13:28 2015 UTC,"Would that not be putting the cyclist in his blind spot?   And that bullshit is easy to identify with? ""Trucker uses a lethal weapon to terrorise a person cycling"". It's not hyperbole, it's technically, legally, literally, and practically correct to view these as assaults threatening some level of force equal to the momentum of the vehicle. From there further classification is whether willful or reckless behaviour and one doesn't hold a 40t truck 10cm off a the wheel of a person cycling for a prolonged period without intent. Nor can a trained driver or anyone contrive a defense that they didn't know it was endangerment.  Perhaps motivated by an ideology where roads were built for cars, people cycling ""don't pay road tax"" or similar, terrorism would also be an accurate classification:   ""violent acts (or the threat of violent acts) intended to create fear (terror), perpetrated for an economic,[1] religious, political, or ideological goal""   I don't think the assailant was trying to help the person cycling with the gradient. I've got legal precedence, you've got rhetorical lazy dismissal and lazy assertion."

On second look it's actually worse, right at the end it looks like the driver is accelerating into the person cycling whilst pushing him along by his backpack. His rear tyre is actually behind the front skirt of the lorry. Now, it's that serious I'll open the door to recklessness otherwise I'd have to go with attempted murder."

So far, puts up to everything I throw at it around York, including terrible pot holes and being dropped more than enough times to mention, although the feeling of indestructibility probably comes from the fact it weights more than a Corsa.   Still manages to get decent enough speed, although maintaining it is an entirely different story.  If you want a good, or even barely okay bike, look past these deals. If you want something cheerful, with a warranty and peace of mind to leave at a station or locked up beside your tavern of choice, by all means."

But then that doesn't solve the problem of how to get it home following the ride...  EDIT: National Express coaches will carry dismantled bicycles, so long as you have them in a suitable protective case (perhaps this one from Decathlon?) and have tickets available that will get you back to London Victoria from Brighton.  I suppose the next easiest thing would then be to board a train at King's Cross to Hatfield, and then cycle/taxi from there to St Albans (the trains running this route are Great Northern).  Sounds like the other services banning bikes has made this entire thing one hell of a ballache.  To cycle from Hatfield to St Albans City is a 6 mile, mostly flat ride, according to Google Maps.  Just depends on whether you'll still have the energy after cycling to Brighton.  EDIT 2:  Suppose that could also work in reverse as well - cycle/taxi to Hatfield and then board a southbound train to Kings Cross there on Sunday morning."

Shitty strips of paving alongside major roads that haven't been resurfaced or swept in years, leading to inevitable and repeated punctures. Confusing signalled junctions that force cyclists to take mind-bogglingly circuitous routes just to avoid holding up cars for even a second.   It's all very well saying 'almost all of the routes will be segregated', but the devil is in the detail.

ukbike,38swak,permaculture,2,Sat Jun 6 15:52:16 2015 UTC,Hmmm interesting. Great that a standard bike is fine for me. Though maybe one with wider wheels would be beneficial. I have found that the tires sometime flatten under my weight
ukbike,38swak,mellett68,2,Sat Jun 6 16:03:19 2015 UTC,"I actually get on better with narrower tyres for that reason, 100psi vs 85psi or lower for a fat tyre.  The higher psi tyre holds its shape much better but can't necessarily take as much punishment, so you have to be a bit more careful.  I've ridden 23mm gatorskins on mixed use trail (some parts rougher than others, where punctures were more likely to occur) for about 4k miles and just replaced my wheels as the rear rim was failing (stock wheels)  My riding weight has fluctuated between 16st and 18st with extra weight on the bike in terms of panniers, backpacks etc.  Hopefully that can give you some idea of what it has been like for me anyway."
ukbike,38swak,smellycoat,2,Sat Jun 6 16:59:21 2015 UTC,Thanks mate. Well I like mountain bikes anyway so thats what I think I will go for. Hopefully when I drop a few stone I can get a racing bike.
ukbike,38swak,pilkismakinmusic,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:41:50 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, at 18 stone I keep destroying bikes. Three frames cracked at the bottom bracket, and several ruined back wheels.  I'm not very careful with them though."

ukbike,38swak,ihaveaclearshot,3,Sun Jun 7 09:43:22 2015 UTC,"I suggest a different approach.  Get a cheap, used bike (maybe a steel tourer or cx) and upgrade once you've lost weight.    At 25st it'll be really easy to destroy bikes, so to save the disappointment and wasted money and treat yourself to something better once you and the bike are ready for it."
ukbike,38swak,hexapodium,2,Sun Jun 7 06:53:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I think this is what I might do. Look for a cheap one until I hit around the 20 stone mark then invest in a good one
ukbike,38swak,ihaveaclearshot,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:48:07 2015 UTC,Would go for an old tourer too. Those things are designed to carry a lot of weight. Mine has carried 18 stone of me and panniers up hill and down dale no problem.
ukbike,38swak,JamesB5446,3,Fri Jun 12 09:55:04 2015 UTC,"Would suggest a Cyclocross Alu or Steel build as not only do they tend to be good all-round bikes, but the slightly sturdier (but not MTB) build and components may give you a bit more confidence.  E.g.: http://www.genesisbikes.co.uk/bikes/adventure/b-road/cda-10"
ukbike,38swak,digdilem,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:55:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate. Biggest problem really is the tires flattening, but people seem to say just pump up the tires more to compensate."
ukbike,38swak,formerwomble,3,Sun Jun 7 09:44:42 2015 UTC,"CX bikes are a good idea (hat-tip to /u/ihaveaclearshot) - if you're not planning on thrashing round singletrack type paths on it, it should be up to a 25st load if you get something aluminium or steel. They're sturdy buggers.   If you've got money to spend on getting a slightly more niche build, consider a tourer - the hardcore ones are built for truly stupendous loads.   Components-wise, perhaps favour bikes with higher-spoke-count wheels: they'll perform better and keep true for longer. 32 and above will be hard to reliably find on anything but a tourer (or custom wheels) but a 28 spoke wheel front and back will do fine, and you can probably go as low as 24 without too much trouble. 20 spokes (and radials of all spoke counts) are probably worth steering clear of though. Disc brakes might help if you're in hilly terrain and are worried about rim heating (they'll also help with rim wear generally) - cabled ones don't fade due to fluid boiling, but you can also get very efficient cooling on finned pads and rotors these days.   Tyres are a personal selection: on a 'cross bike you can probably go up as big as 32c without trouble for road slicks, and even those will go to quite high pressures. The ""15% deflection under load"" rule of thumb for pressures is a good one - graphs here, note that they're marked for per-wheel loads so multiply weights by two for a quick approximation. Offhand it looks like you'd want something like a 28c at about 130psi - which is well in excess of what the manufacturers will tell you to do, but not going to blow up your tyres or wheels. A 32c will be down around a very manageable 100psi or so.  Short version: most cheap aluminium bikes will be fine if you jack the tyre pressures up a bit. A cheap-end alu 'cross bike with cable discs will be a good choice all round."
ukbike,38t7uc,technicalthrowaway,3,Sat Jun 6 16:44:33 2015 UTC,Guess your first step would be to contact the council responsible for it and if you live in the borough then also contact your local councillor.    You can contact your councillor/s with https://www.writetothem.com   and the council officers with   https://www.fixmystreet.com/  Good luck.  Something like this will take months to change and I believe for a mixed use path (pedestrians and cyclists) there needs to be a minimum width though I don't know what that is.

I commute every day in this state (also fasted in the morning), but when I cycle long distances I eat carbs. I used to do it without, so you certainly can, but if you want to go fast you'll notice the difference with carbs.

As borbus said as your diet is low in carbs your insulin response will be higher, your body should utilise them better which is good for recovery.

Each one was also jealous of how I've always eaten what I like but maintained 8-10% body fat (6ft, 67kg). That can look like 500g of dry rice plus veg, 2-3 eggs in a day. Not that I aimed for it but once I came across the idea I learned I've probably always eaten 80-10-10, carbs-fat-protein. Have you noticed an increase in your nicotine or caffeine intake? Intuitively, simulating starvation doesn't seem too healthy of a lifestyle. More carbs, more energy to work, more energy to recover, more energy to work, bigger heart, bigger lungs, more CO2 you can push out per hour?

I am now eating clean (albeit on a low-carb regime), training most days and have cut out alcohol completely. Once I am happy that I have lost the tyre, I will start to reintroduce carbs.

ukbike,38j6h8,bienjamu,2,Thu Jun 4 19:02:39 2015 UTC,"Accomodation wise its going to be a mix between staying with friends, youth hostels and bivvying! If there's somewhere too expensive i'm pretty happy to just sleep under a hedge."
ukbike,38j6h8,Moikee,2,Thu Jun 4 20:51:59 2015 UTC,"if you are heading south from cheltenham take route 41 and then ride across the old severn bridge (even if you aren't going to wales), the footpaths on either side are great so you can go one way, cross underneath and come back the other side.  if you are going to cardiff take route 4 to newport then take the coast road to cardiff, turn north after peterstone if you want to avoid some heavier traffic.  the taff trail north to merthyr is nice and i have stayed at the YHA Danywenallt National Park Study Centre in the brecons and that is good.  i'm not an expert around bristol but in my limited experience if you are heading to bristol follow route 410 to easter compton then route 4 into bristol. avoid the costal A roads which are very trucky.  route 26 to chedder is very nice.   the ride through symonds yat to monmouth is nice if you don't mind gravel paths.  basically any of these routes:  http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map"
ukbike,38j6h8,Moikee,2,Thu Jun 4 16:44:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help.  I've had a look at the map to try and plan some routes, but am not always that enamoured with NCN routes. Though for a holiday they will be fine I am sure. They seem to follow the bizarrest of routes some times especially through towns and cities so I generally ignore them until exiting on the far side.   Touring bike is on 32c tyres so gravel poses no threat other than slowing you down, I have been on hikes round symonds yat a couple of times though. Always worth a look though and they have some lovely tea rooms and the journey across the wye by cable ferry is fun too."
ukbike,38j6h8,_PM_ME_YOUR_BOOKCASE,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:26:58 2015 UTC,I will probably make another post when I am done.  Headed down the 41 today from Bristol and through the mostly flat severn estuary area. Still managed to knock out 2000ft of elevation though somehow.  Went over the bridge which was exceedingly blowy and followed route 4 into Bristol. It follows a weird old route though. Though an under construction industrial estate and then up a very long very steep hill to cribbs causeway.  All good fun though and onwards to Somerset tomorrow!

ukbike,38elrp,sanchopanza,2,Wed Jun 3 18:27:32 2015 UTC,Navigation-wise augmented reality would be really useful. I don't have a dedicated cycle computer but none of the smartphone apps come close to what I really want. The less familiar you are with an area the more support you need and in the end I've ended up stopping to check a map every few hundred yards when the next junction appears.  Safety-wise that's a pile of nonsense. To make cycling safer you need something to prevent the 1 tonne+ vehicles from trying to be where you are and a HUD for the cyclist won't help that.

Well at least they realised their mistake and waited for the paramedic.  At least they appeared to be remorseful, that's something I guess."
ukbike,389ji9,TheAnimus,3,Tue Jun 2 21:25:29 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of drivers underestimate the speeds that cyclists can travel at, they see a cyclist from the front about 50m away and think they have time to make the turn. Either that or I encounter a fuck tonne of malicious arseholes on the road."
ukbike,389ji9,cavendishasriel,5,Wed Jun 3 06:41:21 2015 UTC,"I've had my fair share of apologies from drivers who do this with a hand wave and a concerned mirror expression when I've come close to them after a bad pullout in front of me. Yet at the same time I've had several who've scowled and used the wanker symbol on the mirror at me. Most recent one I was rolling nicely down a hill at 30 and she pulled out about 10 metres in front of me on to the main road I was on from a side junction. I slammed brakes and was inches from her rear bumper as she booted her 1.2 corsa and still called me a wanker.   At that speed if I had been a car we would have collided, at 30mph or so and shed clearly be on the wrong.   So after my ramble in summary: it's both. Arseholes and poor judgement apologetics all around.   It's only since becoming a cyclist I've become a better driver around them and more aware. Having a foot in both shoes really helps everyone. Maybe part of driving test everyone should ride 2 miles around town on a pushbike to see how scary it is when someone cuts you up, brushes far too close. Overtakes then brakes and turns left in front of you etc."

I'll lay it out really simple so everyone understands why the horn went off before I braked.  The Hornit trigger is on the inside of my drops, so, when I quickly moved my hands from the flat part of my bars to my drops to grab the brake levers the palm of my hand pressed the trigger. This isn't usually an issue because I don't have to grab the brake levers in such a way normally.  I will be in fact leaving it this way as it worked out to be quite useful as it helped alert the driver."

That point aside, the car was in the wrong, and yes I agree the focus always shifts very quickly to the cyclists/victims actions - e.g. were you wearing hi-vis, lights, etc."

ukbike,387bfn,mapryan,5,Tue Jun 2 17:19:20 2015 UTC,It is funny reading all the comments about road tax and insurance.  People have this odd idea that if we paid a small amount of tax we would suddenly become more compliant and correctly miserable.  I would be happy to pay a tax if it went to cycle infrastructure.  I already have 3rd party insurance for my own piece of mind.  I still drive on the road and avoid shitty bike lanes.
ukbike,387bfn,7952,9,Tue Jun 2 20:52:34 2015 UTC,"I remember chatting to someone about this not long ago.  The guy had decided to try and push me to the curb, but he was not looking ahead, it was queuing traffic.  I was leaving that road soon onto a contraflow cycle path. So I decided to ask him why?  He said something about tax, it was hard to understand his accent, and my ex taught me no useful Lithuanian, but we finally get to it.  Road tax.  I explain that I own a better car than his, in fact I own numerous cars. Can I not be on the road?  There is no response to this.  I ask him why is he so upset, look at this queue he is in, it's not bicycles holding him up.  Only abuse comes back.  I decide to take my leave quickly as he is becoming more agitated.  I'd love to study this in a suitable environment, but I think the rage comes from bicycles going faster than the traffic.  Motorists don't get the same rage from pedestrians, even if they are breaking the rules (crossing when red, holding them up etc).  It's definitely an area of research that could be interesting."

This confirmed the hypothesis that a driver’s willingness to commit motoring offences tends to be associated with their willingness to commit non-motoring offences – what may broadly be called criminal offences....

They believe this because they mostly do get away with it.  I'd like to think that everyone is a good person and wouldn't try hurting other people because they're being mildly inconvenienced and they're in a large metal box inside which they're safe from repercussions, but we see every day that's not true. Perhaps if actions like this have actual consequences people won't be so eager to abuse and threaten those who are more vulnerable than them.  I cycle that road fairly often, and it could easily have been me almost getting the business end of a Land Rover to the face."

ukbike,3826nv,novelty-socks,3,Mon Jun 1 09:01:57 2015 UTC,"They don't say you should entirely tune-out. Your quoting of only that single line does misconstrue what is said - that queuing in slow moving traffic requires 'less thought' compared to... ""When you are on a fast road you have to think that bit more quickly"".  The point being made is actually that: driving tests taking place in areas of high congestion are seen as easier than those taking place in areas of high-speed traffic. Your angle is a rather generous extrapolation from that."
ukbike,3826nv,Mike_uxo,2,Mon Jun 1 12:20:44 2015 UTC,That's definitely a problem. Cyclists are just one of many reasons that people should be checking their mirrors regularly - what if there's an emergency vehicle trying to get through traffic and the driver isn't checking their mirrors? They'll only hear the sirens when they get closer and it's too late to move out of the way.
ukbike,3826nv,DJ-Dev1ANT,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:11:02 2015 UTC,"I think it would depend on where you are to be honest.

ukbike,3826nv,aWeegieUpNorth,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:52:30 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think you're over-reacting. Being fixated on the car in front is a massive problem for people who aren't the car in front. For example, people who don't pay attention to the vehicles and road conditions further up the stream will be the ones to attempt to overtake cyclists when they have nowhere to go. Who hasn't been overtaken by someone as you're slowing for a red light yourself?"
ukbike,3826nv,ithika,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:59:15 2015 UTC,"If you are not moving you can't do much of anything.  They effectively mean that test in congested areas are edfectively shorter as much time is spent not doing anything difficult, it can be just follow the leader, the driver in a test isn't going to be cutting out of lanes or changing routes etc  Also while you might be looking around and keeping an eye on things the examiner doesn't know that and can't fail you unless you do something stupid,  which will be rarer in traffic than when moving"

ukbike,3808pn,ecstasybread,1 point,Sun May 31 23:12:01 2015 UTC,Especially if it's wet. This was me trying to navigate across a tram junction in Sheffield. Whoops.  It's sort of a weird feeling when your wheels just get completely swiped out from underneath you isn't it.

ukbike,3808pn,Zenigata,3,Tue Jun 2 16:47:50 2015 UTC,"The tram tracks in Sheffield have got me twice, what makes them all the more dangerous is the way the stops are built out into the road  so if you're on a road with tram lines you have to cross the lines at a shallow angle at every stop."
ukbike,3808pn,ecstasybread,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:22:12 2015 UTC,It's a real pain. I don't share the road with the tracks for long so I get myself to the middle of the tracks and stay there. Occupying the lane means you can pass the platforms easily and also gives you more space so you can cross the tracks at a greater angle when you turn off the road. I imagine if you're on a stretch of road with tram tracks for a longer period of time though it could annoy the tram drivers a little.

ukbike,37yjgf,fulfilledprophesy,3,Sun May 31 20:26:28 2015 UTC,The cycle lane on the other side is literally just a bit of paint on the pavement. Half arsed bit of infrastructure and somebody at the council patting themselves on the back thinking it was worthwhile.

ukbike,37yjgf,thornstarr,2,Mon Jun 1 09:12:19 2015 UTC,"This is what really annoys me about cycle infrastructure in the UK. It's basically just a show. I know that Sheffield council for one do one set of things for ""confident cyclists"" and another for the rest. It's not adequate to design infrastructure that is only suitable for ""confident cyclists"" and likewise if a cycle lane is only usable if you're going less than 18mph (plus pedestrians, potholes, stopping at every junction) it's not really fit for purpose."

ukbike,37yjgf,TribalScissors,5,Sun May 31 22:11:39 2015 UTC,"First, when it becomes obvious you can't reason with the gorilla behind the wheel, get yourself out of the situation as quickly as possible. Turn around and go somewhere else if necessary (but not somewhere too quiet, as you still want witnesses). Shouting back, although it seems like the only thing you can do in the panic of being almost killed, is not going to do any good, sadly.  Second, focus on remembering every detail of the incident and the driver, make sure your camera was recording and talk to any other witnesses to make sure they will help you out if necessary.  Third, call the police and make a report of the crime (and it should be a crime more serious than a fucking public order offence... rage!) that's taken place. Then, if necessary, take a few minutes to sit by the side of the road and take some deep breaths. Try and clear the front of your mind of what's just happened and let go of it (without losing the details, tricky!) so as not to damage your interactions with others on the rest of your journey."

ukbike,38066h,ithika,1 point,Sun May 31 22:22:48 2015 UTC,Depends on the scheme the employer is signed up to. Most now can be used an numerous bike shops. You can definitely claim more than one voucher a year as long as you don't go over the £1000 allowance  But you are right.

ukbike,37xzsy,upvote_my_ass,6,Sun May 31 09:59:17 2015 UTC,You possibly could but it'd still weigh far too much. And it'd be a real shame to fuck with a pashley. Pashleys hold their value though so why not sell it and buy a more suitable bike?
ukbike,37xzsy,flippertyflip,3,Sun May 31 12:30:59 2015 UTC,At nearly 50lb in weight I'm afraid I'd just get rid of it.

ukbike,37xzsy,Yacoby,3,Sun May 31 15:18:58 2015 UTC,"50lb is massively heavy. A reasonable Downhill bike would weigh quite a bit less than that.  (In other words, you could probably find something a lot lighter that still would be quite robust)"
ukbike,37xzsy,Robware,3,Sun May 31 16:35:02 2015 UTC,"With what you're looking to achieve you'd be better off buying another bike. You can't fit discs on that bike, and you'd need to replace the rims (read wheels, unless you can build your own) with some that have a brake surface. You may not even be able to mount rim brakes on that bike (unlikely, but possible).  On a similar note; replacing the gear hub will cost lots, too, as it's a new back wheel. You won't get a dérailleur system on (which, again, is a new wheel).  Basically, what you're asking is a complete replacement of your wheels, and possibly adding some new brakes.  You have 2 options:   Get a new bike Get stronger"

I hope there were no lasting injuries. My reason for asking is that looked like Orpheus St, the picture has changed now,  and if so I can only think of one store the truck could be going to. When I delivered to that store ( same shop, different sign above the door ) it was an early morning delivery and we had to be gone by either 630 or 730 (it was ten years ago, my memory isn't that good) before the traffic built up.  If that truck was there during the morning commute then something has changed.  Coop claim to be a socially responsible company putting people before profit. If they made a decision to move the delivery time and place the vehicle in the area during rush hour then I would like to know why. Before I  started asking or throwing accusations around I just wanted to be sure I had the right store, there are a lot of Coops."
ukbike,37pdoj,aWeegieUpNorth,4,Fri May 29 10:22:44 2015 UTC,"Really?  I find the opposite.  Most cyclists in London are generally in their own world.

ukbike,37pdoj,kheltar,2,Fri May 29 11:19:27 2015 UTC,"It's friendly enough, but really a lot of people are just getting from a to b. On the weekends more people are casual cyclists going for a quiet ride and they're more happy to nod and wave.   Commuters and people training hard are more focused, but even so, if you give a nod and they see it they'll respond.   Really you can't be nodding at the hundreds of cyclists you pass on central London or your head would fall off."
ukbike,37pdoj,batty3108,2,Fri May 29 12:11:26 2015 UTC,"This. When I go for longer rides in the countryside, I'll exchange nods with other cyclists that I see - it's a nicely British acknowledgement. But on my commute into central London, or a few laps of Richmond Park, I'm either too focused on avoiding the myriad hazards present or there are far too many others to make it practical.  It's much the same as walking down the road to the station, or going for a walk in the countryside - when there are fewer people doing something and it's evidently a leisure activity, it's more understandable to say hello."

Commuter cyclist who might nod or lift an eyebrow if you greet him, but will tend to ignore you completely. Bloke on a bike with a tinny in one hand, phone wedged between shoulder and cheek, no lights and not even aware he is, technically, a cyclist. Will possibly start a fight if you greet him. Leisure cyclist out for an evening ride. Passes with a stony face and will not even look at you. ""I paid £2,000 for this bike to prove I'm superior to you, and you expect a friendly greeting?"" Occasional bike geek/enthusiast who offers a cheery greeting and a wave - happens about 1% of the time.   The basic thing is, people cycle for all sorts of reasons and don't necessarily feel any kinship towards other people who happen to be on bikes. Personally, I've found the majority of cyclists to be miserable bastards who will look right through you if you embarrass yourself enough to greet them. I get more from joggers than other cyclists.

As many spares and tools as you can think of for the bikes.  Talk to your riders. What do they expect. Sit down and work out some sort of daily rota - do they want ghosting the whole time, or are you free to disappear for an hour to get more supplies, fuel for you, food and drinks for them. Spare clothes, waterproofs, spare shoes, etc etc.  Do something nice for them once a day at least. Just meet them with nice doughnuts. Warm soup. Ice cream.   Keep up to date with the weather and traffic. Be proactive and help guide them. Have good maps and good schedules. Ensure the accomodation is set up so they can just ride in and collapse. (Nothing worse than struggling to reach a checkpoint with the expectation that's it, to be told there's a problem and you've got another 10 miles to go to another place)  Be positive, happy, cajoling.

ukbike,37i8rq,acearchie,4,Wed May 27 20:49:10 2015 UTC,"Clipless pedals are fun, but not entirely necessary.  For five miles, i don't think the exact bike will make too much difference.  Get whatever's fun :)  Kitwise, i'd do five miles in my work clothes and probably not shower, but then maybe i'm gross.  For a five mile commute i'd start to think about mudgards, panniers, and puncture repair.  Mudguards at least on the rear to avoid a wet butt when the road is damp.  If you're wearing dedicated cycling kit for the journey, getting wet won't matter so much though.  Panniers/rack or seatpost bag cos five miles with a bag will probably cause a sweaty back.  I'm happy to do about 10 miles with my messenger bag from time to time, but if it was every day i'd sort something out.  But then if you're changing/showering at work, maybe you won't mind a bag.  It's always worth carrying a pump, tyre irons, and tube around with you, for those days you pick up your bike to head off home and find you've got a flat.  Walking a bike five miles is a pain.  Then there's the joy of cycling in rush hour traffic.  Might be worth looking at something like cyclestreets.net or cycle.travel to find a quietish route.  Though, once you're happy in traffic, going direct on the main road can be preferable.  Oh, also, a decent lock or two (lock both wheels through the frame to something solid), lights and helmet.  Learn how to change a flat, and how to replace the brake blocks.  Change the brake blocks about every six months."

Will ask at Evans cycles next time I'm there if I can fit the panniers one the bike I've got in mind but maybe the easiest option is buying a big old dedicated backpack.   Thanks for the tips on accessories. Will definitely bare those in mind.   I'm quite happy on the main roads.

I upgraded from a mountain bike as I changed jobs and was riding the roads more.  It is classed as adventure road bike,which seem to be getting very popular at the moment. It has disc brakes so will cope with all weathers and plenty of mounting points for mudguards etc. it also has slightly bigger tyres so will also cope with off-road riding.  I went out today around the Sussex  countryside and 15 miles was a breeze. Good luck."

ukbike,37i8rq,mralistair,1 point,Sun May 31 21:30:05 2015 UTC,If you don't have much experience riding in London's rush hour traffic I'd recommend bikeability training (it was free for me).

ukbike,37fgmm,PositivelyClueless,1 point,Wed May 27 10:00:40 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid statistics like this are rather meaningless.  How many more miles are driven by cars than bicycles? The data we'd be looking to compare is ""kills per mile"".       The following statistics show the data for England, not London, but they show that the bicycle to car ratio for distance travelled is 1:50. https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/342160/nts2013-01.pdf  This website (again, England-wide) lists numbers of 1:60 and 1:80.  http://www.ctc.org.uk/resources/ctc-cycling-statistics  Now, it is likely that the ratio in London is more equal than 1:50 and a sample size of one killing by a cyclist is obviously statistically unusable, but to just compare the total number of kills (or injuries) is not correct.

ukbike,37fgmm,Djan,7,Wed May 27 13:01:05 2015 UTC,"To copy and paste a reply from the other thread about this...   kilometres travelled by road user type   This though is the single worst way to calculate dangers between different modes of transport.  HGV are the safest sure, but they stack up miles away from people. When they enter a city, they become the most dangerous mode of transport going (well, other than busses).  Bikes also spend 99% of their times in towns and cities with people so that further compounds the problem of measuring in distance and not taking into account where and how they are used.  Slight tangent - Sure I read somewhere to the space shuttle is actually the safest mode of transport based on distance traveled... but to quote wikipedia ""in-flight accidents have killed 18 astronauts, in four separate incidents"" . Does not sound all that safe, but it sure does lots of miles ;)"
ukbike,37fgmm,Robware,-1,Wed May 27 15:14:55 2015 UTC,"It's not the first time this comes up and it won't be the last time that I get into an argument with people on this. People just don't understand risk, it seems. I cannot find my previous post on this, so sadly, I cannot conveniently cut&paste...      This though is the single worst way to calculate dangers between different modes of transport.      I utterly disagree. Do you have any source for that? Deaths per mile is a common measurement: http://www.cyclehelmets.org/papers/c2014.pdf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort#Additional and many more    I already said that the ratio will differ between urban and cross-country, so extrapolating values is not feasible. But for values measured in the same area, deaths per mile is the best way of comparison.     Your space shuttle example is a jolly anecdote, but hardly enlightening for the case at hand.  1) We are talking about cyclists and motorists killing pedestrians. How many pedestrians have been killed by the space shuttle? 2) Lack of comparability. It's a totally different mode of transport than road transport. If you were to compare the Space Shuttle's risk to its closest rival, you could actually use deaths per mile. Although, with spacecraft and aircraft, the most dangerous moments are start and landing by far, so death per mission would make more sense in this case. The same is not true for cars or bicycles.    Bikes also spend 99% of their times in towns and cities with people so that further compounds the problem of measuring in distance and not taking into account where and how they are used.      So, what do you suggest then? The post I replied to looked at absolute numbers, which is absurd for two modes of transport that are so differently utilised. You shot down deaths per mile, too. So you suggest deaths per trip? If so, I'd like to hear your argument for that - if not, I'd like to hear your suggestion. I suppose ""deaths per hour"" could work better than deaths per mile in some instances, but I have never seen such a statistic."
ukbike,37fgmm,heavymetalengineer,3,Wed May 27 15:40:08 2015 UTC,"I utterly disagree. Do you have any source for that?   I base that on that fact that ""miles"" are too simple a term. If it was broken down into ""populated miles"" or ""unpopulated miles"" I would be fine with it.   So you suggest deaths per trip?    Nope - I would suggest volume. So (off the top of my head) an average city might be made of up 85% cars, 10% busses, 2%cyclists and 3% other. Work out the relative dangers to people that way from the respective modes of transport.

ukbike,37hb2c,heavymetalengineer,3,Wed May 27 17:48:34 2015 UTC,"Best way to climb faster is to ride a heavy bike and your own fat arse up the hills.  Any gains on anything though will be relative, a switch to a light bike/wheels gives you that one off boost.  Train on weight, race light.  More focus need to be put on wheel weight though, cheap bikes tend yo have heavy ones though so is usually the first weight saving you're going to want to do, and they're portable between bikes."

From what you've said you've been arguing with the police over this for a while, did that start immediately following the accident or is that after the 5 year gap?"
ukbike,37bgzh,Jb191,1 point,Tue May 26 12:55:22 2015 UTC,"Hi, Incident happened in 2010. The PCSO called me the next day and said that she had been told by her superiors (the same Inspector per chance?) that she was unable to create a crime report herself, contradicting what she assured me and that I would have to report it myself so I did. Due to extreme stress and the aftermath* I left the country for 6 months. When I returned the Traffic Management Team said they are powerless to help as the incident happened over 6 months ago and I would need to get a Solicitor to investigate. Solicitors kept turning me away telling me to go back to Police. They were treating it as an simple RTA not a crime of driving without due care and attention, failing to provide details, endangering a child etc etc."
ukbike,37bgzh,Jb191,3,Tue May 26 13:14:36 2015 UTC,"As another commenter said, it's not what you want to hear but it sounds like it's doing more harm than good to peruse this, and it sounds like it's ultimately that 6 month gap that's caused you problems. You talk about child endangerment and dangerous driving but to me they don't seem to apply from what you've said. At 'best' it sounds negligent/careless which they're certainly not going to prosecute after a 5 year gap and barely do immediately afterward and with video evidence. You need to move on, it sounds like it's consuming your life. They were careless, and rude afterwards, and it's hurt you which truly sucks. Getting better should be your focus though, not some fight for 'justice' over what is in effect a relatively minor crime, despite its ultimate effects."
ukbike,37bgzh,Jb191,-1,Tue May 26 13:38:32 2015 UTC,Corrupt Police is a minor crime Sir/Madam? There is a lot more in relation to the impact of what happened to me after the incident.
ukbike,37bgzh,condor2378,3,Tue May 26 13:45:23 2015 UTC,"From what you've said it sounds like there's been a mistake somewhere, either the PCSO lost the number plate or never wrote it down  in the first place. That's as far as I think the 'corruption' goes from the things you've said here - everything else seems to relate to you getting nowhere because you have no real evidence that something's gone wrong in the system beyond your word that a witness (were they even in uniform at the time?) wrote something down, a memory that you have from shortly after a nasty and shocking knock.   Like I said before, it's not what you want to hear, but it definitely sounds like moving on with your life would be far more beneficial for you than a fight for 'justice'."

ukbike,37bgzh,LondonChap86,2,Tue May 26 23:38:07 2015 UTC,"Okay so I have a bit of experience with dealing with police and getting them to do something they are resistant too. First of all let me say I doubt it's corruption more likely sheer incompetence on part of the MP and officers you've dealt with (many officers are spot on but like most workplaces some are worse than useless).   Also with the police (and MPs) I've found that even if you think they are the biggest cocks on earth, treat them with the kids gloves until your sure you don't need their help.  Here is what I would do given the timescales...   Make a data protection request directly to the forces information office, relating to yourself and the incident. Don't mention any of your dealings just state you want information relating to case XXXXXXX and any correspondence, if any information required redacting ask for it to be marked and the type of information hidden (give a specific example with a registration number). Hopefully when that comes back you will not only have a log of all the contact you have made, but one of the redacted fields will be labeled registration number. From there I'd contact a solicitor again, with the proof that the police had the information and failed to pass it on... It's unlikely you can go after the driver given it was 5 years ago but I would imagine you can pursue the force if there incompetence resulted in you being unable to pursue a claim. If you have concrete proof and want individual revenge you could also contact the IPCC and in the more extreme cases the press."
ukbike,37bgzh,LondonChap86,1 point,Tue May 26 18:13:15 2015 UTC,"Hi thank you    The MiB report will contain everything as they were given authority to make the DPA request on my behalf. I have copies of the statement by the PCSO and there are clear gaps in the text. I had sent a DPA request to Police myself but it was returned to me as the Police claimed the form was filled out incorrectly - clearly by someone who cannot read.  Redacting the numberplate is withholding/suppression/spoliation of evidence which is a serious crime, afaiu  Solicitors want cash upfront which I don't have! A top law firm gave me no-win-no-fee but as soon as they could not get the numberplate they refused further assistance. I asked again if they would help last week but they said no, again.  Justice is not about revenge! IPCC will take a year or more to investigate and past the statute of limitations, not sure but that's a guess. Waiting for the MiB report before heading that way. The complaint has been investigated by the Met's Professional Standards Department but they fobbed me off too. The proof is in the Police systems which they are refusing to provide. Only the MiB can help here and now but I don't believe they have come across something like this before. If they don't help, the Road Traffic Act 1988 needs to be changed. MiB is more likely to support the Police than me."
ukbike,37bgzh,Jb191,1 point,Tue May 26 18:40:34 2015 UTC,"Then fill the DPA request out correctly, find out what was redacted. You might feel it was filled out correctly, but why pick that fight. Just fill it out how they want it, your whole argument hinges on them having the registration number and you have yet to get them to admit they have it.  Many things in life hinge on picking the right fights with the right people (from my experience), the team that deals with DPA requests for your force holds the information you need to prove what your saying don't get their backs up. I suspect if you've started quoting laws at people you've already shut down a lot of people that could have helped you or at least explained to you what was going on.  Once you proved they have the Reg, then speak to a solicitor.  P.S Also they can absolutely redact seemingly non-personal information (I've had this fight and spent several £1,000 of my own money talking to specialist London based solicitors, ICO are about to rule on one of my longer bouts). DPA is a fairly complex act, they've already stated that they feel giving out the reg is against DP so if it was there it will likely be redacted."
ukbike,37bgzh,LondonChap86,1 point,Tue May 26 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"Hi, I did send it correctly! A new DPA request was sent by the MiB and the response afaik is with the MiB now. Sick of waiting hence starting this post. A VRM is publicly visible information afaic. I'd say the name and address is more private information - they did not redact that. If the law supports suppression of key evidence like a VRM that's already in the public domain/on our streets then that law needs to be changed too, fast."
ukbike,37bgzh,LondonChap86,1 point,Tue May 26 19:23:42 2015 UTC,"Wait for the MIB then but I'd be doing my own DPA request and following it through, information first hand is far better then second hand. Send it by email idealy so you have proof and can appeal any decision.  As I say you might feel that way, someone else might not. At this stage you don't need to know what the VRM is just that they have it.  P.S Looking at the force it's the same one I've just taken to ICO, they are defiantly touchy about their data (I got the feeling they treat any request as a personal attack and look for reasons to throw them out)."

ukbike,37bgzh,cookieofchaos,1 point,Tue May 26 12:19:59 2015 UTC,yes - many - one is afaik the best law firm for cyclists - they say they cannot help without a numberplate. Police claim there is no number plate (which is a lie) and i'm still dizzy from trying everything. MiB only pay if the driver is uninsured or untraced but limited to four years. I've lost everything due to this accident and the aftermath. I've asked the MiB to pay for an MRI scan as feel I could be carrying a blood clot but they don't seem to want to do anything.

I'm not sure people would pay money for a separate, stand-alone device which doesn't offer precise turn-by-turn functionality.

ukbike,37bs5o,mralistair,2,Tue May 26 14:21:36 2015 UTC,I've said as much in my feedback but I agree with London Chap.   If I'm going as the crow flies (for example in London) I'll generally just pick the biggest road or landmark in that direction and make my way - without turn by turn the navigation is largely redundant anyway. You might as well just have a compass.

ukbike,378hv0,gad_about,2,Mon May 25 19:09:58 2015 UTC,"I have the Skiiddii one (your last link). I have no experience of the other one so can't give a comparison but can tell you about this one...  It's fine. I wouldn't say it's top quality at all, but the frame itself seems to be made relatively sturdily. I have reservations about the 'forks' (those plates that go either side of the wheel and take the QR skewer) and the skewers themselves. The forks are just steel plates welded on to the main structure, and one of mine has bent, making it hard to get the wheel in: and the wheels and QRs are just cheap. Serviceable though, but I wouldn't want to go on tour with it: I use it just around town for shopping and parcels etc. Probably load it up to maximum 50kgs at a time.  They're easy enough to tow; once it's up to speed you pretty much forget it's there, even if you have a load on board. However going through bollards or filtering in a traffic jam causes constant mental reminders of ""I'm wider than usual"" :-)  Don't believe them when they say it's easy to collapse down. It probably takes 5 mins, which is fine, but it's a darn sight easier if you have a place to keep it, ready-built.  TBH it's very useful and I'm glad I got one, and if you're going to do a lot of lugging, well worth the money. I justified the purchase to myself by thinking that every time I use it is a time I don't have to use the car instead, and tot up all the petrol I saved. Pays for itself relatively quickly. If I had the money I'd definitely go for a Carry Freedom one in preference but the Skiiddii is perfectly serviceable."

The hardest part for me at least, was getting from the Wey navigation across Guildford to the downs link.  One point to note, keep tabs on the weather prior to going. There's a few parts that will be quite muddy, mountain bike will be fine, when i did it on 20"" x1.5's it was hard work in places.  As for pubs along the way, can't help you out. Plenty of good pubs in Brighton to choose from. Could always phone ahead and ask if they've got somewhere you can leave bikes safely. I was at ""The Hanover"", BN2 8ZB the other week on a Sunday - very good pizzas.

Perhaps if you'd edited the video down to just show those offending bus stops, the faffing at the lights, and any other indiscretions (I recall a give way that should have been set back, but then others were tbf) then I'd probably have agreed with you.

It seems really bulky for what it is - it adds width to the bars, making going through rush hour traffic more difficult. I'm sure it could be engineered so most of the workings are inside the handlebar with just a 5 or 10mm extension on the end of the bar (i.e. just enough for an LED bulb)   I think I'd spend my money on a couple more lights to put on my backpack/panniers, instead of that very specific solution."

The council has a thing for 20mph zones : cheap to implement, make it look like they're doing something. They're also near universally ignored. So forget the final two stages, as it's seemingly more of those, and a few more signs, all done in 'consultation with the local residents'.   City centre : mostly seems to be allowing cycling on one way streets, and probably yet more signs (see reasoning for 20mph zones). Doesn't seem a bad idea, might breathe a tiny bit of life into a rather underused bike hire scheme.   South corridor connects the town/train station to Clifton and Nottingham Trent Uni. This used to be quite good pre-tram, and now it's returning. Useful.  North corridor - I got excited when I saw 'segregation', but I guess they mean extending a currently on/off bus lane on Hucknall Road. It's a section of a main route into town, but not one I find particularly enjoyable. Parts at each end (big roundabout on bottom of a hill, etc) are for confident riders only.  With this route, unless you can get the bus/bike lane the whole way it's not that useful as it's a rather hostile/busy road, and there are big problems with parked cars in the lane."

ukbike,36qp08,LondonChap86,2,Fri May 22 11:04:29 2015 UTC,"riding on the pavement   Plenty of possibilities. Maybe the rider thought it was a shared cycle path (there's plenty of those and they're often badly signed). Maybe it was a shared cycle path. Maybe they didn't feel safe riding on the road, having been a victim of motorist aggression or having known or known of someone who had - that doesn't justify riding on the pavement, but it could well make it understandable.   hitting someone   Not excusable; if you are going to ride somewhere with pedestrians you need to be fully aware of their behaviour.   then riding off   Like I said above - they could well have been in genuine fear of assault. I'm not putting blame on the parents here - the protective instinct towards one's offspring is powerful and admirable. Also according to the article they'd hit come off their bike and hit their head, so there's possible concussion to factor in as well as the adrenaline response."

There's nothing to suggest that it was a shared path - it's not mentioned in any of the articles I've seen. If it was a shared path, or if the rider felt he had to ride on the pavement, then he should have done so with caution. I've seen the video and he's riding fast, despite there being other pedestrians on the pavement. But all of this is irrelevant anyway because it's extremely unlikely it was a shared path.   they could well have been in genuine fear of assault.   Ok, let's say that was the case. What the rider should have done is ride away to a safe distance, call the authorities and wait for their arrival. What the rider did was, allegedly, swear at the parents, ride away and not alert the authorities until the next day where it had gone viral."

CS11 is rumored to be paint one way and a shared bus lane the other. CS7 junction upgrades are failing to provide safe junction and most of money is being spent on pedestrian relm improvements leaving cyclists fighting it out with buses. CS8 Junction upgrades are just paint so far, CS5 inner section will route down busy rat runs as Westminster does not want to give us space. The Quietways are a joke on mostly busy roads with very little infra to keep people safe or encourage any but the brave to take part. The central grid is even worse in that its just as bad as the quiet ways but on busier and less direct roads combined with the plans that are coming so far actually blocking one of the few safe routes for cyclists in Westminster. TFL have dropped there 5% modal share target by 2020 and modal share has been at 2% for the last 5 or so years. So this cycle revolution that Boris promised and the cycling boom that many like to talk about.

ukbike,36apjg,paralel,7,Sun May 17 21:08:28 2015 UTC,"I am glad you are from Manchester, the debate which led me to placing my post concerned a road in Manchester. I was sent a link of an artic cutting up a bike, the driver was totally in the wrong and shouldn't have behaved the way he did. However the bike over reacted and tried to get the truck to stop in the middle of a roundabout so they could have a friendly discussion, when he didn't the rider called 999. During the debate I said the rider shouldn't have been on the road as there was a purpose built cycle path on his left, it seems well designed to me and fit for purpose. Yes it involves giving way at a lot of junctions but stopping and giving way are part of driving. I could go a lot faster in my truck if it wasn't for those pesky traffic lights.    As for HGV drivers opinion of cyclists, our main gripe is we don't know what you are going to do next. Whilst 90% or more are sensible riders there are a few who pull out without looking, change lanes for no visible reason, and behave randomly. Unfortunately they look like the rest of you and so we don't know which ones to trust and which ones to be wary of. With regard to the issue of this post, let me paint you a picture with words... I regularly drive on the A10 from the M25 to the North Circ. Its a 40mph dual carriageway with a parallel cycle path, sometimes a pavement with a sign on, other times a proper cycle path. If a bike is on the road a car can pass and not cause too much danger to the bike, its quite a wide road. If a truck or bus is behind a bike it has to change lanes to overtake safely. This means disrupting the flow of traffic and often slowing to bike speed until a car driver lets us out. Once past we continue 1/4 a mile to a set of lights when the bike goes past us and we have to do it all again. I have overtaken the same bike three times in less than a mile on that road.

It's also clearly too narrow to safely fit two bicycles going in opposite directions. And possibly two more traffic signs blocking the route shortly afterwards, in the direction the camera is pointing. The double ""give way"" to the buildings driveway is the least of the problems.   So that cycle path is neither well designed, nor fit for purpose."

I think as riders we have to concede that if we choose to ride the tarmac here, it's on us to encourage vehicles passing and playing it defensively!  Unpredictability of riders: tricky one this, but sometimes I feel that using the speed and agility of a bike to make quick lane changes and turnings is more effective than the 'vehicular cycling' method. Unfortunately there's not always time for the proper hand signals and glance-backs, but we do try."

ukbike,36apjg,jarlrmai2,2,Tue May 19 07:08:05 2015 UTC,"motorcyclist and cyclist here too, always do your lifesavers, people! they really will save your life!"
ukbike,36apjg,jarlrmai2,2,Wed May 27 23:22:52 2015 UTC,"Looking at that video (and similar ones from other London cyclists), a few things become apparent to me:   The design of our roads forces people cycling into conflict with heavy flows of motor vehicles which is a bad experience for everyone involved With fast, heavy vehicles in the same physical space as vulnerable road users is easy for one person (driving or cycling) to make a mistake that could lead to serious injury or death Generally there are very few other people cycling on such major roads, as cycling for practical transportation is almost extinct in the UK - so car drivers expect roads without any cyclists, and get understandably annoyed at the occasional cyclist where the road is designed such that overtaking safely would be very difficult; this anger ends up directed at the person cycling, they should get out of the way or cycle elsewhere   The only answer is to segregate on the Dutch model with quality cycle tracks alongside such a road, or provide completely alternative routes (which the Dutch also do). There is no real ""correct"" behaviour on a busy road with people cycling as you will be forced to either endanger the person on the bike or hold up a large number of motorists. Sharing road space like this doesn't work, and is unpalatable for 95% of the population anyway. Very few people would cycle regularly on a road like that no matter what other advantages there are to cycling.  Even if there was a ""correct"" behaviour it would be impossible to educate every driver and everyone who cycles how to drive/cycle ""correctly"".  I won't hesitate to say that a benefit of quality cycle tracks is no more bikes in the way of cars and lorries - because it's true, ultimately."
ukbike,36apjg,markhewitt1978,0,Tue May 19 02:01:56 2015 UTC,"However the bike over reacted and tried to get the truck to stop in the middle of a roundabout so they could have a friendly discussion, when he didn't the rider called 999.    The bike? HGV drivers have a really big problem with people cycling, they have a really big problem with dehumanising a person cycling. In no way did the person cycling over-react. I knew the video you were talking of before I even followed the link and I've even met the victim. That was a cowardly and near lethal assault, a deliberate assault and I assume it's because he thinks like you: ""get in the cycle lane"". It was literally and without hyperbole an act of terrorism.  Rather coming here and questioning legal and safe behaviour, perhaps you should be in another forum asking why many HGV drivers and the industry in general kill so many people and show so much animosity. Let's turn it around, why don't you use any of the cycling lanes?."
ukbike,36apjg,markhewitt1978,2,Mon May 18 11:17:01 2015 UTC,"Comments like yours are of the type I usually ignore, but I am going to respond. In fact I have stopped work just so I can type this response, hope I don't get sacked. I am in no way defending the action of the truck driver in that video, he was wrong. He could see the junction ahead and knew which lane he needed to be in so the correct action would be to slow to bike speed and wait behind until they both reached the lights. But you call it cowardly and a deliberate assault, that is tabloid sensationalism. It was an error and an error in a truck is dangerous but it is not a deliberate assault. You call it an act of terrorism, I cannot even think of an appropriate response to that. In big bold letters you ask ""why don't I use any of the cycle lanes"", I don't understand the question. When on my bike I did and will do in the future, when in my car or truck I don't fit and they are not meant for me. Please explain the question. The bike rider over reacted. I say it again because I think it is true. Let me explain... 1. He was a victim of an error that the police would call ""a near miss"" and that angered him, understandably. But one of the principles of road use for all vehicles is you don't let the anger take control, he did. The rider chased after the truck and tried to have an argument with him in the middle of a junction, that is classic road rage. 2. He called 999. That was a mistake. I always advocate complaints but do it in the correct manner. 999 is the emergency number, 111 is for reporting incidents. The 111 operator is fully trained and if they believe it is necessary they will provide a 999 response, if not they will take all the details and help with the complaints process."
ukbike,36apjg,Pornthrowaway78,2,Mon May 18 13:22:27 2015 UTC,"It wasn't an error, the vehicle was deliberately driven at him as a punishment for not being in the cycle lane.  The driver knew the cyclist was there and deliberately intimidated them with their vehicle because they believed that they should be in the cycle lane.  Can you explain how is is not deliberate?  You are preaching to people that have tried 111 and been offered nothing, we've been down all those roads (pun not intended) no-one is taking any notice of this type of dangerous on purpose driving.  One day you should arrange to have a truck driven at you in this manner while you are on a bike, you will know how it feels to be threatened in this manner, It is truly terrifying and the closest I've ever come to knowing my number was up."
ukbike,36apjg,MTFUandPedal,1 point,Mon May 18 13:39:39 2015 UTC,"We see different things Yes the driver was wrong but it I see an error, as did the police who investigated the incident. You assume it was deliberate and assume his motive was punishment, I don't know where that is coming from. I spend my life around trucks, I have been the victim of more close calls than any of you. Non purpose built yards are the most dangerous places for HGVs and I have been hit on the head by a truck that was reversing beside me when the ground collapsed. I have a fellow driver who used to work as a cone man on the motorway, he has had more close calls than either of us (though he said cars are worse)."
ukbike,36apjg,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Tue May 19 07:02:32 2015 UTC,If it was an error what was the purpose of the gesture towards the cycle lane? Why did he not apologise for his error? He must be aware of the potentially deadly nature of it?
ukbike,36apjg,Moikee,2,Tue May 19 07:59:11 2015 UTC,"They only answer I can give is his gesture is the same as my question in the original post. I do agree his attitude is totally wrong and if you read the youtube comments he did lose his job (but for data protection reasons we don't know the reason). How would one apologise for an error like that? I have never been in the situation so I don't know. A wave, a hand over a closed fist, nothing seems an appropriate gesture for an error like that. What he couldn't do is stop in the middle of a roundabout and explain his error to the biker, that would cause more danger to everyone."

ukbike,36apjg,philipwhiuk,1 point,Tue May 19 10:58:27 2015 UTC,"I shouldn't have said the same as my original question,  along the same lines as it would be a better phrase. I was asking for people's motives in choosing the road over a segregated path whereas he seems to be suggesting the bike should have been on the path. A small difference in phrasing with a big difference in meaning. We will never know what the true meaning of the hand gesture  was. The cyclist thought he was pointing to the pavement.  I have used a similar signal to say pull over there.  We can only guess . On my phone again so I will probably have spelt something wrong."
ukbike,36apjg,kheltar,1 point,Tue May 19 11:14:17 2015 UTC,I feel I have to respond here after watching the video.   Firstly to your original question. The cycle lane in the video is terrible. Like asking you to drive your lorry down a dirt path instead of the motorway. Why should you?   But the presence of the cycle path is irrelevant to the incident.   As for the incident the lorry driver didn't 'make a mistake' he very deliberately drove at the cyclist. At the very best he should be charged with Dangerous a Driving and given a ban. There could be a serious argument made for Attempted Murder it really is that serious.
ukbike,36apjg,philipwhiuk,2,Wed May 20 19:00:10 2015 UTC,"Others on here have explained the reasons why the cycle path was not used and you will all be glad to know I  now understand your issues with them. Please bring it to the attention of your local councils so they stop spending our money on paths that wont get used. The deliberate vs error debate  is ongoing in another area,  please state your reasons s for thinking it was deliberate rather than just saying it was.  Why do you disagree with the police  investigation?"
ukbike,36apjg,philipwhiuk,1 point,Wed May 20 19:09:11 2015 UTC,We do campaign to the local council. Especially Gateshead Council where they have a forum for cyclists to give their opinions; which are ignored.   The reason I believe it to be deliberate is that the HGV was fully into Lane 2 and then moved over back into Lane 1 straight towards the cyclist.
ukbike,36apjg,tatch,2,Wed May 20 19:26:22 2015 UTC,"If I could offer useful advice on how to get councils to act correctly the  I would be a very popular man. I have no knowledge of Gateshead but I  bet we could swap a few stories about your local administration and the Mayors office in London. . Back to the clip. The rider was very well equipped with both front and rear cameras. From the rear one you can see the hgv was in lane 1 and moved out to pass the bike. He moved out too close to the junction , he didn't move out far enough,  & he pulled back into lane 1 too early.  All errors, bad errors,  dangerous errors, but still errors. If it was a deliberate attempt to hit him he wouldn't have pulled out at all, the rider would be dead and they cam evidence would mean the driver was in jail ( for about three years given our legal system,  but thats another discussion ). If it was a deliberate attempt to scare him then the truck wouldn't have arced around the bike but would have passed in a straight line with air horns blasting. . . We can go back and forth all day, see the other thread,  but I have heard nothing from anyone on this site that convinces me it was more than a dangerous error."
ukbike,36apjg,zelenoid,2,Wed May 20 20:32:55 2015 UTC,"I think it was a cowardly and deliberate assault. Mr Truckie had all the time in the world, was already taking up both lanes but chose to skim the rider as close as he could for no reason but bullying. I've had the absolute shit scared out of me like that, it is absolutely awful. Calling it an ""error"" is an absolute joke. If I'd have caught up with him I'd have been tempted to try to drag him out of the cab for a face to face discussion about road etiquette.  I can't believe that you would bring that video up to try to reinforce your point. The cycle lane is awful, it's only a 40 limit, so not much faster than a cyclist will be going, there wasn't much traffic on that road and the lorry had no problem with waiting to move over. There was no justification whatsoever for the close pass. None."
ukbike,36apjg,TheAnimus,2,Wed May 20 14:05:24 2015 UTC,"I agree there was no justification for overtaking the bike and the way he did it was dangerous,  I will never defend that drivers action in that incident.  What I disagree with is you see a deliberate assault where as I see a dangerous error.  There is a long thread elsewhere on this page in which another user and I debate the issue, please join us there. I will raise a point here about your comment that the road was 40mph  and that is not much different from the bike. For me 20mph is flat out on a bike though I accept others can go faster. 20 is half of 40 so if we take that fraction and apply it to cars how much of a disruption would a car doing 35 be on a 70mph motorway?  Of course the speed issue is one we can only estimate as given the number of junctions neither the cars, bike, or hgv will be at top speed."
ukbike,36apjg,jarlrmai2,1 point,Wed May 20 18:19:14 2015 UTC,"The driver deliberately choose to turn in on the person cycling before he'd even pulled along side and objectively proven by the video. He saw a person vulnerable to his lethal speed and weight but still turned in on him. This was a deliberate act. It was no accident, he drove in a fully conscious manner. However, assault covers both maliciousness and recklessness, and that's the only area you can contest. It's very hard to prove intent, so I will concede that this was a minimum of recklessness but in doing so still assault.   You call it an act of terrorism, I cannot even think of an appropriate response to that.   What is terrorism? Acts or threats of violence towards a political end. Politics is the science or art of power over people. Violence that seeks to modify or control the behaviour of people is terrorism. If the driver deliberately drove close to threaten a collision to scare the person cycling into not cycling or cycling some place else, that would be an act of terrorism. These people exist and there are various accounts on twitter that collect such threats of violence. Yesterday someone tweeted they enjoyed scaring people cycling with their car. I've collected many myself.   In big bold letters you ask ""why don't I use any of the cycle lanes"", I don't understand the question.   The question is based on the assumption that you don't cycle much if at all, but expect others to use the lanes. If you don't know why cycle lanes are avoided that's a strong implication that you don't use them regularly if at all. Now you get on a bus or a train, and all the seats are empty, but it's full of people standing. What is the first thought? Do you condemn people for being self righteous twats that think they own the gangways? Do you start swinging shopping bags or fists in their general direction to encourage them to take a seat? No, the reasonable first thought should be that there's probably something wrong with the seats.   The bike rider over reacted. I say it again because I think it is true. Let me explain... 1. He was a victim of an error that the police would call ""a near miss"" and that angered him, understandably.   The police can call it assault when they want.

The rider chased after the truck and tried to have an argument with him in the middle of a junction, that is classic road rage.   This is classic victim blaming.

I always advocate complaints but do it in the correct manner. 999 is the emergency number, 111 is for reporting incidents. The 111 operator is fully trained and if they believe it is necessary they will provide a 999 response, if not they will take all the details and help with the complaints process.     Your comments in this thread ooze chauvinism and your argument is ridiculous here. Your second reason for believing he ""over reacted"" was because he rang 999 not 101 (you mean 101 by the way)? That's a nonsense statement so we can strike reason (2) leaving you with (1), which is refuted by police ability to successfully prosecute a ""near miss"" of 2 to 3 feet as assault. Your argument becomes a tautology:    ""The bike rider overreacted and this is true because he was road raging.""   You are asserting your opinion as objective truthfulness and in doing so are being a chauvinist. You are completely oblivious to how obnoxious you really are. At least you aren't as bad as this LGV driver (do read the picture, it's revolting and clear terrorism)."

ukbike,36apjg,br3d,22,Sun May 17 21:26:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for asking :) First, we don't have cycle paths in this country. We have ""shared use"", which is different entirely.  Roads are typically maintained to a good standard, pavements less so. They do not have herds of people with prams, dogs on leads, children, etc on them. They do not have pedestrians who are so absorbed in their phones they can't see or hear anything else. They do not have signs saying ""cyclists dismount"" on them, or ""end of route"". They are not intersected with driveways and roads at which you have to be extra vigilant (not to the same extent as shared use, anyway).  So what you are observing are the cyclists who want to go faster and find the shared use paths very frustrating. Given that bicycles are vehicles too, I have no problem with it - they're allowed on the roads.  Of course, another interesting question is why do motorists seem to (a) want cyclists to use ""cycle lanes"" whenever possible, and (b) park in cycle lanes whenever convenient? Why have I been harassed for using a shared use path (driver clearly thought it was a pavement) and punishment passed for not riding on a pavement (driver clearly thought it was a shared use path).  We should all make allowances for others, even if we don't understand why they're doing something the way they are. If you see it happen more than once, chances are there are good reasons why it happens."

Your complaints about pedestrians are very similar to motorists complaints about cyclists. What about designated cycle paths.

Theres a fucking traffic pole in the middle of it, a bunch of other crap and just randomly narrows.  Not to mention it's a veritable death trap with all the junctions with zero visibility.  Most truck drivers wouldn't last a day until totaling their drive if they had do deal with those conditions. We should probably start putting random poles into the middle of a lane to drive that point home."
ukbike,36apjg,yu3,5,Sun May 17 23:29:47 2015 UTC,"We should probably start putting random poles into the middle of a lane to drive that point home.   Whilst I don't generally support such 'direct action protests' I think it would be utterly fascinating to see the reaction of people if someone put a very sturdy pole in the middle of the road there, instructing cyclists on that cycle path to give way.  I think a lot of drivers have an irrational hatred to cyclists, many in London are shocked when they learn you also own a car or two, I don't think they comprehend why someone would be on a bicycle (much quicker, healthier, cheaper etc) and frankly I think few try to consider the other side of it.  Yet at the same time, just this weekend in fact I'd been delivering a new BBQ to a friends, another friend who had cycled over was actively cycling in a figure of 8 pattern whilst I was parking (he couldn't get into the house).   I couldn't believe it, he was constantly going in and out of my blind spots, making my parking sensors useless, and I couldn't see him 50% of the time..  He knew where I was going to park, but yet when I said Please don't do that, it's dangerous his reply was that he could see me, and wasn't going to let me hit him, what if he had fallen off?  I think too many people think only of one form of transportation, and sadly, this is why I think we really need to have proper separated infrastructure.  I say sadly, because that is expensive and less likely to happen any time soon.  So we really need to try and make people be more curtious of each other.  Every day on my (cycle) commute, I see drivers that make me cringe, and I see cyclists who are frankly being arseholes too."
ukbike,36apjg,ithika,5,Mon May 18 11:56:31 2015 UTC,If the trucks are driven safely and with consideration for all road users then it is all as safe as it can be. If they are not then perhaps the people causing the danger need to address it.
ukbike,36apjg,thegoldenmandenis,0,Sun May 17 22:33:19 2015 UTC,"Its physics. Rigid vehicles have the same views as cars, maybe better as they are higher. Articulated vehicles can see all around when going straight but create blind spots when turning. Unfortunately you cannot have longer rigids as ""tail swing"" comes into effect which is a huge danger to all road users. I could write off another truck with tail swing, imagine what it would do to a bike. ps. don't swear, it detracts from your argument."
ukbike,36apjg,grahamsimmons,1 point,Mon May 18 06:39:33 2015 UTC,"Saying ""It's physics"" that your vehicle is dangerous just makes the rest of us ask the question with renewed vigour: Why are these things allowed into cities at all?

ukbike,36apjg,R2BleepBloop,2,Mon May 18 09:55:27 2015 UTC,One of the common arguments from cyclists is its a shared road and all road users should be aware of cycles and their capabilities.  Its a fair argument and I agree with it. Can I turn it around here and say all road users should be aware of artics limitations and adjust their behaviour accordingly.
ukbike,36apjg,grahamsimmons,2,Mon May 18 17:06:11 2015 UTC,Yeah that's way we always advise new cyclists to NEVER EVER go up the inside of a HGV. However all the advice and behaviour adjustments in the world wont help when a truck driver decides to punish you with a close pass for not being in a useless cycle lane.
ukbike,36apjg,andycycles,2,Mon May 18 18:15:27 2015 UTC,"I know why you'd ask that, but respectfully I disagree with the idea. The massive artic is imposing a danger on people without their consent. Plus, it's all asymmetrical - the truck driver threatens the pedestrian or cyclist far more than they threaten the driver... so if the threat is unequal, why should the vigilance be equal? I'd prefer a system where responsibility is proportional to the threat each person introduces to the situation. Which, I'd add, is exactly what we do with firearms - the person introducing the danger has all the responsibility and we don't ask gunshot victims to do their part. The parallel is comparable, as there are plenty of people who use firearms to get their job done, just as you use a truck to do yours"
ukbike,36apjg,grahamsimmons,1 point,Mon May 18 21:16:00 2015 UTC,"Lots to say, some of which you wont like. All people are aware of the types of vehicles on the road, by joining the road you are consenting to being part of the traffic. The danger is asymmetrical, I have never heard of a truck driver hurt from a collision with a bike (mentally yes but physically no), but I don't like your use of the word ""threaten"". I may be being over sensitive but it sounds like you are inferring intent. A few users on here have accused HGVs of bullying and punishing bikes, I don't know any cases of that nor do I know of any driver that would do it.     Why shouldn't the vigilance be equal? Are you saying that a bike can ride around expecting to be seen at all times? Car drivers do have better vision than Artics drivers (and rigid HGVs have the best views of all) but all drivers only have one set of eyes and the safest attitude is if all road users behave as if the other vehicle hasn't seen them. I have to ask, can you say what you do for a living? Your comment ""Which... is exactly what we do with firearms"" confuses me. This is UKBike, there are not many firearm users here."
ukbike,36apjg,goa7,3,Mon May 18 21:19:32 2015 UTC,"All people are aware of the types of vehicles on the road, by joining the road you are consenting to being part of the traffic.   But I really don't want to. I'm offered dangerous roads shared with huge motor vehicles and nothing else. The fact I use those roads isn't really me consenting so much as me having to go places and using the only option open to me.   ""threaten""   I totally didn't mean this in the sense of deliberate threat, and sorry if that was implied. I meant that objectively, the squishy person on foot or on a bike is in some danger even though nobody wants that.   Why shouldn't the vigilance be equal?   Because the danger each party brings to the situation isn't equal.    can you say what you do for a living?   Let's pretend I'm a farmer, a gamekeeper, or a member of an armed police response unit. If I were, my tool of the trade is something that puts other people at risk - which is also true of a professional driver's vehicle. The difference is that our society for some reason treats the two very differently.   Anyway, of course the real answer to this is some proper safe spaces for cycling. With motor vehicles in one space and squishy people in another, we have a system that's intrinsically safe. But until we get that (and we'd get it a hell of a lot faster if the RHA were seriously lobbying for it - hint hint) my view is that when huge vehicles with blind spots are being brought into urban areas, the people doing that (by which I really mean the industry leaders more than the driver on the ground) should have the responsibility for the danger that brings into our towns."
ukbike,36apjg,pikeamus,1 point,Tue May 19 06:50:25 2015 UTC,"I take issue with your phrasing. I am not accusing any one class of vehicle of causing danger, I am saying separation avoids the possibility of danger."
ukbike,36apjg,chrisj1,10,Tue May 19 07:12:44 2015 UTC,"I think you'd find a lot of support for separation here, at least done properly. It rarely is, as it costs money and inconveniences other roads users.  Personally, if I'm not using a cycle path, it's probably because I think it's more dangerous than the road. I'd rather have a safe 10mph than a faster but riskier 20mph, I care more about safety than speed.  For what it's worth, I see people cycling on 40mph roads where there are perfectly good paths, and while I support their right to do so, I think they're crazy."

ukbike,36apjg,jarlrmai2,2,Sun May 17 23:18:13 2015 UTC,You are entirely right. The Dutch use a separation hierarchy so that bicycles don't share with heavy or fast moving traffic. But they also build cycle paths well which we don't in the UK.

This is similar to the comments I get from other HGV drivers about cyclists, maybe there is a pecking order that I am not aware of? I don't accept the problems of stopping at extra junctions to be a valid reason for not using a designated cycle path. Stopping is an integral part of driving and should be an integral part of riding as well. I know its hard work accelerating up to speed again but every type of vehicle has problems it has to overcome inc. different acceleration capabilities, different cruising speeds, different stopping distances, different visibility, etc etc. The reason for the cycle path is safety. Segregation means no contact, no contact means no fatality."
ukbike,36apjg,ithika,10,Sun May 17 22:34:18 2015 UTC,"Your point about stopping is a bit off. As a driver, If you were given the choice of a straight road with few junctions and one with loads of junctions side by side you'd choose the former. It's the same for cyclists. if time is important you want to keep up your average speed so stopping every 25m for a junction is utterly rubbish.  If the traffic designers used a bit of Dutch design they'd give priority to the cycle lane and make drivers give way when turning across them. Do that and they'd be far more popular with non-leisure cyclists."
ukbike,36apjg,sffubs,5,Sun May 17 21:19:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it's not just the stopping, it's the priority. Some of the local cycle paths have turnings every few hundred yards (off a 40mph road), and then driveways in-between. As a cyclist you absolutely can't assume drivers will stop for you, no matter who 'has priority'.   It can't be compared to car driving, because they have airbags and crumple zones and anti lock brakes and I have, well, bones and maybe a helmet."

Segregated except at the extra junctions they would have to cross.

It's obviously a second class lane as users of the cycle lane are obliged to give way at every side road while users of the main road aren't. If it were really about safety then you could still have a cycle lane but the side roads would have to give way to it, and traffic on the main road would also have to give way before turning across it. That would be much safer.  And don't pull out your bizarre argument that stopping and giving way is just part of using the road, because that doesn't justify in any way the fact that cyclists on the cycle path would have to do it far more than if they remain on the main road. In fact, each of those junctions creates added risk and probably means the cycle path is more dangerous than staying on the road!"

So it would be like if they built a special HGV lane on the motorway to get slow moving lorries out of the way of the cars that want to travel at 80mph. Sounds ok, but when you try to use it you realize the HGV lane leaves the motorway at every single junction and you have to give way to cars joining the motorway, and every few miles it just ends without warning and you have to merge with the normal lane.   That's pretty much what most cycle lanes feel like."
ukbike,36apjg,heavymetalengineer,4,Mon May 18 08:08:38 2015 UTC,There's very little evidence that off-road facilities are safer though!

Also frequently they are poorly maintained, lots of pot holes, strewn with debris, making them impractical for thinner tires (lots of punctures).

The increase from 40 to 50 is only used on certain roads, or should only be, the often used comment ""its a limit not a target"" applies in a HGV more often than others realise. It increases safety for car drivers. I used to get long tails of cars stuck at 40mph who would attempt a risky overtake out of frustration. the increase has reduced the frustration and many cars now wait until it is safe before passing. 2. The ""discussion"" on youtube is one I tend to avoid, I often just pull out of such discussions once people start calling each other names. If I remove the insults and distil the discussion to the points it seems the bike thought the truck was too close and overtaking on a blind hill. He was too close, as was the van but that passed without comment as the wind from it was less, and should have pulled over more. However for the HGV driver that may not be a blind hill, we can see a lot more than you realise and even when a hill has a sign saying it is blind or a dip that is marked hidden we can see clearly. I would have to drive on the road to be sure.    My main problem with that discussion is the attitude of the participants. Insults and name calling achieve nothing."

If I had a choice of a 20min ride on a path or a 10min ride on a road with trucks and buses I would choose the path.   You're looking at it the wrong way. If you were in your HGV and you had the choice of making a journey almost entirely on a motorway, or going through a town centre with narrow streets and traffic lights, you'd choose the motorway every time,  wouldn't you? That's the equivalent comparison.   Cyclists don't use these cycle lanes because they are almost always designed by people who have no idea what they're doing. They have no real benefits other than maybe keeping you away from traffic, but at the cost of being forced to dodge pedestrians (as others have said, they are extremely poor at being aware of cyclists even on paths with green painted surfaces and bike signage everywhere) and crap surfacing and miscellaneous other obstacles. Would you use a path that randomly switched you from one side of a road to another every so often? A path that stopped and started in arbitrary places? A path that would force you to be weaving around people who don't know or care that you're there? A path that forced you to give way to virtually everyone and everything? A path that was so narrow that if you met someone coming the other way you have to awkwardly squeeze past each other? A path that expects you to cross a busy road in an unsafe place? A path that sometimes seems custom designed to annoy you (eg the ridiculously narrow barriers sometimes set up at the start of cycle paths that are barely wide enough for a pair of handlebars)? A path that is never gritted in winter? A path that took you on a needlessly indirect route?   What you're seeing in the refusal of many cyclists to use these lanes is the same sort of attitude that leads pedestrians to cross a road between traffic instead of using a proper crossing 50m away. It's more convenient, it's faster and it's quite safe if you take care about what you're doing. The only real source of danger is from bad drivers, and if there was any willingness on the part of the police to enforce the law we'd have far fewer of those on the roads to worry about.   I have to say I don't entirely buy your concerns about safety, I think you would just like cyclists to get out of your way. Fair enough, but you might want to consider that if you are able to overtake the same cyclist 3 times on a given stretch of road as you mentioned elsewhere, they're not holding you up at all, because if they were you'd never see them again once you got past the first time. If you want to get where you're going more quickly, the real solution is to significantly reduce motor traffic levels, not to kick cyclists off the roads. Cyclists aren't responsible for the twice daily rush hour gridlock."

If I had a choice of a 20min ride on a path or a 10min ride on a road with trucks and buses I would choose the path.   It's a bit more subtle than that. Many people would choose a 20min pleasant ride on a path, rather than a 10min ride on the road. However, being forced to go slowly due to regular hazards - junctions, debris, pedestrians - is unpleasant. Roads are designed for wheeled traffic to move on them at speed, and so lack many of these hazards, making them a more attractive place to ride. Of course, roads come with traffic, but traffic is largely predictable, and actually pretty safe. Being able to ride faster is just a symptom of using better infrastructure.  And, of course, many people will take the 10min commute over the 20min one, regardless of what it entails.  In any case, I completely disagree that riding a bicycle on the road is an unsafe activity. I certainly don't believe that I'm any safer on a typical UK cycle path."

Turning creates blind spots and on a roundabout I cannot see the left hand side of my trailer. if I was to use the right hand lane then when leaving the roundabout I would be moving into a lane blind and would destroy anything before I knew it was there. Artics have to use the left lane coupled with a right hand indicator all the way round the roundabout so we can see everyone.

You've come and asked a question and instead of accepting the answers from the people who know what they're talking about you keep telling them why they're wrong and why you think they should be doing what seems most sensible from your POV.   From my experience following cycle paths and lanes gives me nothing but trouble. In fact it was from following a cycle path that led me to the point where I had my first accident recently (which was 0% my fault). The cycle path stopped and turfed me out onto a busy 4 lane gyroscopic junction. That was on my 5 mile commute home. It gave me about 40% cycle lane coverage from the door of my office to the door of my house.   I now take a different route home giving me between 15 and 30% coverage (depending on if I execute an awkward manoeuvre at a roundabout and then use some shared path or just stick the road) and I have had far less contention with these new routes, least of all being when I have been on the road choosing to use the least number of cycle lanes.   Cycle lanes have not been planned with practicality and convenience for the cyclist in mind in the UK. They are not acceptable and often times will sacrifice the cyclists safety seemingly to make them easier to implement. They are mainly added to get the cyclists out of the way of the motorists so they can get on their way without having to think too much about how they are piloting their vehicle."

I bring this up because it highlights another problem with cycle lanes. Even if they are safer than using the road (and I don't know if they are or not), they often stop when the road gets busy leaving you to fend for yourself. It really outlines the attitude to installing bike lanes. It certainly doesn't seem to focus on safety.   Personally I think the hard shoulders on motorways should be made into HGV lanes.

Matrix signs are 10 mins behind on responding to the problem and police or traffic womble help can take longer. I would never agree with it. That said I if it was the system in place then I would have to follow the rules and use it, there are lots of stupid rules for HGVs that car drivers are unaware of and we follow them all ( most of us do). There is an idea going through the motions that the M11 should be a no overtaking zone for HGVs so cars can pass easily, fair enough but we only need one horse box or crane lorry (or a Tesco driver trying to get overtime) and you end up with a procession of HGVs doing 45.

And why is that? because crossing a lane of faster moving traffic at an awkward angle would make it hard to judge if it was safe to pull across etc? And because you'd have to slow your lorry way down to double and triple check before pulling across? And then you'd be quick slow accelerating off and be ""exposed"" across the junction for a longer period than would be nice.  Do you see the parallel I am drawing here?  This is the issue I have with you saying ""stopping is just part of driving"".

It is difficult to follow the tone of a thread when I am jumping around between them. The extra danger on exiting the motorway comes from car drivers failing to estimate our vision and stopping ability, they cut in front at motorway speed so close I can read the stickers on the back window. Add to that motorways have a higher percentage of left hand drive trucks and the cars would be approaching on their blind side. I see the parallel you are trying to make, its not exact but I see your point. A closer one would be letting vehicle currently banned from motorways use the hard shoulder, ie tractors, mopeds. Having slow moving traffic that close to lane 1 would be a constant danger and if I understand you right would be a parallel to slow moving pedestrians alongside bikes."

ukbike,366y0d,thevershg,2,Sat May 16 19:27:14 2015 UTC,Have a look at Audaxes - if you can do 120 miles already then you'll be fine doing the 200km events...and you can probably start on the 300/400km events as practice for 200mile days.  Think I personally wouldn't have 2 complete days off but rather two easier days of say 30-50 miles to keep it all ticking over.

ukbike,361sfe,bbhertz,6,Fri May 15 11:21:42 2015 UTC,That lane width is going to be interesting with the speed variance of commuter cyclists
ukbike,361sfe,jarlrmai2,2,Fri May 15 11:55:52 2015 UTC,"If you look at the plans, though, that's just a narrowing that occurs as the bike passes through the bus stop area...an area that is likely to have crossing pedestrians and should require slowing anyway.   It is wider in the normal areas.  I think it goes from 2 meters wide to 1 1/2 meters wide near the bus stops.  2 meters should be plenty wide for passing."
ukbike,361sfe,senseandsarcasm,1 point,Fri May 15 23:43:22 2015 UTC,"Not just the speed variance, but the proximity to pedestrians. I like to ride two or three feet out from the kerb to avoid pedestrians. This gives zero opportunity for that. SSDD"
ukbike,361sfe,Pornthrowaway78,0,Wed May 20 14:08:55 2015 UTC,"That speed variance in large part comes from people having to compete with motor vehicles to get through junctions, past buses etc. As that is removed everyone should be going a sensible pace."
ukbike,361sfe,Slartibartfast87,6,Fri May 15 12:28:24 2015 UTC,"What counts as a sensible pace? Because it'll just be whoevers slowest.  Part of the reason I rode a bike when I lived in London is that it's quicker than public transport, and with the vast numbers of cyclists on certain routes at rush hour the standard paint on the road superhighways weren't wide enough.   I fear this will result in a bit of a mess, and plenty of cyclists feeling they have to use the road instead, then getting grief for not being in the lane."
ukbike,361sfe,CressCrowbits,0,Fri May 15 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying there won't be overtaking, but the mad rush at a junction - in order to assert road position - is surely removed when the route is segregated.   For those who want the journey to be as fast as possible, well, good! But the road will still exist for them.   It depends where I'm going, which bike I'm using and so on, as to which I'd use."
ukbike,361sfe,Slartibartfast87,1 point,Fri May 15 20:05:38 2015 UTC,Most of the people I come across in town asserting their position at the lights are asserting it in front of other cyclists.
ukbike,361sfe,Pornthrowaway78,1 point,Wed May 20 14:12:50 2015 UTC,"Heh... Rest assured, if you cycle outside of London, where there aren't 20 cyclists at each light (just 20 additional cars), the motor vehicles are still the primary reason to assert road position."
ukbike,361sfe,Slartibartfast87,5,Wed May 20 17:21:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm I don't know. You might be right but I think it'll take a lot more cycle infrastructure before we see that effect - people joining the segregated cycle path for a short distance will still be in racing mode!  I also think quite a few cycle commuters enjoy going fast, especially when you've got an hour plus commute as it can make a lot of difference time wise. Probably also a consequence of our lack of cycle infrastructure as you say but it'll take a while to change this. Shouldn't be a problem if the lane is wider elsewhere, I hope it's not this width everywhere."
ukbike,361sfe,goolies,3,Fri May 15 12:45:47 2015 UTC,"I agree. There needs to be enough segregated infrustructure that a wide variety of people are comfortable going out in normal clothes before the racing mentality disappears. I will personally miss the opportunity to get a workout in on my way to and from work, though it'll be worth it if we can reduce the noise and air pollution that all the traffic creates."
ukbike,361sfe,pikeamus,4,Fri May 15 12:49:04 2015 UTC,I hope you are correct but I can see the lane being ignored by faster cyclists due to it being impossible to overtake.
ukbike,361sfe,jarlrmai2,3,Fri May 15 13:27:54 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, would ignore.  My commute is over 15 miles each way.  It takes a bit over an hour.  If I rode at the speed of a significant portion of the bikes I see it would take closer to 2 hours.  It won't matter as my commute is largely on the CS7, so no real changes for me."
ukbike,361sfe,kheltar,2,Fri May 15 15:42:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you're (and I) are part of the 1-2% that are currently cycling. This type of infrastructure is targeting the 30%+ range."

ukbike,361sfe,kheltar,3,Fri May 15 20:05:57 2015 UTC,"But... Are we that majority? Yes we want proper cycle infrastructure, but when you're in 'long distance as fast as possible' we're not going to be catered for by mass cycling infrastructure.   I have no problem with that. And this style of infrastructure is infinitely better than what we currently have, but they're building transport routes, not racetracks. Something that you can go 12-15mph on is the aim, not 18mph+"
ukbike,361sfe,Slartibartfast87,2,Fri May 15 20:10:12 2015 UTC,"I just said I understood your point, and said it's good they build infrastructure for slower cyclists. I think you may have misinterpreted that."

The one pictured is designed to make you cycle in single file at the bus stop bypasses - weird. It's 2.0m wide elsewhere which is wide enough for overtaking. 2.0m(one-way) is standard practice in NL and you can cycle as fast as you want on most cycle tracks. When they get very busy however congestion is fair enough if you think about it. This is why 2.5m wide (one-way, 4.0m two-way) paths are recommended in NL."

Cars can be be confiscated with persistent offending over a 12 month period. It's perhaps useful to road justice in terms of statistics but I judge it as just another level of impunity before it even gets to the points system, which again only leads on to more points, then maybe a ban, then maybe no ban because ""my job depends on it"".

There are others (such as safety devices) which help but in my opinion the three main ways are identifying the people/companies involved, educating and segregating.   I am 100% against a blanket ban on lorries in London/other cities for a long list of reasons. In 2 above I expressed a need to identify the vehicles involved. Not all HGVs are involved in these incidents. You all have access to the internet and can research the fatalities in 2015, they all involved smaller trucks. 2014 was similar. A blanket ban would punish the people doing it responsibly whilst others would find a way round it (construction vehicles need to be there in the daytime because that's when construction happens). A ban is not feasible as the trucks have nowhere to go. Where do they wait until the curfew is lifted? A ban is not feasible as the extra costs would be passed onto the consumer and I dont think you know how much that would be. Its huge. A ban is not desired by shops and they have more influence over TFL than cyclists or drivers. Shops like people to buy things and you cant carry shopping on a bike, not safely. Shops want trucks doing deliveries in the cheapest way possible and people to walk out with as many purchases as possible.   I despise newspapers. They are not NEWSpapers, they are STORYpapers. It used to be large attention grabbing headlines to increase sales and now its clickbait to increase views so they can sell advertising. Anyone who bases their knowledge on the Daily Mail (& others) is just repeating sensationalism. You are all online, research facts before posting quotes. This leads me to...   I am constantly reminded of the death of Barry Meyer & Alan Neve incident in Camberwell. From the information I have read in newspapers there is no defence for this man. From what I have read he should have been charged with manslaughter. From what I have read the operator should have been charged with corporate manslaughter. That man was a HGV driver and was banned because he wasnt good enough. He had 5 driving bans. He had a history of driving whilst banned. From what I have read he was an arse. If he was a cyclist he would be the type that rides on busy pavements at speed. If he was a golfer he would be the type that hits the ball onto the fairway before the previous group have moved on. There is nothing I can say other than please dont think all HGV drivers are like that, I dont know one who will support him.    There has been a debate elsewhere in reddit about safety devices and aids like the one in the OP. They help but are a minor answer. In my opinion education and altering of driving & riding style is the major one. I think they should be added, along with eye level indicators along the side of all vehicles, lights on all bikes, cameras on trucks. Also everyone should have a dashcam/helmetcam. But dont expect these to solve the problems. Identify the types of people/companies involved, educate, and segregate. In my opinion this will reduce incidents more than aids and devices. As an example of how safety devices do not solve the problem consider buses. They are the same size as trucks but only have 2 small mirrors and no safety devices, trucks have 6 mirrors and can have cameras, proximity sensors, etc. Yet buses are involved in far fewer fatalities that trucks.     That will do for now, I have more to say if prompted."
ukbike,35terr,mitch1975,2,Fri May 15 11:40:33 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for bringing this thread to my attention.  I'm cycling to commute in London, normally crossing the city east-west. I've witnessed very dangerous situations in these last 4 years and in one case I've been hit by a car not stopping at a roundabout.  Anyway, back to your comment:   your opinion is -at least for me- very valuable, personally I've rarely seen any HGV/LGV driver intervene in these discussions and normally most of the threads end up in the same usual cicrlejerk we know. To me the problem are not HGV/LGV drivers, rather how the urbanisation and viability is done by TFL and sustained by the various borough: there's to say that some vehicles are less adapt for urban driving than others, especially regarding visibility. Some others can be deadly on impact, which is normal when you're comparing the moving weight and breaking power needed. Cyclists end up being in a very disadvantaged position when it comes to these terms, there's nothing to do about it. given the above, it is clear that segregated lanes are the most sensible solution without impacting too much on the traffic and the urban layout. This is a solution that is proven to work if followed properly. Before saying whether I'm in favour or what, I'd like to point out that roads near construction areas are particularly dense in terms of tipper lorries and massive vehicles. This means that the chance of passing by one of these is very high, compared to any other road in London (I was used to pass by Victoria and that's an area I'll wholeheartedly suggest to avoid for this very reason). The TFL have the insights (or at least it has led me to believe that) to understand which areas and which construction sites can potentially be dangerous if not deadly: if this is the case, a ban could be required. I do not support a 24/7 ban as it would be stupid in a city as big as London, but it might alleviate the problem temporarily and applying it only during peak hours should be enough in most cases, but this is just a very wild guess. But in any case it's a temporary, selective ban where the traffic or some part of it needs to be strictly regulated. Once again, it's not a final solution, just until segregated lanes are put into place. clickbait articles are how these magazines are getting any money.. .and we fall for them every time. :P I don't think there're exceptions to be made: if a cyclist is being a jerk and driving recklessly I'll try to educate him however I can, I don't condone his/her attitude regardless if he/she's a cyclist. Same goes for any other driver. As a generic rule on the road you're responsible for your and other people's life as we all share the same piece of tarmac... In any case there's no rule ""all X are jerks"", it could be easy to make but not always the case. safety devices might be OK, as are high vis vests, lights and respecting the rules. The TFL (specifically) and the boroughs need to more proactive when is coming to viability and use of the roads, and as far as I've seen there's no silver bullet to this in the current situation, aside the segregated lanes (which of course won't get rid of idiots jumping street lights or raging drivers ramming you from behind)   Thanks"

I usually only go on the site when I am bored whilst waiting to be loaded (about 1/3 of my shift involves sitting on loading bays, approx. 1/8 is statutory breaks, up to 1/4 involves waiting, it is surprising how little of my time involves driving). You obviously found the post and replied to my first comments but I don't think found the thread I was referring to, I was asking about the use of cycle lanes. I have had a few interesting responses and am going to put up my first post. There are questions to be asked and I would like to hear the answers.    It appears we use the same roads. One of my contracts is store work and one of the stores is in the back streets of Pimlico. My route is A41 into London, across the A501 and onto Oxford St, turn right to Marble Arch, left down Park Lane, over Hyde Park Corner (not literally) and on to the Crossrail work at Victoria, left towards Parliament Sq, turn right on Artillery Row... from there on it gets complicated, its ""fun"" in an artic.. The reason I am saying this is your point about construction. I know that route in huge detail, I know each corner, I know each junction. Construction vehicles do not, they are new to the area and only there for a month before moving to a new site and a different set of vehicles service the works. I believe this knowledge is one of the reasons certain types of vehicles are involved in less incidents than others. Buses know their route, delivery drivers know their route, non London drivers are wasting x% of their attention on their route resulting in 100-x% on traffic."

You are calling for a ban on  the wrong vehicles.   Supermarkets run 100s of HGV vehicles day and night in London and 1000s UK wide yet have the best safety record of any road user.

ukbike,35terr,mitch1975,1 point,Fri May 15 03:21:50 2015 UTC,Artic.  Shortened term of articulated.  ie has a bend in it. In the UK it usually means a cab and a long trailer but can also mean a rigid vehicle like in the youtube clip towing an equal size trailer. HGVs no longer exist. The term was changed to LGV a few years ago. However  LGV is ambiguous as it means Large Goods Vehicle  and Light Goods Vehicle so many still use HGV. It is getting the terms right is what I am trying to get you to do. Otherwise if you did get your way and ban HGVs then qualified drivers with a proven safety record  (tomorrow ) will be punished and there will be upto four times as many smaller vehicles like the Aberdeen one you showed me. How will that make the roads safer? . . Ps.  zzzzzz zzzzzz zzzzz

ukbike,35befb,JamesB5446,3,Fri May 8 19:43:05 2015 UTC,No. It's mainly a problem of bad road design.  Bad bus design comes into it too though.
ukbike,35befb,stinkyball,1 point,Sat May 9 07:14:26 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing. Motorized mirrors would seem to be a good first step.
ukbike,35befb,kheltar,3,Fri May 8 21:30:36 2015 UTC,"I can't watch this, it's just the same old shit. Look how dangerous this vehicle is, but that's an acceptable cost of doing business.   Some bus drivers are careful and some are absolute cunts. Aggressive overtaking and bullying behaviour is sadly too common. I take the lane with buses behind me so they can't overtake now, any overtake I've seen has been unsafe."
ukbike,35befb,irishgeologist,7,Sat May 9 10:38:48 2015 UTC,"Victim blaming from the start. 50s in says the cyclist is invisible. He's not invisible, just the bloody bus hasn't been designed properly! When he says ""do you see what the issue is?"" I would have said ""yes, cyclists are expected to share the road with these vehicles!"" But yes, I concede that this kind of demonstration can be useful - if only it was reversed."
ukbike,35befb,ithika,3,Fri May 8 21:35:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, where does this guy think they put bike lanes??"
ukbike,35befb,Hitman__Actual,2,Fri May 8 22:45:12 2015 UTC,Remember a 4.5m & even regular bus lane is considered by many LA to be safe approach. Guess what the bus cant see you most of the time!
ukbike,35befb,novelty-socks,2,Fri May 8 18:24:01 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of this video about lorry blind spots. Watch it, it's only 45 seconds and you'll be astounded.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzL0Kyk4m-8"
ukbike,35befb,iomex,1 point,Sat May 9 12:10:40 2015 UTC,What a waste of time. Stop spending money on this shit and start building some proper fucking infrastructure that doesn't force cyclists to share space with 10-ton buses.
ukbike,35beah,yourealwaysbe,2,Fri May 8 18:21:58 2015 UTC,"I seem to spend a lot of time lately waiting for large vehicles to negotiate their way around each other while muttering to myself, ""come on guys, why are you so wide!"""
ukbike,35beah,kheltar,2,Fri May 8 23:59:56 2015 UTC,"I've recently got myself a road bike, after years of cycling on my hybrid.  While I was held up before, now it is a near constant issue.  I can fairly easily ride 20-25mph when the conditions allow, and am continuously forced to ride more slowly by drivers for a variety of reasons that wouldn't effect me as a cyclist.    People that can't seem to drive or don't know where they're turning, are looking for a park, or who randomly decide that they'll stop to let a car in front of them (despite there being no fucking car behind them - just me on my bike).    Those who pull out in front of me without looking, onto a narrow road where they're immediately forced to give way to oncoming traffic I could easily have gone past.    People who move over when they're blocked by a car in the middle of the road, despite having significantly less than a car width, and then blocking the remaining space on the road....  However the other day I was riding down a 30mph road, doing easily 26/27 mph (and being maybe 2 or 3 car lengths behing the car ahead) and was shouted at by a passing motorist."
