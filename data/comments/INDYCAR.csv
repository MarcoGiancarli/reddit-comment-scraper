Drivers risk their lives for our entertainment. If they want to spout off about the good and bad, they should have every right.

INDYCAR,3e293z,TardisKing,9,Tue Jul 21 12:00:28 2015 UTC,"Aside from Rahal and Colleti, I'd say I'm really surprised by Will Power and Gabby Chaves.    Will Power - I fully expected Power to repeat as Indycar champ this year. Instead he's faded badly down the stretch. Since the 500, Power has finished 4th, 18th, 13th, 4th, 19th, 22nd, and 10th. This despite being on pole three times. I expected better.    Gabby Chaves - One of the things I love about Indycar is that it makes rookies prove themselves. No rookie sweeps into current Indycar and starts winning right away. Sure enough, Chaves hasn't won. His best finish is 9th. But, crucially, Chaves hasn't had a single DNF this year. That's huge, both for Chaves' development and for BHA's bottom line. I don't think he'll develop into a superstar like I expect Newgarden or Karam to, but he'll be a steady, stable force for the future of Indycar, which the series needs to balance out the likes of Karam and Sato."
INDYCAR,3e293z,Hoffgod,11,Tue Jul 21 15:01:42 2015 UTC,"In Power's defence, he's had some really bad luck this year.  Getting stuck behind a stalled car at Long Beach, rain strategy by others probably cost him the win in the first Belle Isle race, electronic issues in the second Belle Isle race, got wrecked at Fontana, got wrecked at Milwaukee."
INDYCAR,3e293z,Sallum,9,Tue Jul 21 15:20:19 2015 UTC,"Rahal for sure.   If you told me at the beginning of the year that JPM would have been the only championship leader and that Pags wouldn't have a win with Penske yet this far into the season I'd have been pretty surprised too.  Also the new aerokits weren't everything I was hoping they'd be. Still puts us in a better place than we were before them though, in my opinion.   Also: NEWGARDEEEEENNNNNNNNNN!"
INDYCAR,3e293z,pmhaddad,9,Tue Jul 21 15:12:52 2015 UTC,"Montoya surprised me as I had honestly written him off from winning a championship in anything, but he's been absolutely incredible this year. Definitely one of the standout drivers like Rahal and Newgarden.  Honda's struggles to get on top of their aero was surprising. Before the season started, I thought the F1 style wings were going to destroy the simpler Chevy package, while Chevy would have the superior engine. Instead it's been a complete Chevrolet walkover for the entire season."
INDYCAR,3e293z,SensationalDuke,6,Tue Jul 21 15:25:46 2015 UTC,Resurgence of Rahal and struggles of Andretti autosport are the two biggest surprises for me.
INDYCAR,3e293z,sushant008,7,Tue Jul 21 12:35:56 2015 UTC,"While Andretti has struggled, give Marco some credit. He's finished every lap this year, had 10 top 10s (out of 13 races), four top 5s, and is 7th in the points. While it isn't at the level of Graham, it is still very impressive"
INDYCAR,3e293z,goodguygleenn,5,Tue Jul 21 16:04:10 2015 UTC,How about Hawk? He has been a disappointment this year.

INDYCAR,3e293z,MiniAndretti,5,Tue Jul 21 17:12:24 2015 UTC,I think they know their cars aren't that great. Sato has to drive extra Sato-ey to get the most out of his cars and do what he can to get them relatively near the front

INDYCAR,3e293z,XSC,5,Tue Jul 21 18:17:00 2015 UTC,"The on-track product this year, as has been the norm for Indycar over the last few years, has been sensational, with the NoLA race the only exception. From Barber to Indy to Fontana, Milwaukee, Iowa, heck even Detroit was a decent showing this year. Compared with other major open-wheel series (cough, cough- F1- cough, cough), the lack of predictability has been very refreshing. The variety of tracks really has shown through this year in my opinion, and I think it would be a damn shame if we lose more ovals.   The competition really has been very good as well, with (save Colleti, I'm afraid) almost no classic Milk and Doughnuts backmarkers like years past.   My only complaint is how ugly the cars are. Really are hideous, BUT with the racing as good as it's been, I'll be willing to give it a pass."

INDYCAR,3e293z,greenslime300,4,Tue Jul 21 17:04:42 2015 UTC,"Pagenuad has been disappointing. He's just been off the pace compared to all the other competitors and he's actually been somewhat invisible this season. Montoya struggled in his first season as well but at least he showed signs of competitiveness and won a race.  RHR was having a terrible season before his win but maybe he's turned it around...or he just really likes Iowa.  Hinch's injury was a surprise. Was not expecting a driver to miss the season due to injury. Oddly enough, a similar thing happened in NASCAR too. It is nice to see Briscoe back though.  EDIT: I forgot one. Vautier and DCR getting a 4th!"
INDYCAR,3e293z,Sallum,3,Tue Jul 21 15:28:50 2015 UTC,Pagenaud has been shockingly bad once the races start. Saturday was yet another example. He qualified 5th and finished 14th. He dropped like a rock when they waved the green.
INDYCAR,3e293z,MiniAndretti,4,Tue Jul 21 15:58:39 2015 UTC,"I think the best surprise has been the competition this year. Aero Kits were supposed to favor the big guys at Penske, Ganassi and Andretti. Sure, they have wins but we've seen a lot of teams get wins. Penske, Ganassi, Andretti, KV, SFH, Schmidt; it has been a great season for competition.  Rahal and Newgarden are finally starting to show the Indycar world what is up. I really hope Newgarden can get into a top seat in the next year or two. I hope RLL can expand to two cars signing a really good driver to pair up with Graham.  My biggest disappointment has been AA. Sure they have two wins but they have otherwise been nonexistent. They're getting stomped by a one car team.  This season has been awesome so far. We've got higher viewed races and I think we as fans can do a lot to help the series. Encourage new viewers from F1 and NASCAR and be positive to people looking for information when it's their first race."
INDYCAR,3e293z,Mikemat5150,4,Tue Jul 21 15:09:20 2015 UTC,"I think CFH can be a top seat. They have team chemistry out the wazoo. But CFH isn't going to get a sweetheart deal for next year.  Penske is on lock down but Ganassi has a seat in flux with the #8(This isn't Sage hate. Contrary to the thoughts of some, I don't hate the guy.). Andretti will come calling, hopefully, with a sponsor in hand.   I bet CFH will get to make the first offer to Josef. Hopefully, they have a big name sponsor on board to help pay him. He's going to be looking, rightly, for whatever kind of deal Pagenaud got."
INDYCAR,3e293z,MiniAndretti,3,Tue Jul 21 15:48:16 2015 UTC,I do think they can be a top seat but i don't think it can be year in and year out like the others.   I think Sage will be back but on Trackside they've mentioned TK's sear a couple times so that may be in flux soon. TK is 40 and with the new Ford GT program he could do the 500 and Le Mans.
INDYCAR,3e293z,Mikemat5150,5,Tue Jul 21 15:57:44 2015 UTC,"Andretti Autosport has trouble attracting sponsors for drivers not named RHR and Marco. That's the tough part about Newgarden being a possibility there. If I were Newgarden and AA wanted to talk, I'd want to see a signed letter of intent from a sponsor.   Life at CGR is a little different with only half the Target money flowing in. NTT is Tony's sponosr.   I think what CFH needs, besides a solid sponsor, is a better plan for the 20(Is Fuzzy's coming back next year?). Ed and Luca are both very good at their respective disciplines but that can't help the cohesiveness of the team. They need to see if Luca can be competitive on an oval."
INDYCAR,3e293z,MiniAndretti,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:56 2015 UTC,I don't know if it's just a disparity of language but TK didn't bring NTT Data so I would call it Ganassi sponsor and TK drives the car.  I do agree though. Andretti has done well with RHR and Marco but the others not so much. They've had many drivers lined up to drive but no money. I think that CFH does need to get a sponsor on Newgarden's car. If they can't find something after this year then they're doing something wrong. I think if they can keep the cohesiveness between Fillipi and Carpenter they'll be good. Changing drivers every year probably hurts more. I would love to see Luca race on an oval.
INDYCAR,3e293z,Mikemat5150,2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:45 2015 UTC,I remember they had to get the okay from NTT Data to switch TK to the 10 car with Target sponsorship last year after Dario retired.   Maybe TK didn't bring them but it sounds like they came on board because they were promised TK was going to drive the car.
INDYCAR,3e293z,MiniAndretti,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely, I think they wanted a big name driver. 500 winner and champion definitely fits that bill!"

INDYCAR,3dz2t8,Dont-quote-me,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:27 2015 UTC,"From a marketing perspective yes.  There is no need to lower the bar. But Newgarden and Rahal winning races is a big deal. It will help draw American eyeballs to IndyCar. Once they come they will see how hard they have to fight with the likes of Dixon and Montoya to win races.  The new fans might become fans of Dixon, JPM, or Power. But the sell job just to get them to look is easier if some Americans are just as good.  ""Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser!"""
INDYCAR,3dz2t8,MiniAndretti,2,Tue Jul 21 15:29:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's a lot easier and more appealing for the media to write a story about a young American kid winning races than some random European or South American or something. Obviously we all want the best drivers in the world in IndyCar, regardless of their nationality, but I think it's a lot easier to ""sell"" a winning American than a winning foreigner.   We don't necessarily need Americans in the series, what we need is good American's in the series. Someone like Davey Hamilton? Meh. But guys like Sage and Newgarden with tremendous racing talent are what are going to sell headlines.   I know it's a very different situation, but think of all the attention Jeff Gordon brought to NASCAR in the 90's and 2000's. A young American kid taking the fight to stock car veterans!   Sadly, none of my friends care about NASCAR, or even racing at all for that matter, but if I asked them to name a race car driver, I can guarantee 9 out of 10 will say Jeff Gordon."
INDYCAR,3dz2t8,-internets,3,Tue Jul 21 18:26:16 2015 UTC,"I think Indy suffers from more internal and PR problems than they do known drivers.  The races keep coming and going from the lineup before anyone gets a feel for the track, or worse they buy into crappy races and kill the drivers in the process.  The reason (again, IMHO) Gordon was recognizable was the fact that he had character and talent, and wasn't an arrogant cowboy.    Helio did more for racing being on Dancing with the Stars than Danica did strutting for Go Daddy, because he was a genuinely nice guy.  If some of these new guys, (and some of the younger veterans) can't figure out how not to be a jerk post-race or off track, that will create a lot more work for them and Indy.  I also watch hockey.  That is also a sport packed tight with non-Americans, but it doesn't effect their likability because they have a single vowel in a 36 character name.  They are popular because they are talented, but aren't dicks about it."
INDYCAR,3dz2t8,Dont-quote-me,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:41 2015 UTC,"I also watch hockey, and have played my whole life and I think you make an excellent point about all the foreigners in the NHL. I will say though that marketing in hockey relies a bit more on the team overall than individual personalities. Patrick Kane was (and still kind of is) a dick. But he's loved in Chicago because of what he does for the team.   If in some alternate universe, Kaner was a race car driver and acted the way he does, I doubt he would be very popular with the fans. This obviously is also highly debatable, but I really believe there's some truth to that, don't you?  Anyways, back to my original point though, I don't think there's any denying that Sage fits the exact description of the driver fans have said IndyCar needs for the last decade. Whether IndyCar really does need such a driver is up for debate, but whether or not IndyCar does, Sage is still the perfect example of such a driver."
INDYCAR,3dz2t8,-internets,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:53 2015 UTC,"I will say though that marketing in hockey relies a bit more on the team overall than individual personalities.   Good point.  I have on more than one occasion said, ""yeah he's a goon, but he's our goon."" (Not Kane, goons in general.)"

INDYCAR,3dyp9j,Yoshiman400,2,Tue Jul 21 11:51:01 2015 UTC,I haven't watch Formula E so I can't comment on that. All I know is he was second in GP2 and has a good number of wins in lower series. He also drives sports cars which means he is pretty versitile.  I think it would be interesting to see what he could do after some testing. When he drove at the 24 hours of Daytona he was one of the fastest there.
INDYCAR,3dyp9j,bullet50000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:56:35 2015 UTC,Definitely a heck of an accomplishment. But because of double points at Sonoma I wouldn't necessarily say it'd take an epic collapse on Montoya's part. He only needs to beat him by a normal margin of 12 points in each of the last three races.
INDYCAR,3dyp9j,chirstopher0us,5,Mon Jul 20 19:33:46 2015 UTC,"Scary thing is that if he wins the last 3 races and gets 2 bonus points, he'd actually win with nothing on Montoya's part, so he's got something of a shot. Not necessarily realistic, but we'll see"
INDYCAR,3dyp9j,crashcarson15,4,Mon Jul 20 21:36:42 2015 UTC,"tl;dr of the below: Graham can do it, but he either needs to nearly sweep the points from here on an amazing run, or with a more realistic but still excellent finish, he needs JPM to struggle for podiums. Even a single win for JPM without a near-sweep of the rest of the points by Graham and it's difficult to see.   He's trailing Montoya by 42. If Graham were to sweep the points from here (pole, win, lead a lap, lead most laps) then even if JPM finished second and led a lap of each race, he'd still lose the championship to Graham by 7 points. Winning is pretty highly rewarded by IndyCar points.  For a somewhat more realistic take, let's imagine a great finish for Graham: a win and a 3rd in the next two races and a double-points win at the finale in Sonoma. Suppose he leads a lap at 2 of those and leads the most laps at one of them. That would net him 189, meaning Montoya needs 148 to win. If JPM finished third in each of the last three, he would need to sweep most of the bonus points around to win it.   Let's suppose Graham wins the crucial double points finale, and manages two third place finishes at Mid-Ohio and Pocono, with 4 bonus points for lap-leading. JPM needs 133. Finishing 4th in each race and a lot of the possible bonus points would be enough.  Given the obvious and non-negligible disadvantage of Honda over the year, second place would be more impressive than JPM's championship winning season to me; a very serious achievement."
INDYCAR,3dyp9j,EMINEM_4Evah,3,Mon Jul 20 23:46:34 2015 UTC,"Remember that with double points at Sonoma, the difference between first and third is 30 points; if Graham (or someone else) can trim his deficit from 42 to 29 over the next two races, Montoya can lose the title even while finishing on the podium.  He’ll need a strong run next weekend at Mid-Ohio though to do it; you’d expect JPM to have a strong run at Pocono."

INDYCAR,3dyp9j,shinkhi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:45:14 2015 UTC,After the disaster the start of the season was for Honda powered cars to even be talking about one winning the title is huge even if it is a long shot.  Nice to see the teams starting to figure out the package for the ovals and get both manufactures to be competitive.  Now Honda just needs to get the street package locked down.
INDYCAR,3dwzyf,thequietone710,13,Mon Jul 20 05:59:29 2015 UTC,And then comes the half year hiatus...

INDYCAR,3dwzyf,fleshwound_NPG,4,Mon Jul 20 12:13:27 2015 UTC,"I hope that INDYCAR, or Hulman Group, or Boston Consulting, or whatever group of deep thinkers is making the calls here has been listening to the fans' voices the past year or so, and the current atrocity of a schedule will not be in place in future years.  While it accomplishes the immediate goal of not competing with football, the long layoff, followed by a series of races in quick succession, does no favors for race teams, spectators, broadcast partners, or tracks.  It all seems so rushed and, at the end, so pointless.    Clearly, work needs to be done to expand the season, into February, at least, and, maybe into September or October to tracks that are not in big football markets.  Or, even, abroad.  But, six months is too long a layoff, I don't care for whom.  We need our INDYCAR fix all year 'round -- or as close to that as we can get it!"

INDYCAR,3dwzyf,korko,4,Mon Jul 20 15:21:53 2015 UTC,"Yep.  It's long past time for Indycar to kick ESPN/ABC to the curb. The only time they acknowledge Indycar's existence is during the month of May, and I'm so sick of them holding the 500 hostage."
INDYCAR,3dwzyf,Hank_Scorpio74,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:36:44 2015 UTC,"ABC/ESPN extended their contract through 2018.  That said Disney has told ESPN it has to make major cuts to account for the loss of subscribers over the last few years.  With ESPN losing it's last major motorsport, the NHRA goes to Fox after this year, they could lose interest in keeping the 500.    Or they could double down on it and bring back RPM2Night live from Indy.  I doubt that though."
INDYCAR,3dwzyf,lennysundahl,3,Tue Jul 21 13:46:18 2015 UTC,"I really get the feeling that NBC honest-to-God gives a shit about the sports they cover. Racing, football, hockey, other football, Olympics, it all has a quality that the other networks lack IMO."
INDYCAR,3dwzyf,spatchbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:28:11 2015 UTC,"You know what folks. I saw how NBCSN covered the Nascar race through their online HUD. It was remarkable. To be honest, I was blown away. If we could introduce these qualities across every motorsport. I think we would see a gigantic boom in audience. These kinds of things are going to revolutionize spectator experiences."
INDYCAR,3dy8ac,jezzadickandjim,7,Mon Jul 20 14:43:18 2015 UTC,Yup. It's all about Sponsors.  There's only about 4 cars that look the same every race
INDYCAR,3dy8ac,InvisibleTeeth,4,Mon Jul 20 14:54:53 2015 UTC,Definitely makes it harder to follow IMO.
INDYCAR,3dy8ac,InvisibleTeeth,4,Mon Jul 20 15:10:12 2015 UTC,Even Nascar has different sponsors almost weekly.   Keep in mind. F1 teams are owned by billionaires and factory teams in which they don't need full car sponsors. The sponsors they have are more driver sponsors than teams. Plus the economy is Europe is far different than that in the US.   Nascar and IndyCar for example are supported by sponsors. Better there be a slew of sponsors than a team not existing at all.
INDYCAR,3dy8ac,d0re,2,Mon Jul 20 15:15:55 2015 UTC,"I've never really followed NASCAR much either, how much do their liveries change? I know I've seen them with slightly different color schemes but generally they have similar liveries from week to week right?"
INDYCAR,3dy8ac,chirstopher0us,3,Mon Jul 20 15:58:56 2015 UTC,"In NASCAR, most teams will run two or three sponsors during the course of the year, so they will have three ""normal"" liveries and then maybe 4-5 races do ""special"" schemes.  A couple examples:  Kyle Busch is sponsored by M&Ms (Mars). His main livery through the year is the green Crispy M&Ms car. Mars also promotes their other products such as Skittles, or Doublemint gum, which may take up a few races. They also generally run a Halloween livery around that time since that is one of the biggest times for Candy.  He also is sponsored by Interstate Batteries for a few races (maybe 6-8?), so he has a separate scheme for that.  All in all, Kyle Busch will likely run around 6-7 liveries throughout the 36 race season.  Denny Hamlin is rare in that he has Fedex as his sponsor for almost every race. However, they promote the different units of their business by having different colored paintschemes. They mostly have the same themes but will change secondary colors from green to orange to purple, etc."

INDYCAR,3dy8ac,TardisKing,3,Mon Jul 20 16:54:27 2015 UTC,"One reason you may have had that impression is that 15 years ago or even 10 years ago, NASCAR liveries were much more consistent. Then a couple of guys starting having changed-up liveries for certain events. Now just like in Indycar its about putting sponsorship packages together for the whole season, sometimes from more than one sponsor, and its about whatever product the sponsor wants to promote that weekend, so almost everyone changes."
INDYCAR,3dy8ac,-internets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:44:45 2015 UTC,"You do see it in non-factory F1 teams though, for instance last year Williams brought out a full-car White with Blue and Red stripes when they got Martini sponsorship and Sauber changed to a Blue and Yellow livery when they got Banco de Brazil. I kind of bet we would see a McLaren livery change if they ever manage to get a title sponsor."
INDYCAR,3dy8ac,crashcarson15,2,Mon Jul 20 18:10:41 2015 UTC,Totally agree. Unfortunately the general lack of funding in IndyCar makes it a necessity for now.
INDYCAR,3dy8ac,tjsr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:47 2015 UTC,Two of which are the (sadly) sponsor-less Coyne cars :(
INDYCAR,3dy8ac,-internets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:31:30 2015 UTC,"It’s a little off-topic, but I really hate how both cars from a team have to have the same livery in F1. I love being able to look at a car and identifying it straightaway; it’s what bothers me so much about Coyne’s cars this year.  All the different liveries in IndyCar keep you on your toes, I suppose. I’m a huge mark for aesthetic design in sports, so seeing new sets every week is something I like."
INDYCAR,3dwzvo,Hoffgod,11,Mon Jul 20 05:58:33 2015 UTC,Goddam right IndyCar fans! Lets keep this sport growing!
INDYCAR,3dwzvo,-internets,5,Mon Jul 20 07:11:13 2015 UTC,I'm really curious what effect the next race at Mid Ohio is going to garner for ratings. Obviously a bit of a different sell to NASCAR fans but hopefully enough people have liked what they see to tune in.
INDYCAR,3dwzvo,Mikemat5150,7,Mon Jul 20 13:01:21 2015 UTC,"I don't have that much hope for Mid-Ohio TV ratings. Partially because it's on CNBC but mostly because it'll be going up directly against Sprint Cup at Pocono on NBCSN. Still, it'll be a worthwhile comparison. Last year, under similar circumstances, Mid-Ohio drew a 0.25. This should give us an idea how much of the ratings increase is the NASCAR bump."
INDYCAR,3dwzvo,Mikemat5150,4,Mon Jul 20 13:22:35 2015 UTC,I realized that after typing. I'm hoping with Hungry being this weekend and then they're summer break we can draw in some F1 fans. We'll have to do some promoting here on Reddit!
INDYCAR,3dwzvo,shinkhi,2,Mon Jul 20 13:25:35 2015 UTC,"F1 fan here... I'll be watching Mid Ohio live. I don't watch ovals live, I record them and fast forward through the middle, stopping at restarts and then watching the last 20 laps or so."
INDYCAR,3dwzvo,Mikemat5150,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, that's a start! Watch out though. I came from F1 and wouldn't really care for ovals but the more you watch, the more amazing it gets.   I don't know if you're in the states but seeing them in person is amazing. Especially super speedways."
INDYCAR,3dwzvo,shinkhi,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:53 2015 UTC,"I battle with it, going back and forth from watching them to not having the patience for them. I love the racing series, I go to the St. Pete Grand Prix every year... just not a big fan of a hand full of tracks."

Half of that is Sonoma because it's double points this year.  (Don't blame me, it's not my idea).   Will Power has won 3 of the last 5 at Sonoma.  The other two were a 10th where he led the most laps and a 2nd."
INDYCAR,3dxrmg,emersonlakeandlagoon,4,Mon Jul 20 12:56:25 2015 UTC,Dixie and/or WillyP will cut a huge chunk of that lead at Mid-Ohio...unless we get another surprise like Kimball in 2013.

INDYCAR,3dxrmg,goastnoats,3,Mon Jul 20 18:31:25 2015 UTC,"Double points at Sonoma means Montoya can be 29 points ahead going into the final race, and lose the championship from the podium.  Then again, Dixon, Helio and Will all had one hell of a shot Saturday to put themselves properly in the mix, and they all flubbed it. They’re still in the race — because those are the more likely guys to win 2 of the last 3, which is what it may take — but might need another JPM retirement to make it happen."
INDYCAR,3dxrmg,crashcarson15,3,Mon Jul 20 16:31:13 2015 UTC,All it takes is one more DNF and he could he in second. If he has anything go wrong at Sonoma it could be anyone's ball game.
INDYCAR,3dxrmg,Mikemat5150,2,Mon Jul 20 12:59:37 2015 UTC,"Montoya has been incredibly lucky this year. Every time he's had a bad finish, his rivals have managed to do the same. You can't rely on luck, he needs at least one more really good finish to pad his lead for me to say he's going to win."
INDYCAR,3dxrmg,furiousjorgey,2,Mon Jul 20 13:03:36 2015 UTC,"Anything can happen as we saw this weekend but, Sonoma is one of Montoya's best tracks and he won Pocono last year. If you were another driver with a shot at the championship you would probably be wishing they were about anywhere else. He also has a bunch of Penske teammates that will help if they can."
INDYCAR,3dxrmg,leaknoil,2,Mon Jul 20 16:05:06 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons I feel like double points for the final race is absurd. He'll have led the championship the entire season and can't go into the final round with any comfort room. Hoping he finishes strong to the season to wrap up a great year. Besides Rahal's late form, no one else has driven a champions season."

INDYCAR,3dsudq,-internets,4,Sun Jul 19 05:38:47 2015 UTC,Because Ed was slow
INDYCAR,3dsudq,MJDiAmore,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:53:20 2015 UTC,Because Karam chopped his line completely unnecessarily twice.    I'd have been fine if he raced clean after the 1st one.  The second one was absolutely penalty-worthy.
INDYCAR,3dsudq,trygame901,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think Karam ever chopped Carpenter. He pinched him coming off of the corners a couple times, but they never actually made contact.   You can also see when riding onboard with Carpenter that he drove down to the middle of the straight when he was waving at Karam, forcing Sage to turn in from basically the bottom of the track. It's not like Ed was racing really clean either"
INDYCAR,3dsudq,mreatsum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"You don't need to come all the way to the wall though, even if you've turned in at the bottom.  There also doesn't need to be contact to constitute a line chop."
INDYCAR,3dsudq,korko,3,Mon Jul 20 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't think you would be able to keep one of those straight at those speeds without stuffing it in a corner."
INDYCAR,3dsudq,CurvyVolvo,2,Sun Jul 19 04:06:43 2015 UTC,"Ed did it twice. First he flipped him off, then he shook his fist at him. The latter was in the corner. The full video is posted above sorting by best."
INDYCAR,3du5xz,MiniAndretti,3,Sun Jul 19 14:33:46 2015 UTC,I have more but this one shows how close you are. It was just to the right of start/finish.
INDYCAR,3du6hm,Mikemat5150,7,Sun Jul 19 14:39:36 2015 UTC,He'll be better next season if he can keep his seat. I did expect a bit more from him on roads and streets especially with a teammate to help with data and setups.
INDYCAR,3du6hm,MR_Rictus,6,Sun Jul 19 14:46:17 2015 UTC,The problem with Coletti is that he's always been fast but wild. Even in his 4th year in GP2 he was making absurd moves and stupid mistakes. I don't see another season in IndyCar helping that.
INDYCAR,3du6hm,Salamander17,3,Sun Jul 19 14:47:53 2015 UTC,So Sato jr?
INDYCAR,3du6hm,XSC,2,Sun Jul 19 15:19:15 2015 UTC,"Fast but wild is good for the series and fun to watch.  Sato, Paul Tracey, Kyle Busch...  But if I were an owner I'd want to avoid it unless I had a very dedicated sponsor.  A driver like that will get a lot of airtime and cost a lot to support."
INDYCAR,3du6hm,rushclay,4,Sun Jul 19 18:55:05 2015 UTC,"a cut/paste of a previous post a month ago on a similar topic  Ah, the 2nd KV Racing car...  2012 - Rubens signs on, becoming a teammate with fellow Brazilian TK. Buddies for life? Nope, was wanting out by mid-year, looking for other teams/sponsors (sadly, never found anything and retired). 12th in points.  2013 - Simona signs on, and by mid-year her manager and Kevin/Jimmy were at odds with one another, ending up in a lawsuit (which was dropped). 13th in points.  2014 - Saavedra signs on, and only had two instances where he showed anything...but fucked them up horribly (Indy GP, Iowa). Dead last among full-time drivers.  2015 - Stefano...past halfway of the season and has multiple DNFs and has shown nothing special. Dead last among full-time drivers, possibly losing his ride by seasons end.   Two instances in the DW12 era where the 2nd car was any good, and they scared away the talent.  One day Kevin and Jimmy will finally realize that they are just a one-car team disguised as a two-car unit. Until then, expect the next victim in 2016 to do the same."
INDYCAR,3du6hm,fleshwound_NPG,2,Mon Jul 20 01:03:34 2015 UTC,"I think Coletti's biggest problem is that he's a slow learner.  He's always had the talent to be quick on road courses but he doesn't adapt to changing conditions very well in a car he's not familiar with.  If you look at his first 2 seasons in GP2, he has some good runs but also a litter of really bad runs and his first two wins in his rookie season were from sprint races.  Coletti only really came into his stride in his 3rd and 4th season where he started to show up consistently at the front and I think his slowness to adapt is what turned F1 teams against him  I expected Coletti to be fighting for top 5s early and was disappointed to see that he still seemed a bit immature as a racer in IndyCar.  That said, I do think Coletti will be far better if he gets a second season and I wish him the best.  He's not a world beater but he'll definitely improve the talent pool of IndyCar unlike say, Gonzalez or Pippa Mann.  Keeping in mind he's beaten both Rafaele Marciello and Alexander Rossi in his last year in GP2."
INDYCAR,3du6hm,ThyLizardfolk,0,Mon Jul 20 00:15:25 2015 UTC,"At least coletti has shown signs if being fast, gabby chaves on the other hand has been a total disappointment."
INDYCAR,3du6hm,XSC,10,Sun Jul 19 15:20:36 2015 UTC,Goes against what Herta said. They want him back. I think he has been steady and consistent.   He'll probably win Rookie of the Year
INDYCAR,3du6hm,ThyLizardfolk,3,Sun Jul 19 15:27:34 2015 UTC,"I don't put too much stock into what Herta said.  He also said the team highly valued Luca Filippi and they ""coveted"" him.  Well... that didnt really turn out to be true as they snubbed Luca for Hawksworth and Chaves"
INDYCAR,3du6hm,MR_Rictus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:19:10 2015 UTC,Both of them brought money though.
INDYCAR,3du6hm,crashcarson15,2,Mon Jul 20 15:23:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think Chaves’s season has been… generally fine. He’s never been running with the front, but then again, I can only think of five Honda cars who genuinely have at any point this year — and RHR wasn’t really there until last night.  Getting the experience of turning laps and bringing home the car in one piece is a solid rookie season for him."
INDYCAR,3du6hm,Hoffgod,6,Mon Jul 20 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"Coletti has looked fast at times, but he's not consistent and he keeps getting into trouble. Coletti has a top finish of 8th and 4 DNFs. Chavez has a top finish of 9th and no DNFs. On top of that, Coletti has been involved in a bunch of collisions which didn't result in a DNF. Chavez hasn't. It's hard to overvalue a driver not getting into crashes, especially for a one car team like BHA."
INDYCAR,3du6hm,jameson2050,4,Sun Jul 19 17:35:40 2015 UTC,Why do you believe Chavez has been a total disappointment?  He has gained an average of 4 positions per race. That is second only to Graham Rahal (4.6 positions per race).  Chavez does have the worst average starting position of full-time drivers.  Poor qualifying from a rookie driver on a one-car team shouldn't be surprising. If I was a team owner or sponsor I would take note of Chavez' performance this year as a sign of future success.

INDYCAR,3drsoy,agravain,3,Sun Jul 19 03:11:13 2015 UTC,He does seem a little whiny lately doesn't he.  Damn veterans and these young kids and their aggressive driving
INDYCAR,3drsoy,no_comment_necessary,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:15:05 2015 UTC,I feel like it's because he's getting beaten by Newgarden in the same equipment. Always difficult to deal with. I found a couple moves that Sage made were OK and really just him running his line and taking the air off people because he was predicting their line. Not quite blocking but just smart oval racing
INDYCAR,3drsoy,atjays,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:36:27 2015 UTC,Oh stop the bitchering Ed you had no chance at a top 5.
INDYCAR,3drsoy,XSC,0,Sun Jul 19 03:10:59 2015 UTC,"I agree! Sage was straight up faster than him.   What would he be penalized for? Driving hard? It's not like Sage ever blocked him illegally or anything. Sage was straight up faster than him and it's the closing laps of a short track race... What is Sage supposed to do?   I honestly think that if Sage didn't get balked by the lapped cars on the restart he could have won. I didn't see his laptimes or anything, but he was closing in on Newgarden and RHR pretty damn quick"
INDYCAR,3drsoy,-internets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:31:35 2015 UTC,"Sage is an interesting character.   There are many drivers that were disliked because of their aggressive driving style. JPM and Michael Schumacher come to mind.  It did seem like he was being an asshole out there, but honestly if you were in his seat, what would you have done differently? I don't blame the kid honestly, but he's not making any friends out there.  Reminds me if a young Ryan Briscoe.  He does need to show a little more respect or one day, one of his moves is going to hurt somebody. I think that just comes with learning the craft. I'm not a fan of his, but I do respect his driving talent, and if he keeps it up, he's going to make a name for himself (good or bad)"
INDYCAR,3drsoy,no_comment_necessary,3,Sun Jul 19 06:10:11 2015 UTC,"He certainly is an interesting character.   I feel like people in this sub seem to have it out for him, which I don't really think is fair. He was basically the fastest car on track at the end of the race today, had a fair shot to win Fontana if it had gone green, and his been pretty fast all around.   In the first half of the season he was hampered by his broken wrist from a testing crash. I think his poor performance then is what got people against him initially. But now he's absolutely on a role, and is having one of the best rookies season of any driver I've seen in a very long time.  Could he have given Carpenter more room? Yeah of course! But did he deserve a penalty? No way. He was the fastest guy out there in the closing stages of a race.   If he didn't get balked by the lapped cars on the restart, he probably would have been mixing it up for the win.   Anyways, I don't think I've said anything new... Just basically repeated what you've already said. I think your assessment  of him is pretty spot on.   I want to add though that he's a young, super talented, brave, attractive American driver... Basically exactly the kind of driver people have been saying IndyCar needs for years! It just bums me out to see people getting the wrong impression of him. I think he could be a race winner before this season is over, and a future champion as well as 500 winner if he can secure a stable ride with a top team for years to come"
INDYCAR,3drsoy,-internets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:21:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think people have the wrong impression of him.  I think they have the exact impression of him.  Which is a cocky young talented superstar in the making.  For some reason, nobody likes that.  I'll admit, he's rubbed me the wrong way as well but if he keeps doing his thang, it's only going to make him more popular and bring more fans to the sport.  Wait..  I'm I kind of liking Sage Karam lol. Not until he retires and people are missing him being on the track"
INDYCAR,3drsoy,no_comment_necessary,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:31:44 2015 UTC,I guess you're right. A lot of ultra popular veteran drivers in almost all racing series have gone through a period where the fans really disliked them  (Fingers crossed Sage is one day a long time IndyCar veteran)
INDYCAR,3drsoy,-internets,4,Sun Jul 19 06:35:34 2015 UTC,Guess Rahal is a jerk too.  Sage is a problem. His driving and more so his attitude.
INDYCAR,3drsoy,MiniAndretti,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:31:46 2015 UTC,"Right??? Rahal made some way more aggressive moves than Sage did. Yeah Sage had some questionable ""blocking"" tactics but really Carpenter was overly optimistic and his passes weren't going to work anyways."
INDYCAR,3drsoy,atjays,2,Mon Jul 20 01:38:23 2015 UTC,"His driving is a real problem.  His attitude seemed ok when Ed was letting him have it, and in the post-race interview."

INDYCAR,3drsoy,dwhorton30,0,Sun Jul 19 06:16:09 2015 UTC,How did you get up votes for this? Dangerous to take his hand off the wheel? Really dude? You drive at 10 and 2? These guys are professional race car drivers. You've never driven a car with one hand lol
INDYCAR,3drsoy,no_comment_necessary,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:10:20 2015 UTC,"Sure I drive a car with one hand, at 70 or below on straight roads.   I'm not saying they aren't professionals, but close driving around bends at 180-190 seems like a bad time to do that if you can help it. And if he was so worried about sage being too close and out of control, he should have been ready on the wheel. Sage was still right there both times."
INDYCAR,3drsoy,dwhorton30,3,Sun Jul 19 06:18:36 2015 UTC,Sage was doing the one handed thing much earlier in the race as well though.
INDYCAR,3drsoy,dwhorton30,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:18:49 2015 UTC,And sage wasn't complaining about other people driving too dangerously. I wouldn't have said anything about the hands off the wheel if he didn't complain about how other drivers were racing after.

That disagreement gets people talking, and it gets people interested in watching what he does next. Compare that to Josef Newgarden. The only thing anyone says about Newgarden is ""He's a brilliant young driver and he'll be a superstar."" That's true, but it doesn't have the draw of a debate over whether someone is a madman or a genius. Indycar needs them both: the Josef Newgardens and the Sage Karams. If they both stick around in Indycar, the next few years should be very interesting."

INDYCAR,3drsoy,mulberryfu,6,Sun Jul 19 03:09:29 2015 UTC,I mean that's about as close to a televised fuck you as you're gonna get.
INDYCAR,3drsoy,PWGmark92,6,Sun Jul 19 03:04:26 2015 UTC,I was just about to say that his response to the whole thing was really good.

INDYCAR,3drsoy,treflechanceux,2,Sun Jul 19 03:03:12 2015 UTC,Did no one tell them we've moved on?  The energy output of ethanol when made with corn isn't cost effective in terms of its output.  IIRC the only country that can do it right is Brazil using sugar cane.
INDYCAR,3drsoy,KE0BVT,2,Sun Jul 19 03:04:04 2015 UTC,Maybe they should have used some of that power to make that first race happen this year.

INDYCAR,3drsoy,NoonecanknowMiner,10,Sun Jul 19 02:59:45 2015 UTC,Can't understands Ed being mad. Sage didn't hit him or anything. All I saw was an exceptionally talented young driver pushing to get every spot he could and getting everything out of his car. Nothing wrong with that.
INDYCAR,3drsoy,-internets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:35:45 2015 UTC,Yes! That's exactly right. Sage was straight up faster than Carpenter in the closing laps of a short track race... What was he supposed to do? Be content to ride around behind Ed? Hell no!  Sage closed pretty damn quick on Newgarden and RHR at the end too. I bet if he didn't get balked on the restart by the lap traffic he could have had a real shot to win

INDYCAR,3drsoy,Fielding_Mellish_FTW,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:03:27 2015 UTC,I tend to agree. From what I saw Karam was ahead but they were basically side by side. Sage was just trying to hold his position and his car was a little loose driving in disturbed air. It's debatable whether he was deliberately trying to force Ed up to the wall or not.
INDYCAR,3drsoy,World71Racer,6,Sun Jul 19 03:03:06 2015 UTC,"Great run for Josef Newgarden at the end there. If he would've had another 3-4 laps, that would've been a hell of a battle.  GW RHR!"

INDYCAR,3drsoy,Sallum,9,Sun Jul 19 02:59:38 2015 UTC,Carpenter had to pull or else Karam would have hit him. That should have been a penalty but Indycar doesn't do that anymore.
INDYCAR,3drsoy,neocamel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:58:40 2015 UTC,You get that on IRacing a lot. People win races because their more willing to crash than the other guy.
INDYCAR,3drsoy,-internets,2,Sun Jul 19 03:01:00 2015 UTC,"Why?   Double move blocking is what gets a penalty, not hard racing. Sage pulled a classic short track slide job. That's never been a penalty before in the 100+ years of open wheel racing"
INDYCAR,3drsoy,Sallum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:55:02 2015 UTC,The squeezing was fine in my opinion. But the overtake was not a slide job. The only reason Karam didn't have a date with the wall was because Carpenter pulled out. That could have easily been called for aggressive driving imo.
INDYCAR,3drsoy,Porsche_Curves,3,Sun Jul 19 05:39:37 2015 UTC,"Difference between racing and being a dick. If he was in a touring car, then yes, that's racing but he isn't in one so he's being a dick. Not hard to get a podium when you almost crash everyone out to get there."
INDYCAR,3drsoy,-internets,2,Sun Jul 19 15:30:59 2015 UTC,"So driving hard is being a dick? It's not like Sage was doing any danger double move blocking or anything, he was straight up faster than Ed and trying to get around him."

I am a huge fan of Sage. He is a great talent and has a lot of good qualities. But that was unacceptable, and out of line.

INDYCAR,3dstmp,mcman7890,3,Sun Jul 19 03:00:12 2015 UTC,"Check out our fun corn facts for kids. Learn interesting information about corn kernels, cobs and crops.   Corn is called maize by most countries, this comes from the Spanish word ‘maiz’. Corn is a cereal crop that is part of the grass family. An ear or cob of corn is actually part of the flower and an individual kernel is a seed. On average an ear of corn has 800 kernels in 16 rows. Corn will always have an even number of rows on each cob. A bushel is a unit of measure for volumes of dry commodities such as shelled corn kernels. 1 Bushel of corn is equal to 8 gallons. With the exception of Antarctica, corn is produced on every continent in the world. There are over 3,500 different uses for corn products. As well as being eaten by the cob, corn is also processed and used as a major component in many food items like cereals, peanut butter, potato chips, soups, marshmallows, ice cream, baby food, cooking oil, margarine, mayonnaise, salad dressing, and chewing gum. Juices and soft drinks like Coca-Cola and Pepsi contain corn sweeteners. A bushel of corn can sweeten 400 cans of soft drink. Corn and its by products are also found in many non-food items such as fireworks, rust preventatives, glue, paint, dyes, laundry detergent, soap, aspirin, antibiotics, paint, shoe polish, ink, cosmetics, the manufacturing of photographic film, and in the production of plastics. Corn is also used as feeding fodder for livestock and poultry and found in domestic pet food. As of 2012, the United States produces 40% of the worlds total harvest making it the biggest maize producer in the world (273,832,130 tonnes produced in 2012). An area termed the ""Corn Belt"" in the US where growing conditions are ideal includes the states of Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Michigan, Missouri, Kansas and Kentucky. In the days of the early settlers to North America corn was so valuable that it was used as money and traded for other products such as meat and furs. Corn is now a completely domesticated plant so you're unlikely to find it growing in the wild. Corn can be produced in various colors including blackish, bluish-gray, purple, green, red, white and the most common yellow."
INDYCAR,3dstmp,FancyAndImportantMan,4,Sun Jul 19 15:40:55 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, pretty solid race. I was really pulling for Newgarden but there's no question Hunter-Reay had the better car on the last run. Maybe a few more laps and it would have been more of a contest."
INDYCAR,3dstmp,FancyAndImportantMan,2,Sun Jul 19 15:42:09 2015 UTC,Fascinating
INDYCAR,3dstmp,no_comment_necessary,3,Sun Jul 19 19:34:55 2015 UTC,This race is always one of the best on the calendar. Amazing!!!
INDYCAR,3dstmp,Rdwomack2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:55:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that race was the best of the year besides the 500.   None of that pack racing, draft fest stuff. Just hard driving open wheel racing!"
INDYCAR,3dstmp,-internets,7,Sun Jul 19 05:59:33 2015 UTC,Fontana was an intense burst IndyCar needed. It just shows how well these world class drivers can handle these cars. Even Milwaukee was a good race.
INDYCAR,3dstmp,mreatsum,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:31:35 2015 UTC,"IndyCar needs one race every year like Fontana.  Just no more red flags to create green flag finishes, please."
INDYCAR,3dstmp,MiniAndretti,2,Sun Jul 19 14:40:18 2015 UTC,Alabama was right there too. Graham had been driving so good. If he could pull off this championship I don't know what I'll do.
INDYCAR,3dstmp,Mikemat5150,3,Sun Jul 19 14:35:19 2015 UTC,That would be absolutely incredible
INDYCAR,3dstmp,-internets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:15:00 2015 UTC,"It would be, but I think he's going to have to win another race and Montoya is going to have to have another bad day. Graham is 42 points behind which is almost a win.  If Montoya wins another race I think he's essentially got it in the bag.  Anything can happen though with the double points race.  Should make a very exciting end to the season"
INDYCAR,3dt42j,asdtech153,2,Sun Jul 19 04:56:28 2015 UTC,Nice place to visit. Bring your walking shoes and some bug spray. We've had way more rain than normal in Ohio and the mosquitoes are out of control. Not the best place to see a race but the atmosphere is very pleasant. It's like watching a race in a wooded park in some places.
INDYCAR,3dt42j,Weasel_DB,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:35:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, good advice. I live in Dayton, so ya, screw this rain. Is it better to stick to the grand stand? Or is it better to wander?"
INDYCAR,3dt42j,tomsjuan,2,Sun Jul 19 06:33:08 2015 UTC,"Wander, I've never been to Mid-Ohio for an IndyCar race, but I used to watch Grand Am there all the time (before the race was taken away cry)."
INDYCAR,3dt42j,slimnasty,2,Sun Jul 19 14:33:00 2015 UTC,"Bring some folding chairs and just move to a different spot from time to time. Wear really comfy shoes.   Infield observation mound by turn 4 is my Favorite. Right near concessions and opposite the grandstands.   It's worth going down by the keyhole too. You can really see the drivers working.   You can bring in food and drinks, unlike some other tracks. So load up your cooler."
INDYCAR,3dt42j,theground2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:04:58 2015 UTC,The best place to sit is on the hills at madness. The key hole would be a good place to watch some of the junior series races. The hill down at Thunder Valley is also nice.
INDYCAR,3dt42j,ThumperAC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"for picture taking I like the following spots:  inside T1 as they exit pit lane, inside Turn 4 and Turn 6.  All three of these spots have areas where you can shoot the cars without a fence in the way with normal access (i.e. not photo credentials needed).    Also a paddock pass is a must, the garages have a balcony where you can see the teams working on cars from above, this is a great spot to get pics of the cars up close and an angle unlike any other track I have been to.  Also, you have a good chance of running into most drives in the paddock."
INDYCAR,3dt42j,jbinhack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:01:16 2015 UTC,"Camping is really accommodating and fun - they put you right behind the keyhole and you can take your camping chairs up on the hill with your food and beer and watch racing all day. You can bring in cans or glass unlike at most tracks.  The track has so many awesome vantage points and I echo the sentiments of some earlier posts that recommend to check out the different areas of the track because it is a natural terrain roadcourse. You can rent a golfcart for $100 if it makes it easier to transport yourself, equipment and others quickly around the track.   Racing wise, the course provides a lot of great chances for quality photo-ops. The keyhole and Thunder Valley are really solid in my opinion.  And MidOhio provides some quality racing as well - last year Scott Dixon stole the show and one from last when it was looking like Josef Newgarden was gonna bring home a win.  You can tell a lot of fans have been coming to this track for awhile too - lots of pride and tradition at this racecourse."
INDYCAR,3drh2y,hiking_fool,3,Sat Jul 18 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"Love the grey sidewall. Anybody have the 411 on what the pros and cons of a softer compound in the wet would be, and how it might effect performance?"
INDYCAR,3drh2y,Rdwomack2,6,Sat Jul 18 19:38:56 2015 UTC,"A softer compound will give the tire better grip at lower temperatures and it'll also make up for some of the surface area lost by putting treads on the tire, but once the track dries out it's going to wear down way quicker."
INDYCAR,3drh2y,PegasusDeep,3,Sat Jul 18 20:11:48 2015 UTC,"is this replacing the current ""rain tire"" or is it similar to F1 where two different tires are available?"

I wish IndyCar had the ability to run road courses like F1 with a VSC procedure and full course yellows being extremely rare. Hopefully in the future they'll be able to upgrade their safety equipment to do that"

INDYCAR,3dqteq,Mikemat5150,3,Sat Jul 18 16:10:30 2015 UTC,Welcome!  I hope you enjoy your first IndyCar race.  Do you normally watch Formula1?  We're happy to answer any questions or hear any comments you have.    Typically someone will post a stream in the racethread comments.
INDYCAR,3dqteq,KE0BVT,4,Sat Jul 18 16:27:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do watch it usually and decided it's time I branch out a bit from watching just F1. There are some ex F1 drivers out in IndyCar so I figured it would be the best place to start.   Ah, so there are streams posted in the race threads? Cool, I'll drop by some time before the race then. Thanks a lot!"
INDYCAR,3dqteq,lzgr,5,Sat Jul 18 16:46:57 2015 UTC,"If you remember Sato from F1 a number of years ago, he's still in IndyCar and he's usually tremendously exciting to follow throughout the races"
INDYCAR,3dqteq,no_comment_necessary,3,Sat Jul 18 18:19:11 2015 UTC,"There will be streams posted in the race thread.    Don't know how much you know coming into this, so here's some background on what to expect. If you're used to F1, this race will be very different as it's on a short track oval. This means lapped traffic is going to be a major obstacle for the front runners. In past years, the cars have mostly been running single file in Iowa, with passing being a challenge. This year, thanks to the new aero kits, it's expected that the cars will be able to run in multiple lanes on the oval and passing will be easier. I doubt it'll be as intense as the Fontana race, but it should be fun. I hope you enjoy it."
INDYCAR,3dqteq,nascargo19,3,Sat Jul 18 18:01:52 2015 UTC,"I'll be looking for a stream too so we'll be in the same boat.  Indycar is great and you're in for a hell of a first race. Obviously it's an oval so it will be fairly different. Like Hoffgod said, it will be fairly single file but there was talk of them pulling at least 5gs through the corners the entire race. That's fairly close to 130R type forces an entire race.  Practice pace was around 180 so we'll see some fast laps around this little bullring. Let us know if you have any other questions."
INDYCAR,3dqteq,mreatsum,3,Sat Jul 18 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"I just posted a little bit ago that I'll be doing a two-hour prerace and one-hour postrace show tonight that you can hear online before the streams start.  I'll be going live at 5pm Central timeon Energy 106.7FM, which you can hear on MyIowaInfo.com.

INDYCAR,3drkxb,Backinthe70s,6,Sat Jul 18 23:57:23 2015 UTC,"Yes... For Now. Sports is the last place where TV definitely has online streaming beat as of now. I think Indycar coverage would be done far better on the internet than any television network could with the inherent constraints posed by television, but online sports time hasn't come yet. But I firmly believe that online sports is the final frontier to make cable as we know it irrelevant."
INDYCAR,3drkxb,mcmerctn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:34:54 2015 UTC,"I whole heartedly disagree. Sports streaming has TV beat by miles. Whether you pay for the legit services like MLB at bat, NFL Sunday ticket, or whatever it is, you have it. If you go into any game thread from soccer, hockey, NBA, NFL, cfb, collegebasketball, tennis, progolf, or other sports subs you will find a good quality stream. What's keeping cable in the hunt is all the TV shows on cable not being streamed live. They eventually are on there, but usually a day or two later. But sports are streamed live. Going back to the thread question, yes Indy Car needs to be on TV. NBCSN does a good job on their coverage, but if Indy Car could get on a network that's part of all providers basic cable package that would be ideal."
INDYCAR,3drkxb,mreatsum,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:22:26 2015 UTC,"It is only good when it piggybacks on a TV Network.  Imagine IndyCar trying to pull off streaming an entire race...  Yeah, that would end poorly."
INDYCAR,3drkxb,MiniAndretti,2,Sun Jul 19 19:05:23 2015 UTC,"The thing about that eSport tournament online, if it's the one I'm thinking of it's because the game developer heavily invests in their own. Something which IndyCar might have a hard time matching if they were to switch over."
INDYCAR,3drkxb,LKincheloe,2,Sat Jul 18 20:14:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of the main eSports tournaments are backed by the game's developers.  Like, for instance, Capcom runs the ""Capcom Cup,"" which is a series of tournaments for Super Street Fighter 4, and they add money into the prize pool.  IIRC a lot of tournaments don't do much on the streaming end, that's more on the streamers themselves.  For fighting game tournaments, the tournament organizers make out a stream schedule so to maximize exposure for all of the games across all of the streamers that may be there (Sp00ky, Bifuteki, etc).  All that said, IndyCar needs TV.  Pretty sure the second IndyCar loses TV, their sponsor base disappears to ARCA levels, if it's not already to that level already."
INDYCAR,3drkxb,michinoku1,2,Sat Jul 18 20:24:23 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't bother me much, and I am an older guy. The thing is, my ISP is my cable provider. So I would still have cable and internet, so I am more comfortable watching TV, on TV."

INDYCAR,3drkxb,ThumperAC,2,Sun Jul 19 01:43:37 2015 UTC,"I'm with the OP here. I don't have cable TV, and as much as I love racing, it's way too expensive for me to spend $100/mo. or $1,200/yr. just to watch Indy and F1. Also, I live in a place where I can't get good reception over the air, so it doesn't matter if it's on NBC/ABC/CBS. I'm waiting for the day when IndyCar will stream racing live, or at least offer on-demand viewing (preferably same day). Until then, I'm an IndyCar fan in hibernation mode, a demographic that is not served, and it's painful because the racing is especially good this year. How many of us are out there?"

INDYCAR,3drkxb,DAL1189,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:17:23 2015 UTC,"IndyCar fans skew older, especially compared to the audience of a video game tournament, so TV is definitely important for IndyCar. And there would be even fewer casual fans watching if IndyCar wasn't on TV."
INDYCAR,3dpjgl,-internets,2,Sat Jul 18 05:11:35 2015 UTC,I remember this!! man what a race! Indycar is top notch.
INDYCAR,3dpjgl,Rdwomack2,2,Sat Jul 18 05:25:49 2015 UTC,Has it been long enough to call this race a classic? Top notch is right!
INDYCAR,3dpjgl,Rdwomack2,6,Sat Jul 18 05:30:54 2015 UTC,Hey I consider barber this year as a classic race. I need to keep a list of races to show people. This is gonna be on that list.
INDYCAR,3dpjgl,Yoshiman400,3,Sat Jul 18 05:33:00 2015 UTC,Agreed on Barber. I'd even debate about calling Milwaukee a classic solely on the basis of Bourdais' brilliant dominance and crazy strategy to make it so.

INDYCAR,3dn670,schrack3000,8,Fri Jul 17 17:05:56 2015 UTC,If you sit up in turn 2 you can see a majority of the track. There's only 4 or 5 turns you won't be able to see from there which is pretty good for a road course. I've gone to a few SCCA events and the NASCAR race a few years ago and sat in turn 2 and loved it.
INDYCAR,3dn670,nickxoli,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:29:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! Went ahead and bought tickets for the upper section of turn 2. Looks like a great view from the pictures I've seen online. Thanks again.
INDYCAR,3dn670,itsreaditpeople,4,Sun Jul 19 15:33:20 2015 UTC,"I attended the NASCAR race this year at Sonoma and I had a fantastic time. I sat in section 9 which gives you a view Of nearly the entire track because the track is kind of built into a bowl shape. The staff at the track were really nice and really helpful and the facilities are really nice as well.   My only complaint is that there aren't any paved parking lots so you have to park your car up on a hill and it can be quite a hike to get back to your car but other than that it was one of the best experiences I've had attending a track live.   I just bought my ticket this morning for the Sonoma race in August. I can't speak to the quality of the indy racing there because this is my my first time with indy at this track, but the track itself is great."
INDYCAR,3dn670,-internets,3,Fri Jul 17 18:29:02 2015 UTC,I've never been but I had family go a few years ago and they said it was an excellent place to watch a race. I have no real advice other than get out there and experience it live!
INDYCAR,3dn670,iceman25c,3,Fri Jul 17 18:18:51 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend walking around. In my last trip to Sonoma, I watched about ten laps and then moved to a different area and watched ten laps and moved again. Since the grandstand wasn't full, I went there for the last five laps to see the finish. Each section seemed like a different track and there were open seats in every area. If you can, make sure to use the walkway over the track near turn one. Even if you can't see the cars through the banners, you can really feel them."
INDYCAR,3dn670,mcman7890,3,Fri Jul 17 19:41:52 2015 UTC,"I went last year, it was my first road course race. I stayed in turn 2 for the race, it was a great view. That and 7(?) what ever the hairpin on the back was, you could see alot too. Then down by the S's you could see a good chunk of the track. Ironicly, I didn't like the grandstand seating cant see much."
INDYCAR,3dn670,leaknoil,2,Fri Jul 17 19:57:44 2015 UTC,"Never watched Indycar there but, lots of other stuff over the years. It's probably going to be hot and dusty and there is no shade there. Bring lots of sun screen and water. Traffic in and out will suck bad. Not as bad as the NASCAR race but, getting in and out is usually the low points of the day. Most of the stands are pretty good. I don't like turn 2 but, some people do because of the possible wrecks as they come up the hill."
INDYCAR,3dn670,Mikemat5150,0,Fri Jul 17 18:45:34 2015 UTC,"I can't speak specifically about Sonoma but i grew up with road course racing so I can offer some input.   It's just different. You'll want to sit in a place that has a good breaking zone or a fast technical section. Depending on how many days you'll be there, I would pick a few spots to scope out for the race.   There are a good amount of support races too so I would get there early, walk around the place and enjoy. Drinking some beers and wandering to that awesome spot you stumble upon is great."
INDYCAR,3dm5sv,Mikemat5150,7,Fri Jul 17 11:46:39 2015 UTC,"Ford really wants to win on the 50th anniversary or the anniversary of their all-American win in 1967.  They will insist on the very best drivers in order to meet that goal.  I can't see Pruett and Hand losing their jobs so that's two positions already filled.  Kanaan is a good choice to fill a spot, at Fontana he sounded like he might be ready to get out of Indycar.  Of Chip's other drivers, Kyle Larson is excellent but young and with little to no sports car experience.  I can see him doing a stint at Road Atlanta but not LeMans.  Sage Karam should probably concentrate on Indycar in 2016.  Dixon is probably in for LeMans and another long race.  Allmendinger has an outside chance and is going nowhere in NASCAR.  I hope they leave McMurray on the sidelines.  Memo Rojas has experience driving for Chip, and since they need a European team I can see him doing that.  Dario's brother has also driven for Chip and would be a good fit in Europe.  Justin Wilson doesn't have a steady job and would be a good fit here too. Mad Max Papis is a bit old but can bring home the bacon.  And finally, I think they might be able to borrow Montoya for LeMans in 2017 if they don't get it done in 2016."
INDYCAR,3dm5sv,rushclay,2,Fri Jul 17 16:44:39 2015 UTC,Allmendinger would be nice. I'd also like to see him back in open wheel.   And I'd love to see Montoya go to Le Mans and get that last leg of the triple crown.
INDYCAR,3dm5sv,coach_wargo,2,Fri Jul 17 17:10:34 2015 UTC,"Montoya drives for Penske and Penske runs Fords in NASCAR.  I think he also has an appreciation for motorsports and a respect for Ganassi that would allow JPM to sneak out of the house and run LeMans.  But not unless they don't win in 2016.    I'd like to see JPM get the Triple Crown too, but what would really impress me is the Quad - Indy, LeMans, Daytona, Monaco.  I may never see it with the way driver contracts are written these days."
INDYCAR,3dm5sv,rushclay,3,Sat Jul 18 00:15:20 2015 UTC,Trackside has occasionally mentioned Kanaan as some who they could see moving over and doing an Indy 500 one off.   That would be a big seat to fill. Newgarden?
INDYCAR,3dm5sv,Yoshiman400,3,Fri Jul 17 11:47:50 2015 UTC,"Since we're talking about Ganassi, definitely. I'd love to see Ryan Briscoe take a ride like this full time if he can't get an IndyCar seat and if he isn't too tied up with Chevrolet in IMSA. I wonder if Dario could also try to nudge his brother into a ride."

So yeah, if he took a longtime IndyCar driver with him, that'd make sense too. I don't really see it being Dixie; he's too young. TK I could definitely see though. And what about Sage as another of the drivers? He's shown he's a great sports car driver."
INDYCAR,3dm5sv,coach_wargo,2,Fri Jul 17 14:54:45 2015 UTC,The article said they don't want young drivers. They want proven people who have been in huge races and handled the pressure well.

INDYCAR,3dm5sv,XSC,6,Fri Jul 17 13:50:25 2015 UTC,I would agree but I think Chevy is far too invested in their relationship with him to ever let that happen.
INDYCAR,3dmdem,Mikemat5150,6,Fri Jul 17 13:12:09 2015 UTC,"I'd be surprised if Rossi doesn't end up with a seat, despite what this article says. Haas has said he wants an American driver for his team and Rossi already has a FIA super license. No other American driver has a super license, and under the current, bizarre super license rules the only other American driver that could qualify for a super license is Ryan Hunter-Reay. No way RHR leaves Indycar to be a rookie in F1 at age 34. So if Haas wants an American driver, it's Rossi or nothing."
INDYCAR,3dmdem,Hoffgod,3,Fri Jul 17 14:00:59 2015 UTC,I imagine he'll be a reserve driver but with it being the first year they really need to develop the car.
INDYCAR,3dmdem,MiniAndretti,5,Fri Jul 17 14:17:46 2015 UTC,No veteran worth a shit will drive a car that will be at the back of the grid.

INDYCAR,3dmdem,jigielnik,2,Fri Jul 17 15:06:46 2015 UTC,The only thing she has going for her is that she is both small and super light weight.   And I guess her background in open wheel racing... But that's not really all that impressive
INDYCAR,3dmdem,SolopsismSux,5,Fri Jul 17 19:49:05 2015 UTC,"No idea why the super license rules are so fucked up... because I'd love to see Newgarden or Rahal go to F1...

INDYCAR,3dmdem,russlar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:32:45 2015 UTC,Maybe. He started a whole new Sprint Cup team without telling his co-owner just so he could have a car with HAAS on the hood.
INDYCAR,3dmdem,empw,3,Sat Jul 18 01:56:53 2015 UTC,I believe Kimi said that he is done with F1 if he isn't driving at Ferrari.   I'm guessing Jean Eric-Vergne and Gutierrez. Both reserve drivers for Ferrari and have driven recently. The wildcard could be Sutil since he has that sweet Capri Sun sponsorship.
INDYCAR,3dmdem,empw,2,Fri Jul 17 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing Jean Eric-Vergne and Gutierrez.   I think the fact that Rossi is already ruled out, despite being an American currently second in GP2, all but confirmed Gutierrez is one of Hass' drivers"

INDYCAR,3djzhv,Poached_Polyps,14,Fri Jul 17 02:36:11 2015 UTC,Just look at formula 1 if you want to see how good racing is with a large variety of cars...   /s
INDYCAR,3djzhv,Argyrius,5,Fri Jul 17 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"It's a bit unfair to compare Formula 1 racing to a series with only one chassis. Speaking as an F1 fan, Indycar is to me much more about balls to the wall racing, and you have many different drivers fighting for victory. This is in a large part possible because of the single chassis.  One of the beauties and defining features of F1 is that every team designs its own car, and that's one of the reasons that many are opposed to an eventual introduction of customer cars. A variety of cars may not make for consistently competitive racing like Indycar, but the 'design race' off-track is a very exciting feature (although I think that regulations currently are too limiting). Also, F1 may not have hugely exciting racing at the front, but throughout the grid the racing has still been very interesting this year."
INDYCAR,3djzhv,reddit-mandingo,2,Fri Jul 17 10:20:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  In F1 the designers and engineers are the real stars.  It's much more about the car than it is about the driver.  The driver matters, obviously, but seeing what the boffins can do with the car is a huge part of the series' draw."
INDYCAR,3djzhv,Poached_Polyps,2,Fri Jul 17 14:01:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's THAT unfair to compare them. They're the two biggest open wheel series I can think of and one of them has had  8 different winners in 12 races and the other has had 3 in 9 and that number isn't likely to go up at all the rest is of the season.    If you want to compare it to a series that also makes the chassis and engines take a look at WEC. They have found out how to have close competitive racing as a formula series and Indy has found out how to have close competitive racing as an open wheel series. For the better part of the last decade formula 1 hasn't been able to do that as either.    I love F1 too. I never miss a race and when it is exciting it is REALLY exciting! But when the best you can say is ""the battles for 10th place have been awesome!"" You know things are actually pretty boring. They need to do something (and I really don't know what that is - be it reduce dirty air, some sort of Max HP delta from the front to back, I don't know...) to actually make the racing exciting again."
INDYCAR,3djzhv,Argyrius,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:04:32 2015 UTC,"I said that it's a bit unfair because close competition on track has not been the main reason to watch F1 since like the 70s-80s. I for example, grew up during the Schumacher era, which was extremely 'boring'. On the other hand, for Indycar it is definitely the main reason to watch.   the other has had 3 in 9 and that number isn't likely to go up at all the rest is of the season   Which is not necessarily a bad thing. 1988 had 2 drivers taking every single victory of the season (edit: apart from one race) and yet the season is legendary. This season, Rosberg could take #1 in the championship in just one race.  I can't really speak for competition WEC, since the duration of the races makes it difficult for me to follow it enough to judge that, but I do think that in terms of freedom of design F1 can learn a lot from WEC.  F1 is not really about being consistently closely competitive, and IMO if that's what you're looking for then you're better off watching Indycar or GP2. Trying to make racing closer and encouraging overtaking has led to things that many fans (not me) consider to be gimmicks like DRS, and has taken away from us the spaceships that were the cars of 2008 (for better or worse)."
INDYCAR,3djzhv,DAL1189,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:34:07 2015 UTC,If you have 2 winners in a season or 3 like we did last year in F1 that isn't a bad thing. That small group of 2-3 drivers could be battling it out tooth and nail all season (much like what we saw last year.) Just because there is a limited number of winners doesn't mean that the racing isn't exciting or close. You can have mid field battles between 3 teams all fighting for that one place.
INDYCAR,3djzhv,fifty-two,2,Sun Jul 19 14:31:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not really convinced that Dallara is the best option for IndyCar.   For one thing, it seems like all of their cars have a tendency to launch into the air. Though in Dallara's defense, this could have more to do with the specs IndyCar is making them work to. But none-the-less, a problem.   But then you've also got safety concerns about the way Hinchcliffe was injured this year.  To quote Oriol Servia, “We used to have a connecting rod,” he said. “All that did was to avoid one of the two sides (of the wishbone) going in (the car). For 20 years we had that on all cars, and all of a sudden, this car, it wasn’t needed?""  And then we can get into more minor realms, such as the cars just aren't fast. They had to completely redesign the thing for Indy because the aero on it was a hot mess in 2012.   And finally, they've come out with pretty ugly looking stuff. You look at the other options the ICONIC committee had to choose from... including a gorgeous Lola chassis that would have been able to be used in both IndyCar and Indy Lights, making the ladder system that much better....  All-in-all, I'm not convinced that Dallara should be the supplier. They're less attentive-to-detail, more dangerous, slower, uglier... about the only thing they have going for them is that they built a big factory right across the street from IMS coincidentally around the time the ICONIC committee was making their decision...   Hmm..."
INDYCAR,3djzhv,TeamPlayers14,3,Fri Jul 17 05:55:35 2015 UTC,"Given Lola's history with the dominant chassis from approx 99-04ish (just woke up, not enough coffee yet to check dates), I think they know what works and what doesn't in Indycar.  That being said, didn't they go bankrupt?"

INDYCAR,3djzhv,Mikemat5150,3,Sat Jul 18 00:07:15 2015 UTC,"The problem is, who do you have besides Dallara. There is a reason they build cars for so many series around the world. Lola doesn't really exist anymore and Swift had been having financial troubles of their own."
INDYCAR,3djzhv,DAL1189,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:43:29 2015 UTC,"When you say all of the Dallara cars seem to have a tenancy to flip, can you give any examples? The recent flips we have seen this year, in my opinion at least, don't count as they seem to have been caused by the aero kits, not the DW 12 car. Also you think the Lola looks attractive? I think it looks terrible, especially the front wing"
INDYCAR,3djzhv,Mikemat5150,2,Sun Jul 19 14:26:46 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'm fairly certain it is something similar to what they have now. Dallara produces the basic chassis and someone else builds the body work. Essentially, the same thing that DTM and V8 Supercars does."

I think we've see something new between 2019-2022. We will understand a lot more about aero-kits and be able to decide which way to go with them.
INDYCAR,3djzhv,WhateverJoel,0,Sat Jul 18 17:46:40 2015 UTC,What the series badly needs to do is move away from the single chassis and lease engine crap. You want to see more than 34 cars show up at Indy? That's the only way it's going to happen.  I know it's expensive at first BUT after the first year or two you'll see people start racing the used chassis other teams drop.
INDYCAR,3djzhv,furiousjorgey,0,Fri Jul 17 05:03:34 2015 UTC,"I think the original idea was 5 years, which puts this one through the 2017 season, so a new one in 2018. Hopefully they get a model picked and can start running test mules soon so we don't have any ugly surprises."

INDYCAR,3didba,Mikemat5150,12,Thu Jul 16 14:49:07 2015 UTC,I've been very happy with NBCSN.  As a motocross racer I was a little bummed it didn't get any mentioning in the article. Both supercross and the nationals were on Speed and now the Nationals are on NBCSN and Supercross is on FS1.
INDYCAR,3didba,Lone_Star_122,11,Thu Jul 16 18:55:08 2015 UTC,"As a cord cutter, it doesn't matter to me which networks the races are on. I just want to see more races streamed on the Internet."
INDYCAR,3didba,emperortomatocatsup,2,Fri Jul 17 02:39:10 2015 UTC,I am the same. I completely understand the emphasis on TV and am so glad that Indycar got back to streaming their practice and qualifying sessions

However, NBCSN SUCKS ASS. The commercials fill at least 50% of the program time. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN ANY WAY!!! Watching the race and missing the whole race at the same time really sucks.  Also, Le Mans coverage this year was the worst in memory. Literally like 2 hours of coverage was available on the TV, and then it was 40% commercials.   There's a reason everybody is going digital... because watching motorsports on cable is nearly impossible at this point."
INDYCAR,3didba,Durexman,21,Thu Jul 16 15:14:52 2015 UTC,"Fox has far more commercials than NBC. By a lot. I think people complain way to much about them, they fail to realize that indycar is drawing less than a 1.0 rating. There aren't a lot of people watching so they have to sell more ads. Now there is a greed factor and I think it affects NASCAR more because they generally have decent ratings and still have too many y commercials"

INDYCAR,3didba,lrsmithwhaley,2,Thu Jul 16 19:37:59 2015 UTC,The sad thing is many NASCAR fans prefer NBCSPORTS over FS because they are much better.

INDYCAR,3dhnaq,JohnOO,6,Thu Jul 16 10:15:02 2015 UTC,It was bouncing over grass and was pretty intertwined with RHR's so air is going to get under the chassis.   If it had been concrete he definitely wouldn't have flipped with the nose digging into the ground.
INDYCAR,3dhnaq,Mikemat5150,2,Thu Jul 16 10:51:20 2015 UTC,I thought the issue at Indy was the air getting under the car and lifting it?
INDYCAR,3dhnaq,Mikemat5150,4,Thu Jul 16 10:53:53 2015 UTC,It was. Those cars flipped on their own with help from a wall. Briscoe's crash had a whole number of things happen to it.
INDYCAR,3dhnaq,White-and-Nerdy,2,Thu Jul 16 10:56:29 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion was that the chevys were flipping due to sort of a wedge in the tire guards (would include a photo if i wasn't at work), that lifts it, under wing catches it its all over. Don't see Honda having that problem."
INDYCAR,3dhnaq,drogyn1701,2,Thu Jul 16 12:15:20 2015 UTC,Haven't they made changes to the aero kits post-Indy to try and stop that from happening?

INDYCAR,3dhnaq,Yoshiman400,3,Thu Jul 16 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"Just broke loose off of 2, either driver error or perhaps a gust of wind. Also don't forget that they tried not showing too many replays of the accident out of respect for Moore."
INDYCAR,3dhnaq,-internets,3,Thu Jul 16 17:53:23 2015 UTC,"He got loose off of turn 2 and I think rather than initially locking up the brakes, he stayed hard on the gas trying to power out of the spin and save the car.

INDYCAR,3dfcdx,Cross-Country,3,Thu Jul 16 21:00:29 2015 UTC,"I think the general attitude (and definitely my attitude on the subject) is that while IndyCar has focused on improving its product in the wake of the Dan Wheldon crash at Vegas, NASCAR has had a deep and consistent decline in quality since 2007. I loved NASCAR for years, I grew up watching it and never missed a race for years if I could help it. Now it's been destroyed by a ridiculous post-season system, a shitty car, and team-based racing that renders all but 5 drivers per race non-competitive. I want to see the whole field race, not just block for their teammates. NASCAR drivers used to race to win (which garnered them points), now they just race for consistency to get points."

No money in running a few late-season races with a non-Leader's Circle entrant with so few points and virtually no race purse to earn to help pay the bills.  Now the #25 has run several races, has a chunk of points and could sneak into the 2016 Leader's Circle money by years end with those points earned by Simona/Justin (as Mikemat5150 said), plus with Honda footing some of the bill, and one of the most respected race-winning veterans giving good feedback, why not?"

The broadcast team sucks, it's confusing to casual fans for broadcasts to jump from network to network, and ESPN offers no cross promotion with other forms of motorsports. It's much easier to get fans of one form of racing to watch another than it is to get someone who never watches racing to tune in for the first time. NBC can cross promote their F1, NASCAR, and Indy coverage and grow all three audiences."
INDYCAR,3dclb5,coach_wargo,3,Wed Jul 15 14:04:06 2015 UTC,They didn't do any Indycar promotion before and I doubt this will be the kicker. They'll probably do even less. I wish we could have races on NBC to get rid of that ABC crew.

ESPN is known to promote the sports properties that they have contracts with more heavily on shows like Sports Center. With NASCAR and NHRA out of the mix, ESPN may devote more of its resources to promoting the lone motorsports property that they still have a contract with - that being INDYCAR. If I was a conspiracy theorist, I'd say that ESPN officials have known for the past few weeks that the NHRA partnership was ending, which is why we've seen highlights from the last few INDYCAR races on Sports Center.   /PieInTheSky"

INDYCAR,3dclb5,MiniAndretti,2,Wed Jul 15 12:05:04 2015 UTC,"What Indycar needs is a TV partner willing to show many more races on network tv. Right now ABC/ESPN has a skeleton crew covering the race because it is all bout cashing in on the 500 audience but they currently have zero interest in the rest of the season. yes I'm aware they have some races other than the 500 but it is all about build up to maximizing the 500 audience and cashing in on the post-500 audience with the detroit races. That leaves the races currently on NBCSN being viewed by just the sport die-hard viewers. If Indycar is to survive, it needs happy sponsors and what gets happy sponsors is higher ratings. Indycar NEEDS more than 3 weekends a year on network to tv to draw in the casual viewing audience. As great as a broadcast as NBCSN has put together, it hasn't drawn in eyeballs because it is a network that your casual viewer still isn't aware they have or thinks to stop there when channel surfing. If Indycar is to remain with NBC, they need to get more races on NBC not NBCSN once the current deal expires. The next best solution is to do a full season deal with ABC/ESPN because ESPN is the default channel for anyone wanting to watch sports. A race on ESPN will pick up many more casual viewers than a race on NBCSN. A full season deal with ESPN may cause them to up their production quality...at least one can hope."
INDYCAR,3dclb5,cajunaggie08,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:03:09 2015 UTC,F1 US ratings are growing rapidly despite having only 4 races on network tv.
INDYCAR,3dclb5,ctnaka,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:22:54 2015 UTC,"F1 has the luxury of being perceived as the ""premier"" racing league of the world. As much as I love INDYCAR, it is lucky to even be perceived as a league right now by the american audience."
INDYCAR,3dclb5,cajunaggie08,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:33:43 2015 UTC,"True F1 has more recognition.  But it had been stagnant in the US for a long time, until just recently.  I give NBCSN a lot of credit for that.  They have grown their network primarily on the back of the NHL, but they have done a good job using that increase in viewers and promoting F1 and it has shown.  If they had the 500 I think it would make a huge difference in how far they could push indy"
INDYCAR,3dclb5,ctnaka,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:50:37 2015 UTC,"Oh i very much agree. Assuming NBC is still interested in INDYCAR after 2018, it would give a huge bump to their NBCSN  indycar race ratings to have the 500 and some other races on NBC to piggy back off of. i haven't watched a nascar race on NBC yet, but I'd be curious if they did some promotion for their indycar races during the nascar race. I feel NASCAR coming to the NBC group should help INDYCAR in the short term as it will help promote INDYCAR to people who already enjoy watching races"
INDYCAR,3dclb5,cajunaggie08,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:07:33 2015 UTC,I don't follow other sports.  What does NBC have going on during the Summer that would prevent them from showing the races on broadcast tv?  Is it simply the prior ABC agreements that prevent another network from moving their coverage to network?  At some point ABC has to realize that they'll be able to get more for Indy 500 commercials if they let NBC promote the series better.
INDYCAR,3dclb5,rushclay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:14:53 2015 UTC,The current ABC contract states that they will be the exclusive broadcast home of INDYCAR. That contract runs through 2018.
INDYCAR,3dclb5,cajunaggie08,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:03:09 2015 UTC,"2018 is too late.  I'm afraid it's time for the ABC remote truck to have a little ""accident""."
INDYCAR,3dclb5,rushclay,2,Thu Jul 16 22:35:00 2015 UTC,And yet they will still give indycar the shaft.
INDYCAR,3da9n2,INeedANamePlz,9,Tue Jul 14 18:43:43 2015 UTC,"I knew he was having a better season, but I was surprised when I looked at the standings before Milwaukee and he was within that magical 100-point mark. So he's a distant contender, but distant partly because Montoya's been so good."
INDYCAR,3da9n2,jlh2b,7,Tue Jul 14 19:39:48 2015 UTC,"Since the dw12 he has been very consistent, if he gets on a rahal tear streak (he has shown signs of improvement) he can be a contender easily."
INDYCAR,3da9n2,XSC,3,Tue Jul 14 19:48:35 2015 UTC,"And if he'd grab a win, especially at Sonoma, he'd finish very close."
INDYCAR,3da9n2,mswizzle83,7,Tue Jul 14 19:54:24 2015 UTC,Iowa could be where he really starts to gain momentum. I'd love to see him win this weekend!
INDYCAR,3da9n2,-internets,4,Tue Jul 14 20:12:00 2015 UTC,Four podiums in eight races at Iowa. He has a great shot to close the gap there.
INDYCAR,3da9n2,XSC,3,Tue Jul 14 21:04:58 2015 UTC,"Or pocono, he's fast there! Marco really has a shot here but I think rahal is more likely."
INDYCAR,3da9n2,-internets,2,Tue Jul 14 20:18:05 2015 UTC,Oh yeah definitely
INDYCAR,3da9n2,no_comment_necessary,3,Tue Jul 14 20:26:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot can happen with a double points race still to come."
INDYCAR,3da9n2,Yoshiman400,2,Tue Jul 14 20:56:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I'm so excited for Rahal.  He's only 15 points behind Dixon but with the double points, he actually has a decent shot at catching Juan (granted he gets a good finish and Juan has a bad day)"
INDYCAR,3da9n2,coach_wargo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:44:37 2015 UTC,"I wish the double points race was Pocono instead of Sonoma, but the way Rahal has been all season long, and with Marco's consistency lately, this championship is not as easy for Montoya to win as it'd all seem. *coughPower20112012cough*  One of us ought to figure out what these standings would look like at the end of the season had double points been given to the Triple Crown events as opposed to Indy and Sonoma."
INDYCAR,3da9n2,MUYkylo,5,Wed Jul 15 12:57:32 2015 UTC,"A story like this is the kiss of death, expect a retirement in Iowa."

It's always bothered me, as well as Moore, and Dan W. That sick feeling that comes over you as you( and the announcers) realize this is bad, real bad."

INDYCAR,3d9nt7,XSC,4,Tue Jul 14 16:37:28 2015 UTC,He is. I believe he was in an open wheel car a few weeks ago so he is driving whatever he can get his hands on!
INDYCAR,3d9nt7,lennysundahl,6,Tue Jul 14 17:05:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's also running the full season in GRC's Lites division with the team that's won the last two titles--has two wins in four races, currently second in points. Earlier this year he was in a Mercedes SLS at the Bathurst 12 Hours. The kid is driving EVERYTHING."
INDYCAR,3d9nt7,INeedANamePlz,4,Tue Jul 14 17:55:31 2015 UTC,He just grabbed the first victory for the new Ford Shelby GT350R-C at Mosport a few days ago in the Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge too.

INDYCAR,3d9ai7,XSC,7,Tue Jul 14 15:40:28 2015 UTC,Andretti is doing his share. The city really needs to step up their game. We as fans can also help by spreading the word and encouraging new fans.
INDYCAR,3d9ai7,Rdwomack2,3,Tue Jul 14 16:02:40 2015 UTC,"I think this is the big one. Indycar fans need to be more vocal about this series. Things are getting better though, you only have to look at the difference in activity here between 2012 and 2015. Slowly but surely, Indycars are starting to win the skeptics over."
INDYCAR,3d9ai7,SensationalDuke,2,Tue Jul 14 16:41:39 2015 UTC,If I hadn't actually heard the cars running I wouldn't have known there was a race this weekend.  obviously outside of being a fan that already follows the sport

INDYCAR,3d9ai7,Rdwomack2,3,Tue Jul 14 19:41:21 2015 UTC,"IndyCars lack of popularity and attendance is not the fault of its fans unless we just choose not to buy tickets.  The tracks need to market these races through all forms of media: social, bill board, print, and radio."

My Dad hasn't missed Indy since 1972 (and me since 1999), and after going to Milwaukee for the first time last year he said if he were in a position where he had to choose one, he would go to Milwaukee. It's a shame it seems to be falling by the wayside."

If ratings go up to the 1s eventually it will be very good news for indycar. Sponsors will see more value for the money, specially when nascar is scoring 2.0s.

INDYCAR,3d5o23,Rdwomack2,9,Mon Jul 13 19:38:20 2015 UTC,It could be a part of it. There was a surprisingly good amount of promotion for IndyCar during NBCSN's broadcast Saturday night.

INDYCAR,3d628m,mojojojoborras,13,Tue Jul 14 00:44:59 2015 UTC,"I think if CART were still around, running AOWR, then the series would be seen as more of a world Championship, based on American values.  I think it would have still declined some naturally in the US, but it had a strong and rowing global following.  I think there'd be no problems making a 25 race schedule for CART in 2016. I think more of the world's top drivers would be here. I think, with more notoriety comes more money. And with more money comes more talent. Will Power would still be here battling for a title with Juan Montoya, but you'd probably also have some of the NASCAR guys having gone this route instead. And a few F1 drivers with talent would be here.   Reynard maybe would still be alive? Lola would be here. Panoz would be here. Swift would be here. Dallara would probably be here, but uncompetitive. Toyota maybe would have never left. Ford, Honda, Chevy, Mercedes would still be here.   But that's just my opinion and a bit of wishing.  I kind of whore this out a lot, but in rFactor, a racing sim game, I like to set myself up in this parallel universe where CART never folded and the split never happened. Here's what the 2014 field could have looked like in CART-esque cars: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ4wGcAWBVc"
INDYCAR,3d628m,fifty-two,5,Mon Jul 13 21:01:33 2015 UTC,"In the early and mid 90s people were talking about CART challenging F1 and we were starting to poach drivers away from F1. However, given the economic downturn and less starting money in CART and the emergence of middle-eastern oil money to F1, I think CART would be a step behind F1 even in 2015, though it may well be a relatively small step.  The interesting questions are how it would be competing with NASCAR and WEC. I think that given the open-wheel origins of some key NASCAR figures and the state of CART before the split, it would be on absolutely even footing if not slightly ahead of NASCAR domestically, and it would be an equal-or-slightly-ahead destination for the recent influx of driving talent and manufacturer attention to the WEC. In other words, I think it would be at least as big as NASCAR and WEC, and it would have a very realistic chance of being bigger than those and just behind F1.   Additionally, I think a healthier CART would have actually hurt North American sportscars in the ALMS and Tudor.   As things stand, I think we are absolute best case 15 years from where we were before the split. Tony George set back American open-wheel racing at least 30 years to take his xenophobic egotistic ball and go home."
INDYCAR,3d628m,chirstopher0us,2,Mon Jul 13 23:20:14 2015 UTC,Maybe- but by the time the mideast money came into play CART/IRL were well and truly f***ed.
INDYCAR,3d628m,mojojojoborras,8,Tue Jul 14 00:46:00 2015 UTC,"I'm over from the r/nascar page but we'd probably see guys like Jeff Gordon and Tony Stewart in CART open wheel racing right now. Gordon's racing dream was originally open wheel racing but decided to go the stock car route since 1) CART and IRL were in uneasy places and 2) NASCAR was on a huge upswing in popularity. Stewart, who drove the hell out of everything he drives, was in IRL in 96-97 or so and won the championship in 1997 so I wouldn't be surprised if he were still there without the split going down."
INDYCAR,3d628m,tha_undaground,5,Mon Jul 13 21:56:48 2015 UTC,"I do wonder if Menard would have still brought Stewart to indy without a split. I'd think yes, but Menard would have still been part-time/non-competive outside of Indianapolis. Stewart would have still ended up in Nascar."
INDYCAR,3d628m,captmrwill,3,Tue Jul 14 03:18:43 2015 UTC,"this is not the reason Gordon, nor Stewart chose NASCAR over CART/IRL. Gordon didn't chose, Gordon's problem was he didn't bring money in. He tested for several big name teams in the early 90's, but they all wanted him to bring sponsorship.   In fact, one could deduce that losing the talent in USAC to NASCAR was a major driving force for the split in the first place. Stewart still stuck with doing IRL, but there was absolutely no money in IRL at the time. Stewart also came around after the split, which happened in 1994."
INDYCAR,3d628m,synoptic_cyclone,5,Tue Jul 14 21:12:59 2015 UTC,"From my understanding... (which is quite recent, I was a kid during the CART days).  Losing the Indy 500 was a big hit in advertising, being such a big name was an advertising blow, specially in the casual market.  There were problems with cost control, engine manufacturers were losing money over engine development, and CART failed to manage that, which prompted Honda and Toyota to move to IRL, Mercedes to drop entirely and left Ford alone, which in reality was Cosworth.   The Texas speedway scandal also hurt CART's finances, specially when IRL raced there succesfully.   I think that the ban in tobacco advertising also had a negative effect in CART.  In the end, I think CART ended being bigger outside USA than inside, I remember a lot of Mexican advertising and sponsorships (like Jourdain's Gigante car) during the early 2000s, but that came too late.  Even without the split, CART would have faced some very important challenges, specially regarding money, the development costs of those 2.4 L V8 Turbo were too high, and road relevance was 0, so those engines ended up being pure advertising to manufacturers which hardly could apply that technology to their main products (road cars). I think CART would have ended up pretty much in the same position where IndyCar is now, Indy 500 is the biggest name, while pretty much many of the car components are standarized for cost control measures, but I think the brand would be in a better position against NASCAR in terms about ratings and attendance. Many casual fans were turned off from open wheel racing due to the confusion of having two championships."
INDYCAR,3d628m,alexmex90,8,Mon Jul 13 21:25:26 2015 UTC,The effect of the advertising ban with tobacco on Motorsport cannot be overstated.
INDYCAR,3d628m,MiniAndretti,3,Tue Jul 14 01:51:11 2015 UTC,"Yup, free Marlboro tickets kept many, many ovals afloat up till the late 00s"
INDYCAR,3d628m,captmrwill,2,Tue Jul 14 03:21:07 2015 UTC,And the teams. Go look at pictures of race cars as far back as the 1960's. Tobacco sponsors everywhere.
INDYCAR,3d628m,MiniAndretti,2,Tue Jul 14 12:27:26 2015 UTC,"Losing tobacco sponsorship meant a significant loss, in all forms of motorsport."
INDYCAR,3d628m,alexmex90,4,Tue Jul 14 18:09:37 2015 UTC,"There are many possible outcomes.   1 it continues how it was in the 90s and becomes an even rival to f1 Making drivers decide which of thetwo formulas they will end up. Major many would had joined which would had resulted in more international events. It would probably be more international than American but it would still have major events in america. Ovals would probably be a minority but the schedule would easily be 25 events.   2 Management would drive it to the ground, owners would had have enough and a split would eventually happen, we would still be watching a split series.   3 The series has some major success but never really passes f1,it would be competing with nascar but obviously on a downfall.  Honestly I think things would not be that good if it didn't happen, indycar historically has had mediocre management."
INDYCAR,3d628m,XSC,7,Mon Jul 13 22:44:28 2015 UTC,"IndyCar would be much bigger had the split not happened.  CART was still a big deal in 1995 & 1996 (the first years of the split), and in the years thereafter, but CART made a big mistake in 1998 by holding an IPO and going public.  CART had the teams, the sponsors, the money, and the big races, bar the Indy 500.  The IRL had AJ Foyt's team and an all oval schedule that was very much ""grassroots"" styled - smaller teams, less money, less technology in the cars.  Most of all, the formulas were different between the two, with CART running turbochargers, and the IRL stock block engines.  Indeed, the IRL ""won"" the war because of the 500.  Sponsors of CART teams wanted to be at the 500, but CART was still big in the late 90's, with enough money and TV ratings to keep them in the series.  That didn't last, though, and the 2002 season was really the turning point, with teams and engine manufacturers jumping to the IRL.  With CART having gone public in 98', their stock price tanked, and they ended up bankrupt.  Had Paul Gentilozzi and Kevin Kalkhoven not stepped in to buy what remained, CART/Champ Car would've died out right then and there, and a lot of races, like Toronto and Long Beach, probably wouldn't around anymore, since the IRL was running an oval only schedule still.  Going back to your original question, however, IndyCar would be in a much better place.  I'm sure CART wouldn't have gone public, since that seemed driven by a need to keep sponsors in the series.  NASCAR, in 95' and 96', was still a growing entity, but a lot of their races were on channels like how IndyCar is now - lower tiered channels like TNN and ESPN2, while CART was on ABC, with a handful of races on ESPN.  Eventually the whole deal switched - CART moved to smaller channels, while NASCAR got the national TV deals, and eventually landed on FOX.  TL;dr - IMO, IndyCar would probably still be a revered, top-tier, worldwide series, had the split not happened.  Changes would've needed to be made as the years moved on, obviously, but before and in the early years of the split, open wheel racing was still very popular."
INDYCAR,3d628m,michinoku1,2,Mon Jul 13 21:12:45 2015 UTC,The IRL was ready to scoop up Long Beach when ChampCar was on life support.  That race was never going to die.
INDYCAR,3d628m,MiniAndretti,2,Tue Jul 14 01:53:16 2015 UTC,"And they also had Surfers Paradise on hand and could have easily kept it going had the deal been a bit more cooperative. The reason it was a nonpoints event in 2008 was because Chicagoland already agreed to be the official season finale. IIRC, after 2008 the conflict became SP wanting to be the season finale vs. IndyCar wanting an oval to be the season finale."
INDYCAR,3d628m,Yoshiman400,3,Wed Jul 15 18:36:16 2015 UTC,The real alternate reality is where would the sport be if tobacco advertisement had not been banned? That sucked about 60% of the money out of all motorsport.
INDYCAR,3d628m,SillyPseudonym,2,Tue Jul 14 21:17:51 2015 UTC,NASCAR got on fine without it as did F1.
INDYCAR,3d628m,leaknoil,3,Wed Jul 15 02:01:57 2015 UTC,Nascar literally lost their title sponsor and then started altering the points system to draw more interest and money. F1 is on life support because non-works teams no longer have easy sponsor dollars and we now have an army of pay drivers in every entry-level seat.  It's the biggest loss of revenue in the history of the sport dude. Across all disciplines.
INDYCAR,3d628m,SillyPseudonym,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:23:19 2015 UTC,"Teams are spending record sums today to race. It hasn't effected the top teams at all. Sure it may have been easy money but, it wouldn't change the outcome. The top sponsors want to be on the top cars. They just have to work a little harder for it and they have. It also has little effect on the dropping attendance and viewership numbers especially in the US. NASCAR is not as popular as it once was no matter what logo is on the car. Motorsports in general have lost popularity in the US."
INDYCAR,3d628m,leaknoil,3,Wed Jul 15 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"I mined each reply for the various responses here, just didn't take the time to quote them.  I'm not picking on anyone here.  If The Split (TM) had never happened:  IndyCar would still have declined partially because of the country's cultural shift against foreign countries as a result of certain historical and political events and the loss of tobacco sponsorship.  The schedule would still top out at around 20 races.  25 would not be viable.  Lola and Reynard would probably be the two dominant chassis.  Swift might be around, Panoz would have never entered because they only entered at the behest of Champ Car, not CART and Dallara would never have entered because the series likely never would have gone to a spec chassis.  There's also the possibility if Lola or Reynard became dominant, the series would have become a de-facto spec series with everyone running the dominant chassis.  Gordon was always headed for NASCAR, regardless of what anyone tells you.  Stewart would probably be a IndyCar champion by now.  He would have impressed enough with Menard to get a full-time ride.  There's also a real possibility the CART board of directors would have run the series into the ground anyway.  Between angering Honda and Toyota, both of them leaving were a very real possibility.  The board was constantly at odds with each other while trying to pursue their own self-interests.  CART may have been successful but it was by far not in the best state.  I don't think this is relevant to this conversation but think it's interesting to note, without The Split, the CART IPO likely never would have happened either.  A non-split IndyCar Series definitely would have hurt North American sportscar racing.  Anyone remember how anemic IMSA was after the GTP era until the ALMS came into it's own in the late 90s?  It was mentioned once or twice in this thread but you could argue the loss of tobacco advertising hurt the sport more than anything.  If tobacco money was still coursing through the sport, CART may have been able to outlast the IRL to begin with.  However, you could also say if tobacco advertising wasn't at risk, could Phillip Morris, Players, and other companies put pressure on the sanctioning bodies and tracks to get through the dispute in peace?  I love threads like this centered around discussion of actual events and facts that changed the course of the sport, for good or bad, instead of the insanity you find on Crapwagon and TrackForum."
INDYCAR,3d628m,6157,3,Tue Jul 14 23:11:54 2015 UTC,"The Split was a very deep, multi-dimensional event that's very difficult to hypothetically reverse.  CART was going through similar issues that plague F1 presently: costs were spiraling out of control, there were insurmountable gaps between teams with money and teams without, drivers were often determined by how much money they could offer instead of skill, and the schedule was moving away from traditional circuits and into international markets (to the ire of American fans).  NASCAR was also marketing heavily at the time, and it's rise in popularity would have happened anyways. CART was on the path of being in NASCAR's shadow domestically and F1's shadow internationally, and given the extremely high cost of entry, the series would be on pretty shaky ground past the 90's.   Had The Split not happened, I still think the only thing that would have kept CART alive was the Indy 500. Roger Penske saw the writing on the wall and bailed. He was previously a huge stakeholder of CART, but in 2002 Penske brought the series to market, sold his shares, dumped the series for IRL, and CART collapsed into bankruptcy.    Had none of that happened, I still think CART would have had to address it's cost and competitive issues, and I'd like to think they would have ended up with the same formula we have now: a single chassis with multiple engine/aero manufacturers.  Maybe we'd have 3 or 4 manufacturers instead of 2, we'd probably still have tracks like Surfer's Paradise, Cleveland, Road America, Michigan, Phoenix, and Laguna Seca on the schedule, and TV viewership would probably be a little higher then it is now. But otherwise, I don't think a lot would be different from what we have today."
INDYCAR,3d628m,malowolf,7,Wed Jul 15 20:34:15 2015 UTC,"I feel that the split started in 1978-79 and doubt that USAC would have been any better or different from what we wound up with. CART went bankrupt twice and clearly had financial troubles before the IRL was formed, so I really don't think things would be better if CART had ""won"" the split either. All in all I would prefer that fans look to the future instead of picking at old wounds."
INDYCAR,3d628m,ianindy,3,Mon Jul 13 20:57:02 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent point, there's really been two splits in U.S. open wheel racing.

INDYCAR,3d628m,korko,2,Tue Jul 14 01:06:33 2015 UTC,The Hulmann-George diehards like to put forth a narrative that CART's failure to exist without the 500 proves CART would have failed with the 500. No one whose head isn't up their ass really agrees with it though.
INDYCAR,3d628m,SillyPseudonym,2,Tue Jul 14 13:34:41 2015 UTC,"The 500 is the money. I am actually surprised it has held it's value in the US. It obviously isn't what it once was but, it gets play. David Letterman probably has a little to do with it though."
INDYCAR,3d628m,leaknoil,2,Wed Jul 15 02:11:29 2015 UTC,"I imagine CART would be international, and would still have oval and road course races. Many of the drivers in IndyCar right now would be in CART. Multiple retired F1 drivers would be in CART, like Barrichello, Webber, Kubica, and Heidfeld. Maybe even Schumacher briefly. Allmendinger would still be in CART, and not NASCAR. CART would be massive, about as big as F1."
INDYCAR,3d628m,NoonecanknowMiner,2,Wed Jul 15 14:25:41 2015 UTC,"Many good points in other responses, but I wanted to explore how the split might have impacted the careers of the two top drivers of the mid-1990s, and consequently, the rest of the grid.  In 1995, Al Unser Jr. and Michael Andretti were arguably at their peak (they were both around 33 years old) and were the two household names still racing. Unfortunately the split happened and both of them missed the Indy 500 for several crucial years of their careers. I speculate that the loss of the Indy 500 from their schedules had a serious impact to both of their motivations to race, and contributed to their retirement/decline in the early 2000s.   Here's what I think might've happened if Indycar racing had not split. Unser might have joined his father, Rick Mears and A.J. Foyt as a 4-time Indy winner - he would've had at least ten good chances to do it. Andretti might have won a few times, too, or continued to add to his ""Andretti"" curse with more spectacular runs ending in heartbreak. Both would become so experienced at Indy that they would continue to have competitive rides well past 2010, and perhaps would still be racing today at 52 years old.  Meanwhile, younger American drivers might have been inspired to race against these ""giants"" of American racing, preferring Indy cars over NASCAR. Also, Tony Stewart certainly would've lasted longer in Indy cars against more compelling competition than the IRL in 1996-97, and might even have followed Mears and Foyt into stardom if he was successful in beating both Unser and Andretti to Indy victory.  What about the other famous drivers? Emerson Fittipaldi would have retired after 1996 anyway. Paul Tracy had already spent his first 5 years at Indy with unremarkable results (including 1994 when he didn't seem to have the pace of Unser and Fittipaldi in a dominant car) but he nearly won in 2002, so he might've been a multi-year winner as well if he had the chance. And there might have been a rivalry between Tracy and Stewart. That would have been fun to watch."

INDYCAR,3d57je,MR_Rictus,7,Mon Jul 13 16:52:06 2015 UTC,Did they make enough money to cover their costs and what it will cost Andretti Sports Marketing to pay the sanctioning fee next year?  That's what it will come down to.   The decision is essentially in ASM's hands. IndyCar isn't likely to let them have the race again for free or the next thing to it. Not when teams are complaining about the level of prize money.
INDYCAR,3d57je,MiniAndretti,2,Mon Jul 13 17:40:32 2015 UTC,Exactly. Indycar is cutting Road America a nice deal and they will probably have to do it at a highly discounted rate to keep Fontana on the schedule.   Plus if we get an oval short early in the schedule that will probably have to be discounted.
INDYCAR,3d57je,Mikemat5150,3,Mon Jul 13 18:57:07 2015 UTC,"IndyCar needs Auto Club Speedway. ACS will be able to name their terms: fee, race date, and time for the most part if IndyCar wants to keep them around."
INDYCAR,3d57je,MiniAndretti,5,Mon Jul 13 19:32:28 2015 UTC,Absolutely. The mile should be on the schedule permanently. I hope the TV ratings were just as good as the race. It's wonderful to see Indy cars put on such a great show at such a historic track.

INDYCAR,3d4lyv,KE0BVT,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:13:37 2015 UTC,To be fair conway had 2 really scary wrecks at IMS.
INDYCAR,3d4lyv,Rdwomack2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:44:55 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, I think he had a big one in practice at Fontana too that the TV cameras never caught. I think that, coupled with his two big ones at Indy drove him away. Really can't blame the guy. He was excellent on road courses though"
INDYCAR,3d4lyv,-internets,2,Tue Jul 14 16:50:48 2015 UTC,He still is. Some of the passes he made at Belle Isle last year were amazing. Going around the outside of cars on that bumpy course with the walls right there. Nobody was going to stop him winning race one. Also Will Power threw his gloves at Bourdais at some point that weekend.
INDYCAR,3d4pf7,Mikemat5150,2,Mon Jul 13 14:35:07 2015 UTC,Silly thing I just noticed.  Graham Rahal's left arm twitches when he's on a straightaway.  I wonder if that's like the leg shake I do when I'm getting antsy.
INDYCAR,3d4822,MiniAndretti,5,Mon Jul 13 11:46:45 2015 UTC,Of course his comment about the compact schedule ignores the fact that no one shows up for qualifying the day before. That's not just an IndyCar problem.
INDYCAR,3d4822,mcman7890,3,Mon Jul 13 11:47:50 2015 UTC,"To be honest Curt, let's get the races more press and viewers than let's get quailfying live on TV offten before we worry about not give the pole winner enought press in articles."
INDYCAR,3d4822,Mikemat5150,2,Mon Jul 13 13:22:53 2015 UTC,NASCAR qualifying is on live TV. No one cares.
INDYCAR,3d4822,MR_Rictus,2,Mon Jul 13 13:56:48 2015 UTC,"I do agree but he explained it pretty well on Trackside. Imagine being in Milwaukee and seeing on the news that Newgarden was fastest in practice. That may not even be worthy enough to be on the news or it will be short.  If you have the story, Newgarden qualified p1 at 169mph then you have a bit more of a story to get people engaged and get more press out there.  It's a small gripe but I understand it."
INDYCAR,3d4822,MrStarlight,5,Mon Jul 13 14:37:19 2015 UTC,"I don't care about the media's perspective on this one.   I can see it from the team's side: a crash or blown engine in qualifying could be a disaster with the race a couple hours later.   From a fan perspective: the compact schedule makes for a better show. I'm going to Iowa next weekend. The Saturday schedule is jam packed: Lights, Star Mazda, IC qualifying, and race. And with IndyCar qualifying on Saturday, instead of Friday, I get to skip the ARCA race which doesn't interest me in the least."
INDYCAR,3d4m1y,RipVanVVinkle,4,Mon Jul 13 14:07:40 2015 UTC,I've never been to mid-ohio but that sounds like a good plan. As always... Get paddock passes. They're cheap and worth it.
INDYCAR,3d4m1y,InvisibleTeeth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:18:58 2015 UTC,+1 for paddock passes at Mid-Ohio. The level of access you will have is absolutely great. Especially with the observation decks that look down into some of the garages.
INDYCAR,3d4m1y,MiniAndretti,3,Mon Jul 13 15:16:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would do general admission and sit at the entrance of the esses. That's where the race starts and probably the best option for overtaking. Get there early though!"
INDYCAR,3d4m1y,Mikemat5150,2,Mon Jul 13 14:38:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed if you don't get to the Esses early, you will miss out on the prime stops near the top of the hill.  I always paid for the bleacher seats at the bottom of the staightaway. I could watch them come down the straight and through the esses."
INDYCAR,3d4m1y,MiniAndretti,2,Mon Jul 13 15:15:24 2015 UTC,"I chimed in below so I won't repeat myself on those topics. Here is some advice:   Mid-Ohio has one road in and out and is surrounded by corn. Put your patience shoes on when leaving the track. Everybody is trying to beat everyone else out.  The food options are okay but remember to pack a small cooler for drinks. If you buy a paddock pass, which if you are wearing closed toed shoes(Sandals are for some guy named Jesus anyway.) and pants will get you into the pits during practice, pay attention to cooler limits.  If you live in Central Ohio, you know it has been very wet here this Summer. Don't wear shoes you are afraid to get muddy."
INDYCAR,3d4m1y,MiniAndretti,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"Haven't been to Mid-Ohio, but I went to Barber last year, which is a similar type of track. General Admission and a lawn chair is definitely the way to go. If you go for practice and/or quals, you can move around and check out different views as well. There isn't much better though than sitting in your lawn chair watching race cars zoom past. It's such a blast.  If you do go to practice or quals you won't be disappointed, and those are the days to get paddock access. So awesome."
INDYCAR,3d4m1y,TardisKing,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:53:09 2015 UTC,"Ive' been to Mid Ohio quite a bit I live near there. Ill add to what /u/MiniAndretti has already said:  It can also be very hot there this time of year. Make sure you are ready to be out in the sun most of the day. I usually hang out in GA around the esses where there are a line of trees at the top of the hill you can get some shade for a bit without having to take cover from the sun elsewhere.   On race day though that area will be pretty crowded. Also worth noting even though it might be hot and sunny you can still expect there to be some really muddy spots in the low lying areas and on some of the access roads around the track; especially from all the rain we have got this summer.   I will be there hopefully for the race, but I plan on possibly going Friday or Saturday as well.   If you, OP, or anyone else reading this plans on going let me know maybe we can meet up and have a beer together.   I haven't been to the track in a couple of years, but I spent most of my child hood summers. I just got back into Indycar after about 10 years or so away, Im pretty excited to see them again."

INDYCAR,3d28r0,CougarIndy25,2,Mon Jul 13 04:04:14 2015 UTC,You need to move off UStream to a different streaming service.

INDYCAR,3d3cl3,no_comment_necessary,3,Mon Jul 13 04:50:31 2015 UTC,"He was running near the front at Fontana before he wiggled and collected Newgarden.   Quite honestly, I'd be putting the chassis they used last weekend through x-ray to look for a crack in it. Cracks will make the tub flex thus making the handling unpredictable. They definitely are on a tight budget. It wouldn't surprise me if they are patching chassis back together that crashed at Indy or Fontana.   Ed's oval driving skills would have to have fallen off a cliff for him to be as slow as he was this weekend."
INDYCAR,3d3cl3,MiniAndretti,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:39:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking too. It's got to be something. I just don't see how his teammate got the pole and he almost qualified dead last.  I'm a fan a Ed so my post wasn't meant to bash him. It's just odd that he's normally pretty strong on ovals and his season seems to be getting worse"
INDYCAR,3d3cl3,hiking_fool,6,Mon Jul 13 15:29:49 2015 UTC,"What confused me so much was when Newgarden caught him, instead of moving over and letting him by, he held him up so much that Briscoe was able to run Newgarden down, then he still made the pass pretty difficult for Newgarden."
INDYCAR,3d3cl3,hiking_fool,2,Mon Jul 13 15:33:00 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, Ed was about to go a lap down, which I could understand, but yeah it definitely didn't look like he was making it easy on him.  I guess you're a racer in the car and an owner out of it."
INDYCAR,3d3cl3,Rdwomack2,2,Mon Jul 13 16:00:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah he was about to a lap down, but he was dog slow, his team mate and the other car he owns is leading the race and coming up on him quick, there is no reason for him to hold him up. If anything he should have let Newgarden go and tried to hold up Briscoe. I've always liked Ed but that just seemed selfish on his part."
INDYCAR,3d3cl3,furiousjorgey,5,Mon Jul 13 17:22:30 2015 UTC,Eds got wins. Pippa doesn't.   RHR is a champ but has only led laps in 1 race. Helio hasn't seen the winner's circle in 22 races. Doesn't mean either driver is bad.  Its not Ed's season. So what?
INDYCAR,3d3cl3,crblack24,2,Mon Jul 13 05:27:03 2015 UTC,"Ed's definitely got talent, he's proven that, and he's not so old that it's apparent he's past his prime. I think it has to just come down to the new team, he's either not getting the resources he's used to, or his duties as co-owner are taking him from race prep."

INDYCAR,3cpb6p,Mikemat5150,9,Thu Jul 9 18:06:16 2015 UTC,"I think Justin and David underestimate the importance to fans of seeing the entire track at ovals, or at least large portions of it that I don't think this idea would preserve. I also think the cost would at least match installing some revolutionary re-think of the fence.   I think a more realistic solution would combine some of the following elements:   Invent the new affordable clear non-fading protective material or combination of materials that replaces the fence. Materials engineering is a huge field these days. No one had seen anything like the SAFER barrier, and 15 years later it's all over the place.  Just plain remove the first 20 rows to move fans back and up. Those seats aren't very good anyway. Cover them with tarps and lets corporations sponsor the tarps.  KEEP the wonderfully entertaining formula of racing on ovals around long enough to build an audience. This means several years. Stop changing it. Deliver a consistently compelling product.  Push the costs for teams as far down as possible without hurting the racing spectacle. Properly market the races and the drivers. This means a much better and bigger internet/digital effort. The fans we need to be making for their lifetimes use the internet for hours a day. Fix the schedule with consistent dates for events, expand the schedule so we can have events that make seasonal sense for fans (no Houston or Fontana in June).  Have a little patience for a greater economic recovery and for the series to grow again. It won't happen overnight, but we need several years of a consistent strategy to maximize what opportunity there is."
INDYCAR,3cpb6p,chirstopher0us,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:35:52 2015 UTC,Just plain remove the first 20 rows to move fans back and up. Those seats aren't very good anyway. Cover them with tarps and lets corporations sponsor the tarps.   Not sure how all tracks are set up but this could be a problem at some where the entrance to the grandstands are at the bottom.
INDYCAR,3cpb6p,greenslime300,7,Sun Jul 12 20:38:26 2015 UTC,"If you’re struggling to see the flaws – beside cost – in Wilson’s vision, that’s because there may be only one – sightlines.   I can think of a couple more.   What if a track has an infield road course like Daytona? What about team garages, equipment, trailers, etc? What about fans who park and watch in the infield? The outside of a track has much more room than the inside - you have to build towers to fit the same number of people.   It's an interesting idea but no where near feasible."
INDYCAR,3cpb6p,Sallum,2,Thu Jul 9 19:48:20 2015 UTC,"He said he doesn't think this would apply to everything, and maybe only to 1 mile tracks. He also pretty much said this was just a thought, and he doesn't have all the answers. He said it's just an idea he came up with that may help oval racing survive, as it may be on a path to extinction right now"
INDYCAR,3cpb6p,firstplaceagain,4,Fri Jul 10 02:02:44 2015 UTC,"I'm still surprised to see no one talking about doing a double-layered fence.  It'd be awesome if the inner layer had no poles (for driver safety) and was anchored by the stronger outer layer (for fan safety).  I don't see making a better single-layered fence ever really fixing the issue of providing better driver and fan safety.    For better oval attendance, I'd tear down the grandstands and put in rows of platforms like what they have at turn 10 at Road Atlanta all around the track.  Fans can bring in their own chairs and coolers and have more of a campout type feel, rather then uncomfortable bleachers or tight arena seating."
INDYCAR,3cpb6p,malowolf,2,Thu Jul 9 21:15:46 2015 UTC,"The big question I have with double-layer fencing is, again, visibility. An extra layer might not seem like much, but it could greatly exacerbate the already existent ""wall effect"". Stand next to a chain-link fence and look through it at an angle to your left or right. At a certain point, the linkages in the fence are so close together from your perspective that they appear to form a wall and obstruct your vision completely. This isn't that big of a problem with the current fence, but with an extra layer I fear you might not be able to see anything unless it's directly in front of you."
INDYCAR,3cpb6p,Veneficus_Bombulum,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:17:36 2015 UTC,"Two excellent ideas, and much more feasible"
INDYCAR,3cpb6p,-internets,2,Thu Jul 9 21:51:56 2015 UTC,"I like Justin alot and his idea makes sense but I just don't see it happening.  How about giant airbags on the posts of the catch fence? It would absorb a ton of impact, keep drivers from going into the cheese grater, and keep parts from flying into the stands.   The fans view also wouldn't be obstructed during the race.  Sure it would be expensive, but at this point, what isn't going to be expensive.    Thoughts?"
INDYCAR,3cpb6p,no_comment_necessary,2,Thu Jul 9 19:23:11 2015 UTC,"When and how would the airbags be deployed?  After a crash, they probably have to be changed which might increase caution periods."
INDYCAR,3cpb6p,Sallum,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:07:08 2015 UTC,"Well I'm certainly no engineer, but I'm sure there could be some sort of sensor that deploys the airbag upon impact just like in our own vehicles, or shortly before impact would probably be the best bet.    Yes, after the crash they would probably have to be changed, but the way I look at it is this.  Cars just simply do not get into the catch fence that often. It might happen once a year, once every couple years. The delay would be no different than the safety crew coming out to repair the safer barrier or what not.  And also, I could totally see the interest it would create.  It wouldn't happen often but when it does, the headline would read something like ""track airbags deployed in Indycar race"".  Who wouldn't want to see that?  Plus its much better than watching someone die"

INDYCAR,3cq5ff,mcmerctn,4,Thu Jul 9 21:50:45 2015 UTC,"No way. Way too expensive for the teams, under cuts the value of weekend racing, and no one would attend the actual race because they have work."
INDYCAR,3cq5ff,Rdwomack2,2,Thu Jul 9 22:27:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand all of your logic, to be honest. Attendance may not be as high as a conventional Sunday race but the TV contract is so lucrative that surely viewership figures would be much higher than what they get on some saturday evening races, which are on during one of the lowest TV viewing times. If they race on a sunday, then race 8 days later the following monday, and then race 6 days later the next sunday, it's still 3 races in 3 weeks, which is no more than what they do right now. It seems like a good way to get a good TV slot, which is how the NFL grew the sport into prominence in the early 70s by showcasing an exciting product during a time when people were home by devising Monday Night Football. And to your point about under cutting the value of weekend racing, I don't understand how a weeknight race would do that."
INDYCAR,3cq5ff,MiniAndretti,4,Thu Jul 9 22:51:43 2015 UTC,"The tracks don't care about TV ratings.  Your analogy with the NFL is flawed because the teams get the ticket money AND the TV money. The only way a track would agree to it is for waiver of the sanctioning fee. Even then, if they can't make enough at the gate to cover their costs and make money, it would be a no go.  IndyCar would have to pay the tracks."
INDYCAR,3cq5ff,Rdwomack2,5,Thu Jul 9 22:57:05 2015 UTC,"So... All of that is still a raw deal for the track owners, the fans, and the teams. Your entire idea is based around ""No sports on tv on weekdays."" - great. Rebroadcast races then. But holding a race for the sake of TV is a terrible idea."
INDYCAR,3cq5ff,malowolf,2,Thu Jul 9 23:02:29 2015 UTC,"I can't see why holding a race for the sake of TV wouldn't be worth a try when a series is struggling to hit 20% of the viewership of its main rivals. When live online streaming takes over from television then working toward TV will be irrelevant, but that time isn't quite here yet. Rebroadcasting races is a very outdated idea for 2015. I can't see why it could make any sense to a television provider to replace a replay of one show with a replay of another. But if the product is live, then that surely has more appeal than a race replay in an age when one can simply google the result of yesterday's race in an instant.   My main underlying idea is that if we can agree that Indycar puts out a superb product that isn't seen by enough eyeballs be it in person or on media, then surely it would be worth a try to cater some of its product towards the viewing habits and times of casual viewers."
INDYCAR,3cq5ff,d0re,4,Thu Jul 9 23:35:52 2015 UTC,"The TV slot is ideal - racing in Prime Time would probably bring eyes to the sport. In-person attendance would suffer though. I could maybe see it working if the increased TV revenue of putting the race in Prime Time offsets the loss of attendance, to the point where the track could heavily discount the tickets to scrape as many people as they can.    The problem is that even though the race itself may be only 2 hours long, for a fan when you account for travel time it's more of an all-day affair.  Most race tracks are pretty far from city centers, and street races would be difficult since most cities probably don't want their streets closed down in the middle of the week.    It would definitely work if IndyCar shifted to become more of a TV show, but it doesn't really fit with IndyCar's in-person model."
INDYCAR,3cq5ff,crashcarson15,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:13:04 2015 UTC,"You addressed the point that I was thinking about: location. For a mid-week race to have any chance of working, you'd have to be in a high-population area but a permanent racing facility (can't close down city streets on a weekday). There are very few tracks that fit that criteria."
INDYCAR,3cq5ff,emperortomatocatsup,3,Fri Jul 10 18:28:22 2015 UTC,"There’s one market where this could be remotely successful, and that’d be Indianapolis. Ain’t enough interest elsewhere.  Could these IndyCars get around IRP? I don’t know."
INDYCAR,3cq5ff,CougarIndy25,2,Fri Jul 10 00:14:30 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, actually. IndyCar could rent the track for a night and play around with a format that would appeal to TV viewers. Maybe a series of duels (i.e. races between two drivers) with multiple rounds like in the Race of Champions. They could spend more time introducing each driver, because people like competitors with a compelling backstory (think of the prime time game/reality shows). They could also have multiple rounds on different configurations of the facility, to spice things up. Yes, someone would have to pay for all this, but the point is that it might generate higher TV revenue and a major network might consider it worth a try."

But the truth is, so long as cars are racing above whatever the takeoff speed would be, cars will go airborne. The crash that happened Sunday night involved one car ramping off the tire of another, which put air under the car and then another car hitting the airborne car sending it further into the air. It's a freak accident and the only way to prevent freak accidents is not to race. What needs to be done is making sure everything from the cars to the fences are as safe as possible.

However, when you go to an oval and you see the entire field separated by tenths, hundreths, thousandths of seconds simply because of the aero dynamic realities... it's not competition or position earned by merit, but rather by physics.   It takes less skill to even be in the conversation. At an oval, you're not in 4th place because you're the 4th best driver, you're just hanging on to the slip stream. And if you happen to win, it's just because you won the lottery and poked a nose ahead in the last few feet of a race. Not because you legitimately have better racecraft.   Pack racing shenanigans don't separate the good from the bad."
INDYCAR,3cm0ga,MiniAndretti,12,Thu Jul 9 00:30:03 2015 UTC,Except for at Fontana the field did stretch out on longer runs.
INDYCAR,3cm0ga,InvisibleTeeth,11,Thu Jul 9 01:34:06 2015 UTC,Exactly. Fontana was not pack racing...mile and halfs in the 2000's was pack racing.
INDYCAR,3cm0ga,mcmerctn,7,Thu Jul 9 01:47:54 2015 UTC,"This interview was obviously a lot more measured than his post-race one on TV, and I tend to agree with his interview here. The cars don't need to go  to an extreme of strung out racing as we saw at Texas, rather, the cars need a small downforce cut to allow a bit more separation. The California race was nothing like the pack racing I remember at places like Chicago in the mid-2000s, so they aren't too far off of where they need to be, just a small change in tire and downforce would do nicely as he suggested."
INDYCAR,3cm0ga,mcmerctn,2,Thu Jul 9 01:48:20 2015 UTC,"Going back decades, Rick Mears was in favor of narrow tires. It would make a lot of sense at these sorts of tracks if Indycar insists on going there."
INDYCAR,3cm0ga,furiousjorgey,2,Thu Jul 9 02:54:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, narrower tires and a slight downforce cut would be good. Indycar needs big ovals because the big ovals are generally in better financial shape than the small ones and can absorb the 25-30 thousand person crowd Indycar brings, which pales in comparison to the 50-70 thousand person crowds NASCAR brings. NASCAR got the tracks to reconfigure their layouts to make close races for their cars, most notably at Homestead, Phoenix, and Las Vegas. The big venues in big markets tend to have been engineered for NASCAR cars, so I think indycar would absolutely be best off by making adjustments like the narrow tires you suggest to make the cars racy or challenging even at places not designed with their cars in mind."
INDYCAR,3cm0ga,FreeLookMode,11,Thu Jul 9 04:09:22 2015 UTC,He's not wrong
INDYCAR,3cm0ga,darthairbox,2,Thu Jul 9 00:33:03 2015 UTC,"How do we not have boring races that fail to attract fans?  Thats the question I want answered with every discussion complaining about the most popular Indy race of the season, and probably in years.  Make no mistake, I'm not ready to be adamant that Fontana was the perfect ratio between safety and quality product.  Maybe. Maybe not.  But I'm sick of feeling like any time there is a race that stands out in the public's eye as exciting and enticing, what follows is two months of drama, bitching complaining and crying, followed by reactionary responses and shitty racing.  Then we wonder why indycar can't grow an audience.  So.. You feel fontanas formula was too dangerous.  Cool.  How do we fix that AND preseve and improve the quality of the product for fans?  Because we have to, and should want to."

INDYCAR,3cm0ga,MiniAndretti,10,Wed Jul 8 23:43:33 2015 UTC,How dare drivers have to use their brains on short ovals instead of mash gas go fast.
INDYCAR,3cm0ga,MR_Rictus,-2,Thu Jul 9 01:02:46 2015 UTC,If Penske's almighty shock package isn't shining through it's no good.

INDYCAR,3cm0ga,MR_Rictus,-1,Thu Jul 9 16:09:53 2015 UTC,"I get what he's saying and he does have a point, however, he's races for Penske so anything that gives any other team a closer advantage he's not going to agree with. If he raced for a lower tier team, I highly doubt he'd be saying the same thing.  Also, in Fontana, which second tier driver was ever running up front?  Dixon - nope. TK - nope. Helio - nope.  I mean, you could make an argument for Marco or Graham but it's not like they suck.  Briscoe's won 7 races and Ed is no slouch on ovals either.    Edit: ah, the obligatory down votes because I'm not in the Will Power circle jerk. Down vote me, fine. But please tell me why what I wrote wasn't true or relevant to the conversation."
INDYCAR,3cm0ga,jordanl09,2,Thu Jul 9 02:33:16 2015 UTC,I don't like Power. But I agree with him on the Fontana race. I also agree with what you said. Have an upvote to try and climb out of the hole.

The flash point is higher so it's harder to ignite a spill.  Spray enough water on an alcohol fire and it goes out.  Do that with gasoline and it floats on top of the water and spreads faster.  They use a 49:1 mixture of ethanol and gasoline now, which presents less of a skin contact hazard than methanol.  Methanol and ethanol also have high octane (99 octane using the scale used for US pump gas) allowing for higher compression ratios, though they have lower specific energy than gas.  Here's: what that fire would have looked like with gasoline."

INDYCAR,3cilgd,afedyk,14,Wed Jul 8 04:53:11 2015 UTC,"There just need to be more races.  In a longer season.  It's weird: when I'm on /r/nascar, I'm bitching that there are too many races, and the season is too long, but over here, it's the opposite.  These guys (and gals) need more TV time, as much as they can get.  Put your product out there.  Make it a weekly, or like F1, a bi-weekly staple.  Plenty of interviews.  In-car footage.  Driver appearances.  Whatever it takes.  I was hoping that having INDYCAR and NASCAR on NBCSN would help the series cross-promote each other.  Haven't seen it yet, but they need to.  There are some fantastic drivers in INDYCAR, with some awesome personalities.  But the population at large never sees them.  Get them out into the world:  Supermarket openings!  Autograph tables in the mall!  Lined up on Dealership Row at the Chevy and Honda stores!  The week before each race, I would flood the local community with show cars, hero cards, and ticket comps.  People would flock to the race track on Sunday, just to see what all the fuss is about.  ""Oh, look, that's Helio Watzisname in the 3 car!  We met him at the mall the other day.  What a nice guy!!""  That's how it starts.  NASCAR can afford to lock down their drivers and teams -- people are going to go to their races as a matter of course.  INDYCAR doesn't have that luxury.  They need to create their own buzz.  And it needs to be a year-long effort."

INDYCAR,3cilgd,InvisibleTeeth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:14:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%. TV coverage needs to be improved/expanded. More races on ABC would create visibility for the series. NBCSN's coverage is great but those that aren't interested in the series probably don't tune in. I bet we get a certain amount of new fans from ABC because people are flipping the channels and see it on their local station. That's what happened with me.  Promotion of the series with Chevy and Honda would definitely get the word out. A reworking of the schedule to make it longer and at the same time add more races that are evenly spaced out would also be fantastic.  As far as the tracks go, I think the formula that they have now is pretty good. The mixture of street, road, and ovals sets it apart from most racing series which is why I enjoy it more than most. That's probably it's greatest asset IMO because it has a wide appeal to race fans, and the racing doesn't get stale."

INDYCAR,3cilgd,aggresivenapk1n,3,Wed Jul 8 05:41:56 2015 UTC,Exactly. But that's my point.  Barber is a purpose built racing circuit. Not a temporary street setup. These natural terrain road courses are what indycar needs more of.
INDYCAR,3cilgd,InvisibleTeeth,5,Wed Jul 8 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"What the series needs to do, is to focus on getting more races on the schedule in general, of all types of tracks. And they also need to go back to a regular motorsport schedule instead of this nonsense of ending the season in August."

The balance is actually there now but the schedule is too compact and chaotic.   If they drop the ovals, and just leave The 500, there isn't much there to differentiate them from ChampCars failed formula nor Formula 1. Those who espoused 1/3,1/3,1/3 below have the right idea. It can be an successful formula.   The problem is not the racing. Nor the types of tracks. The problem really is delivering the message of how good the product is.

INDYCAR,3cilgd,OldGrumpyRepublican,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:15:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think it has anything to do with the ovals/road courses, American drivers, or length of season debate. Look how many Nascar fans were watching the Fontana race saying how incredible it was and how they wish Nascar was that exciting.  THAT'S what we need to bring in more fans.  Not that the racing hasn't been exciting, but we need to convert other racing fans to Indycar fans to start.  Let's face it, very few people get into racing on their own.  I think most, if not all of us watch racing because our fathers or friends got us into it.  I think most, if not all of us here are race fans and not just Indycar fans.  So if someone said, there's a race series that has awesome racing, you'd probably at least tune in to check it out.  They need to do a better job or promoting/marketing the series.  I watch ESPN and listen to sports radio.  They alway talk about who won the nascar race, but never mention who won the Indycar race.  Also, alot of people that live in the area who ARE race fans say they never hear of any promoting regarding there particular race.  This should be a no brainer. I mean if people that don't follow the sport don't know there's a race, how do they expect anyone other than a die hard fan to show up.  They need to make each race a specticle (I.e. party, extravaganza, etc.)  See Monaco, long Beach, Surfers Paradise.  That's how you get non race fans there.  Basically what I'm saying is, no one that doesn't know anything about Indycar isn't going to say, I'm not watching that because there are too many foreign drivers, not enough races, and we have Nascar for oval (and we have road courses for F1)"

INDYCAR,3cilgd,MiniAndretti,0,Wed Jul 8 14:38:52 2015 UTC,All the series needs is popular American drivers. Indycar is dominated by talent from other countries which isn't a bad thing but when NASCAR has American drivers like dale jr gordon and Stewart it's hard to draw new American fans that's just my personal opinion.
INDYCAR,3cilgd,csasse93,2,Wed Jul 8 17:02:13 2015 UTC,As /u/Mikemat5150 said below there is no silver bullet.  Having some American drivers who are as good as the non-American counterparts is part of the puzzle.

I want to see tracks such as COTA , Imola, Watkins Glen, Sonoma, Circ du Gilles Villeneuve, Suzuka, Albert Park, Sao Palo, Mexico City, it doesn't have to be a huge season, as long as the races that we do see, are epic. and by all that is holy in open wheel racing get rid of the rear fenders."

INDYCAR,3cgd3a,-internets,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:11:28 2015 UTC,Me either! I was just reading up more on the history of USAC today and stumbled across this. I love looking at pictures of old sprint cars because they haven't changed a whole lot. Still as insane today as they were in the 50s.
INDYCAR,3cgd3a,cmd_iii,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:43:05 2015 UTC,"Sprint Car racing is super cool. I think the fact that it's changed so little, like you said, is just amazing. I wonder why rear engines didn't work out for them...? Maybe they just weren't as fast on short ovals and dirt"
INDYCAR,3cgd3a,cmd_iii,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:09:36 2015 UTC,"If you read the article I think the concern was more with the cost of replacing them all. The rear engine cars were more competitive, but it would have killed the sport if the next year they went to rear engined cars. Amazing that a sanctioning organization actually had the interests of the grassroots racer in mind, isn't it?  Here is the excerpt from the article: ""Nevertheless, it was feared that the rear-engined layout would become successful very quickly and instantly render obsolete the front-engined cars (like Indy) necessitating everyone to buy new equipment. The difference was that unlike Indy, not everyone at the short-track level could afford all new cars, which would kill the car counts at races."""
INDYCAR,3cgd3a,cmd_iii,2,Wed Jul 8 00:18:29 2015 UTC,Ahhhh I shoulda read the full article! Thanks. Great find!
INDYCAR,3cgd3a,cmd_iii,2,Wed Jul 8 04:07:18 2015 UTC,"Jim Shampine put together a rear-engined supermodified about 35 years ago.  He had an idea about going to the Indy 500 someday, and figured that getting track-time at Oswego Speedway in a rear-engined ride would be the best ticket for that.  However, Oswego officials were reminded of all of the other times that ""The Pine"" rendered the entire field obsolete with his earlier creations, and quickly put the kibosh on that one."
INDYCAR,3cgd3a,codeflight,2,Wed Jul 8 16:33:33 2015 UTC,That is a really neat looking car! The way the headers just stick straight up like that reminds me of like a top fuel dragster or something of that nature. I guess he did it that way because you can't run them along the side of the car as you can in a front engine application.   I wonder how many of these funky creations there were in the 60s and 70s? I guess not too many as they seem to be outlawed virtually as soon as they popped up.

Guys would get an idea, draw some chalk lines on a garage floor, and start welding up the ole chrome moly.  You can't do that anymore.  Now, it's all factory-built chassis and crate motors.

INDYCAR,3cghee,dbennison,4,Tue Jul 7 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"Cool. Thanks for posting!  I think for these numbers to mean something, there has to be some context to go with it.  Like for example why is Hinch so far up? Is it because he has a win and only 5 starts?  Is your formula based from the beginning of the season? How many races is the ""current"" number based off of and same question for the ""past"" races.    Also, how would we know who the ""hottest"" driver is going into a race for predictability purposes?  And how is that factored?    One last thing, are there any factors that differentiate between ovals and Road courses?  I think these rankings and numbers would be great if we could apply them to something rather than just say like, these are their average finishes"

INDYCAR,3cghee,HGman,2,Wed Jul 8 00:23:37 2015 UTC,Take a look at the About page on the site for this information!  And about Newgarden and Sato: Part of the reason for this is that scores are carried over from past seasons (although they are reverted to the mean by 25% at the end of the season) so they have to build up their good results over the season.

INDYCAR,3c9zh7,Palms1111,4,Mon Jul 6 08:09:57 2015 UTC,"Well, as we in this sub debate what is or isn't pack racing. NASCAR shows just exactly what pack racing is. No one, not even a small group, can pull away from the field.   After the race at Fontana we here were talking about a few degrees of change: a bit less down force or tires that go off a bit faster. I prefer the latter as it will force teams to set up a car for short or long runs. In the end, the group will string out a bit but you will still have good racing.   NASCAR, meanwhile, should be talking about wholesale changes: no restrictors and/or removing several hundred pounds of down force. Given the shitshows Goodyear has had recently, they probably shouldn't mess with the tires.   At least in IndyCar a driver can still pull out and make a move alone. In NASCAR, if you can't convince three guys to go with you, you will go straight to the back."
INDYCAR,3c9zh7,MiniAndretti,2,Mon Jul 6 12:26:23 2015 UTC,"NASCAR actually had a solution where cars could only run in pairs. I forget what year but it was when Trevor Bayne won.

If those motors were allowed to be unrestricted, they'd find out pretty quickly who can actually drive those cars around there.

INDYCAR,3c9zh7,MiniAndretti,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:53:15 2015 UTC,That's because Michigan doesn't need them. They use different aero packages between the super speedways and all the other tracks (save for the 2 road courses).

INDYCAR,3c9zh7,johnnyracer24,0,Tue Jul 7 20:08:56 2015 UTC,"Are you sure they use more downforce at Michigan? I would think the increased downforce would pack up the cars. Instead Michigan drives like a handling track ie ""The team with the best shock set up wins."""

INDYCAR,3c9zh7,b3ttykr0ck3r,4,Mon Jul 6 07:40:17 2015 UTC,"These tracks really need double-layered fencing. One layer of fence is just really scary for fans, it seems like every time a car gets in the fence someone gets hurt (and cars are getting into the fence somewhat frequently). Props if the first layer doesn't have any poles to keep the drivers safe too.    I thought after Wheldon in 2011 that people would look seriously into better fencing. Then I thought people would really look into better fencing after the Kyle Larson wreck at Daytona in 2013 that injured 33 people.  Now this happens 2 years later.  No one seems to be doing anything about updating those fences.   Unfortunately, I have a theory that ISC and SMI do not want to take on the money to R&D better fencing since ovals have been declining in popularity in recent years. The last major safety advancement (SAFER barriers) was pushes by IMS, maybe IMS is the organization that needs to push better fencing too?"

The other thing to remember is that where they are located on the frontstretch they couldn't move before a cwrtain time anyway for the Dillion wreck. They are located just past pit exit, which is where all the other cars ended up spinning toward, then the 2 car was still sliding and had an unpredictable line.

Would it had been just a bit before that photographer would had been hurt or killed and if the 6 would had hit Austin after hitting the fence at full speed it could had been worse. Nascar just dodged a very bad moment."

INDYCAR,3c9zh7,fleshwound_NPG,2,Mon Jul 6 12:27:31 2015 UTC,"If you want any changes, /r/NASCAR is not the place to propose them, regardless of how much sense they may make."
INDYCAR,3c9zh7,cardinals5,3,Mon Jul 6 14:55:26 2015 UTC,"You're projecting a bit much.  I used to post to /r/NASCAR frequently. There are a number of great users there who have great opinions. However, there is a very vocal contingent of that subreddit that opposes any potential change being made to the sport. Literally the only change they can agree with is ""more road courses"".  My statement was a bit flippant, yes...but speaking completely from my own experience, I found the overall attitude of that subreddit slowly became essentially ""Don't mess with the sport, we don't want any changes.""  There's tons of talk about safety, sure. But that talk almost always boiled down to ""Well, duh, it's racing and racing is dangerous."" Which I accept with respect to the drivers. The drivers understand and accept a level of risk behind the wheel. The fans should not be put in harms way. That is what happened last night, and once per year for the last FOUR YEARS at Daytona.  Even something like having a permanent safety crew that reports directly to NASCAR (something that every series should do considering how important safety is) is argued against due to the cost. Yes, the cost is so critical to a multi-billion dollar company that it isn't feasible. Sure.  People in /r/NASCAR aren't stupid, but there's a very stubborn anti-change mentality. That is something I've noticed about NASCAR in general (hello, using carburetors in the 21st century...) but you would expect the internet generation would be more accepting of the concept of change."
INDYCAR,3c9zh7,cardinals5,2,Mon Jul 6 22:41:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've noticed a similar groupthink of ""NASCAR is perfect. Anyone who is involved in it is perfect."" over there. I stopped posting there regularly after I submitted an article about an ex-NASCAR driver getting arrested. It was immediately downvoted with someone saying they were flagging it for a misleading title because the driver wasn't a NASCAR driver, but an ARCA driver. (The guy hadn't raced in NASCAR for about a decade and had recently done a couple of one-off starts). It took about three posts from me posting his stats before they finally admitted that they were wrong and I was right.  It's not as infuriating as the other end of the spectrum with the crowd who thinks their iRacing adventures make them the sole judge of racing talent and anyone whose last name doesn't rhyme with Arson and Hassle are ride-buying hacks, but it's pretty damn close."
INDYCAR,3c9zh7,FancyAndImportantMan,2,Mon Jul 6 23:01:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately it's not a new problem with that sub. It used to be the first place I went to on Reddit. Now I think I've checked it four times in the last year, and that was only for news that wasn't on Jayski yet.  That subreddit is the best example of armchair/Monday morning quarterbacking I've ever seen. Just because you own a G27 racing wheel doesn't mean you know shit about actually racing. And even then, it's not like ride-buying is a new thing. It has been a thing ever since corporate sponsorship came to the sport in the late 60's, and probably even before that."
INDYCAR,3c9zh7,cardinals5,2,Tue Jul 7 12:49:48 2015 UTC,"The whole NASCAR fandom has gone that route. Twitter is even worse. It's hard to believe there was a time when a driver could make a mistake or spin out once and not be called a hack with a million memes/photoshops/novelty accounts to go with it.  The irony is so many of those people bitch about how lam NASCAR is because of bad racing/bland rich drivers. They now have a throwback driver in Keselowski, who worked his way to the top, and everyone shits on him and calls him a horsefaced douchebag because he GASP races people!  Idiocy, pure and simple."

INDYCAR,3c9zh7,FancyAndImportantMan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've noticed that too. My only theory is that it has always been that way, and I'm only noticing it now because I'm comparing it to NASCAR when I was a kid.  I love the ""drivers are so bland and boring"" comments followed by immediate bitching about Kyle Busch and Brad Keselowski. They might be assholes (Brad more so than Kyle, now at least) but at least they put on a show and try to win. Personalities make the sport interesting as much as good racing does. If you can't relate to or pull for a driver, why would you bother? No one is purely a fan of racing...everyone has a driver they root for.  God, maybe NASCAR fans just suck and I'm deluding myself thinking it used to be better."

The esses. Need I say more? Indy GP to 500 to Milwaukee is how it should be. Since we're in Wisconsin, just let the next race be in Road America, where IndyCar should be racing. Lime Rock. Because a road course shorter than Texas Motor Speedway would make for a nice challenge and a switch-up from the long, winding road courses on the schedule. Cleveland Airport. Do it on the 4th of July weekend to support the NHRA event in Norwalk and race on Saturday instead of Sunday. From there it's a short hop to Mid-Ohio the next week. Toronto because it's Toronto. There would be a doubleheader weekend in Pocono, with the first race on Saturday using the roval circuit and the Sunday race using the 500 mile oval configuration. Because if Detroit isn't on this schedule, there should be a doubleheader somewhere! Virginia International Speedway. Because it's a track that's just begging to receive some more attention, oak tree or not. Starting Labor Day weekend would be a string of night races at three ovals: Darlington, Michigan, and Kentucky. Each has its own setup and challenges and can be used as like a mini-Triple Crown. Portland because it's Portland and it would set the stage for... The California Swing. The last three races would start in Sonoma, travel through Laguna Seca and finish in Fontana to end the season. At least that's how I would want my perfect season to be."
INDYCAR,3c7oxe,poprox101,5,Sun Jul 5 22:59:17 2015 UTC,"I've often wondered why they dont at least try to use some rovals, seems like it would be worth a shot."

Three different ovals in three weeks; the oval mini-Triple Crown!"
INDYCAR,3c7oxe,poprox101,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:40:42 2015 UTC,I would find it funny if IndyCar took that Labor Day spot at Darlington just because of the history of that track on Labor Day weekend but I think that weekend is better suited for a street course to limit the interference to local traffic.

Every time I go there for Tudor or something else, I'm always reminded of how borderline insane it is that IndyCar doesn't race on such a wonderful course.

INDYCAR,3c7oxe,CougarIndy25,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:46:08 2015 UTC,"When I think about an ideal schedule, I think about how the circuits should capture a child's imagination. Each circuit should be simple, but contain one or two defining features. They should also be classic circuits that can help educate a new fan about racing history, not just Indy cars but other series as well. Finally, regarding the number of circuits on the schedule, I believe less is more and you can have a very strong series with only 16 races.   Fuji - scenic circuit that hosted Formula 1 and Indy car (and was featured in the arcade game Pole Position!) Phoenix - a uniquely shaped short oval, long-time fixture on the Indy car schedule Long Beach - a classic street circuit and popular event Indianapolis - oval only; the road course is uninspiring Milwaukee - one of the oldest circuits in the US Cleveland - still the best airport circuit, wide, fast and simple Trois Rivieres - simple street circuit but passes underneath an archway Road America - the longest circuit on the schedule Mid-Ohio - another road course which has enjoyed being on the schedule for decades Watkins Glen (long) - classic circuit with fast corners Pikes Peak - a hill climb event, once a part of the Indy car season Pocono - uniquely shaped superspeedway, long-time Indy car race Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez - it's less cool with the removal of the peraltada curve, but now it passes through a stadium which looks spectacular Laguna Seca - classic circuit featuring the Corkscrew Road Atlanta - another venue with a rich sports car history Fontana - the site of the fastest qualifying lap ever"

INDYCAR,3c8bc9,FreeLookMode,11,Sun Jul 5 21:06:50 2015 UTC,"Nay.   But Fontana 2015 was NOT pack racing. it was close racing, it was more of a hybrid between pack racing and short-oval racing (like what we've seen at Iowa). Yes, they're going 3 and 4 wide, but they have enough downforce to be in control. Plus, the track was wide enough to allow for this really interesting hybrid racing."
INDYCAR,3c8bc9,CougarIndy25,5,Mon Jul 6 02:07:34 2015 UTC,"For me it comes down to one thing with pack racing; ""can the pass be completed?"" In Fontana, what we saw was awesome because drivers were able to pass and re-pass each-other with ease. I'm completely ok with this type of pack racing, because people were able to pass both high and low, and it was a mix of strategy and skill as to who won.  In the past, Indycar's have run 2 wide, around Chicagoland for example, wheel to wheel, with neither the outside driver, nor the inside driver able to complete the pass, and it comes down to the smallest thing for who wins it. This is no longer racing, but simply luck.  It's the same problem I have with NASCAR restrictor plate racing. As soon as you have a car that is unable to complete a pass once it breaks the draft, you have a race that is unwatchable for me."
INDYCAR,3c8bc9,therattlingchains,5,Mon Jul 6 00:14:52 2015 UTC,"Always concerned for driver safety first, but gosh darn was Fontana an exciting race, and from flag to flag as well. Really, considering how much was going on, I'm surprised there wasn't more carnage. And, as always, the SAFER barriers and DW12 chassis did their jobs well.  I'm all for it, but I was a NASCAR fan before I was an Indycar fan, so that wheel-to-wheel oval racing really gets me excited. Not that I haven't enjoyed the racing from the past few years, but last weekend's race kept me glued to the TV like none other. Maybe that novelty will wear off, but for now I say let's try to keep a couple races each year aimed at that mark."
INDYCAR,3c8bc9,gheis,4,Sun Jul 5 21:14:56 2015 UTC,"I have been an indycar fan since five years old.  I remember a time when if felt like people accepted that great racing included risk, even danger. Drivers remembered that they were not enslaved and forced into indycar against their will.  They chose to do it and accepted risk.  There was a time when the balance was: maximum safety possible WITHOUT compromising the racing.   To me, that principal has given way to other priorities."

I don't think it was too much pack racing like NASCAR has (each car wheel to wheel and nose to bumper in the draft) and there was a lot of racey moments. The racing I saw in Fontana had me more excited than NASCAR (What I've watched since birth) had in a long time.

INDYCAR,3c6mme,ianindy,2,Sun Jul 5 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"While no announcer combo will ever equal the Murray Walker/Martin Brundle tag-team, IMHO Cheever and Goodyear are alright.  When CBC used to broadcast the Toronto and Vancouver Indy races, we'd get Bobby Unser and perpetual CBC sports guy Brian Williams as the announcers.  Brian Williams would do pretty much all the Olympic sports (both winter and summer), and then switch to Indycar and, I believe, F1.  The drivers' names often baffled him, and if any of the Canadian drivers had a moment of camera time (Paul Tracy, Greg Moore, or Villeneuve in pariticular) he'd go all Murray Walker on them.   And in one race I recall him referring to Robby Gordon as a 'whiner and complianer' numerous times.  Bobby Unser always managed to explain everything about the mid-90s era of Indycar as if we'd never seen a race before ... the tires (or tahrs) were tubeless, since they had no tubes ... the chicanes (or chick-anes) were there to slow the cars down ..   And then, after the race, Brian Williams always had to let us know that Bobby Unser 'had a plane to catch'.  Gee .. I thought he was going to drive home on 'tubless tahrs'."

Honestly, Alan Bestwick, Steve Matchett, and Paul Tracy would be a great trio in the booth, but that's just my opinion. Leigh Diffey is great and all, but all I can relate him to is IMSA.   ABC/ESPN really needs to step it up, they're the only ones who CAN put IndyCar on the standard channels (Fox, NBC, etc.) due to THEIR clause."

Obviously I can't say how confused he was about who the person was that was trying to vector him away from the cars and the other driver, but when I saw it, I thought--you can't push an official.  You just can't.  I'm not a big Rahal fan either, but I never understood how the driver gets the penalty for the fuel hose, air hose stuff.  Isn't the driver reacting to a crew member in front who's telling him to GO, or hearing on his radio to GO?  I don't think he has a good view to be able to verify that the hoses are gone, the hose is retracted, etc.  He has to rely on a signal.  In that case, i think the fine should go to the team.  I know the team will end up paying the fine regardless, but the official blame should go to the team, not the driver."
INDYCAR,3c3w0j,OffissaPup,6,Sat Jul 4 17:54:55 2015 UTC,"The fine is justified, but let's not go overboard. Rule #1 in any form of auto racing is ""keep your hands off a driver just out of the cockpit and full of adrenaline"".   Drivers have reacted considerably worse than Power to being pulled at by officials. It has nothing to do with ""being a hot head"", it's a very human response, and I've seen it happen dozens of times in any form of racing."

INDYCAR,3c1fuy,crashcarson15,-10,Sun Jul 5 02:04:43 2015 UTC,They need to have a summer break like F1. July forth week and the two weeks after would be good for the crews.

There's a ton of cool tracks in Europe,  be great to see the series get back into that market.  Might give f1 a kick in the pants (one can hope).

Which is why indycar will continue to be a low ratings also-ran series when it deserves so much better.  You strive to make the racing as safe as it can be WITHOUT compromising the quality of the product, then every owner, driver and team needs to accept that racing is a dangerous sport and, if they decide to go ahead and compete, stop whining about the best oval racing that fans want to see"
INDYCAR,3c066a,dbennison,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:58:49 2015 UTC,I'm not familiar with ELO but what I've gathered is its some sort of ranking system.  Curious as to why you think that would be necessary.  Don't the point standings do exactly that?  As of right now the championship points leader is Juan Pablo Montoya.  It's hard to argue that he hasn't been the best driver all year
INDYCAR,3c066a,no_comment_necessary,3,Fri Jul 3 19:33:02 2015 UTC,"The main appeal of the Elo ranking system is that it awards consistency over one or two good results. For example, 3 third place finishes would earn more points than a win, a 16th place finish, and a 20th place finish. With the official points standings, you can still rank well in the points with a win and then some lousy performances.  It also does a good job of tracking progress throughout careers and seasons. They're updated after every race based on the average start and average finishing position. Sure, if a guy wins one championship in his career, you could probably say that it was his best year. The Elo system will help identify a driver's best year if he has more than one championship, and also does a better job of sorting out the middle tier guys.  And you mention that Montoya leads the points standings - he also ranks first in the Elo rankings I have done, followed by Castroneves, Dixon, and Power.  If you want to read more about Elo in general, here's a link to the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system"
INDYCAR,3c066a,no_comment_necessary,2,Fri Jul 3 21:23:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  So the Wikipedia page says that it helps predict the outcome of a match.  Using this formula, I'd like to see if it would have said Graham would win  Fontana.  I think it's safe to say he was the hottest driver going into the race"

INDYCAR,3c066a,no_comment_necessary,3,Fri Jul 3 23:24:37 2015 UTC,I actually really like the idea of having a resident statistics analyst or Elo guy hanging around. That could add a little spice to our race threads

INDYCAR,3c066a,rushclay,2,Sun Jul 5 20:52:53 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of taking mechanical DNF's and the difference between teams out of the equation and trying to focus on the drivers only.   It's hard to argue that Montoya hasn't been the best this year... But you could maybe argue that Rahal has actually been better than Will Power this year, but he's behind him in points because Power's in a Penske Chevy while Rahal's on a single car team with a Honda....   That's where statistical models start to be fun. Of course, they don't really mean anything, but if designed well, they can offer a pretty neat perspective"
INDYCAR,3c066a,johnson4253,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Elo system only focuses on results between drivers. In the test I've done, Rahal is actually the driver who has improved the most since last season (+147 points)! Since the system works mainly on average finishing position, it will serve well to track drivers not only throughout the year, but also season to season very well. Since Power has had better results prior to this season, he still has a pretty sizable lead on Rahal right now, though (95 point gap)."
INDYCAR,3c066a,greenslime300,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:50:15 2015 UTC,"I'm unfamiliar with ELO rankings but I saw an article about formula 1 last year that used some fancy model that relied mostly on how drivers performed in comparison to the teammates they've been with. The idea was to take the variance in car performance and the differences of each racing ""era"" out of the equation to determine which drivers where the best.   Here it is. I find this to be incredibly interesting  I don't know how much time you have on your hands, but I think the article does a pretty good job of explaining the model if you want to try to apply it to IndyCar. Here's the same model applied to a single F1 season"
INDYCAR,3c066a,chengg,-5,Sat Jul 4 20:03:20 2015 UTC,"This is not baseball.  I enjoy that we don't have a group of dataheads always punching out numbers that don't validate anything except that the data fits the statistical model.  Even with all of these numbers in boxing and stick & ball sports, you still can't compare one era to another.  If we're just comparing one current driver to another, then you can look at finishing positions.  Now if you want to bring gambling into the picture, then you need to be able to predict.  Gambling on sports has ruined sports."
INDYCAR,3c066a,greenslime300,8,Fri Jul 3 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"this is literally the dumbest comment I have read on this sub. Math explains just about everything, and can be used effectively in racing, it just hasn't yet."
INDYCAR,3c066a,INeedANamePlz,4,Fri Jul 3 18:12:57 2015 UTC,It's hard to say that gambling on sports have ruined sports since gambling on sports has always been around. You would be naive to think it hasn't been.  Edit: Spelling

He should have seen the red ferrari coming up fast though and stayed farther to the left from the beginning and forced red to either sit behind on the left or go right and try the in-and-out at the bottom of the hill.  Red should probably have been a bit more prepared for something like that, though he didn't have much time to react at all."

INDYCAR,3bwyuj,rushclay,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:08:19 2015 UTC,"From red's camera, it looked like he was blocked.  But there seems to be a slight left hand bend that's difficult to pick up on the film.  Watching black's camera, there are no quick moves that indicate he initiated a block.  I agree with the above commenters that black was following his line.    Red got a run going and went for a hole that was closing.  I don't think black should have stayed farther left.  There was a bigger left-hander coming up and he needed to be set up for a transition to the right entering the turn.  Had red's pass succeeded, he would be too far left at a high rate of speed.  It would have been an awkward and rapid move to get right for the next turn.  I've never driven Road America so I can't comment definitively on how much room there was to complete the pass at 150mph."
INDYCAR,3bwyuj,Ptopman,2,Fri Jul 3 06:09:21 2015 UTC,Road America does have a bend in the middle of that straight and most of the driver lines take that apex (if you want to call it an apex). you could fit 3 wide there but its a squeeze.

INDYCAR,3bv9xb,MR_Rictus,3,Thu Jul 2 13:01:01 2015 UTC,I looked at the ticket availability for the race next weekend in case I needed to buy tickets earlier than usual. It looks maybe 25% full. That may be generous. I'm still buying tickets and I hope anyone who can will too!
INDYCAR,3bv9xb,Mikemat5150,3,Thu Jul 2 13:41:06 2015 UTC,"I saw the same thing.  Hopefully there's a decent amount of people waiting for the weather forecast before making the jump to buy, or just doing the walk-up thing."
INDYCAR,3bv9xb,MaKa77,3,Thu Jul 2 14:22:52 2015 UTC,I'm waiting on the weather.  If there was limited availability I'd probably buy now just to guarantee tickets.  But with a mostly empty grandstand I'm not buying until I know it's not going to be a wash-out.  Plus I still have to convince one of my non-indycar fan friends to spend eight hours in the car with me to go to a two hour race.

I wish they could better capture the sense of speed.  Big tall wide angles allow you to see a lot, but unless there's a pass going on those shots aren't really that exciting. They don't capture speed.  I'd love to see in-car cameras and static shots close to the track more often.   Way too often the focus moves away in the middle of a pass. At least show the end of the pass, please. I get way more excited watching 2 drivers duel for a few laps then watching the shot frantically switch between cars halfway through a pass with no frame of reference of how they got there and without knowing what the end result was.  It just gets confusing.  My biggest pet peeve is the lack of crowd noise.  I know, IndyCar crowds may not be huge, but they are still big enough to make noise. It sounds like they don't make any attempt to capture the crowd and let the engines drown out any crowd that's there. I know it may not be easy, but it would really take the broadcasts up a notch."
INDYCAR,3btdsu,malowolf,3,Thu Jul 2 00:47:32 2015 UTC,Thats the deal. There is absolutely no way to comprehend these speeds without seeing a race in person. Ive been to many races with newcomers and it literally blows peoples minds when they see them fly by for the first time. Most people just can't understand what this is about.

A view from the track angle is totally what they need.  Nascar does this where the announcers stop talking and you can just hear and see the cars fly by."
INDYCAR,3btdsu,no_comment_necessary,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:21:06 2015 UTC,"TV coverage is better than it's ever been, but speed is an area where they did better in the past.  They used to have one or two cameras per race and one camera would be mounted high in the infield and would just follow the cars all the way around the track.  That following shot portrayed the speed very well, especially since you could see the operator struggling to keep the car in the center of the frame.  They switch cameras constantly these days.  You don't get a sense of the car flowing around the track.  You're lucky if you see the same car for more than ten seconds.  I don't follow other sports but I agree that Indycar has more effective coverage than NASCAR.  NASCAR is the opposite in that they stay tightly focused on one car for long periods.  But they're zooming in so that you can see the sponsor and they get a kickback for that.  In NASCAR, you only get to see one or two cars interacting most of the time.  When they do in-cars, they do it to show the sponsor's decal in front of the camera, not because there's anything to see."

But you're correct, the shot of in car cameras, wheel to wheel action from the cars perspective, you don't really get at the track. Plus the benefits of slow motion replays, etc.  That's why I always watch the broadcast after going to an event even if I've already seen most of it live.  There's still nothing like the speed and sound of being there that TV does no justice for"

There was a recent Reddit thread about this race.  1999 Portland - While everyone was trying to save fuel, Gil de Ferran drove flat out to build a big enough margin to make an additional pit stop, and then won the race.   2000 Cleveland - Roberto Moreno's first Champ Car victory. It was his first win in 12 years, after an unsuccessful career in Formula 1 with backmarker teams and several more years acting as a ""super sub"" in Champ Car.

INDYCAR,3btmm8,-internets,3,Thu Jul 2 20:33:54 2015 UTC,"Favorite oval in recent memory: Fontana 2012. This was the first non-Indianapolis 500 mile race in a while (Pocono hadn't come back yet) and it was the first night race of its length for Indy. Lots of ebb and flow to this race, and it wound up being a rematch of Kentucky from the year before with Franchitti and Carpenter. Carpenter won again, which not only got him out of the one-win club, but it was also his first win as an owner/driver. EDIT: And I hadn't even gotten to the championship drama in that race!  Favorite road/street course in recent memory: Tie between Cleveland 2007 and Sao Paulo 2013. Cleveland's last race to date and Paul Tracy's final open wheel win, coming back from a first lap incident (because Cleveland) and proving he had one more win in him. And Sao Paulo was just really fun racing all day long, and quite the interesting top five at the end of the race. Also nice knowing that Newgarden eventually paid his dues and won since then."

I don't know if IndyCar has a few different rules on pit equipment like NASCAR does, but clearly a piece of equipment left the pitstall, causing debris to fall onto the track, causing the caution. That would have been an instant stop and go penalty for someone in NASCAR for sure. Now would it have changed the outcome of how Rahal would have finished? Maybe, but waiting for a half a week for a slap on the hand, wag of the finger, no-no, penalty was pretty bad."

INDYCAR,3bsenu,RexCrater,0,Thu Jul 2 01:34:21 2015 UTC,"I think the problem stems from Indycar officials holding no standards whatsoever when it comes to breaking the rules. They just ignore them when they feel its convenient for the race and dont issue penalties, yet issue them for infractions that are more minor than the ones ignored. A infraction of the rules is an infraction, there shouldn't be any grey area, otherwise drivers and teams will eventually try and test the limit of what they can get away with. Frankly, I think this getting fined after the race shit is ridiculous when the infraction affected the outcome of the race, and is just a way for them to cover themselves from having to make any ""difficult"" calls at all. Last year, there were drivers making contact left and right on street circuits all the time, ruining the integrity of the race. Once they started calling penalties for the worst offenders on a more regular basis the racing became much cleaner and more exiting, and not marred by yellow flags. If it's a penalty then they should get a drive-thru, anything less and your just letting politics and sloppy enforcement ruin the race, not to mention the safety of the drivers. The officials need to grow a spine."
INDYCAR,3bs1sk,mcman7890,5,Wed Jul 1 18:09:06 2015 UTC,"16 races?  That's really just absolutely not enough. That's twenty less than NASCAR. How are you going to keep in the interest of a 21st Century audience with a 16 race schedule...  Lower your sanctioning fee for now. Get the schedule you want, and slowly raise the fee as your series becomes closer to actually worth it..."
INDYCAR,3bs1sk,fifty-two,3,Wed Jul 1 20:46:06 2015 UTC,"I think that's kinda-sorta what Tony George tried to do, except he never got the point where he could raise the sanctioning fees. The series was just perpetually loosing money, and I don't think they are going to want to spring for that strategy a second time.  Instead, I'd rather see IndyCar promote some races themselves."
INDYCAR,3bs1sk,malowolf,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:02:56 2015 UTC,That's kinda what they're doing now. I've heard a lot of the newer races have been lower up front money along with the newer ones added. I've heard from people at Road America this weekend that they will reimburse the track for any money they can't recoup from the sanctioning fee.
INDYCAR,3bs1sk,Mikemat5150,3,Wed Jul 1 21:14:16 2015 UTC,"That's a perfect number for me.  There's so much to balance in creating a schedule, but what effects me most is how tight the schedule is.  More room to catch up and to breathe means that teams with less budget can still compete.  If you want this series to grow, you have to treat the teams with respect and fairness.  All the teams are running a business.  You can't expect teams to just come up with 30% more budget next year because you want to run more races.  It's a a tough balance, I'm sure, but the team's success as a business is the most important thing to grow the series."
INDYCAR,3bs1sk,DataRacerSmith,2,Wed Jul 1 21:57:36 2015 UTC,"I just can't agree with that. If the teams truly are having that much trouble, then we need to do something to make it easier for them.

By the IndyCar is not only old news, but history to the mainstream audiences.   You can't grow an audience if you're forgotten, and multi-week breaks in the schedule are death for a sporting league.   If the teams can't do it, we need to figure out how to get them to be able to do it. Not blaming them, just saying it's something that needs to be on the list of priorities."
INDYCAR,3bs1sk,fifty-two,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:02:15 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see 18 to 20 races a season from February through October.   Everyone agrees that NASCAR's 36 races is about ten too many.  It would help Indycar if the races were laid out when every other week so you instinctively knew whether there was a race on this week.  I personally don't like the Saturday/Sunday doubleheaders but it works for other people and for Indycar.  I would like to see all races on the same day of the week.  Saturday looks good, fewer professional sports to compete against for airtime.  And screw those with short attention spans.  They're defective units."
INDYCAR,3bs1sk,rushclay,3,Wed Jul 1 23:33:47 2015 UTC,"This is worth an add on: ""What I didn't love was our some of our stakeholders ... Really going too far with their public statements,"" Miles says of teams/drivers. Miles calls post-Fontana comments ""damaging to the series."" He says there will be ""change in our attitude"" regarding criticism."
INDYCAR,3bs1sk,malowolf,3,Wed Jul 1 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"Wanna try that again?     Mark Miles was disappointed by the comments made after the race on Saturday. There will be no sanctions placed on anyone for those comments, but he alluded that those types of comments will not be tolerated in the future.   Miles said before the Fontana race, drivers were not in agreement on how the race would unfold.   About the Fontana race, he said they likely went a little too far with downforce, but part of the problem was lower temperatures then they were expecting.   Miles called the aero kits a ""mixed-bag"", though mentioned that Montoya felt the aero kits worked at Indianapolis.   He understands Fontana does not want to race in the summer, and is open to Fontana returning for a race in the Fall.   He knows the schedule is a big issue.  He plans on having a 7-month 16-race schedule next year.  There may be races after Labor Day, but restated that TV post Labor Day is challenging.   It sounds like both Miles and track promoters want an IndyCar race in Phoenix, the issue is finding a place on the schedule. Miles was open to a February date, but the final decision in in Phoenix's hands.    (From Curt Cavin's and Marshall Pruett's twitter feed)"
INDYCAR,3bs1sk,MiniAndretti,3,Wed Jul 1 19:01:50 2015 UTC,"Phoenix or Auto Club in February would be very good.   Regarding post-race comments, I can see where Miles is frustrated by people airing the laundry in public. But he needs to be careful not to become NASCAR in this regard."
INDYCAR,3bs1sk,malowolf,4,Wed Jul 1 19:21:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd love for the season to start in Phoenix in mid February and end at Fontana in mid September.  That would really answer a lot people's complaints about the schedule.    As far as post-race comments go, I'm pretty sure any major sports outside IndyCar would come down hard on guys like Will Power and Tony Kanaan for what they said. It's not just a NASCAR thing."

I still need to watch the first 95% of the race to get a really good idea of what was going on though.  I would definitely look forward to a Phoenix race (especially one at night, which only the Camping World Truck Series has right now), and Fontana after Labor Day. Any attempt to end the season with a 500 mile race is fine as long as the weather is reasonable. Bring on Road America too."

I'll watch the Daytona 500, but most other NASCAR races don't keep my attention and I don't really seek them out. It's the same with F1, I usually don't have the time to watch it live and it's difficult to go back and watch after the fact, and even when I do I sometimes end up bored. I watched a Formula E race, but slow formula cars just didn't do it for me.  I really want to get into GRC, but I just haven't found the time to catch up on this season. I also wanted to watch Tudor, but Balance of Power nonsense, the Pro/Am concept, and trying to keep track of the different classes just collectively kinda turns me off; I'm still hoping they streamline that series a little.

Sports car racing doesn't have consistent coverage and I don't plan my days around TV schedules.  NASCAR is on virtually every week from March to November.  It's on one of two channels and they each cover a specific portion of the season.  The races are very long, so you'll probably catch a lot of the race even if you don't know the start time.  I used to watch F1.  I stopped about 15 years ago because all the racing was confined to the race strategist's computer.  I watch all 24 Hours of LeMans every year.  If I had my choice, my 2nd favorite series is SCCA production car racing.  Only the national finals are on TV and they are on an obscure channel.  Most racing used to be cars that you could buy.

Surely officials aren’t saying to themselves, “we need to make this as dangerous as possible, and if someone dies then so be it.”   How about this side note gem?  “…those cheese-grater debris fences and metal fence posts still in place (by the way, is anyone actually doing anything to solve that problem?)”   What exactly would be the solution to this problem?  Something has to be in place to keep the cars and spectators separated. Is the current fencing not the acceptable best practice across all of motorsports?"

It's just what we do, you aren't a racer if you don't put the fear and risks past you, plain and simple. Are there steps IndyCar can take to make racing safer? Of course, and I'm 100% sure they will. Furthermore, the danger is always there, go-karts to IndyCars. As the late Dan Wheldon once said about being hurt/killed in racing ""Do I think it's going to happen to me? No. Could it happen to me? Absolutely."" The risks are there, but the racers will look past them and IndyCar will try to remove them. Plain and simple."

So the answer to the question is obviously no, the powers that be should not risk another humans life at the benefit to build their organization.    Now, with that being said, these drivers know the risk and choose to do this sport for a living. They KNOW they can die doing it, they've seen their friends and fellow racers die doing it, and guess what? THEY KEEP FUCKING DOING IT!  How is it any different than the guy that walks a tight rope across the grand canyon, or the x games guys that do triple back flips on their motorcycles, or the base jumping guys?  They do it for an audience and for the thrill. Granted, it doesn't need to be more dangerous than necessary, but at the same time, like Carpenter said, if you don't like it or don't want to do it, then dont.  If my boss told me I had to do something that risked my life, if I didn't want to do it, then I'd quit. What makes these guys any different? Because they make more money? Because they're celebrities.

The goal for the sport should be to maximize safety as much as possible without compromising the integrity of the product.

INDYCAR,3bnscy,Gus_TheAnt,4,Wed Jul 1 11:02:08 2015 UTC,Think about it from nascar's perspective. What do they gain from this? Maybe a couple thousand extra people in the stands but they're still brining 95% of people. Plus their cars are made to look super slow compared to an Indycar.   It would be awesome but the upside is all on Indycar and not Nascar.

INDYCAR,3boszq,Mikemat5150,2,Wed Jul 1 00:58:49 2015 UTC,"The fence still gave way too much though. Look at the amount of debris that came flying towards the spectators, especially part of the fence. If the car came crashing into it a couple hundred feet farther down the track, there could have been some serious spectator injuries"
INDYCAR,3boszq,greenslime300,3,Wed Jul 1 03:13:22 2015 UTC,"That's what catchfences always do. In crashes like this, they aren't designed to stop debris, they're designed to stop cars, which this did perfectly. If it can hold back a full-bodied sports car, it can contain a single-seater easily."

It looks to me like the nearest spectators are where the video is being shot from, but I'm not familiar with the spectator areas of Road America.  What I see is the catch fence flying out, towards the camera as the guy taking the video pans to follow the crash."
INDYCAR,3boszq,greenslime300,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:01:40 2015 UTC,"I was standing at this break marker (marker 3 before turn 5) watching PWC GT practice the day before.  You can walk the entire length of that straight. Spectators, at this point, are separated from the circuit by the catch fence, about a 5 yard ditch, and then another 5 ft fence. Specators down the track - toward turn 5 - only get further from the circuit, not closer. So it happening further down would have been equal to, if not better, for safety."

INDYCAR,3boszq,greenslime300,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:56:54 2015 UTC,No this is new. They added new catch fencing in at various positions around the track. Here and Turn 12 are where I noticed the changes most this past weekend.

I don't think the death of a racing driver every five years or so is a critical issue.  If we're going to increase safety, we're doing it in the wrong place.  Planes crash all of the time.

Eventually I grew tired of hearing how everything was better in 1940 and came over here, this place has been a breath of fresh air, but I do see where you're coming from for sure. I'm definitely enjoying IndyCar in its current state, and coming from the Champ Car side of the fence and it took me a long time to give IndyCar a shot. I've accepted that this is what American open wheel racing is now and have decided to make the most of it and I'm glad that I have. I've even gotten some friends and coworkers into it as well. Once everyone stops trying to go back in time to grab what is no longer there, we can focus on moving forward collectively."
INDYCAR,3bna52,FormulaT1,3,Tue Jun 30 17:02:50 2015 UTC,"I second that wholly.  TF sucks, and this sub has been a massive dose of positivity.  The sooner people accept American open wheel racing for what it is, the better."

Just because someone doesn't agree or voices an opinion on why it should/could be different, doesn't mean it's ""negative"".  I think back and forth discussions are good for the sport, it gives people a reason to talk about it.  People like controversy"
INDYCAR,3bna52,no_comment_necessary,8,Tue Jun 30 16:52:53 2015 UTC,Here's my thoughts on this. I completly agree with this and I thing /r/indycar does a GREAT job welcoming new fans and turning them on to whats great about this sport.
INDYCAR,3bna52,mcman7890,3,Tue Jun 30 17:03:30 2015 UTC,I find this sub quite positive for new fans. People seem more than happy to answer questions and share their passion. You'll always see recommendations of past races and links to watch them.
INDYCAR,3bna52,25Tab,6,Wed Jul 1 01:05:06 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'm all for being critical and voicing an opinion, good or bad, but the negativity is sometimes just off the walls. At least it's not Trackforum. I keep posting less and less.   Are things perfect? No. They could be a lot worse though. I'm enjoying myself and will continue to do so!"
INDYCAR,3bna52,Mikemat5150,6,Tue Jun 30 16:46:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  We all need to be advocates for IndyCar.  A lot of what sets this community apart of Track Forum / Facebook or whatever is that we generally have a positive attitude, understand the sport better and genuinely want the sport to survive and flourish.  We love IndyCar.  Thats why we're here.  We only want the best for it.  One thing I wish, especially as a mod, is that we'd have more involvement from IndyCar here.  I think we'd all love to see more AMAs with drivers especially but also crew and other people close to IndyCar.  Maybe a Robin Miller AMA???  That could be fun.  I'd also like to see some sort of partnership... maybe a link to this from IndyCar.com (though maybe they dont want it to be too official because they can't really control it)    Take a look at /r/NASCAR - in the sidebar they have donations section.  I believe this changed frequently, but is always going to some cause that one of the drivers or NASCAR or whoever has setup.  Pretty cool I think.  I'd like to do something like that too.  It might help us gain attention from IndyCar."
INDYCAR,3bna52,mswizzle83,4,Tue Jun 30 18:50:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly this is just more of the same just from a different angle. Instead of complaining about the series you're blaming the fans. I don't feel like that is any more productive. People bitch and moan about sports - that's part of sports.  I don't stop watching the NFL because people complain about Goodell, refs, stupid greedy owners, etc nor do I stop watching Formula 1 because of the constant bitching in /r/Formula1 about Ecclestone, the FIA, tires, etc.  The fans that are around Indycar have a right to complain because they are the reason the series is alive. If Indycar gains in popularity, in my opinion, today's fans will have even more of a right to complain in the future - if they so wish.  Beggars can't be choosers. That anyone says anything about Indycar at all these days, in my book, it is positive for Indycar.  I fail to see how sharing my opinion on the Indycar subreddit is going to damage the sport or potential fans. I'm watching races every week, going to races, etc.   I'll share my opinion and you share yours. You can think mine is bad for the sport or not if you like."
INDYCAR,3bna52,MR_Rictus,3,Tue Jun 30 19:30:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know why this board is so masochistic. IRL killed American open wheel racing. It's that simple. We had many engine suppliers, chassis manufacturers, big name racers, a large calendar at great tracks (permanent and temporary) throughout the United States and abroad, and Formula 1 competitors and reigning champions coming into the sport.  Tony George and the IRL ruined all of that. At no point am I or anyone else with a brain going to forgive that.  It is not my job to be an IRL apologist, but it might be my responsibility to educate newer fans on what once was, so they might influence its improvement one day."

INDYCAR,3bna52,Gus_TheAnt,3,Wed Jul 1 11:17:05 2015 UTC,"Long story short, as I understand it (I was 6 at the time):  In 1996, IndyCar was sanctioned by CART (Championship Auto Racing Teams). CART ran a fantastic series, which attracted top-level drivers from all over the world. In 1993, the reigning F1 Champion (Nigel Mansell) defected to CART. CART had teams in a position on a board to decide the fat of the series. The owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Tony George, wanted a position on the board. CART said, ""lol no, sorry, this is for car owners, not track owners."" They eventually compromised and gave him a non-voting position on the board. This wasn't good enough for the... guy... and he yanked Indy off the CART calendar, and started his own series called the Indy Racing League. This is called the ""split.""   The IRL had worse drivers, all-oval tracks, and slow, ugly, unsafe cars. It also was formed with xenophobic roots, trying to seat Americans in cars, even if they couldn't drive worth anything. But it had the Indy 500, and so while CART continued on for another 11 years with superior racing in every respect, the money ended up winning. CART died, was bought by the IRL, in 2008.  Meanwhile, Tony George was ousted from IMS by his own family after merger.   Ever since 1996, it's been downhill for American Open Wheel Racing. All thanks to the actions of Tony George.   I have a biased view according to some, by blaming this all on Tony George. But I believe it also has the benefit of being true."

I agree, Indycar needs some serious changes and I think we should feel free to voice those opinions in this forum. I don't think people who criticize Indycar want to destroy it. Rather it's because of passion for the sport that we want the world to watch it again, but first the sport needs to improve before more people will want to."
INDYCAR,3bna52,emperortomatocatsup,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:58:04 2015 UTC,"Reddit has a real tendency to believe what it wants to believe, especially when things have gotten worse.

At the end of the day, I make a point of acknowledging reality and bringing it to other people because a society of miserable people might do something to improve, but a delusional one will just extol the pleasures of shoveling shit."
INDYCAR,3bna52,Goober15x70,2,Wed Jul 1 07:16:18 2015 UTC,"To just say we should return to 1993 - 1995 should be based on what?  You can't ignore the economics surrounding all of motor sport. You are free to continue to flay the dead horse that is ""the split"". But rather than constantly looking to the past, you can use some of the lessons of the past and adapt them to the present day.   The racing right now is as good as it has ever been. Yes, I've watched CART, IRL, ChampCar, and IndyCar. Further, IndyCar has the best on track product out there right now. It's certainly better than NASCAR. It's more competitive than F1. And the Tudor Series is a nightmare with the travesty that is the treatment of the LMP2 cars in favor of those awful DPs.   Could the series stand to get out of its own way at times? Yes. Mark Miles needs an advisor who knows something about racing to help him make the schedule decisions. The Hulman-George Family needs to loosen the purse strings a bit to sweeten the pot.   Having the Hulman-George family own IndyCar is not a bad thing. There is a reason ChampCar failed. You can't have car owners running the series. You should listen to them. But having them make all the decisions is a bad idea.   In the end it all comes down to marketing. Someone needs to properly promote the hell out of this series and the feeder series. They need to generate interest that turns into ticket sales. Everything flows from that. Everything.   The tobacco money is never going to return. That money propped up many series, even F1, for a long time. Now you have to do it organically."

Just some days before it I thought how people were happy with the way oval racing was before the mid 90s, and how all but 2-3 cars used to go a lap down and nobody saw a problem in it - the winners just really undoubtedly won over the others. Once pack racing showed up, and once it got people loving it, it would never be forgotten by its loyal fans. So now and in the future, we'll have a series that just won't be able to make both parties happy, because they are basically interested in the exact opposite things."

Yes, when the leader laps the entire field by the half-way point, you can feel confident that his setup and/or skill was superior to the competition. But holy shit that kind of race is incredibly boring to watch. I find it so funny that all these dissenters start their comments with ""I know it was exciting for fans, BUT..."".  This is a professional racing league that only exists through pleasing their fans, if fans want to see racing like that then how can you say it's wrong for the sport?

JPM is hot now, but so was Jeff Gordon last year.  He's on his last shot of adrenaline to prove he's still got it, and will leave soon if he wins the championship.  He's 39.  With the lineup he has now, I'd keep all of them too.  But as two retire, I have doubts that he will fill both their seats.  Power probably has a job there for as long as he wants.  Pagenaud is good and if he gets along with Power, he's secure for a couple of years."

Coming from a big Formula 1 fan, I have never been exited like this race got me. This season in F1, It has been so dry that I don't even pay attention to it, Its just in the background for noise or the 1 or 3 mishaps during the race.

The banking is so high at Texas the cars stay glued to the track at much higher speeds. It's the same reason cart could run Indy fine but people were blacking out at Texas.
INDYCAR,3bn3wq,Mikemat5150,2,Wed Jul 1 11:16:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for responding I see your point on the banking!  Sadly I was at the race and it just seemed stale nothing too special once the runs got going. I just wish I could go to indy or california to see that great racing

I think they could've used a bit more downforce but Texas is so tricky. Too much and you're in a very dangerous pack racing situation. 1.5 mile ovals simply aren't that good for Indycar.

It's easy to think that watching Lebron James dunk on someone 7 feet tall, or seeing Aaron Rodgers put a pass on the money from 50 yards away, or seeing Albert Pujols launch a 450 foot home run.   In auto racing, it's tougher, since the thing people equate it to is driving down the street in their own car. Too many races I've watched with friends, to them it looked like everyone when out, drove around, and collected their check when it was over. Watching the race Saturday, you could feel the drivers giving their all just by watching. You could see them putting it all on the line racing inches apart. It needs that element of people pushing their car to it's absolute limit, putting themselves at risk for the ultimate prize of victory.  I look to Ayrton Senna, driving a 1000 HP McLaren with little downforce, manual gearbox, and steering it with 1 fucking hand. Even the drivers today are in awe of how much skill and guts it took, and any average Joe could look at that and know how much talent it takes. Compare that to how many NASCAR races I've watched where everyone rides around, no passing, no action, and the drivers get out after the race and talk about their ""great points day"", and it makes you realize why racing culture is declining around the world.  We can't take away that excitement from racing."

INDYCAR,3bn3wq,no_comment_necessary,4,Tue Jun 30 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting predicament that IndyCar, and maybe all of Motorsports,  has found it itself in.  Nobody wants to see drivers get hurt or killed, but the racing is most exciting when it's dangerous.  Safety measures over the years have slowed down the cars, slowed down the tracks, and spread everyone out so that no one is in real danger.  And it's worked - less drivers are being hurt and killed then ever before. But interest in the sport has also waned, and the younger generation of sports fans find racing to be really boring.  How do you make the sport more exciting without making it more dangerous or gimmicky?"
INDYCAR,3bn3wq,rushclay,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:48:11 2015 UTC,"If drivers think that they can crash at will with no consequences, it will turn into NASCAR where drivers routinely bump and push their way to the front and there are dozens of cautions per race."
INDYCAR,3bn3wq,chavz25,4,Tue Jun 30 23:46:54 2015 UTC,"A lot of people forget that racing is dangerous! Two people trying to go faster than each other will sometimes end badly. We can never make it 100% safe. In the end its down to the drivers, and as we see the young guys with nothing to lose don't mind that kind of racing meanwhile the older generation of drivers think it's crazy to risk their life. But maybe we need that to intice the fans back, the people sick of watching the formula 1 parade or the scripted green white checkered shoot out of nascar. Why did formula get big? It wasnt the development of cars that made it popular it was that on average 2 drivers died a year and everyone was content with that. Why did nascar  get famous as late comedian Robin williams said ""I watch nascar for the racing. Ya and i watch porn for the acting, you liar! I am all for danger in the sport and as much as people compare Fontana to 2011 las Vegas those are two different monsters. Vegas was way faster more steeply banked and had shorter stretches. Not to mention almost 10 more cars on the track! 2011 was pack racing Fontana was guys getting runs to the front with the draft not everyone side by side 8 rows back. Everyone agrees the race was entertaining and one of the best all season. Beside the last accident (which let's be honest is a areokit problem not a racing problem) it was safe. That type of racing should stay!"

INDYCAR,3bjchg,no_comment_necessary,15,Mon Jun 29 18:22:38 2015 UTC,"As much as I like Graham, I agree that he should have gotten a drive through penalty, especially when Newgarden got a penalty last year for running over an air hose which essentially lost him the race.  Agree completely about the Coyne pit crew.    I have a question concerning the Coyne team that I was going to create a new post for, but may as well ask here.  They have two sub-par cars that are consistently at the bottom.  Why?  Why don't they get rid of a car and just have one car and driver that they can put more money into and work on getting good finishes.  I get that they have had to scramble with Huerta out, but they've been terrible.  I don't think they even have sponsors?  I was at the Texas race and seem to remember that neither of their cars had sponsors on them anywhere.  Edit Just saw a post about how as of this season, all pit safety infractions are now dealt with post-race, so that explains why Rahal didn't get a penalty."
INDYCAR,3bjchg,jaredog,5,Mon Jun 29 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"Response to the question about Dale Coyne Racing. Now I know they were recently winners, but for much of their existence their purpose was more about giving drivers opportunities that they might otherwise not have. The team almost always had two cars - that just seems to be their philosophy. They've had the good fortune to employ some great drivers recently, but I believe at its core, the team is happy to do what it takes to survive and continue to give people chances. Sometimes you get future stars like Paul Tracy, and many times you get ride buyers. A more interesting example might be Charlie Nearburg, an old rookie who raced in 1997. Dale Coyne would say of him: ""Charlie Nearburg is an example I love – he was a guy that was older, he was married, he had kids and always wanted to do these races. So he came with us, and did three races, and we pushed him a little bit, but the by the time he got to his third race, he was very respectable – and he’s got that to carry with him the rest of his life."" Anyhow, you've got to give credit to the team for its longevity - they are even older than Chip Ganassi Racing. I'd love to hear Dale Coyne's personal assessment of his career once he retires - so he hasn't been a winning owner like Penske or Ganassi - I don't know if that's ever his goal - but I don't doubt he has as much passion doing what he does, and the sport is better for it."

INDYCAR,3bjchg,jaredog,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:24:18 2015 UTC,"Dealing with pit safety incidents after the race is reasonable, but to me there should be a penalty when it causes a caution and disrupts the flow of the race.

And going to a one-car team could get them some results while saving money!"
INDYCAR,3bjchg,CurvyVolvo,11,Mon Jun 29 22:54:31 2015 UTC,"I think Dayle Coyne's entire organization needs to get their shit together. At this point, I've lost track of who's driving for them."
INDYCAR,3bjchg,russlar,20,Mon Jun 29 18:59:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know why everyone keeps singling out Power here. He was a little more outspoken than Cindric, Montoya and Kanaan but he also just crashed out. He also was hurt pretty bad in the Vegas crash so he probably has some strong feelings about it.  He voiced his concerns before the race and after. People like Ed that tell him to stop voicing his concern, for his life, or retire are even more out of line.   They've done pitlane infractions after the race all year so they are being consistent. I don't particularly care for it especially since it brought out a caution but they are consistent.   I agree with you on number 4 completely. I feel as though you have almost a split reaction with both extremes being the most vocal and hyperbolizing everything. Was it too much, no. Should it be changed, maybe. I think it will only be a problem at Fontana because like you said, so many lanes to drive.   I'm jealous you got to go. Looked like an awesome race to see."

INDYCAR,3bjchg,11by3,2,Mon Jun 29 21:10:15 2015 UTC,"People are singling him out because he's always bitching about something.  I don't have a problem with what he said about just this race, but it's always something with him.  He's a hell of a race car driver but he's a bit of a primadonna. It's easy to single someone out like that.  Pushing the safety guy, come on man. That's just dumb.  I understand tensions are high, but be a professional.  It's never his fault either. I guess he's the Indycar villan.  It's good for the sport so be it.  I think most people have a driver they don't like.  He's good too.  Whenever you're one of the best, there's going to be people that don't like you.  He just helps people not liking him by the way he acts."
INDYCAR,3bjchg,11by3,4,Mon Jun 29 19:01:18 2015 UTC,"Power does complain, but not a whole lot more than other drivers. He also will admit his mistakes and when things are his fault. If you would have made this comment 4 years ago I would agree, but in recent years he has taken blame when necessary or simply say ""I screwed up"". You obviously don't like him, which is fine, but to single him out when other CHAMPIONS are making the exact same complaint is silly."
INDYCAR,3bjchg,11by3,-2,Mon Jun 29 20:14:02 2015 UTC,"I wasn't singling him out because he was making the same complaint. In fact, I had no problem with what he said if he thought the racing was dangerous.  However, he was obviously pissed because he thought Sato took him out.  When actually it was power that went down on him. In my opinion it was a racing incident and I don't want to get into who's fault it was.  All I'm saying is the guys is always crying about something.  How often do you hear Dixon or TK, or JPM cry. Not nearly as often for sure."
INDYCAR,3bjchg,malowolf,2,Mon Jun 29 20:34:58 2015 UTC,"Power came down a bit, Dixon came up... why not call out Dixon for coming up and initating the contact?

INDYCAR,3bjchg,InvisibleTeeth,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:38:20 2015 UTC,"All drivers speak their mind.  When Power does it, it seems like he's crying.  That's just my opinion. The guy rubs me the wrong way.  He a professional in talent, but not in personality. When he flipped the birds, I mean come on man, how unprofessional is that (whether he had a point or not).  I actually laughed and got a chuckle out of it. It was entertaining for sure, but not how you want a champion to act.  Pushing the safety guy. For what? What did the safety guy do, other than might save his life one day.  Maybe the guys just a hot head. There's nothing wrong with showing emotion, being mad, being dissapointed, but at times he just acts like a little bitch and it's becoming annoying"
INDYCAR,3bjchg,malowolf,0,Mon Jun 29 20:59:18 2015 UTC,"you are absolutely entitled to your opinion, I just feel like you contradict yourself a lot. You hated that he did the birds, but you were entertained by it? If he was a robot with no emotions, you'd bitch about that too."
INDYCAR,3bjchg,-internets,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:37:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't say I hated that he flipped the birds. I just said it was unprofessional. It's kind of like when your 2 year old says their first curse word. You kind of laugh because it's kind of funny, but you know it's wrong and they shouldn't be doing it.  And I brought that particular instance up just to show that I'm being as unbiased as possible.  Just because he rubs me the wrong way, doesn't mean I didn't find what he did funny.  Bottom line is, if he's right, he's right. If he's wrong, he's wrong.  I'm just saying it's always something with him. I don't always disagree with him just because I don't like him."
INDYCAR,3bjchg,mswizzle83,4,Tue Jun 30 15:45:53 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing Rahal's team will get a hefty monetary fine and probably some points taken away this week.  Handling pit infractions after the race might really be the better solution anyways, it's always infuriating as a fan to see your favorite driver's race ruined by something out of his control. If they are consistent about doing pit penalties after the race this year, I won't complain.  I'd agree that the style of racing worked well for this track, but it might not translate to other tracks very well.  I'd be ok if this race was the only pack-style race of the season. Unfortunately, to your first point, it probably wont come back if no one shows up.    For the Coyne team, I'm wondering if/when IndyCar should get involved. A crew member being run over on pit road is bad for the whole series. At this point, the Coyne team deserves to be banned from the next race. Tell them to use that time off to practice safer pit stops with their drivers."
INDYCAR,3bjchg,following_eyes,3,Mon Jun 29 19:24:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly, there needs to be some sort of no tolerance policy for hitting crew guys. These cars are still going highway speeds down pit lane.  Running over a air hose and shit like that, I think after race penalties are fine.  Putting a driver a lap down because one of their crew guys let him go too soon and if it doesn't effect the flow of the race, in my opinion it's not a huge offense that should cost you a race.  Obviously no driver is trying to take someone out, but there needs to be a stiff penalty if it does happen. ."
INDYCAR,3bjchg,DisraeliEers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:41:35 2015 UTC,When they had Dracone and Gonzalez I get that they should be reprimanded...but they had Vautier in the car Saturday and he's an experienced enough driver without known for being dangerous so I see that as just a mistake. It sucks that it keeps happening to the Coyne guys but he never ran over his guys at SPM and doesnt do it in sports cars.
INDYCAR,3bjchg,dbroo55,3,Mon Jun 29 19:31:25 2015 UTC,"Well see, the fact that Vautier normally doesn't run over his crew makes me want to reprimand the team even more. Teams should be practicing pit stops with their driver and car to make sure they are done safely.  It seems apparent from the repeated mistakes this year that Coyne doesn't do a lot of pit stop practice with his carousel of drivers. I just think rules should be much harsher for things like striking a crew member, and I think both the driver and the team should be held accountable.   Here's how I think the rule should go: If the team (including the driver) does any action that result in an injury to a team member or official in pit road, that team/driver is docked 25 points.  The team and the driver are both placed on probation for a full calendar year. If a team or driver who is on probation causes another injury on pit road, that team and/or driver is banned from the following race.    Having such a harsh penalty would make sure both the team and the driver are even more careful on pit road.."
INDYCAR,3bjchg,MiniAndretti,2,Mon Jun 29 19:48:55 2015 UTC,"I think I agree with everything except for 4 which I believe we've already discussed to great detail.   But this is a great writeup and I think you bring a great perspective considering you were there and watched the TV broadcast. Lots of excellent points made.  I will say that Power's complaining didn't seem to bother me (probably because I don't really like pack racing), but him pushing the medical staff got me pretty pissed. I understand that he was hot and angry as is normal for race car drivers to get, but that guys just doing his job, which could become saving lives. Hands off, Will."

INDYCAR,3bjchg,jack_rafter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:30:57 2015 UTC,"Regarding Graham not getting a penalty, race control is taking a new perspective this year. It's not enough that there could have been a problem. Air hoses are a perfect example. In the past they penalized every time a driver ran over a hose. This year they are looking at the cause and result. Drivers have run over hoses and not been penalized. Multiple infractions, however, will gain stiffer sanctions. Had Graham's incident happened under green, it would have been different. As it was, Graham gained no advantage (over his previous position) and the race was not effected at that moment. Would penalizing on the spot make it less likely the team would do it again?"

Jimmy Clark won in his 2nd or 3rd try.  Graham Hill won his rookie race.  Grand Prix drivers were still considered the top rung, but Indy had more respect than now.  There was more interchange as well, so you could see how different strengths played out.  AJ Foyt won LeMans in his rookie race.  Mario Andretti won his rookie Daytona 500.

McLaren Honda is the only team that would match engines, but maybe one of the customer teams like FI, Lotus, or Sauber would put aside their loyalties. Indycar is easy to get into, you buy almost every part off the shelf."
INDYCAR,3bjiu1,nalyd8991,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:06:52 2015 UTC,McLaren and Honda blocked him from doing Le Mans so unless a lot of things change it's mostly talk.
INDYCAR,3bjiu1,Mikemat5150,5,Mon Jun 29 23:20:45 2015 UTC,but this could be in a Honda car..
INDYCAR,3bjiu1,hotsizzlepancakes,2,Mon Jun 29 23:46:33 2015 UTC,He also gets paid millions of dollars a year and the risk of injury is high. There is a reason none of the top drivers do anything. Especially after Kubica's crash.
INDYCAR,3bjiu1,Mikemat5150,2,Tue Jun 30 02:52:33 2015 UTC,Imagine the outrage there would have been if Alonso was injured to even a degree that Hinchcliffe was.
INDYCAR,3bkopd,25Tab,3,Tue Jun 30 00:29:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said.  I both agree and disagree with Ed though.  He's correct to a certain extent and has the right to voice his opinion.  A.J. basically said the same thing and no one has brought that up.  I don't however on the other hand think drivers should just not say anything if they feel uneasy about something.  There's a difference between bitching about race control or something and fearing for your life.  Conway has a relationship with Ed and he basically said I'm not racing ovals anymore, so I can totally see where he's coming from"
INDYCAR,3bkopd,no_comment_necessary,3,Tue Jun 30 00:57:39 2015 UTC,I don't think he was saying drivers shouldn't voice concerns. I'm sure he supports that whole heartedly. I just think he took exception to Will Power's over the top comments after the race asking for people to lose jobs and somewhat accusing the series of trying to kill drivers.
INDYCAR,3bkopd,Mouse_for_life,3,Tue Jun 30 01:23:55 2015 UTC,Specifically Ed probably didn't like the part where Power and Cendric said that they went and told indycar and how they ignored them and needs to take responsibility. That probably doesn't show a stable image of the series
INDYCAR,3bkopd,11by3,2,Tue Jun 30 02:45:31 2015 UTC,"It was reported on Friday that drivers told IndyCar this package would produce pack racing. We already knew IndyCar didn't listen, they just said it again."
INDYCAR,3bkopd,11by3,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:51:49 2015 UTC,I guess the question is whether the pack racing we saw on Saturday is something comparable to the pack racing IndyCar has tried to avoid for years.  I think there is a line there between entertaining races and flat out insanity and the series has to figure out where that line falls. I usually defer to the drivers on these issues but it seems not all the drivers agree here.
INDYCAR,3bkopd,neocamel,2,Tue Jun 30 13:36:04 2015 UTC,"What I did not like about it vs. Indy is they could not get away from other cars. So like when Sato had a small wiggle, he was caught between Power coming down a bit and Dixon coming up a bit and that crash happens. Pure racing incident, but since nobody could really even leap frog, they get stuck and it is just a matter of time before an awful wreck. Briscoe is incredibly lucky to walk away after becoming a lawn dart."
INDYCAR,3bkopd,crblack24,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:44:29 2015 UTC,Lol upvoted based on last two words of comment.
INDYCAR,3bkopd,Goober15x70,3,Sun Jul 5 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.  It wasn't Vegas - totally different. Yes, the cars were close, but shouldn't they be? That's what makes it exciting and creates fan interest.  Listen, I don't want to see any of them die or get maimed, but let's not forget why we watch - the amazing skill of these guys - and that was never on better display than this past Saturday. When it's a parade is when people look at oval racing and go, ""well their just driving around in circles.""  Will has every right to bitch and moan, and Ed has every right to call him out for it. This is like when people think that the first amendment gives them the right not to be called stupid for their opinions."
INDYCAR,3bkopd,Goober15x70,-1,Tue Jun 30 13:42:18 2015 UTC,"Ed Carpenter, formerly of Vision Racing (Tony George's team) and Tony George's stepson, sure, his opinion isn't a conflict of interest or anything ;)"
INDYCAR,3bjpik,Mikemat5150,4,Mon Jun 29 19:54:05 2015 UTC,We had reached an agreement on a date and time     Well that's cool!

INDYCAR,3bjpik,treflechanceux,3,Mon Jun 29 21:29:13 2015 UTC,Fucking bring it!  Will allow me to attend 4 races next season.
INDYCAR,3bjpik,MiniAndretti,2,Tue Jun 30 00:37:57 2015 UTC,"I will be excited if this happens, but we've heard this talk before."
INDYCAR,3bjpik,INeedANamePlz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:26:46 2015 UTC,He seems a bit pissed.
INDYCAR,3bjpik,INeedANamePlz,3,Mon Jun 29 21:12:49 2015 UTC,I think it's more a high pressure tactic to get the deal done. They've probably given their price point and are seeing what happens
INDYCAR,3bjpik,ctnaka,3,Mon Jun 29 21:59:05 2015 UTC,I sure hope so. I'd be ecstatic if this happens.
INDYCAR,3bjq92,cajunaggie08,3,Mon Jun 29 19:59:12 2015 UTC,"Well Honda can at least say ""see, told ya it wasn't the engine's fault"""
INDYCAR,3bjq92,InvisibleTeeth,3,Mon Jun 29 20:51:58 2015 UTC,In one series at least
INDYCAR,3bjq92,empw,3,Tue Jun 30 05:59:23 2015 UTC,"The massive draft probably is what brought them up to equal speed with the Chevys.   I don't want to undermine the improvements they've made (especially considering Marco was quick without the draft in qualifying), but I think Milwaukee will be a little more telling."
INDYCAR,3bjq92,-internets,2,Mon Jun 29 22:16:55 2015 UTC,There was a massive draft at Indy. No Honda rose above fifth during green flag racing.
INDYCAR,3bjq92,MiniAndretti,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:27:48 2015 UTC,So I guess the question is then whether or not they've made improvements between Indy and last sunday.
INDYCAR,3bjq92,-internets,4,Mon Jun 29 22:40:20 2015 UTC,"The multitude of aero components I saw during my garage walks leads me to believe they made a bunch of changes from Indy. I don't think I saw one car, Honda or Chevy, with the same exact configuration"
INDYCAR,3bjq92,Mouse_for_life,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:47:39 2015 UTC,Thats cool! That's what I love about the aero kits
INDYCAR,3bjq92,-internets,2,Tue Jun 30 05:00:58 2015 UTC,I know Penske   Will had no winglets Montoya had two winglets Hello had right side winglet Simon had left side winglet
INDYCAR,3bjq92,Mouse_for_life,2,Tue Jun 30 05:04:42 2015 UTC,That's just awesome
INDYCAR,3bjq92,-internets,2,Tue Jun 30 05:06:17 2015 UTC,I'm guessing Honda was competitive due to the style of racing. There was so much drafting going on that the slight areo advantage Chevy has had was nullified. I imagine next week Honda will go back to being out of the main running.
INDYCAR,3bjq92,malowolf,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:44:32 2015 UTC,"I think there are just so many aero options available that it has taken time to find the combinations that work.  We saw cars out there with 1 left rear winglet, both rear winglets, I think I even saw a right only.  Plus each winglet in the front and rear is tunable, along with the actual rear spoiler.  I don't think it was solely the draft....Hondas were able to get out in front and lead.  If it was because of the draft, once they got to the lead they would be swallowed up immediately on the straights.  The competitiveness of both chassis is what I was excited the most about after the race.  I really hope the parity at road courses follow sooner rather than later."
