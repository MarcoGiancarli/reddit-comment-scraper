RATS,3e3x46,SylviaMarsh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:36:19 2015 UTC,"Jacques and Basil came to us as young rats (maybe around 3-4 months old) from our local rescue centre at the end of April. These poor wee guys had been abandoned in a layby over Easter weekend; they were terrified and completely unhandleable, drawing a fair amount of blood any time we tried to feed them or give them treats. It's taken a lot of TLC, patience (and plasters/band aids) to bring them round and help them realise they're now in their ""forever home"".  Jacques is still ill (3 weeks and 3 separate medications haven't shifted the myco), but they're no longer drawing blood from us when we try to fuzzle them. They now come to us for hugs when we open their cage, so they've come on leaps and bounds...literally, as it happens! Basil (our shy laddie) decided that the sleeve of /u/RainyRat's dressing gown was a fun place to explore last night so he leapt up there with gay abandon, giving RainyRat quite a surprise.  Gosh...what a turnaround!"

RATS,3e2l3v,PamelaBeasley,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:31 2015 UTC,"My rats had the same problem (wheezing, red mucus, etc.) when I brought them home from a breeder. I took them to the vet and they were both having a move-induced mycoplasmosis flare-up. It's a common disorder in non-lab bred rats which you may already know. Try taking your rat into the bathroom, let the hot water run and see if the steam helps loosen the mucus. We do this for our girls when their wheezing gets gnarly - which happens from time to time. The steam usually helps quite a bit.    P.S. I got this advice from my vet over a year ago. They have not had to go back to the vet since."
RATS,3e2l3v,CocoaBagelPuffs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:20 2015 UTC,I'll definitely try the shower steam idea! Just need to wait until someone else is home so they can keep an eye on the dogs while I sit in the bathroom with her.
RATS,3e2l3v,devecon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"My rats were super sneezy and wheezy too. Steam works really well. My babies were irritated for about a week and a half after they came home.   It could also be irritation from old bedding. My rats were on CareFresh, which their lungs just didn't agree with.   I've switched them to Kaytee clean and cozy and the sneezing went down."
RATS,3e2l3v,SelfishIdol,2,Tue Jul 21 19:26:01 2015 UTC,"It could be a reaction to the stress of moving and a new environment, but it's always worth taking new rats to the vet for a clean bill of health. If they're pet store rats, they might have a variety of problems like mites and respiratory issues."
RATS,3e2l3v,Zanki,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:10 2015 UTC,"The first week after acquiring pet rats usually is accompanied by some signs of stress.  They have each other, but have usually lost the rest of their companions.  Your routine is vastly different from in the store (even though it's probably better for them - less bright light and obnoxious children).  Their diet may have changed a little or a lot.  The environment: air, scents and sounds has probably changed a great deal as well.  A little porphyrin (red mucus) is okay.  A little sneezing is okay.  It would help to have more specifics.  Duration, how often, intensity."
RATS,3e2u3l,Could_You_Not,4,Tue Jul 21 15:06:42 2015 UTC,Maybe it was human error. Maybe you forgot to correctly latch the cage and they opened it. Ive done the same when i first got my rats. I literally left one of the 3 doors open. I come home from the movies to find my biggest male sleeping in my bed and my baby rat was on my bedroom floor playing in their play boxes. It was terrifying but relieving after i found them. If you dont think it was human error then try putting a clip on the door for extra security?
RATS,3e2u3l,juggernaut_95,2,Tue Jul 21 15:20:06 2015 UTC,You could use a small luggage lock with a key as a safety measure against the door being opened.

RATS,3dxejm,KaytJay,3,Mon Jul 20 22:29:17 2015 UTC,"Here's why they are free roam : Luna, who just passed away, would sit in her cage and rock back and forth chewing on her hand when she was put in the cage. I swear she thought she was human. We got Sprite next who ended up being indifferent to being in the cage. When we got Pepsi, though, she was returned to the store because the snake wasn't hungry. I know that sweet girl was abused and because of that, we didn't have the heart to keep her in a cage. Sprite is her best friend so she's happy. And last, but not least, Anna and Elsa started in a cage - mostly at night - and Anna chewed a freaking bar off the cage so she could wiggle out."
RATS,3dxejm,WheresMyDietDrKelp,9,Tue Jul 21 00:07:04 2015 UTC,They don't really poop down there. But I cut the black fabric off the bottom of the box spring so I just have to take my mattress off and lift up the box spring.

RATS,3dxejm,foxontherox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:04:25 2015 UTC,Mine pee when they wake up and when I put them back in the cage. Having an animal on a schedule you can pretty much predict when they go potty.
RATS,3dxejm,Jadders47,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:59:01 2015 UTC,"Mine are litter trained too, but they still pee a bit outside of their cage. The research I've done shows rats will dribble pee everywhere they go to show their sexual availability, so it's not something you can train them not to do."

RATS,3e1gc7,NOCOOKIEFORYOU2513,4,Tue Jul 21 05:45:22 2015 UTC,You can buy equate infant ibuprofen for really cheap at Walmart ($3?). It comes with a needless syringe which I fill up to the first line and give every 4-6 hours. My rats think it's candy. This works out to a moderate dose for a female rat. Ibuprofen is  hard on their little systems so I would use it sparingly.   Another thing you can buy for very cheap is antibiotic ointment with a topical numbing agent.  This might be a good investment since a big threat with degloving is infection.

I ended up getting him two companions because I couldn't stand to see him so sad (and he's doing just fine now!), so I'd say just keep an eye on her. If she needs a friend, she'll probably let you know. I don't think it'd be bad to rehome her as long as you make the process as easy on her as you can, and the new owners are aware of her age and health."
RATS,3dzin7,mountainmermaid17,2,Mon Jul 20 22:28:27 2015 UTC,"I'd say it depends on your rat. My current little one is a single female. She gets a lot of interaction, is a little over 1.5 years old, and a cheerful girl. If your buddy seems depressed, I'd consider rehoming, but at that age it may be stressful. If she seems happy, shower her with attention and I'd say let her live out her remaining years pampered by the person she knows and loves."
RATS,3dzin7,razzled89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:59:53 2015 UTC,"Several years ago I was in the same situation. My rat grieved for several weeks, exhibiting lower appetite and energy, but she did come out of it eventually. Similarly to your girl, she loved interacting with humans and being carried around so I decided that it was better to keep her alone for her remaining life. It turned out ok. Rehoming will be disruptive, particularly at her age, and she'll miss you as much as her cagemate. I'd suggest waiting a few weeks and watching her behaviour."

Some people don't understand that rodents aren't just super cuddly, passive snake foods that are going to sit and wait to be eaten and that they are actually predators too. Frozen/thawed prey is really offered more for the safety of a pet snake than anything else. It's also way more humane. That being said, this guy is waaayy too cute to be snake food, and he has a fantastic name now! Hopefully, you can get him socialized and undo all that past trauma :)"

RATS,3dznz0,TehDebil,4,Mon Jul 20 20:50:33 2015 UTC,"Nilla's outgoing nature was bolstered by her cagemates in the store, and perhaps a desire to get away from them.  Now that she's on her own, she's gotta look out for number one.  Don't be too disheartened that she's not the brave girl she appeared to be.  Trust training, especially with store rats, and especially with lone rats, can take months.  This is okay.  My story: I got Kitty because she was the outgoing rat in the store, and Mino because she was super pretty.  Kitty instantly became a timid rat at home, whereas Mino was brave!  I've had my girls for almost three months now, and my girls aren't fond of being picked up or petted, but every day we work on it, and every day is better!  Introductions: I would say that if introductions take a week or two, that's fine.  If they take longer ... that's also fine!  Continue just the way you are.  Neutral scent and territory for as long as your girls will stand it, at the same time every day, and then back to their respective homes.  Keep the cages close, but outside arms length during the night.  Eventually, you will be able to cohabit them in a (superclean - remove all wooden/rope/cloth items and scrub it down) cage.  Eventually they will be inseparable.  And when they are cohabiting, then you can expect Nilla to open up again, bolstered by Arya's trust in you."
RATS,3dznz0,SelfishIdol,2,Mon Jul 20 22:30:23 2015 UTC,"'Power-grooming' this is the first time I've heard of this, but this PERFECTLY describes how rats handle their cage mates haha! I will say, give Nilla awhile to really open up. I bought Whiskey and for the first few weeks she was timid, barely came out of her house, wouldn't let me pick her up; now she hops all over me and is the first out of the cage to explore. I'm sure once Nilla and Arya are housed together, Nilla will relax and become more friendly and more of the rat you saw in the pet shop. I think you're doing a great job now, by sort of 'forcing' her to trust you, to show her you're not big and scary.  If the two are getting along and there aren't any fights, I would think about housing them soon. I feel anything longer than a month would be too long."

RATS,3e0hhq,chinese-takeout,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:18:57 2015 UTC,Dry skin can also be caused by too much protein in a rat's diet.  But rule out mites first (maybe with your vet) before making any diet changes.

At the time it was amazing though - and we didn't just have the rats. My GF and I had two 4 year old sons (one each from previous marriages), a nine-year old Malamute named Keiko who was the master rat guardian, a surly tom-cat, a duck named Ferdinand, a raccoon named Jezebel, and a variety of white's tree frogs.

She literally has let them become an obsessive behaviour.  What do you mean not compatible? It's not like he hates the rats with all his passion. she's had them since she was sixteen and he married her after all. It's that she's letting rats take over her life and she doesn't even consult him before buying even more rats.  You make it sound like it's all the husband's fault he or she moved out (I can't remember which), but honestly, this marital friction is definitely on her and her obsession.

It comes off to me the same as any guy (or women I'm sure) consider whatever hobby, or lifestyle their partner has to be childish or something they'll get over because they don't share their interest.

It usually occurs at 'puberty' but hormonal changes are possible at any point in life, at a much lower frequency.  Either Sergei has spiked, or possibly Nibbler's has decreased, or maybe he's been faking it all along and Sergei sees an opportunity to be the big man in the cage.  The why is usually not too important (though, if your boys are approaching their annual vet checkup, it would be a good idea to mention the behaviour change).  Practically, until there is blood drawn, there's not a lot you should do to intervene.  They may re-sort themselves hierarchically.  Nibbler is not a bad alpha, they are just re-examining their relationship.  Examine them for additional damage, and you may want to consider neutering if the fights continue to be blood-curdling, or develop into blood-letting."

The rats aren't getting any younger and I think they have the best chance of bonding the younger they are. And Sammy is growing up SO fast. And new girl is already a lot bigger than Sam!   I've also bought pet rats from my small-town pet store guy a few times over the last couple of decades and they were all healthy. And everything I've read seems to indicate that a wild baby is probably a pretty low risk of carrying, though an adult wild rat would be a much riskier prospect. So it was a somewhat calculated risk. I've already got an appointment with my vet for tomorrow morning for an unrelated issue... (my idiot cat seems to have injured his tail)... So I'm going to chat up the vet tomorrow and see what I can do on that front. The other down side of small town living is that it is nearly impossible to find a vet that will treat any animal that isn't cat, dog, or cattle.

The two bonded like litter mates and are still good buddies 5 years later. If a dog and a cat can be BFFs if introduced as babies why not two different flavors of rat?  So far, so good.

RATS,3dvrw8,SelfishIdol,3,Mon Jul 20 15:25:43 2015 UTC,"You've probably made the right choice by picking up a girl - roof and pet rats rarely rarely breed successfully (if Sam is indeed a male).  Female rats are promiscuous, so again, if they try, she may become pregnant with a fail-litter.  It may be worth spaying her if Sam turns out to be a male."
RATS,3dvrw8,MsRenee,2,Mon Jul 20 15:28:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm sincerely hoping there are no rat testicles in my future. It will probably be quite a pilgrimage to get to any vet that would be willing to spay or neuter a rat since I live in a pretty small town. But we'll cross that road if/when we come to it. I've traveled further for less compelling reasons. I just want Sam and his (her?) new buddy to have happy, fulfilling lives."

RATS,3dvsn4,Natrix03,4,Sun Jul 19 23:09:40 2015 UTC,"She will do everything needed to raise the babies up until separation of sexes @ 5 weeks.  Your girl should have 12 nipples and some babies will have to be cycled around, but don't worry, MOM knows what to do and they should be OK.  You can interact with them regularly, talk to them and let them smell you, to get them used to you and become more social and such.  Our babies are about 12 days old, eyes opened, ears open and got their hair and I handle them daily and such and the momma rat does not mind much, in fact she looks at me with this ""Thank you I needed a break"" look.."
RATS,3dvsn4,Elfnet_Gaming,2,Mon Jul 20 04:53:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for commenting :). the mom has already asked for a few breaks haha, but all seem well fed and happy! we can tell she's asking for a break because she comes to the top and when we open it she tries to scramble out.   She lunged at us twice (scraping us and making us bleed) once before and once directly after the birth but now she seems actually way happier and better already and when one of her bubs was too far away when we picked it up she just came over and took it from our fingers when we had it outstretched. I'm not sure if she just trusts us more or is too tired to care haha.  do you know if 15 is a big litter or normal? just curious I'm assuming its a big litter."
RATS,3dvsn4,SelfishIdol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:04:48 2015 UTC,"I have different sources saying average litter size is:   4-8 6-13 10-12 6-23 6-14 (ratbehavior.org, which I put a lot of trust in)   Probably safe to say you have a fairly large litter (thankfully not 24 though, eh?)!"
RATS,3dvsn4,Elfnet_Gaming,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah they get defensive sometime right before birth and after but it they totally trust you the may not mind you touching them or their babies right away.  The one here she let me rub her head while she was birthing lol. IDK it seemed to make he feel more comfortable and secure though I think thats rare.. She also let me touch the babies a few day after to inspect and to try to determine sex and such. I didn't want to mess with them right away.   Now she and her babies are back in the big CN cage with the other girls and it's quite funny. The momma rat is ALWAYS chasing down escaped babies and carrying them back to the castle. She really likes it when its ""Break time"" lol.  15 is pretty sizable. They can have anywhere from 1 to 20 though.  I think I got lucky with mine only having 4, I pretty much already have good homes for them already too.  I think my Nibbles is pregnant too, thing is I don't know how or when it could have happened though, time will tell though.."

The Rat Highrise (H-600HR) 18"" x 11"" x 24"" Three ramps, Two balconies, Full middle floor, Drop-in 3"" plastic pan, Power coated  We lost our two babies a few months ago and really want to give this cage away to someone who will appreciate it. The cage itself was a 100 dollars.   Accessories include a wheel, a plastic igloo, 2 water bottles, a traveling case, half a bag of paper bedding, half a bag of regal rat food, food bowl, and various toys and treats.  We live in Paw Paw, MI and are willing to drive an hour.

RATS,3duocx,whispered195,3,Sun Jul 19 18:36:40 2015 UTC,"I would but breaking it down for shipping would be a nightmare and shipping it this way, would cost almost as much as the cage itself. The Martin cages come partially assembled and you have to crimp on metal rings to finish the build. I don't remember off the top of my head but there are A LOT of rings so breaking it down just isnt an option. Check out the free or barter section on Craigslist. There are usually tons of cages on there just make sure you clean and sanitize it with something rat safe before letting the little rattie in there!"
RATS,3dtjrd,Djammer,8,Sun Jul 19 08:58:02 2015 UTC,Just a reminder that balls aren't recommended for rats. Bad for their backs and they don't get enough stimulation. They do make great beds though! That one looks so cosy.

RATS,3dw401,_31415_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:03:39 2015 UTC,"I went to a home improvement store and picked up a couple of tiles to put in the cage, as they're a bit better at dissipating heat than the plastic that's currently lining it. I've been swapping them back and forth, so there's always one in the fridge cooling down, and one in the cage for them to lie on.      They seem to dislike it when it's fresh out of the fridge, but after a few minutes they plop down and brux a bunch."

Alot of things I've read suggest putting I'm cages near each other so they smell each other first and then introducing them in a neutral space.   http://www.ratfanclub.org/newrat.html This explains it well.  I had two that got along most of the time but would occasionally fight, Like 3 times a month, nothing too aggressive more playing but it would sound bad because one would squeak all the time."
RATS,3dvi7y,BurrritoPrincess,4,Sun Jul 19 21:40:55 2015 UTC,"When you separated your rats, you took away their best sense of security, each other. Feeling secure is one of the most important things that convinces rats toget their brave on and begin to make friends with scary human beings.  I realize that at this point, the change has been made, and there's. No going backuntil the end of summer break. Be heartened that there's no time limit within which to complete trust training. Trust training, even with paired rats, can take months. Don't. Be disheartened if a week doesn't cut it. What you're tryong to do is override a really strong prey instinct. Be patient, be consistent, and give ypur rat everytging she needs to feel safe.  This means: lots of places to hide (from you ), limitations on your invasiveness (don't pull shelters off her, or chase her around her cage) and i recommend getting her a buddy, if you can. When you have playtime, open the cage door, don't compell her to come out, and talk to her. If you feed her some snacks and she never comes out, that's okay. When my girls are skittish, i read to them, because i just don't have an hour of chatting in me.  And eemember, it will take time,and that's okay.  Best of luck!"
RATS,3dvi7y,SelfishIdol,3,Mon Jul 20 00:25:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, to all of that!   Definitely get her a companion. Even though she's only separated from your roommate's rat for three months, she could very well be lonely and depressed. Getting a buddy will help with her sense of security and boost her confidence because she won't be alone. Also, if she watches you handling/picking up the other rat, she will probably realize pretty quickly that you aren't trying to hurt her in any way (I'm convinced this happened with one of my previously very skittish rats; they are extremely smart animals!)."
RATS,3dvi7y,baldpeanut,3,Mon Jul 20 03:48:25 2015 UTC,"I'll have to look into getting her a buddy, considering I might not be living with my roommate after this year. Thanks for the help!!"
RATS,3dvi7y,casiokitten,2,Mon Jul 20 13:14:05 2015 UTC,I'm glad to know that I can gain her trust anytime. I was afraid she might get too old and that there was no turning back at that point. Thank you for all the advice! I'll start being less invasive in her personal space from now on!!
RATS,3dupyi,facesofbeth,4,Sun Jul 19 17:41:43 2015 UTC,I'm having similar issues with one of my pairs of rats. They use the litter box to eat/store their food. But not to crap in.. No matter how diligent I can be with a 35 hour a week job.   I found if I got the litter boxes with the grate helped at least keep the food from touching the dirtied litter and might help you at least keep the litter in the tray and maybe dissuade him.   I'm thinking ones like this: http://m.petsmart.ca/h5/hub?id=supplies%2Flitter-pans%2Fall-living-things-scatterless-small-animal-litter-pan-zid36-14347%2Fcat-36-catid-600100%3Fvar_id%3D36-14347  You could see my trouble maker in the litter box eating but he's not in the litter.  http://i.imgur.com/iSXdbbK.jpg
RATS,3dupyi,Ichbinskyr,3,Sun Jul 19 18:12:58 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad you've come over to the fleece side!  I think what you have is exactly a matter of time.  One of my rats picked up on the litter training over the course of days ... the other one took weeks to figure it out.  It definitely helps when one rat is behaving as desired (they are so good now!).  Make sure you don't overclean the litter, err on the side of too dirty over too clean (if it is more dirty than you like, you can wipe your rat's feet and belly with a clean wet cloth when he comes out to play)."
RATS,3dupyi,SelfishIdol,3,Sun Jul 19 18:15:50 2015 UTC,I haven't even cleaned the litter since I switched to fleece. I even throw shit in there while my rat is sleeping. He sleeps face down in his own shit and he smells like shit.  I'm wondering if this will eventually change and why he is possibly so territorial towards his precious pan.
RATS,3dupyi,SelfishIdol,2,Sun Jul 19 18:58:06 2015 UTC,I would be frustrated too!  What is the rest of his cage like?  Where does the other rat sleep?
RATS,3dupyi,SelfishIdol,2,Sun Jul 19 20:17:53 2015 UTC,"I have hammocks, a space pod, and a castle. Other rat lounges/sleeps in those and is disinterested in the litter box."
RATS,3dupyi,SelfishIdol,2,Sun Jul 19 23:37:15 2015 UTC,"Is the litter pan the darkest corner of your cage?  That's why another redditor's rat was sleeping there.  You may want to consider tossing some small, dark boxes in to provide competitive hiding spots."

No matter how much time you spend with him, you really can't replace having another rat to groom, snuggle, and play with.  On a related note, is Shamus's cage a glass tank? If so, you should replace it with a wire cage. Rats are very sensitive to heat and odour, and both build up very fast in a tank even if the lid provides ventilation.
