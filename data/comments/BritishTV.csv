While humorous, it does give a lot of information in a short clip.  It takes slick timing and practice to make something like that seem effortless.

The cruelty and coldness were at times quite hard to watch, and the trapped, claustrophobic tone were almost overpowering, but the ending made for such a fantastic payoff.

After Ozzy was on this show everyone was pissing themselves with laughter and refering it and a lot of high school friends started listening to Black Sabbath, and it definatly raised Ozzy profile in the UK as he hadnt been on many TV before then for a few years, and it was the hillarious mix of hard rock/drugs stories with family life which clearly got the TV execs at MTV interested."

Some of them were simple and sweet, like when the ghost of a kid who died decades ago led Marshall to a love letter, that he has to deliver to the now-elderly recipient.  Others were just fill-tilt gonzo.  I loved the one where the kid got the retainer that allowed him to hear what dogs were thinking - and they were planning a revolution.  That one ended with the old ""and he was never seen again,"" and I remember thinking, wait, does that mean a bunch of dogs killed a 13 year old?    I've caught a few of them over the years, and while the effects are definitely early-90s quality, it's still pretty clever."

BritishTV,3coyav,Gwendalenia,25,Thu Jul 9 16:35:48 2015 UTC,"Traditionally yes, although the boundaries have blurred a lot since the channels were originally created.  Basically, BBC1's remit is to have as broad an appeal as possible. If BBC Radio 1 plays pop music, BBC 1 the channel plays pop TV.  Programmes on BBC1 are generally more family-friendly. It offers lots of different types of programmes.  BBC2 is traditionally where things go if they don't quite fit into that format. Perhaps they're more niche documentaries, or bluer comedies. It's for more mature audiences in general (not in the sense that it shows age-restricted content, just mainly appeals to adults). If something merits being broadcast but won't get good ratings, it usually goes to BBC2.  BBC 3 is for younger audiences. Especially teenagers and people in their 20s, with Family Guy and Russell Howard being things that come to mind. It's always strongly supported arts and comedy in the UK. But it's expensive to run, so it's getting axed.  BBC Four (TV and Radio) aims at the upper-middle classes and its peripheries. A lot of higher-brow programming which would never make a profit. Period dramas, politics, science, etc.  As I said, the distinction is blurry; programmes can and do move around. A recent example is a high-brow quiz show called Only Connect. It's pretty challenging and wasn't considered pop enough to make it into BBC 1 or 2. But, since ratings were unusually high, it's since been moved to BBC 2.  And, as other commenters have said now, the BBC isn't the only UK broadcasting company, at all."
BritishTV,3coyav,Joe64x,15,Thu Jul 9 16:47:06 2015 UTC,"Wait a second....I'm working class (born and bred in a shit, poor town in the Midlands) yet I love BBC Four's programming more than the other BBC channels. I'm one episode into a fascinating doc detailing the history of Rome, from its origins worshipping Pagan gods to its current status as a beacon of Roman Catholicism. I loved last night's shows about filming live giant squid and the birth, life and death cycle of stars.  I'd equate BBC Four as being the corporation's equivalent to the channels on the Documentaries section of digital TV (History Channel, Discovery, etc) but without having to pay extra."
BritishTV,3coyav,chaoticmessiah,13,Thu Jul 9 18:28:26 2015 UTC,BBC 4 is wonderful.
BritishTV,3coyav,NikkiJayne28,8,Thu Jul 9 19:14:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's more accurate to say that BBC 4, like Radio 4, is aimed at the intellectually curious.  People who like to learn about things.    Though those who come from working-class backgrounds may have had worse and shorter traditional education than upper-class people, class doesn't necessarily translate into whether a person is intellectually curious about the world.  [What I do believe though, is that trash TV does slowly turn the audience into fools.]  I don't know about the quality of History Channel and Discovery Channel documentaries that are aired in the UK, but in the US there is a huge difference between documentaries on PBS [Nature, Nova, Frontline] and those on commercial/cable channels.  PBS is closer to quality UK productions, commercial channel documentaries tend to be sensationalist and trashy fluffing up 5 minutes of fact with lurid graphics, hyperbole and speculation and interrupted by irrelevant commercials.  They teach you almost nothing.  I've also seen some trashy UK documentaries but they weren't on BBC 4"
BritishTV,3coyav,notanimalnotmineral,2,Thu Jul 9 21:46:06 2015 UTC,"Plot twist: many of the documentaries aired on PBS are BBC documentaries rebranded. Some National Geographic docs have also been produced or done in partnership with the BBC.   tl;dr The BBC rules the shit when it comes to quality documentaries. They do their own, share it worldwide and then help others, too."
BritishTV,3coyav,ads8888,2,Fri Jul 10 02:43:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with your assessment of PBS versus History and Discovery  Channel.  When I want to know what is happening in the world,  I watch BBC news on PBS.  And there is a HUGE difference on how BBC and US news tell stories.   US is hyped up,  biased,  and focused towards the market of the station not focused t towards educating and informing the masses anymore. Also,  BBC news videos show shit happening in action.  US news shows the after effect.   History and Discovery shows is borderline between entertainment and information."

That's not the reason it was singled out for the axe. It's not that expensive to run, the 'digital' channels (as they were before everything was digital) such as BBC3 and 4 all have tiny budgets compared with BBC1 and 2.   The money saved on its programmes is going to both it's online replacement and BBC1. The actual outputting of the channel will save virtually nothing - most of it is done by a privatised BBC department  owned by Ericcson.  It's just the one that will cause the least fuss as only kids watch it and the one that will work best online..... although it won't, no-one will watch it"

ABC, CBS, NBC , and you can count Fox...I guess.   Fox started out as only a syndication service in the 80s but took on originally programs. Married with Children was its first non syndicated show,then the Simpsons grew up from a short on Tracy Ullman show into its own show in 1989 and matured into the 25yr old it is now. Sadly 9\11 gave birth to the news abomination that is now Fox News."

The BBC is our public service broadcaster. We also have ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5. Then there's Sky TV and all the other satellite/cable channels (although these are mainly worldwide).  What the previous respondent said is true - the BBC's programming is channel specific (i.e. BBC 4 is where you'll find the arts). But not exclusively so. (A show can move to 1 or 2 after gaining viewers on 3 or 4).  ITV and Channel 4 etc. do have multiple channels but these are mostly catch-up or repeats. Not always though."

BritishTV,3coyav,zeph1rus,9,Sat Jul 11 21:03:03 2015 UTC,"You are wrong, the BBC is the only network funded by licence payers - it is illegal to watch a TV if that household doesn't have a licence, this costs a little over Â£100 a year.  Other networks are funded by advertisements, but you still need a licence to watch them.  BBC channels aren't ranked, the numbers are simply labels. BBC1 broadcasts news, politics shows, serious dramas and documentaries; 2 is more lighthearted, with sitcoms, comedies, light-hearted drama; 3 is mostly comedy aimed at young adults, but also documentaries and politics shows for a younger demographic, it only airs after 7pm, and is switching to online only soon; 4 is cultural documentaries and films. There is also a 24 hour news channel, and a channel which just shows what's happening in Parliament.  The ITV network has 4 channels, although you could easily argue that they are ranked, since 1 shows the news and general entertainment, 2 shows mostly repeats or less popular shows, 3 and 4 mostly either show really old stuff, or reality TV.  The Channel 4 network has their main channel, which shows news, dramas and comedy - it's also been the home of Paralympics for years, they're quite progressive compared to other networks in terms of content. They also have Film4, which shows a lot of great films (and funds a fair few), E4 which shows a lot of American sitcoms, More4 which shows the lesser/older shows, and 4Seven which just repeats prime time TV all day.  Those are the main three, especially if you don't have satellite/cable, there are plenty more though."

It's been over Â£100 since 1999.  edit: also it's not illegal to ""watch a TV"", just illegal to watch live TV as it's broadcast, or live TV that's been timeshifted or recorded.  Use it for consoles, netflix, bluray, iplayer catch-up (for now), etc and it's perfectly legal to not have a license."

The limiting factor is bandwidth - NHK and BBC could use high-speed academic networks because it was research, but Super Hi-Vision requires 20Gbit/s per channel compressed, 144 Gbit/s uncompressed.

BritishTV,3cjhys,mishagale,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:46:13 2015 UTC,Is the point not that trying to solve the problem in other ways is really hard.  There are lots of people and groups trying to achieve exactly what you suggest and it turns out its a pretty hard.    The cabals solution would bypass most of the problems humans have with co-operation and making positive changes in the world.  They also believed timing was critical and if their plan had worked it's difficult to see how any other method could of achieved the same result in the same time frame.    I don't really see a problem with their plan if you take the fact they are already convinced any other method won't solve the problem in time to prevent the global disaster they were trying to avoid.   You have to basically accept the cabal members are true believers in their solution being the only one and they believe they have the data to back that up.   It's been a while since I watched it but am sure some of the good guys question if there were not other ways to achieve change and they got rebuffed saying nothing else would be quick enough.
BritishTV,3cjhys,dvb70,2,Wed Jul 8 16:25:15 2015 UTC,"My friend and I would argue about this so much.  If they have the power and influence to distribute this stuff to literally everyone, why can't they make the world a better place instead of just pushing the reset button on humanity. There will still be war, there will still be suffering, they aren't going change the human psyche of preservation by any means"
BritishTV,3cjhys,boxsteam,2,Wed Jul 8 17:21:52 2015 UTC,It's a virus though.  If you accept that in the premise of the show they have virus capable of achieving what they want to achieve that would be a lot easier to spread then getting the level of global cooperation they would require to do what they want very humanitarian projects.
BritishTV,3cjhys,dvb70,2,Wed Jul 8 21:38:24 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong, it would be easier. I still stand by my comment because you'd need a shit ton of power and influence to let this virus loose. Plus I still think we'd essentially go back to the stone age without learning anything new for the next population boom. I much prefer this kind of debate, rather than the 'evil is real' guy in the thread."
BritishTV,3cjhys,boxsteam,2,Thu Jul 9 09:57:51 2015 UTC,There were certainly a few questions about just what would happen if the plan succeeded.  Its tricky to see how society could stay at the same level of technology if the population reduced by 90%.  I guess as it was something that was going to take quite a bit of time once everyone realised what was happening some effort could be put into trying to concentrate the remaining population together and have them maintain the same technological level.
BritishTV,3cjhys,dvb70,0,Thu Jul 9 10:53:16 2015 UTC,"Because evil exists. It's a real thing. It the hardest lesson in life, that good can't exist without evil. We live in a dualistic universe.  Hence there are people who just do seriously fucked up shit. You want to see ? Just see some posts on WTF and watchpeople die. Watch someone blow someone's brains out and point blank range.

BritishTV,3cjhys,flexiverse,2,Wed Jul 8 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"what people consider 'evil' is relative, that's a fundamental part of the series. I'm not saying the many fucked up things you spouted are good in any way, but you sound like a teenage bible basher. Or at least Mermaid Man from Spongebob. Stop watching so much live leak."
BritishTV,3cjhys,boxsteam,2,Wed Jul 8 21:12:39 2015 UTC,"To me it was pretty fundamental to the series that the bad guys thought they were ultimately going to prevent a great deal of human suffering.  They were prepared to do nasty things to a limited number of people in order to save a vastly greater number of people suffering a great deal.    It's the old question of would you kill 10 people to save a 1,000.  It's a matter of just how many questionable things can you do in the name of a greater good and where is the line of what we would accept in the name of the greater good."
BritishTV,3cjhys,dvb70,2,Wed Jul 8 21:30:09 2015 UTC,"I can see why they would want it, I just don't think we should give up on humanity in 2015. Maybe in a few years. I just think we should plunge resources into science and understanding what to do next. It's a great series and it sparks great debate."
BritishTV,3cjhys,boxsteam,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:44:15 2015 UTC,I think as the series presented it they are almost already too late even if their plans to release the virus went perfectly.  So for the bad guys there was no delaying any further.  Of course if we really face the same issue in the real world is another question and if we do we will undoubtedly go the route you suggest.  Of course if the series prediction turns out to be correct we may be too late but humanity is often at it's best when it's up against something that really has to be done.  Witness technological progress during war times for instance.
BritishTV,3cjhys,dvb70,0,Thu Jul 9 10:48:31 2015 UTC,"What are you fucking mentally insane ? Do you think live leak is some fucking fake fictional channel ?

BritishTV,3cb7ul,PanningForSalt,8,Mon Jul 6 20:34:34 2015 UTC,"Doesn't that channel cost like Â£10000 per viewer per year?    For the amount of people who can speak and understand fluent Welsh they get an awful lot of funding and dedicated programming.  I think Alba (the Scottish channel) is an order of magnitude better value at Â£1000 a year per viewer. Which still means it's massively subsidized and is removing funding from other channels. But at least it's in English, so it's got that going for it."
BritishTV,3cb7ul,DEADB33F,3,Tue Jul 7 00:14:16 2015 UTC,"BBC Alba is in Gaelic and it's programs are definitely not on par with that of S4C. Both have subtitles in English, so anyone can watch them.  I do agree that S4C is somewhat expensive though. However, I don't see anything wrong with these channels being funded. It's nice to have these channels."
BritishTV,3cb7ul,PanningForSalt,4,Tue Jul 7 00:41:25 2015 UTC,"I like having them too. But if reduced funding means that the main BBC outlets see a reduction in quality, then perhaps they should be cut. In the grand scheme of BBC's budget it probably wouldn't make much difference at all though.  In fact, I just googled: S4C costs the BBC Â£76million a year. BBC budget is Â£5billion. It isn't a small amount for sure, but BBC1 costs Â£1.1billion for example, but it is more than BBC3 or BBC4. I don't know what to make of all of this data."

What you end up with is a BBC without the commercially successful shows like Top Gear and so on helping to subsidise the production of the stuff that satisfies the public service obligations.  The commercially successful stuff is sold abroad with advertising (on BBC America, and in other markets like Australia) and that money is funnelled back into the BBC and funds the other stuff too. All the Americans going gooey over Benedict Cumbersnatch in Sherlock are helping contribute to BBC funds which helps the BBC fund all the commercially unsuccessful stuff.  That kind of model can work without any public service requirementâlook at Sky: they make all their money from sport, big entertainment, and bundling together broadband and all that. And they funnel some tiny proportion of that into worthy stuff like Sky Arts. But that proportion is a lot lower than with the BBC, and it is much more expensive to access than BBC content (license fee is about Â£8 a month, Sky starts at Â£20-Â£30 a month without sport)."

Even if they made it so that if you enter your license number you can watch, but if you don't, you get adverts. That'd allow people here to view without ads, and earn them ad revenue from those watching from overseas via VPNs etc."
BritishTV,3ceh0p,WG47,5,Tue Jul 7 19:37:26 2015 UTC,Yes. I don't have s telly or an arial port. Netflix for life. I miss some bbc programmes but the endless adverts on other channels drive me nuts. I'd rather pay and have no adverts.
BritishTV,3ceh0p,Blossomkill,5,Tue Jul 7 09:48:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. Of course.  Why would anybody schedule their life around sitting in front of a screen at some particular time to watch a programme, when they can watch it whenever the hell they feel like? Live broadcast TV is an inferior product to the output of the catchup service."
BritishTV,3ceh0p,AimHere,3,Tue Jul 7 21:47:37 2015 UTC,"Found this topic very odd, the only thing connected to my TV is a chromecast and in response to one of your comments, I certainly don't watch the news. Seems like a very outdated medium of receiving information when I can quickly scan a news website and decide what I want to read about.  I don't really understand why anyone does watch live TV. I've been at friends houses where they will put the TV on and it always results in a comment about how there's nothing worth watching on, plus there's adverts on most channels, plus unless you turn the TV on the hour or half hour you come into a show halfway through.   Also, I do pay the license fee because I can't be bothered with people coming to my house and me trying to convince them that I don't watch live TV."
BritishTV,3ceh0p,Chiasek,3,Tue Jul 7 20:52:29 2015 UTC,One of the biggest worldwide events is the football World Cup. How many people watch it live compared to how many people will bother to watch it later on catch up services?   I agree that there's no reason why you would have to watch Eastenders at 7.30 when you could watch it whenever you've finished putting the kids to bed.
BritishTV,3ceh0p,puttie,3,Tue Jul 7 23:12:19 2015 UTC,"The aerial in my flat doesn't work so I can't watch live TV over the air. I have an XBox One plugged into the TV with the iPlayer app installed, but this doesn't have the live streaming feature. So I pretty much can't watch live TV, and have adapted to not doing so.  So to answer your question: I don't care if you believe me or not. Call me a liar, whatever. The rules are clear: if I don't watch live TV as it is being broadcast, I don't have to have a television licence."
BritishTV,3ceh0p,P-Nuts,2,Tue Jul 7 23:07:29 2015 UTC,My Freesat PVR records more telly than I have the time to watch.  I sometimes use iPlayer for the things it misses.  If I were dead set on getting out of the license fee I could fairly easily give up the PVR because I hardly ever watch anything live.  I listen to the radio for news (and read the Economist).  Ironically I tend to use the podcast version of The World Tonight rather that listen live.
BritishTV,3ceh0p,StayBeautiful_,2,Tue Jul 7 23:18:55 2015 UTC,"The only time I ever watch live tv is if I'm at my boyfriend's. Otherwise I just watch stuff on bbc iplayer, netflix and 4OD."

For everything else, there's Mastercard I watch on websites, especially if said episode isn't coming to the UK for a few weeks/months/ever.  Saying that, I don't see why anyone wouldn't pay the license fee. How else will we pay the BBC to make stuff for us to watch?"

In the end I couldn't actually finish it; found it far too clumsy and emotionally manipulative. I don't really mind the latter, but I need it done with a bit more class - simply showing cutaways to people having fun in the past doesn't cut it. Were they teasing us with a bit of ""perhaps she is faking her death"" a la 9/11? If so, it was done pretty badly and with no payoff. The kid saying ""I think the bombers are bad people"" made me facepalm pretty bad as well. Always like to see Emily Watson, but this was a poor vehicle for her. 3/10."

It's always cunts. It's like they're trying to make you want the wedding to be a disaster.   Edit cause I feel like ranting: And it's so fucking sexist. It's always a perfect little snowflake who deserves to have everything on her special day who's marrying a moronic man-child who couldn't possibly stop being selfish and get his shit together for just one day because he's such a fucking moron. If you gave him the money he'd just spend it on beer, strippers and a holiday in Ibiza for his equally retarded mates.   The worst ones are the bridesmaids. I'm sure the producers tell them to act like snotty little bitches and to moan at every little thing just to make the bloke look like even more of a tosser.

That's where you'll find the most mainstream populist stuff like x factor, Britain's got talent etc. Also renowned for their shite football coverage. Only the beeb is funded by the licence payer.  I should add that bbc1 and itv1 get by far the biggest viewing figures, so really it's a big 2 rather than the big 4 you mention. The only reason I mention 4 is that those were traditionally the only channels you would get for free over an analogue signal. Analogue is no longer active, so everyone gets digital TV with around 30 channels for free (I think), those 4 are still the biggest 4 channels though."

They have a special significance to most in the UK because these were the analogue channels and for a time the time these were the only ones that everyone was guaranteed to get. Although there's lots of choice now, these are still the 'main' channels.    The rest of the channels are seen as lesser channels in many respects. Take a look at the TV guide most people use.

BritishTV,3c1xb1,SuperFLEB,10,Sat Jul 4 00:32:35 2015 UTC,"The Thick of It is the greatest thing ever!  Watch that asap.  I also love Alan Partridge, but it doesn't translate quite as well (it is more British). Try the movie first, which is a silly delight.  I feel like Americans can't do that kind of comedy today, at least in movies.  If you want to go old school and watch ""THE best spy series in television history,"" according to the NY Times, it is all about The Sandbaggers and the cold war.  You probably need to like espionage, hopefully Le Carre, etc., but this show was the best thing ever (approx 1978-80).  And it was terminated because its real spy creator disappeared in a plane under mysterious circumstances.  I'm not kidding.  And, the work he did is still not declassified even though normally it would be just because of the amount of time that has past.  Best Show!! http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/arts/television-spies-who-were-cool-and-very-very-cold.html  I also like Spooks (MI-5) a lot.  It is like a better 24 but be sure to get the full 60 minute versions.  Netflix, a while back at least, had edited versions to fit US commercials for the first seasons.  That is fine to try out the show, but if you like it, be sure to find the 60 minute versions.    I had high hopes for Peaky Blinders, but I just didn't think it lived up to them."
BritishTV,3c1xb1,didyouwoof,7,Sat Jul 4 02:32:33 2015 UTC,"The Sandbaggers is absolutely worth a try. It is very good.  If you're going to do old series, definitely also do The Prisoner. It's another spy series, but very different. The main character is a retired spy, who is held captive in The Village. This village is a Truman Show like horror, where retired spies from all over the world are held. Patrick McGoohan plays the main character, and he is (as always) intense.  Fun fact: he did in fact play a spy in another show before he became the prisoner. He was John Drake in Danger Man (Secret Agent Man in the US). Also a very good show."

BritishTV,3c1xb1,tommorris,14,Sat Jul 4 15:43:22 2015 UTC,"Well, as an American who watches a lot of British TV (I'm a cordcutter, it's unblocked in the US on YouTube-- match made in heaven), here's my usual roster.  Caveats:   These aren't suggestions. I'm terrible with suggestions, and that's too much pressure. This is just a brain dump of what I watch. Listed in the order that I thought of listing them. There's a fair bit of older stuff here, since it's easier to come by, and I tend to find someone I like and dig into their past shows. YouTube links were mostly done by searching it and a quick look-see-click. I don't think there're any deceptive bait links (y'know, the kind that say ""Episode of show"", but are actually a video trying to link you to a sketchy video-download site), but don't quote me on that. Links work in the US. I use YouTube, Hulu+, and Netflix-- shows might be available elsewhere, but I wouldn't know.     So, the shows I watch...   I'm a big Charlie Brooker fan. In the past few years, he's done a number of (mostly similar) shows where he cynically talks about the mass-media. Think Talk Soup, only grumpier. If you're into sarcasm, there're few out there that do it better.   I'd first caught wind of his work when someone linked to How TV Ruined Your Life YouTube. Some people say it's not Brooker's best work, but I still call it my personal favorite (I'm probably a bit biased since that was the first I'd seen, and I'll admit Screenwipe was probably objectively better). If you find that you like that, also try Screenwipe YouTube. It's a bit dated, but still has some funny and interesting insight into TV production. For something more current, watch for Weekly Wipe YouTube. It's the same format as the previous ones, but it's recent and currently running. Note that this show is a bit more locally-topical, so you might not catch all the context unless you're at least a bit up on British politics or pop culture.  Did I mention I'm a squealing Charlie Brooker fanboy? He's also done some fictional drama and comedy as well. These are harder to find decent copies of on YouTube. The high seas, the sketchy back-alleys of the Web, or overseas shipping are your best bet to find these.   Black Mirror YouTube/Netflix/Reddit - Drama, Sci-fi - (Link goes to a search query because it's rather scattershot) is an exceptionally good sci-fi sort of show. It's described as the ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Outer Limits"" of the 21st Century, and rightly so. While it's not the same '50s morality plays, it's the same formula of examining a contemporary anxiety by way of metaphorically-related speculative fiction. A Touch of Cloth (No link, as it's hard to find a complete set on YT) - Parody - I don't know if this is a contentious opinion or not, but I'd argue that this is less a British comedy, than a British person making an American-style comedy. In short, this is Police Squad for the CSI generation. It's got the gag-a-minute rapid-fire of a Zucker Brothers flick, and it lampoons the modern police procedural quite well. Given the rest of Brooker's work, this is an outlier, but if you like The Naked Gun style movies, it's definitely one to check out. Dead Set YouTube - Parody - I wasn't as fond of this show, but it wasn't terrible. The premise is basically that a Big Brother cast, given their isolation, are some of the few left after a zombie plauge, and they're all awful, shallow idiots.    Okay, enough about Brooker...   Life on Mars Hulu+ and Ashes to Ashes Hulu+ - Drama/Sci-Fi-ish/Period - Is it good? Well, these two shows are the reason I got a Region 2-capable DVD player[1]. So, yes, that's my ringing endorsement. Life on Mars follows a police officer who gets hit by a car and is inexplicably sent back to 1973. From what I've heard it's more dramatic than accurate, but the period representation is done well enough to be seamless and fade into the background, it's got ham-fisted action and 1970s style, while still staying grounded enough to be dramatic, and it's odd and twisty enough to satisfy a quirk-lover like me. Ashes to Ashes sends another police officer back to 1981 to meet (most of) the same gang from Life on Mars. While it risks being ""more of the same"", it transcends by bringing its own style, and gets into its own stride by the middle of the first season, and is a suitable cap-off to the story started in Life on Mars. That Mitchell and Webb Look YouTube Hulu - Sketch Comedy - A solid sketch-comedy show from some of the best. If you like sketch comedy, I heartily recommend it. (You're likely to see some things you've heard referenced.) Peep Show YouTube/Netflix/Hulu+ - Sitcom - This is a sitcom starring the aforementioned Mitchell and Webb. The gimmick here is that it's ""through the eyes of the characters"", but IMO, that gets old and eventually fades into the background anyway. As a show, it's pretty funny and solidly made, though I haven't been watching it as much just because there's so damned much of it, and I can't find the time to binge up to current-day. Ambassadors Hulu - Comedy, but with a bit of drama - Yet another Mitchell and Webb vehicle, this one kind of wobbles all over the place on a solid ground of comedy, but unsure if it wants to toss drama in there as well. That said, I still keep it around and watch it every now and then, 'cause it's got quite a few good lines and moments, and is still solidly entertaining.   And of course, what would a British TV round-up be without panel shows?   QI YouTube, latest series/Hulu, older series - And what list of panel shows would be complete without QI? It's a general-knowledge quiz where all the panelists are comedians so they don't know the answers anyway. Never Mind the Buzzcocks YouTube, Latest season ep. 1 - This show has been going on for far longer than I've been watching it, so of course according to all the oldsters, I apparently missed out on all the best ones. Well, I'm here to tell you that the last season wasn't all that great, I liked the guest-host seasons more, and apparently they've ended the show, so all hope is lost. Here, have my personal favorite episode with Richard Ayoade of The IT Crowd, and my second-favorite episode with Jack Whitehall fawning over Kriss Akabusi, who's filling in for Aston Merrygold. Big Fat Quiz of the Year YouTube - The panel-show culmination of the year. They're usually pretty funny.   Then there're a few that I'm not over the moon about, but I'll watch them if they're on (my YouTube feed). Meh, I'm just not that into game shows:   Would I Lie To You? YouTube - Panel/Game - A panel/game show with comedians and celebrity guests. One player has to read off a fact about themselves that they've been given, and the others must determine whether it's true or not. Have I Got News For You YouTube - Panel - Guests play something resembling a game, but mostly just bullshit over topical news events. It's topical, so it's a bit opaque until you can follow along with British news and politics. Mock the Week YouTube - Panel - Basically you could just copy the same description from Have I Got News For You in for Mock The Week. On paper they're the same sort of thing. MtW has a bit less on-topic and more general-comedy feel, as well as freeform segments that stray from the topics of the day. 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown YouTube - Panel/Game - A spinoff and mash-up putting the cast of 8 out of 10 Cats (a show where panelists attempt to answer questions about public-opinion polls, though that's not brought through in this show) and various comedians into a game of Countdown (a game where people try to put together numbers and letters to make sums and long words, respectively). The usual panel-show format of ""put comedians on a game show where nobody really pays attention to about the score"", though it's building off an established game-show[2].   [1] If you're looking for a region-unlockable DVD player, watch for older Philips models, especially the ones with HDMI-out. They tend to have PAL/NTSC conversion, as well as a secret code you can enter on the remote to change regions. That, or oddball off-brands, as ""cheap and lazy"" often translates into ""hackable and versatile"". There are websites that can tell you if a certain model has unlock codes, and what they are.  [2] Admittedly, I've never seen standard-issue Countdown, so I'm mostly guessing."
BritishTV,3c1xb1,SuperFLEB,3,Sat Jul 4 03:51:03 2015 UTC,"/u/Gwendalenia, one caveat about Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes:  The dialogue can be really hard to understand for an American (the accents to a certain extent, but mainly the slang and the 1970s British cultural references).  I started watching Life on Mars while visiting a friend who grew up in England, and she'd pause it every now and then to explain a cultural reference or to translate some British slang.  I tried watching more episodes when I got home from that trip, but found it really hard to understand.  (And I came of age in the 70s, so I imagine it would be even more difficult for someone who's young.)    Check it out anyway, though; if you can follow along, it's a really, really great series."

Funny thing is, it was actually researching test patterns and test cards that first piqued my interest in the show (Wikihole: Test Pattern > Test Card >  Test Card F > In Popular Culture: The hallucinatory little girl in Life on Mars was from Test Card F).  As for the rest of the references that stuck in my craw, I cleared those up by way of web searches of the stranger phrases, or just letting it ride and glossing over it in context.

I'd watched the first episode or two, and it just didn't click with me. The characters that were supposed to be obnoxious did so to a fault, it felt a bit blatant and hamfisted at times, and I suspect that maybe I just had to be a bit older in the 1990s to really get the joke. (I graduated high school in 2000, in BFE flyover America, so while I was geeking out on the technological euphoria of the late '90s, I wasn't old enough to be much beyond an isolated dabbler, so the cultural/professional aspects the show parodies were off my radar.) Basically, it all came off as an in-joke parody where I didn't get to see the source material.

The desperate attempts to get girls, to sneakily get one's hands on booze and then making a complete tit of oneself after consuming it, trying to get into pubs and clubs, driving a shitty little car, trying to fit in, dealing with bullies etc. Most of all, it just depicts the whole experience as being rather crap.

The Mighty Boosh - an avant-guard programme written by Noel Fielding and Julian Barret. If you've ever seen the New Zealand programme Flight of the Conchords it is similar to that, but far more off the wall.  Each episode is relatively independent of one another, and each of the 3 seasons has a different setting. All episodes are fantastic to me, though."

Both are just fantastic.   Luther is a gritty cop show about a brilliant yet troubled detective but it's just so much more than that. One of my favourite aspects on the rare occasion it appears in a show is realism. Genuine, honest emotion, situations, reactions. I'd say Luther does this a bit but Utopia does this more.   Utopia is a conspiracy drama. David fincher is actually doing a version for HBO and on the wiki page he said he loves the honesty of it and the characters. It's a show with great visuals, relateable characters. No spoilers ahead, all first episode stuff It starts off talking about a comic book called the Utopia manuscript which its cult following have different takes on. They're not sure if it's real, madeup or what. It turns out there's a second Utopia manuscript, a sequel, unpublished. The fans obviously want to get a hold of it and one does and offers to share it with a select group of other fans. But two men also want to get ahold of it for unknown motives at first and are willing to go to brutal lengths to get it. The acting is terrific.   A new show that is only 3 episodes in so far is Humans. Apparently it's on AMC too but it's set in the UK and made by the same channel that made Utopia, as well as AMC. Similar feel to Utopia in a sense but different subject. It's about ""synthetics"", android service robots. It also follows a group of a human and 4 synthetics with AI, which no other synthetic has, when they are split up. One ending up in a family's home. That part of the show follows the synthetic in its role in the family.  I would also recommend Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes as suggested elsewhere.  Edit: Misfits. Think heroes but realistic. A bunch of young offenders are doing community service when a freak lightning storm hits and they get powers. They don't go and become heroes but do pretty much what you'd expect them to do and go about their lives, encountering others affected by the storm and having funny stories. Most say the first 2 or 3 series were the best. There is some truth to that but I'd probably watch it all the way through first time around.  Black books. The league of Gentlemen."

Also, it's so deadpan but laugh-out-loud funny. It's set inside the smoking room of an office.  also, 15 Storeys High is really odd and dark and kind of surreal. It's a sort of odd-couple thing; an innocent optimist moves in with a bullying misanthrope. I think all the episodes of both series are all on youtube, luckily.

You just don't have the vocabulary for it yet. I know what's going on for you. I was there myself, four or five years ago. Jeeves and Wooster led me to Fry and Laurie, and then I discovered QI. Well naturally being introduced to David Mitchell, Bill Bailey, Alan Davies, Sean Lock, Johnny Vegas, Sarah Millican, Jo Brand, Jimmy Carr, and many, many many, many others whom I will stop enumerating for the sake of space although I do also quite like Jack Whitehall, I went down many new rabbit-holes. My girlfriend is also a Yankee Anglophile so while I was watching panel shows (which are mostly my thing) we watched shows like Black Books, Jonathan Creek, and Gavin & Stacy together. Rob Brydon, by the way, is my favorite human being. The combination of sitcoms and panel shows and note-taking to do some Wikipedia research on what other projects people have done has continued to provide me with wonderful entertainment, although I'm still at my giddiest when there's a new WILTY, HIGNFY, QI, or the rarer Big Fat Quiz of the Year, which is what I think you meant by Big Ass Quiz."

The comedy centres on his difficulties adjusting to life in the outback and his eccentric fellow astronomers. The first series was released in the United Kingdom and Australia in October 2005 and consisted of six 30-minute episodes. The second series began airing on 3 August 2006 in the UK.

I know of the term 'cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey', and that the brass monkey is actually a device that used to be used to store cannonballs, and when it got very freezing cold, the balls would apparently fall off, so not entirely sure what the actual joke is. I could probably look it up, but it's hot enough to weld the balls onto a brass monkey at the moment1 and I can't be bothered.  1 That's not quite as well-known a phrase.

The reference to the testes (as the term balls is commonly understood to mean) of the brass monkey appears to be a 20th-century variant on the expression, prefigured by a range of references to other body parts, especially the nose and tail.  During the 19th and 20th centuries, small monkeys cast from the alloy brass were very common tourist souvenirs from China and Japan. They usually, but not always, came in a set of three representing the Three Wise Monkeys carved in wood above the Shrine of Toshogu in NikkÅ, Japan. These monkeys were often cast with all three in a single piece. In other sets they were made singly. Although three was the usual number, some sets of monkeys added a fourth, with its hand covering its genitals. Old brass monkeys of this type are collectors' items.

BritishTV,3bicyb,black_pepper,3,Mon Jun 29 16:06:53 2015 UTC,"Most of the praise came from the USA, whose frustration with NBC (the de-facto part owner of the IOC) after their botched non-live OC broadcast in 2012 (the worst offense being the refusal to air the 7/7 memorial sequence in favor of a Michael Phelps interview with the host of the American version of Pop Idol) have forced them with no other choice than to resort to pirated streaming sites (Stream2Watch, FirstRowSports) & use VPNs to bypass the geoblocking of international broadcasters, including the BBC.   Rather than holding NBC accountable for sub-par quality & resolve the problem of lost viewership to piracy, Thomas Bach chose to kick the can down the road & simply hand the rights to air it for another 18 long years to NBC without any bidding process."
BritishTV,3bicyb,JoseTwitterFan,9,Mon Jun 29 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"I was definitely one of those who streamed the opening (and closing) London ceremonies live off the BBC website.  I really liked it, but then later all my friends were complaining about how terrible it was, and I was confused.  That's when I found out about things like Bob Costas talking shit about some of the athletes, and how they kept talking over some of the stuff in the show that you were meant to be able to hear.  And of course, like you mentioned, ignoring the 7/7 memorial and not broadcasting Muse's Olympic song.  NBC is fucking awful."
BritishTV,3bicyb,HoboSnacks,10,Mon Jun 29 19:51:13 2015 UTC,"2012 NBC Opening ceremonies - The awful commentary that never shut up, purposefully cutting to the wrong cameras, ungracefully chopping it up with commercials at weird times, ruining the flow of the whole thing.  To top it off, they gutted the NHS part (the overhead shot of the people holding lights to spell NHS was not aired, they casually mention ""this is honor health care workers"" later but mostly tried to pass it off as a harry potter/fairy tale type thing).  I wonder why they wanted to cut that out?  Hmm...  It remains the greatest thing you can show anyone on how we are being actively manipulated in the US to be uncaring of the rest of the world and keep up this we're the best shit.  Show someone the NBC version of the 2012 olympics opening ceremony, and then the BBC.  It's a whole different thing.  I literally said ""holy fuck"" when I watched the BBC version and saw the NHS overhead shot, completely cut out of NBC."
BritishTV,3bicyb,NNTPgrip,7,Mon Jun 29 20:13:57 2015 UTC,The really depressing thing about hearing all of that is that the director of the ceremony Danny Boyle didn't want any commentary at all. The BBC lead commentator had to meet with him prior and assure him that the commentary team would keep it to a minimum. After it happened the replay on iPlayer was available without commentary and you can see why Boyle just wanted people to get swept away by the music and the show.

It's not like the industry needs that money to survive or anything, if people weren't willing to pay as may to watch football, there would be less money in it and footballers' ludicrous wages might come down to a semblance of a normal salary.

They are a big company with a lot of money and it's a commercial decision by the IOC solely. Don't forget that Eurosport is Free To Air is most European countries (just not ours!).  Discovery has dabbled with sports recently, using Quest to show them in the UK on Freeview - they also own that channel. It doesn't affect us until 2022 Winter Olympics as the BBC still has the contract until 2020 anyway. This FAQ explains it very well: http://www.a516digital.com/2015/06/faq-olympics-rights.html"

Access to the Olympics will become more expensive after 2020, and it will be less likely that many of us who watched many hours of BBC coverage daily will do that again, even if we're streaming the material."
BritishTV,3bicyb,socks,3,Mon Jun 29 19:29:45 2015 UTC,"That's correct, though it is a very long way off and how we consume media then will probably be very different from how we do it now. It'll probably mostly be delivered by elastic digital / IPTV channels through enabled TVs by then. Discovery has announced an Olympics channel but how we see that shaping up is anyone's guess - probably a 360 type setup with most if not all being delivered digitally.  It's quite likely that the BBC won't be funded in the same way that it is now by 2022 which adds a further, but unknown, level of complexity to the situation. There's nothing to say ITV etc could outbid the BBC even.  If you want to see where we're going just take a look at the new BT Sport deal. The Discovery group are bigger than you think and have been cherry picking off bits of licencing and buying channels - much like how BT Sport have been doing over the past 2 years or so.  Ultimately, money talks and large organisations sell to the highest bidder, as can be seen by the crazy money Sky have splashed out on the last rights round for Premier League football."

It's likely imho that a large number, possibly even a majority, will be watching it via a network stream instead of broadcast TV.  It's interesting that it's a pan-Europe deal. Under the current system you can pay e.g. a Spanish provider for sports coverage that Sky normally sell in the UK and this is all 100% above board. By obtaining an agreement for the whole of Europe this is no longer an issue. I wonder if this was a factor, the Sky ruling was not too long ago and did upset the licensing world a fair bit."

The serial, first broadcast on BBC One in 2003, was produced in-house by the BBC in association with the independent production company Endor Productions. It starred David Morrissey, John Simm, Kelly Macdonald, Polly Walker, Bill Nighy, and James McAvoy, telling the story of a newspaper's investigation into the death of a young woman, and centres on the relationship between the leading journalist and his old friend, who is a Member of Parliament and the murdered woman's employer.

BritishTV,3b7wdt,AimHere,2,Sat Jun 27 06:42:20 2015 UTC,"I always think Channel 4's 'A Very British Coup' makes a pretty good companion piece to House of Cards. It came out a year or two before Cards, so it has a similar almost-period-piece feel these days, but is from a left-wing perspective (the original book's author was a Labour Party MP on the left of the party); the difference in focus on the series highlights the differences in how the two ideologies view political power (Cards tends to think in terms of unscrupulous individuals grasping power, Coup tends to think of people mostly through the lens of their institutional affiliations). You can do a reasonable compare-and-contrast between the two."

In terms of soaps, I'd say the easiest would be Hollyoaks as the cast changes fairly regularly - it's set in a university town! However, all the British soaps are pretty ok to jump into - I'd say watch a couple to see what catches your attention the most, then research the character backgrounds once you've seen a few episodes. There are bound to be some story lines that you'll want to know the full history of, and Wikipedia is actually really good at summarising the characters."

I love BB, Gogglebox, The Island /w Bear Grylls, Grand Designs, etc (but only ever admit that on the internet to strangers), but my real favourites are all the amazing dramas.  Just recently watched Indian Summers, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell (final episode this Sunday). All time favourites include Broadchurch, The Shadow Line, Luther, Happy Valley (back again soon), and too many others to even count.  If you like ""bad"" UK TV, definitely try some of the ""good"" shows. Netflix has tons of them. The shorter seasons (usually 6-10 episodes) make the shows feel a lot tighter and more focused than the longer 16-24 episode American seasons.  PS: There is a BBUK subreddit (/r/bbuk) - not sure how long you've been watching the show (or how much you know about the time warp housemates outside of the show) but I can't wait to watch these next few episodes. Do you watch Bit on the Side? I'll refrain from saying anything else about what's coming in case you don't, but last night on BOTS they showed a preview clip of what's coming tonight that's going to be amazingly bad TV (and I can't freakin' wait) LOL."

Inbetweeners was great, as was Misfits (but it went downhill for sure).  If you like 30 minute comedies then Bad Education was awesome (it's done, so probably on youtube or whatever), Inside No. 9 is one of my favs but kind of....weird. Dark comedy, but you gotta give it a few episodes since each episode is a new story/setting.  I started BBUK during the last C4 series (Josie won) and have watched all the C5 ones (including Celebrity series'), don't know what it is that makes that show so addictive.  Rylan is awesome, first saw him on X-Factor (another ""bad"" reality show I watch every year. I only watch the UK version, and it's the only show like that I've ever watched). Never got into Britains Got Talent. You could also check out ""I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!"", you might like that.  Do you like panel shows like QI? There's also an /r/panelshow if you're into that. I like Mock the Week, 8 out of 10 Cats, etc....  There was also a really good medical drama that just finished called Critical.  Going into list mode to just mention some other good stuff I have watched (some on-going, some done) that you might not have heard about:   Broadchurch Banana Cucumber Episodes (UK/US co-production) The Fall Humans (brand new but really good so far) Uncle   Enjoy! :)  EDIT: BTW, I pay for a VPN that's only like $30/year and it lets me watch BBC iPlayer, C4 Catch-Up, etc. Much better quality and easier than trying to find stuff on YouTube."

I just don't like the format...  Yes - Celebrity Juice is a panel show. Basically just a bunch of actors/comedians joking around, almost like a game show but not really. Sometimes there are points, sometimes not, but the points are entirely irrelevant in the grander scheme of things.  I've never watched Loose Women, but my understanding is that it's just a copy of The View (or The View is a copy of Loose Women, not sure which came first). Not my kind of thing.  I'm not into singing comps either which is why my small obsession with the UK X-Factor is a bit weird. It's not my fav, but I still watch it.  I mostly download shows via torrent if I can't watch them on their respective websites using the VPN. If there was a way for me to get them via satellite or something I'd rather do that (I've actually looked into it), but there isn't.  It's annoying that there are so many good shows in other countries and the only way to get them is to pirate them, but it is what it is I guess."
BritishTV,3b3b6x,SolopsismSux,2,Thu Jun 25 17:51:51 2015 UTC,"yup, sounds about right, i'm in the same boat.  get what i can off of netflix, youtube and torrents. if i could get a satellite that would get me all those awesome channels i would do that in a flash!  i get so mad when they take down the BB youtube channels lol.  Why don't they want us international viewers to watch (i know really it has nothing to do with it but still!)?"
BritishTV,3b3b6x,gelectrox,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:55:49 2015 UTC,"The satellite thing is just impossible. Basically, when I looked into it, the coverage just doesn't reach here (I'm in NS BTW, so if it doesn't reach me it's not gonna reach anywhere in Canada).  The only real solution I found to getting stuff ""live"" is if you can get a friend in the UK to add an extra box to their satellite/cable plan just for you, and then use a Slingbox to re-send it over the internet to here. That said, I don't know anyone that I could say ""hey, would you mind just putting this random satellite receiver, and this extra box, in a closet in your house AND upgrading your internet plan so I can piggy-back on your subscription?"" to LOL.  At least I have a good torrent site to use (I'd highly recommend you find a private tracker, the one I use uploads the shows literally minutes after they finish airing but it's not taking new members). I also have a seedbox (basically a server that downloads my torrents for me automatically) that syncs to my home network. So lets say BB ends at 6PM (my time), it's usually ready for me to watch by 6:15-6:30, which all things considered isn't really that bad."
BritishTV,3b3b6x,mistermonstermash,2,Thu Jun 25 19:07:37 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, what VPN do you use? I'm also in Canada and I can't find anything decent to watch the BBC Live iPlayer since Zenmate made UK premium :( Everything else is hella slow and crashy. I wouldnt mind paying 30 bucks a year though if its decent!"
BritishTV,3b3b6x,shutyourgob,0,Fri Jun 26 02:11:51 2015 UTC,"I just use PIA. Honestly, I didn't do any research so there are probably likely better alternatives out there. That said, PIA is probably the biggest VPN provider right now, and they have access points in so...many...countries...that I don't feel any need to switch.   I've been using them for over a year and have had no problems with speed or downtime or anything like that. There have been some weird moments, but usually disconnecting/reconnecting fixes it. I blame stuff like that on internet weirdness in general though, not on the VPN :).  EDIT: Note: I don't use the PIA software, I use OpenVPN (basically just integrates the VPN into your OS). I can't comment on the quality of their software."

I was on a budget flight to Norway when a storm forced us to ditch in Prestwick. It's so hilly up there, you can't get any signal on your carphone. It looked bad. It looked like I'd have to spend the night in Glasgow. Jesus Christ! The cabin crew suggested we all go out and club it. I had no option. I figured it'd be safer on the streets. I saw the Scotch in their natural habitat - and it weren't pretty. I'd seen them in stations before, being loud, but now I was surrounded. It felt like they were watching me. Fish-white flesh puckered by the highland breeze. Tight eyes peering out. Screechy booze-soaked voices hollering for a taxi to take 'em to the next pub. A shatter of glass. A round of applause. A 16-year-old mother of three vomiting in a sewer, bairns looking on, chewing on potato cakes. I ain't never goin' back. Not never."

BritishTV,3azats,alephnul,0,Fri Jun 26 16:14:22 2015 UTC,"Wow, that guy is right. You really are a insufferable pretentious arse. Taylor Swift doesn't 'prance around on stage in revealing clothing to sell her act'. She can sing and/or play a musical instrument with great skill just like those other artists you mentioned.   She was the youngest person to win the Album of the Year Grammy, was honoured by the Songwriters Hall of Fame at only 19 years old and won the Nashville Songwriters Association International Award for Songwriter/Artist of the Year aged only 17.   I'm pretty sure that people will still know who she is in 20 years time and she will still be riding high.  Just because you don't like the type of music she makes doesn't make her music less of a musical accomplishment."
BritishTV,3azats,wordsfromlee,0,Sun Jul 5 16:15:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll give you another chance to call me names. The conversation was over a week ago, so we are probable the only ones here now.   Ms. Swift is competent with a guitar, and bad on a banjo. She can play a ukulele, but who can't? I am told that she can play a piano. That isn't exactly what you would call great skill, but I get it, you like her.  I assume that you are a grown person, based on reddit's user stats, I might reasonably guess, a grown man. Don't you feel a little silly listening to the musical equivalent of a Disney princess movie? I know that she is popular, but I don't know any grown up people who will admit to liking her music.   As far as her prancing around in revealing outfits: Have you ever seen any of her videos? When people started calling me an idiot in this thread, I went out to see some, just to see if I was missing something. My guess is that she spends more on costumes and makeup in those things than she does on musicians.   She is a beautiful girl, and fun to look at, and god knows she is popular. The point of my original post was that popular does not necessarily equal good. Mrs. Brown's Boys is popular, but maybe you think that is good too.   I am sorry that I slagged off one of your favorite performers."
BritishTV,3azats,alephnul,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:20:28 2015 UTC,"She's not one of my favourite performers. I'm not a fan of her music at all but I can still have an appreciation for her ability to write the music she does and how well she does it. She hasn't racked up all those awards and record sales on looks alone.  I presume you are entirely basing your opinions on her by the pop music she's been releasing over the past couple of years and not by the more country-styled music that she released before that that made her popular?  You said that popular doesn't necessarily equal good which is correct, but as I said, just because you don't like an artist or type of music doesn't make it bad."

I could name them all day long. What they have in common is talent. The ones who are beautiful don't rely on their beauty to sell their music. They can sing, and/or play a musical instrument with great skill. None of them dance. None of them prance around on stage in revealing clothing to sell their act.  Pop music has always been around. It is what it is, lightweight ear candy for the easily entertained. It is ephemeral. When it passes it leaves us thinking ""What did we ever find appealing about that?"". Real music endures. It becomes more appealing, not less, as the years go by.  Taylor Swift is a pop icon. Good for her. She should make a ton of money at it. In 20 years no one will remember her."

I also really enjoy the different settings, culture, pacing, themes, etc. that are present in TV shows made in other countries.  The problem seems to be getting good English sub-titles for a lot of them, as simply there has not been the demand to get them created.  Hopefully this will change that (or C4 will simply pay for them to be made).  I'd love to see things from further-afield too - I'm sure there is tons of great content from Asia, South America, and so on."

Even Humans on Channel 4 is not as good as it's Swedish counterpart."

I wish the beeb did more documentaries and educational programs since clearly no private broadcasters is going to.
BritishTV,3ap1ms,archersongs,3,Mon Jun 22 13:02:56 2015 UTC,"The BBC does already do an awful lot of documentaries, and there are actually a lot of documentaries aimed at younger generations on BBC3 itself"

BritishTV,3ap1ms,lamby,4,Mon Jun 22 14:57:12 2015 UTC,I still haven't forgiven the BBC for axing In The Flesh
BritishTV,3ap1ms,twogunsalute,3,Mon Jun 22 20:48:50 2015 UTC,"It seems like a very easy target as the target audience - teenagers and young adults - aren't exactly influential in BBC decision making. I might be willing to give them it on budget if not for the truly absurd things they said they were planning to spend the money on. BBC 1 +1, really?"
BritishTV,3ap1ms,TenebrousEye,3,Mon Jun 22 20:27:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's no great loss, BBC3 has some good ideas for documenataries but they send well-intentioned, if naive people like Reggie Yates, or just downright shit people like Stacey Dooley.   DJs are not investigative reporters and shouldn't pretend to be. The 3rd one in Yates' was probably the best, but only because he could personally relate to the life of a model having been one, on the others he was too concerned with staying impartial that he didn't challenge anything controversial that was said.  Other than the documenatires I'm really stuggling to think of any shows that are my cup of tea. SS&SP is the biggest load of bollocks on TV, it's an open secret everyone on the show is in on it and then what else have you got?"
BritishTV,3ap1ms,rappersdo,5,Tue Jun 23 22:59:17 2015 UTC,"BB3 have a abundance of good documentaries about social problems, and also a whole range of shows talking about mental health and mental issues. Teenagers - as the key demographic for the channel - need to have some of these shown to them in such a volatile point in their life. That's why we have Sun, Sex and Suspicious Parents and Don't Tell The Bride in order to get the viewers in the first place. To axe BBC3 would be a travesty, and it can easily get rid of it because their teenage viewers can't do a damn thing about it. Even if it went to online only I believe that the budget would be axed and all quality content it was known for producing would vanish."
BritishTV,3ap1ms,Doddyno2,4,Mon Jun 22 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"If its shows weren't shite people would wanna save it. I don't think anyone feels like it's vital that it sticks around. The BBC could condense all their decent programming into one channel at the moment, but BBC3 became almost entirely filler, painfully aimed at da youths. The BBC isn't good at comedy anymore, let alone when it's aiming for a demographic."

I always read them shitting on global warming as tongue in cheek. I know some say they are offensive but they've never said anything that makes me bat and eye. Then again few comedians ever really have while performing.   I just don't get the hate.
BritishTV,3amc4d,KarmaUK,12,Sun Jun 21 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"IMHO Clarkson is a reactionary right-wing conservative and twat.  Stewart Lee said this: ""The African-American stand-up Chris Rock maintained that stand-up comedy should always be punching upwards. Itâs a heroic little struggle. You canât be a right-wing clown without some character caveat, some vulnerability, some obvious flaw. Youâre on the right. Youâve already won. You have no tragedy. Youâre punching down. You can be a right-wing comedy columnist, away from the public eye, a disembodied, authoritarian presence that doesnât need to show doubt. Who could be on a stage, crowing about their victory and ridiculing those less fortunate than them without any sense of irony, shame or self-knowledge? Thatâs not a stand-up comedian. Thatâs just a cunt.""  from: Where are all the right-wing stand-ups?  edit double words."
BritishTV,3amc4d,Sidian,3,Sun Jun 21 18:58:11 2015 UTC,"As much as I love stewart Lee I think he himself has recommended both Andrew Lawrence and Simon Evans as people who are to the right of centre, but manage to be funny about it, also Bob Mills, brilliant stand up of a few decades now.  I think it's just a lot harder to be a right wing stand up comedian, because it is expected that you'll 'punch upwards', but if you can make it funny, it's fine.  Andrew Lawrence pulls a similar thing to the legendary Jerry Sadowitz, in making himself a loser, taking away the sting of what he says, because he's portraying himself as a bitter individual who hates everything."
BritishTV,3amc4d,waldron76,6,Sun Jun 21 22:53:02 2015 UTC,"You can't   There's a lot of that phrase repeated there. You can't punch down, you can't be a right wing comedian. And why can't you? Because it's not something that's enjoyed by people? No, clearly not - Top Gear and Jeremy Clarkson's brand of humour are incredibly popular and bring joy to many millions of people. No, the reason 'you can't' is because it offends the sensibilities of whiny, rich left wingers like Stewart Lee who have no real problems so focus on complaining about irrelevant and harmless jokes. And if you can get in a few jabs at the working class who are often fans of this style of comedy, as Stewart Lee condescendingly does in your linked article, then all the better - those stupid poor people just don't understand real comedy like the rich, Oxbridge-educated Stewart Lee do they? He's punching up, you see."
BritishTV,3amc4d,wh3873,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:44:15 2015 UTC,"No, the reason 'you can't' is because it offends the sensibilities of whiny, rich left wingers like Stewart Lee who have no real problems so focus on complaining about irrelevant and harmless jokes.   I mean, the reason many comedians say ""you can't"" punch down is because, in their (informed) opinions, it a) makes for shit comedy, and b) doesn't really work on a theoretical level. Nothing to do with offended sensibilities, as you (and many others on the right) seem to assume is the impetus of all cultural criticism from a left-wing perspective.   nd if you can get in a few jabs at the working class who are often fans of this style of comedy   Don't see any jabs in the working class in the linked article.

BritishTV,3amc4d,EpicTacoProject,3,Mon Jun 22 18:31:07 2015 UTC,I've always disagreed with that statement. Comedy is easier if you punch up. But sometimes you can punch sideways or punch down in a clever way. Sometimes you don't punch.   Still I don't see how any of that comes into play with their show.
BritishTV,3amc4d,wh3873,5,Sun Jun 21 19:12:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's complete bullshit and not even applicable to Top Gear.  Just a way of putting down entertainers they don't like without outright saying it's because they don't like them (see OP's implied ""conservative=evil"" remark)."

It's a great bit with a good message but it's certainly not punching up by Chris Rock. It's introspective of him and his community. It's a bit only a black comedian could tell for a lot of reasons but it's not punching up.   I think Stewart Lee is funny but he just seems to have a hard on against the Top Gear guys and will use any argument to get people on his side. No matter how lasy and poorly thought out it is.
BritishTV,3amc4d,Crivens1,2,Sun Jun 21 19:37:48 2015 UTC,"Bit tricky cos I'm a fan too but the BBC have had to apologise to Mexico, got told off for the slope joke and saying ginger beer (queer) as an insult by ofcom (our version of the FCC), Clarkson apologised for saying Nigger (which I don't think he actually did) and also said that a group of protesters should be shot on prime time TV.

It will be important to let them find their own chemistry and make their own show otherwise it will be forever compared to its last iteration. Personally I think Guy Martin is fantastic - whether he'd work well with Evans is debatable - and his inclusion might actually get me to watch the show.
BritishTV,3aauxt,gophercuresself,6,Thu Jun 18 18:39:44 2015 UTC,"I've liked him in the things I've seen. If the original guys end up getting their own show, and Top Gear changes it's dynamic slightly, but overall retains the format then it seems to me like people who like it may actually get two shows they like instead of one."
BritishTV,3aauxt,concretepigeon,5,Thu Jun 18 18:42:34 2015 UTC,Potentially yeah. I'd be really intrigued to see how closely they match the Top Gear format if the three of them do team up again. The three obviously work well together but it's easy to forget how important the format elements are to the watchability and success of the show. It takes a lot of honing to produce a great format and they'd be starting from scratch to some extent.   My main issue with Guy Martin joining would be losing him from his own TV (for want of a better word) vehicles as they're generally thoroughly watchable.
BritishTV,3aauxt,gophercuresself,6,Thu Jun 18 18:57:12 2015 UTC,"I agree. Regarding format, Guy seems much more tuned to a casual kind of 'reality' format where he gets to be himself in fun situations. Rather than introduce and present journalism pieces."
BritishTV,3aauxt,isincla,6,Thu Jun 18 20:14:29 2015 UTC,Not sure I'd call it journalism but I take your point! I especially think he might struggle with doing the contrived to the point of being virtually scripted nonsense that has been such a major part of Top Gear for the last few seasons. Half of his charm comes from the seemingly genuine way he approaches and reacts to situations. Constructed storylines don't seem like they'd play that well with that.
BritishTV,3aauxt,gophercuresself,2,Thu Jun 18 20:42:41 2015 UTC,"Perhaps he'll have his own roving segment where he's free to explore his own ideas each week. Less script, more Martin."

BritishTV,3aauxt,listyraesder,2,Fri Jun 19 20:34:43 2015 UTC,"You're right, the potential is to end up with two second rate versions of Top Gear. Depends what level of control they get, and how well they can cope with doing stuff that's too heavily associated with the old show.  Hopefully Guy Martin would be able to do his own stuff. The old team could, but he's C4, while they were all BBC for the stuff they hosted."
BritishTV,3aauxt,concretepigeon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:43:27 2015 UTC,"Top Gear was brilliant, so even a second rate Top Gear would still be good"
BritishTV,3aauxt,PartyPoison98,2,Mon Jun 29 19:31:45 2015 UTC,"I reckon we'll end up with a new Clarkson, Hammond and May show thats not quite as good as the old Top Gear as it lacks the amazing crew, and then on the BBC we'll have a sort of Fifth Gear/Top Gear thing"
BritishTV,3aauxt,PartyPoison98,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:31:01 2015 UTC,It also took more than a decade to get the Top Gear mix working.

BritishTV,3aauxt,jezmck,8,Thu Jun 18 21:18:05 2015 UTC,"BBC article the other day described Guy Martin as a ""former motorcycle racer""... I literally watched him racing only a few days ago."
BritishTV,3aauxt,Disgruntled__Goat,3,Thu Jun 18 20:11:22 2015 UTC,They may have misinterpreted something Guy said a few months ago.  tl;dr - he's thinking of doing less races next year.
BritishTV,3aauxt,crucible,8,Fri Jun 19 09:23:07 2015 UTC,"They agreed after Hammond's crash that if one left the show, they all would. And they seem to be sticking to their word."

BritishTV,3aauxt,JennyCide,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:23:45 2015 UTC,"Guy's a natural for the non-studio based side of the show, not sure how he'd cope with the more scripted formulaic bits, but those are what Chris Evans excels at. I'd love to see someone like Jodie Kidd or Suzi Perry who know their stuff and can present as well. I'd also love to see Colin Furze if Guy didn't do it (don't think it would be a good idea to have both Colin and Guy though).  Both Colin and Guy know vehicles and can do the mad mechanic engineering side."
BritishTV,3aauxt,duranko1332,-1,Wed Jun 24 20:48:43 2015 UTC,"I still think the BBC will find it IMPOSSIBLE to bring by the ""Top Gear"" brand without the Richard, James and Jeremy. It's going to be a failed venture, they need to rebrand and try something new."
BritishTV,3aauxt,Tim_Buk2,9,Fri Jun 19 14:17:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think Top Gear is long overdue for a shake up. I record all Top Gears on my dvr to watch later and I find I end up skipping through tons of stuff - Star in a Reasonably Priced Car, caravan smashing, endless hooning around on their track, stupid scripted antics, etc. It's frustrating because they do so much other, good, stuff so brilliantly.   I think Guy Martin would be great for TG from what I've seen of his other stuff."
BritishTV,3aauxt,thecrikster,7,Thu Jun 18 19:32:19 2015 UTC,"""Star in a Reasonably Priced Car, caravan smashing, endless hooning around on their track, stupid scripted antics, etc.""  I think you'll find that a significant portion of viewers - who aren't particularly interested in cars - watched TG for those moments that you mentioned. Mass appeal is what made the show popular. Unlike the purist - read dull - format they had before that."

BritishTV,3a5rcd,miraoister,5,Wed Jun 17 20:10:01 2015 UTC,"Snuff Box is perfectly described as a comedy for comedians because its a lot of ""in"" jokes in Snuff Box but it doesn't ruin it, when it hits it hits hard but when it misses, it misses hard, which can be just as funny. Toast was great but my all time number one favourite is Garth Marenghi's Darkplace. Get it, watch it, profit. They all had a hand in writing it but if you have not seen it, it will blow your mind. The DVD is usually about a fiver. If you do though, come back to me and tell me what you thought.

BritishTV,3a0j5k,miraoister,4,Tue Jun 16 07:27:02 2015 UTC,Anyone else think the BBC are testing the waters for a possible return?  I think they know any new Top Gear with new presenters is likely to fail.
BritishTV,3a0j5k,gazwel,17,Tue Jun 16 08:20:13 2015 UTC,"I think they're trying to get their money's worth out of the footage they've already recorded, really. Top Gear was, IIRC, the BBC's most expensive show and just having a-series-except-the-studio-bits worth of footage sitting on a shelf has to hurt."
BritishTV,3a0j5k,oneonetwooneonetwo,6,Tue Jun 16 09:21:21 2015 UTC,"As much as the Clarkson fans are desperate for the BBC to take him back, I'd say here it is about practicality. He appeared in the programme, they want to air the stuff that was filmed before his abrupt departure, so they paid him to come in and do some one off work. The BBC gets to show the final footage and Clarkson gets a few grand. Win win.  It's not as if he's banned from the BBC or anything"
BritishTV,3a0j5k,vzzzbux,3,Tue Jun 16 16:30:11 2015 UTC,"Considering they've just hired Chris Evans, apparently not..."

BritishTV,39wg57,TopTrumpWANKER,6,Mon Jun 15 10:35:22 2015 UTC,Bit of a shame how they won't even show Stephen hawking's actual face on a magazine
BritishTV,39wg57,CA3080,11,Mon Jun 15 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The Radio Times is a TV and Film magazine and this article is about Stephen Hawking in relation to a Film about Stephen Hawking. The film needs to be referenced in some way in the title/cover otherwise the article wouldn't make sense in the context of a TV/film magazine. I don't think that they were refraining from showing Stephen Hawking's face on the cover, I think they needed to show the actors face in order for the title to make sense."
BritishTV,39wg57,legendhairymonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:28:17 2015 UTC,The TV show which they are covering features the real Stephen Hawking though. So they don't need Eddie Redmayne spread across the cover. There are plenty of old photos of hawking if they want him as a young man.
BritishTV,39wg57,everydayadrawing,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"Yes but the point is that the cover picture/title wouldn't make as much sense. They want anyone glancing at that cover to know exactly what the article will be about, this needs to be simple and clear to anyone. If they just had the title ""the real Stephen Hawking"" and a picture of Stephen Hawking, it wouldn't be immediately apparent that this is an article relating to the film as well."
BritishTV,39wg57,legendhairymonkey,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:10:32 2015 UTC,"But there are people with public personas who haven't had movies made about them where the headline would work.  Imagine a documentary ""The Real Neil Degrasse Tyson"" with a picture of him on the cover advertising a documentary that followed him around and interviewed him about his life.   Wouldn't that make complete sense?"
BritishTV,39wg57,everydayadrawing,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:55:17 2015 UTC,"Well of course it would, but that is a completely different scenario.  Edit: My point is more that to explain the article as best as possible and lure more people into buying the magazine this set up works best."
BritishTV,39wg57,legendhairymonkey,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:05:00 2015 UTC,I think it's interesting to consider whether the incongruity of the headline was intentional or not. I think it's 50/50 either way but if it was intentional I don't think it works that well.  With that said Redmayne is a good looking dude so it probably sells more copies this way.
BritishTV,39wg57,everydayadrawing,2,Fri Jun 19 14:10:58 2015 UTC,Doesn't Becker live in Miami? That makes his story somewhat unsurprising if he does.

I felt sorry for the doctor who didn't want his upgrade because his synth had so many memories and as soon as asimov's 3 laws was mentioned I was so happy. I didn't like the elder daughter until I understood why she was so angry and she feels like the synths are going to take away her future prospects so why should she bother.

The bar crowd overwhelm interviews, they seem impersonal. C4 should get scroobillis pip to front a show, he is funny and has depth. Lets have some witty provocative stand up, opinion and diverse music. I like to see something which brings together the best of  the 11 o'clock show,  the culture show (minus the high brow bits) Ã nd VICE with a 6 music sensibility. I want texture and depth and I want it to be both confronting and entertaining.  Do that C4, don't rehash this."

BritishTV,38uqcq,alephnul,34,Sun Jun 7 00:10:18 2015 UTC,"I think she's always been annoying, but nowadays she seems less annoying because we let the likes of Piers Morgan, Katie Hopkins, and Simon Cowell on screen, so she's now a minor irritant at best.  Back in the 90s however, she was world class awfulness."
BritishTV,38uqcq,KarmaUK,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:03:01 2015 UTC,"Really? She was worse before? OMG! On HIGNFY this week, she was absolutely insufferable."
BritishTV,38uqcq,gurneyslade,5,Sun Jun 7 04:06:46 2015 UTC,"Was actually bracing myself when she was announced as a guest this week, but she just seemed like a regular person.  Is this one of those things where somebody is briefly noticed for an unusual quality and becomes an easy punchline in boring News Quiz type jokes for thirty years? (Where you don't have to write a joke, you just pat the audience on the head for remembering that somebody is like something. ""Conservative party something something foodbanks something something Eric Pickles, because he's the fat one."") Rantzen might have usurped her for ""big teeth"", but I don't know if she was ever toppled for ""annoying voice""."
BritishTV,38uqcq,TVPaulD,3,Sun Jun 7 12:27:36 2015 UTC,"That sort of show is just the thing that I need though. Being a Yank, I am not familiar with the British contemporary archetypes. Watching Mock the Week and HIGNFY has allowed me to recognize that Charles Kennedy was a drunk, Cameron is a posh Etonian prick, Nick Clegg is in public life apparently solely to be the butt of jokes, and Ed Miliband seems to be a sort of poorly constructed animatronic  replica of a politician. This is important if you want to enjoy current British comedy, because listening to American news, you would never know that those people existed."
BritishTV,38uqcq,_tarasbulba,11,Sun Jun 7 15:53:50 2015 UTC,Hey now...Charles Kennedy was a lot more than a drunk. He was known as a good man fronting a no-hopers political party long before he was known as a drunk

I'm old enough to have already been familiar with her in the 80s, but after not seeing her for quite a while, every time I see her now I can't help but think of Crapston Villas, an animated comedy from the 90s, does anyone remember it?  If so can anyone tell me if there was a character that seemed based on her? I'm sure I remember one looking and sounding like a caricature version of JSP. memory not what it was though so I might just be being addled."

BritishTV,38uqcq,CharSmar,7,Sun Jun 7 06:41:26 2015 UTC,"She's always been annoying.

BritishTV,38uqcq,thejumbles,10,Sun Jun 7 07:57:46 2015 UTC,She's still on TV because she has a niche audience but they will stick by her. I personally would rather hang myself via my nose hairs than have to watch her for any length of time.

BritishTV,38uqcq,waldron76,4,Sun Jun 7 16:27:50 2015 UTC,"I just looked her up and it seems that, with a few exceptions, the programmes she was responsible for were aimed at the Average Joe. Maybe I was just terribly uncool when I was younger because I thought she was someone who championed hip culture that was way beyond my station.  And now she presents on Loose Women which, from what I've seen, is some of the worst television to grace the British airwaves."

BritishTV,38uqcq,SolopsismSux,5,Sun Jun 7 10:04:09 2015 UTC,"You need to look at he career. She started out as a journalist, presented and programme commissioner targetting at the youth market, at a time when voices on the TV and radio were usually urbane and well spoken. Her attitude and way of speaking got her lots of presenting and panelist work, as a 'yoof'-focussed antagonist.   She's far from dumb, she did a good job as editor of the Independent on Sunday and as the BBCs commissioner of youth programmes in the ...90s, I think.   Not really my cup of tea, but but being abrasive is sort of her shtick."
BritishTV,38uqcq,SolopsismSux,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:14:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for that. I didn't know any of that. I realize that she isn't really stupid. She has been a guest on QI. John Lloyd and the gang don't usually go in for genuine stupidity. She really does annoy the crap out of me though.
BritishTV,38uqcq,Jammypotatoes,2,Sun Jun 7 19:27:42 2015 UTC,"She was in her late 20s when she started making youth programming for ITV, but by the time she moved to the BBC to make youth programming for them she was in her 40s. So she was mocked quite a bit for being a middle aged women still making shows aimed at teenagers.   Her output was hit and miss, but if she hadn't been willing to take chances with unconventional stuff she probably wouldn't have commissioned Red-Dwarf. I don't like her abrasiveness on panel shows, but she has contributed a lot to making television more representative and more experimental over the years so I respect her for that."
BritishTV,38uqcq,radiobaby,2,Mon Jun 8 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"She was responsible for Red-Dwarf being made?  I withdraw all criticism of the lady. In my book she may have as many and as large teeth as she sees fit. I will, in future, view her comments in a new and more favorable light."
BritishTV,38uqcq,goodintent,3,Mon Jun 8 23:10:57 2015 UTC,"I used to find her annoying but I don't mind her now. Not entirely sure why. I can see why she would grate on some, though."
BritishTV,38uqcq,Jammypotatoes,5,Sun Jun 7 18:54:22 2015 UTC,she's jeremy clarkson for wimmin. which should give you some indication of how awful clarkson really is.

I disagree violently with most of his opinions, even on TG, but, somehow, I don't really mind watching him. I have never really understood that. He is like an old friend whose racist jokes you ignore, because you are used to hanging out with him."
BritishTV,38uqcq,timingandscoring,2,Sun Jun 7 16:04:48 2015 UTC,"ha. wow. that was so aptly and accurately described. aside from that, I think he has genuine screen charisma (something intangible) and a decent enough comedy sensibility to make him incredibly watchable."

BritishTV,386xp7,obliviious,7,Tue Jun 2 09:06:12 2015 UTC,I think sky hd is only 720p with lots of compression

BritishTV,386xp7,persona876,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:06:05 2015 UTC,"That's definitely not true for a lot of their programming. Nevertheless, it's shocking that it happens at all considering it's one of their flagship shows, it beggars belief they would present it so poorly."
BritishTV,386xp7,WG47,2,Tue Jun 2 09:13:35 2015 UTC,"Definitely something I've noticed, they broadcast in 1080i I believe but it honestly seems so much worse than say BBC HD broadcasts. I remember being shocked at the difference going from Sky Atlantic to a blu-ray of Mad Men. Strange."
BritishTV,386xp7,persona876,4,Tue Jun 2 12:52:14 2015 UTC,"Not strange really, the resolution doesn't matter if you use a shitty low bitrate that can't carry the detail. You'll end up with reduced detail and blockiness, especially in dark scenes.  I download GoT each week and I usually wait for the BATV 1080p because it's recorded from a feed that has a high enough bitrate to do the content justice."

BritishTV,386xp7,bacon_cake,4,Tue Jun 2 18:46:56 2015 UTC,1080i shouldn't be an issue. That's all the Sky box can output anyway. The problem as others have said appears to be really shit compression or some other mistake in encoding the feed.
BritishTV,386xp7,BaBaFiCo,6,Tue Jun 2 18:50:31 2015 UTC,Studied film production at university. Spent a long time on learning the acceptable parameters of lighting etc for television. GoT would fail. Far too dark. It's ridiculous. I was worried my TV was set up wrong but other shows that are dark don't even come close.
BritishTV,386xp7,oneonetwooneonetwo,6,Tue Jun 2 13:14:06 2015 UTC,When I see the set photos from GoT I feel so disappointed for everyone who designed the sets and costumes. They're absolutely  beautiful but the show seems to be filmed in such darkness they might as well spend half the time.
BritishTV,386xp7,twersx,5,Tue Jun 2 10:02:54 2015 UTC,"Is it the show though or is it the broadcast? It doesn't even seem to be that dark. It's just that there seems to be poor compression and the colours are 'off'. I'm sure I've seen episodes of the show in the past that are as dark as some of the scenes in this series but you could still see everything fine.  It kind of has the hallmarks of someone completely screwing up the conversions from Full and Limited RGB. Like it's gone from Limited to Full, had colours culled, then gone back to Limited."
BritishTV,386xp7,lamby,6,Tue Jun 2 20:45:39 2015 UTC,"Possibly. It's been like it in a few episodes for me though, particularly the ones involving Arya. Almost total blackness."

BritishTV,386xp7,CaptainDjango,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:47:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's the lighting though, I think it's something else. I downloaded a 6GB copy of a recent episode and it simply looks bad all the way through.  From my experience of trying to rip the bluray of Aliens, I think they've filmed it with too much grain so they can't compress it to a reasonable file size without losing loads of detail. Aliens was shot with film that resulted in a lot of graining or noise in the image. That's fine when your file size can be 35GB, not so much when you have to transmit it over the air or the internet."

BritishTV,37xg5p,docb30tn,16,Sun May 31 05:16:12 2015 UTC,"Try these out!   Utopia - Conspiracy story about a group of forum dwellers that have nothing else in common, that obsess over an obscure graphic novel. They find out the graphic novel is more than just a story and are forced into hiding by a murderous organisation. Happy Valley - A small town police force deals with a big crime, headed by the only competent officer. Meanwhile, someone she put away a long time ago is headed back into town. I would not refer to this as ""female drama"" that you wanted to avoid. The main character happens to be a woman, and a seriously capable hero of this show (think Broadchurch's Miller). Line of Duty - The only honest cop in a botched anti-terrorism operation is seconded to internal affairs. His first target is the Police Officer of the Year. What Remains - A retiring detective refuses to stop investigating a mystery he encounters on his last day at work: the decayed remains of a young woman found in the attic of her own apartment building, never reported missing. The detective discovers what lies under the surface of the building's other tenants. Misfits - Chavs with super powers. Very watchable for most of its five series run. The powers are far from Earth shattering but just enough to make the cast's life miserable. They constantly encounter people who were also granted powers, some of them with devious plans on how to use them Being Human - A ghost, a vampire and a werewolf live together. Surprisingly not a comedy, and created by Doctor Who alum Toby Whithouse. Outcasts - Mankind's first offworld colony undergoes a power struggle. Cancelled after first season so might be a bit of a tease. The first episode is a little misleading regarding the tone of the show, but it was worth persisting. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell - One man is determined to return magic to England in the 19th century. On his quest to become the sole magician in England, he encounters a second more charming magician who has very different opinions on the control of magic. Based on the excellent novel by Sussana Clarke. Currently airing on BBC. The Fades - A young man finds he has the ability to see ""ghosts"" (or Fades). The Fades are no longer ""moving on"" from the living world, and have a plan to reclaim their lives that must be stopped. Edge of Darkness - Somewhat older than the rest of the list, a noir thriller about a cop whose daughter is shot and dies in his arms. While investigating who attempted to kill him, he discovers he may not have been the intended target. Remade into a movie with Mel Gibson some years ago, the original is superior. Possibly Joe Don Baker's best role as an slightly mad American interloper who may be the only person the cop can trust. I, Claudius - Much older than the rest of this list, this is essential viewing if you enjoy UK drama. It's like Game of Thrones but based on true events in the Roman Empire (so no dragons or white walkers). It features a stellar cast and some rather shocking developments from history. Interestingly, HBO and BBC2 were working on remake this with Jane Tranter at the helm. It's been a while since any news on the project surfaced though."

Surely if it's just 'hard work' that gets people to the top, It would be nice for the public to see a typical day of a builder, plumber, single mother, high level banker, shares trader, politician, home carer, NHS nurse, mix it up a bit.  ""participants would be paid a compensatory figure ânot below the national minimum wageâ for the length of their contribution to the programme.""

BritishTV,37i7jk,leonryan,10,Thu May 28 00:54:16 2015 UTC,"Probably not, they see it as a chance to win money and get on telly, the same as the delusional people on singing shows who can't sing for shit and are there for everyone else's amusement.  It's more about how the people watching will regard them and other ""poor"" people. Have you seen the twitter comments when Benefits Street is on? It's disgusting."
BritishTV,37i7jk,WG47,2,Thu May 28 01:00:45 2015 UTC,"this doesn't sound like pure poverty porn though.  this sounds like an attempt to show that they're not all benefit cheats but some are actually hard workers.  i have family members who are great examples of ""salt of the earth"" people.  honest hardworking people who for whatever reason just never achieve any real success.  i think those people deserve to be exposed to counter the general opinion that poor people are typically trash."
BritishTV,37i7jk,leonryan,9,Thu May 28 01:03:32 2015 UTC,"It's still making them dance for our amusement. Nobody who's not a complete cunt thinks the majority of poor people are lazy benefits cheats.  The point you think it's trying to make is a point that doesn't need made, and at the same time it'll reinforce stereotypes because they'll be ""the good ones"".  It won't change anyone's mind."
BritishTV,37i7jk,WG47,3,Thu May 28 01:13:48 2015 UTC,"everyone on tv is dancing for our amusement.  I'm A Celebrity is the same thing, it's just that there's a savage joy in watching the rich and famous eat horse shit and beetles."
BritishTV,37i7jk,leonryan,6,Thu May 28 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"Doing OK and used to be famous, perhaps.  And no, not all TV is exploitative. That's the difference. The people on I'm a Celeb were booked on there by their agents. The exposure is worth more to them than any prize, and while they're perhaps not as busy as they once were, they're not going to go hungry. Not so with the poor who'll be in this BBC show.  I did wonder though, who can afford to go on this show? Plenty of people don't get paid holidays, and if you're signing on you'd have to sign off for the duration since you won't be actively looking for work."

BritishTV,37i7jk,KarmaUK,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:18:28 2015 UTC,"There's a very very strong slant from The Independent here though. Personally I think it's a little bit different from the Hunger Games. Unless they're going to randomly pick 24 teenagers and have them fight to the death that is.  Not really too different from ""Britain's got Talent"" or ""The apprentice"" (except that one's effectively limited to the middle classes). It's all about the slant. One person's ""exploiting the desperate"" is another's ""giving poor people a shot"".   Personally I think it's going to be the sort of rubbish I really hate, but I'm hardly the target demographic. I think some people will enjoy it because they genuinely root for a guy they relate to. Much as it may surprise The Independent, even poor people have televisions these days."

BritishTV,37bkph,atomicforest,17,Tue May 26 12:53:42 2015 UTC,I believe Simon has said in various ways that he feels bad or something like that about those days.

BritishTV,37bkph,maebyher,9,Tue May 26 18:30:53 2015 UTC,"Did he feel bad about it because he was so harsh or because it ended up working against him?

BritishTV,37bkph,atomicforest,12,Tue May 26 18:35:44 2015 UTC,"from what I remember, he felt bad for making people upset and then in turn how they felt about him.

BritishTV,37bkph,DaLateDentArthurDent,22,Tue May 26 15:30:31 2015 UTC,"The answer is in the linked article:  âIt struck me with Simon that people were being booked especially to have the piss taken out of them in a very overt fashion,â Jupitus said in a Guardian interview in 2010.  âMark [Lamarr] didnât book people to rag on them, it was just in the flow of the show that people suddenly went a bit weird and Mark could turn on them.

BritishTV,374osx,wrigleyirish,3,Wed May 27 15:33:08 2015 UTC,"Whew, I was relieved. Surprisingly, it's really good!  I've read the book many times, and listened to the audio book many more, so if anyone was going to be a tough sell for this adaptation, it'd be me. But it won me over, making me feel the same feelings the book gave me in a few scenes -- possibly because the dialogue is almost completely the same. It's pretty amazing how much Childermass sounds exactly* like I imagined. So, I consider it a pretty huge success, considering the obstacles I had to enjoying this.   While some changes did bother me (one BIG one which I'll elaborate on), others are perfectly understandable. The dry humor was stripped of many scenes, because I imagine it couldn't be conveyed well. A lot of the comedy in the book relies on internal dialogue.   Among the changes that bothered me, the actor for Norrell comes across as far too assertive for who he's meant to be portraying. Anyone familiar with the books will spot this the moment he takes the screen. it feels a bit like the actor taking liberties for a more compelling on-screen performance, when really the person he's supposed to be portraying is like a banker or librarian. However, he does nail some of the nuance of his character -- namely that he's not only a recluse, he's something of an autistic; socially inept. Both incapable of reading people's social cues and effectively communicating with them. These are mostly comical traits, but it also grounds his character.   And the big one: they've made a bold change to the fairy, to the extent that it may as well be a different character altogether. If you added up the character traits of the book's fairy, you'd get arrogant, conceited, proud, jovial and of course cheerful to the point of sinister. A guy who would just as soon laugh at you as wipe you from the face of the earth. The show's fairy doesn't carry any of those traits. While he is indeed otherworldly, he just comes across as a boomy-voiced bad guy. No more personality nuance, or cheery and politely evil demeanor. Apparently just a straight-up villain. At the least, it'll be interesting to see how they carry that moving forward in certain scenes, since it's by far the biggest change to the fundamentals.  This is unfortunate, because of all the elements of the book, I've always felt his character would be the most interesting to see on-screen, because he's so animated and delightfully evil. Now he's just a dry, boring, evil guy with crazy hair.  Example from the book: âHow long is a life?â he asked. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair spread his hands in a gesture of the utmost candour.  âHow long would you like?â.  From the show:  âHow long is a life?â  The gentleman asks dead-pan, not looking at Norrell at all: âHow long would you like?â  Anyway, I hope it does well, if anything for the author. She deserves it."
BritishTV,374osx,drcanislupus,5,Tue May 26 17:29:32 2015 UTC,"Big fan of the book.  I've read it multiple times.  So far the show has down well to capture the vibe. I always felt that Dickens movies fell short in this department because,  like Susanna Clarke, the joy of the writing (sentence structure, word choice, and flow) can't be overstated and doesn't always translate to the screen. So far it's been quite good and I'm hoping they will be able to maintain the high quality levels."

BritishTV,3722j7,officialdoughboy,1 point,Sun May 24 08:56:21 2015 UTC,"Like has been said it's probably My Family.  I think My Family got so much criticism because it was an American production on British TV.  The creator of the show was American and was known for Caroline in the City, Dave's World, etc.  If you look at the list of episodes - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_My_Family_episodes you'll see how many writers they used, which is not typical of a British production.   In 1999, Fred Barron was considering producing a British sitcom the same way sitcoms were produced in the U.S.. My Family was to feature a group of writers rather than the standard one or two, something that had been attempted in UK with shows including Goodnight Sweetheart and On the Buses, but was nevertheless atypical. My Family was consciously designed to have wide appeal, with characters with whom viewers would be able to build a relationship in the same way as previous BBC sitcom 2point4 Children which focuses around a similar family unit. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Family   The only other show it could be is 2point4 Children, which would have been in re-runs at that point, since it was a 90s show.  Here's an episode - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs6ti_BkCU0"
BritishTV,3722j7,Rhyxnathotho,1 point,Sun May 24 18:04:15 2015 UTC,Maybe Lead Balloon? I think it was on a bit later but it was a great show and I vaguely remember a plot line that involved the main character's daughter/daughter's boyfriend getting a tattoo. Fantastic show nonetheless!

BBC has an open unlimited license with the major music labels that does not extend to its corporate cousin BBC America.

There's also a radio show version which is good iirc. The Red Dwarf audiobooks (read by some of the TV show's cast) are also really good, they'll make a long journey fly by.   Edit: thought of some more.  If it hasn't been mentioned already.. Chris Barrie had his own sitcom called The Brittas Empire. Can't really comment on it's quality, but it was definitely no Red Dwarf.  & Norman Lovett, who played Holly, acted an odd little gem of a sitcom set in an asylum. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123341/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast It was directed by Edgar Wright, includes several of the Spaced cast along with several other future stars of British TV comedy."
BritishTV,36nevm,lordriffington,2,Wed May 20 22:00:52 2015 UTC,"Chris Barrie (Rimmer) is insanely good at doing impressions of the rest of the cast. He's recorded at least one of the audiobooks.  Also, OP seems to want comedy, so the Hitchhiker's Guide movie probably won't help."
BritishTV,36nevm,okem,2,Wed May 20 22:17:37 2015 UTC,"Yer, the movie isn't great. The TV show is probably pretty dated but still good and the radio show is a well made representation of the books.   Chris Barrie is just all round pretty awesome IMHO."

BritishTV,36hxhb,wasteman1234,4,Tue May 19 14:50:40 2015 UTC,"I'm Swedish and watched all of it when it was on the Danish equivalent of iPlayer.  One complaint I have was that I felt it was more of a family drama set in war times rather than a good history lesson of what took place in the war. That's all well and good but then don't call it 1864 - because that reference is all war to the Danes.  I think the first episode is a bit scattered in that the skipping between now and then is chopping things up more than tying things together - but that gets better later on. And of course there is alot of character introduction which makes it somewhat tedious.  Watch episodes 1+2 in one go. Bow out if you don't like it after the 3rd, by then I'd say it's fully set up.  To me, the most interesting character is Johan Larsen (fellow soldier but older and wiser than the brothers), doesn't appear until ep 3.  I really like that they made a good effort to add in the glimpes of German and English perspective of the politics.  The scene with the spunk jar just left me smirking and shaking my head at the typical Danishness of having such a scene in this supposed national epic tale."

BritishTV,36d1i4,listyraesder,3,Mon May 18 17:01:41 2015 UTC,"It's weird you say it wasn't action packed because I actually felt their was quite a lot of it for a pilot, we get the impressive display of magic early on and then bringing someone back from the dead with a creepy otherworldly figure and a blood pact, found it quite exciting and not slow at all. Plus their was so much humour and fun in all the characters, nice to see a period drama not take itself too seriously."

My main beef is the lack of decent women characters, and the trope of eager young man going to ridiculous lengths to get a pretty woman to notice him is tired, old and lazy writing. Disappointed in the characters- all white men except for a token black man and a couple of two dimensional women who only seemed to reinforce the AWALT mentality. Hopefully it will improve because I do like the genre. Maybe I have been spoiled by Wolf Hall and Poldark."

I set it up a while ago so can't remember exactly, but you tell it the tracker to use (I use kickass), whether you want hd or sd (don't use 'any' otherwise I found it downloaded multiple versions), and your torrent client. I think there are some other things to set up. When a torrent hits kickass it will automatically download the files."

It will automatically check your torrent sites for you, download the torrent file and add it to your torrent client, and if you hook it up to the pushbullet API then it'll also send a notification to your phone. So you don't get a notification when a new show starts, but rather you get a notification each time a new episode of your show is downloaded and waiting for you. You have to compile a list of all your favorite shows, but then you're done. And all of this is free, except for renting a seedbox, but you could also just run it on your home computer.  You could also probably use IFTTT to do something similar, but I'm not expert on that.  EDIT:  If you're lazy or not tech literate, you can just use this - http://episodecalendar.com/ - It doesn't do notifications, but it has a calendar you can reference.

Right now they save a lot of money by restricting the service to UK IP addresses and hoping that anyone in the UK who is using it is hopefully a licence fee payer.  But to extend that to the entire EU would require them to get a list of every IP address used by every EU ISP, perform lots of network engineering to handle any new load created from non-UK users, and some sort of authentication to ensure that only licence fee payers can get on. (within the UK they connect directly to the ISPs, similar to the peering deals that have caused outrage in the US except the BBC doesn't pay for it)  They'd also have to pay for EU rights to music or content that currently they only pay for the UK/Ireland/Belgium/Netherlands (these are the countries that get the BBC officially)  It's the sort of work that the BBC would already have done if practical and feasible and a potential money maker."

Its name comes from the postcode prefix of the BBC's headquarters, Broadcasting House (W1A 1AA),  and sees the reprisal of Hugh Bonneville and Jessica Hynes as their Twenty Twelve characters, alongside a new cast, with David Tennant's role as narrator also continuing from the earlier series. The first series began on the 19 March, concluding on the 9 April 2014. A second series was announced later in 2014 which launched on 23 April 2015 with a one hour special.

Two teaser scenes:  From the first episode, explaining what intelligence really means to an overeager Norwegian diplomat whose agents had to be rescued by the Sandbaggers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww5Ko6Fiq5s  A second scene, showing how even for intelligence agents, being sent out to the field is never something you desire to do. It's dangerous and get's very messy very quickly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTI1RJw1jWM  If you can get used to the slow pace, it's a very tense show. No tense music, very few action scenes, but lot's of drama and politics."
BritishTV,35wa3t,AndorianBlues,1 point,Fri May 15 22:07:30 2015 UTC,"Great one. Fantastic show. As much about inter-departmental politics as about the cold war. Most of the time is spent in offices and meetings, answering phones, etc, and is somehow absolutely riveting."

BritishTV,35tco7,oddgoat,2,Wed May 13 10:21:54 2015 UTC,I've watched the first two episodes and I'm not feeling it. As a comedy it isn't funny enough and as a drama it isn't engaging enough. Lots of leading female characters is a plus though.

BritishTV,35li18,PMalternativs2reddit,4,Mon May 11 18:22:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly I found this pretty disappointing. There was too much time spent simply recalling moments from the election - the stone pledges, Cameron's football team gaffe. This show is so much better than a 'Top 10 Best Bits From Election 2015' roundup but I think Brooker is really struggling to expand the shows horizons for some reason.  Finding that Labour stole the 'Triple Lock' phrase from the Tory's was a damn good find. I'd have preferred 30 mins of just content like that, with an Adam Curtis segment in there too (why oh WHY haven't there been more Adam Curtis segments? Anything will do, just play clips from his latest film, anything!) That would help bring the show back to how good it was when it was Newswipe on BBC4.  Its just so sad because its really obvious what's happening, Brooker's acerbic tone being diluted and blunted now he's on BBC2. But I'm sure he could go to another channel and stay true to himself, that's what I think he should do."

Prior to broadcast it was trailed as The Harry Enfield Show.  The show reunites the pair, who had success with Harry Enfield's Television Programme in the 1990s.   The second series of the programme began on BBC One on 5 September 2008. This was the last series from the comedy producer Geoffrey Perkins who died shortly before the programme's second series began.  A third series was commissioned and began 28 September 2010 this time on BBC Two to where the show has been moved, because of falling ratings.

BritishTV,355vdj,avisitorfrom,2,Sat May 9 03:46:45 2015 UTC,"I watched it last night on iPlayer and didn't like it. There were funny segments, but bashing Paxton and other journalists felt weak. Criticism and satire is hilarious if there's meat in the arguments, and Brooker's arguments felt hollow. It might be due to the lack of time given for an episode, or something else I'm missing."
BritishTV,355vdj,KarmaUK,3,Fri May 8 03:22:20 2015 UTC,"I think he said himself it was made far more difficult due to rules about 'balance', especially when you've got clowns like UKIP dropping clangers every couple of days and you have to give the other parties a similar level of derisive banter.  for what it's worth, I think he was quite fair, and Farage came out quite well, but yeah, perhaps it'd have been better without him being restrained like that."

BritishTV,356d0s,NotFaux,2,Thu May 7 17:00:30 2015 UTC,"I keep feeling that the real issue with BBC3 is that it's targeted towards young people, but has been slowly been moving their focus to even younger folk (like secondary school kids) which means their content is getting progressively more silly, mix that with the fact that people who liked BBC3 a few years ago are also getting older and they're in for a really hard sell on most shows.  Murder In Successville looked absolutely garbage when they were advertising it, but I just caught the end of the first episode and it actually looks funny as fuck and really unique too."
BritishTV,356d0s,Explore411,1 point,Mon May 11 01:30:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I liked the idea and found it quite original as well. On 5 live the guy who wrote said the Deborah Meaden (dragon's den) episode is really good.

BritishTV,34y5zi,jinku2608,5,Tue May 5 17:31:11 2015 UTC,Top Gear started in the '70s. Clarkson arrived in the late '80s/early-'90s.

BritishTV,34y5zi,Mr_Bigguns,10,Tue May 5 15:18:26 2015 UTC,"It depends on what the format of the new series is. I would think that it almost certainly won't be anything like the Clarkson/Hammond/May version of Top Gear.   If it was more in the format more like like, for example, Countryfile, then the chemistry doesn't have to be that close as they won't be on screen much together. Of course in time it will develop as will their rapport. Remember that the original line up of the most recent version didn't include James May"
BritishTV,34y5zi,Scary_,5,Tue May 5 16:48:45 2015 UTC,That sounds just like Top Gear used to be waaaaay back in time

BritishTV,34y5zi,ablebodiedmango,9,Wed May 6 00:27:38 2015 UTC,"It won't be Jeremy Clarkson's Top Gear.  You do realize it was a show before he was on it right?  Maybe it was the most popular iteration, but it wasn't his show.  It was the BBC's show.  It was the license payer's show."
BritishTV,34y5zi,DirtyOldFrank,1 point,Tue May 5 18:16:15 2015 UTC,"You do realize it was a show before he was on it right?   Of course, but ask anyone about Top Gear and you know what they'll say.   It died a horrible death around the turn of the century and was completely revamped shortly after. It's this very latest iteration people will remember, even though I'm still a big fan of Tiff, Quentin and VB-H.  Regardless of our opinions of the latest presenters, it's their chemistry that's made it what it is for the millions who now associate with it."
BritishTV,34y5zi,mobiuszeroone,1 point,Tue May 5 18:19:25 2015 UTC,"Right, and now there's a new group coming in - whoever it is - who may have worse or the same or better chemistry.

BritishTV,34y5zi,ablebodiedmango,0,Tue May 5 18:27:49 2015 UTC,What did people expect was going to eventually happen   Nobody had to think about that until now. That's why a new line-up is being debated with people voicing their opinions.  That would be like speculating over the presenting team of Question Time. Nobody gives a toss until it happens.
BritishTV,34y5zi,DirtyOldFrank,1 point,Tue May 5 18:36:14 2015 UTC,"That's true, yeah, but when people think of Top Gear they think of those three, not the show before 2002. I don't even know what the show looked like before Jeremy was on, and I'm sure most of the current viewership don't either."
BritishTV,34y5zi,ablebodiedmango,8,Tue May 5 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"Well, this may come as a shock, but people get older and something that was around 17 years ago may not be familiar to anyone now.   It may also be surprising to know that people get over that and adapt to change, and it's not the first time that a franchise has changed heads.     The way this is made out to be is that Clarkson did this all on his own, and didn't have an entire company and hundreds of millions of pounds and producers and directors and actors and - most importantly - the cars and the people who made them behind him.  The even more tragic aspect is that nobody wants to blame Clarkson for it.  Want to be angry at someone?  Be angry at the man who caused his own dismissal and destruction of the ""Top Gear as you know it.""    He's not on the show anymore.  He won't be on the show any more.  He shouldn't be on the show anymore given his actions.  And the show will go on.  Just because it's not ""his"" Top Gear doesn't mean it isn't Top Gear."
BritishTV,34y5zi,mobiuszeroone,0,Tue May 5 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"The even more tragic aspect is that nobody wants to blame Clarkson for it.   Yeah, you lost it there. You've let your utter disdain for Clarkson get in the way of what could have been a reasonable point.   Most of us have moved on from Clarkson because he made a complete cock of it and an arse of himself. You're being left behind."
BritishTV,34y5zi,Scary_,1 point,Tue May 5 18:33:07 2015 UTC,"Really? My point wasn't made?  How about this one -    The way this is made out to be is that Clarkson did this all on his own, and didn't have an entire company and hundreds of millions of pounds and producers and directors and actors and - most importantly - the cars and the people who made them behind him.   Or did you just want to conveniently ignore that part?  More importantly, what are you complaining of here?  That ""Top Gear"" won't be the same?  Well no fucking shit.  It won't be the same.  What exactly did you expect would happen?  What are you lamenting if you're acknowledging how Clarkson created this mess?    If anything I think the show will better without his narcissism and self-indulgence as a distraction.  It will be fun again.  Top Gear will stop being a standard-bearer for institutionalized bullying.  It will stop being a headache (even if not as much as a money earner) for the BBC.  What's more, it brings in a new generation of people who aren't stuck in the ""we hate anything that Jeremy Clarskon hates"" mentality.  So what's the problem?"
BritishTV,34y5zi,Echelon64,0,Tue May 5 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"When I say ""Clarkson"" I mean the show with him and the other two, he was often shown as the ""main"" presenter. I never said that Clarkson single-handedly created the last format of the show.    The way this is made out to be   By who? Who says that he made the whole thing? There is no tragedy here, plenty of people want to blame Clarkson for it. There's no need to assume that I'm angry at anyone because I said that the 2002-2015 Top Gear won't be ""Top Gear"".  ""Top Gear"" made millions and is apparently the most watched show on the world, all I'm saying is agreeing with the OP that the new format, or any format before the previous one, will be dwarfed by the 2002-2015 run so it's fair to say that the new one won't be ""Top Gear"", because those three and the team made an entire brand out of a little motoring show."

BritishTV,34y5zi,ablebodiedmango,1 point,Wed May 6 10:26:24 2015 UTC,"Their success will be very tough to repeat.  It's a tall order for these three new presenters to last a whole decade and have a similar success to the late Top Gear. Obviously if they do that, they will become bigger and more recognizable, but to say that they could top that success and worldwide likability is optimistic at best. That's why I'm presuming that the 2002-2015 show will be ""the"" Top Gear for a long time."

And if you actually watched the Tesla review besides getting your opinion from /r/technology he praised the fucking electrified Lotus Elise and only harped on about the recharge time (which he was correct, it takes about 16 hours to charge without a supercharger).   He hated foreigners   You mean the guy who traveled half the planet? Please. He poked fun at immigrants, that's not hating.   He hated women.   What?

BritishTV,34gadf,Mr_Bigguns,3,Fri May 1 09:13:39 2015 UTC,"Threads:       Threads is a 1984 BAFTA award-winning British television drama, produced jointly by the BBC, Nine Network and Western-World Television Inc. Written by Barry Hines and directed by Mick Jackson, it is a docudrama account of nuclear war and its effects on the city of Sheffield in Northern England.  The primary plot centres on two families, the working-class Kemps and the middle-class Becketts, as a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union erupts and escalates. As the United Kingdom prepares for war, the members of each family deal with their own personal crises. Meanwhile, a secondary plot centred upon the Chief Executive of Sheffield City Council serves to illustrate the British government's then-current continuity of government arrangements. As nuclear exchanges between NATO and the Warsaw Pact begin, the harrowing details of the characters' struggle to survive the attacks and their aftermath is dramatically depicted. The balance of the story details the fate of each family as the characters face the medical, economic, social and environmental consequences of nuclear war.  Shot on a budget of Â£250,000â350,000, the film was notable in being the first of its kind to depict a nuclear winter. Certain reviewers have nominated Threads as the ""film which comes closest to representing the full horror of nuclear war and its aftermath, as well as the catastrophic impact that the event would have on human culture"". It has been compared to the earlier programme The War Game produced in Britain in the 1960s and its contemporary The Day After, a 1983 ABC television film depicting a similar scenario in the United States.

One of my favourite episodes of the whole show.  particularly liked pemberton's character - had me in stitches.  shame there may not be any more, here's hoping for another season. It's a great conduit for the two's writing and acting abilities.  still, League, Psychoville and now this - i imagine they will be able to do someting terrific again even if this is not renewed."

BritishTV,347ec6,HeartyBeast,2,Tue Apr 28 22:01:10 2015 UTC,Really interesting documentary with the big players in BBC TV explaining the genesis of the big Saturday Night shows.
BritishTV,3453vi,heavymoon,5,Tue Apr 28 11:13:41 2015 UTC,"Grange Hill aired after school on Australia's public broadcaster, ABC, throughout the eighties. It was later replaced by Degrassi from Canada, ending up on Nickelodeon for the remainder of its run. I'm not sure any local networks were still running it when it finally ended. I do recall seeing classic storylines like Zammo's drug problem and Danny Kendall's fate.  This show (along with the comic School Fun) gave me a strange view of what school was like for British kids during the 1980s. Apparently all of your schools not only had lunches cooked on site, an alien concept at my school, but also their own swimming pools, a roaring heroin trade, and violent students (and Bronson) tormenting unwitting victims.  I was also watching Prisoner Cell Block H at a remarkably young age back then. Grange Hill frequently looked like a scarier place than Wentworth."
BritishTV,3453vi,Gnorris,2,Wed Apr 29 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"Never had a swimming pool but school lunches were definitely cooked at the school. Where else would hey be cooked?   And yes, most people would prefer to be in prison than school again."
BritishTV,3453vi,wOlfLisK,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:53:03 2015 UTC,"The fact that the school provided any lunch, and you weren't bringing a packed lunch from home, was a foreign concept to me until Grange Hill."
BritishTV,3453vi,Gnorris,2,Thu Apr 30 00:52:31 2015 UTC,"Ahaha, well the truth is school was more like this episode than the latter episodes of Grange Hill. I always say the first four seasons of Grange Hill capture London school life perfectly, while the later seasons act as more of a soap opera. That's no complaint though, the other seasons are still great especially the Zammo season."
BritishTV,3453vi,purplesaturn,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:24:45 2015 UTC,"Schools didn't generally have their own pools; the class would all get on a bus and go to the nearest public swimming pool. Coincidentally, the nearest in my case was also the coldest and grottiest. This was a time of life where you would actually be thrilled to get a verruca, as that meant you weren't allowed in the pool and would have to stay in the viewing area eating Monster Munch."
BritishTV,3453vi,FlappySocks,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:02:41 2015 UTC,"My school had a small pool, but it was never used due to the heater never working. It took them 10 years or so to find out a builder hammered a nail through the electricity cable.  I think it's been filled in now. Heath & safety."

BritishTV,3453vi,tomutwit,1 point,Wed Apr 29 10:01:24 2015 UTC,"I believe it was a continuation! Tucker, the character in this series, guest starred. The show aired thirty seasons before it was eventually cancelled in 2008.  The first series of Grange Hill was very much a show about Tucker and his group of friends causing mischief. The second series began the more hard hitting storylines and focused on other characters."
BritishTV,3453vi,mappsy91,2,Wed Apr 29 12:22:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah thought so. I remember seeing episodes where it often felt like Casualty for kids or something. Like one where a guy put his hand up a girls shirt while kissing and she said she ""didn't want to take it so quickly"" or something."

BritishTV,344zyq,Awaise,2,Tue Apr 28 10:17:56 2015 UTC,I watched 20 minutes of it and turned off. The CGI and the acting seemed fairly dodgy. Shall I push on through?
BritishTV,344zyq,gelectrox,2,Tue Apr 28 11:53:34 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about the first episode, then absolutely. I thought the CGI and fake bodies were damn realistic, although in hindsight, I know what you mean about the acting. There isn't much in the way of character development, and everyone is tense pretty much all the time, but I'd suggest giving the first few episodes a shot and let all the characters introduce themselves. If you do give it another chance, I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on the show!"

Is each episode effectively standalone? And how does it compare to Bodies?"
BritishTV,344zyq,GroundDweller,2,Tue Apr 28 18:55:57 2015 UTC,"This is still a shock to me but I've never actually gotten around to seeing Bodies, so I can't compare.  The episodes aren't entirely standalone no; whilst each episode revolves around an individual patient, there is a developing storyline between some of the characters. But on an ep-by-ep basis, the continuity doesn't take up much of the episode, so you can effectively watch a random episode and not have it completely ruined by not knowing what some of the characters conversations are about."

BritishTV,33tokj,solidfox535,7,Sat Apr 25 18:13:56 2015 UTC,Very different but I still enjoyed it a lot. It felt like Shearsmith and Pemberton making a Mike Leigh film.
BritishTV,33tokj,Joelwba,7,Sat Apr 25 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"I loved the way they played with the expectation of the knife in the head, and there was a lovely contrast between farce and serious business at the end. I thought this was the most smartly written one so far this series."
BritishTV,33tokj,harbourwall,3,Sat Apr 25 20:41:11 2015 UTC,"I liked it, quite funny, though it wasn't close to macabre as every other episode is.  The witch trial one was the worst this series IMO."
BritishTV,33tokj,Disgruntled__Goat,2,Sat Apr 25 19:07:08 2015 UTC,"It was the first time i caught it so because I had no other episode to compare it too, i really enjoyed it"
BritishTV,33tokj,Mr_Bigguns,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:21:06 2015 UTC,"I guess the big feature for this episode was to twist expectations and tease it like a horror episode again, but it felt Shamyalanesque in that the twist was quite unexpected but not all that good. Turns into this somewhat convoluted family drama that is shoe horned in a few minutes at the end.   Certainly the weakest of  the series, at least the witch trial one had some hilarious bits like the witch blowing the town Smith and the satire of modern celebrity scandals. I think they plan the order of the series like this so the weakest ones disappear in the middle."
BritishTV,33tokj,ablebodiedmango,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:57:21 2015 UTC,The London No.9 bus route from Hammersmith to Aldwych would make an interesting episode.
BritishTV,33tokj,globaldu,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:32:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely the weakest of this series.  Mind you, it was about this time last series that they showed the weakest one (balloon) - make of that what you will.  I assume they order the episodes based on strength - start and finish strong, put the weaker ones in the middle."
BritishTV,33tokj,oddgoat,10,Sat Apr 25 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I enjoyed this episode a little less than the others, but I felt the witch trial one was the weakest in this series. otherwise, this series has been pretty great. there are 2 more left this series right?"
BritishTV,33tokj,stephenhawkingruns,2,Sat Apr 25 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"Witch trial was indeed weak, but I think it had more humour in it than nan's party.  The twist of the witch trial episode was weakest, but overall I enjoyed it more than nan's party.  There's one more episode left - and PSA, it's on Wednesday, not Thursday."
BritishTV,33tokj,oddgoat,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:45:56 2015 UTC,The witch trial was at least funnier. This one was kind of lacking in humor or suspense

(If you're old-ish - I'm 45 and it made me laugh and even cry a bit.)  Funny and touching moments if you have ever had to commute to work by car with a stranger of the opposite sex, with the radio on so that there are no awkward silences...  Maybe less interesting if you haven't."
BritishTV,33rzqh,miraoister,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:31:20 2015 UTC,"Just watched the first episode, I don't know if I'll rush to watch the rest (I have other things I'd rather be watching before it), but I enjoyed it well enough. It was pretty paint by numbers in terms of the writing, but it managed to come across as nice/cute toward the end of the episode, as they slowly warmed to each other, learned more about each other.   I also enjoyed the radio station in the background, with their little adverts, etc."
