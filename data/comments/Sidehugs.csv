It's a far cry from places like /r/atheist, /r/atheismrebooted, /r/openchristian,  anywhere /u/emprags frequents, and /r/onetruegod where Christians are repeatedly mocked for their beliefs. This subreddit truly is amazing and has changed my outlook on several doctrinal and personal issues. I want to thank all the atheists who post here and contribute to the diversity of this subreddit. In particular I want to thank /u/zeroempathy, just now, who posted this great question which I'm sure will generate fascinating discussion. I would also like to thank myself, for thanking all the atheists, and for contributing to this subreddit's friendly atmosphere. I would also like to thank Jesus, my morning tea, and the tasty Chinese food I had last night. I want to thank all the subscribers who pointed me to all the NT Wright books that I have squandered my savings on. I want to thank Stacy, who even though she rejected me last night, will surely come around eventually so long as I exhibit Christ-like patience. And of course Ellen Pao gets a mention for not banning this subreddit. This place is amazing and I look forward to more enlightening questions from honest atheists in the future. Good night, and good luck."
