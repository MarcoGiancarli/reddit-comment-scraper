Suffice it to say the arranger takes some risks in the area of range for several parts, risks which I would be very hesitant to take. Kudos to whatever group performs this well."

acappella,3dfxmr,easyTRASH,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:29:09 2015 UTC,"There are a few problems that need to be addressed. The voice leading is very disjunct. There are times in the soprano where the voice goes from high B down to an E, and then from B to F. Those are very big and akward leaps that don't sound good.   Also, try and make the parts more interesting. Anyone can take a piece of music and arrange it with semibreves (whole notes) throughout the entire song. Try making up little riffs to make it much more interesting for the singers and the listeners"

acappella,3dbwwy,quadmra,0,Wed Jul 15 17:25:45 2015 UTC,Are you referring to the fact that she did the bass in two parts? That was due to the fact that she had to do the two layers in separate layers so that she could transpose the song to minor. But thanks for your feedback!

Having sung in a choir might give you a feel for what you like, but knowing how to actually do proper voice-leading is a whole different level of intimacy with music as a whole. Also, being able to do good voice leading is a half the battle in becoming a good arranger. The second half is experience and knowing the voices you're arranging for."

acappella,3axps4,Blue_Shades,9,Wed Jun 24 09:57:38 2015 UTC,"Nearly all high definition recordings, acapella or not have some sort of tuning. Alot of ""barbershop"" acapella solo multitracks on YouTube use it heavily to get the soprano or bass lines that could be out of their range.   I even imagine people like Peter Hollins probably use it. Though more in the way that Hollywood artists use it."
acappella,3axps4,_halfblood,3,Wed Jun 24 14:11:46 2015 UTC,"I've heard auto-tune used on barbershop videos and I don't like it at all. Good barbershop violates the perfectly tempered scale regularly, which is why the chords ""ring"" so well. Auto-tuned barbershop will never sound as good as the real thing done well because auto-tune confines the sound to the tempered scale and prevents it from ringing like it should.  For solo arrangements, you can get around the problem of certain parts being out of range without auto-tune by pitch-shifting. For example, to get a bass part that is too low for you, pitch-shift the parts you're singing along to up until the bass line is comfortable and record the bass part. Then remove the pitch-shifting from the original parts and pitch-shift the new bass part down by the same amount. Do the reverse for parts that are too high. Try to shift the pitch as little as you can to avoid sounding like you huffed helium or sulfur hexafluoride."
acappella,3axps4,slimindie,0,Wed Jun 24 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"People like Peter Hollins abuse the use of Melodyne. Not so much on the solo (to keep it sounding lifelike) but a LOT on all the background parts. Virtually all professional a cappella use, and frequently overuse, pitch tuning.   Source: I have close friends in the pro a cappella production world and have worked with them in many studios, with many different groups"
acappella,3axps4,treekin,4,Wed Jun 24 20:10:05 2015 UTC,"I think Danny fong (the multitracker) uses it only a slight bit, and he goes through the effects of melodyne (common autotune program) on his channel: https://youtu.be/Jr9TmqUcBVA But I also think a lot of singers try not to. I know Jacob Collier puts in the description of most of his videos ""No autotune/Melodyne used"", though he doesn't seem to be putting it on his latest videos which is kinda interesting. I personally don't mind autotune, I feel it puts a little more emphasis on the writing and preciseness of the piece, rather than the individual performance. Just don't lie about it I guess"
acappella,3axps4,tictoc55,4,Wed Jun 24 13:04:50 2015 UTC,"Pitch correction is everywhere, all the way back to the '90s (and before, albeit in a severely primitive form).  While I'm certain that it's in 90-95% of the tracks you're probably referring to (Peter Hollens, Pentatonix, college groups etc.), I'll give you two examples that I'm 100% certain of, because I worked on them.  Amanda Taylor - Buzzcut Season - No Auto-Tune. Best mix ever? No. Solid performance? Yes.  Street Corner Symphony - Madness - Yes, Auto-Tune. Can you tell? I hope not.

acappella,3axps4,SuspendedFourth,2,Thu Jun 25 15:52:56 2015 UTC,"As everyone seems to be saying, I believe most of the groups that you are probably talking about (excluding obviously untuned live performances) use it. Almost every modern recording does. I think it is quite common to abuse it and rely on the engineer or producer to ""fix"" a bad performance. That kind of mindset leads to a lot of shitty music.    That being said, a lot of people don't use it that way. Groups like Pentatonix and others are very skilled singers that use it to enhance their already great performances. When used as a bit of polish, I think tuning software is great. At this point it's a necessary evil, but most people can tell when the artist actually can't sing."

acappella,3ax1wq,Alamanecer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:12:09 2015 UTC,"Do it if you're comfortable with it, but as a former music director who listened to our set a billion times to arrange it, then practiced it to perfection, I wouldn't purposefully sing a song that they had sung the year before unless you know you can NAIL it.   Pick something that'll show off your range, tone, and talent! You never know where they'll put you in the group!"
acappella,3ax1wq,jessmars,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:42:37 2015 UTC,"Generally no. As a current collegiate director, I want to hear something different from the rest of the crowd, and it is very common to hear former songs being sung by hopeful auditionees. I also don't generally recommend singing anything from the Billboard Top 10 at the time, because again, we hear the same song over and over again and it makes it harder to separate auditionees when they're singing the same song as 20 other people. So yes, as others have said, find something that fits your voice well and you enjoy singing, but choose something you think 10-15 other people aren't also going to choose. Be unique."

acappella,3an4em,Dioxitanium,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:18:14 2015 UTC,"One approach that I like to take arranging is to build up an arrangement, dropping the parts in one by one. I'm not overly familiar with this song, but this seems like that might work pretty well. Here's one way I see of doing it...   I thought of angels  Choking on their halos  Get them drunk on rose water   The soloist could do these lines without any backing. It's a bit of a scary idea, but the lyrics are evocative and the melody is interesting - a rock soloist will pull this off easily.    See how dirty I can get them  Pulling out their fragile teeth  And clip their tiny wings   Enter Bass + VP here. Keep VP to a minimum (e.g. just snare hits on the off beats). At the end of the line VP transitions into their pattern proper with a drum break, during which the song gets going with...   Anything you say can and will be used against you  ...   This is a great place to bring in everyone else - for example, with a nice suspenseful chord pad and/or lyric harmonies diverging from the solo (i.e. going down while solo goes up on ""Anything you say""). And then you get started.   For me one of the hardest, but also most rewarding parts of arranging is figuring out how to make a song work that doesn't make it easy on you. I'd love to hear how you get on with this - please send me a PM at some point with the arrangement, or let me know if you have any further questions."
acappella,3an4em,drehz,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:17:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks a ton!  This is actually going to be a mashup of Just One Yesterday and Rolling in the Deep, and I'll make sure to post the sheet music on the directory when it's done.  I've done a couple of arrangements before - only one one has ever been performed, and it was. . . rough to say the least.  One of the problems with that one was it took way too long to bring everyone in.  My gut feeling was that waiting until that first chorus to bring everyone in would be too long, but looking back at the original, it's a lot faster than I was thinking.    Thank you so much!  I really appreciate the help."
acappella,3an4em,drehz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:51:05 2015 UTC,"Very familiar with that - for every arrangement performed, I've got at least 10 left along the way. It's really important to not lose yourself in the on-screen version - music goes by in a whiz, and it'll probably be less boring than you think when sung by real people. Good luck!"
acappella,3an4em,TangerineX,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:03:11 2015 UTC,"I recommend finding another song to mash it up with to give it a little flavor, so you have two songs to pull ideas from and create something interesting. I recommend something like Young Volcanos."
acappella,3amelm,Calebdgm,3,Sun Jun 21 17:31:22 2015 UTC,"You should really try a little harder to be on pitch, especially with the falsetto"

acappella,3amelm,TangerineX,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:40:26 2015 UTC,"You just can't start off a song being a whole semitone off. Practice with a piano to make sure you're hitting the notes. When you're mixing, it may help to take smaller chunks at a time and then stitch them together. Protip: everyone uses autotune in production. If you REALLY can't do it, use synth voices or find another vocalist. Or, try a composition that is a little bit more forgiving.  Anyways, I think acapella dubstep is possible, but very difficult to pull off. It requires the melody to be extremely on pitch, and a very powerful beatbox/vocal percussion/voxbox part. It would also be extremely difficult to perform live. Props for exploring though!"
acappella,3alkya,hittingal,2,Sun Jun 21 12:12:26 2015 UTC,Pentatonix! They are awesome performers and singers but their arrangements aren't extremely complex from a transcribing perspective. My friends and I have over a dozen and it really wasn't too hard. The harmonies are mostly ones you expect and you can hear each individual line really easily.

acappella,3a8l9t,Pokebunny,5,Thu Jun 18 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm always glad to hear about people getting into a cappella! Well let's get started!  First, listen to as much a cappella as humanly possible! Don't let the groups stop at just Pentatonix or Home Free (Although, I do recommend them both very, very, very strongly!). ""A cappella"" can apply to many different types of singing groups. Groups like The King's Singers (Classical/Choral 5 part male perfection), The Real Group (Internationally renowned Swedish Vocal Jazz group), and Bobby McFerrin (Vocal/Improviser and a cappella GOD!) are very different artists, but all share the same ""a cappella"" label. Look at groups in the collegiate world of a cappella. There are some seriously talented collegiate groups across the world. Although, new and great groups come about all the time!  Speaking of new, great groups! That group, could be yours! I would say you're best bet is to start a group with people who really ""jive"" well together. Pentatonix has a perfect mix of incredible talent, plus a good healthy relationship as a group. So talent is also something to look for, but a positive and forward thinking personality is a huge plus! Just be sure to be yourselves and allow the group to use each other and the very malleable art form of a cappella to do what you guys or girls do best! That's the stuff people want to see!  More in-depth of starting a group? Arrangments? Start arranging. I repeat. Start. Arranging. Period. Or reach out to other groups in your area! A cappella people like to help other a cappella people! Although, at some point your group will need it's own arrangements. So, may as well start practicing for that. So...start arranging.  Most importantly, have fun! The world of a cappella is endless. So never stop! Welcome!"
acappella,3a8l9t,Mcappella,2,Thu Jun 18 07:49:19 2015 UTC,"If you have never sung harmony before, I would suggest finding a singing partner and working on duets together.  Once you are comfortable holding onto a harmony lines, you only need 2 other vocalists to really get things off the ground.  You can find a ton of phenomenal acapella trio charts:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij1w0ItztkE"
acappella,3a8l9t,DrKoala,2,Thu Jun 18 02:32:12 2015 UTC,I have no problem in singing harmony with myself. (Pre-recorded voice then I sing over it).  Thanks for your response!
acappella,3a8l9t,previsualconsent,2,Thu Jun 18 02:33:34 2015 UTC,One great form of acapella that is really well organized is Barbershop. If you check out http://www.barbershop.org/ you can find choruses that are near you and most quartets spawn out of a chorus. It's a very rewarding style to sing. Try listening to Ringmasters and Vocal Spectrum to get an idea of how awesome it can be.
acappella,3a8l9t,sylinmino,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:20:06 2015 UTC,"Something I'd recommend is, if you want to start small, find three other guys (or girls, there are mixed versions) and start up a barbershop quartet! With a quartet you learn how to be especially precise with pitch, and how to match tone and resonance with others in harmony to create perfect ""lock and ring"" (you'll start hearing notes you four aren't even singing). Really freaking good arrangements are easy to come by, with stellar arrangements published by the barbershop harmony society at www.harmonymarketplace.com. They have unpublished ones too, but the arranger's fee is anywhere from $50-100 per arrangemement. Published ones are just around $3.50 each, and no less stellar either.  Find a local barbershop chorus too. Pretty much, the songs they may sing are awesome, but what's even cooler is you can get into random quartets at any time with other members and start singing random songs you guys know (and trust me, once you're in a chorus you'll start knowing TONS of songs. I'm only a semester through my experience with barbershop and I know at least like 20 songs memorized, some on multiple voice parts. By October, that number will be up to about 30).  Since you'll probably be in college soon too, quarteting can be maintained there, but you can also join a college a cappella group, or even form your own with friends (as others have mentioned, just start small with jamming stuff out and doing duets/trios). College a cappella has been one of the defining features of my college experience.  Oh, and since you said you enjoyed Pitch Perfect, trust me when I say this: Pitch Perfect may be great, but it is not even close to the best stuff out there. Check this out, for example: Pitch Slapped - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w4XRiUVfY4  Or this: BYU Vocal Point - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVA3iYJ_H5Y  Also, in the realm of barbershop, here are three really awesome ones (two of quartets, one of a chorus): Crossroads: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7mGjSZpdpk  Vocal Spectrum: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAeMOHlaVl4  Ambassadors of Harmony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmDGntpZC3I  Here's a tip: don't stop listening to a cappella. One form or another."

acappella,37zzoq,rewindme123,5,Sun May 31 20:55:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a music major and have directed the a cappella group at my university for several years. In that time, I've taught myself to beatbox pretty reasonably well. Here's a few suggestions about beaboxing. I'd be happy to share more about successfully auditioning and all if you want.   The first step is to be able to make the fundamental sounds of vocal percussion consistently every time. Practice them all with a metronome and make all your kick drums sound consistent, all the high hats, and all your basic snare sounds consistent. You can dig deeper into your bag of tricks and explore different timbres in there later on, but these fundamentals are essential.  Vocal percussionists are pretty much drum set players, right? That means you have to keep time really well, and you have to groove.  Again, practice with a metronome. Don't re-invent the wheel. Listen to drummers and vocal percussionists alike, listen to what they do, where they put various sounds in relation to the pulse, and how you can imitate that.  Do it all the time. I beatbox just about everywhere I can get away with it, either along with music playing, or I improvise it. My friends definitely get a kick out of it. I pretty much don't stop beatboxing. Practice with a metronome. Once I finally learned this, practicing became much more effective, both in beatboxing and my other playing and singing. It's so so so important.   If you have any more questions or need help as you're learning, don't hesitate to ask. I'd love to help :-)"
acappella,37zzoq,drh1589,5,Sun May 31 21:57:11 2015 UTC,"I've been doing Vocal Percussion for quite a few years - I'm actually in the exact same boat as you: Not an amazing singer, but my VP is good enough to get me places. So hopefully I'll be able to contribute something useful!   Beatbox or VP  First, you should know that there's a fundamental difference between vocal percussion and beatbox. In the most fundamental terms, beatbox is the art of making sounds with your mouth, mostly focused on solo performance. Here is a good example of a beatbox performance - note how the sounds he's making are more electronic sounding, and he's performing on his own.  Conversely, Vocal Percussion is the art of imitating a drummer with your vocal apparatus. It's almost exclusively used to support a performance, rather than being a performance on its own. Here's a vocal drum solo - note how most of the sounds are more imitative of a drum set (he does use a bit of lip bass in the second half though), and the performance is more focused on rhythms than on sound.   I believe that vocal percussionists are vastly more valuable to a cappella groups than beatboxers (I won't go into my reasons here, but I'm happy to follow up on it if you wanna know). So while it's useful to have a few beatbox sounds (dubstep breakdowns aren't gonna go away any time soon I'm afraid), Vocal Percussion is the one to focus on.   The Basics  So let's assume you want to focus on your Vocal Percussion. There are three basic sounds at the beginning of everything  - you probably are familiar with this so I'll only go over them briefly for completeness' sake:   Kickdrum: This grounds your beat. It packs quite a punch, so use it responsibly. The easiest way to produce a kick is by forming a very explosive, voiceless ""Dm"" or ""B"" - in some situations you might want to voice it in the low range though.  Snare: It's often described as the heart of the beat. There are two common snares - inward and outward. You do an outward snare by forming a very explosive, voiceless ""pf"". You do an inward snare by sucking air in through the sides of your mouth explosively, forming a ""ksh""-like sound. Most people prefer either inward or outward snare, but you should be able to do both.  Hi-Hat: It fills out the beat, glues it together and lends volume to it. In many respects the easiest sound, but not one that should neglected. You do a hi-hat by forming a voiceless ""ts"" sound.    There are loads of tutorials online, and pretty much every one of them will cover these basics. You probably know them already though, as well as the basic beat ('boots and cats'), so I'll move on.  What's next?  Once you know the basic sounds, you're more or less set. Everything else is just applying them. So here are my thoughts on what to do in order to become the best vocal percussionist that you can be.    Get your sense of tempo up to scratch! A song that changes tempo wildly sounds just as bad as one that shifts pitch all over the place - as vocal percussionist, you are the rhythmical backbone of the group. If the group is any good, they'll follow you no matter what you do. That's a lot of responsibility, so being able to recall the tempo of a song at any time, speed it up and then slow it down again to the same tempo, and hold the precise tempo even in a very stressful situation is absolutely vital. I've seen groups double their bpm during a piece due to excitement... not a pretty sight. It's your job to avoid that. Learn to groove! A pop song is recognisable through its groove - the combination of bassline and percussion. Hence you'll be working pretty closely with the bass section (not without reason are bass and percussion often summarised as the rhythm section in instrumental ensembles). Your group will probably do mostly covers. Yes, you'll be able to more or less get away with a standard rock beat (boots and cats) for most songs - but you shouldn't really have to resort to this too often. Listen to songs on the radio (cheesy pop and classic rock work especially well for training) and drum along. Make a note how the patterns they use influence the feel of the sound. Learn how and when to use breaks (diversions from the pattern, mostly at the end of an 8 bar figure), and how to build an arc and give direction to the song with your percussion. Be consistent! One aspect of this was already covered in 1. - the tempo needs to be steady. But there's more to this. If you've tried to drum along with a song as discussed in 2., you probably quickly discovered that your way of drumming left you with either a deficit or an excess of air in your lungs. Breathing while drumming is hard, and one of the most important parts of figuring out your part for a song is making sure you stay at a roughly constant net amount of air in your lungs - otherwise you'll change tempo, mess up your sounds, drop out completely for some time or even (worst case) pass out at the end of a song. Not fun for anyone involved. This is one of the hardest things to get right as a beginner, but don't slack here - it'll get easier eventually. If in doubt, always go for the simpler beat if it helps you stay consistent.  Diversify your sounds - part 1! This helps massively with maintaining consistency, but it's got a lot of other uses as well. If you watched Nick Girard's VP solo that I linked above, you were probably awestruck by his hi-hat figures. Having met the guy, I have to tell you that part of this is that he's just the next step in human evolution - nothing we can do about that. But his other secret is knowing a million different ways to do every single sound. Inward and outward snares are the most obvious example - yes, they sound different, but in a pinch you can substitute them for each other and it'll keep the beat roughly the same. If you have an air deficit, just do inward snares for a few bars and you'll have air again. Conversely, outward snares can help you get rid of air. Hi-hats can also be used for breathing in or out - breathing in, a ""ks"" sound will be similar to a ""ts"" breathing out and so on. Nick is incredibly nimble with his mouth, but he's also trained for ages to make each way of producing his sounds sound almost indistinguishable. Every sound he can do breathing in, breathing out, they work very well with special versions of different sounds so he can combine them very efficiently - you see where I'm going. Being able to substitute sounds that sound the same for each other helps staying on top of a complex beat without passing out. But there's more... Diversify your sounds - part 2! If you have passing familiarity with drumkits, you might know there are different kinds - you can get a rock kit or a jazz kit, and they'll sound wildly different. If you use a rock kit in a jazz song, chances are it'll sound off. The same applies to vocal percussion - the more 'styles' of sounds you have in your repertoire, the better. This is gonna require some experimentation to figure out - for example, I imitate jazz-style brushes on a snare by using plenty of 'f'-based sounds, sneaking in a bit of a lisp on the 's' whenever it comes around. Vocal percussionists are at a bit of an advantage here actually - if your group does a rock song but wants to sneak in a swing verse, you can switch kits on a whim and contribute much to the change in feel. Extend your dynamic range! Having different sounds is nice, but that's only one dimension of intelligent percussion. Singers can make a song come alive by controlling the volume of their voices - you can do the same. If a slow ballad is being performed, your percussion should be the softest of brush touches - not smashing around on the rock kit. This isn't that hard to do, it just requires a bit of awareness - but it's really, really grating when a percussionist gets it wrong. Mics help a lot with this - which gets us to the next point... Get some on-mic practice! I was drumming purely acoustically for a long time, until one time I was handed a mic at a gig. It was a pretty stressful experience - forget about looking awkward on stage because you're not used to that thing in your face, or wincing every time a sound I made came booming from the boxes. Everything was sounding all wrong - my kicks sounded like snares, my snares sounded awful and the sounds of my breath ruined the whole groove. VP on mic is very different from off mic. Again, there's not really any quick way - get in some practice so you get used to it. The mic will pick up a lot - this means your beats can be more subtle and intricate (and of a wider dynamic range, see 6.!), but you'll have to watch your breathing and you'll likely need less air. Off mic, you'll have to be louder to be heard, so you have to put more power behind your sounds - this often requires a more simple beat. Don't be surprised if your jaw starts to hurt after a few minutes of acoustic VP, either.  It can be tricky to get some hands-on time with a mic, so I wouldn't worry too much about it for now if you can't. After the experience I described above, I bought a cheap handheld mic and a cheap mixer, plugged in my headphones and practiced for a summer - a different world! Practice makes perfect, but it's just a cherry on top - don't worry about this too much in the beginning.    (continued below)"
acappella,37zzoq,drehz,3,Sun May 31 22:38:28 2015 UTC,"Lastly -  Don't give up on singing! I've listed the points roughly in the order of importance as I see it, so it's not surprising this is the last point... Singing technically doesn't have anything to do with VP. But you're auditioning for an a cappella group - their Musical Director might have a different view on this, but I firmly believe having a dedicated VP is a very stupid idea. Some songs don't require percussion, and you should be able to hold down a part in these without sticking out like a sore thumb. There are many advantages to being able to sing - I won't go into detail because this post is already massive. Suffice to say, if I was auditioning percussionists it would take a large difference in skill for me to pick a tone deaf candidate over one with a decent voice.   Closing thoughts  You've made it this far? Wow - congrats! It might seem like I've been rather exhaustive above, but really I've simplified a lot, left out more and really barely scratched the surface. The key to VP is to just try, and keep trying, and never stop - you can practice anywhere, at any time! If you're not catching odd looks from passers-by because of the constant stream of odd sounds emanating from your mouth 24/7, you're doing something wrong. That being said, don't think you have to sound exactly like anyone else - everyone has their own lungs, lips, larynx, so everyone will shape the sounds in a way that's unique to them. You'll find your own way of drumming - be confident in it, and keep at it. Practice makes perfect.   If you have any more questions, feel free to ask here or PM me - I'd be happy to help in any way I can!   Good luck!"

ACDA will know.  I've sung in competitions where each group will get specific comments, and others where the adjudicator gave general comments from the stage, but a more detailed crit comes back with the marks and sheet music, so both scenarios happen, but I prefer the former, even if it takes ages at the adjudication, because he make have ten or fifteen groups to get through. But it's all good, as the adjudicators are always well qualified people, in Ireland at least, and their comments are always welcome, even if we do poorly. It cost me €25 to enter the last competition we did.  And then pick repertoire, practice your asses off, and get up on stage and sing. That's it, really."

I like to split the competition field into 3 tiers:  The big competition is the ICCA (or ICCAs, if you want to refer to them as the multiple stages of the competition). The ICCAs are judged on both vocal and visual performance. Groups have 12 minutes to perform their set, and going over time penalizes you by one place. You can find the judging score sheets here, a description of the categories here, and a full description of the competition rules here. Judges are normally music educators, people with a good deal of experience in a cappella, people currently working in a cappella (coaches, recording engineers, arrangers), or a combination of all of that and more. The cost to enter is $250, which will be refunded if your group isn't selected to move on to the quarterfinals. If you are selected to move on to the quarterfinals, they're normally nearby. The ICCA is done by region, so quarterfinals happen at 4-5 locations within a region, some of which will be relatively close by. If you move through to the semi-finals, that's also held within the region. Nationals are in NYC. Timing-wise the various stages are held throughout spring semester. Quarterfinals are usually Feb, Semis in March, and the Finals in mid-late April.  The thing about the ICCAs is that it's a really tough competition to win, especially if you're a younger group with no real competition experience. The groups that do go through to the finals usually have incredible voices and incredible choreography, and they work on pretty much nothing else for that entire year. So if that's your eventual goal, I'd first recommend getting some competition experience in other places. A step below the ICCAs you've got festival competitions. Pretty much every a cappella festival/conference (SoJam, LAAF, BOSS, SingStrong, and a few others) hosts collegiate and professional competitions on one of the nights of the event. The application process for them is usually similar - submit a video, pay an entrance fee (they vary) if you're selected, and be judged on similar criteria as the ICCA. Even if you don't get selected for those competitions, I'd still recommend checking a festival out. It's nothing but masterclasses, workshops, and concerts, all focused on helping you better your group and your understanding of a cappella.  The next step down from the festival circuit you'll find regional competitions. These will normally be your best bet to get some good competition experience without a whole lot of pressure. These competitions are generally hosted by various college groups at other schools, local venues, high schools, etc. Usually entry fees are fairly cheap, there's a monetary prize for winning groups, and you get to have a good time with the other groups in the competition once everything's over and done with. Because these competitions are smaller, a lot of the time you'll have to seek them out the hard way, either by searching for competitions in your area or looking up groups at nearby schools to see if anything is going on. If you're lucky, you'll find some of these competitions close by. If you're not lucky, you'll have to plan a weekend trip and drive a few hours to get to one, but who doesn't love a group road trip? Some of these competitions are invitationals, some of them are just a sign up and you're in type of thing.   For ICCAs and Festival competitions, you can see the style of performance that normally wins by searching for videos online - there are a lot of them (just search by year, i.e. ICCA 2015, or search by groups that you know were in the competition). Most competitions also post the results on line, so you can check out the winning groups and see what they did.   Let me know if you have any questions!"

acappella,37qg72,CabriAster,2,Sat Jun 13 19:11:19 2015 UTC,I need to start finding a way to get myself to do a few more darker ones to give a good representation of some of the emotions I do have...  I think that's healthy right?  We all aren't just happy ALL the time... but it's almost not acceptable to show some of the darker moments.    I think it would be much more healthy for our society to discuss more openly depression... especially since so many of us fight it!
acappella,37qg72,peterhollens,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:13:45 2015 UTC,"That would be an amazing thing. Too many times the people who seem the happiest are really just covering for inner darkness that they are fighting.   The problem is not that people are unaware of depression, instead it is a problem of the stigma that comes with the word or concept of depression. The Arts have, for centuries, been a way to express those emotions. Music, especially combined with video, doubly so. Our main forms of communication are visual and auditory. When those two come together we gain a much deeper perspective into another's soul. This eliminates some of the confusion and allows another to feel along with us.    I believe that the songs are out there, but finding the emotional energy to tackle those songs must be trying. We as listeners need to remind ourselves that while we listen to a song once or twice (or a few dozen times), you listen to it many more times, to establish that you wish to produce it, to learn each part then to sing them all (understanding that multiple takes might be necessary), to mix them appropriately, then to record the video which likely will take multiple takes of much of the song.   We might listen and join in the emotions of a song you make a hundred times; you have listened and felt those emotions thousands.   Thank you for allowing us that privilege."

acappella,37daoi,iamduh,3,Tue May 26 20:04:13 2015 UTC,"A couple of points about this:   This may just be my headphones, but I'm not hearing very much bass in this recording, either in the percussion or in the vocals. There isn't much dynamic variation in the song at all, which makes it feel sort of flat. Work on seeing where you can build to make it more interesting! One thing that is missing from the original song, since you're pretty much just covering the original, is the harmonies on the lead vocals. Adding those would add a lot as far as making the arrangement more interesting! The lead vocalist is pretty good! There are a couple of parts where things are a little shaky, but it was a good performance and fun to listen to."
acappella,37daoi,peoplesayimtheman,1 point,Tue May 26 21:22:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Glad you enjoyed it.  As far as bass... I need to mix it on real speakers also, because my headphones (ATH-M50x) are pretty bassy, and I didn't want them to kill me yet. But our mic is also horrible.  We're a six-piece group, so I had to sacrifice something... Maybe we'll over-dub it.  I may have gotten a little trigger happy with the compressor..."
acappella,37daoi,bigfootgame,1 point,Tue May 26 22:02:08 2015 UTC,"Not bad!  See if you can get more even balance in the sections, we need more bass and vocal percussion.  The soloist is good, but need to commit more to the role! Similar to a musical theater piece, this song tells a story and comes across best if the lead commits to the part."
acappella,37daoi,penguininaband,1 point,Wed May 27 00:07:07 2015 UTC,I think it's a really well done cover.  Needs better production. I think recording part by part would make this even better.

Stylistically it really didn't match jazz and as a choir reading out of books and not moving is also very not jazz.   I mean sounded good but perhaps false advertising.
acappella,36nn0m,Klinger_,1 point,Sat May 23 10:59:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for saying so :) I definitely hear it as ""jazzy"", but I'm guessing that's subjective :P  If I had to quantify it: I use a tritone sub in the beginning at 0:22 which is, to me, sooooooo jazzy sounding, a lot of thicker jazz-esque voicings like at 1:11, 1:49, or 2:29, and then the middle section (with the background ooh's and doo's) is very jazz-cluster-ey. Also, the ending chord is, to me anyway, almost cheesily jazzy :P  There are definitely other things going on here though that I could understand would give more of a pop/neo-classical feel. Sorry it wasn't exactly what you expected, but thanks for watching and for your feedback :)"
acappella,36k09a,TheNewUnderground,3,Tue May 19 23:14:36 2015 UTC,Without hearing/seeing your DAW session... it's hard to say.  Questions: What DAW are you using? How were mics placed? Any chance I could grab a few mp3s of your stems to play with?  You may have to get wayyyy nitty gritty and line up the attacks to be together. I recently mixed 8 tracks (6 close mics and 2 room mics) for a 3m30 song and made about 400 splice points... to make the rhythms all sound together.
acappella,36k09a,iamduh,2,Wed May 20 00:35:54 2015 UTC,"I'm using Logic and I recorded each singer individually with an AT2020 (about 10 inches away or so?) along with a click track and a midi file. I would love to send you some stems for one of the songs that I've edited already if you really wouldn't mind! Can I PM you a dropbox link?  And I know what you're talking about with the attacks! I think I've actually got that (as well as pitch correction) sounding pretty good (if not TOO robotic), but I'm having a lot of trouble with part clarity and getting that ""in your face"" kind of sound (I know a lot of that's in mastering, but I can't even get it to sound anywhere close!)."
acappella,36k09a,iamduh,2,Wed May 20 01:57:28 2015 UTC,I'd be happy to take a look at it. Dropbox links are good. Might also need the MIDI/tempo map so Reaper will know what to do with it.

acappella,36cluk,Nolongerlurkin,2,Mon May 18 08:45:28 2015 UTC,"Well, I think it's appropriate to recognize the fact that experts and lay-people will often choose differently.  Judges/experts will presumably be better equipped than the average audience member to discern between groups that have worked their intonation to a ""good enough"" level and and groups who have made every possible decision about intonation and left nothing to chance. Same goes for vocal technique. The simple fact is that to make things as objectively correct as possible in both of these criteria is extremely difficult and takes a lot of work.  This is the kind of work that the audience may not understand or even care about after a certain point. This is why the objectively ""most correct"" performance might not be the most moving or entertaining one. This is why the crowd favorite award exists--to recognize the discrepancy and the sort of emotional communication that doesn't necessarily require technical perfection."
acappella,36cluk,iamduh,2,Mon May 18 16:34:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! I agree with everything here, good points.   This is a different discussion that leads into scoring criteria, and changes to format etc etc but I feel like entertainment and having a moving performance are part of a ""most correct"" performance. I guess that's where the truly great performers  exist eh? Moving and technically precise. Thanks."
acappella,36cluk,Alamanecer,1 point,Mon May 18 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"Well what are the judges scoring them on? Because in the competitions I go to groups are scored on music, singing and presentation. And each judge only judges in one category. I've seen groups get beaten out because another had a better presentation score and vice versa. There is definitely a balance between the two."
acappella,36cluk,lozzobear,1 point,Mon May 18 22:03:31 2015 UTC,"That sounds really interesting, is this an a cappella thing or maybe Drum Corps?  The competitions that I've sung in are Harmony Sweepstakes and ICCA. At HS its 50/50 Musicality and Performance and each judges gives a score out of 10 for each. 20 being a perfect score.   ICCA each judge scores everything as well but there are two categories (Music and visual presentation) broken down into about 20 sub categories. Scores are either 1-10 or 1-5. Intonation, rhythms, solo interpretation, and arrangement are in the music block and creativity of movement, visual cohesiveness, and things like that are in block 2. I'm not sure how each judge is expected to accurately score 20 different categories, but they somehow do it."

acappella,369hvl,LOLSauce213,3,Sun May 17 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"It's not the ICCA's. It's ICCA. :)     Have someone in your group who knows how to choreography. If you don't, appoint someone ambitious (you can do choreo yourself, but I would advise against it because it can be overwhelming to be in charge of music AND dancing) and have them get inspiration from some groups who have been successful.   Also try to find a practice space with a wall of mirrors. It helps choreo cleaning tremendously.   For the submission video, the most important thing is that you use a song that demonstrate's your group's ability, so whatever you sound best at (whether it's a power ballad or an upbeat show tune).     I didn't answer all of your questions, but I hope that helps some.    (edit: spelling/formatting)"

acappella,369hvl,iamduh,1 point,Sun May 17 21:14:46 2015 UTC,I don't see why not. My group went in with 6 this past year.
acappella,369hvl,EelHovercraft,1 point,Sun May 17 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"Since it's your first year it can be really stressful for the leadership team of your group. Remember that even performing at a quarter-final is a great networking opportunity and you should look to build connections with other groups in your region. It's tonnes of fun t0 bus/carpool to a neighboring town to open for another group's concert (and party with them afterwards).   u/LMN95 gives some great advice about delegating someone to take charge of choreography who isn't the music director. I would say the same goes for admisitration. Have one of your members volunteer to take care of all the logistics, registration, transportatation, accommodation... All of the -ations. ;P This means that the music director can focus on the music.   Speaking of focusing on the music, adapting to a new performance space is one of the most challenging aspects of an ICCA peformance. You will have a short sound-check so make sure you plan ahead so make use of it as much as possible. Be sure that mics and condensers are in a good place to pick up your group. You're a new group, so I wouldn't think you have alumni, but if friends/groupies come along with you guys it's great to have one of them standing in the hall during soundcheck so you can compare notes afterwards.   Finally, it can be a crazy day, that goes by in a blur, so bringing a friend with a good camera to take pictures and record your set is nice to have for memories, and promoting your group back on campus. And, if you're lucky enough to continue to a semi-final it's great to be able to review your set while looking at the judges notes to be able to change things up before the next round and have an even more competitive set!  Best of luck at next year's competition! Hope you do well :)"

acappella,369hvl,jessmars,1 point,Mon May 18 03:58:07 2015 UTC,"I asked a friend of mine (who understands the a cappella world better than I do), And he had some additional input:    ""Tell him to go with the flow of the group.  There's no formula for what makes a group good.  However, therein lies the challenge for new groups.  When you don't know what works best for the group, you effectively need to do trial and error a bit to find what your group likes.  From there, all it takes is an arranger to put it on paper and a choreographer to present it.  My advice:  Don't  try to be competitive.  Find your style first, and your group will figure out how to be competitive naturally."""

acappella,368oth,drowsybrowser,5,Sun May 17 06:24:15 2015 UTC,"An in-depth review from a hardcore fan:  The Good:    The Riff Off. All of it. Especially the Green Bay Packers. Most of the jokes and the random cameos. LOL. The idea of a foray into original music. More on this in a bit, but the focus on originals in a film this big kicks the door wide open for Pentatonix, who've been basically sleeping on the floor of a recording studio.  ""Any Way You Want It"" international edition! Hi Sing-Off alum! The tribute to the legacy and fraternity/sorority relationships in school acappella groups. I wish they had explored this more onscreen instead of just having them turn up in the finale and make Gail talk over the music to explain what's going on, but it was suitably moving.  Passing the Bedchel Test with flying colors.    The Things That Bugged Me:   Some of the script and direction. The first film was an instant classic. From interviews, it sounds like the first took years to write and carefully plan, but then the studio ordered a sequel and so that wasn't possible this time around. Hence random plot holes like ""The whole world hates us"" and never actually seeing the whole world hating Team USA. The resulting plot is a lot more scattershot and zany than the first. The first film's leisurely pace made its fewer laughs more memorable, this second's laughs happen so quickly and so close together that the audience stops reacting for fear of missing something. Also, this one is unlikely to birth a bunch of cultural one-liners like ""Aca-scuse me"", unless you count ""Aca-Wiedersehen, bitches"".  What happened to Chloe's low bass voice? The Germans. The whole scary-Valkyries-wearing-leather shit is tired. Aside from that, their presence has a negative effect on the soundtrack. The soundtrack to the first film is everyone's baby. How many school groups have performed ""Just A Dream/Just The Way You Are""? This film has no such moment save for the balladized ""When I'm Gone"". This time around we have thick German accents as a punchline for 90's Hip Hop (Zis is How Ve Do It) which is amusing onscreen but plays like a dumb contemporary showtune in the soundtrack. I find myself skipping those tracks, which is a shame since they're brilliantly arranged and sung.  The execution of the ""Original Music"" plotline. For us nerds in the know, whoever decided on this conflict is very smart and ahead of their time.....and also ahead of the audience's time. The idea that acappella covers are old news and passe is not true yet. There are some who will never understand or enjoy acappella for that reason, but the overwhelming majority of fans of the first film still adore cleverly arranged cover songs. They still cheer for cool arrangements. They're still impressed by beatboxing. So for me, the focus on an original here didn't add much except make the 2nd half of the finale a bit of a snooze. Secondly, they missed the point. The point of this idea is not having someone in the group who can write a song for instruments simply arrange it for voices. The point is writing songs that are intended to be acappella. In the sequel, we hear Beca and Emily's studio version of Flashlight and then we hear them do it acappella in the finale. It's literally still a cover. Sadly, the instrumental studio version is superior, and it takes all the wind out of the sails of the incredible ""Run The World"" that precedes it. I selfishly wanted an update of the first film's finale with plot-relevant songs and kickass arrangements, and instead I got sentimentality and a Jesse J ballad being passed off as an original tune. This is not to take away from all the wonderful work the acappella gods did on this music, my quibble is not with them but with the decisions made at the top.  Most of Flo's dialogue. Diarrhea and deportation jokes, all together it was just too much and veered into uncomfortable.    Something weird is in the air with the film critics' reviews. There are those who will never ""get it"" and that's fine. But it's never been more clear that some reviewers just write off any film directed by a woman, because feminism is just a trend and real movies are made by men, like they should be, like they always have been, forever and ever amen. I'm not an internet feminist or a tumblrina or any of that. It's just a little shocking to hear these writers dismiss anything targeted at females as ""girl power....yawn"" and refuse to take this film seriously. On the other hand, there are some critics actively fighting back by giving Pitch Perfect 2 a glowing review and praising its female-centric vision. Maybe I've just been naive all this time. Do I sense a culture war of sorts? We've decided that nerds are cool, are girls the new underdogs? Maybe that should be the major takeaway from both Pitch Perfect films."
acappella,368oth,webaddictress,3,Sun May 17 07:44:16 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that they're trying to do original songs, but trying to make ""Flashlight"" the new Cups makes me shudder. I felt like the song was soulless and strayed too far into the repetitive sound that is so common in pop music these days. I had a lot of trouble believing that judges at a competition would reward a group that had an original song when they had nothing to compare it to (cover-wise. The song itself hadn't been released yet when the group performed it).   I didn't feel like this one focused much on Becca. I missed her and while some of the other girls are fine, hanging the whole plot on Fat Amy was a little weird. The romantic subplot felt really forced.  Essentially, I really loved the first Pitch Perfect. But this one seemed a little flaccid, both in terms of story/plot, and music selection."
acappella,368oth,just_robot_things,4,Sun May 17 13:49:01 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the new movie, probably even more than the original. The original was decent, but I left wanting more from it. The music was good, but there didn't seem to be a lot of it for a movie about a cappella. The jokes were good, but seemed a bit generic for a comedy. I appreciated the film for exposing the world to the genre, but I didn't understand the hype.  Sequels are tough in the movie business, but I think this one holds up well. Again I enjoyed the music, but there seemed to be more/longer scenes with singing than the last one. The dialogue seemed to be inspired by a more diverse set of comedic styles, so if one type of joke didn't land, the next one would. I found myself laughing harder and more often in the new movie. It's hardly perfect, and I wouldn't say it's on my list of favorite films, but I think it's an improvement and I look forward to rewatching it when it is released on DVD."
acappella,368oth,mm502987,1 point,Sun May 17 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"Overall, I was disappointed. I wasn't an instant fan of the first either, but I grew on it. I don't think that'll happen with this one. My biggest complaint was probably the addition of Flo. You already had one ""weird one-liner"" character in Lilly, and to have those two compete for the same comedic purpose doesn't mesh well. Lots of bad stereotyping in general throughout the film, and by that I don't mean that there isn't some humor in stereotypes, I mean it was just badly executed and overused. The ""bad guys"" are German? Okay, that's fine, but you don't have to force every comedic German stereotype down our throats to portray them. Fat Amy is fat? Yeah, we understand that pretty quickly in the first film--the fat jokes are old now. Another complaint I had in the first one that I share with the sequel is that neither movie really shows the girls putting together their winning set; it just appears out of nowhere in the last second. They also made a big deal about how the use of additional theatrics was detrimental to the Bellas in their first performances, but never made an issue of it again. And okay, they won World's apparently. I guess that's a big step up from the first movie, but now that Pitch Perfect 3 in confirmed, and everyone but Emily graduated, how can you raise the stakes for another sequel? I'm interested to see how, or if, they do, but I have a feeling it's not going to work out. Last major complaint is that I didn't like the whole recording studio side story. It was unnecessary and added little tension to the plot. A few things I did like: Green Bay Packers as an a cappella group? Hilarious. That's the kind of offbeat humor I was hoping for more of. Can't go wrong with David Cross, either. I wish there was more of him in the film, too. I really liked Bumper and Fat Amy's relationship, as well as showing off Bumper as kind of the loser kid after being the asshole kid in the first movie. The use of Pentatonix was great, too. As much as I would've loved to have seen more of them in the film, the quick cameo was probably the best way to go about it."

Currently working on ""Blank Space,"" ""Uptown Funk,"" ""Carry On,"" ""Skyfall,"" and ""93 Million Miles.""  I've been performing them with groups, but want to have them properly recorded. I'm open to suggestions and others' arrangements too!"

acappella,35d1ar,honeywhiskeytrio,2,Sat May 9 03:19:50 2015 UTC,"I think there is an interesting and fertile middle ground between traditional ""pure"" a cappella (totally lacking effects, even if everyone is mic'ed) and the some of the cutting edge of electronic a cappella we're seeing in some circles (Arora, a.squared and some of what MO5AIC is doing). There's a certain degree to which it can enhance live performance without threatening the all-vocal feel.   For example, I'm usually pretty skeptical of bass pedals in live performance– I think it's often unnecessary and creates a pointless barrier between the performer and the audience; it reduces the intimacy of the experience. (Also, there are enough basses out there who can get those super low notes without the pedal anyway; if you don't have one such bass in your group, then I think you're better off playing into your group's strengths. We're all better off with a diversity of sound anyway.)  However, the Nor'easters and The Vocal Company recently put out this video of a live performance that used an octave pedal and a couple other subtle effects on the bass, and I actually think it really works. It definitely helps that they have such a large group with a complex sound to ensure that there's a full soundscape above the bass, but it's this kind of middle-ground use of effects that I think we should lean into.  More broadly, I agree with the sentiment that we need more original music. But I also think we want to avoid following the singer-songwriter model too closely– The House Jacks do this, and it's great for them, because they have no interest in going mainstream, as far as I can tell, but I think it's ultimately limiting.  Something I don't think most of us realized: Pentatonix hired professional songwriters for two of their originals on PTX, Vol. III. You can check out their names; a couple of them are actually pretty big deals. Now, I think a lot of us definitely tend toward indie and singer-songwriter inclinations, so there'd probably be some opposition to adopting this practice more widely. But I think that's something we need to wrestle with; a lot of us are pretty serious musicians and music-types, and that might create some tensions with the simplifying process that is necessary for mainstream success.   I'm not saying we can't have it both ways– have interesting indie a cappella groups and have less interesting but more recognized pop a cappella groups. But I think we need to make our peace with certain realities.  Also, I think we should not hesitate to do as Pentatonix and Peter Hollens have done, and occasionally use instruments (particularly solo instruments) in our performances. Yes, the purity of voice-only a cappella is often useful for reaching people. But sometimes there are moments when we can go even further with an instrument or two; we shouldn't let ourselves get too constrained.  Finally, I think this trend toward professionalizing collegiate a cappella (and even high school a cappella– don't get me started) is not tenable. We need to maintain the principle that anyone can get into a cappella, and that you don't need to go to a school with lots of money that can afford mics and sound systems. College is the best time to get people excited about a cappella and we need to make sure we don't accidentally create barriers for entry. Also, collegiate a cappella should be fun and I sometimes worry we're losing that at the expense of melting people's faces off.  The answer, I think, is to emphasize graduating the current crop of collegiate a cappella singers into high-powered semi-pro young adult groups. And that's definitely gonna happen– the folks in collegiate a cappella now are doing more than has ever been done before, and it's not like they're gonna stop when they leave school. This'll mean there's less pressure to do amazing stuff in college, since you'll still have the chance after college if you really want to; less pressure in college means more time for fun, which is a better fit for the age, anyway."

acappella,35d1ar,that-bot,1 point,Sat May 9 04:12:05 2015 UTC,"I definitely believe that in order for a cappella to stay mainstream, it needs to become more original. Most a cappella groups do covers, and while most people enjoy hearing songs they know done in a cool way, it will for sure get old. A cappella groups need to get an identity for themselves (Pentatonix is super good at that) and do original work. If a traditional band only did covers, they wouldn't go anywhere. A cappella only gets a pass because it's a unique style, but I don't believe that is very sustainable."
acappella,35d1ar,JimothyBros,3,Sat May 9 03:25:27 2015 UTC,"If a traditional band only did covers, they wouldn't go anywhere.    Except for, you know, every jazz or big band performance ever."
acappella,35d1ar,JewBot6000,3,Sat May 9 14:49:46 2015 UTC,"Things differ from genre to genre. In jazz, it's much more about the musician's interpretations of the Standards.   You do bring up a point, but perhaps his comment was directed towards mainstream music, and not to be taken as a blanket statement to cover all genres. Cuz, that'd leave out a lot of symphony orchestras as well."
acappella,35d1ar,JewBot6000,2,Sat May 9 15:24:37 2015 UTC,"That's kind of my point. A huge majority of a capella music I've been exposed to in my life has been vocal jazz, where the importance is put on the arrangement and interpretation of older tunes."

acappella,3396d1,Nolongerlurkin,2,Mon Apr 20 17:32:40 2015 UTC,"They killed it man! Great job on the arrangements. Even though the VoCals placed first, this set certainly is a great representation of top notch college a cappella.   Man, also how do you get such huge walls of sounds in your arrangements?!?! That's what I always notice, the quiet parts are voiced in a way to make them extremely interesting and engaging, then when the contrast in the forte section comes it's like an explosion. I know some of that is the excution of the singers, but when I'm arranging sometimes I go for simiar effects and it doesn't seem to have the same impact but I cant figure it out. Best example is 6:55-8:00 in this video."
acappella,3396d1,kcirbaj,2,Tue Apr 21 08:12:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Really the biggest factors toward making a wall of sound are (1) having singers that can belt powerfully without yelling, and (2) knowing every single singer's money range and arranging around them. So for example, the big climactic chord at 7:21 was written for a couple power sopranos having great belted Bbs, but not much higher (even 7 minutes into an ICCA set).  However, you can't make the wall without a proper foundation under the wailers (which could get into some theory, but really it's just about feeling the balance). Then it's just a matter of setting up the moment right (both contextually and lyrically). ""Now here we are"" hits especially hard because the emotion of the words call for peeling the paint off the walls with sound, and end of the previous phrase (""we'd be as one"") aims to create contrast by losing all thicker harmonies by being just in octaves (""as one"") and tapering substantially on ""one"" to reach a pianissimo right before. Since the last chorus needs to be nearly as strong, this particular moment only gets a quick catch breath before moving on, but keep in mind that that isn't always the right thing to do. Thinking ""horizontally"" is just as important as the ""vertical"" details of the exact voicings.  tl;dr If you're short on great belters, write around the money range of the handful of people in the group who can do it well, setup your moments beforehand, and let them land with whatever space/momentum they need to have their impact and carry the arrangement forward."

I've been arranging for a my old group as an alum for about a year now. It's going pretty well, but I worry that eventually my arrangements will not be as compatible for newer generations"
acappella,3396d1,Nolongerlurkin,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:46:19 2015 UTC,"My situation is a little bit different since I'm still a student at UChicago. I stopped performing with the group 2 years ago because the schedule demands of being a 3rd/4th year med student just wouldn't allow me to do it. However, I'm still fairly involved with the group and became familiar with their newbies pretty much right from the start (I was at their callbacks with another ex-MD, which gave me a pretty good idea of the singers ranges/strengths/special skills/etc). I was also at nearly every rehearsal during ICCA season to teach those arrangements and help finesse the set.  If I didn't have that level of familiarity, you're right it would be much much harder. If you are going to continue to arrange for your old group, I think you're gonna need to figure out ways to learn what the newer members are capable of as individuals, who the great soloists are, and how they're sounding as a group to make your arrangements as effective as possible. If you don't have geographic proximity to go to some rehearsals, maybe some recordings/skype sessions or something. I'm sure the current musical leadership can also help you figure it out too since they (should) obviously know that as well."
acappella,3396d1,Atomicbob11,5,Mon Apr 27 22:23:07 2015 UTC,"Not to take away from the tremendously talented and dedicated groups that consistently perform well over many years, but I have to admit I'm getting a little tired of seeing the same five group names atop the standings and how predictable the results often are."
acappella,3396d1,Atomicbob11,3,Mon Apr 20 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"Nor'Easters didn't appear in the top three though...that was somewhat surprising.   Also, I think this is slowly changing but at most schools, the best singers aren't singing a cappella. You can have really well done arrangements, inventive choreo, and tons of hours of work but if you don't have solid voices you won't win the finals. I don't know how it is at other schools but I know at my university if you put together the best 16 singers from the music department, and gave them this music with adequate rehearsal time, they could sound like VIYH or the VoCals for sure. It's demonstrated in the traditional Chamber Choirs and Jazz Choirs all the time, but when auditions come around we mostly have singers who did high school choir, and a small handful of music students. Nothing wrong with that, and I'm extremely proud of what groups from our school have accomplished, but it's hard to out work and prepare against groups who work just as hard and are just as creative as you...but they also have an entire group of great singers."
acappella,3396d1,jessmars,3,Tue Apr 21 08:08:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely this. Voices in Your Head has no music majors, and in all honesty, the majority of them are not particularly great all-around singers (in contrast to many of the groups from major performing arts schools). However, during our auditions process, we focus very much on identifying good musicians (even if not amazing vocalists), and work very hard to figure out how to use everybody's abilities to the fullest extent that we can and help them develop their skills further. In the context of ICCAs, this also means being very very picky about song selection to best fit the style and strengths of our best soloists and arranging carefully to show off the group sound without being too demanding for everyone's abilities.  Some groups may have the bench depth to sing pretty much any 3 songs and advance, but this is certainly not the case for us. Every ICCA season, we pick 3 entirely new songs to make a set from scratch during the fall after we know exactly who is in the group and what our soloist options are. We have only once (in 2009) pulled one song from our pre-ICCA repertoire (which didn't work out so well haha)."
acappella,3396d1,kcirbaj,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:26:39 2015 UTC,"With respect to auditioning, is there a certain ""test"" or something that you look for that is especially good at trying to identify good musicians? Possibly callbacks of some sort? - just trying to see if there is something that my group may be able to adjust with the audition process"
acappella,3396d1,Nolongerlurkin,4,Mon Apr 27 04:06:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so there are some specific tests that we do, but really every aspect of the audition can be very revealing if you pay attention to the right things. I can't stress enough that taking the right people is everything to your group's success, and many groups I think miss some great musicians over pretty voices (this is so important that some years, we've only taken 1-2 people when we really could've used quite a few more because the auditionee pool's core musicianship just wasn't up to snuff). Also to be super clear, by musicianship/musicality, I don't mean training (I particularly don't mean vocal training). Training can be great to give context and teach people labels and strategies for things, but really what we're looking for is musical instincts.  However, there are a few overarching things that pervade every aspect of the audition.   Tuning. If an auditionee has tuning problems, it doesn't matter how amazing their solo voice/personality/presence is. It's an absolute deal-breaker because more than almost any other skill, it seems to be extremely difficult to teach (and all it takes is one person to totally screw up the group sound, which is such a key element of sounding good). This has led to some major fights during deliberations (particularly with younger, less experienced members), but we have passed on quite a few people because of even mild tuning problems that I think many groups would snatch up in a heartbeat. Musical awareness. I don't know if I've ever seen a truly perfect audition in my 7 years doing it. When somebody makes a mistake, do they seem like they're aware, or are they obliviously charging along thinking that everything is awesome. To be clear, this is a subtle thing, I'm not saying people need to make a huge deal out of it (and in fact they shouldn't and confidence is important), but if you're watching for it, you can tell. Watch their eyes. Let the geniuses prove themselves. We ask people to do some really hard stuff later in the audition. This can make people feel bad when they don't nail it, but what we try to make clear is that we don't expect anyone to be perfect. By doing so, we can clearly identify the truly exceptional from the solid musicians (both of whom would likely nail the typical straightforward a cappella audition musical exercises). This is especially important for people who just don't have amazing solo voices, but would be fantastic block singers, since they can often slip under the radar. I can't stress enough how much this informs the process.   As to how the audition actually goes, we start with scales. This ""warms them up"" by doing 5 notes of a major scale going up and then down by half steps. We ask them to stay in their chest voice as long as possible. This tells us their range (and also tells us if they even know what their chest voice is), but often scales are so revealing that we know probably 80% of who is getting called back and who isn't within just a couple of scales (notably, before their solo). Furthermore, I do not think most auditionees are aware of the importance of their scales to the outcome of their audition. Here are some specifics:   Do they actually properly go up/down by half-steps? A mark against musicianship are people who don't have that interval well internalized and either go not far enough or too far with each shift. An almost-guaranteed nail in the coffin for someone's audition that is extremely common is getting ""stuck"" and continuing to sing the same key over and over again, particularly if it seems like they aren't aware of it (most often happens on descending scales). How are their intervals between each of the notes in the scale? I don't so much mean vocal imperfections (particularly at the edges of their ranges), but consistent problems (e.g. smearing notes rather than precisely singing all 5 notes, not quite making it up to the 5th note everytime, doing wacky psuedointervals within the scale, etc.).   We then have them sing their solo, which (ideally) shows us what they do more in their comfort zone. While the main insight here relates to what they could bring to the group as a soloist, you also learn a lot about tuning, precision, presence, and personality. Song choice also gives some interesting insight as well, and mistake awareness is also important. More subtle cues come from things like: do they actually know what key they want to sing the song in, did they actually prepare for the audition (i.e. are they indecisive about what song they're going to sing or trying to read lyrics off their phone), do they properly observe longer note/rest duration, etc.  The music director then makes a decision about whether the audition should continue or not. This does kind of suck, but we have so many auditions and so little time that we can't let everyone do everything that we might want to test. We do have a fairly subtle way of handling it though, so the people who really just wandered into the audition probably don't know the difference. However, people who do their homework often know what's up, and it makes us feel bad.  If the audition proceeds, we do sight-singing and tonal memory. We have 3 difficulties of each, with the first being pretty accessible to most people and the last being extremely difficult (maybe a couple people each year get the last one over half right). Strategies and mistakes in these exercises are hugely revealing about someone's musical smarts.  For sight singing and tonal memory, we do 3 difficulties. We let people take about a minute to look it over the sight-singing before trying, and will play each tonal memory exercise 3 times. Great signs here are people who seem to be ""hearing it"" in their heads, or even lightly humming (sometimes if somebody is lightly humming and nails it, we'll just let them go on to the next level). Similarly, you often see people doing things with their hands (playing the air piano, those weird solfege hand shapes that I don't know anything about) that hint that their brain is actually thinking about the music in a meaningful way. Once they actually start, other than the obvious correctness or knowing when they're off, there are some really meaningful subtleties here. You'll also usually pick up on any perfect pitch(ish)-ers here too.   Are their mistakes ""musical""? By that I mean, if they sing the wrong note, is it still a note on the 12 tone scale? Is it a note in the key? Do they properly observe rests/some semblance of a tempo, or is it an atempo series of notes? If they get off, can they get themselves back on track, or are they lost forever? One example of this is what happens with their key center. Our exercises always start and end on the tonic, even if they totally miss the boat in the middle, do they come to the end, realize it should be the same place that they started, and sing the original key, or just sing something nonsensical.   IMPORTANT: We also very deliberately write these exercises to be melodic and follow some semblance of a reasonable underlying harmonic structure (even the hard ones). I've seen some groups try to do harder sight-singing and tonal memory that is more or less non-nonsensical (random huge interval jumps, no sense of melody or ebb and flow). This is a big mistake because it's not at all what you'll actually be asking the singers to do in the group, and for people with a boatload of talent, but maybe not so much training, it will unnecessarily trip them up (since it just doesn't make sense to how music works in their brains). If you do it right, the people in the group listening to the auditions will still be able to sing the entirety of the tonal memory exercise even years later because it's so catchy (keep in mind they hear it 100ish times instead of 3 like the auditionees).  Some more details. The lack of sight-singing skill is not at all a deal-breaker. Some people just don't have the background and that's totally fine. However, for those that do, you can learn a lot.   Difficulty 1 is always in C major, has no accidentals, and is almost entirely whole and half-step intervals, mostly as quarter and half notes. This lets you tell apart people who have just the slightest sight reading skills from those who don't even know where to begin. It also builds confidence for your star auditionees. Difficulty 2 usually has a couple of accidentals in the key and is sometimes minor. While a lot of it still is step-wise, there are some larger intervals (usually 4ths, 5ths, octaves, and maybe 6ths). The rhythms will also be a bit trickier. We might throw a couple of accidentals or a sensible 7th in near the end. Difficulty 3 is still definitely melodic, but it has numerous large intervals that are sometimes slightly less obvious, lots of accidentals, trickier rhythms, etc.   For tonal memory, we write one fairly long pretty melody (usually 16 bars in 4/4) and break it into 3 chunks. We make it scoot around a bit harmonically. By this I mean, for all of these exercises, I actually have a chord progression that I wrote it with that explores other centers (but I do not play the chords for them, it's neat when you notice people having an intuition about the underlying harmonies, sometimes without even realizing it). We maybe spend some time centered around the IV or V in the 2nd chunk, and near the end of the 3rd chunk, do something more different but still ear catching). The first two chunks are of equal length (usually 4 bars each), and then the last is the same length as the first two combined (again, really hard haha). A great sign here are people who forget some of the middle, but then bring it back and end in the right key (and sometimes can remember the last couple of bars too).  Apparently my reply is too long to include the stuff about callbacks, so I'll make another comment. Also, sorry if it's somewhat disorganized and ramble-y, I'm on vacation in Europe and sick, so I'm not exactly myself right now haha... :-P"
acappella,3396d1,kqtie,3,Mon Apr 27 23:29:39 2015 UTC,"Ok callbacks. We tend to callback 15ish people, and usually take 5-7 people (though some years, we've only taken 1 or 2 if the pool isn't so deep). Deciding who to callback is a largely inclusive/""sensitive"" selection process (I mean sensitive in the technical sense, i.e. don't miss anyone that gives you hints of something special). After callbacks, we do a ""specific"" process (where we eliminate people who have something there, but aren't good fits overall for various reasons). During callbacks, we teach several tuning/blending exercises (usually consists of one I wrote that's fairly easy, but has a more modern a cappella harmonic flow, as well as several barbershop tags), and have different combinations of current members/callbackees in groups of 4 sing it a lot in different ranges. This is really the best test for precise tuning that I've found, and again, problems here are deal-breakers.  We also have them learn a background part on their own, but then also teach it in sectionals to see how well they can replicate nuances/dynamics/etc. how quick they pick up on things, and how they respond to feedback and interact with the other people. We also have them learn a solo from our existing repertoire, and the current and ex-MDs present at callbacks work to coach everyone individually (but in front of the other people singing that solo) before performing it with the group. These attempts to teach and coach not only give us a sense of where people are at, but some idea of how able and willing they are to make adjustments and what their near-term ceiling might be. This may sound intense, but we work really hard to keep it very light, constructive, ideally motivational, and informal. This obviously tells volumes about the potential cultural fit as well.   Another category of auditionee that we run into during callbacks are people who really do have the potential, but are just not quite ready in one way or another to be in the group that year (but on several occasions, people in this category have re-auditioned and gotten in after a year or so of being in another group).  By the end of it all, the experienced members usually have a really clear idea of who to take. However, we intentionally let deliberations last much longer than would really be necessary to make sure that everyone has a chance to voice their opinions and make a case for someone, and so younger members put their maybe-not-so-focused-on-the-right-things opinions out there and ideally learn why what they're pushing for or fighting against isn't such a great idea. Then, (hopefully) they ""get it"" by the time they're among the senior leadership in a couple of years, and can pass it on to the generation after them. ""Institutional memory"" is perhaps the single greatest challenge facing collegiate groups maintaining their level when they completely turn over every 4(ish) years, and who to take or not during auditions has been in my experience the greatest example of where a lot of (otherwise really great, talented) people's intuitions frequently aren't on point (imo). This really does usually have to be taught."

acappella,32ne54,thatguysunny,3,Wed Apr 15 04:22:01 2015 UTC,"Pick a song that fits your voice.  I've seen lots of auditions where the singer sings something that is out of their range or they try to impress with too many vocal acrobatics.  It's better to sound great on a simpler song than sound mediocre singing something more difficult. Learn/practice vocal percussion.  Having this skill makes you a much more valuable group member.  Focus on a good sound and steady tempo. Practice sight-reading.  At callbacks my group would have prospective members sight-read arrangements with us.  If you show you can learn music quickly it will help your stock. Be yourself and have fun.  Another big factor that my group considered was personality.  We spent a lot of time together in and outside rehearsal, so we needed members who we could easily work with and have fun performing with.   Good luck!"
acappella,32ne54,PhilipPReilly,4,Wed Apr 15 13:19:34 2015 UTC,"Sing something that you love to sing! An important part of the audition is to see if the person auditioning is having fun with what they're doing. However, please don't sing Cups, Let it Go, or Titanium.  Those 3 songs have been used in WAY too many auditions.   If you can, sing in front of friends/family. Sing in front of a mirror. Feedback is your best friend. Singing in front of new people will make you more confident when you have to sing in auditions.   I would also contact the group that you're looking to audition for and see how the ""typical"" audition goes, and see what their requirements are.   While you have a few months, if you don't VP already, I would try to learn some.  Even if it isn't your primary talent, I know I at least like to see potential or willingness for people to learn.

They've been neck and neck throughout the competition, so I'm glad they get a chance for a rematch in the finals. I think the Nor'easters will pull through and beat the Devils in their final rematch, though.  That being said, the SoCal VoCals and Voices in Your Head are always ones to watch out for. I've also heard that Faux Paz is a dark horse; they've never made it to a final before, but their set is apparently very strong. I'm excited to see how they do.   My top 3:    Nor'easters Vassar Devils  SoCal VoCals"
acappella,322rt2,Nolongerlurkin,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:38:54 2015 UTC,VoCals 3rd at the finals? That's a bold prediction! I am also probably biased because I'm from the West but I have them 1st.   1.VoCals  2.Voices in Your Head  3.Nor'easters

acappella,31v4bt,edward_would,3,Wed Apr 8 12:00:16 2015 UTC,"I really like this. Great work on the transcription. Sounds like it would be a nice challenge to sing. I particularly enjoyed the way you structured the song to build with the parts coming in subtly and then fade out again beautifully.  If you wanted to improve your recording sound, Audacity has a noise-removal effect, or just dial down the 10k+ frequencies in the EQ and the noise will be brought down."
acappella,31v4bt,riyten,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:44:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I actually notated this before I sang it - I find that's the most effective way for me to make a composition come together

acappella,31jz6w,fmhall,2,Mon Apr 6 04:47:31 2015 UTC,I have liked several of their songs in the past. And sounds like this should be a good album as well.
acappella,31jz6w,zatchstar,2,Mon Apr 6 00:32:11 2015 UTC,"They absolutely have great voices (I've seen them live and they're pretty good!). That being said, they must have an a cappella god mixing/mastering their albums. Like a Deke Sharon/Ed Boyer level professional mastermind - not to detract at all from their product. A group is measured just as much by their vocal quality as they are by their business decisions. Performance, production and programming are  hallmarks of modern a cappella and the Melodores excellently demonstrate all three. Although there are many groups that may display a higher level of consistent vocal talent, the Melodores exemplify the modern paradigm of performance; blending their ability to create music with their unique capacity to create genuine entertainment."
acappella,31jz6w,drunkacappellafan,3,Mon Apr 6 05:25:32 2015 UTC,"Melodore here! We actually had Shane Stever (one of our founders and a cappella YouTuber) mix the album, and Bill Hare mastered it! Thanks for all the love, and please go out and buy the album if you can! We strived to keep this album as authentic as possible, a task I believe we succeeded in."
acappella,31eua7,edward_would,2,Sat Apr 4 11:49:45 2015 UTC,Fantastic. Being able to turn a situation like this around is an indicator of true talent - I'm going to keep an eye on Semi-Toned in the future!
acappella,31eua7,RiverStrymon,5,Sat Apr 4 19:06:38 2015 UTC,"Aha I think you've misunderstood! This group is the Swingle Singers, a long-established professional international group.

acappella,31eua7,RiverStrymon,3,Sat Apr 4 19:41:39 2015 UTC,Ha! Nevermind then. Of course the Swingle Singers would do this.
acappella,31eua7,nitdus,1 point,Sat Apr 4 19:52:02 2015 UTC,That was very impressive and charming the way this was handled. Clearly very talented musicians who know how to improv. This would have been very cool to see live.
acappella,31eua7,j-boo91,1 point,Sun Apr 5 15:56:19 2015 UTC,The improvisation on this situation was pure genius.
acappella,31burr,blasianFMA,6,Fri Apr 3 17:14:49 2015 UTC,"I am able to sing with others     Demonstrate breath support by holding your long notes steady and swell to the end. Stay on time. It's a solo audition, so all you can demonstrate is good technique.    Negro Spiritual A Cappella   Belt if that's what you do. Sing one of these songs if you feel  comfortable. My group always looked for a variety of backgrounds, and most auditionees were theater kids, so anyone not singing showtunes or pop got a +1 from me.   Any recommendations?   If you don't have a song you already know like the back of your hand, go check out the new group's repertoire and learn the solo to one of those. If you want to do something they haven't, put the songs into pandora for recommendations on similar songs.  Whatever you choose, make sure it catches everyone's attention QUICKLY. Don't sing Lovesong because everything is three notes for the first 12 measures of the solo. Adele made a beautiful recording of it which inspired a lot of people, but without a beat driving it, this song is boring.  Last time I auditioned, I sang At Last because it starts with big jumps, it has lots of space to show you can keep time, it has sections to belt and sections for runs.  My favorite auditionee sang Pure Imagination  Lots of girls do well with Love on Top and lots of guys do well with Various Frank Sinatra songs  Way too many people do Sunday Morning  But most of all, don't just mimic the original... make the song your own!"
acappella,31burr,gosp,2,Fri Apr 3 17:44:23 2015 UTC,"In college I always enjoyed seeing what the common audition songs would be that year. Often they were great songs but horrible audition songs, like Valerie by Amy Winehouse or I'm Yours by Jason Mraz. I'd emphasize the point that you need to separate your enjoyment of a song from the skill that it demonstrates. Try to find a song that you enjoy that shows your range, expression, and skill."
acappella,31burr,Tataku,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:11:01 2015 UTC,thanks a lot! This will definitely help :D
acappella,31burr,nitdus,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:52:35 2015 UTC,Sing a short snippet from a song you are already comfortable with. Learning a new song for an audition causes unneeded stress.
acappella,318zmp,Nolongerlurkin,4,Thu Apr 2 23:17:34 2015 UTC,"Pro here. I've seen plenty of self-recorded stuff turn out pretty well. Many of these groups do have access to a little more gear/an actual studio though. Dhamakappella did this recently (https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/naya-zamana-welcome-to-new/id975941102). If it's something you have to do, it's very possible to make it work. If you want specific tips, I'm happy to provide them. http://ericscholzproductions.com/eric-scholz-productions/contact/  However, the gear is not really the greatest benefit of having a pro around. Many a cappella pros are arrangers/voice coaches/group directors who can help organize and tweak things to sounds more awesome in the long run. The organization aspect also allows you to save a little bit of time in editing and mixing. My recording rate is my cheapest rate just because I like being around for the beginning of the process and making sure everything is running smoothly from the get-go."
acappella,318zmp,yespy,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:23:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response! I'm going to send you an email later today when I get a bit of time.
acappella,318zmp,nattysharp,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:39:02 2015 UTC,Pros also have the added benefit of looking from the outside in. They have a hefty amount of experience and have seen what does and doesn't work. They can usually provide input for changes or tweaks during recording that members wouldn't think of because they've grown comfortable with the songs.
acappella,318zmp,speakfor3,3,Fri Apr 3 20:54:27 2015 UTC,"We just finished tracking an album ourselves! It's been a really rewarding process. Besides saving money, one of the biggest benefits is being able to take all the time you need to get the exact takes that you want. We also very much enjoyed spending all those hours hanging out and making music together - it's definitely brought the group closer together. So it's definitely possible, and it might even be something you want to do instead of something you have to do.   That being said, you need a certain mix of hardware, expertise, and passion in order to make it really work for you.    You'll need a computer running a modern DAW (laptop worked fine for us), an interface, a couple pairs of headphones, a decent mic, and a good space.  It's also important for your main producer to know how the pros approach tracking. There's some stuff that you take for granted in a professional studio but is a little tricky to execute yourself, like recording without breaths, spacing out the different takes so they cut between each other well, and knowing what can be corrected in post and what can't.  Finally, you really have to love recording. Tracking yourselves is a massive time commitment and will get pretty tiring. It's like taking on a part-time job for a couple months, especially for your main producer.    That's what our experience was like, at least. Hopefully it'll be considered a success story - we'll find out in a month or two haha.   I'm happy to answer further questions if you have any. If you decide to go with it, I'd also suggest contacting pros directly with more technical questions - Dave Sperandio and Eric Scholz have been really supportive of our project, which was a huge help."

acappella,318zmp,rishel,3,Fri Apr 3 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"I've recorded and edited all of Voices in Your Head's releases since 2008. It's definitely doable if you have the right people in your group and you can save a ton of money and be much more particular and experimental than would be possible if you were paying somebody by the hour. Though I am obviously biased, there is no doubt in my mind that Voices's in-house recording is essential to not only how the finished products turned out, but also the goals we were able to set for ourselves in the first place.  I taught a workshop on this topic at BOSS a couple of years ago, and put my class materials online here. I think you would also find the  AEA's recording guide to be very useful (it's accessible under the Resources menu once you register a free account)."

They  have a cool, folk-jazzy style. Smyr is an all-female vocal group from my hometown. They do western Norway traditional, jazz, and church-inspired music, all original works. I love them because they sing in my dialect, and with the natural quality of women's voices from where I'm from. But they're also really skilled. Amarcord is an all male German group, ""classical"", but not necessarily more so than the Comedian Harmonists which they remind me of. I really liked their version of Smedvisa, a Swedish choral classic.  The Songmen is another male classically oriented group, from UK. As usual I prefer the folk/trad songs of the classical groups, and their ""Skye Boat Song"" is wonderful. I couldn't have an a cappella playlist and leave out Bobby McFerrin and Manhattan Transfer's version of ""one night in Tunisia"", could I?"

acappella,30gbyy,MysticLordOrlouge,3,Fri Mar 27 03:15:55 2015 UTC,"Good luck trying to arrange Arabic music for a cappella.  You might be able to do it, but a cappella is generally focused on harmony and Arabic music tends to be modal and generally incompatible with harmony.  It's interesting to hear various genres of Arabic music made into pop music, though.  It becomes totally different.  Here's an example (all Jewish; this is what I listen to):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdU8slQwm4c  This is Sagiv Cohen's rendition of the Yemenite chant for L'chah Dodi.  Now here's a traditional rendition:  http://www.piyut.org.il/tradition/english/456.html?section=morePerformances&currPerformance=555&playing=0  That's a kind of extreme example, I guess -- I find Yemenite chant completely alien to me.  It all sounds like yelling.  Sagiv Cohen, who is Yemenite himself, presumably doesn't find it so alien, so he gave it a Western style.  It still sounds Yemenite, but it makes more sense to Western ears now.  (My a cappella group in grad school sang something by Sagiv Cohen, but it was one of his pop songs, not a Jewish song.)"

acappella,30gbyy,NathanDahlin,2,Fri Mar 27 17:06:50 2015 UTC,"I'm an MD of an a cappella group, and I'm also Arab. There are definitely certain aspects you can adopt from Arabic Nasheeds (like the ISIS ones). If you wanna have those influences, you would use the harmonic minor scale, with a focus on the i, iv, and V chords (so in A minor it would be Am, Dm, and E). It would be mostly homophonic background with a soloist that takes some liberty.  The poetry in Nasheeds (like Arabic poetry in general) is extremely rhythmic, and there is a lot of repetition of phrases. Often the soloist will say a phrase, and the background will repeat it, and then that would be repeated twice before a new phrase comes in.  I also often wish Arabic Nasheeds are used for things other than audio to a video of people being killed, so I encourage and appreciate your curiosity/interest."

acappella,301ayr,youlazymary,6,Mon Mar 23 18:00:31 2015 UTC,"I don't notate the vocal percussion.  The VP in my group is very good at what he does, and he listens to the original as well as to the group sing the arrangement a few times and comes up with something, and he's always adjusting.  Depending on the skill of your VP(s), you probably don't need to write it out.  If there are specific things you want them to do, you can probably just tell them yourself!"
acappella,301ayr,Keplz,4,Mon Mar 23 19:57:11 2015 UTC,"Short answer: You don't.   Slightly longer answer: Of course you could use drum notation, but very few beatboxers will be able to make sense of that... You can mostly rely on your VP to figure out what to do, and if they don't or you have some specific ideas for the percussion, communicate with them to make sure you arrive at a sound you're both happy with.    As for choosing syllables... It's the eternal question, really. I'll try to keep it relatively short here and say, experimentation is key. Listen to recordings, try to imagine what kind of effect you want and figure out what sound gives you that effect. Try different combinations of consonants and vowels. Don't be afraid to go in with your group and just try lots of things out, you can change anything on the fly if it gets you better results! (This goes for arranging in general, not just syllable choice). It's also really helpful to listen to lots of arrangements and specifically note what vowel sounds they used, and what effects they got from them. Hope that helps!"
acappella,301ayr,drehz,3,Mon Mar 23 21:15:20 2015 UTC,"My group also usually leaves it up to our beatboxer to figure it out. I'm not sure I've ever seen an actual part written out on any arrangement. Usually we just make a note on the score to the effect of ""Beatboxing starts here."" However, if you are really wanting to write something down, I would suggest basic drum notation just to give an idea of the type of beating you are looking for. Edited for spelling/typo"
acappella,301ayr,admalcol,2,Mon Mar 23 21:37:32 2015 UTC,"I notate it using drum set notation, because then it's more accurate in the playback.  Depending on who the VP is, it may or may not stay in the arrangement.  But coming from arranging for large instrumental ensembles, this is fast and easy for me.  Most arrangements I've seen don't have VP.  I tend to be picky about the rhythms though."
acappella,301ayr,m1stertim,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:47:19 2015 UTC,"Little back story: This is the first time I've finished an a cappella arrangement before, ""finished"" being very generous. Beatboxing is not something I'm familiar with whatsoever, so I don't want to insult a true beatboxer by notating something too simple. Nor do I want to trust an individual to add their beatboxing alone. I've been having trouble finding some good examples to reference. I'm having the same problem with deciding what syllables to have the background parts sing behind the soloist. I've already added a couple, but I have no idea whether or not they're effective. Help!"
acappella,301ayr,mostlymutualmastur,3,Mon Mar 23 18:09:13 2015 UTC,"Well I think, depending on the skill of your beat boxer, you might have to take a leap of faith and hope that your beat boxer will figure it out. I have been in a few different groups at different levels, and generally the arranger differs to the beat boxer to develop their own patterns by listening to the original version of the song.  If you want to lay down some kind of rhythm I would suggest using percussion/drum notation, where there is an x at the top (or bottom) of the stem."
acappella,301ayr,n3wb224,4,Mon Mar 23 18:13:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. As a beatboxer myself, I usually wait until the group runs through the song, while I play around with the original. After they have it down, I jump in and modify based off the arrangement. Hope this helps!"
acappella,301ayr,lozzobear,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:07:25 2015 UTC,Just tell 'em where the stops are and maybe any hits you want them to catch. Work with them in rehearsal or send them a recording of a groove if you like.
acappella,301ayr,jaiowners,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:34:41 2015 UTC,I'm definitely no expert but I'd suggest trying out some Luciano Berio style stuff.
acappella,301ayr,xiipaoc,1 point,Tue Mar 24 03:10:00 2015 UTC,"I just use percussion notation when I want specific stuff in the VP, and I leave it un-notated when I don't want anything particular.  For the record, percussion notation uses a regular staff with a percussion clef (two vertical lines from the second to the fourth line of the staff).  The bottom space (treble F) is usually the bass drum and the second space from the top (treble C) is usually the snare.  I'll notate other instruments wherever.  Usually, the suspended cymbal goes in the top space with an X notehead.  Toms go on the lines.  Crash... middle line, X notehead.  Or something, I don't remember.  Second space, maybe?  Whenever a new instrument is introduced, it's labeled in the music, because otherwise the VP has no chance of guessing it!  I usually put whatever syllables in there that I would use if I were doing VP, but I don't do VP so the actual person who's good at it can sing whatever syllables he or she wants.  You should really only score the VP if you have a good reason to do it -- for example, if it's a special solo part or if there's some specific rhythm you want there.  In one of my pieces, the rhythm is regular 4/4 stuff the whole time, with 16th notes every once in a while, etc.  Two measures have triplets instead.  That's when it's crucial to notate the perc.  Also, every chorus, towards the end, has a rest on beat 2 of one particular measure, and the VP should do a suspended cymbal in the gap.  That's notated.  Every chorus, that is, except for the last one, where the VP should not do a suspended cymbal in the gap, extended by another eighth rest, leaving a big ol' silence in the music for a whole beat.  Since it's notated, there's really no possibility for confusion.  On the other hand, another of my pieces is a pop song.  No need for notation; the VP can figure that shit out.  I have markings like ""VP enter"" and ""VP tacet"" and otherwise, he can do whatever."
acappella,301ayr,scubagoomba,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:44:50 2015 UTC,"I'll go ahead and echo the sentiments made by everyone else: Don't do it! However, I'm going on the assumption you're going to be in the group/rehearsing with them; is that accurate? If so, then definitely still direct the vocal percussionist so (s)he knows what to do with respect to the arrangement."
acappella,301ayr,Not_MyCabbages,0,Thu Mar 26 16:57:30 2015 UTC,"Generally it's just written as it sounds, most commonly (for example):  b or bm- bass drum  k- standard snare  pf- hard snare  ka- rim shot  t or ts- closed hi-hat  tsh- open hi-hat  d or dm- toms  ff- brushes on snare  psh- crash cymbal  There is no official beatboxing alphabet but this is what I have seen written out for the most part. Obviously this is very painstaking to write out and the your VP will probably ignore most of it anyway, so when I arrange I only write syllables in when I want something very specific from our beatboxer, but then again, I don't often use sheet music."

acappella,2zfy2y,Not_MyCabbages,3,Wed Mar 18 06:29:39 2015 UTC,"It's actually a natural response to stress to begin breathing quickly and shallowly. Even if you don't have a pronounced 'fear of performing' it's difficult not to fall out of the relaxed state that you have when rehearsing with your friends. How do you correct this? Surprise! Practice.  First of all, in rehearsal you should start exerting a mental effort to breathe more deeply, concentrating on expanding your ribs laterally with each breath. Secondly, you can actually expand your lung/ribcage capacity over time by using breath exercises that focus on stretching your ribcage further open with each breath. For instance, place you heels together and touch your toes. In that position your ribs will automatically expand backwards when you breathe deeply. Spend 30 seconds at a time focusing on stretching out your ribcage."
acappella,2zfy2y,ElDoctor,3,Wed Mar 18 14:25:57 2015 UTC,"A couple things off the top of my head that have helped me:  Posture is pretty big, I took voice lessons for a bit in college, and one of the first things my teacher worked on with me was good posture. It increases your airflow and let's you get some power from your diaphragm. Look up the Alexander Technique, music majors at my college actually had to take that as a class.  Since you're in a college group, I think it's safe to assume you've got at least 2-3 of each voice part? This is less for when you solo, but when you're blending, work with the other people in your voice part to stagger your breathing. If all of you take a gasp of air at once then there's a break in the sound, but if you stagger, then there is always at least one voice carrying the part.  This is more a long term fix, but maybe do some bearthing exercises or some cardio to help get your lung capacity up, I noticed it became a whole lot easier to sing at a concert volume for longer after I started getting in shape, core strength will help your sustain as well.   Hope it helped, break a leg at your show!"

Then I attended the quarterfinal at Johns Hopkins where Vocal Point was competing (who placed 3rd in finals). I think it's fair to say that any collegiate a cappella fan would expect them to win 1st. Instead the Faux Paz took the win and Vocal Point won 2nd. Both sets were incredible to watch.  If I had to predict this year's finalists, I would guess All The King's Men (who already made it to finals), Amazin' Blue, Faux Paz, Voices In Your Head, The Nor'easters, VirtuOSO, and SoCal VoCals.

I didn't see Sigma'cappella's set, but they beat the N'harmonics, who went to the finals in the Mid-Atlantic last year, so I'm really looking forward to seeing what made them stand out so much.

acappella,2xyftp,LOLSauce213,4,Wed Mar 4 22:41:23 2015 UTC,"Study vocal music. Look at a bunch of early influences like Gregorian chant, Notre Dame polyphony, Palestrina, Gesualdo, Bach chorales (!), and more modern influences like religious hymns, vocal jazz, and the modern choral repertoire. When I arrange, the first thing I try to accomplish is an arrangement that sings well. The vocal lines should be idiomatic (stepwise motion when possible). Another biggie for me is cleanliness of notation. Make sure your rhythms are beamed and flagged correctly. This will make a HUGE difference when the singers get the music in their hands. A rule of thumb for me is (in 4/4), make sure that beats 2 and 3 are separate beam groups (unless it's a half or whole note). This will help divide the measure in two for the singers - it'll be easier to sight-read that way."
acappella,2xyftp,crustysenor,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:14:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the cleanliness aspect. The formatting of an arrangement is just as important as the notes, especially for a new group. Strive for neatness and specificity."
acappella,2xyftp,rrichardjames,3,Thu Mar 5 23:18:55 2015 UTC,"Depending on your skill/experience with arranging, there are lots of things you can do! A couple ideas from things I've done recently:  -Vary your styles within an arrangement to keep it interesting. On the biggest scale, really good arrangers can play with the sound and go through different musical styles. But even just from one part of the song to another, you can change the sound from more rhythmic with lots of open space to full chords and lots of choral feeling. You can also achieve this with different vowels. (The core thing about this suggestion is knowing your instrument. Know the feeling that each vowel conveys and the sense of how things actually sound when sung. I know you know this, but among instruments when arranging, the voice comes out least like what you hear in your program.)  -Something else I've enjoyed doing recently is hiding little melodies from other songs in there if they have approximately the same chord progression--sometimes it takes a little editing of parts of the melody to make it work, but generally it comes out the same and people recognize it.  -Dynamics. Write them in. Balance out big crescendos with quiet sections. Given that you've got a solid backbone holding the piece together well, past that the more varied* you can get, the more you'll hold people's attention and they won't be able to turn away. (*Take ""varied"" with a grain of salt. Some groups definitely take it too far!)  Edit: Formatting"
acappella,2xyftp,AnOnlyMoose,2,Wed Mar 4 23:44:14 2015 UTC,"I've done on the order of 20-30 arrangements for my group, and would be happy to proofread for you.  A few tips: develop as a good an ear as you can, including music theory study. Can you immediately tell if a chord is major, minor, diminished, or augmented? Do you know how they function in tonal music? Which chords typically go to one another in different styles? Those sorts of things will make arranging go much more quickly."

I recently decided to try and track this song down. Turns out Rockapella's never done a Wonderwall cover near as I can tell. And the name Quisimodel doesn't appear ANYWHERE on the internet, except in scattered blog posts or playlists listing the track (including my old radio show on 89.7 KFJC!).  So, it's a mystery.

While it might suck that other more ""truly great"" groups aren't getting that mainstream spotlight, what I think is really cool about PTX's popularity is that it's raising a lot of awareness about acapella.  For every mass of people who get drawn in by PTX, there will always be a handful who become interested in acapella and seek those other groups out. I'd hope that some of those kids in that video become more interested in acapella after this, and maybe they'll go on to listen to other equally great groups or even join groups themselves!"
acappella,2wsy6g,SeptemberSky,5,Mon Feb 23 15:01:32 2015 UTC,"Could you by chance give examples?  I listen to almost exclusively acapella music and I've never found a group that could compete with pentatonix in terms of raw talent. Hell I can't even stand their genre of music and they're STILL the best I've found.  =\  I mean don't get me wrong, I've got literally everything VocalPoint, Spizzwinks, Melodores, Whiffenpoofs, King's Singers, Mills Brothers, VoCals, The Bobs, Moxy Fruvous, Davinci's Notebook, etc... have ever released simply because that's the genre I like, but frankly, none of them blow me away the way that Pentatonix tracks do even when it's an i-phone recording of them in a living room just dicking around performing a song that quite frankly I wouldn't like if they weren't performing it. Hell, Mitch and Scott did a collab with Shoshana Bean (Elphaba on broadway) in a living room and they were the ones that sounded amazing, not her...  =\"
acappella,2wsy6g,tehm,0,Mon Feb 23 18:21:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a graduate student in music composition and theory with five years choral experience (Choral/Solo/Jazz/Barbershop) including three years leading and composing for an acappella ensemble. I also play piano, percussion, saxophone, and erhu. I know music. I'm especially adept at picking out when an arrangement is doing something special. Pentatonix was quite good during The Sing-Off (though I preferred Sonos). Their arrangements were fresh and interesting and effectively integrated their EDM influences into each work without sacrificing depth. Their cover of Katy Perry's E.T. was particularly effective. However, since winning The Sing-Off, the quality of their arrangements has dropped off significantly. Their last really strong arrangement was probably the Gotye piece, if not the Daft Punk arrangement. I think their producers are reining them in to ensure their popularity, which is smart, but it doesn't lead to anything that's musically interesting. This is disguised by the production value as well as the excellent beatboxing, but transcription reveals the arrangements are almost entirely diatonic (there are almost no notes from outside the key). Any second year music theory student could write these, and that's no exaggeration, that's matter-of-fact.  I would have shown them this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV5__bujlyc  My understanding of the story behind this piece is that this girl uploaded herself singing and was out-of-tune so she was getting trolled. Cluster then decided to arrange a cover such that the girl, rather than sounding out of tune, sounded like the lead in a jazz arrangement. I'm not even a huge fan of jazz, but the kind of musical understanding required to write an effective cover like that is extreme. Also, even if its straying away from typical acappella, there's Roomful of Teeth whose performance of Partita for Eight Voices helped Caroline Shaw become the youngest woman to ever receive the prestigious Pulitzer Prize for Music. This is verging more towards art music, but it is still technically an ""a cappella ensemble"". If we're talking sheer talent, these guys have it in spades. This is just one of the movements from the work: http://youtu.be/1LlE41gvNcw Acapella doesn't have to be art music to be respectable, but there's a huge amount of extremely talented vocalists and composers out there who are not recognized because they don't condescend themselves to the constraints of popular music. I'd really like to see the Fine Brothers expose those people to this, as on top of being truly great art, there's a lot of meaning behind an entire world singing together: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WhWDCw3Mng"
acappella,2wsy6g,RiverStrymon,4,Mon Feb 23 23:46:15 2015 UTC,"Although Pentatonix is currently my favorite musical group, I'm upvoting you solely because I respect your opinion and your contribution to the conversation.  However, to expect that the Fine Bros expose these teenagers to what you rightfully believe to be much more excellent a cappella music might be asking for a bit much. Many of the videos, especially the ""React"" videos are made by the suggestions of their audience, and Pentatonix was definitely among the most popular suggestions. Neither the Fine Brothers, the teens, nor their audience have nearly enough musical background as you do, so they might not be able to appreciate and comment upon videos like the ones you suggested as much as we would like.   Also this video wasn't just about their music, but also about how they grew an even bigger audience through YouTube, which you could see evidently in how many people requested for them to make a react video on Pentatonix. YouTube is an ever-growing platform for media, and the Fine Bros probably wanted to show that through the story of Pentatonix. As far as I know, Pentatonix is only one of few artists who primarily gained their popularity through YouTube and other social media. It's a unique facet of their story which is worthy of highlight, although a facet that is of little concern for this subreddit.  Nonetheless, Pentatonix is worthy in their own right to receive recognition through this video, and like some have already said in this thread, hopefully this will be an avenue through which at least some people will explore and appreciate the wide world of a cappella that we all love very much."
acappella,2wsy6g,TrueJudgment,1 point,Wed Feb 25 01:03:28 2015 UTC,"This. I don't have nearly the amount of musical knowledge that you do, but I have been saying to everyone that I normally converse about a cappella with that the quality of Pentatonix arrangements have been dropping recently. I strongly feel that their earlier arrangements were much more intricate and technically impressive, however as you said their new material is still enjoyable to listen to due mainly to their vocal talent, production value, and solid vocal percussion."
acappella,2wsy6g,iamduh,3,Wed Feb 25 01:37:39 2015 UTC,"Have you been keeping up with PTX since the Sing-Off? I thought they got a lot of unfair dick-sucking while the show was on, but they have really developed their own style which works for them. It strikes a good balance between what they know is effective and trying to innovate.  I would personally prefer the sound of Backtrack, personally, for pleasure listening, but PTX are a perfectly great group. The other commenter also makes some good points about PTX helping other groups find fans by proxy."
acappella,2wm3xg,nathandavid13,2,Sat Feb 21 01:49:45 2015 UTC,"Are they high schoolers? If so, parental concerns will come in to play, but whether in school or college, I presume they've signed up to sing as a hobby, so you don't want them performing so much that their work suffers, as they may have to make a choice then, between study time and singing time, and you may end up on the losing side.  Other than that, don't have them gigging so much that they start to lose the love of it. They're still young enough that they're (presumably) doing it for fun, and you don't want to scare that out of them. And listen out for strain on their voices. Also the associated partying that comes with gigs can take a toll, so be mindful.  I used sing five-six times a day, six days a week for months on end when on tour, and it only became too much when the others started feeling and acting lethargically, the energy was gone from their performances, and started sniping at each other. Fuck me, I loved it, and would have gone on and on, but the others didn't have the love of it that I did. We were professional singers, so vocal fatigue and the like didn't really come in to it, it was more boredom and ennui from performing the same material so often. But it was trés hard to find time on the road to rehearse new material, and they just wanted to use the valuable down time to relax, so it was a bit of a catch 22. A day or two off was a godsend when we could find it, but it was rare."
acappella,2wm3xg,wet-paint,2,Sat Feb 21 03:40:23 2015 UTC,"Personal recommendation is for max of one per month. Sometimes our group will do one which promotes a competition in lead up ect, we toyed with busking on Saturdays regularly but getting the time for these things is a big deal. That being said not every month has to have a gig too. The group I am in for example has committed to 8 gigs and two competition/tour things and is fairly solid on holding that number. I think this is a decent option. (community choir 30guys 17-30)"
acappella,2wm3xg,Klinger_,2,Sat Feb 21 06:53:44 2015 UTC,"Performance experience is vital. Especially gigs where the acoustics suck. Singing out and learning to keep time [making eye contact] when no one can hear anyone else can make your group one that can perform well anywhere at any time.  That being said... Pick your battles wisely. Make sure that the battles you pick are the most beneficial for your group. Whether that be gigs that give your group more press, or whether it's a difficult gig with hosts that have little experience hosting and have hard spaces to sing in.  Gigs that push your group are gigs you want. But also consider the beneficial press other, easier gigs, give your group. It is very much a balancing act, and you should address the needs of your group with the gigs you accept. Obviously difficult, high exposure gigs are your cream. Always be accepting those when you can.   Schedules are hard to aline though! I've seen that first hand and it can't be helped. Just do your best. If you have the numbers then take the risk and do a gig as long as you have at least one or two per voice part.  Opportunities for experience and exposure are golden. If you don't give your audience as good a show as you know you can give, then at least your guys or gals who struggled will be able to pass on useful knowledge to the rest of the group in order to give that solid performance, regardless of circumstance.   Tl;dr: Don't be afraid to go out there at half power if you have to. You'll find that putting yourself in disadvantageous situations will make your members realize their ability to cope with differing circumstances. Trust yourselves to soak up experiences [good or bad] like a sponge to better yourselves for years to come.  Edit: Your group is young. My suggestions are in consideration of that, so that you'll have less anxiety from year to year when new members enter and old ones leave. Build a solid base so that your new members can easily see the golden road to solid, consistent performances."

Also interesting in part simply because historically their line-up almost always includes someone in it who will go on to be quite famous. Random Examples: in the late 90s a lot of their arrangements were by Bobby Lopez who went on to write the music for Frozen, Avenue Q, and Book of Mormon. Just a couple years prior they were written by Jonathon Coulton [Billboard #1 album, wrote the closing music for Portal 1+2], and a year before that they were written by Christophe Beck [Famous movie and TV composer.

Ithacappella - Say Something, Only When I Walk Away, Timshel    The G-Men - Skinny Love, Radioactive, Climax    The Pennharmonics - I Need Your Love (or just listen to the entire CD, which is great)    Bruin Harmony - Awake My Soul is still one of my favorites. Madness is good too.    The Hyannis Sound: Feeling Good, to start. Just listen to that entire performance, it is so consistently good. Essentially a collegiate ""super-group"".  And a few really good high school groups:  Vocal Rush - Probably know from the Sing-Off, but you should also listen to Let Us Be Loving    Forte - My Hat Is Awesome, Walking Out The Door, Uncharted Heart. They released an album full of originals, and it was ridiculously good. And they're releasing another one next week.    OneVoice - Here To Stay, Life Support, Drive All Night    Bonus recordings: UCLA Awaken - Gravity - Yes, this is Sara Bareilles. As far as I'm aware, this is the original version of the song. Acabelles - Blue Ocean Floor - This is such a good song, and there are so many good covers of this song, but this is the definitive one in my mind. Nor'Easters informal performance at LAAF 2014 - Elastic Heart is so good. I wish there was another recording of it.    Finally, a reminder that ""best of"" collections exist: Look for BOCA (e.g. BOCA 2015), Sing (e.g. Sing 11 - one louder), Voices Only (e.g. Voices Only 2014), Voices Only Forte (e.g. Voices Only Forte IV), etc. Here are two examples from Voices Only Forte IV: Jon Smith - Find You, Eric Sholz - Isabella of Castille"

acappella,2vte3q,zomgz0mbie,3,Sat Feb 14 07:44:15 2015 UTC,"I really wish this trend of SUPER processed A Cappella mixing would stop. They're an AMAZINGLY talented group!!! Why is everything so tuned, compressed, and overly polished?"
acappella,2vte3q,DFloMango,5,Sat Feb 14 09:44:09 2015 UTC,"Modern a cappella is starting to move down that trend a lot, simply because for many arrangements, they just try to transcribe the original instrumentation for songs. Which, for many groups, is a set-up to be an inferior imitation of the original song, rather than an alternative cover. The way to compensate for this, a lot of the time, is to make process it a ton so that, in some cases, the voices can't even be made out. Voices in Your Head are good at creating truly amazing covers that can really distinguish themselves from the originals. So are PTX. The Michigan G-Men as well. Those are just a few names.  But even they have a lot of super processed stuff. If you want an entire genre of virtually non-processed a cappella, you should definitely try checking out barbershop music (well, both barbershop and sweet adelines, which is the all female version). As a great introduction to the stuff, I'd recommend you check out three groups in particular: Vocal Spectrum, Ringmasters, and GQ (GQ is a sweet adelines group). At first, some of the style may feel repetitive or that it could get old quick, but I've found it to be more the opposite effect. As you listen to it more, you begin to get more hooked to it. Especially if you start singing in a quartet or chorus as well. Then you won't be able to stop listening to it or singing it--barbershoppers tend to love singing so much that they'll be ready to jam or sing tags with you at almost any time.  EDIT: I should note that I go an extremely a cappella-heavy school, yet even the people who really love singing won't be up to sing at any time. Barbershoppers will be up to sing with you, or with anyone really (credentials or status or reputation are not an object, even amongst some of the best barbershoppers), about 95% of the time. A big part of that is because in order to sing a lot of the stuff in the best way, you've gotta be bright and smiling (helps with the tone), and that just puts you in a good mood in itself. It's a vicious(ly wonderful) cycle."
acappella,2vte3q,sylinmino,2,Sat Feb 14 23:01:27 2015 UTC,"The answer to why everything is so tuned, compressed, and overly polished is more complicated. However, the reason that this particular track is so tuned, compressed, and polished is because the original song relies on exactly those same techniques for much of its success, and they/their producers want their cover to have the same effect.  For what it's worth, I spent ~8 years in barbershop before I even touched modern a cappella, so I definitely have an appreciation for the purity of vocal harmony. However, there's totally a time and place for both. A cappella is not and should not be a philosophy. When you start making rules about what a genre is and isn't allowed to be, you stifle its growth. Do that and you end up with the barbershop harmony society's current situation; Almost no modern hits (except Disney tunes) can be sung in a BHS competition because pop songs just don't follow the same formula that they used to (resolving around the circle of fifths, heavy use of dominant 7ths, etc.). That's why the vast majority of barbershop albums coming out these days only have maybe 2-3 contestable tracks on them, and everything else is ""not barbershop"" (also pretty much every major barbershop album in recent years has made use of pitch correction to make their albums ""perfect"". I dig it. It's fine for your live art and your recorded art to be different and optimized for each medium.)  I much prefer an anything-goes philosophy. If your music is generally vocal in origin and you want to call it a cappella, that's cool with me. I'll certainly make my own judgement as to whether I like it, find your production choices appropriate for what you're going for, etc.  Show me what you can come up with. The genre still has a long way to go to really establish itself with mainstream staying power (as opposed to being the disco of the 2010s). Please do something I've never heard before. Got cool new studio tricks up your sleeve? Awesome! If it's a top 40 tune, it could be great. On a choral ballad, maybe not so much.  Also to be clear, I'm totally with you on not loving studio wizardry to try and salvage bad music, but I probably wouldn't like it even if it were raw and pure either. However, I think this example video is a far cry from that and a completely tasteful application of modern production..."
acappella,2vte3q,rishel,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:17:39 2015 UTC,"That was a super awesome comment. Thank you for that!  My purpose wasn't to decry processing, tuning, or compression in GENERAL. I was mostly talking about this case, where it was done to the point of, in my opinion, actually DETRACTING from the performance and therefore all around sound of the final mix. The original had grit, noise, imperfections, phasing, detuning... This had hardly any of ANY of those.   So it leaves me wondering why. Editing it is absolutely an effective and reasonable means to an end to emulate modern music. But this particular mix, in my opinion, did a poor job of that. So it sort of seems like cake face makeup in a way.   I agree with you that this still constitutes as the genre of A Cappella. However, nowadays this sort of mixing is sort of becoming a cure-all for EVERY mix of EVERY group, and that to me signifies that it isn't a musical choice, but instead motivated by insecurity or an eschewing of the humanistic imperfections that make music MUSIC. I don't think the trend is occurring as a response to modern music trends so much as it is a side effect of inexperienced mixing, defunct opinions, insecure artists/producers, etc. THATS what I'm pointing out."
acappella,2vte3q,DFloMango,1 point,Tue Mar 17 12:54:02 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with you, but I don't on this particular track given what they were going for. If you want a cover of top 40 hit to sound as legit as the original in the same way as the original, you kind of have to approach it from the same angle.  The remarkable accessibility of a cappella is a double-edged sword. So many people can find a group among the thousands out there to join and make music which is great, but it also means a lot of amateur-ish level music is getting produced from these groups. However, everybody wants their recordings to sound professional, and I think producers are doing just about all they can with the inherent limitations on time/money/talent. I think it's a mistake to attribute what you don't like here to inexperienced mixing. While there are some not-so-great mixers, the guy that did this track is about as pro as you're gonna find. Rather, the super clean modern production with lots of tuning and effects is kind of the only thing a producer can do by the time the material gets to them to work on.  Again, I would not put this track or this group in that category, but that's just me. Given that you would (and that this would be considered at least good by most a cappella fans), I can understand how the vast majority of recorded a cappella doesn't do much for you (though that's true for me as well too haha)."
acappella,2vte3q,rishel,2,Sat Apr 4 20:42:56 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Agree to disagree and all that :)  However I don't think we're exactly disagreeing all that much. We seem to be approaching things from opposite sides of the same coin, just differing on our presuppositions.   End of story is we both love this style of music and hope to see it propagate further into the popular spectrum, and that's something I can get behind :)"

I'd fine tune that a bit and then bring it out a little bit more so that it's not overpowered by your tenor part.   Also, dynamics can be a powerful tool and help keep people interested. The beginning probably could have been just a bit more quiet.   Also, I'm not sure I necessarily agree with how the arrangement has the parts go during the chorus and I think longer notes could possibly be beneficial to the song as a whole, but that's just my personal preference.  This is all just nitpicking on an otherwise very solid first attempt. Can't wait to hear the finished product."
acappella,2v8cjf,Pokebunny,12,Sun Feb 8 21:47:59 2015 UTC,"Congrats to Pentatonix and Ben Bram!

""We recorded this in a bedroom closet, filmed it in the kitchen, and now we’re winning a Grammy. It just goes to show that anything is possible.""  I think the greatest complement that was given to this recording was how many people accused them of cheating with digital effects, layering or auto-tune. :)  Edit: Should also mention that Pentatonix had two other high honors:  1) They performed a Bee Gees medley at the Clive Davis pre-Grammy gala. The performers for the party are hand-picked by Clive Davis himself. They were the last act, followed by Barry Gibb (last surviving member of the Bee Gees) singing a final song. Pretty high honor.  2) They will be presenting an award on the Televised Grammys tonight (their award was at a livestreamed event at another venue).  Pretty amazing to go from reality TV winners to a Grammy Award plus presenting at the Grammys in only three years. I think part of it you have to chalk up to them being really good, genuine people. You don't present at the Grammys that quickly unless people in the music industry like you."

Sac, Northeastern.  Now I'll grant you Mt. Sac shouldn't make the list. (Wait, who the hell is Mt. Sac? They're a tiny little community college that upset everyone because, well... they had Avi Kaplan (pentatonix) on bass and Joe Caigoy (filharmonic) doing lead.) but leaving the VoCals off seems a little... odd."

acappella,2tm84o,FFXZeldagames,5,Sun Jan 25 15:02:43 2015 UTC,"Mastering a cappella music for loudness is very hard. There is no one trick that I use - every situation is different.   Two very important basic concepts that immediately come to mind:   Some parts of the audible frequency spectrum are more powerful to the human ear (sound louder) than others. See fletcher-munson curves: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher%E2%80%93Munson_curves Limiter distortion is often the most obvious when the limiter is reacting to sustained material like vocal pads. Some textural diversity in the mix can go a very long way.   Hope that helps. Have fun, and be patient with yourself - this kind of thing takes a lot of trial end error.  -Eric Scholz http://ericscholzproductions.com/ https://www.facebook.com/ericscholzprod"

acappella,2tm84o,autowikibot,0,Sun Jan 25 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"If it's just not loud enough, then the limiter isn't being worked right. If the limiter is barely kicking in, then your mix may be too dynamic--quiet parts quiet, loud parts barely causing any action at the limiter.   If you're afraid that working your limiter will make it sound processed (which is a subjective and not very productive assessment anyway), you might have some settings off. If you're creating something remotely pop/rock, you should be able to get to competitive levels without hearing the limiter too much.  As for making a mix sound bigger, consider the illusion you're creating. What kind of space are the voices in? You can make something seem louder than it would be dry by creating the illusion that the sound was very loud in a big space--reverb and delay in particular. Loudness and bigness are not always (or I daresay ever) an issue of sheer volume.  Edit: I said ""without hearing the limiter too much."" I don't think you should notice the limiting unless you're just smashing the sound on purpose. Good luck tweaking!"

Even if they're 100% tone deaf, even if we know from the first 2 seconds there's not a chance he'll ever get let in (we're all male).   Whatever you do, don't let this discourage you. Life is full of auditions that didn't go perfectly, but what makes life kick ass is when you hit the ground running and smiling. That means trying to improve yourself however you can, and giving it another shot next time an opportunity arises. Good luck!"

acappella,2t4or8,FFXZeldagames,1 point,Wed Jan 21 05:54:20 2015 UTC,"It could have meant a lot of things. I know if my group knew off the bat that a candidate wasn't right, we'd skip the latter half of the audition to save time for ourselves and for the auditionee. No point in putting them through the whole thing if we know after 30 seconds that they're not right.  ""Not right"" doesn't necessarily mean bad.  Maybe they were just a voice part that we were already bloated with, or their attitude wasn't what we were interested in. Maybe they were too attractive and we didn't want them making the rest of us look bad (Kidding! :P)   Depending on a myriad factors, you probably were just not what they were looking for at this exact juncture- the fact that it's the spring REALLY lends itself to this.  Usually spring auditions are just to plug up a hole where someone just left in the middle of the year. I'd do two things:  1) Ask your friends (ones you can trust to be honest) to listen to your audition and give you honest feedback for your next audition.  2) Email the Musical Director of the group and say something to this effect- ""Hey! Thanks for the great opportunity to audition for your group. If you can remember, can you give me some constructive feedback about what I can do to improve my chances in the future?""  Either way, if you want to get in, I highly encourage you to audition again in the fall. Go to their shows, like their facebook statuses (the page, not the individual members), show them that you care about the group even though you're not in it, ask to sell CDs at their next concert."

acappella,2t0r98,nairebis,9,Tue Jan 20 05:08:46 2015 UTC,"As much as I love the talent showed here, frankly, we already knew that about them.  What blows ME away is listen to this, then listen to them doing the same song with Avi and Kevin then listen to practically any other PTX track...  The ""PTX Sound"" really IS theirs. I have no doubt that ben bram and deke sharon and whoever coached them up a little bit but this arrangement (and the others they did as a trio) are basically what convinced me that PTX really is just the merging of the trio Scott, Mitch, and Kirstie already had with the ridiculous rhythm section that is Avi + Kevin.  TL;DR as much as I like them as technical singers I like their arrangements better than anyone else in the a cappella world right now by a WIDE margin and I'm convinced that they're the ones doing it."
acappella,2t0r98,tehm,3,Tue Jan 20 21:46:44 2015 UTC,"I think what I liked most about this performance was how effortless and easy they make it look. They're relaxed, smiling, doing their little hand choreography, jumping around, stomping, etc, like they're just screwing around in the band room. There isn't the slightest hint of fear that they're going to screw it up.  I think the hidden ""secret weapon"" that we don't see is how much work they put in behind the scenes to make it seem that effortless. You just can't have the level of polish we see here or the level of polish we see in PTX recordings/videos/concerts without a hell of a lot of work and practice. They hold themselves to an incredibly high standard, and you can see the roots of that here."

acappella,2sw0mu,mysticalscorpion,1 point,Mon Jan 19 01:50:51 2015 UTC,"Hey there,  Yeah, there's a pretty vibrant scene here. I'm based in Waterford, and am in a bunch of ensembles, but if you're up for meeting other likeminded people, the easiest way is to join a decent choir that competes, and go to a festival, or even just go yourself, if you're that keen. Cork is the biggest, and it's a cracking weekend, but there's Navan, Sligo, Castlebar, Derry, and others. Go on the beer with a bunch of other people who like singing, it's great craic. If you're college age, try out for hte Irish Youth Choir. I heartily recommend it, it's an intensive residential weekend learning shit loads of repertoire, partying hard, and touring the country doing concerts. The IYCC also records albums, sings at Electric Picnic, and sings athe BBC Proms. Funtastic.   Again, if you're in college, most colleges will have a society you can join, but it can be a mixed bag, talent and organisaiton wise. But set one up if you need to, I set up a Barbershop quartet in college recently, and a chamber choir in my last college."

acappella,2saphh,michaelmarcus,1 point,Tue Jan 13 17:03:14 2015 UTC,What is it with RARB and Pentatonix? Why are they so totally ignored (not even reviewed!) on that site? How can you ignore the most successful a cappella group when choosing the best of the year?
acappella,2saphh,Aloisiusblog,6,Wed Jan 14 11:02:46 2015 UTC,"As far as I understand it, RARB don't generally choose what to review - you submit your album for review yourself, providing copies to the board. That's standard practice not just at RARB, but at any review outlet - if the board (let alone the reviewers!) had to invest money into the products, this could lead to a bias. So RARB didn't ignore PTX, but PTX ignored RARB.  So far for the objective stuff, I'll now offer some of my subjective opinion... Starting with something I would actually consider fairly objective. Successful doesn't mean good. Yes, PTX without a doubt are the most successful group based on record sales, but that doesn't mean they're the best. Dan Brown's books sell millions of copies, but that doesn't mean he's the best author out there either. So with that in mind, I'll open myself up to what might become a heated debate... I'm not a huge fan of PTX from a critical standpoint. Yes, they make fun music, and they do a decent job with their arrangements - but to my ear, the pieces are all very interchangeable, almost predicable. This has gotten better recently, but I still think they're rather limited in their artistic vision. I'll compare it to a group that I admittedly am a big fan of, but who has also been included in the picks of the year with their last five albums, as well as the picks of the decade: maybebop. You might not have heard of them if you're based in America, even in their home Germany they're not overly well known outside the scene. But they have scored perfect 5/5 reviews on RARB multiple times, despite singing in German. Because RARB doesn't look to record sales, but artistic merit. PTX to me still resemble an (admittedly extremely professional) college group, because they still mostly perform covers, most of which are of current top 40 hits. Their style, as mentioned above, is very polished, but also inflexible - simply the inclusion of a dedicated beatboxer severely limits them stylistically (and I'm saying this having been effectively a dedicated VP myself for a while). Maybebop on the other hand perform almost exclusively originals, no top 40 covers except the odd one for their YouTube channel only. They effortlessly switch between electro pop, folk song, all flavours of jazz, rock opera, humour song... You name it, they excel at it. Four guys, masterful and creative arranging, an unreal range of styles all flawlessly executed, always at the forefront of a cappella culture exploring new frontiers. Yes, I'm a huge fan of theirs, so by all means take my words with a grain of salt. But there's a reason they have been one of the most critically acclaimed group in the world for a while now, even if they don't sell platinum records. Because critical and commercial acclaim are two unrelated measures.   I hope I didn't bring too much personal bias into this text, if you've got any questions or issues with my argumentation I'd love to hear them.  Aca-love <3"
acappella,2saphh,drehz,1 point,Wed Jan 14 12:34:57 2015 UTC,"Maybebop are great, no doubt, and really versatile. That is certainly a big point for them. But versatility is not an essential skill, if you ask me. Saying that Daft Punk are not so great because they tend to do mostly techno is a bit ridiculous. I think there is space for both things, a versatile group like maybebop that breaks barriers and the mainstream group that caters to the general public with top 40 type of music. And I do think PTX are ""artistically"" good in their own arena.  I did not know how RARB worked, and I can understand now why PTX is not there. I feel that PTX are trying to distance themselves from the acappella scene, as this sort of limits them, puts them in a niche. That's how I understand it."
acappella,2saphh,Aloisiusblog,3,Wed Jan 14 14:16:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with your point, versatility isn't essential. But if you're saying PTX are distancing themselves from the aca scene, I would disagree. They are involved in things like a cappella academy and as far as I can tell very much aware of their roots. They don't have to be perceived as an a cappella act to be successful in the mainstream, but they can elevate that scene with their presence. Besides, covering top 40 is very much part of the a cappella niche - if they really wanted to distance themselves, they would focus on originals instead of having them be more of an afterthought like it is the case now. Finally, if you're going to argue PTX are distancing themselves from the aca scene, your whole point about RARB omission is moot :)"
acappella,2saphh,drehz,2,Wed Jan 14 15:10:25 2015 UTC,"Complete pentatholic here.   To be honest, I feel like it goes without saying how good your album is once it's gone platinum and you've been nominated for a Grammy.   I doubt PTX is too broken up about being skipped over by RARB in favor of promoting who don't find much press anywhere else."
acappella,2saphh,Renix,3,Wed Jan 14 12:12:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can qualify a good album as one that has gone platinum.   ""Duck The Halls: A Robertson Family Christmas"" and ""Who Let The Dogs Out"" both went platinum."
acappella,2saphh,PupAndSuds20,4,Wed Jan 14 15:24:33 2015 UTC,"I currently write for RARB.  RARB reviews only what is sent to us.  The only albums eligible for Picks of the Year are those that we reviewed this year. Each reviewer can select from only the albums that he/she personally reviewed in that year.  We would love to review Pentatonix-- or any one of the other countless groups that's not currently reviewed on RARB.  If you're in a group, we encourage you to send in your albums or songs for review-- and encourage your friends to do the same!"
acappella,2s768b,the_tailor,12,Mon Jan 12 20:06:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't exactly consider Scott Hoying a star in his own right. The producers of the show tried to make him ""the face"" of the group, but since then PTX has really moved away from solo-centric rep. I feel like that's what they've wanted to do from the beginning.  With Austin it is a bit different; I think Home Free needs a leading man like him, whereas everyone in PTX is irreplaceable in their own way. That's what makes PTX so intriguing/successful."
acappella,2s768b,rrichardjames,2,Mon Jan 12 22:30:19 2015 UTC,"Do you think Hoying could have had a solo career? I do... I wouldn't say that about the other members of PTX, although I agree with you that their model is not solo-centric, which is wonderful."
acappella,2s768b,rrichardjames,2,Mon Jan 12 22:43:22 2015 UTC,"I think Scott would do well, but not significantly better than Mitch, Avi, or Kevin - in fact, Kevin has arguably the biggest solo career of the 5 with his viral cello/beatbox vids. Overall I think Scott (or any of them) would lose more from leaving PTX than he would gain from going solo - at least at this point."

acappella,2s768b,alien_observer,1 point,Tue Jan 13 01:14:43 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to start off by saying I totally agree with you about Scott. I think he's the only member of PTX that doesn't need the other four to succeed, but they certainly help.    I've been trying to think about it, but the only other name that comes to mind is Amy Whitcomb.  She sang ""Think"" with BYU Noteworthy (which is when I fell in LOVE with her) in season 1. She had a solo career and a career with her band ""The Whits"" before she returned to the show in Season 3 with Delilah- dropping absolutaly disgusting vocals on ""Grenade."" She went on to appear on The Voice and I believe she is still pursuing a career in music."

I was always interested in hearing his rendition of Let It Go in particular so that was pretty awesome.  And I gotta give a special nod to Colleen for having an equally impressive voice! I had not heard her singing videos and only know her other persona, which I never watched more than a clip or two. I was so pleasantly surprised, she's got great range and power. After this video came out, I had to go look up some of her other videos and I am glad I did. New fan! Also, beautiful teeth.   Thanks for making the music Pete!"

acappella,2rt61e,Not_MyCabbages,1 point,Fri Jan 9 21:29:12 2015 UTC,"They do sound good live. I've seen them a couple of times. But, in a cappella, there IS something special to the ""studio"" sound where there is greater harmonic control."
acappella,2rt61e,Pokebunny,1 point,Fri Jan 9 23:31:44 2015 UTC,"Studio sound is different. It allows you to accentuate bass/beatboxing, record everything repeatedly until it sounds exactly how you want it, add texture that is otherwise impossible to get - definitely a different sound. But that doesn't mean you can record well when you can't sing well, and for the vast majority of acappella, editing is used to enhance, not to create something that isn't already there.  I think both have their upsides and sound great, really. There are some things that you can do really well with a studio sound and some things that just sound better with an ""authentic"" live sound."
acappella,2rt61e,Pokebunny,2,Sat Jan 10 04:01:22 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of all that. :) Hence, the ""special"" part. haha.   I think it's unfair to say something is ""good"" or not depending on whether or not it is live or studio. They're two completely different animals, ya? When Kirstie and I recorded duets a long time ago, we actually found that it was more frustrating to record because it also accentuated faults that were forgiving during our live performances.   I would say you're right, of course, about the ""you can't add what's not already there"" point. I just find myself never enjoying live performances of a cappella as much as a studio version. Whereas, I can enjoy instrumental performances (I mean Rock/Electronica/etc. not necessarily just classical) live for their ""rough""ness.  I think PTX performs with in ears... So, when I've seen them live, their harmonies are usually spot on. But, when you're moving around, doing choreography, there's no way each chord is going to be balanced and tuned exactly right each time. And, that, for me, is what I want in a cappella singing. Precise tuning for the style and chord. So, very often, the best parts of the PTX shows for me are the individual acts (celloboxing, jokes, humor, etc.), the still song (where they sing a ballad without movement), and texting Mitch while he's backstage dirty things. :P hahah."

acappella,2rril9,Lefty21,7,Thu Jan 8 18:35:13 2015 UTC,"I think this comes from the fact that most A Cappella people started in High School or College, where a massive outburst following a sick drop, or nasty run is commonplace and seen as supportive. Some people just take that kind of stuff to extremes. This also might be due to the fact that it's Pentatonix, and they have some DIE HARD crazy fans out there.  I saw Edge Effect a few years ago, as well as Overboard and had minimal problems hearing what they were singing."
acappella,2rril9,ansible_jane,1 point,Thu Jan 8 21:09:12 2015 UTC,"That's basically the only thing keeping me from going to a Pentatonix show, one of my friends went and told me he basically couldn't understand anything due to all the screaming.

acappella,2rril9,thecriclover99,2,Fri Jan 9 17:24:09 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly.

Fun facts about this: we wrote this song for The Sing Off in the week before the show (it was going to be the battle song, before it got cut). We decided to go in a very different direction with this song and do trap, because DJ and I were going through a trap phase and thought it would be cool. We rehearsed the battle with the Melodores, and (needless to say) combining theirs and our arrangements was completely hilarious. We couldn't stop laughing at how ridiculous it was between runs.

acappella,2pn38o,tehm,9,Thu Dec 18 03:20:43 2014 UTC,"Yessss PTX.  So glad to see them on TV. Can't wait for Home Free. Also, did anyone else catch the Filharmonic in the audience? They'd be good to see on stage tonight."
acappella,2pn38o,previsualconsent,7,Thu Dec 18 03:14:43 2014 UTC,"The Exchange...  YES! Brilliant energy, and each soloist was capable. Bass and VP were strong, and that harmony moment was great!"
acappella,2pn38o,mrfunktastik,3,Thu Dec 18 02:46:49 2014 UTC,These guys are going to win I am sure.
acappella,2pn38o,Fleurr,5,Thu Dec 18 03:00:16 2014 UTC,"They definitely seem the group that was put together to win it anyways; the bass that formed the group was like the major arranger behind the scenes last season.  EDIT: And the Exchange wins! As much as I'd love The Melodores to win (I'm from TN) they logistics of it make it impossible (they simply can't stay together, tour, and record as the contract requires) and there's no way that Traces beats The Exchange.  EDIT2: Holy SHIT!!! Didn't call that! No idea how the hell they're going to get them for the tour but kudos to Vandy!"
acappella,2pn38o,w0lfpwn,3,Thu Dec 18 03:08:54 2014 UTC,Yeah crazy didn't really think they could win. I didn't think there was a recording contract just a cash prize.
acappella,2pn38o,mrfunktastik,3,Thu Dec 18 03:59:48 2014 UTC,Ahh! Didn't know they changed the prize structure this year. If they aren't required to tour and record it makes perfect sense then.
acappella,2pn38o,PurryMurris,6,Thu Dec 18 04:04:54 2014 UTC,I feel like it might be the only reason why they won.

acappella,2pn38o,Niksmart1a,3,Thu Dec 18 02:58:41 2014 UTC,I dunno. It seemed like there wasn't a lot of variety in their arrangement. But their percussion and bass were intense.

That was a couple hours of emotional rollercoaster right there."
acappella,2pn38o,Fleurr,10,Thu Dec 18 03:59:04 2014 UTC,Hey guys! Beatboxer from the Melodores here! Hope you guys enjoyed the show! We had a blast performing in front of that audience and it was amazing to win and feel the energy from the crowd.
acappella,2pn38o,12jalyons,4,Thu Dec 18 06:20:46 2014 UTC,"You guys did great! Your sololist for Take Me To Church (Dan? I think?) killed it. While the entire group was fantastic, I think his vocal was what gave you the edge over The Exchange."
acappella,2pn38o,KayakNinja,3,Thu Dec 18 06:30:58 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, Dan is a GREAT singer, and he presented the song so well with his emotions.  The judges loved having a college group be so serious after the happy fun song we sang in the first round, so I think that juxtaposition of song choices really helped our cause! Traces and The Exchange both killed their second round songs as well though, don't get me wrong!"

No harmonies, and the background didn't gel as well as I hoped. However, that bass though! Very impressive for an all-female group."

The front row seats right in the middle opened up 2 days before the show, which was also my bday.   Suffice to say, it was a freaking great show. Not so lucky this year, front row balcony seats, so hopefully won't be too horrible.   Street Corner Symphony, which were my favorite to win that year, will be there with Vocal Point from last year. I imagine they will also have whoever wins tonight and 1 other group from the area."
acappella,2pn38o,ollness,3,Thu Dec 18 02:38:45 2014 UTC,I think the Exchange just showed they're about to win this thing.

I'm not even that big of a Fall Out Boy fan but there's just something about his mannerisms that just make me go ""D'awwww..."" and he's a pretty good judge once some of the nerves went away."
acappella,2pn38o,LtDan61350,5,Thu Dec 18 03:31:42 2014 UTC,"Okay I know Trace didn't really merit a win but can we talk about their contralto? When they started their first song, I was calling an octavizer from the start. Wow was I wrong."

acappella,2pi5yi,TangerineX,1 point,Wed Dec 17 08:20:44 2014 UTC,"I think it was partly the arrangement and partly the singing. It sounded a lot like multiple people singing different songs at once.   For one, make a clearer distinction between song switches. It sounds like when people are switching songs, not everyone has switched all at once. Another thing you could do is keep the harmonies closer together. I noticed you have quite a bit of range in your arrangement, but with only 4 people, tighter harmonies tend to work better.  For singing, a bit more attention to blending would be nice."
acappella,2pi5yi,webaddictress,1 point,Sat Dec 20 21:15:56 2014 UTC,"Thanks for that. I aimed to have people singing different songs at once, just because there was a lot to cover and I thought it worked quite nicely, but I can understand that it may have come across confused and messy. I also understand the need for clearer distinction and the closer harmonies is definitely something I will work on for the future!  Since we're a very new group, I think blending is something that will come with time, more singing together, etc. Thanks for the reply though. It's good to get that feedback."

acappella,2orbgn,wet-paint,2,Tue Dec 9 21:42:17 2014 UTC,"If you just call something 'Choral Music' as in  ""Oh I saw this Choral music concert last night""  If we didn't have other words for different types of singing, it would be unclear what you meant. Gospel Choir, Vocal Jazz, Contemporary a cappella, barbershop, are all very different. The different names just make it more clear when you're talking about the music.   I'm in music school and when we refer to the Chamber choir we say things like ""Oh today in choir rehearsal blah blah blah"" and ""We sang xyz song in a cappella rehearsal""  It's just a matter of clarity."
acappella,2orbgn,Nolongerlurkin,1 point,Wed Dec 10 01:59:30 2014 UTC,"Maybe a better way of phrasing what I mean is - I don't understand why the term a cappella has been rehashed in to something else. As far as I can see, what people are referring to is pop repertoire, right? Small ensembles, vocal percussion added, but as far as I can see it's pop music, arranged for voice. I can't see how you wouldn't describe that as choral music, why you'd feel the need to use another term, especially one which is already used to describe the more general field being spoken of. It seems needlessly confusing.  I'm in music school too, meant to be studying Beethoven and Haydn's symphonies for an exam in six hours, but talking about this."

acappella,2obdtn,Not_MyCabbages,2,Fri Dec 5 00:42:18 2014 UTC,"First off, well done for being a few months old!! Just some quick things I noticed, maybe to be taken with a grain of salt.  -The baritone (far left in the red and grey, I'm assuming that's you?) vowels need to be a little darker/warmer. Your pitch is pretty consistently right where it needs to be, but listen to this with a good sound system and you can hear that part standing out a little too much the entire time. (For example, compare to the alto [cream jacket], whose part I can't readily distinguish from the rest of the background most of the time.) It's not just a volume issue, but that the way those bari vowels are being formed in the mouth makes them a little tinnier than they should be for best blending. For me, that was the easiest fix that would really affect your overall sound.  -The VP (beatbox) bass kick should have a little more weight/staying power behind it. It may just not be carrying over into the video from live performance, but what comes through is a little too much of a ""pop"" and not enough of a ""boom"", if that makes sense. Think big tom drums (look ~1:28) that resonate for a little bit when struck, less wood block. (I don't want that to come off the wrong way--your VP is good and precise, but it's just that his bass drum kick could have some more power behind it. Try having him add a slower, more consistent stream of air blown out while maintaining that burst with the actual drum strike sound. [Hope that makes sense.])  -Last thing--and this may just be personal preference--I don't think you need the theatrics at the very very end with the squatting and unaccompanied fadeout. If you really want to keep it, find some way to make it more convincing through incorporating more like that earlier in the song. I just felt it sort of came from nowhere because the group was doing so well without that sort of thing.  Overall, really good job for a group so young! Definitely keep it up! :] Edit: formatting"

acappella,2o9sxy,kcirbaj,3,Thu Dec 4 16:41:50 2014 UTC,"A few thoughts:   Combination of things. Until you have contracts with serious buyers, you'll very likely need a rig to take with you. PACs will have a tech who can run sound, but the quality varies, both in the available techs and house systems. If the house system rocks, use it. Otherwise, make sure you've got something powerful enough for the rooms you plan to play in. Main system should push 10-20 watts per person of venue capacity. System: Get active (powered) speakers. 2 mains, 1-2 subs, 2-3 floor wedges (powered also), and a mixer (board). Digital will be best because you can recall your settings, but an analog board will be much cheaper (Mackie, Yamaha, etc.); however an analog board won't have the same flexible options for processing. Since you have powered speakers, you only have to run mic cables from the board to all the speakers. No separate amps and speaker cables. This makes life way easier.    Mics. If you have $8,000 to get quality wireless mics, do that. Otherwise, save yourself the headache of using cheap wireless and buy SM58s, or comparable Sennheiser, Audix (OM8), or whatever wired mics. If you're doing serious choreography and need wireless mics, I just don't even know. I do know that crappy wireless mics can ruin a performance.   The above setup (with bad wireless mics) is under $10K. Depending on options, you might get by for under $5K, and if you buy used or find great deals, you might even do it for under $2.5K.   Source: Am a professional a cappella singer and sometimes travel with a setup quite like the above.  For reference, the Presonus StudioLive (which we use in our setup) series boards are good. The Graphic EQ (on the main out) is pretty lousy, but a good EQ shouldn't be too expensive."

acappella,2ntwwb,zomgz0mbie,1 point,Sun Nov 30 08:09:25 2014 UTC,"This is a very open-ended question haha. Has your group gone to the competition in the past? If not, is there a group on your campus that has gone to the competition? Comparing your arrangements to theirs might be a good place to start. I would not worry about the quality of your arrangements when compared to other groups at ICCA's. In the one year that I've competed, overall the level of ""difficulty"" or ""originality"" in the arrangements varied widely and did not exactly correspond with level of success.  Some tips in general for arranging: do not make things complicated for the sake of sounding ""cool"" or complex. You should have a vision for your arrangement and how it differs from the original song, and elaborate on those differences in ways that are interesting/ cohesive with your set as a whole. Is there a good music school on your campus? Any music majors in your group? You could run the arrangement by a member of the choral faculty and see if they have any constructive criticism.  Choreo is definitely not my area of expertise. My group's choreo two years ago was way too ""show-choiry"" and the judges thought it was distracting. Keep it simple and focus on moving from one cool picture onstage to the next with some uncomplicated arm and body movements mixed in. Lining up big moves on big musical moments is also a huge plus, both for the judges and the crowd. If you have show choir in your area you could seek help from a student choreographer who I'm sure would be happy to help you for super cheap or even no cost. If you can't find outside help my suggestion would be to simply watch a lot of videos of successful groups and try to mimic the overall patterns they seem to follow.  Hope this helped! feel free to ask any other questions you may have"

If you have the drive and determination, please, ignore my dumbass and make this happen.   What I'd do is approach the director of this musical and propose making an a cappella musical.  They'd have to re-write some stuff and it might take a year or 2 to make happen, but it'd be an awesome take on musicals that harnesses all the strengths of the people involved and it could really work.   But if we're talking suggestions: Chicago."

I even think that these types of songs (vocal/instrumentation heavy) are usually better, seeing as vocals is kinda the name of the game.   You should, however, solve your problem now instead of waiting for talent to come your way. My group had a line of some star perc talent, no joke. But we had, at any time, four options for who might beatbox a song. When we didn't need our star perc, we spread the responsibility around. That's what I would suggest to you. Your group has no one really great beatboxer? Make four people learn. One of them will probably get really good and maybe love it.

acappella,2luyyg,torma616,1 point,Mon Nov 10 17:26:26 2014 UTC,"I mean, the reality is that the show got changed because it wasn't very successful last season. If it was on the upswing I'm sure they wouldn't condense a formula that was working."
acappella,2luyyg,Pokebunny,6,Mon Nov 10 19:50:36 2014 UTC,"The show was popular in season 1, and then came back even bigger in season 2. The show was popular in season 2, and came back even bigger in season 3. Season 3 was arguably the most successful season; hell, PTX won that year. So what did they do? They cancelled it. They cancelled the show WHEN IT WAS ON AN UPSWING!  And when fans were upset by this decision, they brought it back... to season 1 status. And now they're condensing it even more and weren't able to secure the (IMO, one that is shared by almost everybody I've talked to who watches the show) most popular judge.  This move just sounds to me like NBC is trying to kill off the show; they're trying to do things so that when they cancel it next time, people won't want them to bring it back."
acappella,2luyyg,torma616,1 point,Mon Nov 10 20:32:48 2014 UTC,The third season was actually unsuccessful as well. The ratings went down because they extended the season so long that people stopped watching.

They had success with the first two seasons and thought that would translate to a full fall season, but it didn't. Because love it as we might, it's still a ""niche"" show. Now an intelligent executive should've said, ""Ok, we'll go back to the Christmas season-only run."" No. Some idiot said ""Well, we tried and failed. Lets cancel it."" So after being off the air, it lost momentum and didn't get NBC they're pre-cancellation ratings in Season Four. It's like NBC only sees two settings ""needs to be bigger"" and ""needs to be cancelled."" If everything had just stayed the same for season three, The Sing Off could've been a lovely, yearly, Christmas season NBC staple. But they messed with it too much and have unrealistic expectations."

acappella,2l6sms,Mrunclesam,1 point,Tue Nov 4 03:38:11 2014 UTC,I thought they always did Run To You off mic? It's a typical a cappella thing to have an off mic song and that song was usually their off mic one.
acappella,2l6sms,blakrazor,3,Tue Nov 4 03:44:16 2014 UTC,They do it off mic if the venue suits it acoustically. Aka if the sound will naturally reach the back of the house.

acappella,2l4i24,mouthdrummer,3,Mon Nov 3 03:12:52 2014 UTC,"A more sensitive condenser mic with a bit of compression will brighten up your sound considerably if you can manage it.  In terms of EQ, it really depends on how your producing the sound.  The 'pop' your talking about it going to be a combination of the lower frequency punch (probably around 500-1kHz) and higher crackle (4-8kHz), thats where I would start.  Again, the real fix is probably a microphone with a more aggressive response.  The 58 works great with an overdriven guitar amp but unless your really pushing some air its going to be hard to get the punchy sound your looking for out of it."
acappella,2l4i24,Jmgilson,2,Mon Nov 3 07:56:13 2014 UTC,"This is for studio recordings, but these notes from Tony Huerta (mixes Take 6) are super useful for beatboxing EQ:  From http://www.sonicaudiopro.com/#/blog/shure-notes-and-tony-huerta/  Vocal Kick Microphone Placement  All you care about at this point is the EQ the mic puts out. The microphone should reproduce a clear low end below 80Hz without coloring the sound with wind noise off the artist’s mouth, and reproduce the EQ of the beater smack of a real kick with an EQ peak around 5-7 kHz.  Have the percussionist hold this microphone in his dominant hand and work with the angle of attack on the mic to find the best on/off axis sound.  You’ll know the EQ is right when the sub pumps and the smack takes your head off.  EQ it just like a Kick Drum.  Vocal Snare EQ and Microphone Placement  Next, let’s work on the snare.  This is probably the most important component of all the percussion tracks.  Focus on the specific EQ of a real snare drum and you can’t go wrong. “Focus on the specific EQ of a real snare drum and you can’t go wrong.” I break it down as the three EQ areas that make up a complex snare sound; 250 Hz – 900 Hz for the body of the snare sound, 2.5 KHz – 4.0 KHz for the smack of the stick on the skin, 6 KHz and up for the sizzle of the actual snares on the bottom of the drum.  Picking the microphone that best suits your style of song is key here.  For instance, if I’m going for a classic 80s snare sound, I would pick the mic that best represents 250 Hz for the body, 2.5 KHz for the smack without a lot of sizzle.  I choose between several different microphones for the snare; usually dynamic instrument mics that I’d usually use on a real snare or on congas in a live show.  I use them straight on the mouth and have the artist touch lips to the mic in very close proximity held in their non-dominant hand.  Although it’s vocal, these artists can really make a full bodied snare sound with just their mouths."

acappella,2kj8t8,blay12,2,Tue Oct 28 03:21:11 2014 UTC,"You've got some good stuff going on, but you can take the contrast further. Think really simple: register and rhythm. Some low hanging fruit would be to ditch the ""oh"" whole notes in the ""don't go crying..."" bridge section to really establish that something new is happening. If you have a hard time shifting the register from section to section, consider substituting close voicings for more open ones, or vice versa. Make it obvious.  You've got a lot happening in the backgrounds, but not much of it comes off as ""catchy"" - like a line, a riff, or a motif could. What you've got going on ends up sounding more meandering than purposeful.  On a micro level, if you're more sparing and intentional with the color notes/chords, they'll have greater impact when they do happen. I'm personally not the biggest fan of the 9th on top @1:05, resolving a half step up to the 5th of the next chord... The 9 on a minor chord like that is a little too spooky sounding for me because of its close relationship to the 3rd, but sticks out especially since it's in an outer voice.  Anyways, I like your ideas and always appreciate when folks want to take songs in a new direction. Looking forward to see where you go with it!"

Because it's such a heavily covered song, and kind of running on popularity fumes, I tried to change it up a little bit to keep it fun and really contrast the sections.   I did a quick recording of it for them as a kind of proof of concept, which they liked, but I'm still not totally sold on it (and please ignore the fact that I forgot to record the bass line, leaving it as a MIDI track with an electric bass VST...whoops!).

acappella,2jizmj,Wavepermlovedog,2,Mon Oct 20 06:36:44 2014 UTC,"Ugh, right? Yet groups keep wanting to do it. I've been trying to avoid the past few things Paramore has done, but just recently I had someone ask me to arrange this one for them. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the song and I love Paramore, but there's just not much you can do with some of their songs unless you put in a lot of changes, and sometimes those changes don't work. I think the group I had to do it for liked what I did, but it's definitely not my favorite arrangement project. Plus, no matter how much you change the song, you can't do it without a crowd clapping ""don't go cryin"" moment, and if you do, no one will ever ask you to arrange again!  For RANGE a cappella, I'd definitely say that the sound is great! You all really work well together. I just hate that this song is still a big one for groups. Even in college groups. Pitch Slapped did this as part of their ICCA set, and I didn't even like the a cappella version then!   Still, your group sounds fantastic, and I understand how tough it is to arrange this song, so good job on that too!"

I bet you'd like Pust (particularly the first few tracks on Femkant).

acappella,2jfvx6,jaredtheG,6,Thu Oct 16 18:32:34 2014 UTC,"Been a while since I have done one, but when I was learning how to do it in college I would take a stepwise approach:   Identify the individual chunks of the song (intro, verse, chorus, bridge, and outro for the most part).  Figure out the order there chunks go (intro,  verse 1, chorus, verse 2, bridge, chorus, verse 3, outro).  Take a sheet of composition paper for each section and write the chords above the staffs, making sure line up with the actual count of the song.  Write down the notes in each cord in the blank measures.  Write voice parts that try to hit one of the chord's notes one in a row, be creative with rhythm and words here.  Repeat for each section.  Stitch each section together into an entire song.    This stepwise approach was nice because it was like a big math problem. As you get used to it, you'll explore new and different ways to structure chords and melodies. Exploring 6ths, major and minor 7th, and 9ths adds some color.   My $0.02."
acappella,2jfvx6,implante,3,Thu Oct 16 19:22:28 2014 UTC,"I don't think I'm going to give you specific instruction in this regard, as there are many ways to go about arranging, but I'll give you some general advice that I learned over the years.  Listen to a lot of acapella on youtube etc. and pay attention to the structure of the arrangements. This helps you find the styles you like and can give you ideas for innovating on other songs that you want to arrange. Before arranging a specific song, you can search to see if there are previously existing acapella covers (or actually just covers in general) that you can take inspiration from when you then go on to make your original arrangement.  You have to remember that you're not trying to 'translate' the song you want to cover into acapella. You're actually just taking the melody from the original and writing a new song to fit it. Many beginners make the mistake of thinking they need to directly transcribe parts of the song that aren't the melody. ""Well this guitar riff is super cool... so, I'll have the sopranos sing that in the chorus."" Actually, this is a great way to make a bad acappella song, because try as we might there is no way to improve on the original while leaving the parts intact if we just replace the parts with voices. My advice: listen to a song until you know it so well that you can sing the whole thing without thinking about it. Leave it on loop while you're studying. Then, after noting the key and possibly transcribing the melody, write your arrangement based on the feel of the song that you remember, without actually going back to listen to the song. Trust me - if you go back and find out that you totally forgot to include that one guitar riff that is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY to the song, leave it out. If you didn't remember it, it is not a part of the vital essence of the song.  On the topic of imitating instruments with your voice, I am strongly of the opinion that it is very hard to pull off without the benefit of studio production. Instead, focus on the advantages that the voice has over instruments. First, chords are SOOOO much more rich when sung than when played on a guitar (for the most part). Take advantage of that. Arrange so that your voices are close together and play directly off each other in interesting ways. Full chords are your best weapons. Doubling octaves is a luxury of large groups that can spare voices away from filling out the chord, so avoid lazy octaves unless you're using the sound for a purpose. Second, voices have inherent, communicative emotion that instruments do not. Hear a simple major chord in your head (eg. C E G). Hold it there for a second. Now hear it being sung on the syllable ""ooh"". Bring that ""ooh"" slowly to an ""OH"". Don't they feel different? Don't they mean different things? ""WOAH-ooh, WOAH-ooh"" tells a story. ""hmmmAAAHHHHHHHmmmmmhh"" tells a different one. Your syllables should work alongside your voices to tell the story of the song as it progresses, and can make a dramatic difference in the feel.  For a contemporary or jazz group, a pretty simple way to go about arrangement construction is to think about the number of rhythms you have going on at one time. For any group that hasn't absolutely perfected vowel formation and blend, it's generally easier to have fewer rhythms going at once. What does this mean? There will always be the melody, sung by the soloist. Then there is the bassline, which generally follows its own rhythm line. Most groups nowadays have a percussionist, adding a third rhythm. Finally there are the upper voices (either tenor, alto, soprano; bari, T2, T1; or alto 1, mezzo, soprano - depending on your group formation). These can be used to create separate rhythm lines or they share a rhythm that sometimes joins in with or compliments the melody or bassline. It's often simplest to do the latter, as the more rhythms there are going on at one time, the more potential there is for the arrangement to sound muddy - again - if the blend isn't excellent. There are ways to make a rhythmically complicated arrangement blend into the other parts in such a way - with different voices joining and separating as the lines progress - but that is quite a difficult arranging style for a beginner. My recommendation? Four rhythms: Melody, Bass, Beatbox, Upper Voices.  Phew that was long. Good luck!"
acappella,2jfvx6,NotAD0ll,3,Thu Oct 16 23:58:46 2014 UTC,"For Mash-ups: what I typically like to do is to first find songs with similar chord progressions and themes/emotion to put together. Typically I will have one song in mind and then look for another. Once I have found songs that pair well together, I identify what are my favorite parts of each song and which melodies sound cool together.  A really excellent example of mashed songs with similar themes: Sweet Dreams / Seven Nation Army  This mash-up example weaves the melodies together in a really cool way. Keeping background parts fairly repetitive also is a good idea when connecting two different songs. I have found it keeps things less confusing.  For Medleys: I would say I have less experience with these. Often the most difficult part of medleys to arrange is the transitions. For these, I would say the same thing as in mash-ups: keeping background parts uncomplicated and neat/clean during transitions would be a good idea. Finding a good flow between the songs is key to not having awkward moments in your arrangement. For example, in a Lady Gaga mash-up, something like ""Eh Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)"" would be a good transition/middle song while a high-powered song like ""Edge of Glory"" would probably come last/close to last. Starting more mellow and building up energy is always a good technique.   Hope that helps! This is just how I think when I'm arranging. Good luck!"
acappella,2jfvx6,edward_would,2,Fri Oct 17 00:06:25 2014 UTC,"If you want a solid arrangement of a song the most important thing to get right is the bassline. So many bad arrangement just have plodding, root-note crotchets in the bass part. THE KEY to the arrangement's mood is the bassline; if it's energetic, even if all the other parts are static, the piece will flow along. FOCUS ON YOUR BASSLINE - it's a second melody. After that, the BGs are decoration."
acappella,2jfvx6,edward_would,1 point,Fri Oct 17 14:49:08 2014 UTC,"And if you're looking for inspiration, get some good headphones/speakers, listen to some Naturally 7 or Straight No Chaser and think about what the bass is doing and how that's affecting the piece."
acappella,2jfvx6,blay12,2,Fri Oct 17 14:49:52 2014 UTC,"A few other comments have said similar things to what I'm about to say, but for mashups, medleys, and arrangements in general, the key is to really know 2 things - the songs you're arranging and the group you're arranging them for.   Concerning the songs you want to arrange, /u/Doubieboobiez said it very well. Know the songs well enough that you can remember every ""important"" part, or at least well enough to be able to sing the solo and hear the rest of the song in your mind. That gives you the freedom to work within the structure the song already set, and try out some original ideas. Maybe you want to completely restructure the song around just the solo (which you now know by heart), or around the guitar part you love (which you also know by heart). Knowing the song(s) inside and out is half of the battle.   The next part is going to come down to the group that you're arranging for. Are you arranging a song for the group you sing with? FANTASTIC! That means that you really know everyone's voices and what they can do with them. Do you have 4 fantastic soloists but are arranging a 1 solo song with no harmony parts? Now you can arrange all of your background parts and add in a crazy trio part that no one else would be able to sing!   When it comes to the parts that you write, I'd definitely listen to a lot of a cappella and internalize what is being done. Nowadays the presiding arrangement theme (and I don't disagree with it) going on in larger group a cappella is to have the bass and VP running nearly identical to the song you're arranging, and then just write completely new material for all of the other parts, mainly strong sustained notes, occasionally echoing solo phrases and doing fun choral exercises (who doesn't love a great arpeggio or slide up to an unexpected chord, right?).   For medleys in particular, don't try to force anything (unless you have a great way to fit one songs melody over top of another's chord structure). Some songs are written with similar tempos and chord progressions, and those are the best ones to focus on if you're just starting out (look at FOB's ""My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark"" compared to pretty much every other pop song at the time, including Radioactive, Trouble, and Miss Jackson (the Panic! one, not the Outkast one)).   TL;DR - Basically, just do a lot of critical listening. Figure out what you want your sound to be, and then follow that path. Medley wise, find songs with similar keys and bpm, and just go ham on them. Overall, just arrange so that your group can sing whatever you're writing!"

Something I've started doing this semester is to begin practice by playing an a cappella song as the last couple people come in to get people excited (and to hold their attention.) We practice in a classroom that has a projector hooked up to the computer so it gives them something to look at too.  I won't walk through a whole practice because I'm sure you know better than I do what works, especially for your own group; however what I've found that helps is giving people breaks but also holding their attention at the same time. I do this in 2 main ways:  (1) During active learning time, I try to work with smaller groups individually and let everyone else do their own thing, but encourage them to listen and follow along on their part. Almost always after working with one section on something, I'll add in related sections (or just everyone) afterwards, first to show the section in question what it sounds like in context, but also to get everyone's attention again so we can move forward.  (2) During breaks (1-2 ten-ish minute breaks in the middle of our 2-hour practice), I'll usually find some video to show for whoever wants to watch it (others can talk), and then bring us back from the break with some matter of business we need to discuss--this is a smoother transition for people who were off in their own conversations and keeps me from basically having to say ""shut up and let's sing"".  It is really frustrating for practices to be inefficient and to not have people's attention. If it gets bad, you may just want to sit the group down and talk to them about those things. Together, brainstorm some concrete ways you can all work toward making practice more efficient: minimizing phone use (and limiting it to breaks only), following along on parts when someone else is working with you, etc.  But it's not all fire and brimstone! Sometimes lots of talking is just an indicator that the people in your group really like each other. It's always important for you guys to hang out with each other outside of practice time; it makes for stronger bonds, better group dynamic, and makes your practices better. Have dinner at someone's apartment. Go to a (small) concert. If all your interactions are limited to practice time, people try to fit it all in; if you see each other outside of practice time, it helps separate work and play.   Finally, there's only so much you can do. People are gonna talk and practices aren't gonna go exactly like you want them all the time, and that's okay. Just remind people every now and then that you're there to make great music together in community and that doesn't happen by magic--it takes serious and hard work. Best of luck with future practices! Keep on keeping on, being music director is hard work but it's so rewarding!"

All the guys are really good friends but it's difficult to switch between hanging around and getting serious and learnings music. I've done my best, but sometimes have to turn our to be the bad guy and come off kind of aggressive. I'm just wondering the best way to set order and remain professional through the whole thing."
acappella,2ipoyg,blay12,1 point,Thu Oct 9 03:00:47 2014 UTC,"Ok so first of all, sorry for responding so late to this post! I jump in here every once in a while, but it looks like I missed your thread my last time through!   Second of all, this is a novel of a post, so try to stick with it!  I was the MD of an all male group for 3 of my 4 years in school, and have been MD for other groups/musical productions/operas and all other sorts of things since graduating 2 years ago. The issues you're describing are pretty typical to every rehearsal that's ever existed, and there are a few ways to get past them.   First, have a plan for your rehearsal. Know what you want to work on and how long you want to spend on it. When I joined my group, the music director at the time was notorious for starting us off on something, getting sidetracked, and having the whole rehearsal fall into chaos. If you have a goal in mind when it comes to what you want to accomplish (learning notes on a new song, finally locking down dynamics, nailing new choreo, etc) for each song in your set, you can hold everyone to that schedule. Have breaks, but limit them to a certain amount of time, and know where you're going with the rehearsal once you end a break (the death of any rehearsal is a break that never ends...all of a sudden you've got 15 guys watching 8 different youtube videos and you can never regain control). Have a new song ready to go at the end of your 5-10 minute chill sesh.   So when I say ""have a new song ready to go"", it's to emphasize the next point I'm going to lay on you. Don't harp forever on the same thing. A professor of mine liked to say that he ""changed speeds"" (a baseball reference, initially), and that was how he kept the class moving forward. I've been in choirs and orchestras with some of ""the best"" choir and band/orch directors in the world, and they all shared something in common - speed and intensity, sprinkled with a little bit of excitement! When we'd hit a rough part of the score, they'd know immediately which part/section was having the trouble (because they knew the score). They'd stop everybody mid-piece, and say ""Flutes, play starting at rehearsal D, everyone else, take a break and check your scores"". The flutes would play their part, and the conductor would tweak the way they played it, as well as gently finding out who was having the most issues with the section and correcting that too. The conductor would give the entire section the advice that the weakest member needed, and then hit the one section of the piece around 5-10 times, giving slight critiques and insight each time. Then, he'd bring in the rest of the ensemble, and all of a sudden, all of the little issues that may have been happening in every part were fixed, and the section sounded a million times better.   When people see that the one section that is making the worst errors gets extra attention and is made to play/sing the same thing over and over again until it's perfect, the other sections are going to up their game. They're going to say to themselves ""Cmon guys, we're gonna nail our section too, otherwise we're gonna have to sing that other 5 bar part over and over again in front of everyone."" It'll incentivize everyone to work just a little bit harder to avoid being called out in front of the rest of the group. Sure, the MD isn't criticizing the sections he's working with, but the fact that he's  stopped rehearsal to work with only them is enough to make other sections want to avoid it.   With that in mind, don't overdo your attention on one section. Change Speeds. Work with one section that really has a problem for 5-10 mins, then run that section with everyone, and then start a new song. No one wants to sing the same song 30 times in an hour, and everyone starts to feel fatigued when one part or another just can't seem to get their notes. Touch on it, work it out as best you can, and then MOVE ON. I generally tried to only work a single song for 20-30 mins max, and then move on.   While you're working on each song, just make sure that you're constantly keeping things interesting to keep the entire group on their toes. If you work with one section for the entire 20 minute block, you turn around and the entire room is now texting/talking/doing homework/wasting time on reddit, and it takes you another 10 minutes to get everyone back in the zone. Hit on the trouble spots quick, and then get off of them. Don't be afraid to stop in the middle of a song, or restart a section that you just restarted. Do what you have to do as soon as you hear an issue.   All of that rehearsal etiquette stuff being said, don't devalue the benefits of a good ""do nothing"" practice. You're dragging your group out to rehearsals multiple times a week, and they're going to get tired of it eventually. Even the best groups do. Remember, you're basically living with these guys for a minimum of 6-12 hours a week, depending on your rehearsal/performance schedule, and excluding your party schedule. You need to be able to get along, and not wind them up so much that no one can enjoy the company of their group members.   When I talk to my friends who were in my group while I was MD, the times we reminisce about the most were those lazy Sunday practices where we tried to get something done, but I slacked on running things and just let everyone watch YouTube videos for 2 hours. We talk about the times I let everyone ditch practice early so we could get to the karaoke night in time to sign up for 10-15 songs. Even though we had great rehearsals, those times all stood out because those were the times we were able to bond as a group, and those were the times that made us awesome friends.   So here's a TL;DR for you - Keep practices moving, know what you need to get done, and always be pushing forward. All that aside, make sure to let the group have a blah rehearsal every once in a while, because it'll knit you all together and end up making your performances even better!"

If it makes you feel any better, I didn't just universally apply it to all the tracks and in fact spent a lot of time making it less and less obvious because I kept worrying that people would, well, dislike it (clearly not enough). The goal wasn't to show people ""how cool my throwback style"" is, but really just to create a (possibly unnecessary) distinction between the feel of the sections.   That being said, we're working on a lot more stuff and I can assure you that none of it has any old-timey sounding effects. Hope you'll enjoy those more!"

Are you allowed to play an instrument, or is it truly an a cappella contest? How are ""votes"" even awarded (panel of judges, every audience member, internet voters, etc)?   Voicewise, you're very good. You know how to move around, and you don't drop pitch while you do it (which a lot of people seem to have trouble with). I think you'd probably do well in a pop vocal competition, but I'm just not sure this is the right place for advice (unless you're trying to be the first solo act on The Sing Off!)."

acappella,2hstiu,blay12,1 point,Thu Oct 2 05:58:54 2014 UTC,"Luckily for you, Seven Lions mainly sticks to solid melodic EDM, and the fact that it's mashed up with F+tM (which is almost always perfect to arrange) just makes it even better.   Instead of trying to be true to the Seven Lions remix, I'd recommend you stick closer to the Florence + the Machine original as your base, mixing in portions of the 7L backgrounds to give a new take on the original instrumental. While I do like the 7L mix of this song, I really feel like they overpower the only true moments of contrast by trying to include a continuous bass line (best example is at ""the stars, the moon etc..., where normally you'd get the 3 quick hits and then all of a sudden have silence). The best part of any arrangement is contrasting textures, and nothing contrasts in music like moments of silence.   Getting back to your original questions though, the only solid recording of and EDM artist I can think of is Exit 245's recording of Cinema (the skrillex remix of the benny benassi song). Their version is probably the best ""a cappella treatment"" of a brostep style dubstep piece. They arranged the heck out of it, and combined their arrangement with some stellar mixing from James Gammon. It's kind of a halfway point between a complete emulation of the original and a totally new arrangement that just uses the song as ""inspiration"".  Check it out here if you haven't heard it."

acappella,2heksp,unitire,8,Thu Sep 25 05:18:15 2014 UTC,"It sounds like you may not be ready to do this one yet, If this would be your first time, I'd try to do something simpler just so you get an idea of how it all works. Or you might find working with someone else in your group with more experience helpful.   If you do tackle it, think out a gameplan of the song form (Verse, Chorus, etc). Include which song your taking each element from. You may want to write out themes and motifs from each song in case you can use them somewhere. If you're looking to layer melodies over each other, check where the chord progression of one song could support the melody of the other, they don't have to be exactly matching.  By the looks of the keys, you'll want to match them as best you can. If the Eb minor song is truly aeolian (normal minor: 1 2 3b 4 5 6b 7b), then you'll want to either raise the key of the first song from F to Gb OR lower the key second song from Eb minor to D minor. That way they are relative major/minor of each other.  Arranging can sometimes be as easy as writing what you hear in your head when you imagine voices replacing instruments or doing something different. You hear it, you write it.  Other than that, make sure you know the ranges of your group members (if your bass doesn't have a low D, don't write it). And when it's convenient,  having good voice leading makes it easier for the singers to learn and perform correctly.   Good luck! If you want some more advice, PM me and I'll get back when I can."
acappella,2heksp,italian6th,5,Thu Sep 25 06:52:11 2014 UTC,"/u/italian6th is spot on. While it's awesome that you want to try your hand at arranging - don't make it too difficult on you right at the start. In general I finish about one arrangement out of every ten I start... It's okay to fail. It's okay to not be insanely clever with everything. It's okay to repeat yourself. Go and have some fun! I'd also recommend picking up A Cappella Arranging by Deke Sharon  and Dylan Bell, it's really good reading especially if you just started."
acappella,2heksp,drehz,2,Thu Sep 25 11:25:48 2014 UTC,"I'm a little late to this, but I'd love to throw in a little bit of advice.   Firstly, I agree with what the other 2 guys said. This is an ambitious first arrangement for someone who has never arranged before. Ambitiousness aside, can you give me a little more info? ""Similar themes and phrases"" could mean a lot of things. Does themes mean thematic musical elements (one melody associated with the song or a particular feeling in the song repeated a few times) or thematic lyrical elements (both songs lyrics have a theme of ""being happy with your girl"" or something like that)? Does similar phrases mean that song A has three 4 bar phrases followed by 1 quick 2 bar phrase, or does it mean that each song has similar lyrics (linguistic phrases)?  Without those questions answered, I can't really be sure I'm telling you the right thing, but I'll try to give you some quick advice on mashups.   Let's look at the time signatures first. You have one song in 4/4 and another in 12/8. If there were ever 2 perfect time signatures to match up to each other, it would be these two. 12/8 is 4/4, we're just changing how we count the time (duple vs triple). You can keep the exact same 4 count beat between the two and still have worlds of contrast when you switch between them or combine them together! When it comes to arranging, that sort of rhythmic variation is perfect for bringing something different to a track.  Key-wise, the songs are quite close (Eb minor's relative major is Gb major, which is only a half step above the other song's key of F major). If you bring the entire Eb minor song down by a half step, both songs are now technically in the same key!   Now that we've figured out how these songs can fit together harmonically and tempo-wise, you're going to have to actually arrange them. Some people write a song that they call a ""mashup"" by arranging half of one song and then half of the other song, and then perform it by just singing one half followed by the other. In my opinion, that's not a mashup, it's a crappy 2 song medley.   If you really want to write a mashup, figure out which melody lines from each song fit over the chord progressions of the other song. For example, lines from Zedd's ""Clarity"" fit in very well with the progressions in Avicii's ""Wake Me Up"". The chorus of FOB's ""My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark"" fits perfectly with Imagine Dragon's ""Radioctive"" (the rest of the song does too, btw...plus with TSwift's ""trouble""...and like 10 other songs...that song is begging for a mashup).   Anyways, once you've figured out which lines go where, start writing your backgrounds around that. Use contrasting musical elements from each song against each other to really bring out the fact that you're not shoving 2 songs together, you're actually integrating them (with a song in 12/8 and a song in 4/4, this gets super easy, because they differ greatly in a way that is still easy to push together!).   For Solos, I'd generally have 2 soloists. The first verse and chorus come from song A, but during the Song A chorus, the Song B soloist begins to come in with Song B's chorus (which I would hope matches up at least a little with Song A's chorus). After that, the arrangement shifts to Song B for the next verse/chorus (with Song A soloist coming in for part of the Song B chorus to remind us how clever your arrangement is and that it's actually 2 songs in one). From there on out, you throw elements of both songs together in the backgrounds and the solos, and can have dueling solos for a solid effect.   And that pretty much covers it (at least, it covers the basic thoughts I had while I was writing it, plus what anyone can do to pop out a quick mashup!). If you want some good examples of how to combine different solo elements with backgrounds from another song that kind of fits, I'd say check out the Nor'Easter's most recent CD ""Equilibrium"", bc they do a good job of putting stuff together on a few tracks (I'd say on Spectrum, Diamonds, and Don't You Worry Child especially)."
acappella,2hd366,vivialyn14,13,Wed Sep 24 20:17:20 2014 UTC,"I'll start by saying I don't think I can necessarily give you a song that'll work for you straight away, but I'll try to come up with some general points.  1. Choose a song you know  The most important thing is that you're familiar with your audition song. You could learn a great song and you'd probably be able to sing the notes, but it takes a long time to truly know the climbs and falls, the arc and the subtle little details of a song you've heard a hundred times. When performing a solo, you want to express yourself and tell a story - this is a lot easier if you're already familiar.   2. Choose an interesting song  This was already touched upon, but I'll mention it anyway. You don't want a song that just repeats the same melody every line four times throughout the verse - it's possible to make it work, but you have to work a lot harder. Instead, let the melody of the song work for you - if part of the storytelling is done by the song itself, you'll have to work less hard.   3. Don't restrict yourself to your voice part  You say you're a mezzo. Does that mean you can't sing a sop solo, or a tenor solo for that matter? Of course not. You're singing unaccompanied, so you can just shift the key of any song up and down until it fits nicely into your range. There will still be songs that remain awkward to you no matter where you start, but for the most part if you have a decent range you'll be able to sing any solo.  4. Make the song suit you  This ties in with the last point - make sure the song showcases you well. If you think your low range is your strong suit, put the song in a key that makes you stay in that range most of the time. If you think you're good in both low and high registers, choose a range that'll let you dip into both to show off your versatility. If there's an area where you get insecure in the song, or you can't reach it comfortably in your preferred key - drop it, or change it. People won't care, and it's better to know your limits than try and fail to impress with the bit you can't do.   5. Know your song  Tying in with the first point to bring it full circle - try to bring something new to your performance. Even if you know the song very well - pull up the lyrics, get out pen and paper and write them down line by line. Read them, interpret them, connect with them. Dive into them, make them mean something to you. Try to look at the song as if you'd never seen it before, and find the most important aspect to you. Let that speak when you sing. If you tell that story properly, your performance will be great. Semi-related, know your audience - if you know you're auditioning for a group that is known to have a jazzy style, choose your song accordingly. You wouldn't audition for a rock group with a folk song; it's probably not showing off the talents they're looking for. Never forget to stay true to your strengths though! If you have a musical theatre voice, don't force it into a rock solo. It won't work.   I'm sorry if my advice is slightly long-winded, and overlapping in parts - I just wrote down parts of my thoughts on auditions that I've had over the years of auditioning people. Generally, if you put some thought into which one of your favourite songs you pick and practice a bit beforehand, you'll probably be fine - the connection between singer and song remains the most captivating part of a performance to me, and it is very audible. When I'm auditioning people, I'm looking for people to bring something that we don't have in the group yet - so be yourself. It's what you're best at, and if they need what you are then you will be taken.   Finally, in case you can't get anything out of the above, I suppose I'll give some straight song suggestions a shot. You need to sing a minute, so a verse and chorus will do just fine. If there are lengthy instrumentals, practice singing while skipping them (and without accompaniment). Hold the attention of the people in the room, and be confident. You say you're an alto, but you didn't mention what type of alto you are... broadly speaking, I'd differentiate between the ""rock alto"" with a powerful belt and a lot of ring to their voice, and the more smokey ""jazz alto"". If you feel closer to the Rock alto - my group has a song called Bang on this piano which I think works really well as a rock alto solo. Alternatively, I've heard jazz altos do a lot of Nat King Cole (specifically one performance of L.O.V.E. will always be burnt into my memory), so look into him. If you're more of a diva, Somebody to love by Queen would work pretty well I guess (start from ""Each morning I get up..."" straight away). Domino by Jessie J is in the same vein - more of a sop solo, but it's great if you really want to show off your vocal colour. Generally anything by Sara Bareilles would work well in an audition as well - make sure to listen to her live recordings for the little details. I choose you is one I really like. Don't be afraid to choose something a bit more obscure... Chances are they've heard Problem or Royals a hundred times already, so they'll welcome a song they haven't heard before!  I hope I could help you a bit and didn't completely overload you with advice... feel free to PM as well if you've got any more question, or think I didn't cover something I should've :)"
acappella,2hd366,drehz,2,Wed Sep 24 21:49:24 2014 UTC,"Just wanted to mention that was super helpful.

The Parting Glass I also like, but one of the basses we ended up taking auditioned with love lockdown. For something a bit more groovy, maybe Charlie Winston's Like a Hobo?   Again, and most importantly for baritones maybe - change keys to suit yourself, and cut bits you can't do. If I know the song and I notice you've been creative with it to make it fit your voice, that alone will probably earn you a few extra points!"

acappella,2h8zux,gosp,2,Wed Sep 24 00:23:19 2014 UTC,"This has none of the pent-up energy of the original. It barely builds. Like at 2:15 they have the exact same parts that had at the beginning, whereas the original at the same point in the song has the same two lines, another texture mallet sound, a big swelling sound every few beats, and a pad going on in the background. The result of this is that the guitar solo sounds awkward and out of place.   3:45 is great but the journey there got so boring."

acappella,2h8dyt,cyberforte,1 point,Tue Sep 23 21:45:07 2014 UTC,Really? Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 are a lot more basic compared to this album. I'm glad to see Pentatonix change things up and stay away from your typical pop progression. The beginning of Papaoutai specifically is just a great example of how great a cappella music can be.
acappella,2h8dyt,Skyrider50,2,Thu Sep 25 03:26:00 2014 UTC,"I think Vol 1 was actually some of their best. Take another listen to ""Baddest Girl"", ""Somebody That I Used to Know"", ""Aha!"", and ""Show You How to Love"". I feel like the originality in those really pushed what people thought of a cappella, and transported me to new worlds.  Vol 3 was quite well arranged, but nothing stood out to me, and I felt it lacked heart. Vol 3 didn't take me anywhere. Papaoutai's intro is nice, but seems to be pretty much the standard classical SATB choir fare (except the slide is cool)."

acappella,2hb4in,wolflink009,5,Wed Sep 24 06:50:52 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't say its ""truly terrible"" as /u/FoxyGramps did, but I do think there are two areas you can work on that would quickly improve the group. Those areas are pitch and blend. Pitch is probably the most important thing to fix, but both problem areas can all be fixed with listening. Listening to each other will really vastly help here. The high tenor really sticks out and he and the bass are not in tune.   The fixes here come down to paying attention to each other and practice. It sounds like a group of strong singers, so I think you have the parts, its the execution that needs work. Good luck!"

In my group, we've actually been split between people who really want to do the four chord song and people who are staunchly against it.  I personally believe as an arranger that a lot of the fun of a cappella is performing unique arrangements that show of the group's personality (or at least the arranger's personality...).  If we ""texture"" each individual solo, there would be a ton of stuff to learn for a concert coming up in a month that we still have other stuff to learn for, and if we keep it super simple, it gets incredibly boring.  I really like the original performance of the song, though.  They actually came out with an updated version, too, I believe!"

acappella,2gs0xl,jeeco,0,Thu Sep 18 22:57:30 2014 UTC,"I kind of found this cover to be really lackluster, personally. I usually enjoy their arrangements, but this one feel pretty flat with me. There's nothing in this version that really wowed me as much as the original did back when I first heard it.   I understand that they're just five vocalists/cellist with a violinist but this just felt very plain. I really enjoyed their Daft Punk medley because of the different and interesting choices they made for the song, but there was nothing interesting or exciting about this one, which is a shame because it's a great song."
acappella,2gpdpe,Renix,3,Wed Sep 17 22:31:08 2014 UTC,"My opinion: this was boring. I don't think Pentatonix did a bad job with it, I just think the song itself is really boring."
acappella,2gpdpe,cyberforte,2,Thu Sep 18 01:46:23 2014 UTC,"Pentatonix has done some great things with extremely boring songs in the past. One of my favorite examples of this is I Need Your Love. The original isn't BAD per se, just not a lot going on musically, but their cover had a lot of cool parts."

acappella,2g0m28,TheAlmightyFUPA,1 point,Wed Sep 10 17:14:54 2014 UTC,"Here's how I do it (seems similar to his technique): you bring your teeth together and open the lips up to concentrate the sound. Then you hum, and it works in the same way a kazoo does. The sound vibrates your teeth together as you hum. Look up the PETEbox cover of ""Kids"". You'll get a better visual of it there."

acappella,2fy9sp,nathandavid13,2,Wed Sep 10 04:46:19 2014 UTC,They're allowing the use of instruments and backing tracks this season. Source: their website.
acappella,2fy9sp,drque,1 point,Wed Sep 10 08:31:36 2014 UTC,"According to Deke, the focus is still on vocal harmonies.  Now choirs backed by a piano and groups that use effects pedals can compete, too.  Not sure if I like the idea yet, but hopefully it'll drive better ratings than season 4."
acappella,2fy9sp,craigatron,3,Wed Sep 10 12:12:39 2014 UTC,So basically they changed the rules to let Sonos/Arora compete?
acappella,2fy9sp,tehm,1 point,Wed Sep 10 14:49:27 2014 UTC,"Had they had there pedals, I still don't think they would have won. Assuming they've been hard at work, they may be able to handle the show."
acappella,2fy9sp,Zashiony,1 point,Wed Sep 10 21:27:12 2014 UTC,Well yeah but that's only because they were on the same season as Pentatonix.  I think with pedals they could have easily taken either season 1 or 4.
acappella,2fy9sp,tehm,1 point,Wed Sep 10 23:51:33 2014 UTC,Maybe they'll revert to the old format if the fan base grows and ratings rise?
acappella,2fy9sp,Zashiony,1 point,Wed Sep 10 21:28:38 2014 UTC,"That would be nice, but I kind of doubt it.  I suspect that this season is a test to see if TSO can survive with a new format since last season didn't do particularly well.  If this one doesn't get good ratings I bet we won't see a TSO 6, and if it does then I think we're stuck with this format."
acappella,2fy9sp,craigatron,1 point,Thu Sep 11 13:36:19 2014 UTC,"They're allowing instruments and background tracks, but they are by no means required.   The show will still be about vocal harmony and group performance, so A Cappella will still be the focus as far as I can tell.

acappella,2fxo08,acappelican,1 point,Wed Sep 10 03:55:40 2014 UTC,That was incredible.  How does the guy make the distorted guitar sound with his voice? I've been trying for a while now but I can't for the life of me ever seem to figure it out.
acappella,2fxo08,torma616,1 point,Wed Sep 10 16:12:15 2014 UTC,"This guitar sound is just a voice running through distortion - he's not actually making the sound, just adjusting the formant of his voice a bit to affect the guitar tone.  Typically, vocal distorted guitar noises are made by  pursing your lips and resting your front two teeth on top of your bottom lip (imagine you're trying to impersonate a beaver or a rabbit). Then, you essentially sing an ""eee"" vowel through your teeth and the space between your lip and front teeth will buzz. Works better in high falsetto!! More saliva = more distortion. Hope that helps!"

acappella,2fzzgy,torma616,2,Thu Sep 11 07:45:12 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I totally get why you asked here, but /r/acappella is more about the a cappella genre of music (made famous by bands such as Boyz II Men, Pentatonix, Naturally 7, VocaPeople, Rockapella, etc.). I get you're looking for clips of rappers saying certain catchphrases without background music (and thus the ""a cappella"" records of those phrases), but this community isn't really geared in that direction.   Here, we're not interested/focused on getting isolated vocal tracks like that and mixing them, but more the live creation of songs using only voices!"

acappella,2fyqus,AnOnlyMoose,3,Wed Sep 10 01:30:47 2014 UTC,At my school the policy is that all the groups must release their decisions during the same time window (e.g. between 9pm and 11pm on the last day of audition weekend) and prospectives must wait until the end of that window to accept or reject offers. This way everyone hears back from every group before they decide. Maybe talk to whoever's in charge of arts to suggest implementing something similar?

I've seen collegiate groups charge anywhere from $50 to upwards of $2500 for 30 minutes of music. It all depends on what the client is willing to pay, what your group's value is, and how well you can sell your services. Mark Hines of The Vocal Company is an absolute wizard when it comes to this stuff; in fact, his Serious Business workshop is largely built around helping groups solve this problem. I'd highly recommend reaching out to him (I'm sure he'd be happy to talk with you) and getting his insight!"

It's easy for someone to sit back and label them as smug, but I know first-hand that they pour every fiber of their being into their creations.  Try seeing their extra-expressiveness as their genuine attempt to engage and encourage new musicians so that they may carry the torch of a acappella to the next lucky group that lands a national brand."

Just because it has the word a cappella in it does not mean it is anything close to an a cappella group, in that context it just means that some of the pieces will not be accompanied."

I think it should be fine to promote your music (I mean, I feel like over half of the stuff is people posting youtube videos of their own group...), and even asking people to buy your album is fine, but asking people to fund a future album might be too far.  I know I'd love it if we got more funding for our next album which is going to be released in the fall of 2015, but I don't think this is the right place to ask for funding.

acappella,2dijdl,Renix,4,Thu Aug 14 13:17:24 2014 UTC,This should be removed. It's not a cappella. Simple as that. That's the reason it hasn't been posted.
acappella,2dijdl,Nolongerlurkin,-3,Thu Aug 14 06:31:08 2014 UTC,"I disagree obv.   What doesn't belong here: things that aren't related to a cappella.   This is clearly related to a cappella since it's the world's most famous a cappella group's members singing together almost entirely unaccompanied.  And again, there is 100x less instrumentation in this than there is an overproduced studio track, or multi-track voice recording.  A pluck or two on the piano here and there doesn't change the nature of it.  If you stripped the piano from this recording it'd be just as good.   Listen to :55 to 1:20, completely unaccompanied, as an example."
acappella,2dijdl,Nolongerlurkin,2,Thu Aug 14 17:41:35 2014 UTC,"So I should be able to submit this to this subreddit? It the most basic guitar accompaniment. Way more simple than the work the producer does in the studio for a cappella recordings. It has two of the most famous a cappella singers in the video. If you took the guitar away it would still sound GREAT!  See my point? No mater how minimal the accompaniment, it's either a cappella or not. The ""related to"" in the sidebar leaves open room to link articles and discussions related to a cappella. That phrasing isn't there so you can post Super Fruit videos."

I think my problem honestly is with Scott and Kirstie. Scott does a great job singing the lead here as usual, but I would have loved if Kirstie could have taken it on. Having a strong high belt from a female voice on that chorus is what makes it for me. Scott flips up into the high note really lightly and it sound nice but it doesn't bring the impact that I think it could. I'm not trying to diss Kirstie but If someone like Rozzie Crane was in the group, there would be more diversity in the sound with having a female handle the big female leads."
acappella,2dcbqo,Nolongerlurkin,5,Tue Aug 12 18:02:04 2014 UTC,I love PTX but to me this cover had too much make it your own-ness. I wish it sounded a bit more like the original. To me it sounds very different. They performed beautifully as they always do but it was just missing something.

acappella,2dcbqo,webaddictress,1 point,Wed Aug 13 12:19:08 2014 UTC,"To me, part of what defines a professional group (as opposed to college, semi-pro, etc) is an appreciable amount of original material (and yes, I know that the technical definition is 'making your living doing it'). PTX have so far and continue to rely heavily on covered material - there probably are collegiate groups out there with more original songs than them. I felt they were taking a step into the right direction with Vol. 2, both in that regard and in terms of variety of arrangements (which they didn't really have at all before that album... Horribly predictable). However I'm having a hunch they're taking a step backwards with this album... Objectively though, the cover is alright (although not the most inspired song choice) and the album probably will be as well.  (Rant over ;-) )"
acappella,2dcbqo,VanSensei,5,Wed Aug 13 16:41:29 2014 UTC,"I have a sneaking suspicion that PTX Vol III will be much the same as vol 2, only with better studio equipment, and that they're working on a full-length original album for the future. RCA might be pitching them songs from the file cabinets and pairing them with writers while PTX is writing their own... that takes lots of time. They need new material to tour on considering they've done like three US tours with the same material. They probably also could use the money/exposure and another EP will buy them time. If any of that is true, I'm on board."

acappella,2daald,not2sharpmd,2,Tue Aug 12 01:09:11 2014 UTC,"I've attended several Next Level sessions since their inception, and I can honestly say they've changed my life. The instructors are top notch (especially Shams and Ben, the two teaching this arranging seminar; they're both insanely talented and great guys to learn from), the environment is absolutely inspiring, and the Next Level alumni community is incredible.  Since my career as a producer and mix engineer was launched after attending my first Next Level, I have had the good fortune to regularly collaborate with several of my fellow Next Levelers and frequently receive valuable feedback from them on works in progress, so the bonds you develop last far beyond the seminar itself.  If it seems like I am just a shill for Next Level, take a look at the results that the program has produced and the names that have come through Next Level. The tracks created during the seminars have received multiple awards and placements on compilation albums, and many of its alumni have gone on to win big at ICCAs, the CARAs, and elsewhere.  Beyond all of that, though, it's just a blast and a truly life-changing experience. I assure you that it's worth it, and I hope that you decide to join the Next Level family!"
acappella,2daald,waitingforjune,1 point,Tue Aug 12 01:19:49 2014 UTC,I attended Next Level Arranging with Rob Dietz and I can honestly say it was one of my favorite lifetime experiences. The people are so warm and welcoming and passionate about giving everybody the tools for success. The first night there people were literally tracking their own material at 4 in the morning and listened to freshly finished EPs. The collaborative arranging was an incredible experience that changed how I approach every arrangement I do. They even stopped early and threw me a 21st birthday party. If you want a life changing experience You know where to go.

My suggestion: keep a list of people who respond so that even if you don't get enough interest now, you can continue to build it until you have enough people to get started.  It helps a lot if you can find at least one other person to help you start the group.    You can also try getting in touch with the Contemporary A Cappella League and get a listing on the group directory, though I suspect that gets about the same amount of traffic as /r/acalfg...

acappella,2bvy8z,PlaidDragon,1 point,Wed Dec 24 06:25:19 2014 UTC,"Vocal fry register:       The vocal fry register (also known as pulse register, laryngealisation, pulse phonation, creak, popcorning, glottal fry, glottal rattle, glottal scrape, or strohbass) is the lowest vocal register and is produced through a loose glottal closure which will permit air to bubble through slowly with a popping or rattling sound of a very low frequency.  During this phonation, the arytenoid cartilages in the larynx are drawn together which causes the vocal folds to compress rather tightly and become relatively slack and compact. This process forms a large and irregularly vibrating mass within the vocal folds that produces the characteristic low popping or rattling sound when air passes through the glottal closure. The very lowest part of the register can extend in rare cases to 20–50 pulses per second, or about two octaves below the lower part of the modal voice register (the normal voice).

acappella,2bgkai,AnOnlyMoose,9,Wed Jul 23 02:57:06 2014 UTC,"Hmmm, well this is a great question. (and one without a clear-cut resolution!) I feel like the real answer is that it depends on the arrangement. If you do a straight transcription of the song, 6 minutes will probably be too long to hold an audience's attention if the arrangement is an average one. However, mash-ups,  break-downs, jokes in the middle of the song and/or any other performance device will serve to keep the audience focused longer.   In general, you can never go wrong with leaving the audience wanting more. From an audience perspective, the novelty of collegiate a cappella covers is less tied up with musical excellence (no matter how much musicians wish it to be) and more in hearing songs that they recognize in a unique setting. Remember: 99.9% of a cappella groups are not Pentatonix and therefore are probably not as talented as the group that they are covering. However, this doesn't mean that they have to be any less entertaining - just differently so.  I was in a professional a cappella group for a while after college and some of our best songs were a minute and a half to two minutes. So don't be afraid to err on the side of caution and have multiple short songs in favor of a single, faithful recreation of all 8 minutes of A Stairway to Heaven.  (I've seen it done...it's not good)  That being said, the people who know your group and your audience best are you! Don't be afraid to call your own shots or innovate. The fact that you are even asking this question shows that you have the right end goals in mind for your performance so I'm sure whatever you decide it will turn out great. Good luck with your arrangement and concert and be sure to post it here so all of us on /r/acappella can enjoy it too!"
acappella,2bgkai,bizzo98,2,Wed Jul 23 05:04:56 2014 UTC,No further comments need :-P
acappella,2bgkai,previsualconsent,2,Wed Jul 23 05:13:04 2014 UTC,"The group I was in did a ~6 minute song, but it was a medley of songs, so it's not quite like your situation. Nonetheless, I think people liked our arrangement because they didn't lose interest over the course of the 6 minutes. The song changed up enough every minute or so to pique interest. If you can keep your arrangement interesting by adding a few cool moments within the song, it could work. I don't think it's too long for one singer, but if it's still a concern, perhaps you can have another soloist in the middle of the song (one of those ""cool moments"" you can put in!). It's all up to you. Feel free to experiment, and if it doesn't work out with the song length, it should sound just fine shorter."
acappella,2bgkai,gsyncer1,2,Wed Jul 23 05:34:20 2014 UTC,"My take is that you need to be able to break the song into segments that will state a musical idea, repeat it once or twice, and then combine it with or segue into another new idea.  This song is mostly the same few ideas but built up over time for the sake of creating an emotion arc that concludes at the end. It's worth noting that this has a pretty full and varied instrumentation. Small things happen in the background, such things prevent the audience from feeling like they're listening to something on loop. That said, nobody knows your group better than you and the other members of your group. Your primary objective is to arrange to them rather than to the source material, in my opinion. If you feel you can keep the suspense going for 6 minutes, have at it, but it's important that the arrangement not try to overstretch the capabilities of the group or the execution will fall apart and it's important that the audience hears something new and interesting as soon as they're familiar with an established idea in order to keep them paying attention. Individually, either one of these principles will trump the accuracy of the arrangement to the source material, and together, they definitely form a set of priorities that require first consideration before you look at the length, which as far as I'm concerned, doesn't matter as a raw number. What matters is execution in pacing.  My recommendation is that you focus on an interesting and performable arrangement and worry about time considerations afterwards. If it comes out to less than 6 minutes, I'd suggest that you don't stretch it unless you're willing to introduce something new to the arrangement."

We make sure that we sing as well as possible and don't do any choreography. We applied for the '12 '13 and '14 ICCA seasons and we got in all three times and did decently.   I've never heard of anyone getting turned down, I think if you show that you're obviously putting forth good effort, and you sing okay you should be fine. With all due respect to everyone who competes, because I know everyone works really hard, not everyone is at an elite level. There are some groups who are just happy to be there, and objectively don't perform nearly as well as other groups. Varsity Vocals stands by the fact that even though it is a competition, that we should be there to enjoy and share a cappella with each other. So if you work up your tunes to singable levels, I would just focus on the singing, don't worry about the choreo, and you should be fine for getting in.   My best advice for your first year competing is to do a set that is within yourself. Don't look up the championship videos and try to directly emulate them. You have to put something together that you can confidently pull off, not something that you think is impressive on paper. It's easy to think that you should get the best, most complex, earth shattering arrangements, along with elaborate complex choreography so you can blow the judges socks off. But the reality is that not every group is capable of those types of performances. It is really obvious when a group is trying to execute a set that they aren't really ready for.   You should do choreo for the show, but keep it simple. A number with less movement executed very cleanly is WAY better than something complicated that looks messy.   The songs you should sing at the contest are the ones that you feel most confident in. My advice for new groups is to pick a set for your Fall concert, 5-6 songs or whatever, then pick the three best ones from that concert and use it for your ICCA set.    Also, it's good to remember that nothing that anyone else does in their set has anything to do with your set. If you're in the crowd and you see someone doing something awesome, you have to resist the urge to compare it to yours and feel like you should have done something different. Just go out there and rock what you've prepared.  At Oregon State there is a lot of good a cappella tradition. I don't know what your relationship with Divine and Outspoken is, but if I were you I would connect with them directly and ask them the same questions face to face. If possible, I would perform for them and see if they would give you notes. Then they can perform for you and you can give them notes. Like a team. It's good performance experience and will give you helpful information.  I hope this was helpful, if you have any more questions or thoughts you can let me know. I love ICCA haha, so I can talk about it and talk about a cappella forever. Let me know!  edit: I watched your Radioactive and Say Something videos on youtube. Solid sound, you should have zero trouble getting accepted into the contest!"
acappella,2b6fka,Nolongerlurkin,1 point,Sun Jul 20 02:17:38 2014 UTC,"Thanks! The reason I ask about the pronouncation is because a lot of my a cappella friends on the east coast say it as one word.  And we are under the same time crunch (school doesn't start until September 29th and our auditions aren't until October 4th), so that is a relief that we can sing from sheet music if need be. And I was worried about getting turned down, but it sounds like it shouldn't be that big of a deal as long as we don't send in the crappiest audition video.  And as far as the set, I was planning on staying within our means. We have a lot of motivated people, but all of them with varying levels of musicality - I don't want to freak them out with something too complicated when we can rock something simpler.  And with choreo, I agree with that. There are points when choreo can get too distracting or complex to the point where it hinders the music rather than helps the music.   Also, it's good to remember that nothing that anyone else does in their set has anything to do with your set. If you're in the crowd and you see someone doing something awesome, you have to resist the urge to compare it to yours and feel like you should have done something different. Just go out there and rock what you've prepared.   This part is going to be hard for me. I am a bit of a perfectionist and I want my group to shine. But I can make do. (Our president will keep me in check).  And Outspoken and Divine and our group have pretty good relations, so I will try to talk with them. The only problem is that the last time that Outspoken competed was 2011, but Divine competed in 2013 (they both got busy and decided not to compete). So, they may be as unfamilliar with some topics as I am. (I competed in ICHSAs about 2ish years ago).  And thanks for the additional support! I'll be sure to hit you up with a message if I need anything!   And another random question: what group are you a part of?  edit: Thank you for your comments about our sound! :D"
acappella,2b6fka,Nolongerlurkin,3,Sun Jul 20 02:39:29 2014 UTC,"You sound like a really motivated guy who wants his group to have a good time. That's really awesome. Times will get tough but having someone like you who is really motivated really helps pick up the group quite a bit.   I'm friends with some groups in that areaish. Headband at WIllamette, and The Green Note at PSU. Both of those groups competed last year and if you have any connections there that could potentially be helpful.   I thought of one more thing. I think you should clearly define your goals for the contest then work HARD to achieve them. This could be anything from winning the national championship all the way down to just wanting to get accepted, I imagine you'll probably fall somewhere between those two :p   But really, you could simply say ""i want us to go out there and perform the set as well as we ever have performed it."" That could be a solid goal. But it just seems like having a goal in mind keeps me on the right track.   I hesitate telling you what group im from because we haven't had crazy ICCA success haha.   '12 Outstanding Arrangemrnt '13 Ourstanding VP '14 3rd Place, Outstanding Soloist, Outstanding Choreographer (that one  was me :D)  Nada Cantata at Central Washington University  Our 2013 set  Our 2014 Set"
acappella,2b6fka,Nolongerlurkin,1 point,Sun Jul 20 02:53:28 2014 UTC,"Thanks! And I have connections with some people in Divisi and possibly in Mind the Gap that I will talk to.   PC's president and I have talked and we have a goal similar to that - we want to go to ICCAs and say that we are proud of the outcome. And I feel like it should be possible - it will just require some hard work! :D  And I know of your group! I've seen some videos of you guys, and I wouldn't be worried about the success thing, you do have the PLU groups at your quarterfinal (and both of them are typically pretty freaking good). You guys are a good group, you just have some pretty good competition."
acappella,2b6fka,Nolongerlurkin,1 point,Sun Jul 20 03:08:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah for sure PLUtonic and HERmonic are always solid. This last year was my last year but I'll probably be arranging/doing choreo next year too just no singing/directing. The contest has been growing a low. Not sure what they're going to do when there are more than 10 Washington groups and 10 Oregon groups to fit in along with the Texas and Utah groups that they put up here sometimes. If you get placed in the Washington quarter i'll probably be at that contest. for the first time as an audience member.   Like I said, good luck, be confident, and have fun!  I am interested to know if you watched our 2014 set. We're always interested to know if everything in the staging was clear. It's not often that we get input from people who don't know anything about it."

acappella,2b10yt,jpi95,6,Fri Jul 18 07:00:57 2014 UTC,"Over the course of 6 years at UChicago I incrementally designed and built a system that has grown to be on par with what professional sound production companies can provide. I'll try to give some insight into how it came together that hopefully can help.  One key aspect was working with other groups on campus to make it a collaborative purchase, which spread out the cost to cover a larger number of students, and made a more compelling sales pitch to the school for funding. I also created an a cappella council student organization separate from any individual group to manage it, such that all a cappella groups had fair and equal access, but non-a cappella groups were prevented from using/abusing it. (As a side note, the main reason I started this organization was to keep inter-group relations open and cordial as everyone started to get more serious about a cappella--because I didn't want resentment to build over stupid stuff like I had seen on other campuses.) One other selling point for actually owning equipment on campus is that, since you're likely going to rely on students outside of your group to run sound for shows, it creates a great opportunity to learn a huge amount about live sound production (sure the results may be less than professional at least while they get their feet wet, but it's a fantastic opportunity to gain experience that would otherwise be very difficult to get).   When you're on a somewhat limited budget, you have to build the system in stages--but always keep a vision of what you'd ultimately like to have (i.e. avoid buying things that must be replaced when when you upgrade some other part of the system whenever possible). So for example, in the first purchase, we only could afford 6 wireless microphones. However, we spent proportionally quite a bit more on a 16 channel digital mixing board so that it could be scaled up to have many more mics, and would allow fancy mixing with effects when we had more money. Similarly, when we upgraded our speakers, we used our old speakers as on-stage monitors.  Also, realize that you'll also need a lot of accessories (e.g. cables, cases, stands--they add up in cost, and if you forget them, you're gonna have a bad time). In particular, unless your gear is going to live in a single venue with dedicated on-site storage, you need to leave room in your budget for quality cases to protect everything.  To give you some specifics, I made a copy of our inventory, so you can see exactly what we bought, when, and how much it cost. The total amount may look intimidating, but the initial purchase was much smaller (~$7,000). However, if you were to hire an outside production company to come in, you'd end up spending that much anyway after just a few big shows. If you buy it yourself, you have it forever and can use it as often as you want.   Let me know if you have more questions and good luck! :-)"
acappella,2b10yt,rishel,2,Sun Jul 20 03:22:27 2014 UTC,"Thank you Mr Rishel for your incredible post. This is exactly what I was looking for. Also, The idea to make it an acappella community investment is an AWESOME IDEA. I'm just curious if you happen to know (this is a big if) what the barebones version of this inventory would be that could mic the whole group (I.e minus some of the extra speakers and subs etc). If not this is still incredibly awesome"
acappella,2b10yt,rishel,3,Sun Jul 20 04:51:35 2014 UTC,"So one thing to consider is the natural breakpoints for the number of mics you want based upon what equipment exists. In general, these fall at 4, 8, 12, and 16 channels (and beyond). You're not going to find a 15-channel board, snake, etc., so if you want 15, you're going to have to buy everything (except the actual number of wireless systems) as a 16-channel system. If you can get by with 12 or even 8 (and are pretty certain you won't want to scale beyond that), you can save some money. However, wireless systems will by far be your biggest expense (at ~$500 per unit), so you should maybe consider buying the rest of the system to support up to 16 mics, and just buy less mics at first.  A barebones system with 15 mics would need:   a 16-channel mixing board (probably with a case) 15 wireless systems (i.e. handheld transmitter and receiver) Antenna splitters (how many you need will depend on the manufacturer, if you use Sennheiser's, you'll need 2--1 per 8 receivers). When you only have a handful of receivers, you can often get by without these (e.g. we didn't have them when we had 6 mics), but for 15, you definitely should get them. One or more portable rack enclosures for the receivers (hauling and setting up 15 loose receivers would be a nightmare). You'll see the notation ""(N)U"" used to describe racks. You can fit 2 receivers/antenna splitters per U, so you'll need at least 9U for 15 systems (8 for the receivers, 1 for the splitters). However, a racked power conditioner also needs a U, and if you ever add anything like a racked effects processor (e.g. octave), that's another U. You can do it all in one big 12U like I did, but that sucker is heavy with everything installed, so you might consider getting 2-3 4U cases instead. You might also need to buy kits to rack the receivers/antenna splitters One or more cases for the handheld transmitters A 16-channel XLR(m)-XLR(f) snake (to connect the receivers to the mixing board) 2 speakers (probably with bags, possibly with speaker stands/speaker stand bag depending on the speakers, also each speaker will need a long XLR(m)-XLR(f) cable to connect from the board to the speakers on stage) A power conditioner to protect your equipment. You might also need things like carts to help you move stuff safely around campus.   Regardless of what you end up buying, make sure to design the system with streamlining the setup and teardown as much as possible as a priority (as an example, I custom-mounted these into the inside of the receiver case so that I could keep the giant wallwart plugs inside safely connected during transportation, so you plug one power cord into the wall, flip one power switch, and everything turns on--just be careful to make sure your power conditioner/strips/extension cords are rated to handle the needed wattage).  For the two big expenses, you maybe could save money with alternatives:   I'd strongly vote for an all-digital mixing board since it offers so much flexibility, and I'm really head-over-heels for the price vs. performance of the Presonus boards. lf you could live with 12 mics, you could get the StudioLive 16.0.2 ($999), but for 15, you'd need a 16 channel board which in the Presonus line is a significant price jump (the 16.4.2 at $1999). One thing that may be an option is that the 16.4.2 supports chaining multiple boards together (so they act kind of like a single console), I don't know if the 16.0.2 can do this, but you could maybe buy the 16.0.2 with 12 mics and then buy a 2nd one later to go up to 15+ if it does. As far as wireless systems go, taking a look at what Sweetwater has available, there are cheaper options than the Sennheisers we used (~$550 per unit, so $8250 total), but I know nothing about them. In general, I'd be very careful about skimping too much on that front. Even the good wireless systems can sometimes be pretty finicky--having troubles finding clear channels on 4-5 mics can add significantly to setup time during sound check let alone issues during shows. I wouldn't recommend purchasing something much cheaper without getting specific endorsement from someone who has used them. Also, be sure the receivers can be rack-mounted in some way (I don't think many of the cheaper ones can).   One final thing to consider is purchasing refurbished (which would be fine and usually has a full warranty) or even used equipment (but this could require a bit more legwork on your end to find what you want and do what you can to make sure it's in good working order). You may also face some complications doing that if you are getting school funding and have to purchase everything through them/according to their policies.  Edit: Added links, because why not. I basically picked out the 2014 versions of a lot of what I put into the system I built since I know it works. They aren't the absolute cheapest options, but they aren't particularly deluxe either."

acappella,2b10yt,m1stertim,1 point,Sun Jul 20 06:13:02 2014 UTC,No problem at all. FYI I added some links and more info to the 2nd post. :-)
acappella,2b10yt,m1stertim,2,Sun Jul 20 06:41:16 2014 UTC,"Not a group, but a production company - we use 2 Neumann KM184s, or 4 if the group does a lot of choreo.  They're about $1500/pair.    Rode mics are a good place to start for condensers if you don't have much money.  A matched pair of Rode NT5s goes for about $400.  Could also use two NT1As, though I prefer small-diaphragm condensers for group performances.    Don't buy MXL mics if you can help it.    All of this stuff is available from Sweetwater.com"
acappella,2ayqb2,Renix,39,Thu Jul 17 16:11:59 2014 UTC,"You're making me choose?  You monster.  I'm not really kidding that much.  There's an incredible amount of greatness out there and you can even reach back before the Code Red era and find top-notch stuff.  Before that and tuning is generally just pretty poor compared to what you're used to hearing today; groups weren't as good, there weren't as many of them, and a cappella production was still in its infancy.  But these days any group with a little money and a lot of ideas can try for transcendence, even if they fall a bit short.  I have a lot of a cappella music and a lot of a cappella opinions, so here's a wall of text with my suggestions.  Let's start off with the Tufts Beelzebubs just to get them out of the way.  Practically anything they've done the last 10 years is solid gold but Pandæmonium and Play the Game are my go-to albums when I want to impress non-acapeople and ""Digging in the Dirt"" opb Peter Gabriel apb the Tufts Beelzebubs might just be the most dramatically intense of the bunch.  ""Paranoid Android"" opb Radiohead apb the Tufts Beelzebubs, which showcased just what Ed Boyer is capable of, and most especially the unbelievably awesome ""Vehicle"" opb the Ides of March apb the Tufts Beelzebubs (track 2) are great, too.  In fact, ""Vehicle"" might be my #1 acatrack, period.  Continuing with awesome Boston-based groups, Firedrill! needs to be mentioned.  ""If I Ain't Got You"" opb Alicia Keys apb Firedrill! might have my favorite single measure in a cappella—""three dozen ro-o-o-o-o-o-oses"" around 2:15—and even this low-quality recording will show you what they can do if you pump up your volume a bit.  But nothing compares to ""Can't Stop Thinking About You"" opb Martin Sexton apb Firedrill! which is an amazing song by an amazing artist.  Seriously, stop right here and check out Martin Sexton.  This is my personal breakup song because it is so overwrought that it gets out all the bad feels.  You want emotion in your music, you go to ""Can't Stop Thinking About You"", full stop.  Now let's look at some aca-originals.  First up, from the NYC-based group, is ""Young Leaders of Tomorrow"" opb Duwende, released on their free album just in time for the 2008 Presidential Election; it's eerie how well it parallels the political feelings of the time (and I'm not sure how purposeful that was).  Then we can go to ""Libertango"" opb the Swingle Singers, the inimitable consummate professionals from Britain; I saw them perform it live and they got a standing ovation in the middle of their set just for this song.  Next we'll look at Sara Bareilles' original collegiate composition, ""Gravity"" opb UCLA Awaken, the song that first got her noticed and a version that I think is vastly superior to the instrumental version she made on her debut album.  You'll recognize the main riff of ""You Were Everything"" opb The House Jacks as the background music from The Sing-Off, making it important all its own.  But my personal favorite aca-original easily goes to the radio-ready ""Don't Fix What's Broken"" opb Cadence.  I have long wished to pick out every last note, transcribe it for a conventional four-piece rock band (lead, rhythm, bass, drums, and everyone singing) and see how high it can get on the Billboard Hot 100.  This track is my response to anyone who derides a cappella as just a bunch of cover bands.  ""Leave Me Alone"" opb Hanna Pakarinen apb Fork ushers another great European group into the mix, this one a pedal-using bunch from Finland.  Clearly, SoJam loves them—and with good reason.  These guys asked to rappel in from the ceiling when they visited my school simply because that would be ""more epic"".  No joke.  They have a number of other great songs but they've been inactive for a while, sadly.  Another pedal group—former Sing-Off competitors now known as ARORA—did an unbelievable reimagining.  ""I Want You Back"" opb the Jackson 5 apb Sonos turns the song completely on its head in all the best ways.  ""The Sound of Silence"" opb Simon & Garfunkel apb the Stanford Harmonics is another total reimagining and holy crap, is it insane.  ""Walls"" at 4:13... oh, my.  Keeping on the dramatic reinvention tack, ""We Found Love"" opb Rihanna University of Chicago Voices In Your Head deserves all the accolades it's gotten for how well-staged the arrangement (and choreography) is.  And ""The Moment I Said It"" opb Imogen Heap apb the Cornell Chordials has some of the best vocal sound background sounds I've come across.  ""Hysteria"" opb Muse apb the Duke Pitchforks has some really amazing moments and actually manages to feel intimidating because of the rumbling growl the group throws around.  ""Ain't Nothing Wrong With That"" opb Robert Randolph & the Family Band apb the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Clef Hangers won the CARA for Best Male Collegiate Song for a reason... and it's everything about it.  I can't do a list like this without mentioning ""Hide and Seek"" opb Imogen Heap apb Transit because it probably the most technically perfect track I've ever heard.  Seriously, every last sound on this song is perfectly crafted.  And because it's upbeat, fun, uplifting, and extremely well-sung, ""Born This Way"" opb Lady Gaga apb Peter Hollens has wormed its way into my list of favorites.  And finally, bias alert, but my college group put out an amazing version of the Gary Jules version of ""Mad World"" that was runner-up for a Best Mixed Arrangement CARA.  This copy of ""Mad World"" opb Tears for Fears apb the Unversity of Rochester After Hours isn't the recorded version, but you get the point.  I also hold out hope that ""Samson"" opb Regina Spektor apb the University of Rochester After Hours will be up for an arranging CARA next year.  Proud alum is proud.  Also, /u/localglocal made an argument for some of the tracks on the Ben Folds University A Cappella album.  The only lasting collegiate track on this album in my opinion is ""Selfless, Cold and Composed"" opb the Ben Folds Five apb the Sacramento State Jazz Singers.  I don't think any of the others come even close to making the cut.  I will say, though, /u/ZaganOstia's recommendation of ""God Only Knows"" opb the Beach boys apb the UCLA Scattertones sure is fantastic.  And ""Daft Punk"" opb Daft Punk apb Pentatonix is great, but for me, nothing PTX does will ever top ""Run to You"" opb Pentatonix.  Oh my Whitacre, the harmonies.    Alright, I'll cut it off there; I've already written far too much and it's purely opinion as it is.  All that just scratches the surface, by the way.  Pick up the Sing series of albums and maybe the Voices Only and BOCA (Best of Collegiate A Cappella) series, too.  They're where the real fireworks are."

Check out these live recordings from tracks on their upcoming album. Holy. Crap.  Speaking of British groups, it doesn't get much better than the King's Singers.  Their recordings are always crisp and consistent.  Their old Beatles album is always on rotation in my playlist, and is probably one of the best albums I own.    It stands the test of all time. This is one of my favorites.  Do It A Cappella was one of the very first a cappella albums I ever owned.  It was from a PBS special by Spike Lee.  The whole program is online.  It features classic groups like Rockapella, The Persuasions, and the Mint Juleps.  It showcases the groups that got it right way before most.  I could go on (forever, probably) but these groups were some of the first groups I ever listened to, and it opened the door to a world of music that I never could have imagined liking as much as I have.

acappella,2az28r,JimmyMarshall,2,Thu Jul 17 18:01:14 2014 UTC,"I've been helping out my old secondary school teaching younger students some singing in my spare time this summer. One of the classes had 4 muslim students who followed a 'stricter' version of Islam than most of the other muslims in the school. They are allowed to sing a capella, but they are not allowed to sing to any accompaniment, live or recorded, other than unpitched drumming - which I believe leads to this type of music! It is really good!  Slightly related story: These boys are not allowed to play the keyboard in class. However, after learning more about it, one of the boy's fathers agreed that his son would be allowed to play the keyboard, to enhance his learning in school. This 10 year old boy was overjoyed come the next music lesson - he had literally never played a keyboard before and he was very excited! After a few minutes, one of the other muslim boys on the other side of the room turns around and says 'Allah will be ashamed of you'. Whole room goes silent. These kids are 10 years old! Teacher had no idea what to do. Thought I'd share."

acappella,2a87ym,Renix,3,Wed Jul 9 10:22:03 2014 UTC,"I'm in a semi-professional collegiate group - we get gigs, but we haven't made it big yet. Last year, our policy was after three unexcused you would be asked to leave (after a discussion about why you were missing so much). Luckily, this year we didn't need to have one.  I don't like making an attendance policy if I don't need one, but I was glad last year to have a line."
acappella,2a87ym,sun_spotting,2,Wed Jul 9 13:13:48 2014 UTC,"I agree. We have a similar rule in place that has really boosted attendance.   3 unexcused absences, and they have a meeting with the Business/Music Directors on why they are missing practice. Then they are on ""probation-"" Which is where they can not miss another minute of practice unexcused, or they are asked to leave the group. Missing something large- a recording, concert, or dress rehearsal- unexcused is an auto-probation.  I also add in things like excused absences (if people are having too much of those, they are asked to sort out their time commitments) and tardiness (being late counts as half of an unexcused absence)."
acappella,2a87ym,itsnickk,1 point,Wed Jul 9 14:56:35 2014 UTC,"Ours is very much like this too, but a little more lax because we are newer and don't get as many gigs. Attendance ""violations"" are divided into tardies, excused absences, and unexcused absences.   Coming more than 10 minutes late (or having to leave more than 10 min. early) is a tardy, and 3 tardies = 1 unexcused absence. 10+ absences, excused or unexcused, means you can't perform at the semester concert. 7+ unexcused absences means you'll be asked to leave."
acappella,2a87ym,AnOnlyMoose,1 point,Wed Jul 9 15:52:43 2014 UTC,"Ours is similar as well. I was in a collegiate group now going into its fifth year. Our official policy was that each member had a maximum of 3 absences with 3 tardies constituting one absence. If they exceed this limit, they cannot perform with the group for the rest of the quarter. We can grant exceptions on a case-by-case basis though, and we were generally lenient this year due to difficult scheduling issues.  However, if anyone's attendance becomes a problem, that person has an obvious commitment issue that needs to be addressed. The president has a discussion with that person, and after the president talks with the other officers, they may impose some kind of probation or dismiss them from the group. Luckily, we haven't had to deal with that very much this year, but in the cases it did become an issue, they came to us first and, in some of those cases, they voluntarily left the group."

We have no set attendance policy and so we have no set repercussions, but if it ever did become an issue the president would talk with the group member in question.  Despite our lack of written rules, essentially you don't miss unless you're incredibly sick, absolutely MUST study, or have some other emergency.

We have a set rehearsal attendance; 80% of all rehearsals, 50% of all small gigs, and 100% of large performances/concerts. Excused absences do not count toward attendance percentages. We also require 100% regular rehearsal attendance the week prior to big concerts. Excessive excused absences may result in suspension from the group performances, and if your attendance falls well below 80% you'll have to meet with the president to talk about it."

So far, no policy for how many rehearsals you can miss, we just expect you to be there.

But there are some amazing moments for this song to breathe that you kind of missed out on.  Especially towards the end of phrases.  In particular, in the chorus ""I'll run, I'll run, run to you.""  The third ""run"" is a bit clipped every time.  Go back and listen to the original PTX version.  Even though they add pauses, that word has depth and meaning to it.    That aside, you guys are incredible!  I come on here and see people trying to cover it, which is great!  But they all fall short.  You guys have come the closest to the original IMO."

Those are some of the most famous small ensembles that sing the kind of music you are looking for. If you give me a specific genre I can point you in the right direction more specifically.

acappella,2a4ei9,AnOnlyMoose,5,Tue Jul 8 06:04:26 2014 UTC,Capitalist A Cappella. Best person/song is sung. The person leaving likely won't care and the person who is gone can re audition it against the replacement soloist so the group gets the best version possible from the group.
acappella,2a4ei9,jpi95,4,Tue Jul 8 06:40:17 2014 UTC,"We always did a backup singer that would take it in that case, and otherwise a case-by-case basis. That smoothed things out for small performances too, as we didn't have much in the way of restrictions of what songs to do."
acappella,2a4ei9,wrii,1 point,Tue Jul 8 07:54:29 2014 UTC,"This is the way my group does it too - we have a backup soloist for every major solo, in case someone's sick or out of town."
acappella,2a4ei9,sun_spotting,2,Tue Jul 8 13:13:46 2014 UTC,"If someone graduates and the song is worth continuing to sing, re-audition immediately. Regardless, maintain back-ups for soloists. We had rules in the group regarding member status depending on time taken off, but in short, if you were gone for a semester, you'd get your solo back when you returned. Otherwise it was case by case.  We also started limiting solos to 3 semesters when we had a limited repertoire, so an audience could hear our range as a group even if we were singing the same songs. So much viva la vida..."
acappella,2a4ei9,ArtScrolld,2,Tue Jul 8 13:50:41 2014 UTC,"Graduated senior songs are totally fair game to continue using. If the graduate cares, tell them 1. to get over it 2. it's literally just a college a cappella group, then remind them to get over it."
acappella,2a4ei9,Renix,2,Tue Jul 8 14:08:37 2014 UTC,"I'll take a different tack and instead suggest that you simply bring in more songs. If you start having people learn them outside of rehearsal then you'll have a much greater ability to learn songs. A larger repertoire means that you don't have to worry as much about people leaving and songs disappearing. Plus you don't have to deal with the jealousy of someone else singing your song, which can certainly be present despite this being college a cappella."
acappella,2a4ei9,garrettthenotlarge,2,Tue Jul 8 14:23:51 2014 UTC,Just replace them with the best person available. It's not personnel its for the good of the group.
acappella,2a4ei9,Nolongerlurkin,1 point,Wed Jul 9 06:36:56 2014 UTC,"We re-audition every song every year. So sometimes someone will have the same solo all 4 years they're in the group, sometimes they'll only have it for 1. There are no hard feelings at all so that could work.   When we have people study abroad we have the runner up from the vote when we initially had the audition sing the solo, since we know when people will be away well before the year starts.  If it's a last minute thing, like someone is sick the day before a gig the Director picks someone, usually also whoever was the runner up from the vote."
acappella,2a4ei9,rothie,1 point,Thu Jul 10 01:15:43 2014 UTC,"With my group, when someone gets a solo, it's for the rest of their college career, and when he graduates, if we keep the song in the repertoire we re-audition the song. We designate a backup, but to be honest he's rarely ever used, and the solo does not automatically transfer to the backup if the soloist graduates.   I think we're fortunate to have a large and diverse enough repertoire that even if someone were to go abroad, we just sing other songs. our music director was abroad for a semester last fall, and he has a few solos, but we had enough songs to not have to worry about his absence too much.  Since you are a newer group, I think this is actually a good way to force you guys to build your repertoire more. I'd encourage more people to arrange songs and just have more flexibility in that regard."

Some chords sound wayyyyy to crisp to sound non-autotuned, but the lead singer sometimes is a bit off (at least I think),   I'm not sure what they did to make it sounds like this, but the arrangement is awesome.

acappella,2a4ay7,GeorgetheAttractive,1 point,Tue Jul 8 05:13:07 2014 UTC,"Hey there!   I'm afraid that there isn't much for high school groups. There is a division of the ACDA (American Choral Directors Association) that deals with a cappella music for high schools and you could reach out to some other students or choral directors in your area who are in a cappella groups and try and talk shop. You could also look into making your group a member of CASA (Contemporary A Cappella Society... Don't ask me how the acronym works) - I am not a member, but I hear that there is a lot of good info there. But other than that, there isn't much. If you want an active online community, this is probably your best bet - it isn't tailored to a specific branch of a cappella, but it will do.  If you want to try and participate in ICHSAs and you have questions, I would talk to Andrea Poole (http://varsityvocals.com/contact/our-team/). She is the director of ICHSAs and she is very responsive to emails. Also, I would reference all of the application materials too (http://varsityvocals.com/competitions/apply/icca-ichsa-regular-season/). I am currently trying to get my second year group to ICCAs; so, I am following these guidelines to the 't' and it makes the process pretty smooth.  I hope this all helps!"

acappella,29zwky,jhill066,1 point,Sun Jul 6 21:48:35 2014 UTC,"Good start! I have some musical suggestions, and some more general comments.    First off, blending exercises will help a lot in a better blend in the group. It's a little off sometimes, but practice can bring that into a nice tone within the group. Second, energy is way low for you guys. Some of the guys didn't move at all. My group suffered the same problem- in fact, that was me not moving through the song a year ago. You guys need to become more comfortable in your own skin while dancing. You seem to have a good crowd energy, and kind of lean towards a general comical, feel-good style, but you need everyone in the group to get into the song or it looks awkward. You guys should be dancing like crazy up there, or at least looking like you're having fun!  I suggest when you practice, blowing everything way out of proportion with your emotions and dancing. Chances are, you will look exactly how you want- because you perceive yourselves to be putting off more emotion than you actually are. Also, just take a minute every practice and just dance. It will get you comfortable with moving around and not be afraid to do it awkwardly.  Of course, some sort of choreo can go a long way- on the first ""I show you how to do this, son!"", that point should be very energetic when everyone jumps in. Besides adding energy, you could add a motion where everyone moves in for that line, and then backs into a different formation. Staying in the arc is a classic a cappella formation, but can get taxing to watch without movement.  A style of clothing or shared color can go a long way in group identity. The falsetto from everyone, soloist and tenors, could use some work. It sounds weaker than it should. That comes with practice, and basically every problem can be chalked up to breathing in that case. I don't know if it's in the budget or available, but mics always make it better. I see the soloist counting out- I have to guess that is the musical director. I think more soloist involvement with the crowd and the solo in general would go a long way- someone else should be doing the counting and tempo and let him focus on his own singing. Because, let's be honest, the soloist is the main focus for the audience.   In all, good! Keep it up! can't wait to see more in the future from you guys."

acappella,29zwky,itsnickk,1 point,Tue Jul 8 22:40:35 2014 UTC,This Exercises and Warm-Ups Thread I made a couple days ago should help! Look in the Blending section.
acappella,29zwky,AnOnlyMoose,1 point,Wed Jul 9 01:20:11 2014 UTC,"Woohoo! Good start is right. One thing I'm thinking that could help in several ways is writing some more rhythmic parts into the arrangement. A few aspects/comments about that:  -More movement in a more upbeat song like this makes it more complex and forces the audience to listen closer/pay more attention.  -Moving parts also force your group to keep better tempo & counting, so the music director won't have to work as hard during the song. Also, someone else please correct me if I'm wrong, but I felt the group was rushing a bit by the end because they had a lot of block chords; those are easy to cut short, and over the course of a song can make you skip a beat or two. That makes it look like the song is getting away from you, and you always want to be showing off your control/command of the music.  -As far as the mechanics of how you can implement more movement, see this version done by the professional group VoicePlay. Obviously they're pretty advanced, but notice how they mix block chord/melody harmonization sections with sections where there's several different things going on. When you're doing songs like this, moving bass parts can do a lot to add that extra layer--but obviously they work a whole lot better when you're able to mic your bass. Otherwise, moving tenor parts (which are easier to hear without mics) will work too, with your basses holding down the fort at the bottom with longer tones.  I like what I saw here, though! You guys are on the right path; keep working!"
acappella,29xe84,Knobbser,3,Sat Jul 5 22:30:20 2014 UTC,Excellent ending! The parts blended well together and sounded great.
acappella,29xe84,biffspiffington,3,Sun Jul 6 07:13:29 2014 UTC,"Phenomenal.  A+.   Edit: As I continue to listen, there were some really interesting choices in here.  You guys should really have taken things down a key or two to help those higher solos and maybe cut a song or two.  It's really fun though!  Good job!"

acappella,29vnpc,odrin,4,Sat Jul 5 05:03:52 2014 UTC,I really like this video. The quality is shitty but it is still a live take. There are some groups on youtube who ONLY have multitracked mixed and mastered audio on their channels. The live videos PTX has like You Da One and End of Time are some of my favorites just because it feels a little bit more authentic.

acappella,29tozl,Wavepermlovedog,2,Sat Jul 5 06:13:09 2014 UTC,"his tone is VERY forward and sitting right on the vocal chords. There is almost no resonance to it. Despite being able to sing low, he isn't singing like a BASS."

However, the lead girl, although she's quite talented, isn't the star that she's being framed as I think within the group and their videos.  If they want to do this format and be as big as they appear to aspire to be, they need a star -- they have all the parts and they are very very talented.    I for one think that the baritone/tenor guy should be the face of this group.  This isn't a criticism of the lead girl, as she's quite good.  Just an observation.  Anyone agree?"

acappella,29oh7y,Keplz,2,Mon Jul 7 19:51:26 2014 UTC,"One thing we do is we sing a C-major scale, quarter notes, at 80 bpm.  Going up, everyone counts, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and when we hit the top note of the octave, Tenor 1 stays on the octave, while everyone else goes back down the scale, saying the numbers backwards.  Tenor 2s hold 5 (The fifth), Baritones hold 3, and Basses go all the way down to 1.  The pitch will then signal for everyone to change their vowel to ah, and we try to get perfect blending.  Once this is achieved, pitch signals 3's to go down half a step, then 5 up half a step, 3 up half a step, then 3 up another half step, then 1 and 8 up a half step until the entire group is on a D-flat major chord.  Pitch cuts off the group and signals different vowel sounds to make (oh, ooh, etc.) on the D-flat major chord.  Once, I tried experimenting with different chord progressions, but I lost all of the papers where I wrote down these experiments."

acappella,295mc2,ianmboyd,3,Thu Jun 26 23:27:54 2014 UTC,Naw man. Don't let your group be held back by arranging. If you have no one who can arrange totally do other people's arrangements and just credit them in the program. It's all about having fun and singing good music.

I saw them at LAAF (Los Angeles A Cappella Festival) and they all just kinda had this super smug persona like they knew they were better than everyone else and that they were a big deal. I've always thought that a cappella should be more of a fun thing that unites groups together (which is fortunately the case for most groups I've met) so it bugged me when I saw that in them. Then they got eliminated in the first round..."
acappella,295e9u,guitardude911,2,Fri Jun 27 02:17:57 2014 UTC,"Really? They don't come off as that kind of type to me. If it were true, I would honestly be disappointed because their music can be amazing (Bottom of the River?). If I recall correctly, they won ICHSA two years ago. That, however, does not give them the right to brag.   I find it hard to believe that they would be like that. However, I've only seen them on screen. It is totally possible that they act different in person. I wholeheartedly agree that acapella music should unite musicians, rather than be a competition of who is more talented."
acappella,295e9u,guitardude911,1 point,Fri Jun 27 02:35:33 2014 UTC,"Actually, the group that did Bottom of the River and won ICHSA a couple years back was basically a different group. Since it's a high school group, a lot of them graduated so the current group only has a fraction of those members remaining. It could have been an unfortunate thing where I just happened to see them on a bad day, but for the most part it's a different group than the one that was on TV and all that."
acappella,295e9u,guitardude911,2,Fri Jun 27 02:40:07 2014 UTC,"That's my only problem with groups centered around a rotating group of members. I believe in two years, none of the members from the winning ICHSA group will have graduated. From the perspective of a fan, it is hard to stay attached to a group that won't resemble what you came for in a few years."

Sometimes a group needs a directator to take control in situations like this and keep it alive. As director, you might get some of the credit if the group is successful, but you'll definitely get most of the blame if it fails -- and rightly so. It is your responsibility to keep things moving. Sometimes that means brainstorming and doggedly finding new ways to light a fire under your fellow members, and sometimes that means bearing the cross yourself.   tl;dr It's your job to motivate them to help, but in the meantime do it yourself."

acappella,28wr7r,Subject81A,6,Tue Jun 24 02:00:11 2014 UTC,"The first thing I was told when I became music director of my group was this: when it comes to music, democracy sucks. You're the arranger, you're running rehearsals, you are the one who knows what's best for the group. That's not being immodest; it's literally your job description. Arrange what you think will serve the group best and get feedback after the fact. If people have a problem with the way you're doing things, you'll be able to tell, at which point you can start to cut others into the discussion. But if they aren't letting themselves be cut into it now, then take it all the way and do what you know is best. Many MDs would kill for that kind of autonomy!"

acappella,28wr7r,jessmars,2,Tue Jun 24 02:00:22 2014 UTC,When our group first started our goal was to be collaborative and democratic as possible and long story short it was a mess. Decision making and efficiency took a huge boots when we switched to a small group of leadership making all the decisions for the group. We had three people do all the arrangements and choose all of the songs for the year. We would certainly ask for suggestions but in the end we just pick because it's much faster. The group learned to just trust us. It eliminates long conversations and lets the singers just focus on the music.
acappella,28wr7r,Renix,1 point,Tue Jun 24 20:54:50 2014 UTC,"Honestly, arrange as much as you want. When it comes to next year and y'all are looking for arrangements you can say: ""I arranged these songs, what are y'all interested in singing first."" My group has two music directors to avoid a dictatorship (I am one of them) and really it works best if you can say ""We have these songs, but I'm open to arranging your suggestions."" That way you have backups and everyone will be happy!"
acappella,28wr7r,waitingforjune,1 point,Sun Jun 29 23:31:58 2014 UTC,Give them a dead line. Make a facebook poll or something and say I'm arranging what's got the most votes or w/e on X date and just do it. Or just start arranging what you wanna arrange. Groups are much more inclined to do an song when the arrangement is already there.

acappella,28dupd,DarcyIsPhoenix,3,Tue Jun 17 22:18:09 2014 UTC,Thanks Darcy.  If you like the arrangement you should definitely check out the Matt Corby cover of the song too which had some influence.  Do you sing in an a cappella group as well?
acappella,28dupd,alexcantatore,2,Tue Jun 17 23:09:13 2014 UTC,I am in a coed a capella group at Dickinson College. We've only been around for about 5 years but we are starting to get our own sound and find our place on campus! We find a lot of our inspiration from reddit a capella groups. I shared this video with my group and they absolutely love it.
acappella,28dupd,DarcyIsPhoenix,3,Tue Jun 17 23:11:01 2014 UTC,Oh sick.  I know what it's like trying to bring a new group to prominence - my college group at Emerson was just a baby when I got started there.  It's a tough haul but totally worth it!  Do you guys have a Facebook page/Twitter or anything that Fermata Town can follow?  We definitely appreciate the support!

acappella,286p6v,SVGLileli,3,Sun Jun 15 06:08:44 2014 UTC,"This article gives a lot of tips for technique for beatboxing. If you have no experience beatboxing or attempting to, it will take a long time to master simple beats, but with practice, figuring out which techniques work best for you.  For singing lower notes, I don't know the secrets of singing lower than a natural bass without wrecking your voice, but to sing lower without grinding your vocal cords, relax your jaw, let it drop to be tall, and used a relaxed voice to go lower. Try playing with a piano to test your range and see how low you can go before you grind your vocal cords, and that usually marks the bottom of your range.  I use Virtual Piano as a quick way to check, since you can make the letter of a note appear over its key. Your range sounded a little TOO large, so I'd recommend testing it with a Piano  Good luck with your a capella goals!"

I have dabbled around in beat boxing before, I could get a simple beat but i'm looking to further it.   That's what I thought, I just wondered how people managed to get lower and lower to be honest, Avi (I will use this example alot xD He's probably the most well known out of the vocal basses I could speak of) went from A1 to F#1 as his lowest note, I was just curious on if this was a technique he used or if he simply didn't use his vocal chords.  Can I ask what grinding sounds/feels like? I feel that A1 is grinding my vocal chords a lot, it sounds almost fry-ish, like that?  Thank you very much! I will do it again with a piano, I was using a tuner and matching the Hz to notes, I took off quite a bit since my apparent highest was a whistle, though i'm not sure if falsetto counts.  Thank you very much, you're an awesome person!"

They aren't so much singing the note, as much as they are croaking it and the sound guy is able to crank up those frequencies to make it resonate."

acappella,286p6v,tehm,1 point,Mon Jun 16 04:01:17 2014 UTC,"No problem! Grinding your vocal cords is a result of singing below your range and forcing your voice to go lower than it can. Gradually go lower with a relaxed voice, and when your bottom note goes from softer and more relaxed to louder and more forced, that is grinding your voice. It's hard to describe, but it's not good for your voice in the long run, same with belting above your range to the point that it hurts to sing.  Music in general takes a long time to master, so I hope you continue to work at it and improve! You can ask me any more questions you may have and I will try to answer them to the best of my ability."
acappella,286p6v,BigBrainiac1337,1 point,Sun Jun 15 07:07:35 2014 UTC,"So it's damaging them permenently basically? Is there any excercises i should always do before singing? I try to warm up but I don't know how long for so I may be doing it wrong. I'll keep in my range right now and go gradually, I think going lower should be a priority since my higher pitches are clearer.   Yeah, I learned a few instruments and it's taken a while xD I am very grateful! Thank you :) Does Hz to notes work btw?"
acappella,286p6v,JewBot6000,1 point,Sun Jun 15 07:21:09 2014 UTC,"Excessive grinding does permanent damage since it continually uses your vocal cords in ways they were not meant to be used. Little bits of it doesn't damage, but a habit of grinding does.  Before singing, do whichever warm ups work best for you. The main point of warming up is like a warm up for any muscle. It prevents injury in your voice, so warming up should prevent you from feeling hoarse after singing. Usually scales work well, and using different vowel sounds as you go helps to open your voice. Start with ""ah""s or ""zee-ah"" to practice using and shifting between both nasal and throat centered tones. But whatever works best for you and keeps you from being hoarse after singing usually works fine.  Hz to notes works, but I don't know of any musicians who use it :P"

I'm not gonna pretend I'm an all-knowing music god, but I feel like you should crank up the bass in your arrangements. A solid bass/baritone line can really broaden the sound of a piece. You're an all-male group, use that to your advantage! Otherwise, congrats on forming a group!"

acappella,27r3pq,a3leong,5,Tue Jun 10 02:20:52 2014 UTC,"More pads. I feel like groups never have enough pads/put three people singing one ancillary lyrical line when in truth it's best to pick one person who can project and hold that line and free up others to do something else.  I'm a fan of using only one bass bc it's easier to tune to and if you use a micd bass then the other guy gets left out anyway.  Don't just copy paste every note you put down should have a WHY attached.  The biggest thing for me is to find an emotional connection which usually starts with lyrics. The lyrics shape the true story of the piece and thus shape the arrangement.  Also I try to see a group performing the arrangement on stage to get a sense of where the ""moments"" of the piece should be.  Happy to get other feedback on this as I too am interested what others have to say!"
acappella,27r3pq,jpi95,0,Tue Jun 10 05:38:23 2014 UTC,"I agree on the having one bass because it's easier to tune. My high school's group went to competition and I was the only bass and we nailed every performance (not to mention our EQ was amazing), but i totally agree"
acappella,27r3pq,Wavepermlovedog,1 point,Tue Jun 10 07:10:54 2014 UTC,"Someone else posted this but my goal every time is to ensure that there are a few key moments in the sing which draw the audience in. These could be a huge dynamic change, unison, drop outs, huge chords, splices or whatever. I also find that listening to the sing a few times with a pen and paper in hand before getting to the sheet music makes for a much much smoother experience."
acappella,27r3pq,garrettthenotlarge,1 point,Tue Jun 10 07:21:44 2014 UTC,A small thing that can make a huge difference for me is lyrics. I hear a lot of arrangements where the background ensemble is ONLY singing on vowels the entire time. dah doo din din la jang etc etc whatever. Having big moments where the entire ensemble is singing the lyrics of the solo can be incredibly effective. An entire full homophonic section at the beginning of the last chorus is a good one. But also having the solo lyrics displaced in different rhythms from the soloist in verses can be nice.   In general my biggest arranging advice is contrast in every aspect. The lyrics is one way to accomplish that.
acappella,27r3pq,Nolongerlurkin,1 point,Tue Jun 10 19:03:39 2014 UTC,Could you explain contrast a little more? Do you mean like having distinction between different sections in the arrangement?
acappella,27r3pq,Renix,1 point,Tue Jun 10 23:39:53 2014 UTC,"Casual 28 day later response.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJYNxMyKCjE  Check this out video, what he's describing happens a lot throughout here.  Starts with dms -> doo -> doh -> dah to open up the sound with each phrase.   :32 ensemble switches to singing the text of the soloist, albeit a difference rhythm. Then switches back to rhythmic doos etc to liven up the texture again.   1:00 ensemble is singing the soloists lyrics rhythmically staggered throughout.  1:30 singing the main motif of the soloist at different rhythmic times.  You get the idea.   Jump to the end.   4:30 starts mashing up all the chorus solo lines over each other for a highly contrapuntal texture. so when we get to 5:00 it returns to stay the night from the beginning, but with everyone singing the soloists texts as a big homophonic moment. Very powerful.  Cheers!"
acappella,27r3pq,Nolongerlurkin,1 point,Wed Jul 9 10:45:51 2014 UTC,"Contrast in the most broad sense. I guess this has a little to do with performance as well but....louder louds, softer softs. Not every song calls for it but if you can try to have spots with 1/10 volume and 9/10 volume. If your choruses and verses sound exactly the same, try havin the second verse with a different feel or have everyone drop out for a bar. The biggest enemy of an acappella arrangement is just 4 bars of music being slapped down and copy pasted for 4 minutes."
acappella,27r3pq,Nolongerlurkin,1 point,Wed Jun 11 01:44:19 2014 UTC,"You don't want it to sound like chaos but if you're repeating a chorus for the third time and it's exactly the same as the other two I would really ask yourself WHY are you repeating it at all? Switch it up and make one different and exciting in some way. With volume, key change, new texture, new rhythms etc"
acappella,27r3pq,jpi95,1 point,Wed Jun 11 01:46:04 2014 UTC,"One of the best tips a clinician ever gave me was that Audiences are stupid and have the attention spans of four year olds. So you have to constantly shake ""shiny"" interesting things at them to demand their attention. Whether that means inserting lyrical background parts or runs or introducing another soloists or whatever. Never give the audience a CHANCE to get bored.   Also I heard somewhere that the distribution of parts in a song should be like a bell curve and thought it made a ton of sense.  Also the 1-3-4 chord is the shit. Just saying.  And also KNOW THE VOICES OF THE GROUP. Every person. Inside and out. Know who can do crazy things/hold their own part and who can't."
