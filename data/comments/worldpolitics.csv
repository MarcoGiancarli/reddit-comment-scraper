Not even the Generals in what remains of the Pentagon or the New York papers calling for WAR seem to know who did it or where to look for them.  This is going to be a very expensive war, and Victory is not guaranteed — for anyone, and certainly not for anyone as baffled as George W. Bush.

In an ironic way, by removing the passion and disgust for these criminal adventures; and entertaining (not accepting) Clark's premise; such a policy may provide the political means necessary to first define and eventually end the war.

We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know what no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution.

The legal system will still go after politicians for more personal crimes like corruption or assault or whatever, but the ramifications of taking on the really big stuff like war crimes are so huge that the legal system seems to institutionally lack the guts to take it on.    The thing is that saying to a head of state or former head of state 'You have ordered a crime against humanity and we are going to put you on trial for that' is really scary to a prosecutor or judge.  It's a staggering amount of power they'd be taking for themselves with unknown precedential ramifications, even though by the letter of the law they have the power and the duty to do it.  There's the very real worry that future governments will constantly attack political leaders for partisan gain rather than because anything genuinely criminal was done.  I do come down in what might be the minority camp that the legal system should and must live up to its duty to prosecute all crimes, no matter how large or small and no matter who commits them.  I feel that we can deal with any consequences as they come, and in the now the precedent that a leader can order the commission of crimes with personal impunity for that action is too heinous to be allowed to stand."

[Wesley Clark]  We've got to identify the people who are most likely to be radicalized. We've got to cut the this off at the beginning. There are always a certain number of young people who are alienated, they dont get a job, they lost a girlfriend, their family doesnt feel happy here.  And we can watch the signs of that, and there are members of the community who will reach out to those people and bring them back in, and encourage them to look at their blessings here.  But i do think, on a national policy level we have to look at what self-radicalization means, because we are at war with (ehm) this group of terrorists. They do have an ideology, in world war two, if someone supported Nazi Germany at the expense of the united states, we didnt say it was freedom of speech, we'd put them in a camp, they were prisoners of war.  So if these people are radicalized, and they dont support the united states, and they're disloyal to the united states, as a matter of principle, fine, that is their right, and it is our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict. And i think we're going to have to be increasingly get tough on this, not only in the united states, but also in our allied nations like in Britain Germany and France, are going to have to look at their domestic law procedures.   The stuff about ""community who will reach out to those people and bring them back in"" is just a smoke screen. Salon infact has done pretty much zero sensationalism.  Wesley Clark is completely wrong. This is not like WWII at all, and saying ""people have the right to X, but then we will lock them up"" is plain Orwellian.

This is because whenever you're dealing with someone else, you always have to take into account the other guy's frame of mind.  In this case, as a diplomat or national leader, I have to at least consider the possibility that someone like Netanyahu will think I'm an anti-Semite if I criticize or disagree with Israel's policies in general, or his own positions in particular.

Israel does a lot of bad stuff (along with many other countries) and rightly deserves the criticism it receives. That criticism is deserved and doesn't make someone anti-semitic.   On the flip side you have people that want to blame EVERYTHING on the zionists. Everything the United States does, everything that goes wrong with the world, everything is the zionists. The very real problem with this outlook is that you can interchange jew and zionist without really changing the meaning of your statement. People will argue all day long they have nothing against the jews, it's the zionists they have a problem with - but they simply don't understand that you can't separate these two, it's one and the same.  Now you may disagree with the premise of the jewish belief that God ordained that they should be the rightful inheritors of Israel - that's a perfectly understandable perspective to have, the problem is many of those people take it one step to far and their entire perception of the world revolves around blaming everything that goes wrong in the world, on them - which makes jewish people rightfully paranoid."

worldpolitics,3dyks5,uncleawesome,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:39:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. Zionist Jews aren't responsible for everything. But they are responsible for a hell of a lot of things.   What makes Israel different is that as much as they try they can't dismiss or deny what's happening completely; the situation in Palestine is ultimately concrete and can't be spun into just antisemitic ""conspiracy"".  Speaking of other things Jews are arguably responsible for: as for Europe, half of their attitude towards Palestinians and against Israel is driven by the existential terror that displacement by Muslims represents.  They think this little piece of moralizing-cum-capitulation will save them from their coming extinction (or the possible bloodbath that could go either way), but they are wrong."

worldpolitics,3e2xo0,ME24601,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:49:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, how horrendous a crime to sell tissue to companies claiming/planning to use it in medical research. Much better to let it rot as biowaste so it can be used by absolutely no one for any purpose whatsoever.  What a fucking waste."
worldpolitics,3e2xo0,fashowbro,7,Tue Jul 21 15:47:30 2015 UTC,"Planned Parenthood is Federally funded.  That's why it's such a big deal.    This is Dr Mary Getter.  The President of the Planned Parenthood's Medical Directors Council (about as high as you can get) offering to have her doctors use unnecessary/impractical abortion techniques on unsuspecting patients in their late 1st, early 2nd trimester so as the ""specimens"" will be the most intact. And she's haggling for $100 a piece!  Or whatever it is her people in California say is the best deal...she'll get back to us...  ""I want a Lamborghini"" out of this deal she says toward the end of the video.      Bottom line is these people are shady as shit and the PP president is totally oblivious to the fact it's undercovers setting her up.    Two videos like this released in just 5 days.  I gotta feeling this is only the beginning of some long standing Dr Mengele type shit that the public's been naively unaware of for too long.  Whether it's right or wrong is up for the public to decide."
worldpolitics,3e2xo0,schoocher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:30 2015 UTC,I've read the full transcript from the first video... that video was nothing more than a heavily edited hit job.  I'm not expecting this one to be any different.
worldpolitics,3e2xo0,fashowbro,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:44:29 2015 UTC,"How are these techniques unnecessary or impractical?  ""I want a Lamborghini"" was obviously a joke, also in obvious poor taste but a joke none the less. The big issue for me isn't whether it's happening, why it matters is beyond me, they aren't inducing people to abort babies so they can sell them. What they're doing is maximizing the efficiency of what they do. Keeping the tissue in biowaste doesn't make them less dead, but it may serve to help complete research that could help the currently alive. The real question would be: is this money being reinvested into the company to improve the medical care it provides or are a select few pocketing it for ""Lamborghini's""?"

The plain truth is that Israel can buy a hundred USS Libertys and kill 100,000 service men before Americans even think about throwing off their masters in industry, in congress, in the white house. Israel would anthrax America before it revolted. Sad but true."

But The Times has moved away from that, reflecting editors’ reasonable belief that the basics can be found in many news outlets, every minute of the day. They want to provide “value-added” coverage.""   ""Value"" according to the Jewish Zionist values of the owners of the NYT and much of its editorial staff?  I've always felt the New York Times had a fake-""liberal,"" pro-Jewish agenda designed to serve the limousine liberal and neocon 1%, and its pro-Zionist ""reporting"" on Israel/Palestine bears that out.  Now, finally, it's openly admitting that it's had its own social and political agenda that it has inserted into its ""reporting"" for god knows how long.  Divide and rule, Diaspora Zionist propagandists is all the New York Times ever was, and all it ever will be so long as it's owned and run by Zionists."
