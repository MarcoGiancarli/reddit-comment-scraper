That's the only test - have or not. I'll double check my build.  Edit - The problem is that you didn't pick up enough red and blue gems to qualify to pass through the portal. I had not anticipated a player getting up to the top and not picking up enough gems. I am already adding an arch that you will have to give up gems to pass through and thereby gain the powers to move blocks. Then at the top it will require another certain number to pass to the forest level (which is being removed from this game, as it has nothing to do with the game at all)."

freegames,32u78h,edhere,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:25:11 2015 UTC,You don't have to play it. Just leave it downloaded until the weekend ends and it will stick to your Library after.  But if you want to be sure just launch it once.
freegames,32u78h,edhere,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:28:33 2015 UTC,"It will be free-to-play.   Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?  “Fractured Space will transition to a Free to Play model upon release. We've ensured that our Founders Tiers are loaded with content, offering great value and exclusive items to our players before the official release of the game.”"
freegames,32qzvx,hearwa,2,Thu Apr 16 00:35:55 2015 UTC,Too bad there are regional restrictions so I cannot get it...Why would they do that?
freegames,32qzvx,AkiMatti,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:33:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know. It's weird, my girlfriend can't access some games that I can and we're both in Canada. I think she registered on amazon.ca and I registered on amazon.com. Did you do the same?"
freegames,32qzvx,AkiMatti,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:17:54 2015 UTC,I might've registered on amazon.co.uk. Cannot remember for sure though.
freegames,32qzvx,AkiMatti,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:02:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure if you register on amazon.com it should work. If you try it let me know, I'm curious!"
freegames,32qzvx,AkiMatti,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:29:48 2015 UTC,Maybe it is because my Country is Finland in the settings?
freegames,32qzvx,derpaherpa,1 point,Fri Apr 17 07:30:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, changing it to US did the trick but the game is no longer free..."
freegames,32qzvx,Avmarr,2,Fri Apr 17 07:31:24 2015 UTC,"Only the first episode, mind you."
freegames,32qzvx,Taiko,-5,Thu Apr 16 21:10:26 2015 UTC,I dont trust this.
freegames,32qzvx,Sco7689,4,Thu Apr 16 06:45:33 2015 UTC,Why not? Amazon is reputable. They give away free games a lot. Telltale Games are a reputable game company (most famous for The Walking Dead). Their games are generally episodic so they most likely want to get you started with a free one so you buy the others later.  What's not to trust?
freegames,32qzvx,Moresty,4,Thu Apr 16 07:07:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't understand either. :-/  Here's all the games I've gotten FREE off the amazon app store:  80 Days  Age of Zombies   Angry Birds Space   Angry Birds Star Wars II   Anomaly Warzone Earth HD   Beach Buggy Racing   Big River Fishing 3D   Bike Race Pro  Bingo Pop   Bridge Constructor   Call of Duty: Heroes  Carcassonne   Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink  Cut the Rope   Cut the Rope: Experiments   Dante: The Inferno   Doctor Who: Legacy   Doodle Jump   Down The Hatch   Dream Flight   Enigmo   Farming Simulator 14  Five Nights at Freddy's  Five Nights at Freddy's 2   Fruit Ninja   Game Of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series  Garfield's Escape   Glow Hockey 2 Pro   Guardians of the Galaxy: The Universal Weapon   Hunger Games: Catching Fire - Panem Run   Joining Hands   JoyJoy   Jump Birdy Jump   Luxor HD   Mini Warriors   Monopoly  Monsters Ate My Condo   Paper Monsters   Pinball Planet   Real Steel HD   Riptide GP2   Riptide GP2   RPG Soul Historica   Ski Safari: Adventure Time   Sonic CD   Sonic Jump   Sonic The Hedgehog 2   Sorcery! 2   Sparkle 2 Evo   Super Stickman Golf   Table Top Racing   Terraria   Tetris  The Hidden World   Thomas Was Alone   Townsmen Premium   Trivia Crack  World of Goo   Worms 3   But [s]he can believe what they want. :-)"
freegames,32qzvx,superiormind,3,Thu Apr 16 10:00:43 2015 UTC,"Wait, they gave out Sorcery! 2?  Ahh, missed that :(  BTW, you mentioned Riptide GP2 2 times instead of first and second."
freegames,32qzvx,MezzozzeM,2,Thu Apr 16 11:20:17 2015 UTC,"Nice catch, I copied that from my master spreadsheet of games owned on steam/origin/gog/google play/amazon app store. I will fix that. :-P  Protip: Check amazon app store every day. Also they have a deal where they give a couple hundred dollar worth of apps/games a few times a year. You can add games to your amazon cloud account easier on their website with your PC. I tend to add everything and now have a ridiculous number of apps."

freegames,32kffo,Dave_Sheep,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:39:36 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be better to define Free as truly free, no IAPs, ads, or anything. While this game looks very beautiful it sounds like it has ads."
freegames,32avb3,megaapple,3,Sun Apr 12 03:58:01 2015 UTC,What happened to SUPER HOT? I haven't seen anything on it in ages.
freegames,32avb3,319223149,2,Sun Apr 12 07:49:52 2015 UTC,Their Kickstarter page seems to have monthly updates.
freegames,32avb3,sseemayer,2,Sun Apr 12 09:12:29 2015 UTC,GREAT GAME loved it
freegames,32avb3,0mar92,2,Wed Apr 15 09:30:45 2015 UTC,Really cool game!
freegames,32avb3,596Franky,2,Wed Apr 15 19:42:08 2015 UTC,Hey everyone ! I finally finished working on the update. You can play the new version on the itch.io page : http://albatr.itch.io/superhotline-miami Downloadable versions are still being uploaded and should be available shortly.
freegames,32avb3,Albattr,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:59:34 2015 UTC,Okay... that was bloody awesome. :D

freegames,321c1e,monkeyman764,2,Thu Apr 9 19:59:24 2015 UTC,I fought mediafire for an hour to download the game. I give up.
freegames,321c1e,Shintenpu,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:35:34 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, there are six games, coming in various sizes of 20MB to 300MB, and the wrapper, and porting software takes up about .5 GB itself. Sorry you dont want to spend the time. I tried to compress it, so now it is only 900MB."
freegames,321c1e,Shintenpu,1 point,Fri Apr 10 09:49:46 2015 UTC,I have problems with the hosting site. I really wanted to try them though.
freegames,321c1e,babazon1,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:08:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the site isn't the greatest. Here is a direct link: Mediafire"
freegames,321c1e,babazon1,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:36:21 2015 UTC,so these are Mac games ported to Windows or vice-versa? the title is a little fuzzy.
freegames,31fsmu,TakiSQ,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:52:54 2015 UTC,"Actually not a bad little game. i got it in a bundle or something, and was quite impressed.  This was one of the first Indie games on team, before Greenlight. This developer did some really nice stuff :)"
