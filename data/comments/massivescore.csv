massivescore,2at64c,m1k3y60659,2,Tue Jul 15 23:36:07 2014 UTC,I think Kris should put down the fucking pizza and go for a jog for once in his life - Kris

But actually, I have a few tips that I've learned from my father who lost over 120 pounds over the course of three years   Losing weight takes time. Don't expect it to all magically fall over over a short period of time. Speaking of time, setting a goal by a certain time period is not very wise. Obviously, setting a weight goal is ok, but by a certain time period isn't. If you don't meet the weight goal by the time you alloted you might get discouraged, and might even stop trying to lose weight. You do not have a disease, you were not born ""big boned"",  you chose to eat all of that food. (I know you talked about this in another video and your extremely correct). Food is an addition, and you might find that you can't control yourself around it, just like a drug addiction.  Don't deny yourself food. Alot of people think that if you stop eating bad things, like chips and pizza, then you'll lose weight. You will however, you might ""relpase"" and eat a bunch of junk food and then hate yourself, also destroying any progress made. Instead, if you go out with friends or are hungry or whatever, don't refuse the food, just eat less than you normally would. Don't have a whole pizza, just half of a slice of one. In addition to this, try to eat healthier, which I think you already know how to do (this is actually a really big point to follow.) Work out! Stay active! Blog from your bike! do whatever to exercise! Go to meetings! There are a bunch of meeting and classes you can go to lose weight that are free! My father went to SMART recovery. He liked it because it focused on food being an addicition, and there was not one set in concrete thing you had to do (like overeaters anonymous which had you ADMIT that you had no control over what was happening to you. Then you confessed to god and it was weirdddd). Instead he did what he wanted to do to lose weight and other were there to give him suggestions and input on what he was doing. Smart recovery link here But hey if you like overeaters anonymous then go for it!   So yeah some tips on losing weight. You aren't alone, and if you need anything then send me a PM!  EDIT: The words are spelled more correcter."
