kpopslumberparty,3e1c7h,xs0ne,9,Tue Jul 21 05:02:01 2015 UTC,"I have a mini intro list to get their feet wet. Everything else really depends on their tastes.   Super Junior - Mr. Simple SHINee - Lucifer BIGBANG - Fantastic Baby 2NE1 - IATB f(x) - Electric Shock SNSD - IGAB   I had this one friend who was easy to trap introduce to kpop. She likes campy and fun things, so SHINee was her GROUP. Then I figured she'd appreciate 2NE1 more, and then she said she liked how pretty the MVs looked. Then I built some youtube playlists based on other assumptions. Turns out I'm awesome."
kpopslumberparty,3e1c7h,life-finds-a-way,4,Tue Jul 21 06:41:24 2015 UTC,"My list is actually very similar:   SHINee - Lucifer (+ dance practice, it's what got me into kpop)/Dream Girl  (Maybe View as well since that house vibe is huge at the moment) f(x) - Electric Shock B2ST - Breath EXO - Call Me Baby/Growl Big Bang - Tonight SNSD - Gee/Genie Infinite - The Chaser/BTD/Back/Bad (My bias is showing)   If they're into more band sort of stuff, then I'd add CN Blue's I'm A Loner and FT Island's Hello Hello.  NEVER use EXO's Wolf to get someone into kpop. Never fucking ever.  (Edit: It's BREATH GOD DAMMIT)"
kpopslumberparty,3e1c7h,ladymahariel,4,Tue Jul 21 09:14:42 2015 UTC,"Lucifer and Electric Shock seem to always be on lists! They're a good starting point.  That same friend really took to Lucifer, so I showed her Everybody and Sherlock and Dream Girl. Totally hooked. She hates ballads, so no Batoost EVER. She also appreciated VIXX. And then yeah, some good ol' CNBLUE and FT Island."
kpopslumberparty,3e1c7h,life-finds-a-way,5,Tue Jul 21 10:55:38 2015 UTC,"This is why I chose the only Batoost song that had kind of like a dub-vibe, if you get me. That song was so ahead of it's time I'm still amazed.  I actually really liked VIXX's Super Hero as a starting point, but I couldn't get into them after that - but that's just me."

kpopslumberparty,3e1c7h,life-finds-a-way,4,Tue Jul 21 12:01:09 2015 UTC,"I really depends on so many factors. What kind of non-kpop music does the person listen to? Do they care about power house vocals or not? Is top notch dancing a priority? Does the person gravitate towards sexy, cute, dark, eccentric, or a mix of the various concepts out there?   So, I'd recommend VIXX to someone who I thought would be into the more theatrical type performances with big vocals and creative choreography. Also, at least for some of their work, VIXX does the whole dark concept like no other.  SHINee is a blend group, and since they are my UB group, I try and find something to show to anyone interested in kpop. But really, SHINee has a little bit of everything. Dream Girl is kind of eccentric and trippy, Sherlock has some of my favorite choreo in kpop and is a song that just feels somewhat epic, Everybody is a great power jam and the lives of it are some of SHINee's best performances both in terms of vocals and the amount of energy put into the physical side of it. View is great for summer and the laid back vibe. If they want cute then there is always Hello, but that's just not really my cup of tea. I can't wait to see if they really go for a darker concept coming up.   Mamamoo is such a fantastic live group. I'd recommend them in a heartbeat to someone who values live vocals and a more ""down to earth"" approach to performances. Mamamoo doesn't have insane choreo, but what they do have is huge stage presence, and can hook audiences regardless. Also, their music is great for someone who likes a more soulful sound with tracks like Piano Man and Mr. Ambiguous.   SHINee is a group I always show for choreo, but BTS has been added to that list as well. They are just so precise it's hard not to be blown away. I'd definitely go with I Need U or Dope as a starter because those two definitely feel bigger and more complex musically than their previous work, but if the person likes the more straight hip hop sound then their earlier stuff would be the better fit.   4minute is a well rounded group, with a little bit for everyone. They have cute, classy, sexy, fierce, tomboy, and feminine on lock down. And Since Hyuna appeared in PSY's video, it can be a great way to bridge the gap between something that most westerners (and the rest of the world) know and the wider kpop world.   And then there are artists like Lim Kim that I would use to introduce to someone who likes more of the ""indie"" scene with really smooth vocals and that might be turned off by music that sounds too ""mainstream"" or ""manufactured.""  I don't really have too many suggestions for those that love the sickeningly cutesy groups, since I just can't get into those groups. Maybe Apink or Gfriend? Definitely SNSD's Gee.  And for straight up sexy then I'd go with Sistar, Stellar, or something like AOA. And for the boys 2PM springs to mind because, fuck, My House is a wet dream in music form.   I like so much stuff it's hard to pick just a few, and this post was entirely too long."

kpopslumberparty,3e03dm,CandyLemon,5,Mon Jul 20 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"Well I mean... It kinda depends on what you mean by ""survive"". Different combinations could survive in different ways. I'm gonna use SHINee.  Worst case, 2 members are left. Most combinations would be fine... They can all dance well and have stable enough singing, but the resulting duo might go a different direction from the ot5. Jjong and onew would monkey magic their way to fame and fortune. Key and Minho would make a funky duo, and they'd have to completely change what kind of music they make, but it could work. Onew and Minho might make the weakest pairing just because I can't really picture where they would go with that.  Regardless I don't feel like any one member carries the group, it's more about what dynamic the resulting halves have."
kpopslumberparty,3e03dm,ihatedecisions,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:48 2015 UTC,"SHINee is a really well blended group. This is shown especially well in a song like Odd Eye that was written to showcase them all. Some comebacks have shit on some of the members, but generally they all bring something to the table.   I agree about Minho and Onew, but in my brain it would be difficult to pair Onew with just one other member of SHINee and it not be weird. Both Jonghyun and Taemin work great solo, and I have a sneaking suspicion that Onew would/will do well alone. I think Onew would do best paired with a female for a duo. Same with Jonghyun, but he has the added benefit of also doing well paired with a rapper, and he did both of those on his solo debut.   I have nothing against Kai, and Pretty Boy is my favorite from Taemin's solo, but Key would have been so much better in the song. His cadence, tone, and attitude would have brought so much to the overall sound of the track with the added benefit that Key is just as talented as Taemin when it comes to dance. They both have different dance styles, but they could have been blended for a great overall style. I get why Taemin wanted to work with Kai, but it's kind of a missed opportunity.   I really want a Minho and Key duo track. It probably won't ever happen, but I think it could be amazing. Both have polar opposite rap styles. Key is fierce and full of attitude with a much sharper tone, and Minho has a much more sultry and smooth quality to his voice. And with Minho's recent ""blossoming"" when it comes to being a sex god on stage, and Key being as fearless as he is, if given the right material to work with between the two of them they could just destroy a sexy, intense, but somewhat eccentric concept.   SHINee just wouldn't be SHINee though without all of the members. It's going to be a huge bummer when they have to start sending members to the military. I'll support them no matter what combination they end up in because they are all so hardworking and talented, but nothing will top all of them together."

kpopslumberparty,3e03dm,ihatedecisions,3,Tue Jul 21 19:36:02 2015 UTC,"Considering JYPE wanted to make a comeback without Nichkhun after his drunk driving accident and 2PM had to fight tooth and nail NOT to, I highly doubt this would happen. They'd leave the company before they'd let it happen.  That said, I think the 3 most valuable members of 2PM (right now) are Jun.K, Taecyeon, and Junho. But I don't think they'd be able to make a very successful group together, haha."
kpopslumberparty,3e03dm,brianabird,3,Mon Jul 20 23:05:43 2015 UTC,"Well it's a little easier now that Jessica got KICKED (still PJSalt about that), now I can say Taeyeon,  Seohyun, Tiffany and either Yoona or Sunny for the Divine Four. Sunny is a better singer than Yoona but for visual and fame purposes you might as well stick with Yoona, and she isn't so bad that she'd totally sink this stripped down Soshi. Previously I would have obviously said run with Taeyeon, Jessica, Tiffany and Seohyun would even nowadays would be an extremely potent four member group, maybe even the best."

kpopslumberparty,3e03dm,unicornbottle,3,Wed Jul 22 06:02:35 2015 UTC,"I guess Beast could survive with just Yoseob, Junhyung, and Doojoon, but then they would be lacking. Yoseob would handle all the heavy vocal lifting (which he currently shares with Hyunseung), Junhyung would obviously be there to make music and rap, and Doojoon can take the role of visual/variety member/actor/lead vocal. Maybe Junhyung can step up and sing a bit."
kpopslumberparty,3e03dm,youhadmeathelo,3,Tue Jul 21 04:31:34 2015 UTC,"My UB has already been listed, but VIXX pops to mind. Both Hongbin and Hyuk could probably not show up in a comeback and musically VIXX would sound the same. The group dynamic would be different, and their performances would be lacking as a whole, but there is nothing so far that those two do that someone else in the group couldn't do vocally and the music still be the same.   Hopefully they will be able to find their own voices and vocal places within the group soon with future comebacks. I have a feeling there is a lot of talent that we have yet to see from those two that they will grow into. Right now it's the Ken and Leo show with a little N and Ravi rap thrown in. I'm happy Ken is getting a solo debut. Leo needs to be next. I think giving them their own place to shine independently of the others allows the group content to be more evenly distributed and written more with everyone in mind. There isn't as much pressure then to remind everyone the group has a crazy vocal range each time a comeback happens.   Just look at SHINee. Maybe it's just coincidence, but line distribution got a lot better after Taemin and Jonghyun came out with solos. The stage dynamics are definitely a lot different. Jonghyun has a place to go crazy with his vocals, and Taemin gets to take center stage with his choreography. Minho definitely became a stand out dancer once the choreo didn't put Taemin front and center half of the time, and Onew and Key (as well as Minho) are much better able to shine vocally now. Ironically, their best group song, Odd Eye, was both written and composed by Jonghyun, so it just goes to show that even the members believe there should be more thought put into the group as a whole."
kpopslumberparty,3e03dm,herere,2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:18 2015 UTC,BTS could survive as a quadruple-threat J-Hope solo. If it has to be half I'd add Jimin and Jin. I might add Jungkook instead of Jimin if they went for a mature concept.

It was a short encounter, Gary was really cool. Really wished Gil wouldve talked to us more, it was mostly Gary.   When Infinite were here I told my friend to come see them before they leave. They interacted with us and my friend got to take a selfie with them. I was really happy for her.   I talked with Sohee from Wondergirls about 6 years ago at the JYP building for one of their christmas events. We stood in line to take pictures with them. I was so happy when we talked. She was so cute! Ahhhh  Met CL a couple of times. She was really happy to see fans waiting for her on one of her visits. Met and talked to Sandy. I regret not confessing my love to her even though I did give her a rose .  My friends and I bumped into Siwon when he was here for an event. Only got autographs since he was in a hurry.   Didnt meet Dal Shabet personally but when they came for a concert 3 years ago, they gave a lot of fan service. It was almost like we were friends lol .  If I remember correctly for smtown, my friends and I saw amber on a city tour bus and my friends were talking to her. Thats the closest we've been to Amber lol.  Korean celebrities: yoo ah in, lee je hoon and shin se kyung when they were filming their kdrama here.  Met Noh Hong Chul when he was here filming for Infinity Challenge with Psy.   Met Yoo Jae Suk, Haha and Noh Hong Chul again when Infinity Challenge came back to film the new years eve episode. HaHa was soooo shocked that there were people there to see them. He had a speechless facial expression. Noh Hong Chul recognized us from earlier and Yoo Jae Suk was amazing."

kpopslumberparty,3ds1u9,lennyfromfrance,2,Mon Jul 20 21:12:24 2015 UTC,I live in NY! haha   My friends and I are just lucky to have met a lot of celebrities. Those I listed are the only ones we interacted with. There are a lot more that came to NYC that we briefly saw.  I kinda grew out of kpop about 2 years ago.

I guess I thought it was too over the top or too pop-y (iknowrite what does that mean that's the whole point)?  Maybe around 2013 I gave their old stuff another look and listen. And I appreciated what it was and really got into all their songs. Because it was super pop-y. Like kpop *NSYNC. (And, no, I do not consider EXO as the *NYSNC equivalent) But other times it's something different.  Now they're my 3rd favorite boy band group (which means a lot) and there's no turning back!!

Mainly just because of Namjoon and his antics, I refused to listen to any of their music but then I came across Dope/their latest mini album and couldn't resist anymore. It was too good then I downloaded the rest of their discography and I was truly blown away."
kpopslumberparty,3drgco,fatoldsun_,5,Sun Jul 19 00:51:15 2015 UTC,"Saaaaame. I still find it difficult to watch their earlier stuff cause the hep hap thing is kinda cringy sometimes, but damn if dope aint great. Their whole discography is great. I love it. And their bombs are funny af."

Now I even like Boy in Luv, ha."
kpopslumberparty,3drgco,dinosinthedust,3,Sun Jul 19 22:07:47 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about BTS! They received so much hype that I was worried they were overrated.

kpopslumberparty,3drgco,sprittany,4,Sun Jul 19 05:26:25 2015 UTC,"I've told this before but VIXX. I first heard of them around Voodoo Doll time and watched the MV since I saw a lot of people talking about it. It made me really uncomfortable (I'm weak), so I just avoided them until earlier this year when I decided to check them out through Big Byung lol. I found them really hilarious and gave their songs a listen and fell in love. Also Leo caught my attention...   Now they're my bias group ><"
kpopslumberparty,3drgco,birdieee,4,Sun Jul 19 00:55:16 2015 UTC,"BTS as well! I just didn't notice them to be honest because all my love went towards EXO. After the Tao fiasco I just felt like exploring more and found I Need U, and absolutely fell in love with their songs. Holy crap, I haven't found a BTS song I didn't like, everything is amazing and the songwriting/production they do is brilliant. I still love EXO but I think my musical taste leans more towards BTS. I'll be headed to TRB later this week too!  The fans, on the other hand.. uhhh. EXO-L part 2? I had no idea how intense some American fans could be until I found some TRB facebook groups. Some fans have tickets to all four shows in NYC, Dallas, Chicago and LA. Some of them seem younger than me and I have no idea where all that money came from."
kpopslumberparty,3drgco,HallyuNoona,3,Sun Jul 19 13:28:18 2015 UTC,For me it's almost all the boybands that I now listen to.  I got into Kpop via girlgroups (and not the cutsey ones) and was very determined my interest would stop there...but dammit if I'm not here a few years later having added boybands to the roster!
kpopslumberparty,3drgco,Equilibriumx,3,Sat Jul 18 19:14:43 2015 UTC,For me it was exactly the other way around haha
kpopslumberparty,3drgco,jyjfromdbskyoona,2,Sat Jul 18 21:51:59 2015 UTC,"Lol. The same. I got into KPop cause of the girl group and thought they boy bands were too Justin Bieber/One Direction-ish, basically for crazy, fan girls. Then I met BigBang, Epik High, and now I just don't judge.  But damn if I'm going to listen to KPop bands. I must draw a line somewhere! xD"
kpopslumberparty,3drgco,SamuelFTW,3,Sat Jul 18 19:28:40 2015 UTC,"TVXQ. I first saw them in white suits and sleezy dress shoes singing boring balads in Japan. Sure someone may like that but it's just not my thing.  But then I heard their a capella and live performance of songs like Bolero, Why did I Fall in Love With You, You're My Melody and I was shocked at their amazing voices and harmony.  And then I got to know their personalities and realized that they weren't divas full of themselves but lonely dorky cuddly losers. And I mean that in a best way possible."
kpopslumberparty,3drgco,RedBeluga,3,Sat Jul 18 19:46:12 2015 UTC,Crayon Pop took me a while to get into. Just a bit of a different group compared to others but I really like them now! c:
kpopslumberparty,3drgco,Enter_Text_Here,3,Sat Jul 18 19:50:36 2015 UTC,"The biggest one for me was BEAST, i refused to listen to them for a good year and a half (except for fiction) and then i fell in love with all their title tracks, they are so good! I originally thought beast wasnt that great for some reason and most their title tracks were boring, but i have definitley have been proven wrong; they are top 3 for me now :) Also for me i refused to like sexy girl group concepts but then when EXID up and down got really popular i started to really love them; AOA, SISTAR and EXID are in my top 5 favourite groups now :)"
kpopslumberparty,3drgco,BillyDuong,2,Sat Jul 18 23:25:46 2015 UTC,"I've said this in other threads before, but AOA for me. I didn't really become a fan of them until they ditched the whole band concept. Also it helped that I saw SeolHyun in a drama and researched her and found that she was in AOA."
kpopslumberparty,3drgco,jjaebum,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:34:02 2015 UTC,Red velvet. I thought they were boring and their first single was downright awful. But i listened to their mini album and it was really good. Heard them sing live and i was impressed. Now they're probably my second favourite after snsd.
kpopslumberparty,3drgco,citrinous,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:04:12 2015 UTC,"Infinite, MYNAME, and 2PM to name a few. I always thought Infinite was just just a bunch of good looking assholes who made boring music. After they came out with Last Romeo and Back, I started to like their music (I LOVE those 2 songs and I started to not mind their older stuff). I watched some of the shows they did and thought they were really funny (and even more gorgeous than I originally thought coughmyungsoocough) and I find their humor to be more funny than assholish. Mainly, I love them now.    With MYNAME I didn't really like Baby I'm Sorry or Hello & Goodbye. Plus there was one episode of MTV diary with a few groups I liked and them, and I thought Seyong was really annoying (sorry Seyong I don't think that anymore!) But then I saw the MV for Baby I'm Sorry and loved it so much and thought they were adorable so I started listening to their other stuff and really liked it, especially their Japanese stuff (which is amazing since I normally hate it when kpop artists do Japanese music). And I watched some shows they were on and thought they were hilarious so now I love them.    For 2PM, I just thought they weren't special at all and they were outdated. I actually didn't even know they had more recent music. I think literally the only song I knew was Heartbeat. I didn't realize ADTOY was also their, but it didn't matter because I don't like that either. I didn't start to like them until probably a month before Go Crazy. I heard Jun.K's korean version of No Love and loved it. And I also liked Junho's korean versions of his Japanese stuff. I say some videos with them and since they were in the same company as GOT7 I was seeing a lot of them. And then they announced Go Crazy so I was pumped. It ended up being pretty much my favorite song ever so that sealed the deal. I also discovered a lot of other songs by them that I love so yeah, I totally misjudged them."

kpopslumberparty,3do7rh,life-finds-a-way,5,Tue Jul 21 02:32:44 2015 UTC,"Y'all gon' get a lot from me.    Soloist in the true sense (debuted as such):   Mr. Se7en.  His music is smooth R&B at the core, but he did some other things. He was always so cool! And I really like his singing voice. He was old school YG, and was one of the OG moneymakers. He was also a great mentor to the YG kids at the time. thanks for giving TOP his nickname  Some of y'all know how much I love TOP, right? Se7en is the bias TOP can't find out about.  Some tracks:   Passion La La La I'm Going Crazy Digital Bounce Better Together Somebody Else   I also like:   Lee Hi   HAYI! <3<3<3 Tremendous voice. I can't wait to hear more from her!  Crush   CRUUUUUUUSH! Always a laid-back vive. Nice to listen to and low-key jam.  Bumkey   Whether it's solo or a feature, I get down.  Zion.T   I group him with the two above. Unique voice. I'm a fan of the sound.   John Park   His single ""U"" was a step in a darker direction. I freaking love it!  Parc Jae-jung   Such a great voice. I really enjoyed his Annie cover on Superstar K5. His promotional single ""At First Sight"" is also great; it was given a darker re-imagining as ""Stalker"".  Ailee.    Y'all know Ailee. I love her voice. And her.      Soloist but is part of a group:   Lee Hyori   This is all I really need to offer.    I also like:   Daesung   NOT THAT I GET TO HEAR HIM IN KOREAN OFTEN YG WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU I KNOW I'M SHOUTING THIS NEEDS TO BE HEARD GIVE HIM AN ALBUM. He has a somewhat unique vocal color (Onew and KSY have similar sounds). It's warm and strong but light when it needs to be. Wings. Freaking Wings. Every time.  Seungri   I could listen to him sing all the time. His mini album might not be innovative, but it's the music he wants to make and I think he kicks ass!"

kpopslumberparty,3do7rh,majekmistake,2,Sat Jul 18 03:06:27 2015 UTC,"Well, he's one of my favorite people in kpop and he's a soloist now so I'll take this opportunity to gush. Ladies and gents, I give you the the amazing Park Jeesu aka KIXS  I'll start with his only official solo track so far, Beautiful (비율 A+)(Feat. San E). The song was written by Jeesu and co-composed by Jeesu and Double Sidekick. The song is lighthearted and playful, which are the perfect words to descibe Jeesu himself. I've been a fan of his since his Dalmatian days and he's always been a ball of sunshine. This live performance of Beautiful is my favorite live ever because of how much fun he looks like he's having on stage. I think it's really really nice to see artists genuinely enjoying performing.  Now I'll talk about his voice. Jeesu has the best falsetto in the business. I will accept no opinions contrary to this fact. Before becoming an idol he used to record guide vocals and he said that a lot of people in the industry would think he was a girl before meeting him because his guide vocals were so high. When he was in Dalmatian/DMTN the other members used to tease him about it too. Here's a recent recording of him singing Eric Benet's Real Love that really shows off his falsetto well. Also here is him singing IU's famous high notes. (He says that he wants to do a duet with IU because he thinks his high voice and her high voice together would be interesting). Finally, here is Jeesu with the other Dalmatian boys doing Officially Missing You where his voice sounds really beautiful. He's the one in the top hat.  If you're still not in love with him by now here's a video where someone put together snippets of Jeesu singing and snippets of him being charming and fun and playful."

A recent example: SNSD's ""Party"" has them spelling out ""P-A-R-T-Y"". I thought they said ""feeeel oh ji won"".   For Korean --> English lyrics, I always thought CL was saying ""we have bullog jerky every day"""
kpopslumberparty,3diwur,qetuo4756,3,Thu Jul 16 19:11:22 2015 UTC,"In Rubber Soul's song ""Life"" at the vocal part at 2:30, she sings ""If you leave for something"", and it even says that in the subtitles, but I still want to believe that she says ""If you live for something.""

kpopslumberparty,3diwur,Meeil,3,Thu Jul 16 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"I came here for the cat picture, turned out to be a doggy.  The ""English"" in K-pop is often really difficult to understand because the pronunciation and syllable stress on certain words is totally unlike how you'd say it in most English dialects and Koreans like it that way or something. A good example is Jiyoon's rap in Crazy where she says gos-SIP girl. Or Jimin in Puss where she says Napp-po-lay-on instead of Na-POLE-lee-on like many of us say in English (not an English word but whatever).   Tiffany talked about this in an early interview once, how she got reprimanded for using American pronunciation for English words instead of the Korean pronunciation."

kpopslumberparty,3d2w09,keithape,2,Mon Jul 13 17:15:30 2015 UTC,Really? He sounds so nasally. I think Daesung might be better but Taeyang is more utilized for being more iconic/popular.
kpopslumberparty,3d2w09,CandyLemon,2,Tue Jul 14 07:48:48 2015 UTC,Lately I can't decide who the better vocalist is between Daesung and Taeyang. They both sound really really good and they get about the same amount of lines.
kpopslumberparty,3d2w09,jyjfromdbskyoona,12,Wed Jul 15 09:44:10 2015 UTC,JYJ - if you think Jaejoong is the best looking then rock-type singing and song-writing. (Yoochun - acting. Junsu - dancing.)

kpopslumberparty,3d2w09,kotoriko,14,Mon Jul 13 04:22:06 2015 UTC,I'll start things off with my picks:  Female: Mamamoo Solar - Best looking and best vocals  Male: BTS Suga - Best looking and best rapping (Sorry Rapmon ;_;)
kpopslumberparty,3d2w09,FyahCuh,2,Mon Jul 13 02:21:46 2015 UTC,"agree on solar; wheein's pretty good too but solar's voice is more powerful and she's gorgeous. another girl group i think this applies to is AOA. From what I see, people love Choa and she's also the best singer of the bunch."

kpopslumberparty,3d1dzm,hyperforce,16,Sun Jul 12 18:48:49 2015 UTC,"I'm living and working in Korea and I studied linguistics and East Asian languages in college so my reasoning behind learning Korean and my methods are a bit different than the typical foreign fan.  Right now I'm committing pretty hard to it. I pay a lot of money to see a private tutor twice a week. I'm going to language exchange once a week. I'm throwing myself at every Korean who'll talk to me in hopes of making Korean friends to speak with. I do all of the communicating with shopkeepers and waitresses when my friends and I go out. I've only been in Korea for 5 months and I've only been studying for 3, but I think I'm making really good progress. My tutor says she now considers me an intermediate level student now! The problem I'm having though, is that I'm still working on basics. Telling time, making plans, talking about weather, daily routines, etc. I can talk about those things really well and use a lot of complicated grammar with them, but my subjects are limited to those so having real Korean conversations with real Korean people is still not obtainable for me yet. When I tell Koreans that I'm studying Korean really hard they start talking to me using words and verbs that I don't understand and I'm like, ""Do you want to talk about how often you brush your teeth? Because I know all of the words to talk about that.""  My relationship with kpop has actually vastly improved since I started learning Korean. When I understand lyrics on my own without the help of translations I get so excited because it feels like validation for my hard work. The day that I completely understood a song from start to finish by myself was so amazing. The song was High4's Day by Day and I almost cried when I heard it because I was so happy.   I think the lyrics aren't so bad. Some are cheesy and some don't make sense, but it's basically the same as English pop in terms of lyrical content. Studying Korean has cleared up a lot of things about Korean culture for me too, but I mostly see that in my daily life in Korea rather than in kpop fandoms so I don't know how much others will be able to relate to that part.  You should study Korean! I've studied Spanish and Mandarin Chinese in the past but I'm having the most fun with Korean. It's so different from English and learning about all of it's intricacies has been a really great experience for me."
kpopslumberparty,3d1dzm,majekmistake,2,Sun Jul 12 22:01:39 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, is Korean very different from Chinese? I have native fluency in English and Chinese and was thinking of picking up Korean, and I've gotten the hang of hangul, but with regard to vocabulary, grammar etc., is it easy to learn Korean if you already know Chinese?"
kpopslumberparty,3d1dzm,macritchies,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:10:33 2015 UTC,"It's actually not very similar at all, despite some of the vocab being similar. Sometimes i come across Korean words that i'm like ""isn't this just tones away from being the same in Mandarin?"""
kpopslumberparty,3d1dzm,SongMingHan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:12:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've also come across some Korean vocabulary that is really similar to Mandarin. And thank you!"
kpopslumberparty,3d1dzm,macritchies,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:34:26 2015 UTC,"I didn't study Mandarin for very long so I'm not fluent by any means but I agree with /u/SongMingHan, there is some similar vocabulary but the grammar is mostly completely different. Mandarin and English are both SVO (Subject Verb Object) languages and Korean is an SOV (Subject Object Verb) language and where you put your subjects, objects, and verbs influences all of your grammar rules."
kpopslumberparty,3d1dzm,majekmistake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:55:48 2015 UTC,"Quiet frankly, Mandarin does you no good, and i would suggest, if you REALLY wanted to learn a different language before Korean, i'd suggest Japanese, because there are SO many materials on the japanese internet with which to learn korean, and it's literally just particles and vocabulary changes, and some loose grammar rules."
kpopslumberparty,3d1dzm,SongMingHan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, the grammar is probably going to be the tough part for me, partly since Chinese doesn't have tenses. Thanks!"
kpopslumberparty,3d1dzm,macritchies,5,Wed Jul 15 08:35:00 2015 UTC,"I can read Korean fairlyu well, painfully shy about speaking it, upper beginner level of sentence constructing (mostly I just simply don't enough vocab yet)  Learning Korean hasn't affected my ability to enjoy the songs. I knew a lot of the lyrics were stupid before I learned any Korean so it's not like it was a massive unveiling.  It has made reading news stories  and searching for stuff easier though. Mostly I didn't start learning it for Kpop reasons though so it is unsurprising it hasn't affected that aspect much."
kpopslumberparty,3d1dzm,HallyuNoona,3,Sun Jul 12 19:08:27 2015 UTC,"First things first, I can't speak Korean well.  Reading is okay because it's easy to understand.  I'm not very fluent and I'm very self-conscious about speaking it haha  With K-pop, you start understanding lyrics and hearing the same words over and over again and you realize how the lyrical themes are the same all the time. That's about it tbh  and as /u/HallyuNoona said, I too, knew that the lyrics were menial so it really wasn't a ""massive unveiling"", that is very true."

kpopslumberparty,3d1dzm,Equilibriumx,3,Mon Jul 13 01:04:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly!  Those words and just a lot of other words who translate to : you, me, love, hate, can't, feel, want, need etc etc.  I recently started to listen to BTS and BTS' Dope has some lyrics I've never heard before, and of course, they translate to something a bit more meaningful than most lyrics :)"
kpopslumberparty,3d1dzm,heyjae,3,Mon Jul 13 12:19:39 2015 UTC,I just started (about a month ago so I'm still super new to this) learning Korean and I get so excited when I start understanding certain words or phrases throughout the songs I like. I've always looked up translated lyrics so I'm well aware of how silly  some songs can be so I wasn't really surprised by that.  I've always enjoyed learning about foreign cultures and the Korean language is really interesting to learn so that's helping me stay interested in improving. It seems so daunting when you first start but after you get comfortable with the different sounds and grammar rules it can actually be very fun! You should give it a go if you have an interest.
kpopslumberparty,3d1dzm,pathcodejpa,2,Mon Jul 13 00:46:30 2015 UTC,"As with any language I learn, picking up Korean has only benefited me. I taught English in Seoul from 2011-13 and started really self-studying there. I hate to admit but I'm nowhere near fluent, but I can communicate in casual conversations (talking about myself and my work life) and my reading and listening skills have improved vastly since then. Obviously, having as much Korean language skills as possible had really boosted my quality of life in Korea. Just one month after I arrived I did everything I can to be independent and studying Korean was extremely helpful. Speaking it and not feeling embarrassed was a HUGE thing and it still is for me. But everyone was very supportive of my efforts no matter how broken I sounded. Having this knowledge and skill is truly invaluable and really helps me to understand Korean culture (since the language is so deeply connected to it).  Two years after leaving Korea I still casually pick up new things about the language, through k-dramas (which I've only started watching recently!) and Korean music. To be honest I didn't like any k-pop until I became more familiar with Korean and the way it sounds. (I also think k-pop has improved in recent years but that's a whole other story. Please don't hurt me haha.) Plus, I like to sing along to songs (whether in the noraebang or in my car XD)."
kpopslumberparty,3d1dzm,SongMingHan,2,Mon Jul 13 02:05:27 2015 UTC,"You know, i love it, and hate it at the same time. Love it, because it's started to help me expand my mentality, hate it, because there are some english words i can't recall off of the top of my head, example would be ""here"", which really sucks because i work in a store, so i tend to say ""here"" a lot."

kpopslumberparty,3cr30h,chunelle,8,Fri Jul 10 16:13:55 2015 UTC,Kangin is probably more trashy than Shindong. Shindong's an asshole but he's never been arrested for DUIs or assaulting anyone. I hate Kyuhyun too (although at least he actually contributes to Suju musically??) but Kangin is the worst.
kpopslumberparty,3cr30h,_cornflake,13,Fri Jul 10 18:41:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah Shindong is a dipshit, like so many members of SuJu seem to be for whatever reason. I don't know how Shinee ended up with really well-adjusted and conscientious guys while SuJu seem to be a collection of total misfits.   This one back in the day was really bad: https://sookyeong.wordpress.com/2010/01/30/super-junior-shindong-explains-comments-made-on-fat-woman-on-radio-show/  Forget about his lack of musical ability, that nonsense really took the cake."

kpopslumberparty,3cr30h,brianna_rune_,10,Fri Jul 10 21:08:24 2015 UTC,"Well, Jay Park. He sings well and he looks so cute, but if the scandals of 90s R&B stars have taught me anything, looks don't equal personality. For one thing, he comes off way too try-hardy. On SMTM, he seems to be less focused on contestants having actually talent and more on the ""sweg and ghetto"" stuff that makes me feel like he does not really understand Hip-Hop as an art-form. Plus he can sometimes come off as a bit of a fetishist, and while I LOVE it when black girls are in music videos (since compared to other foreigners races we get almost nothing and it's treated as terrible when we are in something), I wish it was someone who had a better understanding off black girls being regular girls, not big butt s-e-x-bots.   Plus, I feel like him and Zico are treated like kings of Korean Hip-Hip for bringing it to the Korean mainstream, even though at times it feels like they don't know that much about Hip-Hop besides how to rap (well, how to rap on Zico's end, Jay Park's rapping sounds like a alternative G-dragon)...  Please don't judge me for this"
kpopslumberparty,3cr30h,_cornflake,4,Fri Jul 10 23:21:06 2015 UTC,"Jay Park's so embarrassing and he's definitely a fetishist. He's not even that good looking imo (not that that would be an issue at all if he didn't generally gross me out of course, but I'm always kind of surprised how many people find him attractive)."
kpopslumberparty,3cr30h,CandyLemon,2,Fri Jul 10 23:34:39 2015 UTC,"No judgement here, and all of the reasons you listed is why I'm not a fan of him anymore. I liked him when he was in 2PM, and still wanted to support him after 2010 happened, but slowly and surely, he revealed himself into someone I couldn't like. Another thing that annoys me is his whole ""Started from the bottom now we're here"" attitude - I'm glad that he's figured everything out after Sidus, but he acts like his idol career had nothing to do with his current success.  Also, his singing voice is so grating to me. All I want in my life is a studio version of 2PM's ""Angel"" without him in it."

kpopslumberparty,3cr30h,unicornbottle,10,Fri Jul 10 06:34:39 2015 UTC,"I go back and forth on all of Big Bang. They are one of those groups I just enjoy the music and visuals from, but just don't follow closely otherwise. I have worked with a lot of artists doing things like filming MVs or concerts, and a lot of people believe their shit really doesn't stink. And these are people all the way from just locally known  to international fame. So I got disillusioned with celebrities pretty quickly.  I think BB just put off this air that reminds me of these kinds of celebrities sometimes, and I just sort of have a gut reaction to it.   But really, until you do actually get to know someone, there is no way to know what they are really like. So I try to keep from judging people too harshly. I have worked with artists that were amazing and down to earth as well, and some of those I had the wrong impression of just from their public personas."
kpopslumberparty,3cr30h,chunelle,3,Fri Jul 10 14:21:13 2015 UTC,"I used to have that vibe from GD, but lately I've felt that he has become more humble. With the rise of k-hiphop and a whole host of very talented rappers and singers, I'm sure GD realizes now that he isn't the best rapper around and is no special snowflake. He's certainly aware of people like Zico, Zion.T, Crush, the AOMG guys, etc. and respects them."
kpopslumberparty,3cr30h,unicornbottle,11,Fri Jul 10 14:27:30 2015 UTC,I think he thinks he's above Korean entertainment specifically in regards to his composing/producing etc.
kpopslumberparty,3cr30h,_cornflake,7,Fri Jul 10 16:07:02 2015 UTC,"Oh lol yeah. I watched some videos of him from 2012 and he totally acted that way. He was one of the few idol producers back then, but in 2015 the kpop game has changed and idol songwriters and composers are very common and encouraged. And we're not talking about people just dabbling in lyrics, but producing chart-toppers and well-received mixtapes. I don't know if he's aware of this or not, because he gives off the vibe that he thinks he's still the only successful idol producer around.   Well, YG himself pushes this whole ""our company is unique and above everyone!!"" and lots of people actually buy that."
kpopslumberparty,3cr30h,_cornflake,9,Fri Jul 10 18:11:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like Zico is much more insufferable at the moment that GD is. Like, at least when GD brags he has the success to back it up? Zico does okay, sure, but GD and Big Bang pretty much changed how kpop worked when they first came out and people call GD the second Seo Taiji? Zico's just... Zico... he's talented but it's not like there aren't plenty of other talented rappers and producers in kpop/k-hiphop."
kpopslumberparty,3cr30h,life-finds-a-way,4,Fri Jul 10 18:38:25 2015 UTC,"I mean, honestly I kind of hate G-Dragon too (partly because I used to be a fan and had to give up after getting disappointed too many times, and partly cos he can just be quite hateable) but I would never say he's given me the vibe he dislikes the other members of Big Bang. If anything I feel like he likes some of them more than they like him? Although all the members seem to be getting on well during the comeback, even the ones who might not have got on so well in the past - in particular it seemed in sort of 2012-2013 that GD and TOP barely spoke to each other, which made me really sad cos I loved their friendship, but they all seem good again now and GD and TOP even cuddled on stage quite recently @_@  He definitely thinks he's above being an idol though, which I think is why he does some of the stupid things he does (like being semi-open about taking drugs even though he could get in serious legal shit for it). Unfortunately he still is an idol so it doesn't work out too well..."

And considering the number of MV they've been filming, the rehearsals and concerts, and the time it takes to film all the performances at music shows before they get to the encore stage, it's not entirely surprising that they might have a schedule overlapping with another at some point."

But now the more I see him the more I'm starting to dislike him... like as I watched him in Hitmaker I started liking him less and then whenever I saw him on ASFU I really started to get annoyed by him and now it's like whenever they announce he's gonna be in something I'm like... ew no

kpopslumberparty,3cr30h,oshuddup,2,Fri Jul 10 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"Park Joon from GOD comes across as a douchebag to me. I get the impression from his overly customized face (or natural weird looking face... I was wrong on such things before) that his behaviour is an overcompensation for his insecurities.   JYP seems kind-hearted, but his ego looks inflated and he grosses me out the way he sexually interacts with much younger dancers and over sexualizes them.   Sehun from EXO seems like he doesn't care about others. He was my first bias, but he slowly nears the bottom as I get to know him better. Also Suho always gives off an insincere (but this might be because he's burdened with the leader position) and ""a dad trying to be cool"" impression. If Sehun would be gone and Chanyeol gets all of his rap lines I think EXO's songs, but especially the live performances would improve.   PO from Block B tries too hard to be cool and cute, while he isn't. It makes me feel awkward fór him by just watching it. Especially from the lyrics he wrote he seems anything but innocent. I really love him on-stage however, so this makes me feel very conflicted. I also don't get why he in ""Zero for Conduct"" disses others for not being cool, while he himself doesn't appear cool off stage at all?"
kpopslumberparty,3cr30h,jeongsinmt,3,Fri Jul 10 23:21:15 2015 UTC,I feel like Sehun is close to a few members and aloof to everyone else. I noticed that sometimes his dancing sucks and is lazy and other times it's on point.  He seems to be a kid who'll sometimes try and sometimes not.   Oh boy Suho ._.   Can't stand him tbh. He tries so hard and for what 7 years of training he honestly isn't great at anything. His variety skills are so cringey -_-

So she keeps what she wants (if each album is signed by only one member, and it's one of her bias groups, she might keep multiple albums so she has a full set of signatures or something... or she might just keep one copy for herself, depending) and then she sells the rest in the dealer's room at anime conventions or online.  And then a lot of the time, if you buy more copies of the album than anyone else, the group will send you some little keepsake... like she's got this neck pillow that every member of the group used (I don't remember which group...), and was sent with polaroids of them all wearing it lol.

I'm not sure if they've been around for a while but I hadn't heard of them until recently and not many views on their mv.   Awesome Baby - Why Should I - they're so nugu they don't have an mv yet but I'm heart eyes emoji at the two with short hair.   And my favourites (who actually have over 600k views on this!

If you're going to make me choose one nugu song to rule all nugu songs, it would definitely be DMTN's Drive. Drive is actually my favorite song even outside of kpop. It's such a chill song with beautiful vocals and a really singable chorus and sweet lyrics. It makes me really sad that DMTN isn't together anymore.  If I had to pick one from a group that's still active it would be Mr.Mr's Do You Feel Me. If you told me you finished listening to this song for the first time and didn't have it stuck in your head for days afterward, I would not believe you. It's ridiculously catchy and smooth.   A few honorable mentions:   F.Cuz - Jiggy - This is the most fun debut in all of kpop. I will accept no opinions to the contrary of this fact. Airplane - How R U? - This song didn't make the top spot because the group disbanded but it is such a good song. I love trios and Airplane was such a good combination of voices. Legend - Left Out - I gush about this song enough around here that I'm sure you've all heard it by now. I think it's a really unique song and all aspects of it are really well done."

Their company and the members never officially released a statement about disbandment but Danny's scandal was over 2 years ago and they haven't put any music out together since then. Also, if you follow the member's social media accounts, it looks like they're all moving on with their lives in different directions. Specifically, Jeesu is already signed with a different agency and has made an official solo debut a couple months ago. Donglim recently released Zombie Zone and Track on his personal YouTube channel and Dari has released his own rap songs, Bbang and Rain Shower. It looks like Inati has been doing modeling work since the split and Daniel and Simon are always posting from Korea and LA respectively but I don't know what kind of work they're into, they just post cute pictures of their dogs and sexy selfies. What completely breaks my heart is that they are all still really close and they show up in each others posts all the time even though they don't seem to be making music together anymore. At Jeesu's first fanmeet as a soloist last year the whole group (minus Danny, plus DayDay!) went to support him and sang some songs with him and they were all posting pictures together and it just about made me cry because it was so sweet.   Thank you for the compliment! Boy group rookies and nugus are totally my jam. It's so nice to see other nugu lovers around here!"

It's a shame they were involved with such an absolutely shitty company and had no choice but to  disband :(  Another one I really liked was Snake by A-JAX. The group isn't all that nugu I think? But their fan base seems pretty small and this song is one of their least popular ones. The rap verse is a bit out of place but I still think the song's great and really catchy.

kpopslumberparty,3cdqut,qetuo4756,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:16:13 2015 UTC,"Would you have preferred that I said ""to ever exist""? Why wouldn't they still hold the record for tallest group that has existed? I don't understand why you're arguing about this when I made the distinction between groups that used to exist and groups that still exist.  There is no clear-cut distinction when a group ""turns into"" a Jpop group. If you have a list of standard requirements, I'd love to see it. I'm not interested in convincing you that they're Kpop because it's obviously subjective, so if you want to consider them a Jpop group, go ahead. But here's why I personally consider them Kpop: 1) they're Korean, 2) they were trained for years in a Korean company, 3) their music sounds heavily like Kpop (a couple of their albums have had a very Jpop sound but their recent stuff sounds and looks clearly like Kpop), 4) most importantly, they are considered Kpop by Japanese media and they advertise as a Kpop group."

I mean of course there's tracks here and there I'm not a fan of, but generally I like most of their songs and like them enough to continue downloading all their albums.  EDIT: to make this more legit I'll recommend some non-title tracks from each of those groups       GOT7 - 그냥 오늘 밤 (Just Tonight) & Moonlight (I pick a couple GOT7 songs and listen to them a lot for a while and then I switch them out for different GOT7 songs haha. These are the two I've been into recently) BTS - 2학년 & Outro: Love is Not Over (BTS' albums are so strong, you can tell they really put a lot of effort into each track.) B.A.P - S.N.S, Coma, & It's All Lies (B.A.P is too close to my heart to not pick 3 songs) B1A4 - 물 한잔 & Oh My God (I really want to commend B1A4 because their recent albums have honestly been SUCH an improvement from their earlier albums) Teen Top - Why, Jealousy, Hot Like Fire, & Shake It (I think they've been around long enough to deserve 4 songs lol. Also the amount of Changjo in Jealousy makes me the happiest person alive) VIXX - Light Up the Darkness & Secret Night Block B - Wanna B & No Joke UNIQ - Luv Again & Listen to Me (Chinese Ver.) (yeah I know Luv Again has an MV but they only have 1 album so there's not much to choose from. Also, yes, it does have to be the chinese version for Listen to Me) Ladies' Code - 안울래 & SuperGirl (Ladies' Code has MVs for most of their songs, so I just recommended the only two that don't aside from intros.) BESTie - I'm So Into You & Pitapat (remix) (the reason I recommended the remix is because I HATED the original song, but I LOVE the remix, which is kind of amazing. So even if you didn't like the original, you should give the remix a chance.) BtoB - Imagine & Star JJCC - Be Good & 니가 떠나간다 (they only have two non-title tracks lol) Royal Pirates - Betting Everything (Acoustic/English Ver.) & You (English Ver.)"

Am I old around here? noonas don't hurt me it's a serious question I live in NY, and I've finished grad school since the last introduction post.  My kpop journey started several years ago with BIGBANG. I love YG artists. I also listen to others. I have my clear favorites, but I do keep up with releases and stuff. Unless I know a particular group or artist isn't for me.   Favorites include: WINNER, SHINee, VIXX, Block B, UNIQ, B1A4, 2NE1, f(x), BEG, 4Minute (as of their most recent release). I also enjoy listening to some rappers: Simon D, Dynamic Duo, Dok2, Beenzino, San E. Soloists: Se7en (even if, still), Ailee, Parc Jae-jung, John Park, Bumkey. The FNC bands: CNBLUE and FT Island. There are more.  I enjoy all types of music. Kpop takes up most of my listening time, but I have room for other things. One of my other loves is Bollywood/Filmi music. I've recently become obsessed (all over again) with '90s jams. House and Vogue-y type things that influenced music at that time. (side note: but then there are different and separate influences I can hear in MIKA's latest album and in BIGBANG's latest release, and I just fall in love with music in general). I love learning about other cultures and people, so I do that through food or dramas (like kdramas) or shows (variety) or movies or learning languages.     If our kpop/music interests line up, I'm always willing to discuss! I might be an intense fanboy at times, but it comes from a place of love and appreciation."

I've been listening to kpop on-and off for like...3 years? 4 years? I can't even remember honestly. All I know is that I accidentally found Hyuna - Bubble Pop by accident on YouTube and that shit got stuck in my head for goddamn forever. That song is a drug I tell you. A drug. Things just progressed from there.  As of right now, I've been pretty into the whole kpop world even more so than in the past as I was usually stuck to only things Shinee/Hyuna/BigBang related, but near the end of last year I got into BTS and the rest is just history.  My favorite groups (of the moment, they always change honestly) are Shinee, EXID, BTS (those dorks), BigBang, VIXX, Girls' Generation/SNSD (I have been adoring them lately omg), and most recently, Infinite.

I'm a 18 guy (97 line represent) and I got into kpop around mid-june last year!   The thing with how i got into kpop kinda surprised me as i already listening to it while not knowing i was (if you know what i mean)! I was listening to ""music-box"" renditions of different songs to help me get to sleep around january of last year and there happened to be one for ""shadow""by f(x)! That rendition was actually one of my faves so i decided to look up what the song was! Once i found it and learned about f(x) through the wikipedia small bio, i generally only listened to that song for the next 3 months...  How i eventually got into kpop was watching s LoL stream (Seraph's stream back when he was on CLG) and i really liked the sound of this song... So I called upon the wisdom of the twitch chat trolls and it was confirmed that it was ""Run Devil Run""! I then went to the r/snsd post for people getting into snsd and i never looked back from there haha! (phew that was long haha)  My favourite groups consist of Apink, GOD, The Ark( the top 3 atm haha), Rain, High4, SNSD, F(x) and more recently AoA and Big Bang! I've got about 1200-ish songs on my phone of which about 1100 are kpop haha but i do quite enjoy a large variety of genres as well as kpop like, Rap, House, Trap, Modern Classical/contemporary piano etc..! I'm more of a person who, if the song is good, i'll give the genre a chance so i'm open to any suggestions haha!  Personally i have quite a few hobbies, i like learning new things (weird hobby hahah) so i tend to know like a few things about this and that but haven't really mastered anything (a jack of all trades, master of none,if you will).

I'm one of /r/kpop and /r/kpopslumberparty's resident noonas at 27 years old.  I used to think that I was past any fangirling stage in my life, but then BTS happened, so I don't even know any more.  I discovered kpop 3 1/2 years ago (January 2012) through 4minute's ""Huh"", but what really hooked me and started me on this whole trip was B.A.P's ""Warrior"".  Having never really cared for pop/r&b/rap/hip-hop before, kpop put a huge library of music I'd never been able to appreciate before in a context that I could enjoy, and that's the real reason that I love it so much.  I actually have a much better appreciation for music I used to hate before, and I credit kpop with slowly leading me towards a place where that was possible.  My favorite groups include B.A.P, BTS, EVOL, VIXX, CMYK, and M.I.B, but I listen to pretty much every group/artist.  My digital Korean music collection is about 75GB and has about 400 different artists, if that gives you an idea.  That goes for non-kpop music as well, though I do have a rather large passion for Celtic folk music in particular.  I play many instruments, and other hobbies include gaming (video, board, and table top), acting (musical theater and opera, mainly), running, and various crafts (chainmail, bleach shirts, cross stitching, re-sorting my physical music collection, re-tagging my digital music collection).

I think, for the first time, though, that Dae's voice is a bit jarring and out of place (at first, the bridge is fine).  I know this'll look like I'm trying to suck up to you, but TOP and Seungri are by far the best part of the song.  Their voices are perfect for it.  I think it would have been even better if they'd left the drums out altogether, though.  The intensity at the beginning is palpable, and the soft guitar picking simply beautiful.  I feel like they could have worked more harmonies and variations to compensate for the lack of bass/drums, and it would have been lovely.  Overall, though, I really like it."

JK, I believe you!  Dae does come in a bit strong. I love the effects they put on him, though. It adds something spicy. I still can't get over that breakdown near the end (Dae-Bae-Ri+TOP). Yet another example of how well this group hands off lines effortlessly. It would seem their experiment or realization with that specific harmony wasn't a fluke.

I started watching parodies because I thought it was so bizarre and funny, right? Haha...ha...oh well Bonamana by SJ and I'm the Best became my jams but it was MBLAQ that hooked me, I liked how good Seungho and G.O sounded live because in my head everyone just lip synced. Then I found Teen Top too and the rest is history...  I listen mostly to boy groups and rarely a girl group shows up, my bias group is definitely Bangtan and other favorites: B.A.P, EXO, GOT7, Lim Kim and Teen Top (even though I didn't like much anything after Missing :/), lately UNIQ and Seventeen are taking over my life. (I'm going to see UNIQ later this month and BTS in August so I'm REALLY excited!!)"
kpopslumberparty,3bz41z,macritchies,3,Fri Jul 3 11:52:53 2015 UTC,"Hello I'm Dave! Ontario, Canada. I came across Kpop by accident, I had this Kpop mix I listened to on repeat for the longest time back in 2012 and I had no clue that this was a genre of music lol. I wasn't until i got curious about who the artists were in that playlist that I started to fall in love with Kpop. (4minute, Miss A, T-ARA, f(x) and Apink)  I can honestly say my love is growing for Kpop everyday since i came across Laboum, Park boram and UNIQ. UNIQ really changed things for me because I was always really hesistant about boy groups but I was soo wrong all this time!  Well Nice to meet everyone! :D (im 24 btw)"
kpopslumberparty,3bz41z,BrigidAndair,3,Fri Jul 3 13:39:43 2015 UTC,"Well, quite late, but here goes. '97, Tyler, female.   I only got into kpop very recently, less than 6 months. I've always seen kpop as something I didn't want to get into because people were in way too deep, and the idols aren't what I would consider musicians. Musically, I've always been into more alternative, indie stuff, though in a wide range of genres: Arctic Monkeys, Alt-J, Passion Pit, Tallest Man on Earth, Chet Faker, Local Natives, Geographer + others.   But then I got into anime/manga, and I learned to accept that stanning something is okay. Somehow, I stumbled upon EXO and then BTS and the rest is history. Most kpop idols aren't musicians, they're performers, and I'm okay with that; if they do make their own music, it's a huge plus, e.g. BTS, even Akdong (though I don't think they're really idols?).  I still have trouble getting into girl groups though. The songs sound similar, as do the vocalists, mostly sopranos and higher-pitched voices. I prefer altos (Adele, Lorde) and baritones/basses (Alex Turner, or V's kind of timbre/voice), which you don't tend to hear a lot in pop music. I mean, personality is great and all, but I want to enjoy your music to fully convince myself to fork out time and money to properly stan your group too.   This also goes for a lot of other boy groups; I tried getting into BAP, VIXX, but I couldn't. EXO's newest album was what got me into them (very different from most releases in kpop, I found) and even that soon faded. Currently hooked onto BTS' discography because hip hop is always fun, and their songs are refreshingly different. And the boys are total dorks.   So right now, I'm impressed with/keeping my eye on (criteria being good music, performances etc.): BTS, EXO, Seventeen, B1A4, GOT7, HOTSHOT, UNIQ, Mamamoo, Playback, EXID, Big Bang, SHINee. I'd love any more suggestions, especially to groups that do more non-mainstream sounding music (always fun!), even non-kpop.  And I'm a bit of a nerd for overanalysing things. I find the whole kpop culture very interesting, from the idol worship to sasaengs to hallyu wave to shipping to the notion of real person fiction, form a psychological and sociological perspective. It's also gotten me to start learning Korean, which I've always wanted to anyway; gave up on Japanese once I learned hiragana and katakana, since I can't be bothered to memorise 20 readings for each kanji."
kpopslumberparty,3bz41z,life-finds-a-way,0,Fri Jul 3 19:24:28 2015 UTC,"Most kpop idols aren't musicians, they're performers   I'd contest that. It might go for those who hardly contribute vocally (like some dancers/visuals), but the voice is every bit as much of an instrument, and requires just as much practice, care, and attention as any other. People forget that because a voice is something that almost everyone is born with. For sure, they're performers as well, but a good deal of idols have a lot more training vocally than a lot of independent performers. The distinction that they don't write their own music is a red herring. There are a lot of very talented singers that just aren't able to write their own music, just as there are a ton of songwriters who are incapable of (or just don't want to) performing their creations. That doesn't mean that either is lesser than the other, or that they deserve to follow their passion any less than someone who does both.  I'm not attacking you at all here, but I wanted to voice my opinion on the matter. I'm on mobile, so linking is difficult, but I'd suggest looking up M.I.B's music. They're a non-kpop rap group, and they are fabulous. Try starting with ""Dash(Men in Black)"" or ""Chisa Bounce""!"

That wasn't what I was trying to say, sorry if I came across that way! For me, at least, I regard a musician as someone who creates their own music and performs it; a performer can be just as hardworking and talented as a musician, but if they don't create their own music, they're not technically musicians to me. The labels don't really affect how I view them though, they're just arbitrary categories.   And yeah, I do agree that a lot of skilled vocalists don't have songwriting skills that match up, and a lot of composers can't perform. It doesn't make them any less superior/important and I'm still able to enjoy the music just the same.   Thanks, I'll check out M.I.B soon! It's 4am here and I should probably be asleep..."
kpopslumberparty,3bz41z,macritchies,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"Ah. It's just a touchy subject, because to a lot of people, it does mean that they're lesser. I'd still argue that a performer creates by taking the material and making it their own, and that very few people would argue that, say, a virtuoso piano player that doesn’t write their own music isn't a musician, but I see where you're coming from. The way that I define the distinction is that someone who writes music is a composer, someone who performs music is a musician, and someone who does both is both. I'd define a performer as someone who puts themselves on display for the entertainment of others, but I think at this point we're just arguing semantics. :)  Sleep well!"

I know a tiny bit of Spanish because I have a Guatemalan ""sister"" (She was an exchange student that stayed with us, and we got really close.)  Japanese has been my favorite so far that I've studied. I just really need to pick it back up. My last few semesters in college slammed me with so much work (film majors have no life outside of film) that I just didn't have the time to devote to language as much as I would have liked.  I also grazed the surface of both Russian and Korean as well. I actually dug my Korean textbook back out the other day. I've never seriously studied them, but I really like Dutch, Swedish, and Icelandic.   Languages are a lot more than just memorizing words and learning grammar to me though. I love learning how much languages influence culture and vice versa. The way we think is even influenced by our native language. Some words and concepts are difficult to translate clearly from one language to another, and that's all really fascinating."

But yeah, language really reflects the culture of a certain society - except for English, I'd argue, since it's become so widely used and adapted that you can't really tell what culture 'English' really belongs to - and even as someone with native fluency in two languages, translation's tough. Like, I don't think in English and translate it to Chinese, because it just doesn't work that way very well.   I feel you. Language learning's really fun but it's a time-consuming investment even if it's really rewarding. If you ever pick up Chinese I'd love to help. :)"

kpopslumberparty,3bwwqu,dankyhashpants,3,Thu Jul 2 20:42:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a third year vocal performance major, and I also play piano, cello, ukulele, alto and soprano recorders, Irish tin whistle, and bodhran (an Irish goat skin drum).  Instruments that I own and can play a little of (but am not proficient in) are acoustic guitar, mandolin, 6-string banjo, ocarina, and cornet.  For a short time years ago, I had an electric organ and was taking lessons, but I had to give it away when I moved.  Next instrument on my buy list is a shawm(skip to 0:21 for an idea of what they sound like!).  I am a singer and bodhran player in a Celtic folk band, and we play at local events and renaissance faires.  I also do musical theater and opera with local companies.  As far as brands:   I don't have an actual piano (no room in my living space), but I have a full 88 key Yamaha DGX-640 electric piano with weighted, touch-sensitive keys and a full pedal rig.   My cello was handmade by a local luthier, and is made of maple with ebony pegs and fingerboard.  It's not a professional quality instrument, but it's what I can afford, and it sound fine. My bodhran is a custom job I commissioned, with a 15in goat skin head, and is unusual in that it is very deep (8in), and has no crossbars on the back (most you'll see look like this, mine looks more like this).  It also has hand tuners in it to adjust the tension in the head.  Usually, bodhrans have either tuners that have to be turned with a wrench or none at all.  This comes in very handy if I'm in a humid environment, as goat skin expands in humidity.  I also own a synthetic head bodhran for weather emergencies. My ukulele is a baritone uke, and is a pretty cheap one.  The brand is Kala. My recorders are both Yamaha 300 series simulated rosewood recorders.  Again on the cheap side, but they sound fairly nice.  My tin whistle is Clarke Sweetone in D, with some minor tweaking done to improve intonation. My mandolin is an acoustic/electric Ibanez M510E-DVS. My banjo is a Dean Backwoods six-string.  I like to tune it like a guitar, but with the top three strings down an octave.  Makes a good, rich background instrument. The cornet is a 1943 King Master Model that I picked up at a consignment store for $30.  It's beaten up, but works fine, and I have a friend currently giving me lessons about once a month. The ocarina was a gift from last Christmas, and is a Legend of Zelda ocarina.  It is made of plastic, and came with a song sheet for all the Zelda ocarina songs.  It is awesome. My guitar is currently living at my parents' place, so I can't check brand.  It was also a gift, but I know it's a beginner model.   As for what kinds of things I like playing, really, it's anything.  Strangely enough, I haven't learned any k-pop songs on any instrument, but I have a few memorized vocally.  I sing everything from opera to pop, and I'm pretty good at rapping.  I love music and instruments, so I love it whenever I have the opportunity to even dabble with one.  :)"
kpopslumberparty,3bwwqu,BrigidAndair,2,Fri Jul 3 02:15:47 2015 UTC,"Irish(and Celtic in general) folk is pretty damn cool, so it's really nice to meet people who play folk instruments.  I wish my ocarina was a Legend of Zelda ocarina. Mine's just shaped like a frog mouth or something."

kpopslumberparty,3bwwqu,Monkeysheep,2,Sat Jul 4 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"*note: I play guitar, tuba, bass guitar, piano, trombone, double bass, programming, melodica, ocarina, recorder, ukulele, violin, drums/percussion, koto, and steel pan.   My guitar's a custom Jaguar, my bass guitar's a Jazz Bass, I have a Knabe & Co. baby grand as well as a Yamaha PSR-225GM keyboard synth, a superbone, a Numark CDJ, a Maschine Mikro, some clay ocarina from Seattle, a uke that I got at some Hawaiian souvenir shop, some shitty student violin, and Pearl Drums.  Whilst playing guitar, I mainly use Esus2 modal because it's easier to play rhythm guitar for me because of my delayed(to say the least) fine motor skills, but I also dabble in certain open tunings, or when I'm feeling like a year-beating week, trivial tunings. As for the others, I just play in standard tuning(BBb for brass)  The most fire chord, IMO at least, is probably any slashed chord. It just sounds really nice and cool to me for some reason.  I play different kinds of things, but my favorite genre to play is either dream pop or shoegaze.   Some of my favorite guitar songs to play include Top Secret by SNSD(http://youtu.be/GIX3wt0vo8U), Only Heather(http://youtu.be/fD8Reb-zHXA)(especially the rhythm part because it sounds so pleasant), Only Shallow(http://youtu.be/dlC5CvDbS4A), Oxygen(http://youtu.be/1jSdTBGhDSg)(this song's also great to play on bass guitar), and Pints Of Guinness Make You Strong(http://youtu.be/0wkZGMktFCw).  Some of my favorite bass guitar songs include the aforementioned Only Heather, Only Shallow, and Oxygen, as well as True Faith(http://youtu.be/zzeNAUOp17c), Born Under Punches(http://youtu.be/Y8xdsZhfrcA)(both bass parts, but I enjoy playing the slap and pop part more), and Damaged Goods(http://youtu.be/byCqOvRMOvo)  And in terms of singing, I'd like to think I'm decent. I think my rapping might be better. Maybe it's because I'm black or something."
kpopslumberparty,3bwwqu,brianabird,2,Thu Jul 2 20:57:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a vocalist and drummer. I started with music when I was around 10 years old and played the saxophone. Around the age of 12, I started getting into rock music and ended up being in bands as a lead vocalist, all the way up until I graduated high school. With this transition, I ultimately ended up dropping the saxophone around the age of 15. I played drums on the side, but never for a band of mine. However, I had to sell my drum set after graduating in order to get some extra cash for college. Now, going in to my third year in college, I lost a lot of free time to really practice and only do singing once a month, if I'm lucky. With the time I have this summer, I hope to start doing a lot of K-Pop vocal covers since I rarely listen to music outside of K-Pop now. I took a year worth of classes in Korean at my college during my freshman year, so hopefully I can use that to my advantage."

I can play all of them from sitar to violin, and guitar to harp. I stopped after my 2nd year because i didnt like the attitude of the avarage person who goes to the conservatory. They all have the mindset that they are the best at what they're doing, which is kind of needed if you want to do well is music but still. And at the same time i got really into art, which resulted in my doing art school now.  Right now i only have my custom designed gibson explorer for guitar and a black and white musicman bass guitar.  As for pickups and tuners n shit. I never really used many. See a cello with a wahwah-peddle dont really match. Also guitar and bassguitar are the only two stringed instrument that are known to be electrical. The kept the rest as pure as it is, especially for exotic instruments. Who have an unique sound were shouldnt be fiddled with (i do have an hatsune miku paddle for my guitar which is hilarious)  Chords? A full gain G flat powerchord.   I dont play as mich as i used.

It's strange....  mid-2013-2014 ""Duets"": I remember reading that duets were going to be the end of groups.  2012 ""The misbehaving year"": GD's Crayon, Gangnam Style, Block B's Nilili Mambo, Hyuna's Ice Cream, Ulala Session's Beautiful Night.  Everyone wanted to cause trouble and have a good time.  2010 ""Industrial"": A weird thing where everyone wore all black, learned to love machines, and appeared to perform in the inner recesses of the city (sometimes aided with Auto-tune).  SNSD's Run Devil Run, Beast's Shock, 4minute's I Me My Mine, Narsha's Bribribaba, Taeyang's I'll Be there, Kara's Lupin.

kpopslumberparty,3bag32,Equilibriumx,2,Sat Jun 27 09:11:21 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the beautiful world of BTS!   My favourite Bangtan song is Let Me Know, and I would also recommend Danger, Cypher Pt. 3, and 흥탄소년단/Boyz With Fun. I feel like those four songs give you a pretty good idea of the scope of their music.  You like good choreo? Definitely watch their Gayo Daejejeon Intro Performance Trailer and their Boy In Luv dance practice.  Since you like Rap Monster, it's definitely worth checking out his mixtape. 버려/Throw Away is my personal favourite song on the mixtape.  Since you like the lyrics from Dope, you should check out some of their earlier songs! BTS tend to sing and rap about things other than relationships (although they do have songs about love and relationships too, which is totally cool). In fact, they never used the word ""love"" in a song until their most recent mini-album! Check out N.O and No More Dream.  I hope that tides you over until SHINee's repackage! :P"
kpopslumberparty,3bag32,followthesound,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:41:31 2015 UTC,"I hope that tides you over until SHINee's repackage! :P   haha  Thank you very much, all of these songs seem to be good :)"
kpopslumberparty,3bag32,jjaebum,2,Sat Jun 27 09:48:14 2015 UTC,"The thing I love most about BTS is... their albums are always perfection (ok well theres a lot of things I love about BTS but this is important right now). Their album tracks are just as good as their title tracks, so definitely don't limit yourself to just those.  Their newest album is my favorite so far. I Need U is probably my favorite song by them right now. It's more electronic than their usual stuff but despite what a lot of people say about it deviating from their original style, it very much keeps that BTS feel. Hold Me Tight is a fan favorite off their newest album. It's a bit of a slower song. My favorite off this album (aside from I Need U) is Outro: Love is Not Over. Being an outro, it is shorter than a typical song which is unfortunate, but it's still good. It has a similar style to Hold Me Tight. 흥탄소년단 and Converse High (which they changed to Lovers High for music shows) both have performances that you can watch so you can see the choreo (sorry if I didn't choose the best performances, I'm on my phone so I just chose the first ones that popped up on youtube).   Other than just their newest album, they have plenty of other great songs and choreo. My favorite song for choreo is War of Hormone (its a kickass song too). My favorite performances are their Rise of Bangtan performances. Just One Day is a song that I hated with a passion at first and thought the dance was the dumbest thing in the world. Now I love everything about it. I'm addicted to it and no matter how many hundreds of times I listen to it I never get tired of it. If you want more for choreo and darker concepts, check out Danger and their concept trailer for their O!RUL8,2 album.  I'd give you more but I didn't realize this was making me late for work haha good luck!"

I think Super Junior have a lot of offer in terms of being strong individual celebrities. They've got so many members who do well in variety and solo projects that I can understand why they're such a powerhouse as a group. I thought Eunji was really good as an actress in Reply 1997. I'm sure if girl groups were my thing I would like APink. The members of Beast are very talented and handsome. I've even liked a couple songs of theirs, but I've never been able to fall for them as much as I usually fall for other boy groups."

I picked him out as my favorite after my first listen and then afterward I poked around the internet and found out that he produces and writes most of their music and that he's from Busan (I live in Busan) and that he's adorably short (5'4"") and then I was completely sold at that point."
kpopslumberparty,3b9nw0,majekmistake,2,Sun Jun 28 14:50:04 2015 UTC,I think 2PM is hilarious on variety shows and it's awesome how they can appeal to a bigger audience (since two of their members are almost close to/are fluent in English ie.

Oh well, maybe it was all part of the plan. I mean, they say the winners of SIXTEEN wil debut in TWICE and the remaining girls will debut in a group later. But they can't just put all the ""best"" trainees in TWICE and the ones who aren't as a good in a separate group. You gotta balance it out. It would be dumb to have one crappy group and one great group (not to say that the other girls suck but you get what I mean, right). Still, I was rooting for Momo, so I'm really disappointed she won't be debuting soon. I'll have to see how everything plays out though."
kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,Glensather,12,Thu Jun 25 13:51:25 2015 UTC,I'm wondering what I'll do once all the current groups start disbanding... I'm 25 already and I'd feel a bit creepy stanning for groups of teenagers :/
kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,_cornflake,8,Thu Jun 25 17:13:15 2015 UTC,"I draw the line at '93-liners. Younger than that, and you're only about the music to me, not the rest of the idol/fangirl package. (Granted, that's how I feel about nearly all groups anyway, regardless of age, just because when I stan, I stan HARD, so I can only juggle but so many.)"
kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,gimmemoresalad,2,Thu Jun 25 17:46:56 2015 UTC,I'm have the same mentality but for me I draw the line at around '96. It's really weird knowing there will be idols that were born in the 2000s very soon...
kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,ravingphanatic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:52:53 2015 UTC,"Well, for one, I'm '88-line myself, and my youngest brother was born in '93, so I had a hard time with '93 for a while lol. But honestly 99% of my kpop love is entirely devoted to Block B, and their maknae is a '93-liner, which is part of it. The other two groups that share the remaining 1% of my stanning energy are Big Bang and VIXX... Ravi's my VIXX bias and he's '93-line, and Big Bang is, well, my age. My birthday is smack between TOP and GD."

kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,_cornflake,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:38:04 2015 UTC,"The only problem with that, Is that it's so hard to tell. And I don't really put the effort into a group unless i've already decided to invest myself.  It's a vicious cycle"
kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,Ephriel,8,Fri Jun 26 03:12:22 2015 UTC,"Haven't people been saying this since ten years ago, when Gen-2 was first getting started?    In a few years we'll see reunion activities like the ones G.o.D and Shinhwa are doing lately, except it'll be SHINee and B2ST."
kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,amiaheroyet,4,Thu Jun 25 17:07:49 2015 UTC,"more than a few years.. it was G.O.D's 15th anniversary and Shinhwa's 14th anniversary when they each had their reunions after military, so it would probably be 7 years for Shinee and 8 years for beast. If all members go into military at the same time you can shave off two years"
kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,saramdapgae,6,Thu Jun 25 20:43:14 2015 UTC,"I think we're just breaking out of the transition. The groups that will stick after 2012 (initially) or so have stuck and are growing in popularity. That marks the beginning of the 3rd generation for me.  I feel like it's a natural progression, though. The idols are growing up. And so are their fans. Not that this is a waste of time or life, but there comes a point where a fan can't give as much energy anymore. Maybe it's because nobody else interests them, or because there are more obligations and responsibilities in life that happen.    I have noticed that while the 3rd-gen groups have lots of fans and are the new ""it"" things, people get mad when you compare them to anyone before them. Popularity doesn't trump public love."
kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,life-finds-a-way,2,Fri Jun 26 00:50:55 2015 UTC,"I had this weird thought the other day. When k-pop idols get older, get married and have children will their children follow in their footsteps? And if they do, will they have to go through a rigorous training program or get special treatment? I thought about this while watching Tablo in the recording studio with Haru. lol."
kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,jsalad,3,Thu Jun 25 21:20:56 2015 UTC,"I think about something similar when watching MVs, Which is ""I wonder what their kids will think when they find these videos in 20 years."""
kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,Ephriel,2,Fri Jun 26 03:14:42 2015 UTC,I think it's way too saturated at the moment. New groups debuting all go for the same cute concepts since it's been proven to be successful in the past and they're all trying to jump on the Hallyu bandwagon. I've not liked any rookie groups that debuted in the last 12 months at all. It was just the same concept one after the other.

Although there are many, many, many, many generic promotions, there's been a lot of really interesting ideas from music videos and songs.  Remember when Dal Shabet did a mockumentary in a actual farmer's market concept during the debut-heavy 2012?  There's plenty of room for creativity even in a well-worn theme like aegyo.  There just have to be better ways for Hallyu fans to show support."
kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,amiaheroyet,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:36:46 2015 UTC,"That being said, I think it can also be a double edged sword when groups try to be too unique. E.g. when Wassup debuted with the twirking concept and some trio who debuted as a hip hop group (can't remember their name) with the b/w MV all trying to be ""gangsta"", I cringed so much."

The mentality that ""I cringed about how awkward and bad it was, therefore you shouldn't have tried"" leads to the very saturation you spoke against originally.   People still cringe at Rothko."
kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,amiaheroyet,2,Fri Jun 26 04:40:12 2015 UTC,"I really wish the hallyu thing would calm down a little, in regards to western markets. Kpop is already huge over most of asia. But, Despite having a fanbase in the west, It's never going to be as huge as it is there, for a variety of reasons.  I feel like most attempts at western success are a waste of time and resources."
kpopslumberparty,3b2mqd,Ephriel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:20:01 2015 UTC,"I think we're transitioning too. Just look at the hype towards the WG comeback. People are already looking forward to it with a sense of nostalgia. That says a lot, imho. When SNSD, 2NE1 and Kara disband, I'm definitely calling the end of the Gen-2.  Just curious though, where do you guys see the start of Gen-3? I'm thinking EXO, AOA and EXID, but it probably goes back a little further than that."

You can't really link a specific identity with a Reddit account, so we feel more free to post whatever we want without the fear of facing repercussions concerning our personal lives.  Also, based on your post history, you have been posting irrelevant threads in the kpop subreddit. /r/kpop really enforces high quality posts and from what I've seen, mods don't usually let text posts go through unless they're discussions that concern kpop in general and they're discussions that haven't been posted before or in a while. It would be great if you read the sidebar rules before posting to see what's allowed and what's not.  As for /r/snsd, I am less familiar with their rules because I don't visit it frequently anymore, but based on your post history, your posts seem to be ""crossing the line"" based on that subreddit's standards and would be heavily downvoted. Just like in /r/kpop, they enforce rules that could be seen in the sidebar.   I'm not trying to be hostile or anything, I'm just giving you advice on what to post and what not to post in those subreddits."

kpopslumberparty,3awx3t,pbdonut,8,Wed Jun 24 05:24:59 2015 UTC,"A Tiffany-related topic definitely belongs in /r/snsd. It's just that a topic about asking her out to prom is a little absurd.

It's beyond weird, it's pretty goddamn creepy and delusional. Also judging by the ridiculous number of times you've posted about this topic because it shows that you clearly don't know when to stop. It's not so much a matter of being 'too personal' it's just that the entire idea is ridiculous and creepy."

You say these things about my being ""creepy and delusional"" as if this shit isn't possible. I'm sorry that your dreams of marrying Baekhyun have been dashed due to the bad reputation that your fandom has unfortunately garnered, but that's no reason to lash out at me. There's nothing wrong with the fact that I want to meet one of my favorite idols. What you're being is not just blunt. Honestly."
kpopslumberparty,3awx3t,Teamshadenfreude,8,Thu Jun 25 00:46:43 2015 UTC,"I agree in the sense that I don't think it's creepy. It is, (however unfortunately) extremely delusional, and there is a difference between just wanting to meet your favorite idol and wanting to to go to your high school prom with them. You're just setting yourself up for disappointment.  Also, I can't help but comment on how extremely rude you are being:   I'm sorry that your dreams of marrying Baekhyun have been dashed due to the bad reputation that your fandom has unfortunately garnered, but that's no reason to lash out at me.   Nowhere in their comment (or post history) does it say anything suggesting something even remotely along these lines.

If I was generalizing the fanbase, then I would believe that they deserve their bad reputation. Therefore, I wouldn't have said that it was unfortunate. Because it is. The way that EXO's fans are seen nowadays is unfair to the fans who are simply supportive and respectful. And while I highly doubt that she's really a delulu, I've learned that people who want to picket others so enthusiastically usually have a skeleton-filled closet that can be pointed out with a neon sign just as easily."

Now, about what she said: How is what I said worse, or even as bad as what she said to me? She outright called me creepy and delusional. You could argue that she was simply criticizing my actions, but that's pretty much all she knows about me, so she might as well be insulting me. She's so lacking in respect for me as an intelligent human being that she tried to fucking pawn off her shit-talk as simply ""blunt truth,"" as if she expected me to take it at face value and feel better about what she'd said."

Key and Onew's enunciation in both Japanese and English are relatively better than the rest of the group, Taemin tends to slur his words and has a really strong Korean accent. Onew isn't actually that great at Japanese conversation compared to Jonghyun and Taemin though, he just sounds better when he sings.   I don't follow BB so closely but Seungri and Daesung are good at Japanese, followed by Taeyang, iirc. I would imagine the KARA girls to be good too. And TVXQ/JYJ and Boa, of course."
kpopslumberparty,3amgj6,haru_69,6,Sun Jun 21 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"Watching the early clips of Onew trying to speak in Japanese to audiences or in interviews was both painful and cute at the same time. And Key always picking on him and correcting him.   Learning Japanese as a native Korean speaker seems like it would be way easier than learning English. From what I know about Korean, the grammatical structure of the language is very similar to Japanese. Of course, being able to read anything complex in Japanese is a huge pain in the ass unless you are very familiar with kanji. The Korean alphabet is both beautiful visually and in its design."
kpopslumberparty,3amgj6,youhadmeathelo,4,Sun Jun 21 21:26:57 2015 UTC,Kanji makes it much faster to read and understand sentences which is why Im in a love-hate relationship with it. Ive been learning korean too  but find it easier to understand japanese despite korean having 1 alphabet instead of 3.
kpopslumberparty,3amgj6,sangtoms,2,Sun Jun 21 22:55:19 2015 UTC,"Oh I love kanji! Once you start to become familiar with the basic kanjis, it gets so much easier to pick up new ones. And sometimes you might not know the reading of a kanji, but based on context of the sentence and what parts go into that particular character it makes it so much easier to guess the meaning than from English words at times. It is kind of a cool feeling when you understand a written word without knowing at all what the reading is. But yeah, you have to get over the massive road block of learning enough to do this.   I wasn't introduced to kanji until my second year classes. I really wish they had started from the beginning. Learning kanji as you learn words makes so much more sense rather than waiting and then just dumping random kanji on you later and trying to learn heaps of readings. Reading anything in Japanese without kanji sucks. It's all one long string of characters you spend too much time trying to pick apart."
kpopslumberparty,3amgj6,youhadmeathelo,8,Sun Jun 21 23:52:57 2015 UTC,"I know both Chinese and Japanese, and I usually can't listen to kpop groups singing in those languages without cringing or feeling awkward. Like u/Shawtaay said, you can tell the difference between the Chinese and Korean members immediately.  It isn't always so bad; for example, Key's Japanese is good.  But even with my bias, BTS, I feel so weird listening to their Japanese songs. I love them but I can't listen to them without laughing (´ ▽｀)"
kpopslumberparty,3amgj6,beepingsheep,7,Sun Jun 21 19:02:37 2015 UTC,"I am Chinese, and I can't listen to Exo-M songs because of their very heavy accents. I often don't understand clearly what they are saying, which gets distracting, so I just stick with the Korean versions.   The only Suju-M song I've listened to is Swing, and they are a bit better IMO. Of course, their pronunciation aside from Zhou Mi's isn't perfect.   T-ara's pronunciation in Little Apple was actually quite good."
kpopslumberparty,3amgj6,unicornbottle,8,Mon Jun 22 06:21:45 2015 UTC,"I don't personally know Chinese, but my friends who are native speakers say you can immediately tell if a Korean member of EXO-M is singing. The Chinese members are fine, but they say that the Korean members have very heavy accents."
kpopslumberparty,3amgj6,Shawtaay,5,Sun Jun 21 18:11:25 2015 UTC,"Seems like it.  Whenever I hear Chanyeol rap in Chinese (Love Me Right for example), it almost sounds like Korean at times if it weren't for all the ""sh"" and ""ch"" 's. I could imagine a Chinese person hearing it way more than me who doesn't speak Chinese and still hears it"
kpopslumberparty,3amgj6,charleswhatnow,3,Sun Jun 21 18:22:07 2015 UTC,"I speak Japanese and a lot of groups/singers have accents or have choppier pronunciation, but it's not normally to the point where I can't understand. Off the top of my head, in 'Catch Me If You Can' some parts were a lot more... staccato? (the 'itsuka kita basho / itsuka mita yume / itsuka atta hito' part took me a while to parse)   I find the difference pronunciation/accents interesting though as I've also learnt it as a second language so it's kind of fun recognising little quirks. I don't know if I'd have liked Winner as much without Mino's drawn-out 'kohkohroh'.   From what I've listened to, Seungri is pretty good, B1A4 was good, any groups with faster/hip-hop style songs tend to lose a bit (eg BTS and Block B, although Hormone War sounded decent) just because it's hard to get translate a rap to fit the song, still make sense, and deliver it fluently. I haven't listened to any Japanese Shinee songs since I've learnt the members' voices actually so I'll give it a listen today and see if I can tell Taemin apart/understand him."
kpopslumberparty,3amgj6,youhadmeathelo,2,Sun Jun 21 22:17:46 2015 UTC,Just don't go for the Korean songs translated into Japanese. It's so painfully obvious that Japanese just does not fit into the flow of the songs. Lucifer and Sherlock are particularly bad offenders.
kpopslumberparty,3amgj6,funwithgoats,2,Sun Jun 21 23:57:51 2015 UTC,Interesting answer.  I feel like the Chinese version of Overdose sounded better than most Chinese songs by EXO.  Is it just a rumor or is it true that the song was first written in Chinese and then translated to Korean?
kpopslumberparty,3amgj6,nothingisred,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:41:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are no official sources on that, sadly.  But the chinese Overdose really does sound good, most say that even better than the Korean which led to people thinking it was written in Chinese first"

He is right, but it makes him look kind of pathetic to be getting involved in some petty fight with a boy band over who wins more music shows.

Of course they're all talented and such but I feel like it would add so much if they would at least try to write their own stuff like SHINee started doing.  Chanyeol is arguably the first proper rapper SM recruited, he's got the rapping skill because he's actually working to develop it, his voice tone is good too and I doubt he can't write his own raps after all this time. He's got to have some inspiration from all the hiphop/ rap he's listening to.  It's not like people want EXO to write and produce all their music alone, but just contributing a little bit would be nice."

(Sorry for the long comment omg I got too into it ><)  First there's actually an active forum already for photocards here. I use it, and like 99% of its users are trustworthy, very very rarely you come across a scammer on there. Buuuut in order to be able to make an account you have to have a past trade with one of the site's users.   Which brings me to the photocard tag on tumblr. Probably not as trustworthy because anybody can just make a sell post on tumblr, but still I'd say a good 90% of people in this tag you can trust. A lot of them are from the forum above, and as your trading with someone it won't hurt to ask if they're on the forum so they can refer you! That's how I got my account~ Also a few tips: always ask the person for pictures of the card, and then shipping proof (the envelope/receipt), and ask to see feedback from their previous trades/sells. A good trader/seller with nothing to hide should always provide these things  Facebook groups are good too! There's a good number of them, but you have to be a bit more cautious there. I'm in one called USA Kpop Photocard Sell/Trade/Buy or something like that.  Sites I'd avoid (at least until you're a bit more experienced): Instagram and Youtube.  Recommended eBay sellers: tobewithkpopbuyer, eiqowo, lycheejelly (I know him personally), jace0337. But there's definitely more. Remember to always look at the sellers' feedback.

kpopslumberparty,3a4ib6,Uanaka,12,Wed Jun 17 04:08:25 2015 UTC,"I think the band groups like CN Blue and FT Island if they put in the effort. I personally think rock is an easier genre to cross cultures with, and the fact that they all play their own instruments could help them tremendously; as people would be less likely to view them as manufactured like they probably would with most of kpop.  I honestly think it'd be really hard for Dance related groups to make it.   Honestly I don't know anything about hip hop outside of K-Pop so I can't make an educated analysis on that.  I think the size of some of the groups would be off-putting to a lot of people. So It'd probably have to be smaller groups (like 5 or less members)  Soloists. Maybe IU? I think if she embraced the Musical style she has with songs like Red Shoes, You&I, Good Day she might be able to find a decent niche."

He's an adult man who's less than 5 and a half feet tall and has pink hair, a slender Asian build, and a cute baby face; none of that screams ""sex-appeal"" by American standards.   Something I didn't mention in the other thread was that I think girl groups would have a better shot image-wise since the beauty standards for women in America are more comparable to those for women in Korea than those of American men vs. Korean men, as long as it's a smaller group that speaks English well and the individual members are styled very uniquely. It would be a shame for a group to try to break into America and the only comments they get are the typical (and sometimes racist) ""they all look the same/I can't tell them apart."""

Boygroups, if they work these days, have to make a real effort to not come across as ""the typical boy group"", which is why you will never see One Direction dance in an MV (or a performance) really.   Fake ""authenticity"" is the key to Western pop.

Now I personally don't know, but kpop idol groups essentially define korea's music scene, and until the companies suddenly die out and the netizens forget about it, I don't think they'll ever go away.  I think with idol group debuts, they seem similar, because they're supposed to be similar? Something similar, means it's something safe, it's what people are comfortable with, it's not something new that puts the newly debuted idol group at the edge of a cliff. Companies don't want the BIGGEST BESTEST DEBUT, they want a debut that can sustain a group in the future."
kpopslumberparty,39z29b,WANGFlRE,14,Mon Jun 15 23:13:37 2015 UTC,"I think any group that has a decent amount of English speakers or can perform well in English could do well. If we're talking about America specifically, foreign language songs typically don't get very big unless they've got some kind of viral appeal and, even then, it's just for the novelty of it.   Besides language, another struggle that boy groups would have though is the huge difference between beauty standards in America vs. Korea. In Korea, boy groups are made up of really good looking guys and their fans usually think of them as such but I'm sure we've all been in the position of showing kpop to our non-kpop friends and gotten comments on how they think the idols look. Girly, small, feminine, etc. Asian men have been struggling for years to overcome America's bias against portraying them as sexually desirable in the media. Actors like Steven Yeun and KiHong Lee have been making strides in that department lately, but I think America is still a long way away from our preteens falling for EXO as hard as they fall for One Direction."

Even the two you mentioned are muuuuuch more muscular than what seems to be the norm in korea. But that's the norm here. You want to be Muscular and more traditionally western masculine.   It's fascinating, on one hand, to see the differences.   That being said, ""doing well in america"" is a very relative term. Outside of the biggest pop stuff, It seems there really isn't a singular taste in the country.  I mean, this is true everywhere of course, But I just can't see any kpop group ""Sweeping the nation"" outside of the already established subculture."
kpopslumberparty,39z29b,Ephriel,7,Tue Jun 16 00:32:00 2015 UTC,"I think it would be interesting to see how Americans react to the idols that are more fit/buff than the standard flower boys.

It seems like the companies want their groups to get internationally recognised, but they don't release english songs, and make their idols more appealing to a westeren audience (Lay in Call Me Baby was really well received by westerners, partly because of his light makeup and english lines). Not that I would prefer that, just something I have been thinking about"
kpopslumberparty,39z29b,Ephriel,6,Tue Jun 16 00:24:43 2015 UTC,"TBH, I don't think releasing english material will really help them that much.  Novelty is really the biggest thing they'd have going for them."

I found kpop through reddit actually! I was bored on night and stumbled across this AMA. I knew nothing of kpop (beyond Gangnam Style), but decided to check out this strange sounding ""Crayon Pop"" he mentioned in his comment and was hooked immediately.  One thing you'll discover about kpop is how it spreads into other realms of Korean pop culture: variety shows, dramas (TV shows) and even movies sometimes. The Korean pop culture system is a very slick system and there are ample opportunities to discover new acts and get sucked in further.  Music shows play a prominent role in kpop, too. There are 4 major music shows that are broadcast on Korean TV each week, where kpop groups that are currently promoting go on to compete against each other. /u/MrFujiKicker is a cool redditor who posts summaries of these music shows each week with links to their performances. It's a good way to discover new acts and keep abreast with who's currently promoting in Korea.  Other than that, just hang out in /r/kpop and watch new music that's being released.  If you like the club sound, the first song that came to mind is 2ne1's I Am the Best. (Edit: you might like SNSD's Catch Me If You Can, too)"

With regards to Gangnam Style, when that went massive, I enjoyed the song like everyone else, had a laugh with it and that was it for me. I did not think about the back ground of the song really just ' oh its some random Korean man who has made an extremely catchy song '. Two years later and I find kpop. I will check out the links you have provided. Many thanks!"
kpopslumberparty,39u526,jjaebum,2,Sun Jun 14 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"Hooray, more K-pop fans! Make sure to blast your music really loud in the car with your friends and spread K-pop to the world! haha. When I first started getting into kpop, my friend made this beginners playlist (edit: just realized she added some newer songs to this, so there are some newish songs) to help me get my feet wet. However, this is from over two years, but trust me, these songs are still very relevant today. She also made an additional playlist several months ago.  I recommend GOT7 but that's just me haha. As for individual songs:   GOT7 - Stop Stop It (lol ok I'll stop shoving GOT7 at you) 2PM - Go Crazy! (my favorite song of 2014, maybe even ever) BTS - Sick (no mv yet, but there will be soon! So get pumped!) UNIQ - EOEO (hmm, are you male or female? Either way you should listen to this song!) Bastarz - Conduct Zero Mad Clown - Fire   These are all pretty recent songs that I really enjoyed. I tried to pick ones that might appeal to you, so hopefully you enjoy them and haven't already heard all of these already (i dunno how deep in you are yet haha)"

I stumbled across this ISH list video, which I clicked on because I misread it as ""7 pop songs you should know right now"" and I love bubblegum pop music and Sherlock is in the list. After some quick googling, I fell straight down the rabbit hole.  That was 3 years ago and now I'm living in Korea! My reasons for being here aren't entirely attributed to kpop but kpop did play a part in putting Korea on the map for me!  I hope you have as much fun discovering all this genre has to offer as I did!  Edit: My apologies, I didn't leave you any song recommendations! I am a huge advocate of 'nugu' boy groups in the kpop scene. 'Nugu' is the Korean word for ""who"" so nugu groups are little lesser known groups that don't have very big fan bases. Here are some nugus that I think you'll like!   HIGH4 - Baby Boy - I've been really into them lately. Nice beats, really solid vocalists. Legend - I Wanna Know Legend - Lost 100% - Want U Back BIGFLO - Delilah BIGSTAR - Run & Run Mr.Mr - Do You Feel Me?

The korean League of Legends tournament used to play AOA's Miniskirt in the breaks, and i really liked that song, and later (December 2014) i found a cute video of Girl's Day's Hyeri, and now, i listen to Kpop non stop. Oh, I'm from Denmark btw.  I like up-beat songs a lot, but i'm also into the chill down-tempo songs. The genres i listen to is mostly the same as you (Hiphop, Rap, R&B, House and Dubstep)  So i have some songs i wanna recommend to you :-P. I produce music myself (Rap beats and some house music aswell) and one of things that impress me the most about Kpop other than the incredible talent of the artists, is the production. So most of the stuff that i'll link now, sounds good production wise imo. A little plus, most of the link is the dance version videos, thought you would find it interesting (Even though every song of course have their own music video with the choreography and short scenes :-P).  Girl's Day - Expectation(기대해)  Very up-beat and catchy. Girl's Day only have 4 members (compared to most girl groups who have atleast 5 members or more) but their personality is so open and they're very fun and charming at interviews. My personal favorite group :-P. They're coming out with a new song in the start of July (New releases in Kpop is normally called a ''comeback'')  EXID - Up and Down  EXID - Ah Yeah  Both songs are up-beat and catchy with a bit of rap, but also very strong vocal and singing aswell.   HyunA - Red  Hyuna is a member of 4minute and her song ''Red'' got the same kinda trap up-beat feel as 4minute's ''Crazy''.  AOA - Miniskirt  The song that got me into Kpop. It's not directly up-beat, but i just find the instrumental very catchy and fresh. I think you'll maybe like it.  If you're into instrumentals and production, i can link you more Kpop songs with great instrumental, or just the song in general ofc lmao. If you have anymore questions, just ask :-)"

When they came to DC last year, I won VVIP tickets to the show, and got to chat a very small amount with him while they were signing posters.  He was the only one of them up there (this was after show and high touch events, which alone took well over an hour) that seemed to still be actively engaging and genuinely happy, while the others just looked a tired.  He was actually the one who started talking to me, and he was very nice, polite, and I got the vibe that he genuinely wanted to hear the answer, not just ask the question out of obligation.  He asked me how the show was, and when I said it was great, he seemed really happy.  Then I said, ""No, really, it was a pleasure to get to be here and see you guys perform,"" and he smiled the biggest, most adorable smile and said, ""Thank you! I'm so glad you enjoyed it!"" before handing me my poster back.  Best. Day. Ever."

The visual is a role typically assigned by the company to the prettiest member. You can sometimes find ""visual"" listed in member profiles where another member's might say ""main vocal"". The face is something that's obtained by the most popular/recognizable member.   An example off the top of my head is Apink. Naeun takes the visual role but Eunji became the face after Reply 1997.

Both this and their other song (blossom?) are very pretty and they're great singers that complement each other's voices.

kpopslumberparty,39856g,GloriousGrapefruit,14,Tue Jun 9 23:08:49 2015 UTC,"Gather round, children, and listen to the trauma of my first norebang in Korea.   It was part of a staff dinner with my school so it was me and 6 or 7 Korean teachers, only 2 of them speak any English but the rest tend to tolerate me fine without speaking to me. They had a blast singing old Korean songs that I didn't know but they all knew and loved. Then they're like, ""Majek, you've been studying Korean! Sing us a Korean song!"" At this point, I had been in Korea for like 1 month and my proficiency was super pathetic. I relented and went with EXO's Miracles in December because I thought that the song was slow enough that I could read the hangul on the screen. Long story short; it was not slow enough lol I knew the chorus parts by heart so I did those fine but when the verses happened I got like, 30% of the words. It was just going by too fast. Also, all of these other teachers are old enough to be my parents, so they're super out of touch with idols and current kpop songs so they couldn't even save me by singing along. It was so awkward and uncomfortable.   TL;DR - I butchered an EXO song while 7 middle-aged Koreans stared me down. I am scarred.  Since them I've been to norebang with some of my foreign friends here but only sang English songs because they're not really into kpop. Those were much less stressful occasions. I'd like to try Korean songs again, but maybe in the company of some kpop loving foreign friends who won't be judging me for not knowing all of the words lol"

This was before I discovered reddit. These days I find 90% of reactions annoying, especially from the ""big reacters"" with the most subscribers. I agree with /u/littlemallow though seeing genuine reactions is still fun for me occasionally. Review stuff as well.  I also enjoyed some of the ""non-kpop fans reacting to kpop"" formats because it can be quite hilarious. One of my favourite channels for that was JAJ because they were just three good friends who had some hilarious comments. Unfortunately they got flooded with ""plz react to xyz oppar"" comments and if they said something remotely critical (most of their comments are just done for comedic purpose to begin with), they got hated on by some boygroup fandoms, which is why they stopped doing reactions."

It's so nice to see how much he's grown and improved over the years. His personality is pretty interesting, probably from spending so much time around his weirdo group members from a young age, but he seems really level-headed and dedicated to his work. You can tell that dancing and now singing are things that he's truly passionate about, and not just something to make him famous so he can do other things. Not to mention that I think he's one of the most talented people in kpop. He's not really my bias in SHINee (so hard to choose, honestly), but I love that little shit."

He was tone deaf and his singing wasn't great back in the day (tho his dancing was always really great), and now he's one of the best singers in SHINee. It's hard to choose a favorite vocal in SHINee now because he just gives so much competition, just listen to View haha.

kpopslumberparty,38z517,beepingsheep,14,Mon Jun 8 08:35:44 2015 UTC,"Joy, back when she was the maknae. She did a perfect job of being the adorable, bubbly, clumsy maknae.   For fave maknae of all time, I would say Seungri. He does such a wonderful job with the cute yet mischievous maknae image, he gets teased by his hyungs but teases them back all the time, and injects a lot of energy and humour into the group. I first got interested in Big Bang not through their music, but through YouTube clips of Seungri (this was even before I really got into kpop). He's just so entertaining."
kpopslumberparty,38z517,unicornbottle,13,Mon Jun 8 02:52:36 2015 UTC,"I'm copying my response to the Favorite Friday thread about maknaes. It still holds up. Always will.   We all know this person as Lee Seunghyun. Little Seunghyun. Panda. (Lord) Seungri.  We're the same age, but no matter how much he's grown, no matter how far he's come, Seungri will always be that little pipsqueak from the BIGBANG documentary. And I think that's who he'll always be inside.  He loves to worry the shit of of his hyungs. Proof here. He's probably put BB through so much, putting him on blast when they're on variety or even just appearing on TV is just what they gotta do.  But like all maknaes, he's tortured. Remember that one time when BB posted a backstage photo without Seungri? And the fans were like, ""Where's Panda?"" And they got him, threw him down, and made them happy? Like, ""Okay. We got him for you. Here is Seungri."" Taeyang's showing some tough love here. And here. Hyungs gonna hyung.  Don't worry, though. He's loved. Most of all by GD. Seungri is Tory. But the whole group loves. He's what keeps them going. When Seungri is happy, BIGBANG is happy. When he's smiling, everybody is okay. He is the group's energy.  So, congratulations, you handsome asshole jerk. You're the maknae of my heart.     Bonus: The Little Nerd grew up and looks so fly now!  Freakin' Riri. YG's Beethoven. Dancer. Choreographer. Composer. Troublemaker."

He may not be the best vocalist or dancer of the group, but he's definitely the visual and he's got a great heart, just like the other members of the group.  He's very talented, too, knowing how to play the piano and violin well and knows Chinese and Japanese pretty decently. His dad's a professor, too, so the others say that he's very smart (doesn't prove so in BEAST Show Time when he thought Beethoven composed The Four Seasons even when I believe it was Yoseob said that he likes Vivaldi's Four Seasons). This basically wraps it up for me.  It's great that he's getting more opportunities this year to appear in shows and is releasing his Japanese solo this July :)"

He had the best solo work of BB IMO. He worked really hard on VVIP even though he didn't have much time to work on it (I think he only recorded it within a week?). His album was one of the first k-pop music I've ever bothered to purchase and previously I was never into k-pop at the time. The solo showed that he's not only multi-talented including singing and dancing but also hella handsome and IMO the best looking guy in the group. And, despite being the Big Bang maknae, he's the eldest sibling in his family and works his butt off and shows love for his siblings and parents. Respect."

Seungri's just a cute ball of mischief and I couldn't imagine BIGBANG without him! I still can't understand how I find him cute and sexy both at the same time... and now BLONDE... ugh, he pulls it off soooo well!  My close second favourite maknae would be San Cheong~ He's soooo cute!!

I find YiJeong's facial expressions, especially during the Performance Ver., to be the most racy, which I think adds to the sexual tension of the song.

I found I Like 2 Party kind of dull but I haven't watched the MV yet.   You might be feeling this way because Big Bang is THE most hyped group in kpop and they are finally coming back after three years, so obviously everyone is losing their minds. Another thing is that everyone also treats BB and the songs they produce like they are the holy grail and are all pop masterpieces.   I have noticed that every time a group releases something you can expect comments based on what the group is. For example, when SNSD releases their new track people will say ""wow, they are so pretty"" and ""the song is kind of eh?"" When EXO release a song people will say ""oh yeah, obviously their stupid fangirls will support them."" When Beast releases a ballad, everyone goes ""Wow, great music, as expected of Beast."" When BB release a song, everyone goes ""ASDHJAHLJH Of course Big Bang is the best!!!! No one can touch their music!!!! They are geniuses!!!"""

I really don't get the purpose of posts like this though. I felt the same about the ""I still prefer EXO over WINNER"" post months back. Seriously what's the purpose of these posts?

So yeah, obviously I can't speak for other people's music taste but I feel like a lot of the hype around the tracks just comes from VIPs or people who want to like anything that comes out of a big group."
kpopslumberparty,38jbpu,BrigidAndair,2,Thu Jun 4 23:13:35 2015 UTC,"I don't usually listen to Boy groups but Loser and Bae Bae were ok. But, I didn't really find Bang Bang Bang and We like 2 party to be as good as the former."
kpopslumberparty,38jbpu,dragwoo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:15:49 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean.  I loved every track off of Alive, but with the way that each member's solo activities had been going, I had kind of prepared myself for a very different comeback this time.  The songs themselves...I'm very on the fence about.  I can't seem to get into Loser at all, but, after the first few listens that I didn't like a whole lot, I've started to really like Bae Bae.  Bang Bang Bang is okay as long as you can pump the bass up to vibrating levels (this is also what I think about GD songs like Michi Go and Crayon), but I'm not horribly enamoured with it.  By far my favorite of all of them is We Like 2 Party, though.  I've been listening to it a lot since yesterday, and it just feels refreshing after the others.  It's much more laid back and relaxed, and I really enjoy that.  Plus, Daesung is ridiculously adorable/dorky in the video, so that helps.  As someone who would refer to themselves as a VIP, I can't quite decide how much I'm enjoying it all as a whole, but I'm still excited that it's happening.  It's a brilliant marketing move to release the tracks slowly over the course of several months, too, which I think is helping build the hype to almost unbearable levels in the VIP community.  I'd guess that this is more why this is so huge: It's not as much that everyone is loving the songs, but it's exciting that they're releasing new material, and that we don't know what's coming next."

kpopslumberparty,38j62e,immyongsoo,15,Thu Jun 4 15:55:36 2015 UTC,"SHINee:  I feel like if SHINee were girls, not a whole lot would change, haha. Their name could definitely stay the same. Being from SM, their popularity is pretty much guaranteed as well. Taemin is probably the most popular member right now, and I feel like Taemin would be popular as a girl as well - simultaneously cute and sexy, with excellent dance skills and very good vocal ability. I think Jonghyun would also receive a lot of popularity since there aren't many female idols who write their own music. Onew would definitely be popular among people who really like the ""cute"" type, and Minho would be popular among those who like the ""sexy"" type. I think Key would be the most popular member in terms of female fans. Their music style would be similar, except with perhaps a bit more emphasis on their really great vocals."
kpopslumberparty,38j62e,followthesound,8,Thu Jun 4 20:05:16 2015 UTC,"GEAST:  For female producers, there's LE. She pretty much produces (or co-produces) all of EXID's songs, and she also worked on Troublemaker, T-ara Sugar Free, Hyuna, etc. So no doubt female Junhyung would still keep making great songs.   For GEAST, Hyunseung would hands down be the visual. That guy is literally so pretty that I sometimes get speechless. He totally fits the Korean beauty standard, with beautiful, large (and natural!) eyes, fair skin, high nose bridge, V-shaped face, and slim build, so him as the visual would be no question. In the kpop world, being a female visual means that he will get a lot of attention and rake in the CFs, so he would most likely be one of the most popular members of GEAST.  I feel that GEAST would be the group that plays to each member's individual quirks and uniqueness, rather than being a glossy girl group. Doojoon (the famous boyfriend-dol) probably wouldn't be as popular, and while people wouldn't be praising female Yoseob for his looks they would find him and Gikwang really charming. They would still be variety darlings, host shows, etc.   I don't know where Dongwoon fits in all this, because he doesn't have that much of a presence in B2ST, but he would be the girl in charge of being tall and having ""exotic"" looks (kinda like Sooyoung from SNSD)."
kpopslumberparty,38j62e,unicornbottle,4,Fri Jun 5 01:50:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like GEAST Hyunseung would be like the Hyuna of that world except with even more superior vocal skills (sorry Hyuna fans). Hyunseung's recent solo shows that he likes to venture off from the regular CUBE style songs, so GEAST Hyunseung would definitely be the risky type and would have a very successful solo. But yes, he'd definitely be visual (my god did you see his sister's pictures?) alongside Dongwoon.  You're definitely right about GEAST Doojoon not being as popular. I can't really put a finger on why exactly, though. I would say Doojoon and Kikwang will become the least popular (which is funny since they're the most popular of BEAST...)  Maybe instead of belting high Fs (which is just decent for a soprano), GEAST Yoseob will be belting high As or Bs."
kpopslumberparty,38j62e,unicornbottle,5,Fri Jun 5 02:13:47 2015 UTC,"Totally agree on female Hyunseung being wildly successful. There's this stereotype that visuals are untalented and used only for obligatory rap breakdowns, so imagine the sensation of a visual who also tears up the dance floor and has good vocals. The one thing that wouldn't change is that he'd still shy away from variety in general.   For Doojoon, it's that I can't imagine him as a girl at all because he strikes me as really masculine."

kpopslumberparty,38ex1e,floating_around,20,Wed Jun 3 19:33:38 2015 UTC,"In order of release:   Bae Bae by Big Bang. It took a while for this song to grow on me, but now I love it. I really dig when Big Bang gets a little weird and experimental. The mixture of the super-chill acoustic guitar and rapping and super fast trap percussion somehow works really well. I also love TOP's rapping style in this song. Excuse Me by BESTie. There are so many things I love about this song - the excellent vocal performance, the harmonies, the saxophone riffs, the super loud and super low brass in the second part of the chorus, the double-time section, the integration of the rapping... But what really makes this song special is how well all those individual awesome parts work together.  Kontrol by Kim Sunggyu. Sunggyu has such a gorgeous voice, and I just can't get over how much I love the chorus. The high-pitched synths and the contrast between the super-fast subdivision in the percussion and Sunggyu's soaring vocals is so good. View by SHINee. This is my first of three SHINee songs on this list because bias. :P This song is the ultimate chill summer jam. I love the synth tones and their group vocals in the chorus, and there are some really great harmonies in the verses! I'm kind of obsessed with Onew's ad-libs around the second chorus, too. Odd Eye by SHINee. This is already one of my all-time favourite SHINee songs. The song has Jonghyun written all over it - I love the strings at the beginning, and Jonghyun, Taemin, And Onew's falsetto in the choruses is absolutely heavenly. I also adore the laid-back rapping style Minho uses in this song. Trigger by SHINee. Trigger is the One Minute Back of this album - it takes a lot of musical risks that all really pay off. The melodic vocal line at 0:47 is so unexpected and cool. There are so many awesome, super-tight group harmonies as well. Coffee and Tea by Eddy Kim featuring Solar from Mamamoo. I'm not normally a big fan of songs that are super stripped-down with just acoustic guitar, percussion, and vocals, but Eddy Kim and Solar's voices just work so beautifully together and I really like the harmonies. Adore U by Seventeen. It's hard to believe that this is Seventeen's debut song - the singing and rapping is really, really good. Not only that, but Woozi wrote and produced it and Hoshi helped choreograph it? Seriously, this song is so well written and arranged, I can't pick out anything I dislike about it. I especially love Jeonghan and Woozi's vocals, and Vernon's rapping. I'm very excited to see what this group will put out in the future."

History- Just Might Die This song is fairly generic, but I really like the dance though and...uh... the guys are really attractive....so I've been listening to this one a lot. And all the versions they're releasing have kept me coming back for more! I really would like to learn more about the members and will have to watch the stuff from this thread but if anyone knows of any other stuff to watch I would be super happy   Kara- Cupid I can always count of Kara to have jam-worthy songs and this does not disappoint. Although it's not as good as Mama Mia I still really like the song and the chorus is perfection.  Now time to rave about shinee  I'll pick just two songs but it'll be hard....  Love Sick- I'm honestly addicted to this song. I need a doctor 'cuz YOU KNOW I LIKE IT I LOVE IT. This has become one of my favorite shinee songs ever. I love that it's a continuation of Replay.

Sulli has been under a lot of criticism for her scandal with Choiza and she took a long break from being an idol. Rumor has it that she wanted to leave f(x) last summer but was convinced by the other members to take a break and return after.  Krystal has little reasons to trust SM after they screwed her sister by convincing her to sign another contract then locked her in a dungeon. She also has her own reasons as SM won't release the already recorded Jessica & Krystal album and canceled the second season of their reality show.

Like a delinquent and a jackass covered in (literal) scars. It just really makes me want to go back to when I was young and start over, to not mess up so damn much.  However, on the same note, I also felt like El Dorado by Exo was the story of my last year in school. There was a lot up in the air and it wasn't known if I would graduate on time, get a GPA over 1.5, or even get all the lost classes made up in time. But I did. The El Dorado for me was walking up that stage to accept my diploma after doing over two years of credits in a year.   And there's just something about Kyungsoo's ""Now we're here"" that makes me feel completely at peace. I actually whispered it to myself as I walked on stage graduation night.   ""Countless times have passed us by. I’m even more excited for the days to come""  Talking about Exo, Kpop in general, or my future, these words bring me an overwhelming amount of comfort.   I could quote that song forever. It's nearly word for word what I kept telling myself. That I'll show those who believed in me that they were right. Ugh, the feels that song gives me."

kpopslumberparty,382s09,emii_gems,6,Thu Jun 4 23:43:15 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking about something really similar the other day. I fell in love with Seventeen's debut song and a couple of their members in particular and it reminded me that I don't like big groups because the members never get enough room to adequately shine. If you've got 12 or 13 members, unless there are really active sub-units, it's just not possible for the members that are the sub-vocals or the secondary rappers to get more than one or two lines per song. Hell, Chen is a main vocal in his group and I still sometimes think of how much more he'd get to do if he was in a 5 member group (I'm takin' OT12/11/10/9, I know M was a 6 member group but I think he and Xiumin were kinda limited in how much of a fanbase they could get in M because the Chinese members were way more popular in China than the Korean members but that's a different story.)  I think it's really a shame when members are cursed to be one-liners. Like, you spend so much time training and working hard to improve yourself and you're in the entertainment industry so you are obviously interested in having attention from the public, but you're expected to just take your one line and dance in the background while your coworkers consistently outshine/overshadow you. Those members still have fans and if they're pro-active they can do stuff on the side like acting or releasing covers or producing in order to stand out in their group and in the industry, but it's not often that you see one of those members being super popular, which is unfortunate. I can see some people thinking it would be nice to just be in a popular group, even if you're not one of the more popular members, but I can't imagine that situation happening without at least a little jealousy. It's gotta sting a little to always be low on the priority list."
kpopslumberparty,382s09,majekmistake,3,Mon Jun 1 14:53:27 2015 UTC,"I know that Peniel is the one-liner of BTOB, going on between one-line raps, to one-line melodies, to one-line English sentences, since he's American-born.  It really does suck that he's just thrown a line or two, so people can't really complain he doesn't get lines at all. In Wow, he doesn't get a single line. People say that he is the weakest vocalist of BTOB, which I do agree, but he's compared to these goddamn amazing singers, so it kind of emphasizes his ""weakness.""  When we think of kpop rappers, we usually think that it's because they are weak singers, but if you watch this video of Minhyuk (the rapper, visual, and main/lead dancer of BTOB) and Sungjae singing Doll, I was goddamn blown away that Minhyuk, a rapper, can sing that well. So really, Peniel's being compared to really amazing singers.  Here's a video of Peniel singing I'm Yours by Jason Mraz, and he sounds fine, but people aren't wrong when they say he is the weakest vocalist of the group. Peniel was a JYP trainee for 2 years (like a lot of CUBE artists) but switched over to CUBE for only ~2 months before debut, so they had to have had a reason for picking Peniel, when most of his other members trained with CUBE for 2 years.  Hopefully, he'll start to get more lines in the future when he further improves his singing. It's kind of like Dongwoon in the earlier years. He'd only get a few lines each song, but now he gets a whole verse/chorus to himself sometimes. I admit, in the older songs, like Shock or Mystery, he really sounded pretty weird, but now that he has developed his voice, he sounds so much better.  But honestly, Peniel looks happy with who he's with and where he is, so if any one-line members are happy where they are, I personally think it's fine. They'll surely have their own fans, maybe not as much, but if they're happy with one line each song, then to each their own. Maybe some of them are like you, where they prefer to have fewer lines. Who knows?"
kpopslumberparty,382s09,immyongsoo,3,Mon Jun 1 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"I like Peniel and he seems like an outstanding guy. But I was thinking back to the thread where people were talking about Jihyun being useless in 4minute (which I have to agree with), and I can't think about what Peniel brings to his group.   BtoB already have good rappers (who also produce), great variety talent, and solid dance and vocals. Peniel doesn't seem very comfortable on variety (maybe due to language barrier, he's fine on After School Club), and to be honest his English skills aren't that big of a draw. He's not a visual member, the main dancer, and he's just...there. A lot of people have been curious as to why he got chosen into BtoB despite training only two months at CUBE, because I know for a fact that there were other male trainees who didn't make it into BtoB."
kpopslumberparty,382s09,unicornbottle,3,Mon Jun 1 18:06:00 2015 UTC,"Apparently, the other members called him the ""secret weapon,"" but otherwise, you're right. Jihyun and Peniel are basically useless for 4Minute and BTOB respectively.  I mean, if CUBE still wants them and they love music, this is a great experience for them. They may not bring anything special to the group, but I don't feel like they bring down the group either. Sure, they may not be as vocally skilled or may not dance as well as other members, but every group is bound to have a ""weak"" member, may it be a miniscule amount. If we take out Jihyun from 4Minute or Peniel from BTOB, there's still going to be a weak member, maybe just not as noticeable.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the members distribute the lines amongst each other and it's someone else's job to assign the lines, so if that's true, the problem really goes back to companies to giving the ""useless"" members enough of a role. No one wants to be known for being useless.  I don't listen to too many 4Minute songs, but if we switched Jiyoon's lines with Jihyun's line in Crazy (because Reddit seems to love Jiyoon), would the majority of Redditors still call Jihyun's interjection weird and continue to ""bash"" on Jihyun? I remember seeing negative comments and a dispute about Jihyun being useless, but if Jihyun and Jiyoon switched places, I would think that more would focus on the interjection itself being weird and not really bash on Jiyoon. There's just that bias that once everyone starts saying someone's useless, all you'll see in the music is how useless said member is.  There's even bias for those who support the ""useless"" members, at least for me. I know that Peniel is the ""useless"" one-liner, so I would always listen for his lines and feel proud that his one line happens to be my favourite in the song. If it weren't this mindset of him being ""useless,"" then I wouldn't actively seek for his parts. Same for Jihyun. I never really listened to 4Minute until this year, but seeing all the dispute with Jihyun, I like to actively listen for her parts. I don't hate her or think she's shit, but the knowledge that some people dislike her because she's ""useless"" makes me look out for her more (she's not my fav of 4M though, Gayoon is).  I'm sorry if none of this made sense; I'm just rambling on. I have difficulties with piecing what I think into comprehensive sentences, haha."
kpopslumberparty,382s09,immyongsoo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:43:39 2015 UTC,"I understand you. However, Jihyun showed through her solo in Crazy that she still has zero stage presence. If you are going to have one line, you better rock that one line.   Hyoyeon was always assigned one line in SNSD and always put near the back for half her career, but she always performed the hell out of that one line and made her presence known."
kpopslumberparty,382s09,unicornbottle,3,Tue Jun 2 02:29:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you for settling in my head what was bugging me about Jihyun. She's a pretty girl and she seems really sweet, her voice isn't that bad except for it being really soft, but I've just always felt so bored by her. But you're totally right, it's her stage presence. Or rather her complete lack thereof. The other girls of 4minute have huge personalities and take charge of the stage so well. Jihyun always ends up kind of just blending in with the back up dancers. Especially with Crazy and how much was going on onstage she totally just gets completely lost.   Part of me thinks that's just her personality. She prefers to be the quiet leader who supports her fellow members and just doesn't care about the spotlight. I don't know her personally, and I haven't followed the group long enough to really make a solid judgment on the matter but that's how it comes off to me. Sometimes leaders are best when they don't outshine everyone else. But in the same breath, I have always thought Onew from SHINee was one of those quieter leaders who does the support role in the group well, yet he shines just as much as the others on stage."
kpopslumberparty,382s09,youhadmeathelo,2,Tue Jun 2 08:34:25 2015 UTC,"I don't watch too many live performances aside from Beast or BTOB, so if that's the case, she's really wasting the fame that 4Minute has right now. Strange she'd be assigned leader, especially if she lacks stage presence (at least for Crazy? which demands a lot of pizazz). At least try to make up the lack of amazing vocals/dancing with a bombing personality/performance.  One-liners should be like Hyoyeon; make the best out of the very few lines they get. Quality > Quantity!"
kpopslumberparty,382s09,immyongsoo,3,Tue Jun 2 02:52:53 2015 UTC,"That's why Hyo is my fave in Soshi. She's pretty much like, ""eff you SM, I'm still going to have the time of my life and dance my ass off even if no one cares about me."""
kpopslumberparty,382s09,unicornbottle,3,Tue Jun 2 03:22:52 2015 UTC,"I saw it in Bar Bar Bar, which Crayon Pop was promoting for forever.  Ellin only has one line in the song, ""gomindo no!"", and it came up a lot in Crayon Pop TV (season 2) that Ellin held on to that line with perverse pride. Any time the song would be playing in the background with all the other girls ignoring it, Ellin would sing along to her line and then the CEO would write something over top with ""Ellin never misses her line kekeke"" when editing the video.  At 21:05 of this CPTV episode you can see Ellin cheerfully reciting her line and then Soyul coming along and making fun of her.  I should say Ellin's made a lot of progress. Fans (at least on reddit) were more or less completely shocked when Uh-Ee came out and Ellin had, like, actual substantial solo lines in it. Not that everyone has to. Not everyone in a kpop group has to be a vocalist, you know. If you do want to be a vocalist, I think there are opportunities to train more with the agency's vocal coaches, though."

kpopslumberparty,37u24q,ladauphine,10,Sat May 30 11:44:30 2015 UTC,"This is so incredibly perfect.  SM couldn't decide if they wanted to make the boys look younger or older. So, they just said fuck it, and threw this awful mix of ""old man going to bingo night"" and ""mom dressed me like this for school picture day"" at them.   Look at Taemin's face. He knows.   Bless whoever made this. It made this styling 100% better."
kpopslumberparty,37u24q,youhadmeathelo,4,Sat May 30 16:49:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's kind of unfortunate. I like the general direction of the styling in terms of vibe but I feel like they made the worst outfit choices to go along with it."
kpopslumberparty,37u24q,VariantIN,2,Sat May 30 22:30:41 2015 UTC,"View has such an awesome ""lazy summer"" kind of vibe, but is still vibrant at the same time. It's kind of like they were trying to go for that college-aged summer break feel. And that would have been amazing.  Especially since SHINee is the right age to fit this.   They even mention while talking about the concept for the MV that they wanted it to be about something more relevant to where they were at in their lives. And they totally should be presenting themselves like that.   However, ""lazy summer college vibe"" does not equate to ""dressing myself in the dark in grandpa's closet."" Apparently SM's stylists have absolutely no idea what normal men their age wear. If they styled everyone closer to Jonghyun, this would have made so much more sense."

But damn, it has grown on me. So. Much. It's a really slick song. Props to Jonghyun! I can't speak Korean, so I can't judge the quality of how the lyrics are composed, but from the english subs I love how clever it is. Subtle, but grown up. Beautiful.   And then the choreography. It seems a little underwhelming for SHINee at first, but it's so smooth it's hard not to fall in love. It's nice to see them doing something more laid back that they can have fun with."

kpopslumberparty,37k1tr,iampotato_worshipme,3,Thu May 28 05:37:52 2015 UTC,"I feel as though SM feels confident with EXO lately as well. Even with the leave of KrisHan, EXO won the most music show trophies with this comeback. Also somebody mentioned that since Yunho is off to the military, SM is losing their biggest revenue group (TVXQ) and needs to make up for it somehow, aka this is where EXO comes in."
kpopslumberparty,37k1tr,pinkpanda09,10,Fri May 29 05:23:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're intentionally trying to start fanwars. I mean, they're inevitably going to happen. But honestly I just think that they're having the comeback in June because SM has been overlapping their artists' promotions like crazy this year."
kpopslumberparty,37k1tr,followthesound,12,Thu May 28 04:56:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if anything I think Big Bang is the one trying to start shit with everyone. A comeback every month? really? They're literally trying to hog the charts for months and I think it's super unfair to newer groups who would like to try and reach number one.  Exo is huge so they'll be fine, but the smaller groups must be pissed."
kpopslumberparty,37k1tr,silversam,6,Thu May 28 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like this might be their last pre-military group comeback, and are making the most of it."

kpopslumberparty,377vkg,majekmistake,5,Mon May 25 16:45:15 2015 UTC,K.Will's backup dancers dressing up differently each time for Day 1!  My personal favorite is this one bc the dance for the chorus becomes 10x funnier.
kpopslumberparty,377vkg,dongledongs,6,Mon May 25 17:22:07 2015 UTC,"I love when groups reference other groups, like with Shy Boy.  I know with T-ara's Roly Poly lives they would always throw in other choreo during the dance break at the end.  Another group that did this was Mamamoo with Piano Man, as well as ad-libbing. ""AoA, let's do a colab."" and similar. (Apink, AoA)  Similar when GD referenced SNSD, though it's in the lyrics too so it's more planned. He's done similar before too. (""My name is gee gee gee gee baby baby baby, GD GD baby baby baby."")  Edit: Another unrelated thing I love is with BAP during Warrior they would ""shoot"" one member at the end and it always changed. It was a nice add on. They did something similar with Crash where they played rock paper scissors and gave piggy backs based on who won."

It seems to be the song that everyone points to as their iconic hit, but it just sounds  like a complete mess to me. Every member's part sounds like it's in a different key, the realistic heartbeat sound in the background throws off the rhythm,  and the chorus is all together underwhelming. The dance is awesome, but for me that's all it has going for it."

They just sound so...zappy and there's a lot of autotune and when you look back at it it really doesn't age well."
kpopslumberparty,371v8h,dongledongs,2,Sun May 24 11:58:30 2015 UTC,2009 was definitely the year of autotune and G-Dragon's Heartbreaker promos didn't help! Everyone jumped on that bandwagon.
kpopslumberparty,371v8h,fangirl101,11,Fri May 29 19:47:05 2015 UTC,"I think that a lot of SHINee fans like Ring Ding Dong but I just despise it as a song, it's just the incarnation of autotune.  But if we talk the other way around, I love Wolf as a song. Everyone hates it or just finds it weird but I like it because it's so different, the fast rapping is just so good."
kpopslumberparty,371v8h,Equilibriumx,3,Sun May 24 10:13:16 2015 UTC,"SHINee is totally my biggest bias too, and I think Ring Ding Dong is awful. The autotune is so cringy. Especially since all of the boys can sing so, so well. On top of that, it really just doesn't have any of the qualities that make every one of their other songs so amazing.   And I also feel the same way about Wolf. It's really catchy, and even though the literal wolf thing was cheesy, the choreography is fun. Though, the lyrics (at least how they read translated into English) are so, so bad. Maybe they aren't so bad in Korean?"
kpopslumberparty,371v8h,youhadmeathelo,3,Sun May 24 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Wolf is just really catchy as a song if you don't understand Korean.

kpopslumberparty,371v8h,ayemies,3,Sun May 24 03:50:29 2015 UTC,"Catallena is an acquired taste, in my opinion. I was really weirded out the first time I saw it and I had to watch it over and over many times until I actually liked the song. As for Bar Bar Bar, I wouldn't really be able to relate to you since I immediately fell in love with the song and it was the song that made me a fan of Crayon Pop.  EDIT: spelling"

I can understand why other people like it, but the only part of it that I like is the super electronic-y instrumental bit at 0:27 (and various other times throughout the song).

kpopslumberparty,371v8h,minniewheats,6,Sun May 24 08:39:53 2015 UTC,"Seems like a lot of Reddit like this song, but I'll have to go with Crazy by 4Minute. It's pretty simple why I don't like the song and that is because I just don't like that kind of hip-hoppy song and I'm not too big on rap. The song itself overall is pretty good, but I myself just don't like it.  First, c'mon, the weird English opening again? Female monster? Leggo? It's just not my thing. This goes for any kpop songs with some English dialogue in the beginning, especially when it's broken English. It can be extremely cringey.  There is probably only 20% of singing in the song (I don't really count ""미미 미친 것처럼 이미 미친 것처럼"" chorus part as singing) and Jihyun's singing part felt kind of off in comparison to the whole song. I do enjoy Gayoon and Seohyun's singing parts, though.  This is super super super tiny, but it bothers me when Jiyoon puts stress on ""sip"" in ""gossip."" This isn't the deal breaker for me not liking this song, but little things can make a difference. ((Side track: I'm a huge fan of Beast and there isn't a song that I dislike, but I tend to skip Lightless sometimes only because of the fact that Yoseob doesn't pronounce the ""s"" in ""lightless"" the second time they sing the chorus. Stupid, I know, and I very much like that song, but just one little pronunciation can really bother me))  Thirdly, I really dislike Hyuna's makeup in this. She can look better than that. Her hair and the makeup just looks really weird. It might be just me, since I don't use makeup myself, but she looked better in other MVs. I think she used too much makeup in this MV.  But I digress, since this question is about the song and not the MV (or else I'd have a bit more to say). I love CUBE and I like 4Minute, but this song is just bleh for me.  But really, most answers to the why part of this question would simply be that it's not their style or it doesn't resonate with them. I can't get into EXO because they're just not my style. I tried listening to multiple songs, but again, the answer's simple: Not my style. Wolf is my favourite though.   just kidding it's so weird, and yes, I know this is the unspoken song of EXO"

I love Hello Couselor, but most idols don't really get a chance to say much, so not that...  EXO on Running Man was fabulous for me - the facial expressions and how intense they got was glorious. Weekly Idol for most groups is great, but I really like their thing they did with Big Byung (Hitmaker!).  EXO backstage with Ivy and Ailee on Immortal Song in 2013.. Weird cut, but some great interaction, and I feel like Ivy embodies us all if Kai were to dance for us.  I like individual reality shows as well, like Hello Baby with SHINee, SHINee's One Fine day, honestly anything with Mblaq in it because while I'm not a huge fan of them generally, any variety they do is gold.  There was also a YG special 2 years ago I think Strong Heart, the last episode before Lee Seunggi left, and I really enjoyed that. Bingu TOP and Se7en omg. And YG Family Dance Battle (sorry for LQ, can't find HQ clip).  Also, on VIXX's Mydol (the elimination show that decided on VIXX's lineup), MBLAQ came in for part of episode 7 and I couldn't stop laughing.  EDIT: Added links"

kpopslumberparty,36ujj9,thenerdal,8,Fri May 22 06:15:25 2015 UTC,"I skimmed his AMAs again  To be honest, I actually think the guy is legit but he went too far.  He shouldn't had posted his ""proof"", everyone believed him anyway.   We think it's all cool but I think what most of us forget is that he could get some huge shit from SM if he breached anything on the supposed contract  His answers seemed too real to be phony, as someone on the other thread already said, you could feel his envy on Yeri.   He didn't discuss every idol in extreme detail like the actual trainee phonies, he stayed away from idol questions and he didn't even seem to be a kpop fan himself lol  No sugarcoating, just the plain hard ""truth"" about being a trainee what just seems too real to be thought out.  People wanted too much juice he couldn't provide and he bailed out, gg reddit Kappa  Apparently he's getting interviewed soon by some site so I look forward to that  Also @oniontaker tweeted that they indeed let go some of the guy trainees over there recently  Idk man this is definitely interesting"

kpopslumberparty,36ujj9,NewbieSone,6,Fri May 22 09:00:33 2015 UTC,"I think he's legit. He did seem very detailed and realistic about his training. However, I think he underestimated how big it could get, and didn't expect it to be linked everywhere.   I suppose he took it down for safety reasons."
kpopslumberparty,36ujj9,Equilibriumx,6,Fri May 22 09:31:35 2015 UTC,"I think he was a phony as well. Why? Mainly because he posted shitty proof that didn't seem legit at all (e.g. signature on the first page, no signature by parents eventhough they legally were his guardians, no signature by sm represantative). If he was legit he would have known that this would not prove anything (even if we assume the contract is legit...it didn't look legit at all) but the posted it anyway. He also didn't post it to the old thread but made a new post. That is also a sign of attention-seeking. He also answered 100s of questions (possibly every single one), another indicator of attention seeking that seems a bit excessive.  This makes me think he was desperate to be taken seriously and prove that he was not a phony. He would not care if people believed him to that degree if he really was a former trainee. He used a throwaway, he could have just not cared if people not believed him and walked away from the whole thing.   TLDR: I guess I'm being an armchair psychologist over this but people who lie are generally much more concerned about if you believe them than people who are telling the truth even if they are saying the same thing. Providing flimsy ""evidence"" that objectively doesn't convince anybody is much more likely to be done by somebody that is lying. Somebody who tells the truth and only had the same shady contract thing left most likely would go more with ""I only have this crappy contract left that doesn't proof anything, sorry"" and would not even have posted it.  EDIT: First time I'm getting downvoted for just explaining the reasoning behind my opinion on this sub? It's my opinion. Not like we will ever know one way or the other."
kpopslumberparty,36ujj9,starcomestrue,4,Fri May 22 11:00:52 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%. Also other incongruences, like acting blasé about kpop but then bringing up CLC repeatedly. It just all felt mildy fannish. I also agree a real poster would have just ignored some things instead of seizing every opportunity to try and establish cred by pointing out limits of his knowledge. It was just too much effort to establish a narrative, as if it was crystalizing in response to the questions - people who live with facts mentally filter much more because they take them for granted.  In short: I don't buy it."

kpopslumberparty,36p2bm,PottersPhoenix,3,Fri May 22 14:00:25 2015 UTC,I think I'm pretty much the opposite of a nugu fan in general. Not because they're nugus but just because their comebacks/songs are usually (!!) pretty low effort und unoriginal. I feel like a lot of them just take whatever other groups are having success with and executing it in a cheap way (mainly because they lack ressources I imagine). I'm willing to change my opinion on this though...shoot some nugu goodness my way and convince me.

I hadn't heard of this group before, but coincidentally I was watching the 2014 Hallyu Dream Festival last night and using it an opportunity to practice my hangul, and they were on it. At the beginning of a group's act, they'd show their hangul name on screen, and then at the end they'd show it again in English, so I could make sure I got it right.  Anyway, F.Cuz came on and I was trying to make sense of the hangul and I was like ""...Pokujeu? What the fuck is Pokujeu?"" and then I saw ""F.Cuz"" and thought I'd just completely butchered it.

Obviously I don't want actual figures or anything, more just like, is it half? Three quarters? Do you make enough doing your job to spend as much as you'd like to on SHINee? What do you think of the new album?!! How long do you think you'll stay in Korea? Do you want to stay permanently?"
kpopslumberparty,36magm,_cornflake,6,Wed May 20 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"I see you /u/cornflake, asking the hard questions!!  1:   During promotions- Aside from work/sleeping/cat cuddles pretty much all of it. It is an extremely time consuming hobby. If you aren't directly doing fangirl stuff then you're doing other things to make life easier when you do the fangirl activities.  Between promotions- I live a pretty normal life outside of promotions. I still spend a good amount of time on SHINee, but a lot of that is cause the majority of my friend group here are just as hardcore Shawols. But mostly I don't do too much of anything between promotions.  2: Strangely enough they are weirdly supportive. They think I'm fucking weird for it, but they say that they never expected any sort of normal life for me. My mom even follows SHINee on Kakao to help her keep up with whats going on in my life. I'm really grateful to them.  3: Outside of promotions I'd say its like 1/4 of my income. But during promotions I pretty much immediately pay all my bills, buy cat food and then the rest goes toward SHINee. Be that in the form of buying tickets/merch or just in the form of paying to get my ass to and from music shows and grabbing some food in between. It's difficult cause I'm a bit of a collector so I spend a lot more than I should so I can have full ot5 sets of things (thank god there are only 5 of them, I'd be boned if it was like EXO or Suju or someone).  4: HNNNNNGGGG It is so damn good!!! I'm dying to see Trigger, Alive and Odd Eye performed live as I've seen a lot of the others now and they're gorgeous. I am so happy that this album is so damn high quality, everything from the songs themselves to the MV, styling, and physical album production. It is a gorgeous album and the poster is HUGE. I'm in love with View so I'll be happy to see it live a zillion and twelve times.  5: Right now the plan is as such: stay in Korea until SHINee start their military stints. Then go back to the states to get a masters, probably in cultural linguistics then after I finish that I'll probably come back to Korea. Not necessarily because of SHINee (though that will definitely be a major draw in) but because I really do love living in Seoul. I feel alive here. I love all of the things I can do and see  here. All of the shopping and food and god bless I even love the public transportation. Seoul is fantastic and I just don't want to downgrade my life by going back to the States. There is literally no where comparable in the USA."
kpopslumberparty,36magm,_cornflake,4,Wed May 20 22:11:46 2015 UTC,"<3  Has there been any speculation on when SHINee will start to go for military service? Onew is... 27 in Korean age, right? Does it seem like they'll wait until they absolutely have to go before they enlist? Is that what most SM guys do?"
kpopslumberparty,36magm,_cornflake,3,Wed May 20 22:18:23 2015 UTC,I believe they go by international age for final enlistment date. We suspect 2018/2019 to be the years of sadness but no one really knows.
kpopslumberparty,36magm,SifuMelonLord,2,Wed May 20 22:25:12 2015 UTC,"Ohh I didn't know they did it by international age. I guess SHINee will do staggered enlistments, right? To me it would actually make more sense to have the whole group go at once, get it over with and then bring them back after say 2 years, but I guess the companies want to carry on making money from solos :/   Do you think you could do your masters in Korea? Are there international universities or courses in English, or is it all done in Korean?"
kpopslumberparty,36magm,SifuMelonLord,3,Thu May 21 16:06:21 2015 UTC,I spend a lot more than I should so I can have full ot5 sets of things   you gotta show us your SHINee merch collection!
kpopslumberparty,36magm,yvvno,7,Thu May 21 04:47:34 2015 UTC,"Omfg it's INSANE. I LITERALLY only own SHINee stuff (except Red Light and a suju m album I use as a coaster cause I wanted to go to a Zhou Mi recording with a friend).   I own posters, albums, photo books, pillows, blankets, bags, pins, jewelry, shirts, photocards, and a bunch of random ass shit like a travel toiletries kit, magnets, and a fucking tarot card deck.   I don't even have all of the posters I own up. I have doubles and triples of certain thing. I have 12 fucking copies of BASE, six to keep  (two display copies, three signed copies, and my promotions copy that is hella beaten up) and six I'm still pawning off on anyone who will take one.   I call it... My SHRINee."
kpopslumberparty,36magm,SifuMelonLord,6,Thu May 21 07:00:56 2015 UTC,a suju m album I use as a coaster   LOL    I have a SHRINee that I pray towards too but it just consists of a dream girl poster so same same    is most of your merch from concert merch booths?  have you bought stuff from the atrium? because all I know of the atrium goods is that it's just random shit the idols like. like on Jonghyun's 4 things show he was just smelling individual shinee candles.    travel toiletries kit     that's fucking amazing and I aspire to reach this level of shawol dedication.   tarot card deck   is this an official thing? or is it fanmade like this? is the death card a picture of taemin?? do you do shinee tarot readings??? I have so many questions
kpopslumberparty,36magm,followthesound,8,Thu May 21 07:41:33 2015 UTC,"I once threw the suju album at my cat cause she was trying to gnaw on a picture of Minho. My cat comes from a long line of Shawol cats and bears an appropriate name. But for being named after Onew and owned by a Jonghyun bias and she is a total Minho girl. Always goes after my Minho merch.  My SHRINee is large and intense enough that I literally don't allow non-kpoppers into my apartment.And preferably only Shawols. I made my coworkers pee at the local subway rather than let them into my apartment once. They know too much as it is.  Nooo the concert merch stuff is actually quite a miniscule part of it.  I've only been to two concerts after all, SWC4 and Tokyo Dome. Most of my stuff is from either the Everysing store near Myeongdong or SM Coex Artium. While the Coex shop definitely does have a lot of useless stuff they also have plenty of fan goods as well as some cool random shit. Like the majority of my earring collection is stuff Coex sells because they are pieces that Jonghyun Key and Taemin have worn (and if you've ever looked at their ears you'll know they have INCREDIBLE earrings).   Also those SHINee candles are kind of special. Those are candles that Key had originally ordered from Soohyun Candles in Itaewon as gifts to the members, based on which scents reminded him of which members. They all smell absolutely divine. Taemin is Champagne Supernova, Key is Peppermint, Jonghyun is Cederwood, Minho is Magic Wood and Onew is Rain. Something like that. God I think I actually remembered those exactly, jfc.  They sell the toiletry kit at Coex. There are ones for other groups too. There are also Why So Serious oil blotting papers. Like for when your face gets sweaty. I do not own those.  Um its not official but its not fan made either. You can get them in the little kpop shops in Myeongdong. These are places that you can get wall scrolls, clocks, little cardboard standees, random postcard pics, playing cards, just about anything. I think Jonghyun was death too. But I'm not sure.   I do not... yet. I actually am working with a lovely Shawol fanartist to custom make a tarot deck.  edit: So i checked the Tarot deck and yep, Taeminnie is Death. With this picture too! I can only hope death looks like that when it comes for me..."
kpopslumberparty,36magm,followthesound,2,Thu May 21 11:01:47 2015 UTC,what. is. that. tarot card
kpopslumberparty,36magm,followthesound,1 point,Thu May 21 19:25:32 2015 UTC,late reply sorry! this person made a couple of shinee tarot cards which I saw on tumblr a while ago which I thought were pretty bomb. apparently they're planning to make a full set of 22
kpopslumberparty,36magm,bryanxdinh,2,Mon May 25 22:49:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry to barge in here, haha, but this is just such a weird coincidence - I'm also a huge Shawol, and a linguist with a serious interest in cultural linguistics who's hoping to move to Seoul after graduation! Crazy."
kpopslumberparty,36magm,kitchenmaniac111,6,Thu May 21 03:14:24 2015 UTC,"DOOO IIITTTT.   Seriously. Easily the best decision I have ever  made in my life.   You know how when you're in high school you think ""well when I get to college, then my life will really start"" well sometime in college most people realize that's not how the world works and that if they want to truly live their life they have to do it on their own in the now. I had that moment too, but then I moved to Seoul. And then my life truly started.   Thanks to SHINee and my undying love for them and their influence I have improved myself and my life so much. I am a better me because of them. I think that is why I love them as much as I do.   And beyond the SHINee aspect living in Seoul is just da bomb on its own. You're never bored. The city is super safe and super cheap. I go and buy a liter of alcohol plus some mixers for about 5 bucks at the local convenience store then walk down to the Han river at night and get fucking smashed and walk home without ever once being harassed. Literally the most interaction I get is when I get so drunk that I start blasting and singing SHINee songs on the river. I  fear I may end up on a viral video sometime..."
kpopslumberparty,36magm,unicornbottle,2,Thu May 21 08:10:51 2015 UTC,"I'm already planning to spend a semester (September - December 2016) in Seoul doing Yonsei University's language program, and you're making me even more excited than I already was! I figure if I really enjoy the semester, I'll make the move after I graduate. :D I'm also really hoping that SHINee have promotions or a concert while I'm there. c:"
kpopslumberparty,36magm,unicornbottle,2,Thu May 21 23:37:19 2015 UTC,Fingers crossed for you. I'm sure you will love it here. I should still be here by then so we should meet up haha!
kpopslumberparty,36kw2l,funwithgoats,16,Wed May 20 03:24:08 2015 UTC,"My all-time favourite group is SHINee. I love them because they always release very high quality and diverse music, and their dynamic as a vocal unit is so awesome. I'm gonna try to narrow down my playlist of favourite SHINee songs (which is like 50 songs long, haha) and leave out most of their title tracks (since they're a pretty well-known group) in order to make sure the list isn't ridiculously long:   Odd Eye (which came out just a couple days on their brand new album!) Symptoms (widely regarded by SHINee fans as one of the best songs SHINee's ever released) One Minute Back Dream Girl (my all time favourite SHINee title track) Spoiler Punch Drunk Love Up and Down JoJo Orgel Like a Fire Picasso"
kpopslumberparty,36kw2l,followthesound,4,Wed May 20 06:07:01 2015 UTC,"Excellent list!! You included my three favorite songs (Symptoms, Like a Fire, and Orgel)!!  I am also going to suggest the following:  * Moon River Waltz- live version for dat high note Jonghyun has at 3:15. It's much better than the recorded version. It's like he ripped that note from the core of his soul. Dayum.   Burning Up- pls ignore the clothes. I'm not sure why Key allowed this to happen. Mono-Drama- Jonghyun solo where he is singing about how his fans feel about him cause he is a goddamn stalker on twitter from our perspective. Honestly it is kind of painful reading the lyrics while listening to this song, it hits pretty close to home. One For Me (written by Wheesung and is probably my fourth favorite SHINee song tbh, its just so fucking good) Quasimodo (allow Jonghyun to DESTROY you at about 3:05-3:20)   I wonder how deep OP is wanting to delve into these bands cause I'm sure you and I could send her down the SHINee rabbit hole beyond just songs if she really wants to play that game."
kpopslumberparty,36kw2l,ladauphine,4,Wed May 20 12:27:05 2015 UTC,Odd Eye is one of THE best kpop songs out there.
kpopslumberparty,36kw2l,kittenmittons,4,Wed May 20 15:51:54 2015 UTC,I'm just going to add that Dream Girl is my all time favorite k-pop song. The performances for this song were amazing!!!!
kpopslumberparty,36kw2l,jsalad,1 point,Wed May 20 21:14:07 2015 UTC,I'm always blown away by the performance where Minho's mic stand breaks and they just carry on and adjust so well that you barely notice that one of their props is broken!
kpopslumberparty,36kw2l,followthesound,7,Thu May 21 04:36:51 2015 UTC,"They are not my favourite but latley i have been listening to beast alot, i only really know the title tracks though. My faves are * Mystery * Bad girl * Say no * Breath * Shadow * Fiction * Shock * Good luck I like most of these songs because they are catchy songs with catchy dances, so if that's also your style you will probably enjoy them :) (it actually took me a whole year to bother to check out beast which i regret lol.) Also i would reccomend you make a profile on last.fm if you havent already. Its a good site for discovering new groups"
kpopslumberparty,36kw2l,RedBeluga,8,Wed May 20 04:18:56 2015 UTC,"VIXX is my favorite group! Random song recommendation (bc I seriously love them all..)-   Youth Hurts Love, LaLaLa On & On Eternity On A Cold Night Light Up The Darkness After Dark Someday Hyde And this isn't really VIXX but it features Leo, one of their members, and I'm hella biased so I'm gonna recommend it- Blossom Tears   Have fun!!"
kpopslumberparty,36kw2l,sprittany,3,Wed May 20 13:00:09 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite boy groups is Cross Gene.  Play With Me  La Di Da Di (debut song)  Shooting Star  I'm Not A Boy, Not Yet A Man  Amazing Bad Lady  Dirty Pop"
kpopslumberparty,36kw2l,cherryblossomfairy,5,Thu May 21 01:12:32 2015 UTC,"Heh, let me try and convert you to the wonderful world of Block B! They are 7 nerds who are weird, loud, ridiculous, fabulous, and have a weirdly strong bond. They've gone through scandal after scandal and have come out stronger every time. Here are some of my favourite songs:   Nalina is a jam, and includes the wonderful line ""I'm so groove, so speshur!"" Nillili Mambo is another one of my faves, although we don't talk about Zico's hair. This one gets me hyped up. Very Good assaults all your senses in the best way possible, and Taeil's (the main vocalist's) singing is gorgeous as per usual.  Her is their most recent release, and they went in a bit of a different direction for this one. It's fun and summery! No Joke is a song for the rapper line (P.O, Kyung and Zico) off their first album, and showcases their skillz. Be The Light is a more emotional song, showing a side of them we haven't seen before; it's different but still great, and Taeil's vocals give me chills every time. Conduct Zero is the latest release from their subunit, Bastarz, comprising of U-Kwon, P.O, and B-Bomb. This was an interesting one, as they decided the members of the subunit by drawing coloured balls from a box! P.O is definitely not a dancer and this is especially evident when paired with the the two main dancers, lol. It's a super fun track, though. U-Kwon gets to show off his rapping skills which he's been working on!   Now for the different members! Zico is the leader, he is 24 years old (second youngest) and is a rapper. He has two great mixtapes that show a bit of a different side to him – the underground rapper side. He writes and produces all of Block B's songs.  P.O is the maknae, one of the tallest, and is the one with the deep voice. He is a rapper, too, but in recent releases (like Her) he has been given a bit more of a singing role as well. He's the one with the crazy hair – so far he's had red for Very Good, purple for Jackpot, and pink for Her! He acts like a badass on stage but in reality he's a big puppy who giggles and smiles a lot.   Taeil is the lead vocalist. He's the oldest of the lot, also the shortest, and has a whole bunch of tattoos. The others jokingly call him thug hyung. He has an absolutely angelic voice, as showcased in his recent solo release, Shaking.   Next is Jaehyo, a vocalist. He is an ulzzang from Busan, and when he's not being totally fabulous on twitter, he's being peeled by the others. They constantly tease him, it's pretty hilarious! He doesn't have a lot of lines in Block B's songs, because Zico (who distributes the lines) is pretty strict with that kinda stuff, but he has improved a lot since debut.  U-Kwon is a vocalist and one of the two dancers (I'm going to be honest, dancing is not Block B's strength, U-Kwon and B-Bomb are the only two who are good at it). He rarely, speaks, he just smiles! Even his signature has a big grin on it.   B-Bomb is another vocalist and the other dancer. While U-Kwon is more explosive and loud in his movements, B-Bomb is more controlled and refined.  He runs a dance crew in his spare time!  Last but certainly not least is Kyung, who I would describe as the little shit of the band. He's always trolling the others (like suggesting he and Zico swap underwear...). He's the third rapper, and has a really unique voice – you can always pick it out in their songs.   Hope you enjoyed this effort post lmao :-)"
kpopslumberparty,36kw2l,cassiem321,2,Wed May 20 13:19:35 2015 UTC,"Well, your free day is probably over now, but I'm going to do this, anyways. Someone's already covered SHINee and you mentioned you like EXO and BTS, so I'm going to do Topp Dogg!  Do you like hip-hop? Do you like electro? Do you like loud noises and too many boys on stage? If yes, then Topp Dogg is the group for you! Don't worry about mixing up Topp Dogg with other groups - they always say their name at the beginning of their songs. And then again in their choruses. In fact, the entire chorus might just be their name.  I recommend watching the videos in the order I put them in:   Top Dog Everyone's favorite Topp Dogg jam. T-O-DOUBLE-P, D-O-DOUBLE-G! Easiest chorus to memorize and a great song to pump you up. I linked the dance practice version because I don't think the MV does justice at showcasing their energy. Annie Back to the old school! This is the least Topp Dogg-like Topp Dogg song, but I think it's good for a calmer, less electro oriented fan. Their most recent single is a throwback to 90s hip-hop and was released for their 1st anniversary since debut. Plus you get to see all their names! Arario Back to the Joseon Dynasty! Features traditional Korean instruments, clothes, and dances. Say It You probably won't be able to tell any of the members apart in this video, but the chorus is, once again, very easy to sing along with. Open the Door This is actually quite a melodic song wrapped in heavy synths. Playground A heavy, plodding song, but more sedate than their title tracks. Eschatology This is probably their ""brightest"" track besides Annie, even though the subject matter is quite grim."

kpopslumberparty,369y3z,alfredfjones,4,Sun May 17 16:53:14 2015 UTC,"WHEN IS THE VIEW MV BEING RELEASED? I can't deal with this suspense. My poor Shawol heart has already gone through so much this weekend, I know I'm going to be slain by the MV. But I still need it. From the teasers it looks like such a high quality production.   I really do love the album, you can see how hard they worked and how much heart they put into it. I think it turned out really solid. I know it's not for everybody, but personally I quite enjoy it. It's frustrating that they're coming out with the B version now, I already preordered version A but I like the poster for B so much better.   I also hope people don't complain too much about the choreo. I've been noticing for a while now that nothing SHINee seems to do is impressive enough for people. Even with Everybody. ""I know they're capable of so much more!"". Oh give me a break, they've more than proved themselves. Now I'd like them to focus on not getting hurt.   (Sorry, I clearly have a lot of feelings about this comeback right now)"
kpopslumberparty,369y3z,ladauphine,4,Mon May 18 12:12:33 2015 UTC,"Lol, Knowing how many SHINee fans frequent this Sub I have been waiting for someone to comment on it.     It definitely seems from the comments sections of, well, everywhere that SHINee fans are pretty intensely ready for the MV now lol."
kpopslumberparty,369y3z,alfredfjones,2,Mon May 18 12:24:53 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel any better the Version A poster is HUGE and looks utterly divine on the wall. It's super pretty and I thought I would like the second more, but the first one is so gorgeous I'm really really happy with it.  I also really adore the new MV. Ugh so good. And the fact that the girls are clearly Shawols with all those posters on the wall. I was afraid for a moment that they had sneaked into my apartment to film that bit cause that is exactly what my walls look like..."
kpopslumberparty,369y3z,ladauphine,2,Wed May 20 12:39:21 2015 UTC,"Hah, is it as big as the giant one included with Jonghyun's Base? If so I'll have to start rearranging my posters to find a space, my room is quickly approaching that level! I know I'm going to love this poster regardless, but the question is - Do I order version B as well? I heard it has a different photo book too... The only thing keeping me from impulse buying is the super slow and expensive shipping, but it might just be worth it for my SHINee boys."
kpopslumberparty,369y3z,linkedhorizon,2,Wed May 20 20:40:19 2015 UTC,"It is just as giant, and I believe the version B one will be as well.  YES YES YES ORDER VERSION B. Not only will it help SHINee chart but you know all the clown pictures? They will all be in that version. Version A has a lot more carefree sorts of pictures that tie in with the MV."

My first Meet & Greet took a little over a month to be processed and another month for it to arrive, which was well over 5-10 business days, but I guess it was because I live in Canada and it was shipped during the holiday season. Just like you, I also ordered Crayon Pop's FM from Mwave Meet & Greet and this time around, it seems like it's going to arrive faster because I already received an email saying that my order has been shipped.

EXID is scheduled for May 25 - May 29, so you should receive an email about your order being shipped within the next two weeks."

TOP and Taeyang, if we're talking about members (yeah no sorry I can't choose between them, they're on the exact same level of bias... ness? lol).   BUT.  Then BTS happened. About 2 weeks ago. I started really deeply following them even before their recent comeback and after that it became even worse. They quickly jumped to the second place of my bias groups list (previously occupied by VIXX).  Don't get me wrong - at the moment it's my Bae Baes, then huge gap, then BTS, then another gap and other groups. And I hope it stays like that until whenever.  BUT.  Still. If there exists one group that, anytime in the future, will be able to replace my Losers, it's definitely BTS.

The promotion for War of Hormone is what converted me to the cult, I kept on watching their stages and all of them were so fun and sexy and perfect. Then like everyone else I found my way to the Bangtan Bombs aaand... You're in the ARMY now, oh-oo-oh you're in the army now~  GD's still my ultimate bias (I blame it on his adorable smile) but if I had to give a name for someone who could in the future threaten that position, then...

When I started liking SHINee, I was a major Minho fan (god bless the prince) because of Hello Baby but Jonghyun's sweet serenading and sweet smile and sweet eyes just got to me. When he sang the acoustic version of Lucifer on Beatles Code, I was smitten and it solidified him as my ULTIMATE BIAS. Ever since, I've been a die-hard Jonghyun fan even though I love all SHINee members so much  Then one fine day (Shawols, who gets the pun? lol) I came across GOT7 because of Jackson from roommate. After watching them sing Mr. Chu some part of me fell in love with Jr.'s honey voice. He was so masculine even though he was singing a song by Apink. After finding out more and more about him, I was seriously addicted to him. Pann choa articles about Jr. made me in love. Jr.'s side profile is no joke. Jonghyun was left on the back burner a bit.  But then, Jonghyun's solo promotions. Oh boy. LORD SOLO PROMOTIONS. AND WATCHING FANCAMS OF JJONGIE BEING CUTE ON BLUE NIGHT AHHHH CAN'T TAKE IT. I distinctively started to remember why I stanned Jonghyun so much. Nothing can take my love away from him now.  So in the end, Jjongie reclaimed his rightful throne. But Jr. is my side chick HAHAHAHAHA."

But seriously, when UNIQ debuted I did a double take too, but it was for Seungyeon. I'd be milling through my bias list and his cute little crooked-toothed mug would pop up and I'd be like, ""It's very crowded in here already, but I can't say no to that face.""  As for the question of who's usurping my bias throne, my answer is LEGEND's Listen. My ultimate bias of all time is Park Jeesu aka KIXS, but he is very closely followed by EXO's Chen. Those two have spent years carving out a niche in my heart and making themselves comfortable by releasing amazing music and being awesome, talented people and then Listen swoops in and over the promotions for his nugu groups first two songs, he's shot to the top of the list. Sure, he's handsome and super talented and seems like a nice guy, but it was his bucket list answer being that he wants to volunteer at an animal shelter and spend time helping homeless puppies that sealed the deal for me. Also, we share a birthday and I'm currently living like 15 minutes from his hometown so I feel like fate is kinda forcing him on me as well."

The lower part of the pants is too tight especially for those shoes, but you can see how an older style suit look compared to a younger one. Make sure your pants aren't too long because that will make you look short and if you do wear shorter pants it's even more important to make sure they're not too tight or too loose.  Go to a tailor and have good posture."

Their Kpop Music Mondays were a highlight of my week, and I would battle on their forums for my biases.    They slowed down on the KMM a lot, and complained about how hard they were, but when they came out, I and a lot of EYK fans were there. And of course I got into them as a couple, and watched all of their other videos also.    After they ran the indiegogo campaign for the studio, I figured the KMM problem was over. That they would hire some people, and things would get better. But after the studio, the pretty much cut Kpop out of their operation. They said KMM weren't even their most popular videos (TL;DRs are), but I mean... almost all the Kpop fans were watching those videos. It's insane to imagine that Kpop Music Monday wasn't a big part of their success and they just... kind of... killed it. They did fewer and fewer until recently, when they released a trailer for their channel, kpop wasn't even in it. It just looks like they're used their early popularity to build a business where they can go on vacation after vacation and film it and fund more and more traveling.    I don't like how much hate they've always gotten -- I don't hate them, I don't even dislike them, I'm just... I'm really disappointed. It's a big loss. There's literally no one else doing that.    And I'm grateful for what we had, when we had it, but I just... can't enjoy EYK videos any more. Every time they put up another video of a weeks-long ""tour"" of some new country I just feel... let down. I'm glad they're happy, I really am. And I want them to keep being happy.

They used to say how Kpop allowed them to connect with their students when they were teachers, and I became a fan from their KMM. Yet they never mention Kpop, the thing that helped them create and connect with their fan base. I thought they were really genuine and only doing videos for fun. Today, their videos are mostly about their travels and many serious topics (which should be discussed, but I don't think that EYK were ever the people to talk about such serious issues in TL;DRs when they started doing YouTube). I still enjoy them and I do like Leigh and Soozee, but I just feel like new EYK and old EYK aren't the same. I really miss the cheesy skits and production, which they promised would still remain even after hiring staff, but all of that is slowly fading out. I completely understand how you feel."
kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,sbps1,4,Tue May 12 22:47:56 2015 UTC,"I was actually just thinking about that the other day. I'm sure they do have fans who are just interested in Korea and Korean culture but I feel like a vast majority of their regular fans are kpop fans who like hearing them talk about kpop and idols and I also noticed that they haven't really been doing anything kpop related recently. I mean, it's their channel and they've got every right to do what they want with it, but it kinda feels like they're just trying to quietly move away from kpop while hoping nobody notices or acknowledges it, which is understandably a disappointing for long-time fans."
kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,majekmistake,2,Wed May 13 13:45:50 2015 UTC,Are they still doing those embarrassing 'interviews' with kpop artists? Or did they give that up after the mess with the SHINee segment?
kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,_cornflake,1 point,Wed May 13 14:37:12 2015 UTC,You're not the only one. When they turned off full RSS feed that's when I knew things were going downhill. I definitely saw an attitude change after they got their studio. I suppose money got to them but either way I unsubscribed and moved on.

kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,autourbanbot,1 point,Wed May 13 02:49:44 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of 4D :      It is a korean slang word which means someone who is eccentric and wacky. It is not a word meant to insult a person, instead it is something which is used to complement him/her.  This is most commonly used to describe Korean celebrities with a strong personality. It may also be used to indicate that a person has a very strong individuality or a unique personality.  This is derived from ordinary people being ""3d"", so a person which is so quirky and thinks outside the box is considered ""4d"" or 4-dimensional.     Victoria is so 4D! She acts like a kid and yet she dresses up gorgeous! jjang!  I knew my friend was 4D! She always introduces out-of-this-world topics.  Daebak!

When I figured out that he was the same guy who beat up his gf, I was shocked. I wanted to re-watch the drama without subs to practise my Korean, but now I don't even think I can look at him for an hour at a time."
kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,hyunmins,2,Tue May 12 17:24:46 2015 UTC,This is exactly me tbh :\ Hyunjoong was my first ultimate bias who I actually got to know past his face and kept up with/watched varieties of etc. so I always had a weak spot for him and even now I still kinda consider myself a Triple S...  But honestly after everything I can't even look at Hyunjoong. The more news I hear about the whole situation the more incredibly disgusted (and very very angry as a past fan) I feel.

He tries too hard to be funny and it's really just annoying whenever he does his 'reaction king'  bs. I get how others like him (fan service,  funny, etc) but I just see him as a kid who tries overly hard to appeal to the audience which is a turnoff for me.

On a more positive note, I'm liking Baekhyun more and more as time passes... he's calmed down a lot (I think the thing that happened last year made him mature a bit), but he's kept all of the factors that make him appealing. In my eyes, he keeps getting sweeter and sweeter for so many different reasons :3"
kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,Uanaka,6,Tue May 12 17:21:10 2015 UTC,"I used to love exo and I still do, but in a different way, and now I have a twisted opinion on basically every member lol."

kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,Uanaka,19,Wed May 13 07:16:16 2015 UTC,"I was pretty into 2PM when they first debuted, and I watched Wild Bunny obsessively in 2009 right up until the Jay Park controversy. Having been a huge fan of DBSK and knowing what kind of turmoil is caused by members leaving, I pretty much immediately distanced myself from the 2PM fandom when Jay left the group. I still listened to their music after that, and Heartbeat is still one of my favourite K-pop songs, but after their album 01:59 PM their music kind of started to go in a direction that didn't match with my tastes.   Super Junior was my first K-pop group, back when I discovered the genre in 2008. I was a huuuuge fan of them, but after Han Geng (my favourite member) left, and other members got themselves into plenty of controversies (Kangin's drunken hit and run, Yesung's ""fat girls are lazy"" comment, Shindong's ""it's okay for guys to be fat but girls have to be skinny"" comment, Leeteuk's ""Suzy needs to lose weight"" comment, Siwon's homophobia), I couldn't be bothered to keep up with them anymore. It's sad, because I still really like the other members, but as a queer fat girl, I kind of feel like I've been indirectly forced out of the fandom by some of the members of Super Junior themselves."
kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,followthesound,1 point,Tue May 12 19:54:32 2015 UTC,"Super Junior is a bit iffy, sure they pioneered the second generation of k-pop, but I've kinda pushed them aside too. But with 2pm, i'm sure you've kept up with them, but A.D.T.O.Y, was an amazingly lovely song. I don't remember which album it was released in, but at least catch up to that point. Go Crazy was a miss with me, but I do love Jun K.'s other works, especially his solo ""True Swag"" .... 'nuf said."

The reason why I am no longer a fan of both of them is because I started to get into K-hiphhop (I like both K-hiphop and Kpop.) The more I got into K-hiphop, I just started losing interest in both of them. I started listening to more and more underground rappers (Jolly V, Choi Sam, Simon D to name a few) and CL and G-Dragon are just no longer unique to me."
kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,Uanaka,3,Tue May 12 17:38:38 2015 UTC,"I get you.  I personally love both. Is GD the best writer ever? No. But damnit, I love what he does. Is CL the best female rapper? Nope. But I love the way she raps.   I'm fickle, though. Sometimes all I have to do is like how a rapper sounds. Sometimes I need to know who the rapper is. Idols or underground or mainstream, you know? There are some names people always throw out, and I'm not really feeling them. But some I love."

Sure he's a pretty great producer and he's written a lot, but other than that, meh? CL on the other hand, I just have this undying attraction for her, it's not that I think that she's the shit, (well she was my queen for a while) but honestly, I'm going to base my continued fan-ship for 2ne1 depending on CL's american debut. I wish her luck, but if it flops, 2ne1 flops. And I move onto to supremely fanboy .... iKON."

kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,unicornbottle,7,Tue May 12 16:59:51 2015 UTC,"I have a tendency to abandon groups once they have been established for a while and reached their peak. Once a group ""make it"", they just stop trying. Their activities decline, they stop going on variety shows, we basically see less of them. Even their performances stop being as good because they don't have that desperation to succeed anymore. I like my idols rookies and desperate to be seen everywhere.  Here's basically my progression of idols:   Phase 1: Suju, SNSD, FT Island Phase 2: Beast, Shinee, Infinite Phase 3: BAP, BTOB, EXO, GOT7, BTS"
kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,Uanaka,3,Tue May 12 18:37:42 2015 UTC,"I completely get you, as someone whose first kpop group was SNSD. I've actually felt that way about Apink recently. They are now at the peak, which is fantastic, and I hope they still have that ""hunger"" in them.   That's why one of my current favorite groups is EXID, because they are throwing themselves everywhere and giving it their 110%. They have yet to reach their peak and they know it, but they are slowly but surely climbing up the ladder."
kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,silversam,1 point,Wed May 13 14:50:48 2015 UTC,"I am the exact same way! With the same groups as well... Since there are so many groups now it is hard to wait forever for a group's comeback without finding other, more active groups to like instead."

Same with BTS... I can't comment much for BAP since i wasn't a big fan, and well Cube sucks even more at promotions for BTOB than JYP."

kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,pbdonut,9,Wed May 13 05:14:33 2015 UTC,"Wendy.  She was my bias in RV but after the whole black people impersonating that was kind of where I drew the line.  She's very bright and talented but that shit can be really hurtful to her fans and she should know better since she's from the west.  I usually look past ""problematic"" stuff cause it usually happened a long time ago and it's no longer relevant, but this was so recent that I can't defend it."
kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,unicornbottle,9,Wed May 13 13:35:06 2015 UTC,"SNSD. They were the group that introduced me to Kpop and I was obsessed with them, but I lost interest. After the Jessica controversy, I distanced myself from them more. I feel like the group is breaking up as the members pursue other activities and their music just doesn't affect me the same way their old stuff did. I will still give their new music a try but I am not a big fan of them anymore. I enjoy so many other groups that have some sort of uniqueness to them, while SNSD seems to just be a standard girl group that now just goes off of their reputation. No hate on SNSD, but I have moved on."
kpopslumberparty,35pc1i,pbdonut,4,Tue May 12 20:21:26 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. Their popularity lets them put less effort into their songs and still be a hit. Once I broke out of the ""SNSD is the best and the only k-pop group for me"" bubble which lasted for quite a while, I realized that their newer songs seem bland and boring to me compared to my current favorite groups' songs. In my opinion, there are songs out there that don't get as much recognition but are still way better than SNSD's songs. It's just a matter of finding the right groups.  There's also the fandom. As time went on, I realized that the fandom can be quite ""culty"". The amount of craziness such as sensitivity to criticisms aimed at the group, delusional beliefs (pairings, ""stay away from my unnie/noona!"", ""Jessica will come back one day""), and unnecessary worship (The guy on Youtube who freaks out in every SNSD reaction video who also has a culty following of his own is the worst) can be quite excessive. Of course, this may be just the vocal minority I'm observing.  I don't want to be associated with the fandom anymore for these reasons. I'll still listen to my favorite songs by them from time to time, but I'll never consider myself a fan of the group. I'm strictly a fan of just their music."

I'm usually not super into rappers but I fell really hard for Block B around the time Nanlina came out and I thought Zico was so charismatic and talented. My affections for him kinda waned when I started paying more attentions to the other members but I still really liked him. Then Tough Cookie came out and all that nonsense with the lyrics for it happened and it kinda soured my opinion on him. I still acknowledge that he's a talented guy, but I don't really pay attention to him unless the rest of Block B is with him nowadays."

But then two days ago the boys recorded for Hello Counselor and Abnormal Summit, and we were pretty damn sure at that point. I went through all of yesterday at work afraid to check twitter and kakao. The feels ran high when I finally saw the teaser with my Jinki baby.  There are so many rumors about what it could be from our super sleuth Sherlockin' Shawols and they all sound totally legit.

kpopslumberparty,35m4la,daebaeloser,8,Mon May 11 17:08:13 2015 UTC,"I know that girl IRL. At my college we have an anime/kpop/kdrama society/club thing. We had this group chat and she would say similar rude things about almost anything in the chat. Eventually she was removed from the chat and banned from the club. I wouldn't pay her too much attention. Tbh, she just seemed the kind of person who liked to hate on anything that others liked/was found popular. She always says that she ""hates exo and bigbang"" but her bag has exo and their logo printed on it and her pencil case is bigbang themed... idek.  Unfortunately she's not the only one like that though and tweets/posts/whatever like that seem to be pretty common... especially if something is popular. Most probably do it for attention.  It really annoys me though how fast some 'fans' can turn on their idols when they do something 'wrong'. Half the time the fans don't even know the full story or the idol didn't even really do anything wrong. Like dating rumours for example. Sometimes it's not even confirmed but fans get all angry over their ""oppa"", whose a grown man, dating. Stuff like that really frustrates me."
kpopslumberparty,35m4la,PottersPhoenix,8,Mon May 11 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"Personally I am Tao biased, so of course I find the tweet annoying. In my opinion, if fans are still waiting around for him to ""say something"" then ?????? because he's done quite a bit already, really.  Anyway, stuff like this is extremely common and nothing new. Most do have their opinions (though they are rather rude and frustrating) and are not afraid to voice them. Gotta get used to seeing it, really.  Also, welcome to kpop!!"
kpopslumberparty,35m4la,sprittany,5,Mon May 11 17:51:31 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, a large number of those kinds of people do exist. Know now though that EXO fans are (for the most part) the worst of the bunch by far, and not only with these types of things (saesang fans galore!!)  However, saying this, these types of people are in the heavy minority of kpop fans as a whole. Most other kpop fans just find these people irritating, and that they (sadly) give us a bad name.  TL;DR: The majority of us are just here for the beautiful music and sexy people, so have no fear :)"
kpopslumberparty,35m4la,TaehyungKimchi,4,Mon May 11 17:59:42 2015 UTC,"It is annoying....but that's pretty common ESPECIALLY on Twitter. A lot of people say mean things about celebrities never thinking about what it's like for the celebs. In Tao's case I think he's having the worst time and if he really is leaving then it's hardest on him. As mentioned before by Kimchi I've also heard EXO fans are the worst: I never understood what that meant but now I realize it means that they are the most brutal towards EXO....ironic, right?  Sometimes opinions are genuinely opposite of yours but sometimes, some people are just ignorant & awful. It happens. You just have to ignore those."
kpopslumberparty,35m4la,CandyLemon,2,Mon May 11 18:19:55 2015 UTC,"I wish i could come up with a name for these types of fans.. the kind who just write garbage in response to allkpop twitter posts, they're so generic and dumb."
kpopslumberparty,35m4la,saramdapgae,1 point,Tue May 12 10:25:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like either the meanness/immaturity of kpop fans (especially EXO-L) is exaggerated or I'm just living in a bubble that's protecting me from these people. Most of my kpop stuff I read is on /r/kpop, which I know is male-biased (girl-group-biased) and maybe a little friendlier on average on top of that. Going through comments on YouTube videos even, though, I never come across much of the nastiness that people go on about. On the sites I visit, kpop commentors and fans are mostly all roses and sunshine.  Where are all the mean fans hanging out? Twitter? Tumblr?"

kpopslumberparty,35c3k5,cherryblossomfairy,5,Fri May 8 21:51:07 2015 UTC,"I'm extremely boy group biased, so my group would be a boy one. I think I would have around six members, I just like the number and it seems to be a popular amount.  My group would have darker concepts, like VIXX Voodoo Doll, since I'm really into that kind of stuff. I'll treat the fans with a cutesy concept every once in a while.  As for what they would wear, I have no idea...? Though I'm not a huge fan of outfits that show too much skin (for boys. what an unpopular opinion).  The group would have maybe two comebacks a year?  Their promotions would last around a month, like most.  I would want them to have a unique sound, something that stands out. I don't know really haha.  I would totally be up to having different nationalities/ethnicities! I love Chinese members.  I would have one or two rappers (if they're good enough. I'm not going to just stick 'em in there) and the rest be vocals. I don't think I'd have a visual. Nope I would not add members. I'm not a huge fan of that."
kpopslumberparty,35c3k5,sprittany,4,Sat May 9 00:29:29 2015 UTC,"Girl group:   5 members: Main vocal, English-speaking vocal, Rapper, Main dancer, Visual; No new members will be added after debut. Sound: Very upbeat Electropop / Electrorock / EDM Dance concept: Fierce dancing associated with the more ""hardcore"" sound of EDM, fun and more ""feminine"" dancing associated with electropop / electrorock, but none of the overly cutesy stuff. The typical two promotional periods and a couple of unpromoted singles each year. English track every once in a while for a happier international fanbase. Collaboration with lesser-known Western artists every once in a while to help promote each other.   Inspired by my two favorite groups, Crayon Pop and T-ara, with some elements from my other musical tastes."
kpopslumberparty,35c3k5,pbdonut,4,Sat May 9 06:22:36 2015 UTC,"2 girl duo group called SnS (Sweet n Sour). Got a good girl/bad girl vibe going on, they each are their own type of visual. I want their voices to melt together perfectly, so they'll have to be in high synchronicity. They'll debut with two different songs at the same time: one song about the good girl trying to make bad girl good too, and the second is vice versa. Fun, creative harmonies and lots of great lyrics. Second promo single will be an acoustic ballad track (one of the girls would know guitar) singing about how no matter their differences they'll still be friends.  They would promote every 6 months with a two month promotion and have their own youtube/vine series of them doing their gg/bg schtick in different scenarios and lots of cover videos."
kpopslumberparty,35c3k5,Necara,2,Sat May 9 07:46:31 2015 UTC,Sweet n Sour sounds like a cool name! (Then again it's making me hungry for some sweet and sour chicken :P.)
kpopslumberparty,35c3k5,COTAnerd,4,Sat May 9 19:01:48 2015 UTC,"All female group with 5 or 7 members. They'd have a concept with varying levels of sexy, fun and fierce.  I'd have a general rule about the girls always being, at least, 65% clothed because I want to see girls being given the title of sexy without having to be mostly naked. If guys can wear suits and dance sexy and be considered sexy, then so can girls.  The sound would be generally rock-influenced, but will still have emphasis on good vocals and be danceable - but it wouldn't feel out of place if you were to mosh at a concert of theirs. They'll have a tough dance style, no lazy girl dancing! There'll be some provocativeness in there, but it would never be the main point. The debut would definitely be styled in an accessible watered-down punk.  5 member distribution: 2 main vocals, 2 main dancers and 1 sub-vocal/hype visual.  7 member distribution: 2 main vocals, 3 main dancers and 1 sub-vocal/hype visual.  I wouldn't add members. It'd ruin the balance."
kpopslumberparty,35c3k5,Equilibriumx,2,Sat May 9 02:51:07 2015 UTC,"Probably sound lame and casual but here it goes :  5 dudes  fierce concept, dance oriented. (think exo's MAMA or Overdose, SHINee's Lucifer, BEAST's Good Luck or Breath.)  About the fashion , i've no idea, just make them look hip, nothing extreme ( sorry g-dragon)  2 comebacks a year starting out and later on 1 comeback a year as they get bigger  3 weeks promotions  sound, probably something catchy but semi-aggressive, fast paced  if it would be possible, i'd go for American-born Koreans. Reason is, they could promote a lot abroad and stuff like that which is good for international marketing while still keeping the Korean in K-pop  1 Main vocal, 1 dude who sings really well but is not quite as great as the main vocal, 1 guy who can sing well, maybe rap a little bit, but is a dance beast ,1 really good rapper with a nice vocal sound ( think Giriboy ) and another rapper with a little bit more aggressive sound like chanyeol  i wouldn't add any members, too stressful imo"
kpopslumberparty,35c3k5,followthesound,2,Sat May 9 21:41:27 2015 UTC,"Ooh, this is a fun question!  I'd make a six-member boy group. The group would be heavily vocal-focused, and would do lots of multi-part harmony and even some a capella (just for album tracks, though, I don't think a capella would work well for promoted songs on music shows). Think Spica's kind of wall-of-sound, super tight harmonies in this cover and Pentatonix's awesome, upbeat pop sound. I would have them tend towards more upbeat pop songs instead of ballads (although they'd have a few of those) because I want to show how awesome and effective harmony can be in pop music. As far as the members go, I would want one tenor, one baritone, and one bass that are especially vocally talented and comfortable singing the lead parts. Then there would be one more of each vocal part - a tenor with an especially high range to hit those awesome high notes, a baritone who can also rap, and a bass who can also beatbox. I'd like them to all be able to dance, but their choreography wouldn't be too intense, because I wouldn't want it to interfere with breath control. Ethnicity of the members is sort of inconsequential to me, since musical ability is number one on the priority list. No members would be added to the group after debut, since their pre-debut training would place a lot of focus on creating a cohesive group sound. Visual-wise, I love BTS's styling for their I Need U promotions, so I would go with a similar look. The group would have two promotion cycles per year."

I could definitely see them out out some fun hip hop/pop songs. There's an awesome video of Yuri, Hyoyeon, and Henry performing a song during a SNSD concert. It's very much what I would want to see come out of a SHY subunit."
kpopslumberparty,350t72,teddy_westside_story,4,Wed May 6 06:07:43 2015 UTC,"Anyone can sound good as long as they sing within their range and with power, it gets corrected in the production booth anyway. Lots of Western singers have had extremely successful careers doing upbeat dance pop/R&B despite not being very good singers like Madonna, J Lo, Britney and Rihanna.  A SHY subunit could pull it off provided they were given good songs, which is the important part. Idols like Hyuna have done great despite not being able to sing well either. People are always like LOL YOU YOKE? They're not even popular! When it comes to K-pop a good song is a good song. SHY would do stuff like this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_txCqX1Uio  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BHL4dEZRFk"

kpopslumberparty,350t72,emii_gems,5,Wed May 13 19:24:55 2015 UTC,SHY are some of the most charismatic dancers in kpop. It would be a shame for them to retire without being able to really show their stuff.

Here's Yuri and Hyoyeon from a 2011 SMtown concert, another Yuri and Hyoyeon (and Yoona) from 2010, and here's an older video of SHY.  I don't know how great they are when it comes to the technical side of dancing, but I could watch them do bodyrolls and hairflips all day. They also seem to enjoy themselves, which is a big reason why I'm a fan!"

kpopslumberparty,34y5pt,sangtoms,13,Thu May 7 09:53:22 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the fandom, friend! I know the feeling. I've seen so many of their videos and I fall harder for them each time. BTS are a really unique group for me because they show how hardworking they are and how much they appreciate their fans ALL the time. As I always recommend, watch their Bangtan Bombs because those are funny as hell! Also American Hustle Life (when they went to america to learn more about hip hop) P.S Might I add, it might be difficult finding a bias in this group because they're all so lovable"
kpopslumberparty,34y5pt,DirtyDerpina,7,Tue May 5 19:06:31 2015 UTC,Can confirm. I now have 4 biases and I don't know what to do anymore. 4 biases. In one group. With 7 members. And the number is increasing with every other video I watch.  Fuk u bts u perfect bias-list-wrecker jerks ;____;
kpopslumberparty,34y5pt,sangtoms,2,Tue May 5 19:54:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you, thank you!   Bangtan Bombs is definitely on my list of what to watch!   Oh my, do you have a bias?"
kpopslumberparty,34y5pt,LostPristinity,3,Thu May 7 09:54:35 2015 UTC,"My bias is V, Jimin, Rapmon and Jhope :')"
kpopslumberparty,34y5pt,majekmistake,2,Thu May 7 10:33:14 2015 UTC,"After all these replies, now I'm thinking that I won't just have one bias in the end.."
kpopslumberparty,34y5pt,LostPristinity,5,Thu May 7 10:44:42 2015 UTC,"The first time i came across the group i passed because the MVs felt a little too young for me and i'm tired of the ""we;re so hip hop"" thing every boy group seems to reach for, so i didn't really give them a chance. Then earlier this year they put up this flawless video. I am a sucker for sharp choreography and this hit all the right points for me. So I gave them a second shot and, well i'm a rabig SHINee fan, but BTS is a group i have come to always enjoy because of their absolute abandon when it comes to being just a group of talented yet goofy guys. I am half-heartedly following Big Bang's comeback because i have known them for years but never really got into them (except glorious Daesung), but i am really digging the new album from BTS and really hope they win more awards because they definitely deserve it!"
kpopslumberparty,34y5pt,LostPristinity,6,Tue May 5 23:40:41 2015 UTC,"I had the same initial feelings about BTS! I remember seeing their debut and thinking, ""I get that I'm not their target audience, but what is a grown-ass woman supposed to do with a song about high school teenage angst?"" and I also think the ""hip-hop"" aesthetic with the really baggy clothes and chains and such looks really silly so BTS didn't really hit my radar very hard until I saw a clip of American Hustle and thought they were funny. After that I went back to their music and found more songs of theirs that I really liked."
kpopslumberparty,34y5pt,DirtyDerpina,2,Wed May 6 00:04:28 2015 UTC,"hahaha you summed up my initial reaction to ""War of Hormone"" exactly! Although, once i gave it a fair shot, i loved that at the end of the video only one of the guys ends up with the girl for once in a kpop video. And i'm glad they are maturing past the baggy hip-hop clothes and chains aesthetic. American Hustle was an eye opening experience for the group but also for me into really liking them for their personality (and i'll never not call Jimin ChimChim)."

So after months of refusing to watch a BTS MV, I somehow stumbled upon this. I don't know if this is a song or a trailer to what but good lord I was hella wrong about them. They are good. Heck no, they are amazing! I didn't know they were this amazing. I underestimated them which is so wrong of me im sorry bts fans but now I see why they are famous and why there are so many of my friends who LOVE this group so much. ^ This is the first BTS MV that I watched, do you guys recommend something else? ^        Actually SOML right now haha  Yes!

And every single photoshoot they've ever had. I'm a fucking wreck right now let me tell you.  I never thought I'd fall for them like that. But they're hands down perfect.

I didn't really give them a chance when they first debuted because I thought the hip-hop boy group thing was getting overdone, but all their music is actually really good and they're giant adorable dorks and I love them. I adore them all so much that I couldn't even settle on a bias until a couple weeks ago. :P You should definitely watch their show Rookie King, and all their BTS Bomb videos!"
kpopslumberparty,34y5pt,kittenmittons,2,Tue May 5 19:07:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had the same feeling about them as a hip-hop boy group! Wish I listened to them earlier ;__;   Alright, another show to add to the list! Who became your bias?!"
kpopslumberparty,34x6nm,pinkpanda09,10,Tue May 5 08:34:53 2015 UTC,"I feel like, if the members aren't happy with their situations, then they should have every right to change the situation if they can. It's their lives, they should be allowed to do what they want with them.  That being said, despite the fact that a Chen solo career would be my kpop dream come true, I acknowledge that any of the Korean members will be shooting themselves in the foot if they try to do what Kris and Luhan have done and break their contract and then try to do solo work. SM has way too much pull in the kpop market and EXO doesn't have enough notoriety to pull a JYJ."
kpopslumberparty,34x6nm,majekmistake,2,Tue May 5 11:09:27 2015 UTC,"Simply, I think it's sad that it gets to the point where they have to leave. I understand, and totally support all three (or two but...) in their decision. They're grown men who knows what's best for themselves."
kpopslumberparty,34x6nm,sprittany,2,Tue May 5 11:56:09 2015 UTC,"Well I only started listening to kpop a year ago in may and started obsessing about exo after kris left. So I never had an opinion about him leaving.  However Luhan. He is my ultimate bias and will never stop loving him. He made me feel better about myself when I was in a very low self esteem time period. His departure, I was sad. Not crying sad but I took it fairly well.  Now with Tao, for some reason I'm very worked up about this situation. He's only recently became top 5/6 bias out of exo but yet I'm sadder with him than my ultimate bias :/  With everyone included I know I should be happy for them but I still wished they stayed a little longer to see if it does get better for them. It sounds selfish ,and just a mentally wrong fan gir,l but I wish they never left. Going on hiatus would've been better but I tell myself that it's their lives they can do what they want regardless of 1 fan (me) who hasn't even got any album or things of theirs.  I can't help but feel sorry for exo too. Training a lot of years to become an idol in a group and slowly said group is falling apart at the fingertips. I sincerely wish the very best for each 12 members, in the group or not."
kpopslumberparty,34x6nm,PM_ME_YOUR_FOOD_OR,2,Tue May 5 14:39:14 2015 UTC,"It's their lives. Fans may feel upset but just image how they are feeling to even consider such a drastic move. Whatever the real reasons are, I don't think they are doing it light-heartedly. Korean members unfortunately don't even have the possibility to leave EXO if they wanted to. That being said, I do have a lot of empathy for how EXO-Ls must be feeling."
kpopslumberparty,34x6nm,VariantIN,2,Tue May 5 16:25:39 2015 UTC,"One thought, Exo members can do whatever they want as they see fit. They know what is best for them.  Second thought, they look so tired every performance, it makes everyone worry about their health and well being. Look at poor CY, he has 1 drama, 2 variety shows, performs Call me Baby every day, practices and rehearsal - all going on right now!... there will be nothing left of them soon with workload like that."
kpopslumberparty,34x6nm,kittenmittons,1 point,Tue May 5 20:35:46 2015 UTC,All of the sadness.  I still support EXO and will hope for the best!
kpopslumberparty,34x6nm,soheechul,1 point,Tue May 5 17:40:43 2015 UTC,"IMO it's just weird S.M. is not doing anything to make it better. They are slowly losing an extremely well-selling, bright future group.  IMO the Chinese guys will slowly leave one by one and then it's just gonna be Korean EXO with 8 members.  The reason is, even if someone from EXO-K or even the 2 Korean guys in EXO-M (Xiumin and Chen) would try to leave, they would have a really bad situation and pretty much dead career in Korea, where as the Chinese members can do stuff in China because, well they are Chinese."

kpopslumberparty,34pkd0,floating_around,13,Sun May 3 11:45:31 2015 UTC,"uh where to start...  I loved Lim Kim's two releases (Awoo and Love Game) but I'd have to say I love Awoo more. It's so unique and makes me want to listen to her more.  JYP's Who's Your Mama is fun and catchy, even it's a little...typical? I also just love JYP so there's that :)  Oh course EXID's Ah Yeah. It's catchy in the best way. I think LE did a great job of taking everything that made Up and Down successful without making Up and Down pt.2. It ended up being my favorite song.  Dal Shabet's Joker was a song I catch myself listening to a lot despite originally being disappointed by (it sounded very boring to me at first, and I'd wished for something more BBBish). And in the same vein 24K's Hey You, which I don't ""like"" but listen to a lot...  And my second favorite song of the month has to be Ahh Oop, I love Mamamoo, and eSNa made that track. So, I was disappointed some loudmouthed fans made her not promote with them (shout out to ahh shit though).  I still need to listen to BTS' new song more, It didn't grab me as quickly as their others have. And I don't know how I feel about the Big Bang song's yet, as GD kind of pushes it a little too much for me in baebae (Which is disappointing because I love everyone else in that song so much but its hard to get past his part...)"
kpopslumberparty,34pkd0,therealpopesquid,1 point,Sun May 3 13:42:54 2015 UTC,Ohmygod JYP!! I completely forgot about that! Those trumpets~~  I didn't really like Ah Yeah the first time I listened to it-just put it on as I was reading your post and I'm really feeling it now....
kpopslumberparty,34pkd0,therealpopesquid,2,Sun May 3 14:22:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was hesitant at first because it is very similar to up and down but you can't blame them - I don't love the chorus as much but I can't get enough of the hani and le parts.  And the jyp song is great, he's just good at making fun songs (oddly enough one of my all time favourite kpop songs is I Already Have A Girl by him too but it's completely different toned)"
kpopslumberparty,34pkd0,sprittany,3,Sun May 3 15:42:11 2015 UTC,Bae Bae by Big Bang! It's literally all I've been listening to since it was released. I also enjoyed I Need U by BTS.
kpopslumberparty,34pkd0,followthesound,4,Sun May 3 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"My favourite songs from this month, in order of release date:  Ahh Oop! by Mamamoo and eSNa - The funky retro concept is forever one of my fave concepts for girl groups, and Mamamoo pull it off especially well. The song as a whole reminds me a little bit of Spica's You Don't Love Me, which is a very good thing, because You Don't Love Me was my jam for the entirety of last year. The way the rap builds in intensity is so good, and I love that they keep their voices reserved until the very last part of the song, since it makes the last chorus so much more powerful.  Starry Night by Standing Egg - Obviously Standing Egg is more K-indie/folk than K-pop, but I always like to include them because they're excellent. The way the melody floats on top of the guitar is so beautiful, and the harmonies in the chorus made me tear up a little bit the first time I heard the song. It's the perfect song for calming down or going to sleep.  Hopeless Love by Park Jimin - THOSE CHORD PROGRESSIONS. THAT VOICE. THAT PERCUSSION. The whole song is just so well done. I am so impressed. With that voice, it's hard to believe Jimin's only 17.  Ah Yeah by EXID - How could I not include this song? I thought it was going to be very hard to live up to Up and Down, but they totally managed to follow up with a song that was on par with it. LE's rap is so good, and I love the weirdness of the pre-chorus.  Conduct Zero by BASTARZ - I love how loud and in-your-face this song is. It's so heavy on the bass, percussion, and horns, which gives the song a lot of energy. When I first heard the teasers, I thought that PO's parts were really going to the sell the song, but U-Kwon actually totally stole the show for me. I also really love the harmonies in B-Bomb's pre-chorus part!  Tell Me One More Time by Jinusean - Jinusean's old-school rap style in this video is so much fun, and Jang Hanna does an excellent job of singing the chorus hook! I especially love the second half of the chorus, with Jinu and Sean's voices singing under Hanna's!  Awoo by Lim Kim - This style of music is such a perfect fit for Lim Kim's voice. The backing track is kind of sparse but still super cool. I especially love when the piano comes in among the very electronic synth sounds, and the super-fast percussion subdivision in the chorus!  Love Game by Lim Kim - I actually prefer Awoo to Love Game, but Love Game is still one of the best releases of the year so far in my opinion, so Lim Kim gets two mentions on my list! I love how the song starts of with no instrumentation other than the rhythmic hand clapping percussion, with just Lim Kim's voice over top. And that single bar of silence between phrases at the beginning is just yessssssss. I also really like how the song switches from a very straight rhythmic feel in the verses to a slightly more swung feel in the chorus! And the part where it goes straight back into regular 4/4 time after the eight bars of cut time bridge... Man, there are so many cool individual little parts of this song that I could go on and on and on!  I Need U by BTS - I am a HUGE BTS fan so this obviously had to finish up my list! I'm so impressed with the musical growth that BTS has gone through since their last album - they've gone from music that screams youthful energy to a musical concept that's a little more subdued and mature. I think it's a really cool change for them, and even though the song shows a lot more maturity than we saw from their releases last year, it still has that underlying energy that BTS exudes. Suga's rap at the beginning is so powerful, and I am thrilled that the song features the vocal line so much. BTS has always promoted themselves as a rap group, but their singers are fantastic too, and they really got a chance to shine in this song. I especially loved hearing V singing in a more natural mid-range voice, rather than just being the token low-voiced guy in the group! My favourite part of the song has to be Jungkook's low harmony adlibs in the final chorus, and I also love the purely instrumental post-chorus section. It's just such a cool song and I'm so happy for BTS.  Big Bang's new songs are technically May releases (even though they came out on the 30th of April for me), so I'll save those for when I'm talking about my favourite songs from May! :)"
kpopslumberparty,34pkd0,VariantIN,3,Mon May 4 05:01:07 2015 UTC,"Since Big Bang came back on May 1st, all my April love goes to Lim Kim. Purchased the whole album and it's really good.

BTS- Sick This song was automatically added to my running playlist when I heard it. I get way too into it and yell 쩔어 every time.  Lim Kim- Awoo This is such an amazing song. I have yet to listen to the full album but I have really high hopes after hearing this and Love Game.  Big Bang- Loser Obligatory the boys are back!!! SO happy with this song and mv. Bae Bae has to grow on me some more but for now I'm not really feeling it.

kpopslumberparty,33ucbu,amiaheroyet,4,Sat Apr 25 20:03:56 2015 UTC,LMAO! Oh! was always corny! But I think I have a soft spot for GG's brand of corn because I stuff like Galaxy Supernova and My Oh My lol.  And Bar Bar Bar is so damn catchy I wouldn't feel guilty either just like how I don't feel guilty for likingloving Gee
kpopslumberparty,33ucbu,_Dantes_Inporno_,5,Sat Apr 25 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"Oh! Was one of the first GG songs I heard. I think after experiencing their darker and hard hitting comebacks (especially when they started putting out Japanese stuff) Oh! kinda fails to compare.  With that as said, Oh! Really is classic GG and is more of a novelty song these days."

kpopslumberparty,33ucbu,LostPristinity,9,Sat Apr 25 22:14:06 2015 UTC,It's the only cutie boy song I've ever listened to but: B1A4- What's Happening?
kpopslumberparty,33ucbu,LostPristinity,6,Sat Apr 25 19:16:53 2015 UTC,"B1A4 ""Beautiful Target"" is definitely my guilty pleasure. I listened to it at first for the Engrish, then it was catchy, and i couldn't stop listening. I liked 'What's Happening' as well, but not as much as BT. That is as cutie boy as i can get. Which is bizarre since half of the Jpop i listen to is cutie boys of Johnny's."
kpopslumberparty,33ucbu,Ravenjade,3,Sun Apr 26 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"For some reason I find cutie boy songs cornier than the cutie girl ones so the only one I've ever listened to is Hello by SHINee, and I've never really listened to B1A4 either (sorry). But I might just have to because of this fine piece of man meat That video though... what exactly is going on lol"

kpopslumberparty,33ucbu,shuumas,4,Sun Apr 26 06:10:19 2015 UTC,I showed the music video to the kpop club in my school when it first came out and I'm pretty sure they all silently judged me throughout the duration of the song for being a guy who likes this kind of music. Never again am I going to make that mistake.
kpopslumberparty,33ucbu,pbdonut,6,Sun Apr 26 06:28:13 2015 UTC,but girl groups are mostly manufactured for guys so.. its fine i guess

kpopslumberparty,33ucbu,funwithgoats,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:45:40 2015 UTC,I love them as well but I try not to be as open about listening to them as the other groups I listen to because of their more feminine concepts.

kpopslumberparty,33tpj7,justfornothing,3,Sat Apr 25 17:02:54 2015 UTC,"If you're in a pit I would suggest you tie up long hair, wear sturdy shoes, pants, and show up as early as possible if you want a good spot. Hardcore fans will be there the night before.  If you are seated you can relax quite a bit, I'd say don't worry about showing up any earlier than an hour or two before unless you are keen on talking to other fans in line. Also wear whatever you want, though keep in mind it'll be energetic and hot in there so layers you can take off are best.  If you are waiting a long time in line bring water and snacks (not chips, I'm talking stuff that will  sustain you), or bring a friend so one of you can go get food and then come back. I'd suggest talking to the people around you so they will know who you are and hold your spot while you go to the bathroom, etc. You will not be able to bring food or drinks or large backpacks into the venue probably, though they all have diff rules. Check on the restrictions specific to the venue. TRB has been pretty strict on cameras so I wouldn't try to sneak one in unless you are really good at it or willing to take the risk of getting kicked out or having your camera taken away.  Other than that, lightsticks are really fun to have if you can afford them, it gives you something to wave around excitedly and shows support for the artist. An ocean of lightsticks looks pretty cool :).   Oh yeah and don't forget something to shade with if you're in line in warm weather! I've seen lots of people with umbrellas.  Have fun!"

kpopslumberparty,33qixu,DirtyDerpina,15,Sat Apr 25 02:01:33 2015 UTC,"I'll try to pick the one most favourite per group, preferably dance practices, because otherwise woah that'd be one long list.   Good Boy - I love it soooo much especially during the chorus. Not only Young Bae as always but damn even GD is killing it.Also - holy balls it already has 10M views waaat VIXX's On and On - so on point. Plus all of them have perfect hair and look incredible so there's that. EXO's Growl - aka the song/MV/choreo that made me love them.  Forever favourite with bonus über cute Kai at the end   There simply can't be a choreo thread without EXO, deal with it.   Super Junior-M's Swing because it blew me away the first time. Still does.  Block B's HER - c'mon. It's fun. And they're dressed in costumes. C'mon. It's a tie between BTS' We Are Bulletproof Pt.2 and N.O. And War of hormone. And Danger. I know you can't see much in the last two but it's really cute. That part in N.O when Jimin 'fight' with the dancers while the rest kneel is genius. God I love them all. Shinhwa's This Love because it's one of their few songs I know lol and because I really fucking like it. Classic here - SHINee's Lucifer. Legit question - is it even possible to pick only one by SHINee?? I'm all about them boy groups, as many of you probably noticed, but 4minute's Crazy slayed me nonetheless."

Hyde, Voodoo Doll, Love Equation, and Eternity to name a few. GOT7's Magnetic/Neoran Girl. SNSD's I Got A Boy, Shinee's Everybody, a lot of B1A4. That's all I can think of right now.."
kpopslumberparty,33qixu,-nox-,4,Fri Apr 24 21:24:40 2015 UTC,"T-ara, Fiestar, and Gain are my favorites for dances. Well, Fiestar and Gain are my favorites period, but T-ara has really visually appealing choreo.  T-ara's Sexy Love is one of my favorite dances ever. It's just so nice  Gain's Paradise Lost is mind blowing and really unique and impressive.  Fiestar's One More and You're Pitiful are both really complicated and NOT EASY TO DO IN HIGH HEELS. One More involves a LOT of jumping and high stepping, and in You're Pitiful they STAND on chairs.   I am obviously biased when it comes to Fiestar, but I honestly think their dances are top-tier and they need more recognition, dammit!"
kpopslumberparty,33qixu,amiaheroyet,3,Fri Apr 24 19:47:45 2015 UTC,Overall: f(x) - Danger Favorite Choreography in a Dance Version MV: Super Junior's It's You Favorite choreography to dance along to: [Shinee's Replay(https://youtu.be/DocBfPIgk70) Fav Choreography for Music Shows: Brown Eyed Girls - Sixth Sense

The Ark's intro - was amazing;  they're so slick! I can't wait to see what they do next. Cross Gene - Amazing Bad Lady - because ALL the crotch and ALL the hair flips."

kpopslumberparty,33hl7d,CaduRocha,13,Wed Apr 22 16:11:20 2015 UTC,It's a pretty common Hip Hop formula that is popular at the moment.     There is also an argument that it's often a title thrust upon the less vocally gifted members of a group.
kpopslumberparty,33hl7d,HallyuNoona,9,Wed Apr 22 20:24:33 2015 UTC,"It's likely due to the influence of Seo Taiji and Boys, who had rap sections in their songs. Their group / song structure and formula influenced most of the K-pop acts that came after them.   I found a section of a book that discusses how Seo Taiji influenced rap sequences in K-pop."
kpopslumberparty,33hl7d,JessiTee,5,Wed Apr 22 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"It's because they need a legitimate position for their visuals.   Even if there's huge focus on looks and aesthetics, idols are still producing music and performances, so they need to have skills related to that.   When a company wants to put someone with exceptional looks in the group but very little else, they give them the rap parts which is easier to fake than dancing skills or vocal.  Look at most rappers in kpop groups and you'll notice they're almost always the visual and least talented singer/dancer.   TLDR: Being the rapper is the filler position given to visuals who can't sing or dance and need an excuse to be in the group."

kpopslumberparty,33f5fn,Glensather,14,Wed Apr 22 00:45:06 2015 UTC,"Basically the Golden Age of Kpop was 2009-2011. I would personally argue it started in 2006 and the best year of debuts would be 2009. This is when a majority of really amazing groups and songs came out and they were all unique and just awesome. In 2009 alone, f(x), T-Ara, After School, 2NE1, 4minute, Secret, Beast, MBLAQ, and Rainbow debuted. Starting in 2012, with the success of Gangnam Style, a lot of producers changed their approach. However I personally would argue it all went to shit with I Got A Boy by SNSD which triggered a shitstorm of weird songs that started a trend of 4 songs in one. I would consider 2013-2014 the Age of the Same Producers. Basically every group started using the exact same producers like Brave Sound, Shinsadong Tiger, and Duble Sidekick. Not that most of these songs weren't bad, but they were all pretty much the exact same formula. Imagine having like 5 comebacks in a month and 4 of the 5 come from the same person. It was just ughhhh. This is also led to a major decline in Kpop because all of them sound and are styled the same way. 2009 was so unique with such different concepts and songs, and each group maintained their originality (eh 4minute). The debuts of 2013 and 2014 thought they needed to follow the exact same formula as the music produced. The pressures changed.   Sorry if this was terribly written but I can answer your more specific questions :)"
kpopslumberparty,33f5fn,melgee,3,Wed Apr 22 01:07:02 2015 UTC,"It seems odd to me that what many consider to be K-pop's best years to be set up around a time of a ton of debuts. I didn't really listen to a lot of K-pop pre-2012, honestly, so all of this is still new and exciting to me, I guess. I was one of those who's interest really took off with Gangnam Style, but what really made me start listening to it a lot was HyunA and 4minute. I started listening at a pretty good time IMO; Volume Up wasn't even 3 months old so they set a really high bar for me.  I've listened to a lot of the stuff from that era, and it doesn't really stick out as any better or worse. It is a period of a lot of debuts that are still around today in some capacity (except I think Secret and MBLAQ are on hiatus?).  It seems to me more like 2009-2011 was the last period of truly unique concepts and groups coming out as opposed to the best music overall. In my efforts to consume all K-pop possible, I've watched every group that's come out since, and the only two I can think of off the top of my head that have floored me with how good they are is Mamamoo and The Ark. It's not to say that others who have debuted are bad, I just don't find them as captivating as those two.  As for the Age of Same Producers, I will totally agree there. While I usually enjoy what Shinsadong Tiger produces, I hate Brave Sound, and the stuff he released for HyunA (Ice Cream, blehhhh) and 4minute (that whole era you mentioned) nearly killed the group for me. Again, it's not that those particular songs were bad, it's just that they were... totally not 4minute (and yeah, IGAB is terrible IMO).  It also seems to be that many of the older groups are the only ones with any staying power. I've been reading a lot of knetz comments (attempting to learn Korean from all sources, even the dredges of Korean internet) and it seems many believe that most 2012+ groups don't last much longer than a year or so before being relegated to nugu status. It also seems to me that, at least in 4minute's case, they've realized that the era of Same Producers as you put it was awful, and are returning to older concepts that are truly unique.  I've heard that this year in K-pop will be much better overall for whatever reason. Would you agree to that? Because it seems to me that the past was less a golden age and the years in between were more of a ""Dark Age"".  I'm not trying to refute your points, just trying to gain an understanding. I don't want to get into a genre that's about to commit suicide :p"
kpopslumberparty,33f5fn,melgee,3,Wed Apr 22 04:41:40 2015 UTC,"Oh no don't worry about it I love discussions :)   I think the main thing to take away from the Golden Age was that everyone was seemingly different and the groups that were similar to another didn't do so well. But the thing to remember is how the music trends change. You are absolutely definitely right about how the older groups have staying power. It's because their main rookie period was during these couple years. Now 2013-2014 really weren't horrible years for Kpop (2014 was horrible for other reasons). I just read over all korean songs released in 2013 and 2014 and their were some really really good songs and albums. However 2 problems were shown.  Problem #1: Well, the main complaint recently with idols is how there are SOOO MANY OF THEM OMG. It seems theres always at least 2 or 3 debuting. When you think about it, the Golden Age is what triggered these groups to be formed. Companies saw this and realized they had to get in on this. So now there are tons and tons of companies and they all start to create groups. Training can take maybe 2-4 years (obviously thats not set in stone) so now all the groups training in the Golden Age are debuting these past 2 years. LOOK AT 2012 HOLY HELL. There are soooooooo many groups and unless they are really original it's hard to keep track and many of them disband without you even realizing. For example, I just watched the Dream Team episode with about 100 rookies with their groups. There were groups I knew and then their were groups I had never even heard of and they were complete nugus even after like a year or 2. I learned of a group called Live High (it's like the verb to live) and they had a song called Hakuna Matata and its a fun song, but it's not original but then again I like it. But the market has become completely. There are too many and half of them really aren't even that good and over half of the groups cant even get a stage for a music show.   Problem #2: The divide between sexy and innocent became clearer. Prime examples are AOA (popularity rose in 2014) and Girls Day (popularity rose in 2013). They both started out so different. I really liked AOA's old stuff cause they had a cool concept and the songs were fun. They didn't sell anything though. This could have been caused by Girls Day but thats just being speculative. Girl's Day had some really terrible songs and also some good songs when they were nugus. However once you start getting desperate for attention, you go sexy. So they did and they got really popular and are now considered to be a top girl group. AOA's first song into the descent of sexiness was Confused in late 2013. That year they had released Moya by AOA Black and it was amazing and I still jam to it, but no one paid any attention.  In 2014, every AOA comeback became all sexy oooooohs and butt/hip swirling. Confused -> Miniskirt -> Short Hair -> Like a Cat. And they got popular. Now people think to get attention you have to go sexy which causes half of all songs to have cleavage shots, ass shots, sexy dancing, and short and revealing clothing. When that's all you end up getting for a majority of groups it becomes so fucking boring. You don't expect any originality in everything. It's just ugh. Innocent concepts are very hard for groups because you can be around for a really long time and not get any attention cause it's generic and boring. You just really really need just one song to boost you up and thats it. 2013 was the year of NoNoNo. So if new groups didn't want to be sexy, they would go all cutesy.   Despite these issues, there are always groups that go outside these molds and usually they are from the Golden Age because you don't expect a group like f(x) to come out with like air grinding and wtvr. They just do what they have always been doing (cough 4minute). Actually honestly on 4minute I really liked Is it Poppin' and the song they did for the Brave Bros. album I Gained Weight but other than that it was all meh. The problem is now everyone is expecting, and getting groups that just do the same old thing. Now we have Mamamoo who I absolutely adore and The Ark who aren't totally original, but they are impressive and have overwhelmingly high potential because they are original. However that doesn't always work for people because nowadays originality doesn't mean much. Look at Spica. Absolutely wonderful group but are forever Nugus.   Are we in an age of decline? Compared to other people, I disagree we are not but we are in an age of different thinking. This is the age where the groups that deserve the popularity will earn it not just because they are sexy or not. People will naturally filter out what they don't like but now is the time every single group needs an amazing song. EXID got popular off a fan cam but a fan cam didn't make people buy and download a song, they all just really liked the song. So to answer your question, I have really high hopes for this year. Big Bang might or might not be part of that because seriously omg finallllyyyyyy. I don't really take golden ages or dark ages talk seriously because its different for everyone and their fandoms. It's easy to notice a decline and lack of originality but that doesn't always make songs terrible. Bestie's Love Options is still one of my absolute favourite songs but it was produced by Brave Sound. Note: its not the producers are bad but they have certainly lost some originality.   shit that was long"

The term itself literally expands into Korean net citizens and afaic it's similar to say redditors or tumblerites (or whatever the term is), but since there's no central site they post on, it's broadened to knetizens. As for why they show up on news sites? I don't really know, maybe it's a way of gauging the communities general views on a matter."

kpopslumberparty,33c94w,charleswhatnow,2,Tue Apr 21 11:35:13 2015 UTC,"The reason they show up on news sites, and why specifically they're often negative or misguided or downright hateful, is because the most popular site translating comments, netizenbuzz, only translates negative or controversial comments. I believe she used to work at allkpop so would have connections to English language kpop news sites, or else the sites might use her translations to give more interest to articles. Almost anything that happens at all in the kpop industry seems to get at least a few negative reactions online so there's always plenty to draw upon."
kpopslumberparty,33c94w,_cornflake,4,Tue Apr 21 12:55:19 2015 UTC,"I despise Netzienbuzz. Her entire shtick is just clickbait for international kpop fans who want to get mad about how 'dumb' Korean fans are. A lot of the articles she translates are completely irrelevant tiny pieces that hardly anyone is reading and the highest voted comments will only have about 50 upvotes. She'll find a few antis who've come and made negative comments about a group on one of these and report it as 'news'.  Also it's not as if there aren't constant ridiculous, hateful comments on international kpop sites as well. People act like no international fans are ever critical."

You have teenagers complaining about how backwards Korean society is and yet they literally know nothing...you can find comments like these on any NB article.  At the same time, I do like that NB quickly translates some hot topics really quickly & if you can understand that the really negative comments usually aren't highly rated it's not that bad"

Like PCY seems to be kind of an asshole who is sometimes thoughtless or mean but I swear I have heard multiple cases of people sending him death threats... Just don't buy his version of Exodus or criticise him (he deserves it!) or refuse to reblog gifsets with him in it. Don't spread a hashtag saying you want him to die, jesus christ.   Same with poor Tao, I saw in a thread about his rumours that he's had anti-fans since before he debuted and there were a bunch of Kris fans who hated him for clinging to Kris too much. Never mind all the crap he gets from netizens for just continuing to exist while being Chinese.   I've been feeling super protective lately, I don't know if I'm just noticing it more or if fandoms are getting more intense but it's very unsettling. :/"
kpopslumberparty,338cjd,ladauphine,12,Mon Apr 20 14:29:00 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents, especially about K EXO L's as lots of their international fans seem perfectly lovely. I think part of their problem is that they are just so freaking young and there are so so many of them.  Getting into anything here is an intense struggle for them so they have to be cutthroat and some people at that age haven't fully developed a sense of how their actions can affect others so they do some truly atrocious things to get to their oppas.  Their fans here really tend to be middle school/early high school crowd and we all know that middle school girls are considered some of the most vicious creatures to walk the earth. Pair all this with the lack of accountability for anything online and you've got all these hateful netizens.  Just a quick anecdote on the terrifying middle school EXO L. So one of my good friends was in Korea for SHINee's Everybody comeback and the comeback showcase was held in a big outdoor event (The Gangnam Hallyu festival) with no real tickets it was just a first come first serve sort of gig.  Well Baekhyun and I believe Suho were the MC's for this event and there were a couple of other groups at this festival but it was really meant to be SHINee's event. Due to the ""first come first serve nature"" that meant that there was overnight line ups... for three days.  Each fandom got a specific number of people in the close up standing areas (with Shawols getting by far the most) so the Shawols ended up having to do like legitimacy checks by looking at phone picture galleries and asking SHINee trivia questions to weed out the EXO fans that had infiltrated the line. A big group of EXO fans were found a bit in front of my friend in line and when they were found out and kicked out of the line (they would have to go join the actual EXO line) they whipped out freaking box cutters and tried to actually cut the Shawol girls. I think security ended up being called for that one.  ^ That was not a quick anecdote. I lied."

MCR was (is?) my favorite rock band, and had a gigantic impact on me in my late teens.  The band always struck me as huge nerds at heart, even when they were acting the rock stars, and it's one of the things that I really liked about them in the first place.  Much like /u/majekmistake 's situation, their break up hit me way harder than most people would say it should hit a woman in her 20s.  It was the discovery of kpop a year later that got me listening to new stuff, but I still very often binge my MCR/Yellowcard playlist.

kpopslumberparty,3366an,Uanaka,18,Sun Apr 19 22:37:48 2015 UTC,"As expected from me: SHINee.  Every single member is extremely talented at both singing and dancing (yes, even Minho and I will fight you on that with backing evidence). They are all absolutely wonderful at variety because they are all absolute idiots who simply do not care. And they all care about their fans and love their fans so much (it helps that Shawols are really quite sane and sort of motherly acting). Also they undeniably love one another. Like a family they get fucking irritated with each other sometimes but especially post Sherlock their affection for one another is really obvious inside and outside of their idol lives.  But honestly what makes them so special is how they exist outside of the idol world. They are all extremely tolerant of things like sexual orientation and race (there was the Macarena incident but Mexican shawols thought it was hilarious so its kind of iffy). They do volunteer work and donate to charities and orphanages. They use their fame well, like with Jonghyun's Twitter rants about LGBT and comfort women and making at least his fans aware of issues that they may not have heard of otherwise.  They're all genuinely good people and honestly loving them has made me a better person in some ways. It's definitely made me a happier person.  rabid shawol rant over"
kpopslumberparty,3366an,ladauphine,8,Sun Apr 19 22:53:46 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna completely agree with you on the talent!! Although Minho, uhm, well. He's talented! And i think it's that they can really be 'stupid' in a sense, that SM doesn't have as much oversight on SHINee as they do with their other boy groups, mainly EXO.   But I do like Shawols, over EXO-L's, (no offense to any EXO-L), but after hearing occasions about how toxic EXO-L's can be to other groups and even those of their own label (getting Shawols kicked out of broadcasting?) and then how terrible they were to Miss A with their comeback beating out Call Me Baby.  Not really sure what you mean from the whole post-Sherlock affection tho."
kpopslumberparty,3366an,ladauphine,8,Sun Apr 19 22:56:56 2015 UTC,"Ahh I just left for work do I can't link anything for a few hours but trust me when I say that Minho is anything but dead weight. He may not have the raw talent that Jonghyun say has but that doesn't mean that he isn't talented. He has a lovely warm voice and he is a really solid dancer, his long body makes some of the moves look utterly amazing when he does them.   As for the post Sherlock comment, lots of people will point to that era as a time of discord within the group. While it may or may not be legit, I'd say that for the first few years they were all still working out the kinks in the group dynamic but around/after Sherlock it's just very obvious that they found their balance with one another."
kpopslumberparty,3366an,ladauphine,6,Sun Apr 19 23:22:49 2015 UTC,"Definitely, I know everybody has their strengths, Minho has always been more of the face and mood setter for the group to me."

kpopslumberparty,3366an,ladauphine,6,Mon Apr 20 08:41:25 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with all of this. One of my favourite things about SHINee is the incredible trust between the group and Shawols. Like Jonghyun let fans touch his face and the fans were just super gentle and respectful. There are also pictures of SHINee members holding impromptu fan meetings and getting super up close with the fans with no kind of barrier. It's pretty hard to imagine that going well with most other Kpop groups. It's such an amazing bond, and while of course that's in part due to the Shawols, I think it really stems from the way that SHINee value and trust their fans.   (Sorry for getting mushy I just really love SHINee)"
kpopslumberparty,3366an,saramdapgae,3,Mon Apr 20 03:44:04 2015 UTC,"Yes my god the face touching thing was murder to see. Apparently all the Shawols told him to go back but he insisted and they touched him so gently. And there was the impromptu fan meet when T-ara were taking ages with recording and Shawols had been at inkigayo for like 15 hours or more. Jonghyun and Jinki came down and sat with them and they had like a 5 foot semi circle surrounding him.   I was lucky enough to get to go to a fan meet with him where the staff organized it that we could hold hands with him for a few seconds.   It was lovely and I was so scared that I barely put my hands out so Jonghyun reached out to grab my hands for a brief moment.

Their concepts are the ones you've probably never seen before by any South Korean girl group and these concepts make them a super fun group to follow and listen to. Also, they have a very close relationship with their fans; probably closer than any other groups out there. Back in 2012, they started off as nobodies. Through street performances, they built up a loyal fanbase that would support them whenever and wherever they performed. These fans even brought them food and gloves, anything to keep them warm and comfortable when they performed in the cold. In return, they show their appreciation to their fans by meeting with their fans wherever they are in the world. In South Korea, they hold a short handshake meet after almost every broadcast/performance. When they toured North America with Lady Gaga last year, they were nice enough to meet with their fans before/after their concerts and I was one of the lucky fans who were able to meet them in person at one of their stops. To this day, they still perform guerilla concerts, though not as much as they used to, and they've mentioned that they will always perform guerillas for as long as the group exists.  T-ara: Another fun group to follow. Cute, quirky, sexy; they've done almost every concept out there. They have some of the biggest hits in k-pop: I Go Crazy Because of You, Roly-Poly, and Lovey-Dovey. They may not be as big as Spice Girls, but they are one of the top girl groups worldwide when it comes to digital sales. Not just their older hits, but their newer EDM-inspired hits such as Number 9 and Sugar Free are great as well. Despite all the good stuff they're putting out, they're not successful as they were back in 2011 because of the bullying scandal in 2012. But forget that scandal and all the hate they receive for it. T-ara's one of the most consistent groups when it comes to releasing good music."
kpopslumberparty,3366an,gimmemoresalad,7,Mon Apr 20 01:37:52 2015 UTC,"(no news here)  I am not in the best condition to be doing this, but here I go anyway.  BIGBANG:  If I can boil it down, their music and the mark they're leaving on the industry. Hype and excitement (and overwhelmingly positive comments as we see and read) can only come for a group the public can rely on for solid releases. They haven't stopped releasing the same songs, but their sound always evolves for the better. Things are different when we see them. I can pick out each members voice (easy to do when there are 5 members), and they all work well together.  All five members do great as solo artists. But it's magic when they're together as a group. Find me another GD. Find me another leader who has taken his group to the top, with members who have matched expectations and energy. I love all the members because I can see the success they've hit and the careers they've made form themselves, and it's just awesome. I will always see the little kids from the documentary deep down inside. It makes me so proud.  I love them because there is just something indescribable about them, try as I might to find it. They were my first group, and they'll always be my number one.    Bonus: my /r/kpop write up on them for those who want an intro. Or if you want to hype yourself up even more for May."
kpopslumberparty,3366an,life-finds-a-way,0,Mon Apr 20 02:19:10 2015 UTC,"Find me another GD.   Give Zico another year or so. I think he's heading that way. Looks like we're getting into the solos-and-subunits stage of the idol group life cycle, which is a stage many groups never even reach... I think getting through Thailand and the split from stardom with the group intact is something not many leaders could pull off, but GD just has pure age advantage here lol"
kpopslumberparty,3366an,gimmemoresalad,2,Fri Apr 24 02:46:10 2015 UTC,"I love Jeeko. He's certainly heading for that type of leader capacity. And he'll be recognized for it. But I will say that GD has more than age.  When GD first approached the solo/subunit part of the career, he had given us Lies and Haru Haru. And that cemented BIGBANG at the top. That's an unfair thing to hold over anyone (nobody is exactly another GD...or Zico or anyone for that matter), but I feel that's an important part of GD and his mark on kpop."

He's been so busy dealing with all the shit they've been through, they haven't really gotten to make that mark on the industry the way I think they eventually will. They're unique and they do amazing things, but I don't think they've made that impact yet. For BigBang and GD, things played out differently (because obviously they're different people with different circumstances)... Also GD didn't have to make his way in an industry that had GD in it lol"
kpopslumberparty,3366an,VariantIN,5,Fri Apr 24 03:22:28 2015 UTC,"Super Junior is my ultimate favorite. I listen to a few kpop groups and I like them all, but Super Junior will always be number one for me.  It's very hard to have an ultimate bias in SJ because 1. they're all gorgeous, 2. they're all incredibly talented, and 3. they're all down-to-earth and so nice and generous.  Every member of SJ is unique in their own way and they all come together to make an incredible band. I love how they act like themselves and I especially love how Heechul doesn't take any of SM's bullshit.  ELF for the most part are understanding and get along with other fandoms, but sometimes they can be really childish and even SJ calls them out on this. But when ELF is being mature we have the greatest relationship with SJ. SJ loves us and appreciates us with all of their being and vice versa. The community is so wonderful and I'm so glad to be a part of it!!  <3 SJ ~~"
kpopslumberparty,3366an,VariantIN,3,Sun Apr 19 23:06:49 2015 UTC,"HMM! SuJu/DBSK were a bit before my time which I kinda consider the very beginning of the 2nd generation of k-pop. I got interested the SNSD/2ne1 era. Although I know Super Junior is super accomplished and a frontrunner, they're a bit 'meh' to me in terms of connecting with, not music and accomplishment (granted this is because they're a bit old and a bit harder to connect with). It's amazing to think they've been around for so long that LeeTeuk/Heechul are already past 30!"
kpopslumberparty,3366an,keine_panik,5,Sun Apr 19 23:48:17 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna go with 2NE1 because they were my gateway into kpop and are still my ultimate bias group.   I'm not really a person that cares too much about variety (I find a lot of those shows incredibly cringey) or even dancing (I mean it's nice but it's not gonna make a become a fan of a group), so for me falling in love with 2NE1 was 100% about the music. Even before I even knew what kpop was, let alone other groups or even knew what 2NE1's members' names were, I had downloaded three tracks that I would listen to occasionally and always thought were super cool, different and modern (one of the songs was ""Follow Me""). Not in terms of being kpop but just in terms of pop music.   Years later...yeah, I don't know what took me so long...I decided to see if they had released any new stuff and BOOM they had just released ""Come Back Home"" and that was pretty much it for me. I started becoming a huge fan of 2NE1 and then a little bit slower (gotta admit it initially tooke me a while) a fan of k-pop in general.  For me 2NE1's music is still one of the best produced music in all of k-pop. They have a very distinct sound and I love that they have songs that are just so cocky and in your face like ""I am the best"" or ""Hate You"". I also adore their ballads. ""Missing You"" probably is one of my favourite kpop tracks ever. As far as the single members go I'm pretty much in love with CL and I love how far she has come ever since being a trainee. Minzy also has an amazing voice and is a great dancer. Dara and Bom are both incredibly sweet and Bom specifically is probably one of the most random and dorkiest people I've ever watched on television.   But yeah what makes 2NE1 my favourite group is definitely the music. I honestly never get sick of their songs and that's incredibly rare for me."

kpopslumberparty,3366an,majekmistake,4,Mon Apr 20 16:34:41 2015 UTC,"I'm incredibly tired right now but I promise I'll update this with a post about Mamamoo, since inexplicably no one has written about them yet. Here's a taste of what's to come, from their appearance on Immortal Song.  Edit: Mamamoo (마마무) had their official debut in with the song Mr. Ambiguous (Mr. 애메모호) in 2014 but even before that they had a couple of collaboration singles with well-known singers, such as K.Will + Wheesung and Bumkey. That's one of the reasons they were so well received over in /r/kpop.   Their most obvious strength lies in their amazing vocals. As far as female groups are concerned I would say only SPICA are on par with them. However, where SPICA released relatively conventional pop songs (maybe with the exception of You Don't Love Me), Mamamoo have a very distinct retro style that sets them apart. What made me fall for them was their great stage presence. They do fun ad-libs for every performance and as far as I know they choreograph a lot of their own dances.   Their members Moonbyul and Hwasa are also talented rappers; Moonbyul's love for the genre is especially appearant. I hope she'll get a solo track at some point.   As if all of this wasn't enough, they also have absolutely lovable personalities. And by that I mean they are huge dorks. The channel MamamooTrans has a lot of subtitled videos if you want to check them out off-stage.  Some favorites:   Their newest single Ahh Oop and a performance (sans collab partner + songwriter Esna). Piano Man, my favorite release so far B-Side Gentleman with Esna Cover of Stooshe's  Love Me Cover of 김영광's 잠깐만 on Immortal Song"

Namely Hello Baby and One Fine Day (they each went to a different part of the world for this show), but there is also Yunhanam if you want to cringe a lot (the premise is that they go on dates with older girls, this was just after Replay came out so they were all super young).

I was watching the Dream Team special with the 110 nugu female idols, and I was thinking, what if Hwanhee had gotten into SNSD instead of Tiffany? Hwanhee is the girl famously known for being Seohyun's best friend. They entered SM the same year and trained for five years, but she was cut from the lineup at the very last showcase.  Her looks and even her personality is quite similar to Tiffany's (eye-smile, outgoing), so I understand why SM eliminated her. Would Tiffany be back in California, working in fashion or something?   Also, there is that eternal ""What if Hyunseung stayed in Big Bang question."" What if Mino had debuted in Block B? What if the JYP girl group with Hani, Hyori, Yuji, and Jieun had never been scrapped? What if Soyeon debuted in SNSD, instead of T-ara?"

kpopslumberparty,331p08,therealpopesquid,9,Sun Apr 19 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"I think that what would have happened would ultimately be that newer kpop girl groups would not be the same, Hyuna would not have had her solo career, and the Wonder Girls would be in the same position as they are now. For the other girls of 4Minute, I think that they would not be as successful if they still debuted.  The thing is, the Wonder Girls had a nicer image than 4Minute. From the start they played on, what was at the time common, cutesy styles. Hyuna never left because of a style choice or disagreement with anyone or the company or anything, it was a medical problem. So I think, she would have stayed with them, and the same poor decisions would have been made. They would have had major success then disappear to pursue a career in america, ultimately leading to their downfall as they disappeared during the hallyu wave (without major american success).   Hyuna's solo career was built off of 4Minute's style, so for that I don't believe she'd have been as successful. If she solo'd it would not have been the same at all. Another thing to think about is Troublemaker, as that would have never happened and has set benchmarks for duets - as nothing quite like it had happened before.  As for the comment relating to new groups. I think 4Minute was one of the first groups to go for the more electronic, hip hop, rapper heavy female kpop sound. From the beginning. And it really branched kpop a certain way. Even if the other girl's debuted without Hyuna, her rapping and sound is somewhat defining of 4Minute.  Also, while annoying at times, she really did make the group well known and popular. And without her that would be entirely different.   It sounds silly but I think since 4Minute was a pioneer of a now common kpop subset, and that being mostly to do with Hyuna, I think a lot would be very different.   (also I know this was posted ages ago but I was just thinking about this the other day oddly enough)"
kpopslumberparty,331p08,therealpopesquid,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:40:54 2015 UTC,"You don't think they would have been marginally more successful with Hyuna as opposed to Yubin? Granted, at the time they had exactly the same amount of star power (that is, 0), but what we know of kpop history tells me she is talented enough that I think that after Wonder Girls came back from America they could have salvaged their Korean careers. Maybe.  As for 4minute and Cube in general, I think Troublemaker might have still happened, and my money is on either Jiyoon or G.Na."
kpopslumberparty,331p08,TaeTaeyeon,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:16:57 2015 UTC,"I think that it's not about their talent. Its about marketing. Hyuna is super talented, but so aren't the Wonder Girls. It's more about the fact that they disapeared for years and came back without any success. They were still popular when they came back, Be My Baby and Like This were big.  But with it taking so long instead of becoming untouchable like SNSD (who shared the same-ish style and debut era) they came back, were still successful, but faded out.   I think that that would happen regardless of the lineup of the Wonder Girls, because it was more a marketing plan result. Hyuna may have a solo career, but the fate of the Wonder Girls would be the same, in my opinion."

I'm mostly worried about verbal instructions because the fansign seemed to rely a lot on a guy with a megaphone explaining the process.   I've never bee able to go to US kcon (wrong side of the country) so I feel like I should be sure and go to this one even though it's not exactly my list of favorite groups. I think I will just buy myself a ticket and go alone, because it would still be fun anyway."
kpopslumberparty,32on1q,shuumas,2,Wed Apr 15 13:51:02 2015 UTC,"I actually just started to get into B.A.P last week when I stumbled upon their MV for Warrior. I don't listen to many boy groups (only Block B and BTS really) but B.A.P really caught my attention. I love their kind of concept when they go hard in both the song and choreography. Therefor there's a few songs by them I don't enjoy but geez, it's like that with every group honestly!  One shot is probably my favorite song by them. I really love the sound of it and I thought the MV was fantastic. Error is one of my favorite MV's in kpop and this one is right up there together with it.   The only members I know are Zelo and Yongguk. I'm always more interested in the rappers when it comes to boy groups. That's why Zico and Rap Monster are my other male biases. But Yongguk has an amazing voice. I didn't believe my ears when I first heard him rap. Zelo is just awesome. His flow is insane, especially in Warrior which was the first song I heard by them! However I do acknowledge the vocalists aswell and I'm really impressed by the whole group in general!"
kpopslumberparty,32on1q,BrigidAndair,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"Ooh! These boys are my babies! Or am I their BABY......  The way I view the alternate ending is like a somewhat more literal interpretation of the song's subject. The song is about how you only have one shot at life and your dreams, so if you get a chance you'd better take it, because it could be your only one. I always thought that they took the ""shot"" (when Youngjae was shot after the exchange), showed how one shot can drastically change an outcome. A little cheesy, but I kinda like it.  As for the group itself, I actually am in class right now, but I'll sit down after and tell you all about my wonderful boys! And soon, you will love them....yes..."
kpopslumberparty,32on1q,Uanaka,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:26:53 2015 UTC,"I've heard alot about them, and I never really listened to them much, except for a few songs. After surfing my kpop news sites, I found out that Daehyun won the best kpop vocalist, and I was wondering if anyone could recommend songs with him where I can really listen as to why he's considered so good?"
kpopslumberparty,32on1q,BrigidAndair,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:09:23 2015 UTC,"It's not my favorite B.A.P song, but ""All Lies"" shows of his range and ability pretty well. Really, he's a powerhouse in just about any B.A.P song you could listen to."
kpopslumberparty,32on1q,Uanaka,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:43:31 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, what sets him apart from other male vocal powerhouses? I've always heard that Junsu was without a doubt one of the strongest idol vocalists followed by Changmin, JongHyun etc. even Leo of VIXX, yet I never really heard much about BAP or Daehyun."
kpopslumberparty,32on1q,BrigidAndair,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:02:03 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a vocalist, clarity and consistency mainly. Junsu has great control, but tends to sing through his nose, and Changmin is similar. Jonghyun and Leo both have a strong support and wide range, which is fantastic. Daehyun has an incredibly powerful voice, sings with proper technique, and on top of that he has a very unique voice and clear tone to go with it. He's excellent live, too.  The main reason you don't hear as much about him is because, though they're not an overly obscure group, before their lawsuit they never gained as much popularity as TVXQ/JYJ, SHINee, or even VIXX."
kpopslumberparty,32on1q,Uanaka,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:13:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for that analysis of them! If you can, what do you think of Taeil, of Block B? He's personally one of my favorite vocalists along with Leo (I guess I'm a generation too late to appreciate Junsu and Changmin :P).  Ahh I completely forgot about the lawsuit with them, they've been in that lawsuit for years right? Is there a reason why it's taking so long?"
kpopslumberparty,32on1q,BrigidAndair,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:51:52 2015 UTC,"Ugh, it feels like years, but it's only been since last November.  First off, I feel that I need to say that I love Taeil. He has a smaller range than most other powerhouse vocalists (at least that he uses), but that doesn't make or break a vocalist. When he sings in his mixed voice, he has lovely resonance, but on his higer notes he tends to push and strain too much, which all but eliminates that. His chest voice sounds either undeveloped or uncomfortable for him, which could be fixed with consistent and proper training, but he doesn't really use it in Block B. He has a light, pleasant tone, and he sings confidently live, as well as knowing what his abilities are, which he uses to his advantage.  Honestly, that's how most (good) kpop vocalists are. They go for a style more than what might be more proper technique, and they master that.  That's really what sets apart the good ones from the adequate one, is their ability to work within those confines and still produce a pleasant to listen to product."
kpopslumberparty,32on1q,Uanaka,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:45:52 2015 UTC,"oooh, for some reason I just love reading this and your other comment. it's just so insightful. But i definitely agree with the higher notes for Taeil, in his newest song, Inspiring, when he hits that high note, it's beautiful but you can just tell it takes a lot for him.  Just your opinion though, who do you like? Both male and female?"

kpopslumberparty,32mv8g,ayemies,9,Wed Apr 15 17:28:41 2015 UTC,"I am lucky enough to be able to live in Seoul and go to promotional activities when they do them. I went through the entire BASE promo cycle and got to meet Jonghyun four times during it.  First time was a handshake event during an Inkigayo fanmeet. It was terrifying but he was very sweet and his hands were very warm. I got the honor of being the very first foreign fan he met after his solo debut.  Second time was a fansign at the COEX SM Artium. He was wearing that Shawol blue suit and looked absolutely incredible. I was literally the only foreigner that got into that fansign and he seemed very happy by my presence. He read my name aloud from the note as he signed it and pretty much stopped my heart.  Third time was the Yeongdeungpo fansign. It was an open fansign in a mall. By this point I'm pretty sure he started to recognize me. This time I was super prepared and I was able to tell him exactly what I had been wanting to tell him for years all while he was staring deeply into my eyes. Not sure how I survived this in hindsight. Because it was an open fansign I have found fansite video footage of when I was up there.  Fourth and final time was during the Nowon fansign. It was closed in a cinema and was a very intimate sort of affair. This is the one where I became certain that he remembers me as he said my name to himself, like he was proud that he remembered how to say it, not like the first time where he was saying it in a questioning way. He spent literally the entire time giggling at me too, I lost my goddamn mind somewhere between my seat and the table (probably when he said my name under his breath) and just sputtered the whole time. He did interlace his fingers with mine again that time though. His hands are extremely soft with really defined knuckles. I also got him to sign ""자기야/jagiya"" at this one. It was popular cause of the line in Deja Boo. This made him laugh a lot that the little foreign girl was asking for that.   God I miss him. :( I can't wait till the comeback to be able to see him and all the others regularly again."

kpopslumberparty,32lpiz,ayemies,19,Tue Apr 14 20:11:46 2015 UTC,"Beast and Infinite.  I really do like their songs. I actually love almost every single song on Beast's Good Luck album.  At first I thought it was because of their respective members, because none of them caught my attention right away... But then I found out I actually really enjoy some of them in variety, some of them I even find very attractive and love, for example, Hyunseung's voice.  But no matter how much I try, I can't bring myself to actually become a fan?  Which is really weird for me because once I obsess over a song for longer than a week (which happened both with Infinite and Beast), I kind of automatically start learning more about said group, members, look up more of their music and so on. Basically being a fan stuff.  And I didn't and don't have the need to do that with Infinite and/or Beast whatsoever and I have no fucking idea why.  One of the factors may be that I've still got them all a little mixed up. Like if I see Yoseob alone I have to think first for a 5 seconds about whether he belongs to Infinite or Beast. That doesn't help me very much either lol"

kpopslumberparty,32lpiz,FyahCuh,2,Wed Apr 15 01:49:00 2015 UTC,If you want more SHINee be sure to check out their Hello Baby (which his hysterical) and their One Fine Day (also absolutely hilarious). They have really solid variety shows.  Also if you want to be in pain the entire time watch their Yunhanam. The entire premise is them going on dates with older girls. Its torture. Hilarious and really cute but cringeworthy torture.

Their solo stuff is aweome but meh to Big Bang.  I love CL, I think she's an amazing artist. 2ne1? Not so much. I put a little bit of blame on some Blackjacks: Since I'm a huge 4minute fan, I hear constantly about how they rip off of 2ne1 (especially recently), which I found hilarious because both groups debuted around the same time with roughly the same concept (fierce/sexy/etc).  I just can't seem to enjoy any of the post-Run Devil Run or Hoot (I never can remember which came first) stuff from SNSD, so this one half-counts (I do enjoy CMIYC because I like EDM, though).  Miss A doesn't do it for me either, which I find really unfortunate because they seem to be pretty awesome.  Super Junior. The only one I like is Henry. The rest of them I find really boring and keep trying to get into but I can't.

I'm a huge Blackjack and while I've always liked 4Minute I've absolutely loved their most recent comeback. I really don't get why some Blackjacks bash 4Minute (but then again I don't get fandom wars in general). It's not like 2NE1 own a whole kind of music or anything. Also shouldn't we all be excited about more kick-ass girl group comebacks instead of stupid fandom wars? These kind of concepts are still so rare in k-pop. The way I see it: the more the better, especially if they go hand in hand with such tunes as ""Crazy""."
kpopslumberparty,32lpiz,Glensather,4,Tue Apr 14 22:32:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree entirely. Girl groups were owning their sexuality long before 2ne1 and 4minute (see: Brown Eyed Girls in Asia, Destiny's Child/Beyonce and her Backup Dancers and TLC in America) and being fierce, so it's hardly new. I for one think both Blackjacks and 4nias need to embrace each other. We both enjoy the same ""niche"" content."

You can also argue that modern songs are all influenced by past works. I mean, you can easily pick out kpop songs that aren't throwback songs to the 80s/90s. I mean, one thing is that they're selling to the consumer. The majority of Koreans are now middle-aged and by incorporating an ""older"" sound they can relate to young kids today (kpop consumers) but also the majority of Koreans.  I don't know what you really mean by ""evolving"" the genre. You can argue that kpop HAS been evolving, especially with a bigger influence of house/EDM/dubstep that is more widely accepted (vs disco/techno of the past) starting from 2009 onward. I don't think it's fair nor correct to say that kpop is in danger of being stagnant and not evolving, there are plenty of songs on both sides of the spectrum"

kpopslumberparty,32m3a9,saramdapgae,2,Wed Apr 15 00:58:54 2015 UTC,I always joke that K-pop is about 15 years behind western pop. A lot of the stuff I listen to seems to sound like it's fit in an early-2000s club or something.  Of course then EXO briefly morphs into the Backstreet Boys and warps us back into the mid 90s but you get my point.
kpopslumberparty,32m3a9,Glensather,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:21:31 2015 UTC,"No T-ara? I guess they are more 70s than 80s/90s :P I'd say that a lot of Mamamoo's, EXO's and even 2NE1's music is throwback too.  That's pop music for you. The hooks are pretty much always the same, the only ""modernity"" is incorporating EDM/hip hop/jazz elements in the songs. Western pop music heavily samples old songs as well. Anaconda is Baby Got Back."

kpopslumberparty,32m3a9,haru_69,2,Tue Apr 14 23:21:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Call Me Baby sounds like an *NSYNC song to me, also the R&B sound on their album is pretty 90's, although with updated production. The intro in Playboy reminds me of TLC's No Scrubs. The music in Mamamoo's Piano Man is very 70s-80s, it's almost like a Japanese pop song from that era (think Cutie Honey) but repackaged like a swing track.  As for 2NE1 I guess I was referring to their older tracks. Hate you is clearly influenced by Real McCoy's Another Night (or even Barbie Girl but I might be reaching). Go Away sounds a lot like girl group anthems from the late 90's/early 00's. I Love You and Happy sound retro to me too, but I can't pin point what it is.  Anyway, I think one of the main appeals of kpop is that is DOES sound old? Producers like JYP, Shinsadong Tiger, Sweetune and, arguably, Teddy, are clearly influenced by music from the 80's and 90's because that's what they grew up listening to. Since kpop is so trend based (and the 90's is basically the trend right now) and written by a handful of people, the songs are bound to sound a little same-y in style.  More 90's obsession: Topp Dogg - Annie  1PUNCH - Nightmare"

Pretty much any EXO-M rap (I actually think Tao's probably better than he gets credit for [see: Rewind] but Mandarin's difficult to rap in as is, and most EXO songs are written more with Korean in mind)  The screamo-interlude from MAMA.  I liked it for the sheer amount of epic diva-wailing, and its not everyday to you see a pop song incorporate Led Zeppelin samples and gregorian chanting.  But then it hits that part thats just awkward and dissonant, and it crosses a line from ""weird"" to ""unpleasant.""  Most of Wolf.  Some parts are amazing (that flute intro, pretty much every element of the production, the idiosyncratic vocals) but other details kinda ruin it (ah sarangheyo , ""oolf"", the lyrics, the howling), and it falls short of avante-garde greatness and just becomes more of a joke."

Thanks so much for the review, I think you really hit it on the dot for most people, At first I thought CMIYC was supposed to be a comeback, but then I realized it's just a korean remake, so I guess I gave it more slack there, but moving on from that, it was meh. But it did do a great job for showcasing more members and a much harder dance routine like they did in the past. They're getting older so it's nice to see.  But ARK wow, I think they're part of the forefront to lead the 3rd generation of kpop idol groups along with MAMAMOO and Red Velvet, I was a huge fan on Minju before but now I am a ARK fanboy, or whatever their fandom will be called. I definitely think they'll definitely rise once the older girl groups retire out, I hope they and RV lead the way"

A lot of the English words that are borrowed into the Korean language came through/are related to popular media so 'scandal' gets thrown around a lot in the pop culture realm but not as much during the more serious corruptions that English speakers would usually call ""scandals"". For those they use Korean words that hold more weight, like 'scandal' holds in English."

A couple years ago it was ""well being"", more recently it was ""healing"" which was used EVERYWHERE (and still is used a lot), right now you hear people always talking about ""phobia"" or especially ""trauma"" (and used for anything they're scared of). There's just a culture of using trendy phrases and further, just following the trends for food/clothing/makeup/etc."

If it needs to be idol vs idol, then anyone vs Hongbin. I don't hate him, just want someone to fight him."

Kris (with Luhan as tag-in) vs. Tao (with Sehun as tag-in) -Tao would win unless Kris uses Tao's vainess against him. Luhan would thoroughly kick Sehun's ass though.  2am vs 2pm  edit: Esna vs Jessi

We're gonna get that weird crap that usually wouldn't make the cut. And probably songwriting from the other members a lot more. I want to hear rough BB.   SHINee   I really like the campy boyband for boyband's sake things they do. I wouldn't get tired. But every once in a while, they release a darker or different single. I want to see dark SHINee.  Block B   We wouldn't get the same thing. They always change it up, and since they get assigned parts based on abilities and fit, we'd get to hear them rotating a lot.   f(x)   It's a shame they don't get more attention. They have great tracks that I think should be promoted. It's electro and hiphop and fun. The amount of members is just right. You get to hear each, and their voices all go well together.   2NE1   They always change things up. MVs are always different. I love them. I want to hear what Teddy and now CL can give us. Oh, and more Bom of course!"

I guess I was a generation too late to the kpop fans, but I like their older hip hop and singing, but when they transitioned to more electronic (fantastic baby) just felt too much of a crowd pleaser and not enough artistic elements."
kpopslumberparty,31uy3t,Uanaka,2,Thu Apr 9 03:17:50 2015 UTC,"Fair enough!    My opinion (fwiw):  I'm grateful for everything. The earlier things were very much indicative of the music scene at the time, and GD knew how to write for it. Then he kept the group evolving. I would have loved more Lies and Haru Haru, but things would also get stale for me.  For Tonight, there was Love Song, What Is Right, and Cafe. For Fantastic Baby, there was Love Dust, Monster, and Bad Boy. I maintain that they still make the same music, but they've just grown up a bit."

kpopslumberparty,31uy3t,WeFightTheBlues,4,Wed Apr 8 12:28:59 2015 UTC,"VIXX. I could absolutely never get tired of them. They have plenty of different concepts and styles, so I think they'd be able to entertain successfully.  As for a group I would get tired of, I don't really have a specific one in mind. I just think I would get tired of around 95% of all groups out there real quick."
kpopslumberparty,31uy3t,sprittany,2,Wed Apr 8 19:37:48 2015 UTC,"Ahh Vixx, I really really love their hard hitting and faster songs especially from their Jekyll Repackage."
kpopslumberparty,31uy3t,Uanaka,3,Thu Apr 9 03:18:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think I could get tired of B1A4 comebacks.  You have 2 members who compose songs (JinYoung and CNU) as well as their staff producers and we still haven't even seen SanDeul's or GongChan's full potential in their songs either (their duet isn't overly known outside of fans and they could get so many more opportunities for the public to get to know them) and I think having that opportunity would do wonders for them.  With so many comebacks I would even love the chance to see more singing from Baro as he doesn't seem overly comfortable with it compared to rapping, but at least he could do it for a month and then move on if it doesn't work."
kpopslumberparty,31uy3t,Onpu,3,Wed Apr 8 12:13:53 2015 UTC,Shinee or Infinite. Exo too because Lay and Chen are a power couple with vocals and dance (well Lay anyway) and I can't get enough.
kpopslumberparty,31uy3t,jsalad,3,Wed Apr 8 16:31:21 2015 UTC,"Infinite because they still haven't released a song that I don't like, I love mos of their MVs, and they have awesome personalities.   Exo for the same reasons and because they have so many members that their comebacks are even more exciting.  Honestly, I doubt it's even possible for me to get bored of my favorite groups having comebacks. Although it would take out the excitement of having to wait some months before the next comeback to finally listen to their new songs."
kpopslumberparty,31uy3t,MarshmallowAisu,2,Wed Apr 8 20:41:09 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. For groups I would still enjoy, I think I'd probably pick a group where I've liked all/most of what they've put out so far. Off the top of my head, I'd probably go for Legend, M.I.B, or Phantom.  Legend - Legend is a nugu rookie group and their discography is really small right now but I have totally loved every song they've put out and I think they've shown a lot of side of themselves, musically. I think they have a lot of strong potential. I would love to see what they would do with that many comebacks.  M.I.B - M.I.B has had a couple misses here and there in their discography but I think a vast majority of their music has been so good. I think they do a great job of putting out music that always feels like it's theirs but never feels repetitive.   Phantom - Phantom can do no wrong in my eyes. I think Phantom Power is one of the most solid kpop albums ever and it was the first album I bought when I moved to Korea. They're just such a good team and they always make quality music. I'd listen to anything they put out.  For groups I would be tired of, I would probably pick VIXX. VIXX is easily one of my favorite groups ever but a lot of their charm for me  lies in their personalities and not their music. My opinions on their music are often all over the place. Sometimes they put out a song and I completely love it, sometimes it's pretty good, sometimes it's alright, and sometimes it's just not my style."

kpopslumberparty,31pcsj,kitchenmaniac111,14,Tue Apr 7 18:38:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going to get torn apart for this, but Taeyang and Junsu, for the exact same reason. I like them both, and love their music, but I can only listen to so much at a time of their solo stuff. I thoroughly appreciate their vocal control, because a lot of what they can do is hard, but they both sing so much with their throats and noses, and as a vocalist myself, that hard to ignore sometimes. In my opinion, in JYJ, both Jaejoong and Yoochun have a much more pleasant voice quality, and the same with Daesung in Big Bang."
kpopslumberparty,31pcsj,BrigidAndair,10,Tue Apr 7 04:10:17 2015 UTC,"GREAT. YOU AGAIN!   Lololol! Jk.  I see where you're coming from. I much prefer Taeyang when he's not nasal. He can dip down, though, and it sounds great!   I love ""Wings"" Daesung. When he's letting it all fly out. He uses head voice sometimes, and its warm and smoky and all that, but powerful voices deserve to be used.  I used to be ambivalent when it came to Junsu, but maybe I found more on this recent album?? Yoochun gets overlooked at times. Which is sad. He's my favorite!!"
kpopslumberparty,31pcsj,life-finds-a-way,4,Tue Apr 7 04:19:45 2015 UTC,"I KNOW, RIGHT? WHEN WILL I LEARN?!  The only bad thing I can really say about Daesung is that when he gets lower in his range, he tends to get very breathy, but when he lets it all go...that man has such a gorgeous voice!  I feel like with some proper vocal technique,  Taeyang would also have a pretty great voice, but you can hear the tightness in his throat more and more the higher he gets.  I really like Yoochun's voice, and I wish that he had more solos. I feel like he's horribly overshadowed by the other two because of their solo projects, and that's a real shame."
kpopslumberparty,31pcsj,BrigidAndair,3,Tue Apr 7 04:39:41 2015 UTC,"I KNOW, RIGHT? WHEN WILL I LEARN?!   IS WHAT I'M SAYING! I'm jokingly tagging you as ""Anti-Me"".   Agreed on Daesung. Given where he draws his air, his range, etc., it makes sense. That's the unfavorable part of his singing to me.  Is it improper technique with Taeyang? Overall? Or do you mean a proper way to resolve the tension in the nose and stuff? He sounds normal otherwise. I don't hear control or breathing issues when he does dip down.  I'm a shameless Yoochun fanboy. He can do no wrong. And he needs to be doing more."
kpopslumberparty,31pcsj,life-finds-a-way,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:17:19 2015 UTC,"Overall, actually. Even when he's going down lower, he's  running all of his tone through his nose, probably so that his tone stays more consistent. If you listen to the intro of Rise, he doesn't as much, but he gets a really odd tone quality on the lower notes, like he's trying to, but instead just forcing and aiming his air upwards. As his voice gets higher, it becomes more apparent that he doesn't support his voice with his air and diaphragm. Ways you can tell are the lack of vibrato (at all), which should be present on a healthy, supported tone automatically when it is sustained, the flatness of his overall vocal tone, and the tight lack of resonance of his notes. This all points to a severe lack of proper vocal technique, and is probably why he stays in the same small range in most of his songs. The one good thing that I can say is that he knows the limits of his style and stays within them.  Really, in all technical senses, he's the ""worst"" singer in BB. Seungri and Daesung show more benefits of training, where Taeyang has a lot of awful habits in the terms of healthy vocal technique.  Edit:: I forgot to address Junsu here. Junsu isn't nearly as bad as Taeyang, but he has a lot of the same habits, namely the nasal quality in his upper registers and the tendancy to control his pitch by tightening his throat on his ornamentation.  His tone quality and breath support tends to be better overall, which you can hear in the healthy vibrato he has on held notes. That’s also why his range is so much wider than Taeyang's. If he'd relax and learn how to let his air change his pitch on his ornamental runs and pull his tone out of his nose, I think I'd enjoy Junsu's singing a lot more."
kpopslumberparty,31pcsj,BrigidAndair,1 point,Tue Apr 7 08:51:35 2015 UTC,"the lack of vibrato (at all), which should be present on a healthy, supported tone automatically when it is sustained, the flatness of his overall vocal tone, and the tight lack of resonance of his notes   Holy crap.  I'm a violist-musician, so I am primarily aware of and tuned in to (no pun intended) harmony, blending, and overall fit of sound. But now that you bring that to my attention...good call.   he knows the limits of his style and stays within them   Yeah. And that's a good thing.  Uuuugh. Seungri! He doesn't get as much love as the other two. Not even taking into account what GD says, it's apparent (at least to me) from a song composition and sound level that BB tracks are either somehow built around Seungri's voice or they're written to take it into account.    pull his tone out of his nose   Which should be done for a good deal of vocalists, honestly."
kpopslumberparty,31pcsj,life-finds-a-way,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, especially about Taeyang. I don't think he's a great singer (Junsu is more consistent, imo) - Taeyang has a really nice tone but his singing is so nasal and choppy, it's hard to listen to especially during lives where he has the tendency to strain and go flat. Sometimes his voice just doesn't sound like it's there during live performances compared to Daesung's."
kpopslumberparty,31pcsj,haru_69,18,Tue Apr 7 16:55:20 2015 UTC,"Hyuna.    She's a crappy singer, but I'll admit that she's not a bad rapper. It's a shame though. I mean, in some of the older videos you can dig up of her on YouTube where she's rapping without a backing track (mostly when she was still in Wonder Girls) she's actually got a strong voice. But now so many of her video clips (both solo and with 4minute) are just her doing obviously-sexy face, and her voice in live performances is weak or drowned out by background music. I guess it's not entirely her fault since she wouldn't be making her career decisions on her own, but I wish Cube would've promoted her differently to being more than just a sex symbol. If anything, I wish Cube would promote Jiyoon as a solo artist because she's got an awesome voice and can rap just as well as Hyuna."
kpopslumberparty,31pcsj,SunsetFlare,3,Tue Apr 7 03:20:59 2015 UTC,I love Jiyoon and she is definitely charismatic and talented.  She's got some issues with singing though that came out during Immortal Song  and her solo release.  2yoon deserves another shot.

Rap Mon & Zico were ahead of him while he was 3rd in one of them and 4th when Mino was ahead of him too. BI is not that great of a rapper, he's similar to GD but with less charisma and he was awful in SMTM.

Before they even debuted I could tell she would have an inordinate amount of praise from that female i-fan community simply because of the way she looks, it's like people just rush to defend the less good-looking members because they think they're the most talented or something, it's feels really disingenuous and almost patronizing."

kpopslumberparty,31jcgz,majekmistake,2,Sun Apr 5 23:40:41 2015 UTC,They must have gotten cold feet when they realized the effect it would have on all their fanfiction authors. (Although the teaser stuff probably sealed that deal already.)

kpopslumberparty,31j4lf,majekmistake,2,Sun Apr 5 21:51:53 2015 UTC,"I had no idea Starship or SM were prepping boy groups, I need to pay more attention! I'll wait to pass my judgement until they've released their songs because, as someone who doesn't watch singing competition shows, I've never heard any of them sing or seen them perform. Judging on their looks alone, I think the Monsta X boys generally look a bit older than the other groups, which I am a fan of because I'm not a teenager anymore. I do like multicultural groups though so SR15B has me intrigued with an American, a Japanese member, and a Thai member(who may be half Chinese?). Also, I am usually not big on YG groups. I typically like some of their songs and listen to them every once in a while but I've never really gotten really into a YG group. But hey, who know, iKON could be my first YG stan!"

Like with fictional character, big deal, writer should have control. With real people... they have their own thoughts and motivations but then fic writers ascribe traits to them that may or may not be accurate to real life and that's weird to me."
kpopslumberparty,31gq75,gimmemoresalad,11,Sun Apr 5 00:00:12 2015 UTC,"I get you, but also, you can think of their celebrity ""persona"" as a sort of character.   I think Real Person Fic is kinda weird, too, but it's also a huge guilty pleasure for me, so I try not to think too hard about that :P"
kpopslumberparty,31gq75,dupilumab,15,Sun Apr 5 02:51:28 2015 UTC,"I mean, I don't know. I actually seem to read it more for the writing quality than the fanfiction part if I happen to read it (I don't read very often now). I cannot read a fanfic that is written poorly. But some fanfic writers are so amazing and their stories are so creative. Especially some EXO fans, wow, their stories could be legit novels in a bookstore. I think in cases like that, using idols just makes the reader be able to envision the characters better. It's not like authors really stay true to the idols personalities, it's more about just what they look like and the rest is original. So it's really not that weird."
kpopslumberparty,31gq75,nlnynt,2,Sat Apr 4 23:00:52 2015 UTC,"I agree! For me, at least, RPF is more of using idols as a basis for creative plots and story-telling and developing characters, rather than actually viewing the people themselves as how they're portrayed in the stories.  And yes, there's so much good writing out there. I would actually buy some of those stories in store. Especially in a fandom as huge as EXO, there's tons of memorable classics and hidden gems.

I'd really think of it as just them using the idols as a basis though, because it's not like anyone believes the idols are a certain way because of the fanfics. IDK, it's a weird topic. I don't really think it's harmful though unless people actually start believing it is real, and in that case they must have other issues."

I used to read Damon and Elena fanfic back when I shipped them really hard and they weren't a couple yet on Vamp Diaries."
kpopslumberparty,31gq75,majekmistake,8,Sun Apr 5 04:42:03 2015 UTC,"When I was younger I was super into anime and I was all about fanfics then (reading and writing them) but I naturally fell out of the fanfic game as my interest in anime waned. One day I randomly decided to go back and check out my old fic hangouts and I was actually surprised to see that most of them on those sites now are about real people instead of anime or book characters because back in my day it was only fictional characters.  These days, I don't read fanfics but I feel like they're pretty harmless. In my opinion, it's no different than people fantasizing about them in their heads, which is completely normal since idols are public figures who are in the business of dialing into fantasies. I think it only gets weird when fans start reading/writing fics and believing the traits the author gave them to be true of the idols themselves."

There are some well-written fanfiction out there, but I don't really like the idea of treating people like characters. I generally don't judge people for writing them unless they start acting like the people are actually characters or start confusing their fictions with reality. I think that most people just kind of use fanfiction as a stepping stone to creating their own original stories, which is pretty cool, I guess."

So I'll give you five each at random.  EXO- cathedral city Krishan taking a road trip, On Cats and Counting Calories really amazing Tao-centric/Laytao, Mooncakes and Romance hilarious Xiuhan where Luhan's a psycho (lol), All I want from you is to see you tomorrow (and every tomorrow) really nice Taohun model!au, three is company (and two is none) polyamorous Tao/Chen/Kai  VIXX- reticent Leo centric/Neo and my absolute favorite fic ever, repose companion to reticent, evaporate great dom!n and sub!leo, curls and curves Neo where Leo crossdresses for N, stargazer Keo where Ken's a star that falls from the sky.

Because I used to write, I'm actually quite excited to meet people in real life who also write fics. I never had a friend who shared the same fandom obsessions like me so it's nice to talk to people about how they write their fics and what their point of view is..   I see fanfiction as just fun.. It's always nice to fantasize about things happening and as long as it doesn't get leaked out of the fandom (and people don't get delusional and take the shipping a little too seriously) I think it's harmless.."

With that being said though, I don't actively look for fanfictions to read. I just don't like the idea of sharing your fantasies about idols, especially if the fanfiction sexualizes them and the person is serious about it. That just makes me think, ""what the hell is going on with that person's mind to have such fantasies like that?"" I guess it's okay to fantasize about idols every once in a while, but they should try to keep it to themselves."
kpopslumberparty,31gq75,gimmemoresalad,3,Sun Apr 5 04:34:52 2015 UTC,"Ohhh boy. IDK if I feel quite anonymous enough in KSP to talk about this... but I'm too lazy to make a throwaway username, so here goes nothing lol... don't judge me guys omg   Have you ever read any kpop fanfiction?   Yes   Does it make you uncomfortable?   Not when it's well-written. I understand the ways and reasons that it makes others uncomfortable, and I agree with most of their arguments actually, but it's a guilty pleasure and I love it anyway.   How would you judge someone who writes these stories?   Depends on their writing :P I should probably just go ahead and out myself now and admit that I'm really into smut fics, so... I'm not going to judge people for that (unless it sucks, in which case... oh, well, practice makes perfect, I guess? But if it sucks, I'm not going to read it.)   What are some of your favorite fanfics you've ever read?   My bias is going to be super incredibly obvious here (not that it isn't usually)...  Not smut:   On the hit list (wanted in the telephone book) - Block B - told through text messages, very very funny, highly recommend Truth in Fiction - Block B - does a great job of staying true to personalities, very all-around awesome Whispering - Block B - very cute Taepyo fluff The Roof Garden - Block B - not smut, but rated M. Seriously intense, violent, and yet very beautiful. Highly recommended (not just by me, but by most fic rec lists around), but seriously - brace yourself and make sure you're ready before diving into this piece.   Smut:   Let's Play a Game - BTS, first-person female POV Hyung, I need you - Block B - Taepyo - author said she wrote it in 10 minutes, so it's a little rough in places, but a gem nonetheless Giving In - Block B - Taepyo - really cute Goldfish and Lollipop Sticks - Block B - You & Taeil & Pyo (but not Taepyo) - 2nd person female ""you"" POV"

I usually just stick to EXO fanfiction just because there is so so much of it, and it's not difficult to find good ones, but lately I've been exploring more groups.   Which one did you write? I wanna read it first :D  Edit: I've always been too scared to read BTS fanfic because they're all my absolute favorites and I'm scared my lovely image of them in my mind will be tainted, so that's where I draw the line.

kpopslumberparty,31gq75,PottersPhoenix,2,Sun Apr 5 05:37:19 2015 UTC,"Well, it's almost 5:00am here right now, and i just finished reading your fanfic, so I might as well share my thoughts now because who needs sleep, right? Get ready for a long-ass post mwahaha  First of all, I'm pleasantly surprised about how much I enjoyed this fanfic, considering it was a ""___ & You"" type of fic, and those tend to be a complete hit or (more often than not) miss, but this was definitely a hit, so be proud of yourself, this doesn't happen that often! It didn't give off the sort of uncomfortable, creepy(?) sort of vibe that I usually get from themthank god. It had the perfect balance of smut and fluff (their relationship was adorable hehe) that didn't make me feel dirty after reading it, like some smut sometimes does. Also, A+ for general snarkiness from everyone.  Next up, thank you, thank you, thank you for actually writing with proper grammar and spelling omg. You do not know how much it drives me insane when a fanfic with so much potential is written by someone who appears to have failed 3rd grade English. Another thing is that you actually used pronouns. While you may be like ""ok wtf this chick be smoking, what's the big deal about pronouns?,"" you do not realize how much I am tired of hearing ""the brunette,"" ""the older male,"" or anything along those lines instead of a basic ass ""he."" The correct term for these are ""epithets,"" and they are better explained here. But honestly, your writing was on point, and it was super easy to picture everything that was happening, so give yourself a pat on the back.  Now I'm just gonna quote some stuff and talk about it because I don't know how else to do this, I've never written a review (is this even a review? idk..) of anything like this before.   “You sly motherfucker,” you mumbled, trying hard to vent your surprise without actually talking over the music video. Taeil giggled at your shock, and when his part came around a second time, he sang along at full volume, perfectly matching the recording.  Jihoon gestured for you to crouch next to the couch near Taeil’s head. You were a bit wary about what the boy might be up to, but you went along with it anyway. Jihoon stood by the arm rest of the couch and leaned down near Taeil’s face. His nose scrunched up as a big smile spread across his face, then he licked his lips and planted a big, wet kiss right on the apple of Taeil’s cheek.   Both of them were such trolls and I loved it.   ""Are you inviting me to spend the night, then?” he asked. He took a step to stand very close to you, looking down at your face, giggling.   This for some reason reminded me of this part in their ""Jackpot"" music video, and I didn't even mind.   Kyung was the one who took your offered handshake and pulled your hand to his lips, kissing your knuckles while looking deep into your eyes.   Hahaha this greasy motherfucker.   He tasted like vodka and cranberries   Vodka and cranberries, original description, I like it.  Okay, okay, I think I'm done.   TL;DR: Lovely fic overall, I'm happy you know English, I don't know how to review stuff, and this post took forever to write. Whatever, I'm happy with it.  It's been a pleasure discussing fanfiction with you, and I hope to read more from you in the future! K byeeeeee. :D  Edit: Formatting."

I feel bad for even having a ranking but yeah I do.  2NE1 - Dara: She's pretty, she's kind, she's a vampire who doesn't age, she seems like a good friend but artistically I feel like she doesn't really add much to the group.  Big Bang - Daesung: I know he's technically the best vocalist in Big Bang but something about his public persona just seems a bit too...idk...naive/happy go lucky to me. Eventhough I have followed BB for years, I still feel like I don't really know anything about him. Part of the blame for this probably goes to YG as well for not giving him the same kind of solo opportunities as to the other members to establish his own brand.  SHINee - Minho: I'm just not a fan of SM rappers in general and he's just always been the one that never really stood out to me in any way.  WINNER - Jinwoo: He's incredibly pretty with his Luhan-esque looks, super hard-working and all around adorable but again...the other members all have so much creative potential that they overshadow Jinwoo in my eyes.

I'm very fond of the members but Infinite are the only ones where I individually follow the members and what they're doing outside of the group. Other than that I mostly just like individual idols (who are sometimes members of guy groups e.g. N from VIXX) and girl groups.

But what I like(?) about Tiffany is that she never seems to be taking anything for granted? She always seems to be giving it her all, or at least a lot of it. To the point where it can be grating as fuck (trying way too hard and shit).  She has always given me the impression that this is what she 100% WANTS to do. Especially in the beginning, but even now I still get that vibe. It's just nice seeing an idol who really fucking loves their job.   There's a lot of things she does that really bother me, or make me cringe, or what have you, but most of them kinda seem to stem from that love, so...¯\(ツ)/¯ yeah I dunno."

Luhan, chanyeol, baekhyun used to  tease them about their dark skin and how it looks black or something. I know dark skin is unappealing in Korea, but really? You sound like 5 year olds. And it's obvious that they're self conscious of it as a result, which is a shame,  because I really adore their dark skin. Bleh."

They're just consistently mean to Tao to the point of me sometimes wishing Tao would leave the group too because he looks so unhappy. At least Sehun is his friend though! The only reason I ever liked Kris was because he was really nice to Tao.
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,dupilumab,5,Sat Apr 4 18:44:35 2015 UTC,"Which is probably why Tao took Kris' leave the hardest(?) out of the entire group; Kris treated him very well, same goes with Sehun's friendship. And I believe Tao has made a comment or two about Kai, but what the others say to him seem to outweigh that. It makes me mad, actually, that Baekhyun and Chanyeol actively dismiss him so often and play it off as a joke. Like, no. (As you can see, I treasure Tao immensely :3)"

Do they have a high point? How was that particular group of people selected as SM's new flagship boygroup? Am I missing something?"
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,dupilumab,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"Do you mean like you don't like them and don't get why they were selected?  I mean, they are pretty talented and they're good looking. The whole skin thing isn't an issue over there. I think some of them have shitty personalities but whatever. Personally I found M more entertaining/interesting but with four chinese members and the racism in korea that would have never worked for those people being marketed in korea by themselves. I think they're entertaining when they're all together. I think however before you actually get into them K draws you in more than M does...like I liked K much better until I learned of their personalities and more details. Kai and Sehun are entertaining as hell though. Kai is just so awkward offstage (and nice) and then onstage he acts like a psycho.   But yes anyway I think they were selected because at first glance they come off as entertaining and not malicious/rude and you wouldn't really see them that way unless you became a fan (and by that point you're probably already sucked in anyway so who cares). Plus they probably behaved better as trainees who were desperate to be picked."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,iampotato_worshipme,3,Sun Apr 5 17:39:06 2015 UTC,"Hm, guess they're just still not my cup of tea. Exo-M has the only visually interesting members (completely subjective obviously,) and even the talented members of Exo-K just do... nothing for me, or turn me off with some implied personality thing. Even if I'm not that into them, I can see it in the way they generally act. You know how there are those boygroups that immediately seem fun and fairly chill, like SHINee and BTS? EXO, especially Exo-K members, gives me the exact opposite of that impression for some reason.  Sigh I know that this is probably just my perception of them though, so I was just wondering what Exo-K fans saw in them, instead. Thanks for answering. :)"

This is also the reason I don't like Leo from VIXX. I also am not a fan of how Kyungsoo has a tendency to hit the other members or ""punish"" them or whatever.

kpopslumberparty,31efgq,dupilumab,3,Sat Apr 4 13:56:18 2015 UTC,"I am typically very main vocal biased and after main vocals, I go for lead vocals then sub vocals so my least favorite members are often the rappers of the groups. That doesn't mean I necessarily dislike them, I just don't really like rap that much so, unless they've got an awesome personality or stage presence, they tend to go unnoticed by me. That's why Ravi in VIXX, Minho in SHINee, Kiggen in Phantom, Mir in MBLAQ, Mark in GOT7, Ilhoon in BtoB, Kwangmin in Boyfriend, and Baro in B1A4 are all my least favorites in their respective groups. I'm sure they're perfectly nice guys who are talented in their own right, but they're just not really on my radar.  In EXO I've only got eyes for Chen so I'm pretty apathetic about all of the members but I think it's especially bad with Suho and Sehun. I forget they're in the group all the time and it took me a long time to tell them apart."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,minniewheats,6,Sat Apr 4 16:41:19 2015 UTC,"Shinee: Minho. He's just not that talented or up to par with the rest of them and his face is weirdly small. He's gotten better but again his face is still small. Also he just is so awkward I feel awkward. Favorite members-Key and Jonghyun.   EXO: Baekhyun and Chanyeol. I actually have gotten better with my dislike for them but they seem kind of rude. Same with Kyungsoo, he seems genuinely moody. It's funny as an outsider but I imagine it might be annoying as someone who personally knows him. If we count old members then Kris tops the list.  Favorites- Lay, Tao, Sehun, Lulu   Red Velvet: Wendy because she's a racist bish. And she is such an attention whore it is really frustrating. I really do not like her. I'm indifferent towards Yeri because she can't seem to sing or dance or rap or anything so I hope she gets better. Her personality seems very nice. Favorites- the rest of them, I wish Seulgi, Irene, and Joy had a subunit. The love I feel for them is no joke they're so gorgeous and perfect and oh my god pukes rainbows   SNSD: if she still counts, then Jessica. Not because of what happened but because I just thought she always came off as cold and rude. Favorites- Taeyeon, Sunny  BTS: Jimin and Jin because they don't seem useful and I'm sorry but Jimin really bothers me for some reason. Favorites- V, Rap Monster"

kpopslumberparty,31efgq,kc501,5,Mon Apr 6 05:15:46 2015 UTC,"Kyungsoo has an interesting kind of humor. Very deadpan sometimes to the point where you don't know whether he's serious or not. His vocals are awesome though, so I'm okay with it.  Baekhyun and Chanyeol need to grow up. How Baekhyun managed to snag Taeyeon I have no clue.  Wendy turned me off of Red Velvet initially with her idiotic comments. Otherwise, Red Velvet is pretty awesome with their f(x)/SNSD mix kind of music. I'm digging their album."

Also, Kai is a super talented dancer and I don't dislike him at all I just think he's overrated a little bit. He's definitely a top dancer in kpop but Lay definitely gives him a run for his money. He absolutely slayed in the Call Me Baby mv. My eyes always go right to him."

kpopslumberparty,31efgq,BrigidAndair,4,Mon Apr 6 11:16:51 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of groups I really like, so please bear with me.  It takes a whole lot for me to like a vocally weaker member of a group more than a stronger one, so you'll see a lot of that happening here.  I've also included my favorite member at the end of each section for contrast.   B.A.P: Youngjae - Don't get me wrong, I love every member of B.A.P, but if I had to choose one that I liked the least, it would be Youngjae.  Compared to the others, I honestly find him a bit boring, and his singing, while not bad, isn't as full and rich as I tend to like (see: Daehyun).  Favorite Member: Jongup Big Bang: Seungri - Again, I don't not like Seungri.  I like him quite a bit. In fact, I absolutely adore his solo stuff, but on Big Bang tracks, there's not anything he does that Daesung or Taeyang can't. Favorite Member: Daesung BTS: Jin - You know what, I'm just gonna make a blanket statement that I don't dislike any of the people on this list (with the exception of one, and I bet you can guess who) right now.  Vocally, Jin isn't as strong as Jungkook or Jimin, nor does he have as unique a voice as V, and I love the shit out of the entire rap line, so he's stuck here in the last spot.  Favorite Member: J-Hope Block B: U-Kwon - Before I saw them live, I probably would have chosen Jaehyo here, but after hearing how perfect his voice was in concert, I couldn't.  U-Kwon is a good vocalist, but I honestly feel like they should even out his lines with Jaehyo more, because, in my opinion, he's not as good as Jaehyo is.  Favorite Member: Taeil U-KISS: Kevin (was Dongho) - Because he's brand new to the group (and I like what I've heard of his voice so far), I'm giving Jun amnesty from this decision.  Kevin seems really, really sweet, and like an awesome guy to hang out with, but his voice is a little too nasally for me, and it honestly ticks me off a little that he gets so much more attention than any other member of the group.  Favorite Memeber: Soohyun Cross Gene: Seyoung - On album, he sounds just fine, but Seyoung has some pitch control issues when he sings live, and tends to have too much air and not enough support in his voice.  Favorite Member: Takuya (was J.G) EXO: Sehun (was Kris) - I just don't like his rapping.  That's about it.  Favorite Member: Tao, Kai (was Luhan) TVXQ: Younho - Sorry, Younho.  I just love Changmin's voice too much to choose you over him.  Favorite Member: Changmin M.I.B: Cream - 5zic and SIMS are such strong rappers, and Kangnam adds the much needed vocals to the group.  Cream isn't anywhere near bad, but I just don't feel that he's as strong as the others.  Favorite Member: SIMS Phantom: Kiggan - This was hard for me.  I love Kiggan's rapping.  But with Sanchez's voice and Hanhae being a singing/rapping dream package, that leaves Kiggan. :(  Favorite Member: Hanhae JYJ: Yoochun - I love his acting, but I'm a lot less enamored with his singing voice.  Compared to Jaejoong and Junsu, I just don't feel like he matches up.  Still better than a lot of idol singers, though, but TVXQ/JYJ were always way above the bar in the vocal department.  Favorite Member: Jaejoong SHINee: Minho - Though it's gotten better drastically since debut, I still can't enjoy Minho's rapping.  Favorite Member: Onew SS501: Kim Hyunjoong - Aside from the whole domestic abuse issue, I've always cringed really hard whenever he ""raps"".  I've liked a lot of his solo stuff, but he doesn't compare at all with Jungmin or Youngsaeng.  Favorite Member: Jungmin VIXX: Ravi - I think he's awesome, but, again, I just don't like his rapping.  He is getting better, though, so maybe my opinion will change if that trend continues, but for right now, he's in the last spot.  Favorite Member: Ken   Edit:: Added a couple groups I had forgotten."

Then again, that little nerd is my second favorite, and maybe I'm just too biased(?) I don't want to force anyone to think something they already don't.   Seungri's technical skill might not be as high, but his behind-the-vocals contributions and abilities are on par."

kpopslumberparty,31efgq,kpoopy,3,Sat Apr 4 18:55:40 2015 UTC,"I hope this doesn't turn into a super long thing:  Monster: here (Daesung to Taeyang to Seungri)  Daesung and Taeyang sing the chorus. You have a powerful and full voice to start, and then something...stable. Taeyang is mostly in head voice, so it's higher in pitch but still the voice we all know.  The song then cools off and gets lighter. You're down to a piano instrumental, essentially, and there needs to be a voice that's light enough to keep up and not overtake it. Daesung can D'liver falsetto. As can Taeyang. But their voices are too heavy to mix voice and falsetto like Seungri does, ""You don't say that tomorrooowww..."", and be sweet like that.  Love Song: here (Taeyang to Seungri)  The first verse and the bridge were sung by huskier voices. The chorus is set up to be powerful and light. Taeyang is using his head voice as usual. It's a bit high, and the song (for me at least) has to go down next. But not so much like Daesung.     So as vocalists, Taeyang and Daesung can do what Seungri does. For sure. But not the way he does it. I just interpreted what you said as ""there's not anything he does Daesung or Taeyang can't do exactly."" It also helps that there has to be a fifth voice and the songs were all written with each part and singer in mind. You could double up on a verse, but the song would have to be written to allow for that.  Seungri is the balance. He's sweet when Daesung and Taeyang are powerful, and then light but powerful when Taeyang is higher and a bit nasal."

When he tries to act sexy I just cringe. I was showing my mom CMB and when it got too suho winking she was like ""ok dis too much wtf was that turn this off that was so weird""."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,minniewheats,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:31:29 2015 UTC,the cringey things he does are easily avoidable and sometimes he tries to be too serious. if he could find a middle ground between those and take a second to think before he acts i would like him more
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,kc501,5,Sat Apr 4 19:09:59 2015 UTC,"Rap Monster dances with his face, and I can never decide whether I want to cringe or laugh.  I used to not like him in terms of personality all that much, but recently I've come to respect him a lot. He is extremely talented and hard working, and I can't imagine BTS without him.  This is the video that changed my mind about him."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,_cornflake,5,Sat Apr 4 18:47:14 2015 UTC,i don't understand why people say jin is the worst at dancing when theres rap monsters dance face tbh
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,kc501,5,Sat Apr 4 19:21:05 2015 UTC,"Rap Monster  Jin   I think it's pretty safe to say they're both terrible.  I still love them for it though, so it's okay ♥"
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,sprittany,8,Sat Apr 4 19:25:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. I feel bad for saying it because of how Suho had trained for so many years, but Suho doesn't stand out to me in any way. I mean, he's handsome, and I even heard about how he has the most perfect face according to plastic surgeons, but that's about it. His vocals are meh, his personality is meh, his role as a leader is meh, everything is meh IMO. On the other side, while baekhyun had only trained for less than a year, he stands out to me vocally and with his personality much more than Suho, sadly. Sorry to those who like Suho, but this is how I see him."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,kaltraa93,3,Sat Apr 4 18:16:31 2015 UTC,trained for so many years   considering his family and position that's probably the problem
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,kc501,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:53:44 2015 UTC,True
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,kc501,4,Sat Apr 4 18:55:52 2015 UTC,"I can already tell that I'll be reprimanded for these, but:  BTS Jungkook - I'm a huge BTS fan and I appreciate each member so, so much. However. Jungkook's schtick in teasing and joking about Jimin hits me in a bad way. I don't think he's done anything like that recently (I could be completely wrong), but some of his past comments/actions still leave me with a slightly negative impression.  VIXX Hongbin - Him constantly pointing out and commenting on N's skin color just straight up pisses me off.  EDIT: That is to say, I don't hate these two. It's just that some of the things they've said and/or done has me view them in a less than positive way."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,kc501,9,Sat Apr 4 18:48:09 2015 UTC,Hongbin comes off as a straight up asshole a lot of the time - it's not just the skin color comments but the general 'I don't like you' attitude he has to N. A couple of the other members do it as well (this is really the main reason I gave up following the group tbh).
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,silversam,6,Sat Apr 4 21:19:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've heard and seen the other members do the same thing towards N. The members individually have issues..."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,dupilumab,3,Sat Apr 4 23:00:49 2015 UTC,I agree on Hongbin. In my comment I said I didn't have a member like this for VIXX but if I'm being completely honest with myself... It's him orz. (Still kinda love him tho...)
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,kc501,2,Sat Apr 4 23:20:58 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you about Jungkook, but since he's so popular I thought I wasn't gonna see him on this thread. When I first got into BTS, I immediately loved all the members except Jungkook. I don't know why but I just didn't warm up to him right away, and I think a big reason is how he treats some of the members, particularly Jimin (which probably annoyed me more than most since I am Jimin biased). Now though, I've warmed up to him a lot more cause I see how passionate and hard-working he is, and he's cute too. But yeah, he definitely left a sour impression on me in the beginning."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,iampotato_worshipme,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:59:52 2015 UTC,"Oh yay~ Haha, yeah, I was a bit hesitant in writing about Jungkook, but I felt that the Redditors in this sub would be understanding and respect what I had to say. Which they did :D  I still have a wishy-washy opinion on Jungkook, but there's no denying that he puts so much effort into everything he does and strives to be the best that he can be. I truly admire him for that, especially at his age."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,VariantIN,3,Wed Apr 8 04:24:50 2015 UTC,"You have to admit, Jungkookie is fucking adorable though.  Hongbin too."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,silversam,3,Sat Apr 4 19:09:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, definitey! Again, I hold nothing against them to the point that I strongly dislike them. It's just...IDK, some of the things they've done is problematic and not okay."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,VariantIN,3,Sat Apr 4 19:12:19 2015 UTC,I can respect that.   Honestly my comment was just an excuse to share a few of my (too many) gifs of these two. Sorry not sorry
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,Littlemallow,2,Sat Apr 4 19:20:34 2015 UTC,Haha not a problem at all! GIFs are always welcome :3
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,justfornothing,9,Sat Apr 4 19:28:33 2015 UTC,"Group Member Explanation    EXO Tao I find him really unattractive (especially coming from SM) and he doesn't bring anything to the group talent-wise, so I just don't understand why he's in EXO. Considering the competition between trainees, I think he took someone else's spot who deserved it more.   Shinee Key I think he's a diva and not the good kind. Kind of a snob (based purely on his TV personality, he's probably not like this in real life)   Infinite Sungjong I'm usually fine with gender benders like Ren and him, but Sungjong makes me really uncomfortable for some reason. I can't really explain it, he just weirds me out.   GOT7 BamBam & Yugyeom Considering GOT7 ship themselves more than their fans, I find the lack of shipping fanservice from these two sorely lacking so I stuck them there by default.   BTS Suga BTS is a clusterfuck of embarrassment and hilarity, but Suga rarely participates, so I feel like he's kind of a party-pooper.   FT Island Hongki I put him there just out resentment for the lack of activities for the rest of the members. Probably not his fault, but I need more Minhwan in my life.   BTOB Eunkwang or Peniel Eunkwang because he's the least attractive and because he lacks dignity (especially as a leader). I actually like Peniel, but objectively he has no business being an idol. BTOB has a really high average for vocals and he brings it down a lot.   B.A.P. Himchan I don't get the point of him. I know he's the visual, but honestly, the rest of the group is doing fine in the looks department with Daehyun alone.    Honestly, most of these people I just ignore. The only one I actively dislike is Tao. We could have had Jino ffs!!! T_T  EDIT: Please don't downvote me for answering the question.  TAO EDIT: Most comments seem to be about Tao, so I'll just explain more here. My main issue with Tao is his looks. I think that in the context of kpop, visuals are pretty important and a legitimate reason to deny someone from joining a group. To me, Tao is easily one of the least attractive SM male (second only to Shindong). I think he actually brings down the average visual of his group. If he had been a main dancer/vocal, I would have ignored it since his usefulness would have lied elsewhere, but he's not. Sehun gets a pass as an visual member (and wasn't he supposed to be lead dancer of EXO-K?). If you're useless and attractive, that's fine. If you're useless and unattractive, then why are you even there?"
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,silversam,14,Sat Apr 4 12:32:30 2015 UTC,"My eyes are twitching at key and tao right now but I mean it's your opinion.   Tao is actually pretty talented IMO but he just never gets the chance to show it off. He can rap really well, he can dance well, and he is definitely not the worst singer in the group. I personally find him super attractive but I that's just preference.   I've never seen key be mean on TV...he actually seems incredibly sweet. Do you know any specific instances that caused you to not like him?"
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,maydaysoup,4,Sat Apr 4 18:25:33 2015 UTC,Agreement on Tao :3
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,xiuhans,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:34:45 2015 UTC,"I agree. Plus, I'm a die hard EXO fan, but I don't find half of them attractive... But appearance is literally the last thing I look for in a kpop group/idol, so i dunno..."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,sprittany,13,Tue Apr 7 18:32:39 2015 UTC,I find it kind of amusing that the people you don't care for are actually my favourites in their respective groups (even if I'm not a fan of the majority of these groups).
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,silversam,4,Sat Apr 4 13:46:40 2015 UTC,You should post who you don't like in those groups so we can find out if the reverse is also true.
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,sprittany,4,Sat Apr 4 13:50:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know enough about most of these groups but the ones I do have favourites in are EXO, SHINee and BTS (my favourites being Tao, Key and Rapmon/Suga). Except for Minho being the one that I feel the most indifferent about in SHINee, I don't really have clear rankings for the other groups. In BTS for example I only really know of/follow Rapmon and Suga."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,kc501,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:08:32 2015 UTC,A lot of them are my faves too. This post is almost a week old but I'm having heart palpitations reading this list. Tao? Poor Tao is so sweet and uniquely adorable. Suga is sweg and a sweetie. HIMCHAN?! His whole purpose is to be beautiful. And I fucking love Sungjong so much that I could cry. HOW. WHY. HOW IS THIS A POSSIBLE WAY TO FEEL MY HEARTEU IS OH MY GOD  however since we all have a right to feel how we wanna feel i will accept this in the name of fairness and friendship   ... but it still hurts  a lot
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,silversam,12,Fri Apr 10 18:18:14 2015 UTC,"I can see why you would feel that way about suga but personally it doesn't bother me. Not everyone has a ridiculously silly personality and honestly I think he's just too old for that shit, lol. In the bangtan bombs you see him here and there joining in so I wouldn't really call him a party pooper, he just isn't a hyper young thing like the maknae line. While he isn't my favorite (in fact, it's funny that I'm defending his honor because he probably is my least favorite too) I still like suga and appreciate his presence in the group because he's very serious about his music and he's an excellent rapper. Plus Tomorrow was so damn good!"
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,kpoopy,3,Sat Apr 4 16:34:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, definitely. I just put him there by default because the other members amuse me so much."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,silversam,1 point,Sat Apr 4 19:30:33 2015 UTC,"Gurgh I'm never sure how to feel about Suga, myself. He's incredibly talented and pretty good-looking, and normally I wouldn't mind the IRL passiveness if he had an interesting on-stage personality, but.... That one scene in Boy in Luv turned me off BTS for a whole year, although I've heard stories that he was really apologetic to the girl about it throughout the filming and wasn't that into it himself? So IDK what to think about him.  TL;DR he's introverted offstage and on-stage, he was given the role of an abusive dick. I really appreciate and respect his work in both rap and production, but his image could use a little redemption imo....."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,xiuhans,5,Sun Apr 5 17:41:15 2015 UTC,Do you think Sehun is more talented than Tao? I think Tao raps well (for SM standards) and he also does wushu
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,silversam,17,Sat Apr 4 15:16:00 2015 UTC,This is what I thought... Not trying to be mean or disrespect others' opinions but how can you say Tao has no talent when there's Sehun.
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,funwithgoats,2,Sat Apr 4 16:03:45 2015 UTC,"Waiting for the day Sehun gets to sing (not ""say"") a full line"
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,silversam,2,Sat Apr 4 16:32:42 2015 UTC,"This is gonna sound harsh, but I actually think Tao is unattractive, not just less attractive than the rest of the members, but actually unattractive. He brings down the average looks of his groups.  God, that sounds so horrible. I'm sorry!!!"
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,justfornothing,3,Sat Apr 4 19:28:12 2015 UTC,"I don't really care about you thinking he's not attractive, since everyone has different tastes when it comes to looks. I just don't get how you think he's useless... He's pretty great at rapping, he's always been one of the main rappers and now that Kris is gone he's all M has (besides Xiumin... sort of....). His dancing isn't bad as well."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,BrigidAndair,5,Sat Apr 4 23:00:32 2015 UTC,"I became a very strong Tao stan after this comeback, and, looking back to past videos and performances, he's not useless. Not as out-there in terms of popularity, but definitely not a deadweight. At this point, EXO-M needs Tao more than ever."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,jsalad,2,Sat Apr 4 23:09:28 2015 UTC,"When it comes to idols, I consider visuals as an asset you can bring to the group which is why I mention it. Having good visuals is very valuable, so I definitely think it's valid to consider it when evaluating usefulness.  Rapping in kpop is mostly a joke so I don't even consider it as a real position (with the exception of people like Rapmon, GD, Zico, etc.)   Basically, I evaluate usefulness in kpop using three factors: singing, dancing, visuals. Tao fails at singing and visuals while he's average at dancing. Xiumin, on the other hand, wins at visual, is one of the best dancers after Kai and Lay (becoming lead dancer for EXO-M after Luhan left) and hasn't been shown singing (as far as I know), so I can't comment on that."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,kc501,2,Sat Apr 4 23:26:00 2015 UTC,"even though tao is my favorite i think he's unattractive, but he has his moments especially lately and he's much better than kris at everything."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,majekmistake,2,Sat Apr 4 23:51:20 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I've never paid much attention to Sehun, but back during their debut I was under the impression he was lead dancer of EXO-K (after Kai), so I automatically filed him into the ""useful"" category.  There's also the fact that he is way more attractive than Tao (IMO), so he can also be considered a visual (which is a position I consider legitimate in the Kpop world)."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,kc501,2,Sat Apr 4 19:16:50 2015 UTC,And Tao being the main rapper of Exo M doesnt make him useful? I hope I'm not coming off as aggressive lol I just honestly can't see how you think Tao is useless when he's the main rapper AND does wushu.. Like I think Xiumin has fewer lines than Tao and he's not the dancer of Exo M either
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,justfornothing,-1,Sat Apr 4 21:06:48 2015 UTC,"Just to give you an idea, I consider visual a more legitimate position than rapper when it comes to most groups. There is no rapper in EXO or any SM group for that matter. It's basically a made-up position given to those who aren't singers/dancers.   As far as I'm concerned, there are three legitimate roles in an idol group: singer, dancer and visual (with rapper being a special category reserved for the likes of RapMon, GD and Zico). Everyone in EXO fits somewhere in those three categories except for Tao (in my opinion, of course. Some people find Tao attractive)."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,dupilumab,1 point,Sat Apr 4 21:29:25 2015 UTC,I thought Sehun got flack for being a 'lazy dancer' or something? I didn't realize he was supposed to be a dancer.
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,DirtyDerpina,1 point,Mon Apr 6 09:59:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know anymore. When EXO debuted, I was under the impression that he was supposed to be a dancer, especially since he exclusively danced during his pre-debut teasers.   However, a lot of people have been mentioning him as the useless one over Tao (who was relegated to martial arts for his teaser), so I don't know anymore."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,immyongsoo,0,Mon Apr 6 11:33:03 2015 UTC,"I think tao raps well enough but the wushu shtick is so secondhand embarrassing ""/. It'd be alright if he had time to practice and devote to it but he ends up making mistakes and hurting himself and I've just never liked it from the beginning."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,maydaysoup,3,Sat Apr 4 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"I definitely understand about Himchan.  I believe that his purpose in the group is mostly related to his MCing, acting, charisma, and personality on the (few) variety shows that they've been on.  He takes risks on camera, and that makes him interesting to watch.  I just wish they'd let him sing more.  Or let him release his own rock album.  Or made a rock sub-unit with Yongguk.  Mmmm..."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,immyongsoo,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:04:04 2015 UTC,BangHim- Sexy Clap. It gives me life
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,menbung,2,Sat Apr 4 19:24:21 2015 UTC,"Aww Tao ㅠㅠ But I most definitely respect your answers. Every member can't please every person, whatever the reason(s) may be. Although, I do agree with other people saying that Sehun seems to be lacking the most in comparison. Please don't hurt me, Sehun fans. Then again, both Tao and Sehun (especially Sehun) aren't given many chances to show their skills. And, IMO, Tao benefited more from this comeback."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,jangshin,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree on Suga. Originally, I thought he might just be kinda shy, but the more I watched them together on shows and stuff he kinda came off as being a bit of a downer. I've seen fans of his saying he's very sweet so I'm definitely open to being proven wrong but as it stands, he's my least favorite as well."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,ilaeriu,6,Sat Apr 4 15:00:15 2015 UTC,"I'm incredibly Suga-biased, but I see what you mean. He is indeed very sweet and does a good amount of fanservice during signings and stuff, but I think the other members overshadow him in terms of variety-esque things on-camera. Plus, it just may not be his kind of thing to be hyperactive all of the time. Although, I believe he's been a little more outgoing in some of their videos (that Bangtan Bomb with their ""rhythmic farce"" still makes me laugh uncontrollably)."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,daedgoco,3,Sat Apr 4 18:34:00 2015 UTC,"SHINee - Onew It's hard for me to pick someone in shinee, because I do love them all but honestly I have a hard time watching onew in variety. I know a lot of fans love his sangtae personality and corny puns but sometimes he makes me cringe and I have a low tolerance for awkwardness. I still love him doe. That voice... @_@  Vixx - Leo Leo is deeply beloved by a lot of people for his shy personality and I wouldn't say I dislike him, but he just doesn't appeal to me like the rest of the members do. I like him in the group because he's a great vocalist but when he does stuff like go crazy violent during variety show games it really turns me off him.   Super Junior - Kangin He was gone to the army when I started getting into suju and now I've never been able to muster up any interest in him. Plus he's strangely needy on twitter lol. I did like him in mamacita though, that watermelon scene was gold.  EXO - Kris Now I don't want to piss anyone off here but I've got some pent up feelings for this one, don't read if you're a sensitive flower who likes exo ;). I have never understood why people liked kris or felt he was attractive and I thought his bigass manga hands were creepy. He was a terrible rapper and embarrassing as hell and I was happy when he left the group.  2pm - Nichkhun Now I don't actually dislike him at all and he's a fine singer but I don't understand how he's supposed to be crazy attractive??? To me it's like they put the head of a 12 year old on top of a man's body... I guess Koreans like that pea-sized head thing but it is nagl to me. I'll gladly take taecyeon or junho over him any day.  Beast - Hyunseung I actually like him a lot but WHAT have they been doing with his STYLING lately??? It's like some crack addict wandered up onto the stage and they said, ""eh... ok. He can sing pretty good so just leave him...""  Somehow I can't think of any for girl groups... maybe dara from 2NE1 but she was great in that web drama she did with the guy from walking dead and she looked fabulous in Missing You, holy shit. Her singing also doesn't really bother me."
kpopslumberparty,31efgq,FeiVolution,6,Sat Apr 4 17:11:58 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, kris made me feel so much secondhand embarrassment. He was always trying to be cool and couldn't just act silly like the rest of them. It was really awkward. He looks like an alpaca to me too so I don't get how he was a visual but mostly the reaso I didn't like him was because he made me cringe so much. When people said he was cool I was like WAT."
