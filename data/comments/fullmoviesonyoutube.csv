I think Congo is an extreme, unethical sado-masochist who not only enjoyed killing people for real but enjoyed imagining their suffering. My theory is that the filmmaker realized this after a while, decided to stop, finish the doc, and promote it as if he was manipulating Congo and not the other way around. This is my own speculation. I don't know for sure, but I think that's why it's a bit disjointed. But in the end, it's one bizarre documentary with some fascinatingly twisted subjects."

Anwar Congo has done everything from express remorse over the movie, to claim he was tricked and is going to sue the director, to claiming he is very satisfied with the results.

This wonderfully witty coming-of-age film follows William as he falls face first to confront life, love, and lingo. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   Almost Famous was very well received by critics who gave it predominantly positive reviews. The film has an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 90 metascore on Metacritic. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and praised it for being ""funny and touching in so many different ways"". In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott wrote, ""The movie's real pleasures are to be found not in its story but in its profusion of funny, offbeat scenes. It's the kind of picture that invites you to go back and savor your favorite moments like choice album cuts"". Time magazine's Richard Corliss praised the film's screenplay for ""giving each character his reasons, making everyone in the emotional debate charming and compelling, creating fictional people who breathe in a story with an organic life"". In her review for the L.A. Weekly, Manohla Dargis wrote that ""the film shimmers with the irresistible pleasures that define Hollywood at its best - it's polished like glass, funny, knowing and bright, and filled with characters whose lives are invariably sexier and more purposeful than our own"". Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers wrote, ""Not since A Hard Day's Night has a movie caught the thrumming exuberance of going where the music takes you"". In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, ""Character-driven, it relies on chemistry, camaraderie, a sharp eye for detail and good casting"". Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, ""best-of"" list, saying, "" Every Cameron Crowe film is, in one way or another, about romance, rock & roll, and his romance with rock & roll. This power ballad of a movie, from 2000, also happens to be Crowe's greatest (and most personal) film thanks to the golden gods of Stillwater and their biggest fan, Kate Hudson's incomparable Penny Lane.""

The Cossack rebellion also known as the Khmelnytsky Uprising is pitting the Cossack nation and its Crimean Tatar allies against the forces sent by the Polish king John II Casimir. Polish Colonel Michal Wolodyjowski is leading a squadron of Polish cavalry.Traitors,assassins and spies are everywhere. Against the backdrop of the uprising, a Polish knight Skrzetuski and a Cossack leader Bohun fall in love with the same young beautiful woman, Helena. Their rivalry becomes the symbol of Polish-Ukrainian struggle. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   The original book is often deemed to be nationalistic and Ukrainophobic, especially in Ukraine. The movie on the other hand has been praised for its depiction of Ukraine and Ukrainians as ""vivid rather than monochromatic; they are multi-dimensional, eliciting more than one feeling of, say, fascination or dislike"". However, some Polish reviewers felt that the movie emphasized Cossacks' successes and positive traits while diminishing those of the Poles, in the spirit of political correctness.

A Common Sense Media review says, ""The pleasing visuals and fast-moving, double-trouble plots make Dog Days of the West one of the best in the Wishbone series. The value of friendship is emphasized in this episode; the show exposes children to O. Henry's short stories and infuses the traditional western with an updated perspective. As unlikely as it seems, Wishbone's wild west fable blends nicely with the contemporary story of a TV reporter running roughshod over one of Oakdale's finest citizens.

Personally message me if you want my project download links, but nothing of the sort can be posted inside this thread.]  THIS IS A NON-PROFIT FAN-BASED SOUNDTRACK/SCORE EDIT (parody-remix) DRAGON BALL and DRAGON BALL Z are all owned by FUNimation, Toei Animation, Fuji TV and Akira Toriyama. Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods is distributed by Toei Company, Ltd. and 20th Century Fox. Please support the official release.  The music used for this project was created by BRUCE FAULCONER & FAULCONER PRODUCTIONS: JULIUS DOBOS, BUDD GUIN, BEN KASPAREK, SCOTT MORGAN & MIKE SMITH. The music was featured in the original FUNimation dub of Dragon Ball Z. Special thanks to:   Yuriko Mori, Takeshi Ike, Kōhei Tanaka & Hiroki Takahashi for ""Makafushigi Adventure!"" Shuki Levy & Kussa Mahehi(Haim Saban) for ""Main Title"" & ""End Title"" (""Rock the Dragon"") Yukinojō Mori, Chiho Kiyo’oka, Kenji Yamamoto & Hironobu Kageyama for ""CHA-LA HEAD-CHA-LA"" - Live performace by Hironobu Kageyama & Masaaki Endoh   Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods – CZ Edition is a soundtrack/score edit project I decided to do after watching a few clips on YouTube of people adding in music from the Faulconer Productions (Bruce Faulconer, Julius Dobos, Budd Guin, Ben Kasparek, Scott Morgan & Mike Smith) soundtrack/score of FUNimation’s Dragon Ball Z dub to the first DBZ movie in ages, Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods. The music many of us grew up with in the late 90’s and early 00’s. I thought, “It’d be really cool if someone did this in the highest quality…and right…for the entire movie. That would be so freaking cool, especially for us fans that grew up with that dub.” So, I did. And then some.  Before I say anything else, I want to make it clear: I am a fan of both scores, both dubs, Japanese and English, the show’s original Japanese score, the show’s FUNimation produced score, the movie’s original score, everything. This is NOT meant to start another war in the comments about which score or soundtrack is better. I did this as a fun project because there’s always demand (nostalgia-driven, yes) from a lot of people who grew up with this music while experiencing the series for the first time on Cartoon Network’s Toonami block or the subsequent DVD releases. I didn’t do this in spite of the original score or in disregard for it; I did it so that all of us that grew up with this style of Dragon Ball Z can re-experience it again through this movie with another version of BoG. A re-scored version that caters to American (and even global) fans of Dragon Ball Z that started watching it when Cartoon Network’s Toonami block was first airing FUNimation’s original dub of the series, when the Dragon Ball Z and anime phenomenon spread in America.  There are fun bits I added for the all-around Dragon Ball fan, this isn’t just a Faulconer Productions edition…it “is”, but it’s slightly more than that. If you’re even more ”classic old-school dub” you’ll be pleased to see that I added the true original dub’s, the Ocean Dub’s, theme song: ""Main Title"" & ""End Title""…better known as ""Rock the Dragon"" into this edit (because nothing screams DBZ nostalgia for me, and probably you, like hearing “Rock the Dragon”). I also paid homage to the original Japanese score with ""Makafushigi Adventure!"" in a bright and funny way throughout the movie. And once again if you love the original Japanese score -and honestly if you’re a Dragon Ball fan in general-, you’re going to love the credits, I had fun with what I inserted in there (it syncs up perfectly with the end).  So please, sit down and watch, enjoy and share. I’ve put many hours and nights into this, play it loud! If you have headphones and like to watch with those, please do and blast it! If the response for this goes well and there’s demand I might consider making a ‘CZ Edition’ (aka Faulconer Productions soundtrack/score edit) for Resurrection ‘F’ and eventually even the new series Dragon Ball Super. Speaking of, HOW CRAZY IS IT THAT WE’RE GETTING NEW MOVIES AND A NEW SERIES OF DRAGON BALL IN 2015 GUYS?! It’s pretty crazy.  Now for some trivia and cool information:   If there’s any FUNi popo’s (Mr. Popo’s) reading this, yes I do own and have purchased the movie. This personal project I created is from content I purchased. For everyone else, if you haven’t done so already, please support the official release and buy it after seeing this non-profit fan-based soundtrack/score edit of Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods known as Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods – CZ Edition. More sales=more new Dragon Ball Z content. Once again, in the legendary words of Team Four Star, please support the official release. All the soundtrack/score replacement music (Faulconer Productions tracks and “Rock the Dragon”), barring one which I’ll mention next, is of the highest quality and taken from the CDs. The highest audio quality possible: FLAC. Editing software, like the one I used (Premiere Pro) doesn’t accept some file types like .flac files, so I had to convert them all to WAV: the next best thing and preferred standard for large high quality audio files. Practically indistinguishable to the human ear when compared to FLAC. So, these are the highest possible versions to have of these songs, couldn’t do it any other way. It had to be perfect and of the highest quality possible. The one song and part of the score that I couldn’t obtain and go from FLAC to WAV was “Great Saiyaman’s Theme” and its variations. Unfortunately, it was never released to us and doesn’t exist on any CD. The only thing I could do is scour the internet and YouTube for the best rip and edit of it a fan somewhere was able to do, and after searching for a while, I found the best one. The highest quality possible I could find and in the end it blends in with the rest of the movie and you could never tell it was the oddball out...unless I told you just now. Another bit that I had to do what I just mentioned above for was the beginning of the track “Vegeta - Super Saiyan” when Vegeta has his big iconic ”mmMYY BULMAAAaa” moment after Beerus pimp slaps Bulma. The opening piano bit of the song isn’t in the official version of the song for whatever reason…so I had to scour the internet again for the highest quality rip of that song, insert that small section into the sequence, cut and slice off where my high quality FLAC>WAV file of the song starts at, and then merge the two into a perfect transition. Speaking of that scene, this whole project is from the inspiration of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdEbG49_Zkc - This video was precisely my inspiration. I incorporated this idea into the movie, with some changes like the song that leads into it; it's literally perfect and shouldn't be changed for something like this. Kudos to the person that created that. So because of this and a couple other videos I saw is why I made this. Like I said earlier: I thought, “It’d be really cool if someone did this in the highest quality…and right…for the entire movie. That would be so freaking cool, especially for us fans that grew up with that dub.” Yep, 10 year old me would be ecstatic right now. The only scene in the movie that has a music piece and ISN’T replaced is the entrance and small cuts to Bulma’s birthday party where that guitar-y harmonica-y feel good song plays. It’s the only piece that was too loud on both audio tracks (which I’ll describe below) and impossible to get rid of without also getting rid of the background chatter, conversations and noises of the party, which I thought was necessary...and they are. I would have to mute the whole scene which would be…terrible. So that’s the only song that isn’t removed, but it isn’t really part of the score right…? It’s just the birthday band she hired playing the music, it doesn’t count! At least in my head that makes sense. Ha. While ALL the scenes that had a part of the score playing in this movie are replaced, except for the one I mentioned above, I also inserted songs into silent parts of the movie. Not all, no way, but some. There were quite a lot of silent parts in this movie, a whole lot. I took full advantage of that opportunity in the way that made the most sense, without overdoing it. My use of the original Dragon Ball theme song, ""Makafushigi Adventure!”, is taken straight from “Dragon Ball: Advanced Adventure” for the Game Boy Advance. Nothing screams and entices more old-school feels than the Dragon Ball song...in 8-bit form. Lol. Another fun fact, I ripped this song back when I was a kid from the game, as a high quality .wav file. I’ve had it all these years and it’s fitting that I made use of it for this, (probably) my first audio rip being used all these years later, most likely over a decade later. Characters like Beerus weren’t around when Faulconer Productions made their music…so what can I do about that? I had to find a character theme that fit for whenever Beerus got absolutely raged or entered his whole death bomb doomsday bit…and nothing was more fitting for Beerus the God of Destruction than the song titled…”Destruction.” “Pan’s Song” was used for Goku’s kid-like proposition to Beerus and for Videl’s announcement of, well, Pan. I used it for Goku because it fit the mood (it was the only song I could find that had some innocence and fit the context) and because that’s the lightheartedness Goku has that in turn he gave to Pan, he is her grandfather after all. So it seemed fitting the song would play for both Goku the new grandfather acting like a polite child and Videl’s announcement of Pan the new granddaughter. It also synced up perfectly with practically no editing or trimming needed from start to finish, that piano roll before he transforms rolls by perfectly."
fullmoviesonyoutube,3djhjs,supamesican,5,Thu Jul 16 19:44:20 2015 UTC,"I decided to go for the regular and original “SSJ Transformation” theme song as the Super Saiyan God theme. Nothing else seemed fitting and nothing else made sense. It’s also great because as this new variation of the Super Saiyan form is introduced, it’s almost as if we’re taking it back to the start once more. “SSJ Transformation” is more of the Super Saiyan national anthem to me and stands for the idea of transforming into a Super Saiyan, regardless of the variation. So it was fitting that the song that first played when Goku first turned Super Saiyan years ago is the song being played when Goku turns Super Saiyan God years later. At some point I run out of material to use. There's only a certain number of tracks that fit certain themes and don't go all over the place, and then you're left with no choice but to break out of the mold...a little bit, unfortunately. Remember there's not an infinite number of albums Faulconer Productions released...so while I don't do stupid things like placing Super Buu's Theme when Beerus is fighting, expect there to be something else in place there, as there was no Beerus back then. There are just some themes that scream iconic and resonate to you, one of those is Super Buu's Theme. You cannot listen to that and not think of Super Buu, lol. That's why it's bittersweet that you can't use these iconic songs for anything but those characters, it sucks but at the same time it just makes sense. Believe me; the songs that fit certain moods when people aren't fighting are few and hiding in the albums. There's a lot to choose from but hardly what you're looking for to fit the new visual material, especially as you're trying to not use iconic characters' themes. I simply can't put a Majin Buu song (with his famous jingling melody) during something that doesn't involve Majin Buu. It's...not right and doesn't make sense, especially to DBZ fans and our ears. It's a tough job to do, that's for sure. I found myself searching through all the songs so, so much for things that fit the mood and make sense without stepping on the boundary of popular characters' themes. Believe it or not, it was hard to find songs for certain scenes; the moods I needed to accompany had a scarce number of songs available that made sense in a new context. Addressing that right away…let’s talk about the use of “A Little Help from a Friend” when Goku arrives on Earth. Popularly known to fans as “Piccolo’s Theme” and while Piccolo is the first one to say something as Goku arrives, which coincidentally is pretty cool, that’s all he has to do with this song being used in this movie. I was going more for the title of the song being the focal point and the perspective rather than the character association with Piccolo. Like I just mentioned above, there was nothing else that could fill that moment of desperation and relief when there’s “a friend arriving to help”, I found nothing. As was the case with “Pan’s Song” during Goku’s childish offer, nothing else fit the bill for the arrival of Goku to help than this iconic Dragon Ball Z song. Scratch that, as I was typing this (typing this on the 8th) I reconsidered. Breaking news live fun fact edition indeed, I just found the perfect replacement, “Goku Recovers.” Gonna encode another version for like the 20th time. Your song is still yours, Piccolo. If you haven’t noticed yet or haven’t watched yet, this is the extended uncut edition. So if this is your first time seeing the entire extended movie have fun, and afterwards, once again: please support the official release and buy it. “How’d you do it?” Very, very, very long process. I ripped streams from my Battle of Gods Blu-ray, video and audio. This is extremely important because of the Blu-ray’s feature of having 5.1 surround sound audio. With that comes more than one audio track. There’s the main audio track, an audio track with isolated vocals, a Japanese vocals track, and so on. Ideally, those first 2 tracks I mentioned should be played at the same time if you’re listening to the FUNimation dub. The score is on the main track and is also heard very quietly on the isolated vocals track. Long story short, when the real main score would kick in I had to mute it and raise the volume of the quieter isolated vocals track (at the exact moment, same frame, barring some exceptions due to a sound situation) and add the replacement, until the main score ended and then I turned the main one back on while lowering the isolated vocals track back down. Constantly, over and over. Then there are random background sounds that would ruin the scene if you turned one back on too soon due to Foley noise discrepancies with the volume shifts of the tracks. So I’d have to slightly extend a song track a little bit more to cover that sometimes, gradually raise the other audio track sometimes, or both. Some tracks are too long, some too short, they have to end just right at the right frame, or fade out just right at the right frame. Yep, frames, frames and more frames. I went through so many frames. Constant volume changes with frames matching up, key frames (so many keyframes, I added so many keyframes), an editor’s nightmare- but I still had fun lol. There’s so much more to explain that I had to do…but this is as much as I’ll explain at the moment. You can imagine. Fellow editors understand.   Here are some pictures of some sections of the movie in Premiere Pro and then the final picture is of the entire thing zoomed out. Yup. In the words of Goten: “…so awesome…”   “Some added songs are a little louder than the rest…a tad bit louder…why?” Those few scenes had the original score playing in the background louder than usual and were harder to mask. It’s what we have to deal with when there’s no true isolated vocals track and only one that plays the score quieter. Most of the time in those few scenes the tracks blend in and you barely notice them unless you really crank up the volume and listen for it. This was my first time using Premiere Pro. “CZ…? What’s that?” My initials and sometimes nickname. And it’s pretty cool that the Dragon Ball “Z” can be put into my name for the title logo, so that was a big plus. ”Will you do this for the new movie? For the new series?” If this gets popular and the demand is there…yes. The only thing that I need, as you all now know, is for the Blu-ray to be available and have 5.1 surround sound and multiple audio tracks(which they all do, I think). This will make Resurrection ‘F’ very likely to receive a “CZ Edition” once that hits stores but for Dragon Ball Super…we’ll have to wait until the dub is released here…on Blu-ray. No other way around it.   If anyone has any other questions outside of what you just read feel free to ask and I’ll try to get to them. I hope you all enjoy it. And afterwards, like I said, please support the official release."

For one, this music you're listening to in my edit is not in Kai, they changed young Gohan's voice actress which angered me, and there is still some filler in it and the whole production has been a mess despite it being hailed as the no filler supreme edition recently. I'd say to stick with the original DBZ, when you get to that point. If you want to experience the FULL show in its entirety, like you should at least once ;)"

He noted that it was focused on lighthearted moments, but that the ""comedic moments were not only funny but also true to the series, and the fight scenes were excellent one and all."" He particularly praised the animation as the best of the series, due to technological advancements since the early 1990s, and declared that the highlight of the movie was how in the end the villain was undoubtedly the winner over Goku in a ""complete reversal of the standard DBZ formula"". Otaku USA's Matt Schley agreed that it is a comedy heavy film ""more reminiscent of the original Dragon Ball than Z"". He speculates that the viewer's enjoyment of the movie depends on what they expect; ""If you want epic Dragon Ball Z story worthy of the title Battle of Gods, this film may disappoint. But if you’re just happy to see your favorite characters performing a few animated hijinx again after all these years, this film certainly delivers.""

She has been going on about imaginary places and people so much that Aunt Em takes her to see a doctor. She promptly escapes from the mental hospital and wakes up in Oz where her pet chicken, Billina, can now talk.

Canadian film critic Jay Scott felt the protagonists were too creepy for viewers to sympathize with: ""Dorothy's friends are as weird as her enemies, which is faithful to the original Oz books but turns out not to be a virtue on film, where the eerie has a tendency to remain eerie no matter how often we're told it's not."" ""It's bleak, creepy, and occasionally terrifying,"" added Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader. The film earned $2,844,895 in its opening weekend, finishing in seventh place.

Todd Gilchrist of IGN applauded the performances of Bale and Jackman whilst praising Nolan for making ""this complex story as easily understandable and effective as he made the outwardly straightforward comic book adaptation (Batman Begins) dense and sophisticated... any truly great performance is almost as much showmanship as it is actual talent, and Nolan possesses both in spades."" CNN.com and Village Voice film critic Tom Charity listed it amongst his best films of 2006. Philip French of The Observer recommended the film, comparing the rivalry between the two main characters to that of Mozart and Salieri in the highly acclaimed Amadeus.

This film would have been so much better if it had just offered a plausible explanation. You can't spend a film establishing era, establishing a serious tone, no indication of science fiction, and suddenly throw that in at the very ending. The ""twins"" idea was also implausible, but at least it was confined to reality. I could look the other way for that, but a fucking cloning machine... no. That's just insulting. That's the film saying ""fuck you, this film has to end on a twist, so anything goes now and you're gonna just have to accept it.

It was more along the lines of ""Tesla was a crazy scientist, how do we leverage this in a film?""  I feel that part of the movie's inspiration was taken from Van Helsing, another movie that had Hugh Jackman in it and a ""crazy scientist"" (Dr. Frankenstein and his resulting monster) roughly 2 years before The Prestige came out. Both movies revolved around a science experiment that had to go just right in order to work, had a lot of relation to electricity (electricity was the foundation for human tech advancement after all), and all the other stuff that's basically identical.. The science fiction elements were present from the beginning of both movies.  I find it to be brilliant enough. You're just looking at it from the wrong angle I think."

These thieves are led by arch-criminal Neal MacAuley. One of their operations, an armored-car robbery, goes bad and the armored-car guards are murdered by the gunmen - putting LAPD homicide detective Vince Hanna on the trail of the thieves. Hanna knows it will take a lot to bring these dangerous, armed thieves down, and it will end in a horrifying gun battle when the thieves try to rob a major federal bank... (IMDb)   Critical reception:   Heat was well received by critics. The film-critic aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 86% positive reviews based on 76 reviews, summarizing the film as ""an engrossing crime drama that draws compelling performances from its stars – and confirms Michael Mann's mastery of the genre."" Metacritic gives the film a score of 76 based on 22 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film 3½ stars out of 4, writing: ""It's not just an action picture. Above all, the dialogue is complex enough to allow the characters to say what they're thinking: They are eloquent, insightful, fanciful, poetic when necessary. They're not trapped with cliches. Of the many imprisonments possible in our world, one of the worst must be to be inarticulate — to be unable to tell another person what you really feel."" Simon Cote of The Austin Chronicle called the film ""[o]ne of the most intelligent crime-thrillers to come along in years"", and said Pacino and De Niro's scenes together were ""poignant and gripping"".

(IMDb)   Critical reception:   Much critical attention has been paid to the film's focus on sexuality and gender identity. Sharalyn Orbaugh has noted that the opening scene of Ghost in the Shell begins with the ""perfect paradoxical introduction to a narrative that is all about the nature of sex/gender identity and self-identity in general in a future world where sexual reproduction has given way to mechanical replication."" Motoko's female identity and appearance are countered by an autonomous subjectivity, resulting in a ""male"" cyborg body which cannot menstruate. Orbaugh describes the juxtaposition of the opening scene depicting the creation of Motoko's body and to her lack of menstruation as setting the theme of ""reproductive sexuality in a posthuman subject."" The film depicts Motoko's identity and ontological concerns, ending with the evolution of a being with full subjectivity, through a new form of reproduction with the Puppet Master. Austin Corbett commented on the lack of sexualization from her team as freedom from femininity, noting that Motoko is ""overtly feminine, and clearly non-female."" Carl Slivio has called Ghost in the Shell a ""resistant film"", due to its inversion of traditional gender roles, its ""valorization of the post-gendered subject"", and its de-emphasis of the sexual specificity of the material body.

Owen heads for Florida, ostensibly to do a piece on her, but in reality to try to put his own demons to rest. Wounds from the event are ruining Sherry and Owen's current relationships. Is there any prospect of healing? A judge, Sherry's manager, and a widow with young kids provide supporting arms.

They are in the Hermitage museum in St. Petersburg and together walk through the various rooms, entering a different era on each occasion. The man in black interacts with the people he meets there and offers a commentary on the works of art. The film is notable for having been filmed in one continuous shot. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   Russian Ark received high critical acclaim. Roger Ebert wrote, ""Apart from anything else, this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen.... [T]he effect of the unbroken flow of images (experimented with in the past by directors like Hitchcock and Max Ophüls) is uncanny. If cinema is sometimes dreamlike, then every edit is an awakening. Russian Ark spins a daydream made of centuries."" (Wikipedia)   Awards: 4 wins and 11 nominations  More info at IMDb, Wikipedia, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, Netflix, Freebase. I am a bot.

fullmoviesonyoutube,3cpy01,Zukamimotu,5,Fri Jul 10 07:51:49 2015 UTC,"There are gonna be some massive spoilers for some great Batman media here, so tread lightly.  While it's true that you never really know with the Joker, there are several facts within the accounts of his origin, as told by him in ""The Killing Joke (1988)"" that can be confirmed by other characters. The biggest portion of the story that we can confirm is that the Joker says he was forced to don a red hood and also forced to enter the chemical plant he used to work at. We also know that the Joker lept into a vat of chemicals to escape Batman, fearing that he would be accused of being the mastermind.   There are a couple of ways we can confirm this, but the biggest piece of evidence is that Batman WAS there at the chemical plant that night. The Joker in the comics (and most media, barring Nolan-verse which is not the same canon as what would typically be considered Batman canon) does not use makeup, as it's revealed that his white skin, ruby lips, and green hair are a result of the chemical bath he took trying to get away from Bats.  The next portion of facts comes from what happens after the chemical bath and ensuing escape from Batman; the Joker realizes how disfigured he is, and, coupled with the previous events of the day (he had been informed by police that his pregnant wife had been killed earlier that day), and is driven insane. This leads him to his mantra which is repeated throughout The Killing Joke, ""All it takes for a man to be driven insane is one bad day."" This is where it all gets a little shaky, as the Joker says in the same comic, in regards to his backstory ""I'd prefer it to be multiple choice.""  Back to the ""one bad day"" bit from earlier, though, the Joker kidnaps Barbara Gordon, paralyzes her (this is another verifiable fact I will discuss later), strips her of her clothes, and forces Commissioner Gordon to view pictures of his daughter in that position in an attempt to drive the man insane. We know that it's possible the Joker could have picked this up somewhere, but there's no reason to assume the Joker is lying when the facts add up.  This brings me to Barbara Gordon's paralysis. You may or may not remember Batman Beyond? It was a Batman cartoon with 52 episodes that ran from January 1999 - December 2001. It was, of course, syndicated on Cartoon Network for a while before finally being pulled off the air to make room for other DC Universe shows. Anyway, in Batman Beyond, Tim Drake is Batman. Tim Drake is assisted by none other than a paralyzed Barbara Gordon. This proves two things. Since the comic books are all generally considered canon up until the New 52, it proves that Batman Beyond is canon with the comics. It also proves that other Batman animations which precede Batman Beyond in the timeline are also canon. But I know what you're saying, ""Hey, what does this all have to do with the Joker's origin story?""  You may be surprised to know that one of the many animated features actually discusses the Red Hood. This is another point where things start to get kind of shaky, though, and I will explain. In Batman: Under The Red Hood (great movie, definitely recommend), the Joker kills Jason Todd, the Robin at the time. A little while later, a mysterious villain calling himself the Red Hood shows up and starts causing trouble. The Joker himself even comments on this, saying ""When I wore that number, it was classy.  More 'flashy maitre d' than 'motorcycle fetish.'"" The Joker here confirms for us that he was the Red Hood at first, lending even more credibility to his story.  And yes, I know timelines in the DC Universe can be kinda fucky when it comes to what's canon. In one timeline, Jason Todd dies forever and never comes back. In another timeline, he comes back to life to be the Red Hood. In another timeline, he lives completely.   All things considered, though, I think that the biggest issue with the origin story presented in The Killing Joke would be small details . I've just spent the last half hour of my time writing up why we can put a lot of trust into his important details. The Joker lies, changes parts of a story, but above all, he likes to tease Batman with what he thinks is the ""truth"" of the world. Sure, he could easily lie simply to enrage Batman in order to try to get ol' Bats to kill him quickly, but why set such short term goals? Short term isn't really how the Joker rolls.  TL;DR The Joker has said some pretty unreliable shit before, but based on what we know about the Joker, his origin as presented in The Killing Joke is probably correct."

You're probably thinking ""hey big whoop, suck a penis"" but that's because you haven't seen this film and you don't know what a pivotal year that was; not only for the city of New York, but also as one that would define Americana in ways that we still feel today.    Some of the topics in the film include: • The Gay rights movement which was just ramping up • Hip Hop lifestyle from music, to breaking, to activism, to graffiti • The NY blackout which resulted in mass looting but which helped to facilitate the rise of Hip Hop • The Studio 54 club scene and the Disco craze  • The shift in politics with a new mayoral race • The Son of Sam killings • CBGB's and the rise of Punk and New Wave music in NYC • The Drugs, crime and seedy New York atmosphere that facilitated it all     The documentary covers the wide range of topics efficiently and manages to keep from getting jumbled up, confusing or boring.  There are great interviews from political candidates, New York socialites, members of the gay community, famous musicians, and a whole plethora of fascinating New Yorkers.  The editing is tight, the music is great, the structure is magnificent and the subject matter is presented in a refreshing, engaging and educational way.    TL;DR - 10/10 I don't like to give out 10 ratings, and reserve it only for films that I consider to have not only done everything right, but that also manage to be the type of thing that sticks with you after you've seen it.

Now I know what you're thinking, it's either: ""wow Nick Cage and Mike Bay?  This has to be the worst movie ever"" or ""Nick Cage is the fucking man, the one true God will not be merciful on your deathbed"".  Well, for the first point, somehow defying every possible odd in the stats book this film is not only tolerable, but actually pretty good.  And for the second point, I fucking love Nick Cage, Lord of War is one of my favorite films, but even I can admit that the guy has made a lot of objectively shitty movies.    Moving right along then.  The film also stars Ed Harris and Sean Connery.  Harris plays a General in the military who gets pissed off because his men were sent on black ops missions, a bunch of them died, and their families never ended up getting any compensation.  So he decides to go to steal a bunch of missiles, take over Alcatraz and hold a bunch of tourists hostage and demands 100 million dollars so that their families can preserve the honor of the dead by being hella rich.    The FBI decides ""fuck that"" and sends Nick Cage to save the day.  Cage plays a loser nerd who never leaves his nerd kingdom to expose his skin to the gently soothing sun, yet still manages to: expertly drive a Ferrari in a high-speed pursuit through a city, break into Alcatraz through a physically taxing maze, take on a whole platoon of trained and experienced US Marines who have a home court advantage, all with only the help of a 60 year old man who's been in prison for the last 30 years.    The movie features all the standard bayhem like car chases, gunfights, ridiculous action, unnecessary action, a plot that doesn't make much sense if you think about it too long, and of course, explosions.  The saving graces of this film are that this was early in Bay's career when he still gave a shit about something besides money, Nick Cage was still riding high as one of Hollywood's biggest actors, the invisible hand of action producer extraordinaire Jerry Bruckheimer, and an uncredited script appearance by none other than Quentin Tarantino.  The film was actually acclaimed to the extent that it even managed to get a Criterion Release, so I mean... I really wasn't lying when I said this film defied the odds.    TL;DR - 7/10 It's a pretty damn good action movie.  The acting is solid, the story is well written, and the pace is exciting and keeps your attention.  So why doesn't this film get a better rating?  Well, at the end of the day, it's still pretty dumb.  It's a total popcorn flick, which doesn't even try to be smart, to the extent that Ed Harris, the main antagonist, really isn't really that bad of a guy and you end up kind of rooting for him.  It's also pretty forgettable, there's not a lot of memorable scenes, and once the explosions and smoke clears, you find yourself not really remembering much about the movie.  The tl;dr of this tl;dr is that The Rock is really just a pretty entertaining amusement park ride, but that unfortunately isn't enough to make it a great film in my book."

At the time it was somewhat exploitative, but back then most people had little exposure to homosexuals.  It was entirely possible for some yokel to view it and believe that it was reflective of all gays.  Today we can see it dealt with a subset of the population."
fullmoviesonyoutube,3cotnf,sanantoniobay,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:21:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I grew up in NYC in the seventies, and it was a pretty big part of the culture then and there.  The Ramrod and other venues always had a crowd of leatherboys out front and it seemed liked an underworld worthy of exploration on film. This film, particularly, went into the secret codes and practices, most of which the straight world had no idea of at all."
fullmoviesonyoutube,3cotnf,YFC,0,Fri Jul 10 15:03:19 2015 UTC,Why did this particular film and posting have to have a mini synopsis highlighting sexual orientation included in the title?
fullmoviesonyoutube,3cotnf,sanantoniobay,-1,Fri Jul 10 01:10:14 2015 UTC,"Because it was a very distinct subculture in the time and place of the film, and one that is very foreign to most people born after its release. If the movie involved an undercover cop infiltrating the Irish mob in 1920s Chicago it'd be important to list that to distinguish the setting from the Italian Mafia operating at the same time, for instance."

Everything about our world is completely and totally soaked in sexuality, heterosexuality in particular.  Even this sub notes when a movie is ""erotic"" all the time.

Marine Corps hymn starts with""From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli"", and this film's story purports to be the reason why, and is give or take a few incidents in this movie: It is 1805 and the Tripoli pirates have challenged America's right to freedom of the seas---all of them, anywhere---so United Stares warships were sent to that port to bottle up their fleet and set the riff-raff right concerning who could sail where. (History begins to suffer a bit along about this point.) A U. S. Marine unit, headed by Lieutenant O'Bannon, was sent to attack them from the rear. He organized his unit around Hamet, Pasha of Tripoli, in exile after being overthrown by his brother. In Hamet's court was Sheila D'Arneau, a diploma's daughter, who disguises herself as a dancing girl, and joins the group of eight U. S. Marines and Hamet supporters in their march across the Libyan desert. O'Bannon and Shelia argue all the way to Tripoli. (IMDb)   More info at IMDb, Netflix, Freebase. I am a bot. Send me feedback.

FROM IMDb      It's funny. Longtime fans know that there were four original ""making-of"" documentaries on the Original Trilogy. They were:    -The Making of Star Wars -SPFX: Empire Strikes Back -Classic Creatures: Return of the Jedi -From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga    These four never made it further than Laserdisc. They were ignored for the OT DVD release in 2004 and have never had a separate release on DVD like they could have.    The new Blu-ray set has been announced for September. Miraculously, the first three are included! Suspiciously, ""From Star Wars to Jedi"" is not. It's obvious why. In the interviews, Lucas admits that he didn't settle on Vader as Anakin until after Star Wars(ANH) was released! He had to decide between Vader as Anakin or Vader as Anakin's killer and admits he didn't do that until just before ESB began filming. Yet today, we're told that the ""saga"" was the ""Tragedy of Darth Vader"" all along. Right. Maybe the new fans buy that but the older fans know better. He also admits that Yoda wasn't created until scriptwriting for ESB. He mentions the fact that ROTJ was originally going to involve a planet of Wookiees, not the Ewoks. A much better idea. He explains why he changed it to the Ewoks. He even says that too often, special effects are on-screen for too long and cannot substitute for a good story.    All of these admissions would be nothing for most filmmakers. But for Lucas, this would debunk the falsehood he puts out to the kids today of the whole thing being a six-film pre-planned ""saga"" all along. He probably doesn't like the word ""saga"" in the title of this documentary for the OT either. Not to mention the use of the old Sebastian Shaw force ghost footage from ROTJ.    He doesn't want this one ever released again. How else can you explain the absence of this one, yet including the other three, while giving us nearly four hours of fans in stormtrooper costumes, spoofs, and the lame ""Star Wars Tech"". Where's ""Empire of Dreams"" too? What a shame."

Captain Labesch arrives from the mainland, determined to crack down on the island's lawlessness and clean up the ineffectual, hard-drinking police force. He appeals for assistance from wealthy plantation tycoon Carl Van Molder, who owns nearly half of the island and wields a great deal of influence over the population. Van Molder has made the study of parapsychology his life's work and believes in the secret powers of the mind. He warns Labesch not to interfere with this forgotten island's ancient ways. Also visiting is Van Molder's niece, Annabella, a temperance crusader who wants her uncle to help fund the International Anti-Saloon League. She falls in love with handsome police lieutenant Andrew Wilhelm, despite his fondness for rum. Meanwhile, beautiful native girls are being transformed into zombies, and a sinister snake dancer named Kalea leads them to attack and devour any meddling policemen who get too close to their unholy rituals. When Annabella is kidnapped and prepared to be the cult's latest human sacrifice, Labesch and Wilhelm have to infiltrate their ranks to save her, and they finally learn the secret identity of the all-powerful Damballah.

They were dismissed, by critics and Karloff fans alike, as undistinguished efforts. The film when released also appeared to be dated and inferior as, between its filming and release another zombie film, Night of the Living Dead (1968), had raised the standards for the genre. Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle said, ""Though sometimes strange to the point of psychedelic, this tame offering consists of interminable scenes of native rites, women trying to look seductively evil, and shorts of snakes.""

fullmoviesonyoutube,3c279a,MovieGuide,3,Sat Jul 4 02:02:40 2015 UTC,This movie is really nice. It portrays how we are not the only species and shows how a different species who understands ego wants to survive. It feels like anything wants to protect the dna that built up over aeons.  I like to think the opposite way...what if we were the prawns and they were the humans..?
fullmoviesonyoutube,3c279a,frostyoni,16,Sat Jul 4 09:00:49 2015 UTC,"The movie is about South African society. The blacks that live in the townships (slums) are the ""prawns"".  In the 1960s, the apartheid government declared a whole neighbourhood of Capetown (called district 6) ""whites only"" and forced the population out, bulldozing most buildings and sending the locals to the outskirts of the city, just like in the movie. So its all about racism and xenophobia."

(IMDb)   Critical reception:   Upon its U.S. release, Hocus Pocus received rather mixed to negative reviews from film critics. The Miami Herald called it ""a pretty lackluster affair"", adding this comment: ""Despite the triple-threat actress combo, Hocus Pocus won't be the Sister Act of 1993. There are a lot of gotta-sees this summer, and this isn't one of them."" The New York Times' Janet Maslin wrote that the film ""has flashes of visual stylishness but virtually no grip on its story"". Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C-, calling it ""acceptable scary-silly kid fodder that adults will find only mildly insulting. Unless they're Bette Midler fans. In which case it's depressing as hell""; and stating that while Najimy and Parker ""have their moments of ramshackle comic inspiration, and the passable special effects should keep younger campers transfixed [...] the sight of the Divine Miss M. mugging her way through a cheesy supernatural kiddie comedy is, to say the least, dispiriting."" On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Hocus Pocus has a ""Rotten"" score of 33%, based on twenty-four reviews; however, the audience score is a ""fresh"" 70%, with an average rating of 3.1 stars out of 5.
