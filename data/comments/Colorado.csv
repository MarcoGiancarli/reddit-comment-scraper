Colorado,3e4fuw,jeremt22344,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:45:10 2015 UTC,Exactly. CO's minimum jail time for reckless driving of 10 days really bumps us up the list... the fines are actually less than many states on the list.   What I found interesting from reading the study was that there are still more than a few states where racing on a highway isn't illegal. Wtf?

I'm still bitter about that."

Colorado,3e4fuw,pobody,2,Wed Jul 22 01:33:55 2015 UTC,"Work zones may have lower speed limits because of things smaller shoulders on the road, cones, no passing lanes, lane shifts, etc. Not just because of workers in the area."

Colorado,3e4fuw,armeggedonCounselor,6,Wed Jul 22 00:26:44 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure this isn't based on the frequency or range for getting pulled over for speeding, but rather the penalties that you incur for speeding. If you read the methodology linked in the article it turns out CO is tied for 10th place for speeding enforcement, and tied for second for reckless driving penalties. Averaging those two gets us the first place over all."

In Texas I got pulled over ONCE on an offramp before the only speed limit sign on that long offramp (that was 20MPH below highway speed) I was super nice to the cop and followed all the rules for when you get pulled over, my Texas license was completely clean and all my paperwork was in order.  Got the full fucking ticket for 15 over and had to pay several hundred dollars and take the stupid class.  Glad I lived in Texas for only a year.  I came back to Colorado as soon as I could."

In fact you can visit many of the improved and distributed campgrounds in state and national parks where firearms are not allowed.

Colorado,3dybjt,tarrasque,21,Tue Jul 21 01:59:39 2015 UTC,"That's a tough situation if they are shooting on Private land.  There isn't really any way for the Campground Owner to go out and force them to stop, but it might be worth his time to discuss it with them.  When it comes to BLM land; most Gun Owners (contrary to what some people seem to think) aren't bloodthirsty maniacs that are going to shoot you for asking them to stop or laugh and tell you to fuck off.  We have a vested interest in folks not complaining to the local ranger districts or their politicians.    I generally prefer to shoot at public ranges like the one near Buena Vista, but I will occasionally do some shooting on BLM land.   The one time I've had someone ask me if I could stop we worked out a reasonable compromise in that I'd keep shooting for another hour and then that was it.  I'd really only intended to keep going for about another two hours anyhow, so it was no big loss to me and I realize that other folks have as much right to enjoy the land as I do.     The main thing is not to be antagonistic.  It cuts both ways.  If I am out shooting and someone comes up and politely asks if I can stop/tone it down, I'll usually be reasonable.  If someone comes out and starts yelling/screaming at me I'm probably not going to be very open to doing anything more than what the law requires (distance from road, safe backstop, etc...)."

Colorado,3dybjt,RanthersReallyRuck,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:10 2015 UTC,"You know at first I read your reply and thought ""no way"" because we were just driving along randomly when I saw the strawberries on the side of the road.  But I scanned Google Maps and it actually wasn't that hard to find at all.  It's here: http://i.imgur.com/gFkrqDJ.jpg  Which is here: https://goo.gl/maps/yAQP2  So... what there is there.  First there is a lot of wild strawberries.  And by a lot, I mean they are everywhere.  We did pick quite a few but there were lots left.  Wild strawberries are super small, but pack a lot of taste.  You may ask ""are you sure that they really were strawberries?"" and they were.  First because we all ate about 50 each of them and we are fine, second because that's what they look like, and third that's what they tasted like.  For the spring, it was a hole in the ground that was dumping 2-3 gallons per minute, you could see the water coming down the ditch next to the road and I followed it back 10-15 feet into a small grove and it came out from there.    Now there is a small creek not even 50 feet away, so I'm guessing that this isn't a true artisan spring because it's likely coming from water from the creek... but it is a spring from in the sense that a lot of water is coming out of a hole in the ground.  My daughters thought it was really neat just to watch.  But if you follow the creek up, that actually does come out of a real artisan spring - but it's not quite as dramatic as the hole and it's a bit of a hike.  The creek is shown on the satellite image - it's the faint brown line cutting diagonal a bit off to the left of the arrow.  There is a great camping spot right next to the arrow.  In fact, you can pull off the road where the arrow is, pull the car off a bit and then hike 40 feet and it's a wonderful camping spot with a fire pit.    I believe it is within the rules of dispersed camping since the creek is ~100ft. to the west.  Dispersed camping rules: http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5352768.pdf"

Colorado,3dybjt,chrismetalrock,2,Mon Jul 20 22:43:16 2015 UTC,"Jacks Gulch is a great campground for kids and groups, so it's too bad people are getting run off. Typically the shooting happens just outside the campground on flowers road. But it's close enough to be loud."
Colorado,3dybjt,peasncarrots20,2,Mon Jul 20 18:54:12 2015 UTC,"Yes this, I found so much isolation finding dispersed camp sites by going 2-5hrs west from Denver. I did run into hunters a few times."

Colorado,3dybjt,ljp3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:14 2015 UTC,Guilty. But I go on public land. Usually find a forest service road and drive as far into the woods as I can. I make sure to shoot into the side of a hill and at least 150 yards from any campsite.

The campground owners told me that the law only states that a person needs to be just 100 feet away from anyone else, which by his own admission was not enough because a bullet can travel a mile."

Luckily our trip was nothing like this, but the whole time I was hearing gunshots at the campground we were at, I was imagining stories like yours happening, and no one being around to help. The fact that you had your baby with you and they didn't seem to care is the worst part. Someone else on that 14rs chat board said something that resonated with me, which was that people like these put responsible gun owners at risk.   Again, I'm all for the right to bear arms, but the only problem with the freedom we enjoy as Americans is the inbread dipshit idiots like these guys you encountered. That's what a lot of people don't understand...laws are made to safeguard us against idiots like these. If we put ANY restrictions on firearms, the gun enthusiasts start raising hell immediately that the socialist government is trying to take away their rights, instead of understanding that the laws are made to protect responsible, freedom-loving Americans against fucktards like these.  Glad you got out of that situation ok. I'm curious to know if they ever did get in trouble due to your reporting them."

Colorado,3dybjt,__PROMETHEUS__,3,Tue Jul 21 00:59:59 2015 UTC,"I had an issue a few days ago. The wife and I went up in the middle of the week to Jones pass in empire. It was fairly empty, just a few scattered camps. For some reason this group of five (two older males a wife and a kid) parks right next to my truck and starts to set up an impromptu gun range. We're trying to enjoy our coffee and see these guys pulling rifles out right next to us. Jones pass has miles of trail and these idiots are now shooting at the entrance to the area we were planning on hiking. No decency what so ever, not even a heads up. I'm starting to loose it and the lady mumbles something about it being public land. Whatever. I heard multiple ricochet's so we packed up and left before the kid shoots his eye out or something.  We go up to get away and stupid still finds us."
Colorado,3dybjt,freewaytrees,7,Tue Jul 21 09:19:17 2015 UTC,"You were in the middle of a freedom sandwich. We all have rights and express those rights, but sometimes it can be very annoying for others.  The best way to avoid this is to research where you want to camp ahead of time. Forums, Google Maps, and friends who have been to the area are your best resources.  I too support guns, yet have none of my own. There have been several times I was stuck next to shooters and couldn't do anything about it. But what I find comforting is how many people are expressing their right and learning how to use their guns in a safe area. Lately the news has been covering a few stories in CO about people shooting too close to each other, stray bullets hitting campers and shooters destroying camp sites. The solution is not to ban guns, but to better help non-shooters and shooters find different areas to camp. Over the 4th, several friends and myself camped in a valley below 5 14ers. There were plenty of other campers and shooting was not restricted. Common courtesy and respect for others ended up out weighing anyone's decision to use their fire arms. It was a calm and quite holiday camping trip. You just have to know where to look."
Colorado,3dybjt,__PROMETHEUS__,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:36:38 2015 UTC,"You got it right when you mention common courtsey and respect for others. When I want to shoot a gun (which I do, even though I, too do not own any of my own), I go to a shooting range (indoor) which is designated for shooting guns. I wish everyone was as thoughtful and unselfish as those folks you camped near/with on the 4th. I understand wanting to learn to shoot, but some people want to shoot just to shoot. Like I said, I'm all for the right to bear arms but damn!, how far away from society do I have to get to get some peace and quiet?!?!?!"

Colorado,3dybjt,TheThirdNormalForm,4,Tue Jul 21 02:15:38 2015 UTC,"There's a time and a place to shoot outside freely. Near CO Springs, we have a road you can drive back on for several miles and shoot into almost any hill. There are sometimes campers and hikers, but most people know this is one of the few open shooting areas so gun fire is common. Recently, two common shooting areas/roads have been restricted due to excess shooters absolutely ruining a beautiful area, not to mention a large fire (Waldo Canyon). I can now drive about 30 min to great camp grounds with amazing views and not worry about gunfire all day.  My big concerns now are for my family of three, so I drive further into the mounatains, 3+ hrs, to find pristine camp grounds with few hectic shooters and great fishing. Don't let your last camp trip leave a bad taste in your mouth. There's a lot of camping out there with an abundance of peace and quite.  I'm on mobile, so it's a pain to post links, but if you want recommended places to go or links to forums PM me and I'll help point you in the right direction."
Colorado,3dybjt,eazolan,-6,Mon Jul 20 16:02:27 2015 UTC,"Why should I be forced to shoot indoors? Just to put the shoe on the other foot, if you do not like the shooting then maybe YOU should stay indoors."
Colorado,3dybjt,jsdratm,6,Mon Jul 20 16:07:59 2015 UTC,"If I put the shoe on the other foot, I'd be more considerate of the thousands around me in a pristine and beautiful mountain environment, and shoot at a shooting range so as not to say ""fuck everyone else but me"" so that families can enjoy their lives too. Freedom doesn't mean do whatever the fuck you want and everyone else can go fuck themselves. If only everyone could be unselfish and considerate with their freedom! Then we wouldn't NEED such laws!"
Colorado,3dybjt,__PROMETHEUS__,2,Mon Jul 20 16:14:05 2015 UTC,"I'm with this person. No problem with guns. I fully understand the law. It's just an issue of what a person can do and what a person should do. You need to be aware when your use of the space, though legal, is impeding someone else's ability to also enjoy the space in a reasonable way. The law is the law, but the law more often represents the minimum threshold for courtesy as opposed to the mark we are fully capable of hitting. Responsible gun ownership is about more than safely operating a firearm. It's about using it in a socially-conscious way, which ensures that others will continue to see your right as worthwhile to protect and to see you, as a person, are being a good steward and practitioner of that right."

Should all of the police go shoot indoors so the visitors to the park are not disturbed?"
Colorado,3dybjt,Bodie217,9,Mon Jul 20 16:32:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that the solution is to find a different place to camp. I'm not asking anyone to do anything.   I'm just saying....let me give you an example...If I was in a heavy metal band, and I jammed so loud in my garage that everyone else in my otherwise quiet neighborhood could hear me, and they all complained to the police. The police say, ""Well, legally, they can play as loud as they want, until 10:00pm"" So I tell my neighbors, ""Well...too bad. You heard the cop. I want to play, which means I don't care that you have children who go to bed at 8:00pm. I'm going to play anyway."" The result, everyone in my neighborhood would hate me, and their only solution would be to sell their house and move somewhere else, hoping that the new neighborhood they moved into didn't have that issue.   My point is that with a little common courtesy and adult discretion, that entire situation can be avoided with a little compromise from both sides. I will move to a different camp site, and the people shooting the guns will do NOTHING. Who is changing to make who happy here? Your logic is circular, and ultimately selfish."

Colorado,3dybjt,xicougar106,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:46:57 2015 UTC,"""a few ranges""?? I go to gun ranges to shoot occasionally, because I like to shoot, but there are gun ranges all over the place in the metro Denver area. It's possible you don't live in Denver, but I saw 3 driving through Ft. Collins on my way back. Go to Google maps and type ""Gun ranges"" in the search and you'll see them all over the state with the exception of places like Trinidad or Telluride. I was always under the impression that Colorado was one of the more gun friendly states with the way my family and friends talk about it.   Anyway, I've lived in Colorado for a while and been camping dozens of times, even in the same general area, and have never had this happen. So I was not aware that I'd have to do any ""homework"", but I will definitely do so in the future."
Colorado,3dybjt,riomx,4,Mon Jul 20 22:51:02 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind that many indoor ranges are either pistol only, or are way too short for any decent rifle shooting.  If someone wants to shoot at over 100 yards, indoor ranges aren't an option whatsoever."

If it isn't shooting, it's partying past midnight when you know families are around, or the like. Disrespectful people are disrespectful, and it's the ones with guns that risk responsible gun owners' rights.  There are plenty of places to shoot recreationally with great backdrops and far away from campers/houses, but there's also not a good way to find them (other than word of mouth), and there's no consequence for bad behavior."
Colorado,3dybjt,xicougar106,0,Tue Jul 21 04:17:44 2015 UTC,I've looked at going to an indoor range. All the clubs are fully booked. Plus it's loud to shoot indoors.

Colorado,3dybjt,jhc1415,3,Mon Jul 20 23:59:56 2015 UTC,In my experience gun owners are generally too lazy to backpack in anywhere to target shoot and they only shoot near roads.  So the best way to get away from them is to backpack in at least a mile from the nearest road.  Unfortunately they are so noisy that their gunshots can be heard miles away.
Colorado,3dybjt,tasty-fish-bits,16,Mon Jul 20 16:15:53 2015 UTC,"You could pack your ammo, guns, and targets into a backpack and hoof it into the backcountry, or you could lay it all out in the back of your truck - which seems more convenient?"

It requires $400, 30 minutes, and the effort of one person to hopefully preserve the lives of three others.   There are societal actions that need to happen, but in the short term the best way of helping situations like this is the way that can be done quickly, effectively, and independently. One should not have to wait on legislation and the will of others to preserve their livelihood. This is why one should have ready access to equalizing forces in the unfortunate event of violent action from another person.   Or to put it bluntly: this is why you got to stay strapped."

Proper services could have simply defused the situation without threats or violence needing to get involved.  Addendum;  This could not have been rectified by a Mexican standoff lasting until societal change occurred."
Colorado,3dstdx,Reicht,6,Sun Jul 19 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"Let's deconstruct this argument to see where it breaks down. As I had previously stated that I agreed with you about needing societal changes to occur to help promote the safety of everyone.   Your argument was literally ""Mutually assured destruction could have delayed the problem until something else happened.""   My argument was not about MAD. It was about the the ineffectiveness of asymmetric force distribution. The man set out with intent to kill, or was spurned to do so after the fact. The best solution here which involves a gun is one in which everyone leaves the confrontation with their lives. I was merely pointing out a situation in which this could have happened. The gun could have allowed for the police to arrive and handled the situation. An even better argument for the ownership of a weapon is one in which the would-be attacker knows that his ex-wife is an avid shooter and decides not to go through with the attack at all.   While completely ignoring the ramifications that pulling a gun escalates the situation   The situation was a murder about to be committed. Myself, Congress, and the CRS all agree that this is the exact situation in which an escalation of force is not only the preferred solution, but it's sometimes the only one which allows the innocent party to escape with their lives.   to where maybe they pull a gun   If the attacker is potentially in possession of a weapon, there doesn't seem to be any question as to weather deadly force is an acceptable response to this situation.   then it is down to stupidity, aim, and chance to see just how horrific the situation becomes.   It seems that herein lies the core belief which you have on weapons. It would seem that you associate their owners with stupidity, their actions with random chance, and their only potential outcome as being horrific. Which I feel is pretty far from the truth. Legal firearm owners are the vast majority of firearms owners in America and their ability to pass background checks and every day live their lives in a peaceful and morally conscious manner seems to speak to the fact that they are by and large, reasonably intelligent and moral people.   Proper services could have simply defused the situation without threats or violence needing to get involved.   If you could please explain the types of services which would have stopped this. Because from what I'm getting it's either a Minority Report-esque type of law enforcement which uses precognition to stop crime before it happens or the types of societal change which would make people never commit crime. Both seem equally fanciful and are frankly, not the world we live in. As i stated previously: I agree that these are the types of changes which need to happen, but in the meantime, there are measures which we can take as individuals to be personally accountable for our own safety.   Addendum; This could not have been rectified by a Mexican standoff lasting until societal change occurred.   I'm not even sure what you're trying to say here."

Colorado,3ds61t,chili420indenver,28,Tue Jul 21 06:49:49 2015 UTC,"Well, several reasons.   Primarily, the population increase.  I-25 from SH-7 to SH-66 was actually just widened to 6 lanes in 2009.  Since 2009 the population of the Denver metro area has increased by 200,000 people or 8.29%.  The cities north of the Denver MSA have also grown.  FoCo has added 11,000 people since 2010.  I'd imagine Longmont and Loveland have similar growth.  Sometimes those people wanna travel to Denver.  I-25 south of SH-7 has been six lanes for quite a while, even with rapid population growth.  Point being is that not a lot has been done infrastructure-wise to accommodate the higher population. Left lane exits, bottlenecks, and ending lanes.  The 270 exit in Denver is a left lane exit and it is a heavily used highway by trucks.  Some of the congestion headed southbound is caused by  truckers trying to get into the left lane.  I've seen some truckers do it as early as 136th Ave.  That's several miles of slow trucks using the left lane.  Bottlenecks - a lot of the on ramps are not long enough to accommodate the added traffic flow.  Get on I-25N at 104th Ave, the merge ""lane"" is laughably short.  Well people are going to merge anyway, and that slows down traffic.  When the highway goes down to 2 lanes at SH-66, this also creates a backup.  I have noticed an improvement when CDOT switched it from Left Lane Ends to Right Lane Ends.   Lack of alternatives.  There is no other way for people who live in Northern Colorado to access the I-70 corridor or south Denver.  E-470 is not a valid bypass because it's so damn expensive, very few people would be willing to shell out $13.50 (one-way with expresstoll pass) to get through Denver.  The price would have to be reduced (imo) by at least 50% in order to make it attractive to drivers, which won't happen because it can't.  (E-470 is contractually obligated to raise their rates per their bonds).  The Northwest Parkway is also not a viable option because it only goes to US-36 and it's $3.60 toll isn't worth it to a lot of people.  So, people are stuck using I-25 to get to the south part of the city or the mountains.         Now, I am aware of the paradox (proper word?) that states that widening a highway is only a short term solution because people will eventually fill it and you will be at status quo again.  But, something needs to be done in order to accommodate for the increasing population.  I-25 needs to be widened to six lanes all the way to SH-14 (probably should go to Wellington honestly, it can stop there because only crazy people like to go to Cheyenne).  Yea, there would still be traffic, but three lanes on each side is a huge improvement compared to a two lane road.  I'd also like to see a completion of the 470 loop.  Getting a highway that connects from the western metro area to the northern metro area would divert all the mountain traffic to the loop instead of forcing them to go I-25 to I-76 to I-70.  However, this road would either need to be a public road or have a reasonable tolls.  It cannot follow the existing high priced toll patterns of E-470 and the Northwest Parkway (I say this in regards to decreasing traffic flow on I-25).           Hopefully, within the next few years, we should see the light rail completed for the northern suburbs (I for one am looking forward to the N line).  This should reduce some of the traffic into downtown.  But what do we have to look forward to right now?  Tolled express lanes!  Yay.  We already see US-36 with these things, soon I-25 between I-270 and 120th will have them too.  I really hope they do not continue them all the way to Fort Collins.  I can see it now, for the low low price of $20, you can get to Fort Collins quicker, and don't worry if you want to get back to Denver quicker, it will only be $20 more!    Anyway, that is my layman's opinion.  Even if everything was added, we'd still have traffic issues.  I-25 south of the city is a perfect example of this (T-Rex project), however it does flow smoother during off-peak hours than I-25 north of the city does."

I've heard of that before. I wonder if it applies to widening a 2-lane stretch of a 3-lane highway. Reducing number of lanes is always the worst traffic I ever see, on any road, cos we can't merge for shit.  Similarly, there are other pain points that directly contribute to stop-and-go that aren't related to number of lanes. Tricky onramps/offramps, rubbernecking, and elephant races could be mitigated with spot fixes without having to make the whole freeway 6 lanes."

Colorado,3ds61t,ndrew452,2,Sun Jul 19 06:07:52 2015 UTC,"To be clear that's not 2 to 3, that's a highway that is mostly 3 but has spots of 2, and we widen those spots of 2 to match the rest of the whole darn highway. For an easy example, think of when construction narrows I-70 from 3 lanes to 2 for a quarter mile. It's a short stretch of road, and I-70 is no picnic with 3 lanes either, but that constriction all by itself basically creates hell on earth, stopping cars for miles back. (Again mostly because we are bad at merging)  I agree that 2 to 3 seems a lot more useful than 3 to 4 or what have you. It mostly fixes elephant races, for starters."

We can't support higher ed in this state, but we should spend billions to support people who want to live in the Springs/FoCo/Castle Rock but work downtown?  The corridor should be a toll road based on usage. You drive it 3x times a week you pay nothing, but 5+ and those 4th and 5th trips are expensive. More construction will just turn Denver into the LA of the Rockies."
Colorado,3ds61t,ploden,5,Sun Jul 19 18:52:52 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's exactly what I said.  There is too much population for a simple two lane highway.  You will still see congestion with three lanes, but it won't be as bad - that's what I was trying to get across.  There is no cure to remove congestion, but you can make it a bit better, especially in off peak hours.  If there is even a sizeable population of people that live in FoCo or the Springs and work in downtown, they really aren't adding to the traffic.  I-25 can't support weekend traffic, in which almost no one is commuting to work, but traveling to places.    Living near downtown Denver is not possible for everyone.  Maybe you can afford paying $2000 a month for a 1 bedroom apartment, but a lot of people can't."

At the end of the day the pro-legalization efforts in Colorado heavily played the ""poor wounded veteran"" card and pushed the idea that weed helps vets with PTSD.

I've heard conflicting things here but consensus seems to be that medicinal is cheaper in most places) and most likely not covered by any sort of insurance or disability.  So the end result is the same group of people who used a medical issue to push the legalization of recreational marijuana are now - surprise surprise - stuck using the more expensive recreational marijuana."
Colorado,3dmj1n,lgroeni,3,Fri Jul 17 18:52:20 2015 UTC,Wait what? I don't think I can recall an instance in Colorado where during the legalize pot issue that it needing to be more accessible to veterans came up. Can you elaborate?
Colorado,3dmj1n,ninjames101,0,Fri Jul 17 19:02:16 2015 UTC,"Remember how the first purchaser in colorado was a veteran?.  That wasn't by accident - it was a PR stunt. He wasn't a random vet with PTSD - he had long been a part of the medical marijuana industry, and the Yes on A64 campaign even featured him.  Note that i'm not saying any of this is good or bad - just that it was part of the back story on why vets are so pissed off about it."
Colorado,3dmj1n,lgroeni,5,Fri Jul 17 20:40:55 2015 UTC,"""Colorado’s Chief Medical Officer Larry Wolk recommended the state approve the condition.""  Are the board members that voted no even doctors?"

So, sort of a doctor?"

He's a PHD   The person you replied to said ""no knowledge in the subject""  The man we are talking about has a PhD in Public Health, he's not a doctor. He doesn't have the medical knowledge necessary to be making a decision regarding the use Marijuana as a treatment for PTSD.   The Chief Medical Officer does have the knowledge and actually recommended to approve marijuana as a treatment for PTSD.  So not only is he not qualified to make the decision, the decision he made actually goes against what the top medical professional of the state has recommended."
Colorado,3dmj1n,fxgn,4,Fri Jul 17 23:56:16 2015 UTC,I agree with the veterans. However they can still get a prescription for MMJ in CO the same way everyone else does. Go to a the weed doctor and say you have severe pain. To think the VA is going to prescribe it before it is federally decriminalized is wishful thinking. I doubt that in those other 10 states that recognize PTSD as a condition for MMJ it is prescribed at the VA.  I imagine they are already conducting studies of cannabis given to people with PTSD though

Colorado,3djvq3,HarryScrotes,3,Fri Jul 17 08:54:09 2015 UTC,"I don't really hate California, it's just funny to say stuff like that. And for the crops, it's part of the reason their in a drought. If they pushed some of their growing  to the south east, there would be a lot less of a drought problem in cali. But who is going to give up their cash crops?  El Niño has been going on for longer than expected for the last decade. Sure that isn't their fault, but Ocean Current experts are beginning to suspect that this is just the new norm, as opposed to the traditional cycle. It's something that the west coast should adjust to as opposed to just 'waiting it out'."
Colorado,3djvq3,Dragish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:07:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, California grows something like 75% of the variety of produce in the nation. Which is why it uses so much water to grow all the crops making this drought such a major problem. There's lots of crops that you couldn't grow in other parts of the country though, the southeast gets way too hot and is too wet. California has the perfect climate for growing most things. Maybe they are semi correct, but it isn't likely California will stay in a drought to this extent. It has always gone back and forth historically. In the 70s there was a really bad drought in CA and everyone was on water rations, then In the 90s in was raining so an much there was flooding everywhere and houses were sliding off hillsides. It goes up and down.  btw what's with all the downvotes of a comment that's pro-anything except Colorado? Bunch of small minded haters.

Colorado,3dk2y0,trainercatlady,11,Fri Jul 17 12:54:29 2015 UTC,"The jury now has to decide if he will get the death penalty or life in prison without parole.  There are three phases that they have to go through in court. In the first phase the prosecution presents the jury with five ""aggravating factors"" that if they decide he committed even one of the five then he can be sentenced to death. I can't remember all five but they include things like ambushing people, intent to kill a child, etc. When the DA told us what they were in my mind he committed all five, but as I said, they only need one to move forward to the second phase.  The second phase is where the defence presents mitigating circumstances, and witnesses are called in that part. Basically they will try to present a case that he doesn't deserve to be put to death, and I assume their main argument there is that he's mentally ill, which everyone seems to agree upon. Then the prosecution can present their own witnesses as a rebuttal to the mitigating circumstances. Basically they'll be asking victims what they feel the punishment should be.  Third phase is each side making an argument that their case is stronger. Basically like a closing argument.  Then the jury will deliberate and deliver the sentence.  They expect the first phase will begin and end on Wednesday, then the second phase is all about the availability of witnesses, so that's what takes the most time."
Colorado,3dk2y0,kiptheenglish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:36:33 2015 UTC,"well they decided he was guilty, now they hear arguments if he should be put to death or not.

Colorado,3dfs7d,tallgirl32,3,Wed Jul 15 23:56:50 2015 UTC,It's been awhile since I started up a business so I would definitely consult your local Small Business group about the startup.  Once you get things registered and gather the appropriate finances contacting your local chamber of commerce can be a huge asset. They have observed many business succeed and fail. Most of the chambers won't tell you what to do but will look at what your doing and let you know what behaviors are right and what are wrong.  Depending on the business your local economic development council can also be a valuable. Especially if your business is in a sector the council is trying to develop for your locality. They have tools to get through some of the red tape more quickly if your business plan is in line with their vision for the community.   GOOD LUCK!!! Let us know when you open!

Colorado,3dfs7d,driverdave,3,Thu Jul 16 04:36:54 2015 UTC,"it depends on what kinda of business you're starting.  at the most basic level, nothing is required to start a business. you do or sell something, let the person know how much it is, and have them give you cash.  if you want to do business under a name other than your name, you'll need to file a DBA.  after than, you can do business under an LLC, s-corp, etc... it starts getting complex, and you'll probably want a CPA or lawyer to help you.  none of that involves a business plan. you want that for yourself, or if you want investors.  if your business has other licensing needs, you may need it."
Colorado,3dfs7d,DeviatedNorm,2,Thu Jul 16 04:05:52 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great question to ask for the community, but I suspect that a lot of the factors will be based on the county/city the business is registered in."

Colorado,3dh129,ajslick,5,Thu Jul 16 05:14:16 2015 UTC,"It is not legal to possess marijuana in the national forest, nor is recreational shooting allowed in national parks, which are not really public land, but federally owned land. Make sure you're in a national forest and not a national park before you go target shooting...and keep the weed discreet if you must. You're definitely not going to have a good time getting caught with that by a forest ranger if you have guns on you."
Colorado,3dh129,mesostoney,5,Thu Jul 16 05:48:08 2015 UTC,Thanks. Probably best to keep the weed at home then! Better safe than sorry.
Colorado,3dh129,kepleronlyknows,2,Thu Jul 16 06:05:58 2015 UTC,"national parks, which are not really public land, but federally owned land   Can you expand on that?  I can see the logic behind the statement, but despite doing legal work on NPS issues I surprisingly haven't heard much on the topic."
Colorado,3dh129,mesostoney,4,Thu Jul 16 11:34:10 2015 UTC,"I guess technically it's all owned by the federal government, but how you can use the land varies. For instance, there's an entrance fee to get into some national parks, camping usually requires a permit or reservation, especially in the backcountry. You can't engage in recreational shooting, usually can't hunt anywhere in a national park without a bunch of restrictions, and you're probably more likely to encounter a ranger in a national park. National Forests/Grasslands and BLM lands are regulated and patrolled a lot less loosely, and allow things like free dispersed camping, recreational shooting, hunting, grazing by livestock (hence the infamous Cliven Bundy issue), etc. You just feel a lot more like you're on your own land on public lands vs national parks."
Colorado,3dh129,kepleronlyknows,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:54:27 2015 UTC,"Okay, fair enough, I can see your point.  But from a legal perspective, national parks are definitely public land, even if more strictly regulated than some other public lands.    Anyway, not relevant here anyhow."
Colorado,3dh129,mesostoney,2,Thu Jul 16 16:06:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, allow me to correct myself. Both technically federal property, and both technically public land (as conflicting as that sounds), but one is undoubtedly much more developed and controlled, and another just feels a lot more like public land. When I'm in the forest I feel like I'm in a gigantic extension of my backyard, and thus get rightly pissed when I find that people haven't cleaned up their broken glass, left their fire smoldering, or didn't bury their TP, or whatever. It doesn't feel as personal in a National Park, it just feels more like a tourist destination I guess."
Colorado,3dh129,digitalstimulus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:18:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It makes me cringe to see these types of things. I came from Kansas and people definitely do not respect public lands there. Most city and state parks are just littered with trash. Granted, Kansas doesn't really compare to the grandeur of Colorado either way."
Colorado,3dh129,Zon3g,2,Thu Jul 16 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"If you are in Northern Colorado, check out the Baker Draw Designated Shooting Area in the Pawnee Grasslands.  http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/arp/recarea?recid=80588  It is up by Ault, about 1 hour from Fort Collins.  There is no entrance fee (or staff), but it is a well known shooting area so your experience may vary each visit depending on what other shooters are there and their experience levels.  National Forest is another option, NOT the National Park.  Also discharging a firearm while consuming alcohol is highly illegal where we are, so I wouldn't push it too much with the MMJ.  Definitely be very discreet and smart with your usage, only consume enough to keep you going for the medical reasons if needed.  You don't want to come across the law with obvious effects of alcohol or marijuana while shooting firearms.  MMJ in the vehicle also cannot be kept anywhere that is accessible by the driver.  From our interpretation of the law, even the child proof containers in the passenger seat would be ""accessible by the driver"".  The container doesn't necessarily have to be open.  If you really want to be paranoid, you can just transport both the MMJ and firearms in the trunk and call it good.  I just also want to add for other readers that I frown on any recreational alcohol or marijuana use while shooting firearms.  Please be safe."

That definition isn't arbitrary; it's determined by legislation.  ""We"" (that is to say, proponents of A64) are ""suddenly okay"" with people making money from cannabis sales because now it's actually regulated and taxed - the two key features that distinguish white and black markets. Again, not arbitrary.   Are we also glad that this money is going to the school in stead of the legal dispensaries?   Legal cannabis is taxed 28%. If that tax revenue weren't being collected, it wouldn't go to the dispensaries, it would remain in the pockets of consumers. So yes, obviously we're ""glad"" the revenue is going to schools - that's a key reason the bill passed in the first place.   why are we emotionally disparaging against the people who were selling it illegally before?   Are you seriously this dense? Let's think - why would we, the people, oppose an untaxed, unregulated, under-the-table economy? Here's a theory: it might possibly have something to do with tens of millions of dollars of revenue going unreported to the federal and state governments, quite probably funding organized crime like harder drugs, human trafficking, and deadly firearms.

Freedom of speech exists solely for speech you don't agree with. Popular speech, by definition, needs no protection. If you hate gay people, or black people, or white people, then that speech should be protected. Not because I agree with it, but because I believe freedom of speech is so essential to a free society that without the ability to make speech others disagree with, a free society does not exist. Besides, words are just words, and cannot cause harm. People need to become stronger, not protected from hearing collections of syllables that make them feel sad."

Popular speech needs no protection. If people cannot engage in unpopular speech, then what is the point of the first amendment? I have absolutely no problem with gay people, but Colorado is engaging in some pretty crazy anti-freedom legislation lately. If someone doesn't like gay people, then they should be free to say as much. I think bullying should be covered by existing harassment laws, but I'm not sure. This is similar to how that cake shop closed it's doors because they wouldn't bake a cake for a gay wedding.

In both cases, freedom of speech and freedom of association have been replaced with gags and force.again, I have no problem with gay peoe at all, but they are using the government to limit freedom."
Colorado,3dbkgx,Jooceyjooce,-4,Wed Jul 15 22:28:01 2015 UTC,"The problem is that freedom of speech walks a very thin line when it comes to bullying, especially in schools. For example, if a white bully were to call a black kid a nigger, and then he got sent to the principal's office and suspended, is that not infringing on his first amendment rights? After all, he got in trouble just for saying words. The reality of it is: the constitutional rights of youths are seldom recognized until they're not youths anymore.  EDIT: regardless of whether or not you agree with Gardner's decision, am I really wrong for what I said in this comment? Please, someone let me know rather than bring down the downvote brigade."
Colorado,3dbkgx,highinthemountains,2,Wed Jul 15 22:28:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that the question you posed presents a problematic situation. It is a shame that we don't recognize that youth have rights until the become a certain age. This teaches them that rights aren't really rights at all, but rather that the government is the entity that gives you rights and takes them away, rather than the government being an entity that recognizes and protects rights that we already have. The role of the government in society has been completely switched from one that protects the people and enforces contracts, to one that dictates to the people what they can and cannot do. This is not good, and it is becoming more frightening in scope with every piece of legislation like this that passes. I think public education is also an area that needs to be addressed. I see no reason why the government should be instructing our children with regards to what is what. They should not be telling them anything."

I was sitting at a restaurant with the only friend I had I had, a Hispanic female with kids. A stranger came up and told me that it was great that I would stoop to marry a Hispanic girl.

Imagine a world where we were not drug tested."
Colorado,3cwqsz,fromks,10,Sat Jul 11 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think it's fair. Do you really think that someone who smokes a joint the night before is worse than someone who drinks a 6pack?   And to be fair, a job like you describe is an extreme example. To use that as a reason to continue drug testing people answering phones is absurd."
Colorado,3cwqsz,bahnzo,5,Sat Jul 11 23:25:35 2015 UTC,"I have (bounded) faith in capitalism. I suspect that if drug abuse DIDN'T increase the healthcare risk, the insurance companies wouldn't be giving kickbacks to encourage testing. It would be completely wasted money on their part.  Just because you answer phones for a living doesn't mean a cocaine habit isn't going to land you in the hospital, racking up medical bills.  I don't like insurance companies, but I believe that their price discrimination is generally based on truth. It's literally their business to understand risk factors. That's how they make money and stay competitive."

Colorado,3cwqsz,bahnzo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:01:11 2015 UTC,"The assumption that a drug user is irresponsible and will cost a company is a fairy tale.   The assumption isn't necessarily about irresponsibility.  Its litigation.  If someone who is abusing substances runs over another employee with a forklift, the hurt employee is going to hire a lawyer and that lawyer, almost without exception, is going to clean house.  Not so much if both employees are sober and one hurts another and it can be choked up to an honest mistake.  Since corporations pay for liability, workers comp and unemployment insurance the same as you or I have liability insurance on our cars, the insurance company adjusts rates as it sees fit given their risk models, the same as how our insurance on our cars increases as we get more speeding tickets or cause more accidents.  I would be VERY surprised if companies don't generally have better help by drug testing, even though I think drug testing generally discriminates in a way that is IMHO unacceptable against potheads, especially considering that a tweeker can pass the same test 2-3 days after smoking meth.  I'm not so worried about the weekend warrior pothead running me over with a forklift.  The tweeker will run me over with a forklift then steal all the copper out of the building."

The article talks a lot about pot, but advocates getting rid of drug testing altogether, not just pot.   If you want to narrow that to just pot for the sake of this discussion, then so be it but that's not what the article is saying.  It essentially says, if people are using drugs in their free time and aren't high at work, they shouldn't have to undergo drug testing.  Spoken like a person who has no skin in the game and has never owned a business.  In part, it goes back to the issue that there is no way to tell if someone is high at work unless they're obviously symptomatic.  That, however, isn't acceptable as it's too subjective.   Just because people get high at home, doesn't mean they won't do it at work and in most jobs it is either detrimental to the company or the customer, or simply dangerous to be high at work. It doesn't just have to be a doctor or an airline pilot, either.  A cabbie driving a 5000 pound vehicle can be just as deadly.  The cashier who is stoned won't do their job right and may be making mistakes that cost the company money.  The mechanic might not put my brakes back together properly.   If you're the guy that owns the business, and you can mitigate the POTENTIAL risk that these may happen by hiring people that don't do drugs, I can't see why you wouldn't."

The first is that there is an objective test for alcohol intoxication, where as for drugs like marijuana, cocaine and meth, there is not.  Unless you're exhibiting symptoms, who knows if you're impaired while driving that semi down the highway.  The idea is to avoid the problem altogether by only hiring people who don't do drugs in the first place.    The second part comes from the employer's perspective.  Not only have they invested their money and time into whatever business, it's also their livelihood.  You count on your employees to do good work, and to be safe in what they do.   Problems with either of these will cost you money/business and increase your liability.  They don't, nor should they, care about the fact that someone likes to get high/drunk/stoned/shoots up in their free time.  They just want to avoid any potential issues related to it by screening those folks out on the front end.  I can't say I blame them."

One of the drugs tested for is cannabis, and the tests we use are not looking for any active THC in my system. Just if it is at all.

These are simply examples of situations where most people wouldn't want a drug addict doing a service for them.  As an aside, many trades including electricians would be subject to drug testing at hire.  Also, some independent contractor or employee physician contracts have clauses that can include drug testing.  I have one in mine."
Colorado,3cwqsz,AcuteAppendagitis,2,Sun Jul 12 11:50:24 2015 UTC,"Corporate companies follow federal and not state laws, so while you get all the ""local"" companies in the state to not test for pot (and I'm sure many don't bother anymore either), the national businesses won't budge until the federal law changes. I used to work for the big ""W"" and traveled to a store in Denver and up in Steamboat to help out with their problems, and the reason why you don't see any workers around isn't because they're cutting shifts and the like, like it was back in Michigan for me, it's because 9/10 of applicants end up not passing the drug test. An assistant manager friend of mine tried to see if he could change that because of all the hardships we were having as a result, but corporate wouldn't budge."
Colorado,3cwqsz,QueenAlpaca,-1,Sat Jul 11 23:05:28 2015 UTC,"While I most definitely agree with the author on the medical side of it, the recreational side is a little different. This is completely dependent on the job... I don't care if sandwich Sam or code monkey Chris tokes up every night, and garbage man Greg certainly deserves a fatty after work. But there are certain jobs which require more responsibility, and less room for outside influence, however minor it may be. Surgeon, pilot, and cop come to mind.   I'm not saying weed will cause them to fuck up on the job, only that it could. There are certain jobs that I think should still require testing. So making it illegal to test across the board just sounds like a bad idea. Again, produce Pete should have every right to hit the bong after his shift, but firefighter Fred probably shouldn't, unless of course it's for medical purposes.  edit: I would like to remind downvoters that the downvote button is not a ""disagree"" button. My response is a response that will be seen the more that this is discussed. It's important that people talk about it, even if you disagree with me."
Colorado,3cwqsz,LethargicMonkey,13,Sat Jul 11 16:18:07 2015 UTC,"Do you think a surgeon would be smart enough to know that he shouldn't get baked right before going to work? A surgeon isn't just some dude who happened to get lucky and got hired as a surgeon. He's a man with incredible intelligence and work ethic, enough to finish his schooling and get his degree. This man has incredible responsibility to bear all day long, the lives of people hang in the balance. Why wouldn't you trust this man with the relatively small responsibility of responsible marijuana use? All surgeons in the United States are free to use alcohol at any time. The vast majority of them do not operate while intoxicated. Would you agree that surgeons should never be allowed to drink alcohol because it could impair their ability to operate? If you can trust him with your life, you can trust him with a joint."
Colorado,3cwqsz,God_of_gaps,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:41:41 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I would trust a surgeon who smoked a bowl the night before as much as I would trust a surgeon who had a glass of scotch the night before. I wouldn't trust a surgeon who toked a few dabs the night before though, the same as I wouldn't trust a surgeon who drank a fifth of whisky the night before.   I know they worked hard to get where they are, but that doesn't make them magically immune to mistakes. And if a mistake was made and they tested positive for any drug, it would be to blame, even if it wasn't the cause. So why introduce that risk into the equation? In a perfect world we could all get high and it would be fine... but is it really worth the risk, however minor, when dealing with people's lives every day, just so they can get high?   If there was some magic test that could determine quantity then yes I absolutely think it should be implemented for alcohol, marijuana, everything. But there's not, and it's my opinion that people in jobs like this should refrain from recreational marijuana use in order to provide utmost confidence in their abilities."
Colorado,3cwqsz,LethargicMonkey,-7,Sat Jul 11 17:59:45 2015 UTC,While both alcohol and marijuana intoxicate an individual for several hours the last effects of marijuana are much greater for up to 48hrs even in reasonable doses when compared to alcohol whose lasting effects can range anywhere from 8-12hrs. The Surgeon who drank a glass the night before can awake refreshed and clearheaded whereas the surgeon who smoked a bowl the night before can wake up with lingering vestiges of the drug. Alcohol =/=  Marijuana and you can't compare them like apples to apples.

Alcohol has been proven to cause psychomotor impairment with moderate drinking, and those effects persist after drunkenness fades. So it is fair to compare them... In fact I would say alcohol should be viewed as more dangerous. Not that marijuana should be ignored.  For marijuana impairment studies see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3534640/  http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/job185drugs/cannabis.htm (under duration of effects)"
Colorado,3cwqsz,LethargicMonkey,2,Sat Jul 11 20:01:41 2015 UTC,Not just that but Firefighters and surgeons don't work 5 days then two days off.

It's a tray of orange juice. They each take a few sips and it tastes a little weird, realize it's got champagne in it. They didn't have enough to feel any effects, but you're not allowed to have any alcohol within 12 hours of flying; they had to back out of the flight and an alternate flight crew had to be brought in.

If the only medicine that works for some cop is marijuana, then he shouldn't lose his job over it. If another cop doesn't need it, why allow her to smoke all the time and introduce the risk of a poor judgement call, however minor it may be? We wouldn't want cops taking pain killers all the time, yet if one recently had surgery and has residual pain, he should be allowed them, right?"

Colorado,3cm9na,cardslinger1989,3,Thu Jul 9 00:32:27 2015 UTC,"Do you have a 4 wheel drive SUV? Medano Pass has loads of camp spots and are less crowded than the pay spots right by the dunes. A ""high clearance 4 wheel drive"" is required tho. I've done the trail loads of times in my stock Jeep Cherokee   Edit: Just realized that it looks like you want to camp on the dunes themselves? If so you can, it requires a permit, and looks to be a pain in the ass to set up a tent/not have everything covered in sand lol. But good luck!"
Colorado,3cm9na,stoney5280,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:40:56 2015 UTC,Medano Pass    Ive been wanting to do this pass all the way through but it was late in opening this year...looks like a lot of fun.  I went a few miles in from the Dune side.
Colorado,3cm9na,SteelChicken,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:19:37 2015 UTC,"I've gone pretty far up the pass but never all the way over. Had a couple friends do it and say its really not that great lol. I just like the creek crossings and there is one particular camp spot that is amazing up there, has its own little driveway and round-about lol."
Colorado,3cm9na,stoney5280,10,Thu Jul 9 14:41:49 2015 UTC,If you want to camp on the dunes themselves just hike in a ways. Start in the late afternoon because the initial climb is rough. You don't won't to be on the dunes anytime near midday without shade.   Otherwise there are a few campsites around. I usually use freecampsites.com but I think that's mostly for car camping not hiking in camping.   Or call up the park and ask a park Ranger. I'm sure they know a bunch.   /u/arcanefries did some camping in them recently it looks like.
Colorado,3cm9na,devilbird99,2,Thu Jul 9 01:00:57 2015 UTC,"Camping is allowed in the dunes themselves? I've been there four times and have never seen campsites. Agreed that the sun is rough during the summer, and to that point I'd recommend camping in the surrounding mountainous areas, with day-hikes into the dunes (that is, if you're backpacking). That way you can retreat when too hot. You can camp within a 20-minute hike from the dunes. If you aren't backpacking, and would like to stay in immediate vicinity of your car, then there are tons of camping sites along the main road that heads into the Park.  The rangers are super nice and extremely helpful, in my experience. They'll definitely have the answers you're looking for."
Colorado,3cm9na,indydiddle,6,Thu Jul 9 02:07:36 2015 UTC,"You have to snag a backpacking permit from the Visitor Center to camp in the dunefield. First come first served, so I tend to show up before 9:30 on days I want to camp there because of how few they hand out. They stipulate that you have to hike a quarter mile beyond the first ridge of dunes, and from there the world is your campsite. I would, however, disagree with /u/devilbird99 on the whole ""hike in late"" notion. The dunes are notorious for thunderstorms that roll in between 3:30 and 4:30 pm and last for around an hour to two hours. That could put you hiking in as late as 7, meaning it'll start getting dark soon, making setup a major bitch. I started my hike in both times before 9:30 am, set up camp during the calm, slightly cooler part of the morning, then gallivanted around without the weight of my pack or took a nap in my tent. Sure, it's a bit warm, but it's not unbearable. The wind that whips up before and continues after the storm makes setting up camp nearly impossible, and it's as calm as can be in the morning.   Any questions anyone might have, I'd be happy to answer"
Colorado,3cm9na,ArcaneFries,3,Thu Jul 9 05:34:54 2015 UTC,Yes you can! My girlfriend and I went there in March. Snapped this pic  Free permit to camp in the dunes at the visitor center.
Colorado,3cm9na,firevice,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:55:02 2015 UTC,"that is so cool. So i'm guessing when people camp, they do so out of sight of the main park entrance?"
Colorado,3cm9na,indydiddle,4,Fri Jul 10 00:50:26 2015 UTC,Camping is allowed in the dunes themselves. See the users I linked most recent post. He posted in this very subreddit a few weeks ago with pics from doing it.   Campsite wise it's not right at the dunes. You continue past the turnoff for the dunes in the park and there is a small campground area right in the mountains within the park.
Colorado,3cm9na,devilbird99,2,Thu Jul 9 02:18:01 2015 UTC,"I usually camp at Zapata falls and drive to the dunes, just buy a week pass and you can come and go as you please. The climate near zapata is also a lot more comfortable than the dunes and is a lot more predictable. Zapata is also an awesome waterfall and the view is spectacular, you can see the entire San Luis valley. It is a 10 minute drive to the dunes and it is so worth camping outside of the national park for many reasons beyond the crowds."
Colorado,3cm9na,UzukiSeed,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:09:08 2015 UTC,"Before you get to the campsite in the park there is a trail that climbs up a small valley. If you get a permit you can camp up there though campsites aren't great (not a lot of flat spots), though there are trees for shade and a stream for water below. If you hike further up you can get into the San Juan area when you get to the top of the valley. This is still less than 5 miles if I remember correctly and may be free dispersed camping (check with a ranger)."
Colorado,3cm9na,gusty_state,-2,Thu Jul 9 14:06:22 2015 UTC,Why would you want to camp in the sand dunes? There are lots of great camping sites in the vicinity of the park that are much more suitable than setting up a tent in the sand.

Colorado,3cgco5,SmartToaster,12,Wed Jul 8 01:59:06 2015 UTC,"Marriage licenses are not, and cannot  be duplicated by contracts. Wills, medical powers of attorney, are a weak patch work compared to the rights granted under marriage. As a gay man who's had to consider what happens if I'm injured, or what happens when I'm gone, the legal options available to me before where limited, and easily challenged by family members. What a marriage license confirms is rights that are recognized by the state, that are acknowledged to supersede some existing ones, and grants you status as closest family member. No other contract in our legal system can do that.  You think its simply easy because you've never had to really think about, you've never had to hear the stories, and you've never had to worry, because your position in society goes unquestioned. We can now plan for retirement, and know when we die our hard earned benefits are not stripped from our partners. We know our husbands do not have to fight bigoted family members in court to stay in their homes, and when we're injured it cannot be questioned they can be by our side, as well as make decisions when we cannot.  Edit: if you find a contract more acceptable than by all means simply sign a contract, but do not want to take away rights, that we have fought so hard for, simply for your petty preference."
Colorado,3cgco5,pinkottah,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:01:16 2015 UTC,"The point is that a marriage license is essentially a contract, just one that same-sex couples weren't allowed to sign previously.   A marriage license is a contract that allows someone all of the privileges you just mentioned. I say we call this contract a civil union and require every couple to have one for their union to be recognized by the state, homo or hetero. Call the religious ceremony ""marriage"", it's just a word and they can have it. I'm sure some gay church or gay-supportive church can arise and have their own ""marriage"" ceremonies."

Nobody is suggesting that those protections go away. Just that the government doesn't have to issue those protections, and they should be more of an agreement between two people. What does the government do to enforce marriage licenses? Nothing. You have to bring your spouse to court yourself if they breach the contract of your marriage.  Remember, we're just talking about the process of going to the state and filing for a marriage license.

If the hospital or your souses family tries to keep you from their bedside, they will have a bad day. The best a contract will do is guarantee a day in court after your spouse is dead. You also end up stuck with inheritance taxes and the like on your own home and communal property if your spouse dies without protections. Hell, testifying against your spouse cant be guaranteed against by a contract.   With all the same exact legal protections that ""marriage"" offers now.   Contracts are guarantees between two parties. They are not protections. they can only cover some of the things covered by marriage.

Colorado,3cgco5,Fiver2,-4,Wed Jul 8 00:23:59 2015 UTC,Show me where I said that?
Colorado,3cguwv,3031983,16,Tue Jul 7 20:25:50 2015 UTC,"I have lived and traveled in countries where tipping doesn't exist unless the server went above and beyond.  I've had good and bad service there and here in the U.S.   Wait staff here in the U.S. Are perceptibly more attentive than most other places, and I think tipping plays a part in it.      That said, it is nice to just pay your bill at the end of the meal and not think about it.    In the end, I won't be going to this restaurant because I don't like the way they are going about it with the 20% surcharge.  All that does is just piss people off at the end of the meal and will likely end up hurting them in the end.  The right way would be just to raise prices by 20% and be done with it.    Edit:  Spelling"
Colorado,3cguwv,AcuteAppendagitis,12,Tue Jul 7 21:36:24 2015 UTC,However they are adding a 20% service charge to the bill. Apparently that is different than tipping 20%.
Colorado,3cguwv,maddslacker,4,Tue Jul 7 20:26:26 2015 UTC,"As in .. it will get taxed.  Also, what if they deliver crappy service? Do I still get a 20% service charge?"
Colorado,3cguwv,ColoradoJustice,14,Tue Jul 7 20:46:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, just like you do everywhere else.  Complain to management about bad service, like you do with any other business.  Tipping is a terrible way to pay under the table."
Colorado,3cguwv,rwanger,2,Tue Jul 7 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"This argument seems logical, but it's not true. I've read that the average tip only fluctuates by 4%. Yes, people only give 4% extra for good service compared to bad service.  And pay-for-performance has also been shown to be one of the least effective means of incentivizing employees...and is often worse than not doing it at all."
Colorado,3cguwv,timm0113,2,Wed Jul 8 06:53:59 2015 UTC,Freakonomics covered tipping one an episode of their podcast. They concluded tipping is inefficient and should be eliminated altogether.
Colorado,3cguwv,dimmiedisaster,23,Wed Jul 8 12:34:53 2015 UTC,"A 20% surcharge to the bill?      Uh, no thank you.  Just charge what your food and service is worth in the first place.  If the raw materials and service to prepare and serve me a burger value at $12, say your going to charge me $12.   Don't tell me you are going to charge me $10 and then add on a 20% fee, it just makes me resentful."
Colorado,3cguwv,Darkflier,4,Wed Jul 8 02:56:35 2015 UTC,"So, in other words, my bill will still be the same, but I don't have to figure out the tip, for myself.  I like this trend. Except for one thing. The waitstaff will no longer remember me as being a good tipper, and, I fear, my service may suffer as a result. But they get paid better, resulting in more money going into the local economy. Worth it, I think."
Colorado,3cguwv,LittleBigHorn22,2,Wed Jul 8 06:39:00 2015 UTC,Do they get paid better though? I knew some waitresses who would make $200 a night on tips. Now they'll be down to maybe $15 an hour.
Colorado,3cguwv,phaily,2,Wed Jul 8 18:05:54 2015 UTC,but now some of that money is going to the kitchen. i work in a kitchen and it sucks seeing the bussers walk away every night with as much cash in tips as i make in a day... and we make the same hourly.

Colorado,3cguwv,LittleBigHorn22,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:49:13 2015 UTC,"Alright then that just rebrings up the question about service.

Colorado,3cguwv,rtd131,2,Wed Jul 8 02:30:02 2015 UTC,IIRC servers typically make higher hourly salaries than kitchenstaff however the kitchenstaff works more hours.
Colorado,3cguwv,Darkflier,2,Wed Jul 8 05:17:31 2015 UTC,"Correct. The servers are normally either tipped and paid the ""Tipped minimum wage"" while kitchen staff are normally full-time employees making regular minimum wage. At the end of the year, the kitchen staff usually makes more than the servers, over all.  Also, kitchen staff, being ""Full Time"" employees, usually get insurance benefits that the part time servers don't qualify for. So the servers end up having to buy their own, or go without. Which, according to ObamaCare, they can no longer do."

If they fall below, the employer is supposed to make up the difference, but go ahead and try to prove how much you earned in tips, worked, and then fight the boss man for it.  Places that keep up this system of ""tipping"" workers creates a caste of folks who have to ""beg"" for a decent life, instead of being paid what they deserve for their time like the rest of us.  (Also a separation between servers and kitchen staff, who are actually more responsible for your food tasting decent)"
Colorado,3cguwv,Zon3g,3,Wed Jul 8 19:47:08 2015 UTC,"$2.13 is federal, state minimum for tipped workers is $5.21.

Besides, every server I know is making more like $20 an hour, mostly tax free because they don't claim the tips.   That's not on a consistent basis and usually short changes the kitchen staff.  This is the whole point of doing away with tipping, like most other countries.  It's only to evade taxes and a weird relationship between customers and servers; where they are expected to pay an ambiguous amount of their own accord for basic goods/services.   I don't think that's bad at all for a job you can do stoned and doesn't require any education.   Exactly, it's short changing the kitchen staff and others who deserve to have that spread out.  It also makes people into 'beggars' instead of 'workers'.  In the modern world we have a fixed price for fixed goods.  Why is it in restaurants do we allow this variance in what we are to pay for what we get?  Would you go to Macy's and just fork over extra 20% because the girl behind the register drew a smiley face on your receipt?  Think about it, it infantalizes the servers and regardless of how 'good' you think they have it; they are in a beggar style relationship with their customers for tips, which is demeaning."

If my server is being paid a salary why would they ever go above-and-beyond to take care of a guest?  As it is now my server has an incentive to go to bat for me as a guest. The server is my advocate.  Once the server is being paid a salary they are no longer an advocate for the guest.  And guest experience will suffer.   If the kitchen staff wants to make more money, and work less hours, get a job in the front of house.  How hard is that."

You'll go above and beyond for whomever is paying you.   Servers, no longer paid mostly by guests, will now be advocates of the restaurant.    You'll hear 'no' more often. Service will be slower because the restaurant will give the few remaining employees too many responsibilities.  I'm interested to see how it works out."

By stacking the rocks the sand/pebble undersurface was quickly being washed away by the waves and it was having an impact on the environment that they loved so much.

At the end of the day impact IS inevitable and we should attempt to minimize it, but when we take it to a level where people are complaining about stacks of rocks - or skipping stones - or maybe something like picking up and working a stick into a walking stick, it becomes as absurd as just fencing off natural areas all together.  (I know this example wasn't in this article but I have personally heard this from people talking about trails in National forests - and they used the exact same argument about LNT principals).   Natural areas are not a museum where we should simply walk through and observe quietly without touching anything.   They also shouldn't be negligently destroyed or defaced.  The reality is they are somewhere in the middle - like a playground or a park.  A place where people can go and play - but should they should also respect.    If this article had been one paragraph explaining why stacks of stones can be confusing where trails are marked with cairns, I'd upvote, agree, and go on my way. But instead it comes across as if the author knows the correct way to enjoy nature and everyone else should do it the same way.  I don't agree with that tone - and frankly its a very similar tone to the people agreeing with this article and using LNT principals as their ""proof""."
Colorado,3ck4ud,unoleian,2,Thu Jul 9 18:24:54 2015 UTC,"They also shouldn't be negligently destroyed or defaced....A place where people can go and play - but should they should also respect.   I would be interested in knowing how dislodging rocks for no good reason doesn't qualify for this. Playing advocate to a degree here, there's dozens of very public places around here where people have stacked rocks to their hearts' content and I don't bat an eye at it-- actually, some of the stacks are quite cool and very enjoyable, and there's a peculiar rock next to a public trail on the town limits where someone has taken the initiative to use rocks and sticks to make it into an ever-changing face sculpture. These are 'wildlife areas' and parks and paths close to town with many improvements and what people have done in these places doesn't feel out of place.   However, the farther out you get and the more remote it becomes, stumbling across such things where they don't need to be, it somehow starts to feel somewhat profane. That, and knowing that each isolated case on its own isn't that impactful-- a guy picked up a few rocks from a gravel beach and threw it into the lake. Big whoop. That doesn't sound like such a big deal. Now, 50 people a week have done the same thing for a year, now that gravel beach is a mudhole and the shore is sinking. I cannot look at instances of impact without thinking of them in those terms, especially as popular areas become more despoilt and the masses go on the hunt for areas still more pristine, and the pattern ultimately repeats. You're right, respect is important, which is why I at least am of the belief that we consider the purpose of our actions before we commit to them, and if they are truly necessary before we do.   Maybe I'm alone in this feeling, but that's it in a nutshell."
Colorado,3ck4ud,gooberlx,3,Thu Jul 9 18:53:07 2015 UTC,"However, the farther out you get and the more remote it becomes, stumbling across such things where they don't need to be, it somehow starts to feel somewhat profane.   Well said. Packing out 50 miles into the backcountry is, probably for most, a laborious and often solemn experience, intentionally away from humanity. Cairns without necessity is somewhat offensive to that effort.  Cairns stacked all over Chautauqua? I couldn't care less."
Colorado,3ck4ud,JingJang,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:43:01 2015 UTC,"Good reply.  I guess my thoughts are that we already DO have places where rock stacking is prohibited - or can be made to be very easily (Any land under the National Park agency, State Parks, and Local/Municipal parks)  All of the management agencies over those lands can VERY easily prohibit this behavior.     Where I have a problem is in the tone of the article, and even with LNT principals, in that really anything beyond very light hiking is not the correct and responsible way to enjoy the outdoors.  People recreate outdoors in many MANY different ways.  Some are certainly more of an impact than others but that doesn't mean that any one way is the ""right"" way.   Good discussion, and for what it is worth, this same article has been x-posted over at /r/Outdoors where the majority of people agree with you."

Colorado,3ck4ud,unoleian,13,Wed Jul 8 20:55:18 2015 UTC,A lot of comments here seem to be missing the absolute most important part of the entire article-- she's pretty much right on about the random rock stacks around the backcountry as it applies to following LNT principles. Leaving a random tower of rocks in your wake is absolutely leaving a trace. Would be best to not do it at all where it's not needed.
Colorado,3ck4ud,StinkiePete,3,Wed Jul 8 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree entirely but I also feel like the people who push their rock stacks on the rest of us have as much right to say what goes in those nature zones as the author.

Colorado,3ck4ud,starducks,0,Thu Jul 9 03:42:56 2015 UTC,"Humans paved/built over much of pristine nature, (arguably) to the benefit of mankind.  Most people don't lament over the loss of nature when it benefits them personally. Even though they might consider it un-natural. It's when it's not to their benefit that they don't like it. So it's not so much a question of ""let nature be natual"" as ""let some nature stay natural when I have no interest in it being disturbed."" Which is fair enough.  I personally don't have an opinion on rock stacking. I don't really see them often when I go out, but that's mainly because I don't do much mountain hiking probably."

Colorado,3ce3p3,Putomod,20,Tue Jul 7 04:58:43 2015 UTC,Unsafe target shooting is out of control on national forest land.   The Forest Service has been closing a lot of the informal shooting ranges that have been used on N.F. land. These ranges always become trash strewn disasters and are never perfect from a safety standpoint. At least they kept the mess in a few spots and with a good back stop can be reasonably safe. When they close them the shooting just spreads out. The trash spreads out and the danger to other forest users spreads out.   Forest Service management needs to establish designated shooting sites again and they need to be free or many people won't use them.
Colorado,3ce3p3,Schadenfreuduh,6,Tue Jul 7 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"The reason the nearest FS shooting site was closed was primarily due to safety concerns. It was a free site with no rangemaster/relied on people to self-regulate, and accidents were far too frequent, and people died (edit: I have since been made aware this range has only had one fatal accident- http://www.kktv.com/news/headlines/51308467.html). Of secondary concerns was the massive amounts of trash including brass and empty shells leftover, as well as lead contamination concerns, and the FS had to pay for cleanup.  Unfortunately these types of ranges don't appear to be the solution because poor decision-making and dumb behavior still causes problems."
Colorado,3ce3p3,megman13,2,Tue Jul 7 15:59:06 2015 UTC,"As I said before, there are certainly problems with the designated ranges, but you close them and the problem just spreads out. Shooting remains legal on the majority of N.F. land and closure of certain areas is widely ignored.   The Rampart Range shooting range was there for 20 years before it had a fatal accident. I firmly believe we are going to see stray bullet deaths far more often than that without designated shooting areas."
Colorado,3ce3p3,Schadenfreuduh,0,Tue Jul 7 16:15:16 2015 UTC,"But if you spread the problem out, there are fewer people concentrated in an area. Putting them all in one spot would seen likely to cause accidents just as easily.  I'm not sure what the solution is, I just don't accept that unsupervised and unregulated free ranges are the solution- maybe an adopt-a-range program?  There was far too much dumb shit happening at the Rampart Range shooting area, and I know plenty of folks who refused to shoot there because of unsafe behavior."
Colorado,3ce3p3,megman13,7,Tue Jul 7 16:30:54 2015 UTC,"Putting them all in one spot would seen likely to cause accidents just as easily.   No, not just as easily because you can have them shooting into a backstop.  When the Lefthand Canyon shooting range north of Boulder was closed a lot of the shooting moved to a spot west of Lyons. I used to go mountain biking there. Now when you go there you will usually find some yahoo shooting at a target he stuck to a live tree with no backstop behind it. What's beyond his target off in the forest? The trail I used to ride.   The Lefthand shooting range was a narrow slot canyon with steep tall sides. What got shot there stayed there."
Colorado,3ce3p3,Schadenfreuduh,-1,Tue Jul 7 17:01:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you have more people in front of that range- people going downrange to retrieve something, people not following basic safety principles, people sweeping each other, etc. More people in one spot is more potential accidents. Spreading them out means the potential for accidents is spread over a much larger land area, but there are fewer people around.  I'm not arguing that you're flat-out wrong, but I just don't know that unsupervised shooting ranges are actually that much safer than unsupervised non-designated areas because of the density. A supervised or regulated range is an entirely different matter.  Either way I think the core issue is poor gun safety/etiquette from a percentage of folks that are screwing up, either in the woods or on a range.  Edit: about your comment on the Yahoo shooting at a tree- you're absolutely right and that's a shit idea. My point is the guy who doesn't give a shit what's behind his target is probably gonna make horrible decisions with regards to other safety rules, like his safety, trigger finger, etc and if he's at a range with a bunch of people nearby, he can easily fuck up and cause an accident there. I could absolutely be wrong."
Colorado,3ce3p3,megman13,5,Tue Jul 7 17:16:40 2015 UTC,"Either way I think the core issue is poor gun safety/etiquette from a percentage of folks that are screwing up, either in the woods or on a range.   I think you hit the nail on the head. Gun safety was available (though not mandatory) when I was in middle school in Las Animas, CO. A couple years later, some parent complained and it was no longer offered. People who are afraid of guns should want the people who use them to be more educated, but instead they just want to ban them.  EDIT: People who are educated about gun safety and who take it seriously will make safe decisions whether there are designated ranges or not."

Edit:   This is why I don't go to Rampart Range. Too many idiots, gangbangers and yahoos with no range discipline      Exactly why I haven't been back there in years This was just a matter of time.

I didn't care either way, but I thought it was something I should have a stance on since it's such a hot-button issue. So, I found this guy on Reddit that taught gun safety and he took me out to a shooting range with his friends.  These men had incredible respect for their weapons - they wouldn't even let me touch a firearm until I could repeat those four rules by heart back to them. If we had more of those gun owners, the world would be a better place.  Unfortunately, we have a bunch of drunk fucking morons shouting 'MURICA and accidentally shooting people in the forest."

I was shooting 22 rounds this weekend up near Rustic and I hiked about half a mile behind the back stop/hill I was shooting in to to make sure no one was in the area before shooting.  People don't understand that Colorado isn't as sparse as it once was in the back country, especially on holiday weekends.  ALWAYS check the area behind your targets and make sure you have a proper dirt/organic material backstop that isn't a rock face."

You're just lucky you don't hit people, and failure to admit that is what makes these tragedies happen.  Sorry, I don't know you and any other ""responsible"" gun owners to know that you're never going to get drunk and shoot, or you're going to check your surroundings so thoroughly every single time.  I didn't know random shooting was allowed everywhere and at all times on BLM lands, but thanks for the tip - I'll avoid them from here on out.  Not worth the risk.    Just because nothing is stopping you doesn't make it OK.

My family always said, ""scout the land, have a backstop, and aim down"" when target shooting in these areas, as you will never know who is out there. This is in addendum to wearing those classic bright colors.  I love my booze and green and all that, but if I am going to handle a firearm I'll be sure as hell to avoid those things before hand.

Counter: Somebody (a parent, child, teacher, etc.) is dead because ""irresponsible"" gun owners exist, which we can't change, and they have these freedoms, which we can change if anyone had moral courage.  Step Two: Claim that blindly trusting ""good"" gun owners to shoot ""safely"" makes it impossible for accidents to happen, so therefore you must continue to allow unrestricted gun use whenever and wherever you feel like it.  Counter: Due to our weak gun sale laws and regulations, anyone can obtain a gun and shoot it anywhere they want, without getting any sort of training.  Step Three: But have you even shot a gun?  If you haven't shot a gun, then you're ignorant about them and you don't get to say what we can do with them!

I wish I could of said something but what do you say to a guy with a gun at that point? I fucking hate people like them.   Don't approach them, don't take a cell phone picture, don't do anything that might antagonize them. You call the Park Service so they send a ranger out. Rangers have power to ticket, arrest, call for backup, etc. You don't. If the person in question has been drinking/smoking, or is one of those people that shouldn't own a gun, there's nothing stopping them from pointing it your way and then you'll be in the paper too... and not in a good way."

I wish it was that easy to just call a ranger, but cell phone service is so spotty up there. Especially off Dekkan since it's so deep in. Even so I can count on two hands the amount of times I've actually seen forest service/park rangers up there in the past 7 years. And most of those times was when they were closing off Radio Head parking and telling people they can't park there anymore and giving people warnings at the end of last season."

Alright, can somebody clarify this for me:  If there's a ""No Recreational Shooting"" sign and somebody ignores it and shoots anyway, killing somebody, then it's just an ""irresponsible"" gun owner and the answer is to create more places to shoot guns, put up signs saying it's OK, and trusting the ""good"" people to follow rules.  But if there's a ""Gun-Free School Zone"" sign, then that indicates to crazy people to come shoot up schools, so the answer is to remove the signs and arm teachers/students.  Somebody might be so bold as to suggest that the responsibility/sign ""debate"" is just a distraction from the fact that the excess of guns and gun culture are the problem, whether in the hands of ""good"" people or not."

There has not been an organized movement to force clergy to perform any kind of marriage they don't want, whether it be gay marriage, interracial marriage or interfaith marriage.  The SCOTUS opinion on gay marriage made it clear that ruling does not compel a clergy member to perform a gay wedding.    Mostly this has been fear mongering from the hard right of what could happen eventually without any evidence that it would happen.  Someone may someday try to sue a church that refuses to perform a same sex wedding, but the won't get very far.

Marriage is now just a fancy church service you can go have if you want to. However, in order to have all the legal stuff like the tax breaks and the rights and responsibilities you have to have a Civil Union which is now the legal and official way two couples can share a life together. If the religious folks want to claim the word marriage so bad, let them have it. Just strip it down to the useless word it is first.   OR instead of calling it ""gay marriage"" maybe the religious folks should be told that they do not have a monopoly on the term marriage and if they want to feel pious and special they should define their union as ""Christian Marriage"" or ""Hetero-marriage"" or ""Sanctimonious-asshole-marriage"" or whatever just so they know that their marriage is different and special in the eyes of whatever God gives a shit. Of course their priest or minister better be checking in to make sure they are following all the religious rules associated with their religious marriage or they lose the right to call it that and they are stuck with a regular marriage just like all those atheists and homos.

I mean, it's never really completely safe to land a helicopter on a highway, but someone is going to die if someone doesn't do it. Sometimes it takes a few lives being put at risk to save one. Hard not to have an enormous amount of respect for these guys, and the search and rescue guys, and EMTs, and just anyone like that."

I advise you check it out, and let them know you feel something inappropriate occured. Link:  http://www.tsa.gov/contact-us  If they took him to the private screening room, there are no cameras. In a case like that they will ask all TSA employees to write statements and do their best to figure out the truth. Unfortunately, if this is a first-time incident and appears isolated, you and your father may be a long time in receiving proper 'justice'.   I've seen many passengers too afraid to contact the hotline when they feel something isn't right. Reasons such as they fear they'll end up on a special 'frisk list'. Never seen a list like that. I'd advise contacting TSA, at least as one of your measures for resolution. Another thing you can consider is getting an attorney.

Sure, another possible black eye for TSA, but resolution won't come quicker just because the media is involved. Lawyers work better magic.   All the media will  (and can) do is interview OP and/or OP's dad. Then they use the edited video footage to help paint a dramatic picture of events, and ""leave it up to the viewer"" to decide what really happened -- after they heavily imply the ""obvious"". Then TSA will release the full, unedited video along with a statement that the matter is being investigated OR no wrongdoing was found to have occurred. Depends how quickly people cooperate and what the truth/""truth"" is. Thing is, none of this will make TSA go away. These stories are routine media stories.

When I lived in NYC, the 4th was horrible for my dog who retreated to a closet.  Did you consider a mild sedative?  A little otc benadryl could probably calm your dog.  My vet used to have me use that for air travel, before the revised thinking was not to sedate them for travel.  Check with your vet for dosing or an alternative -- it can just be a little something to take the edge off :)  Or, you could even just keep it on hand in case there is stress."

Colorado,3bxp7n,daydreams356,3,Fri Jul 3 01:58:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely just do the sedative and jacket. Put him in a room if need be. You should look into desensitizing him to sounds like that during the rest of the year... being scared during thunderstorms and such is pretty stressful! Here is an article of how to do that.  While dogs are obviously different, I use a similar techniques on horses to great effect and have had success with dogs as well. Bring in a scary sound/object. You bring it as close as possible without a meltdown but just slight uncomfortable. Its important to have it as far away (or quiet) as needed to allow them to relax and not get too worked up. You continue the pressure of the object/sound until there is a slight relaxation and immediately release (stop and remove) the pressure and reward. You start slow and set them up for success. Continue increasing the pressure slowly with pressure releases during relaxation and you will have a calmer dog. For your dog, maybe a pup gun sound or basketball 30 feet away to start? You can do this with a lot of different objects to build confidence."

Cook until dark brown to black and rotate.  Lather rinse and repeat.  Let cool and peel and cut to constancy you like.  Meanwhile start water boiling in large pot and put in shoulder roast, onions and garlic some salt and pepper.  Boil to you liking, some like shredded and some like diced pork, remove and let cool.

Melt butter and place in flour, cook until brown add some fluid from boiling pot ,to help with clumps, and add mixture to pot.  Cook until you ca taste the chilies.  Add salt and pepper as needed.   This is how my family has made it for decades and we love it.  We never really measure just mix and taste however,  this is approximately how much of each ingredient use.  The more green chilies the better.  We use a mixture of Anaheims and New Mexicos to get flavor and heat.  Some people like dark roux some like light.  It's really subjective.

The chile they use is definitely the New Mexico green chile of the Big Jim/Joe E Parker variety typically grown around Hatch and Las Cruces. You don't usually have much luck getting it freshly roasted unless you're fairly near to New Mexico, but you can typically find it in frozen/canned form in many US grocery stores. I've forgotten the brand name, but it's clearly labeled as from New Mexico. Poblanos are a subsitute. /r/NewMexico may be a better place to ask for green chile recipes though, Durango's not nearly as big into green chile as New Mexico towns are.  Edit: If you happen to live in Colorado, a few King Soopers/City Market stores will carry the Durango Diner green chile salsa.

EDIT: And if they found a way to put nitro booze in a bottle, then they should patent the vessel or process. By patenting the name because of the bottle they would be effectively shutting off any other brewery from putting nitro in a bottle. It was a total dick move by Left Hand. The market is the place for competition, not government protectionism, and Left Hand was looking to use the government to corner the nitro market."

As for sand in everything, it's all up to you. If you take precautions and plan well with clothing and exiting/entering the tent, you can keep the sand to a minimum.

Colorado,3bir77,dancingmanatee,11,Mon Jun 29 19:14:36 2015 UTC,Fracking can be done without injecting wastewater into the ground. And wastewater can be injected into the ground in a manner that doesn't have these effects. The linked page even mentions one in Colorado that changed their procedure and there haven't been any issues since.
Colorado,3bir77,TywinsChamberpot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:01:48 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, wastewater injection is used because it is the most economical diaposal method. Not recycling. And the water they use is not the saline water pulled out of the same aquifers they're injecting into. It's fresh surface non-tributary fresh aquifer water. This is unacceptable. The fraking industry must be held accountable to balance out their water usage rather than removing fresh water from the water cycle."
Colorado,3bir77,dancingmanatee,3,Mon Jun 29 22:06:34 2015 UTC,"Most of the waste water is highly saline formation water. Only a very small portion is actually flowback of injected water.   The fraking industry must be held accountable to balance out their water usage rather than removing fresh water from the water cycle   What would you suggest, beyond paying higher rates than other users? Genuinely curious what a preferable solution would be."
Colorado,3bir77,TywinsChamberpot,2,Mon Jun 29 22:15:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not qualified to offer any solutions. I'm not in the industry nor politics or public policy. My fiance is in the water management group for one of the big fraking companies in town. Before that, he was designing water treatment facilities for mining companies. I talked to him for two hours last night and, based on his limited knowledge, the state is already doing their best in balancing environmental and economical concerns.  One solution we did discuss was to move from gel fracking to slip fracking. Slip fracking uses more water but half of it can be saline. Gel frack must use all fresh water. Slip frack water is easier to recycle because there aren't as many chemicals as a gel frack He also talked about how 40% of water is lost to the formation during a frack, but I'm not sure if that's for both techniques or just the gel technique.   Ignore the argument against fossil fuels and the environmental argument. My biggest gripe is that Colorado is such a water sensitive state. Let's look at this from an economics perspective. Water is a commodity. One that, right now, is less monetarily valuable, but in the greater scheme of things is the most valuable commodity in the world.   In drought years, those aquifers are extremely important. As our population increases our need for water increases. Then add in the fact we don't really know what will happen to our state with climate change, but we should assume a worst case scenario, and that our water resources will become severely strained. No look at what's happened to California. For years, industry has been pulling from their aquifers and now they're in a really, really bad spot.  Right now, we're allowing O&G companies to pull from our fresh water aquifers. Those aquifers should be our ""Oh shit"" savings because we KNOW how valuable it will be in the future. What happens when those aquifers go dry? For Colorado, it's not an if. It's a when. We have to start importing water from out of state or invest in expensive facilities to desalinate our saline aquifers or severely restrict industry's water usage. What will that do to our economy?  We can't stop the global demand for fossil fuels and the boon to our economy allows us to better invest in green technologies. But look into the next 50 years for Colorado. Our water needs to be safeguarded even if that means our economy doesn't grow as much as it would have."
Colorado,3bir77,eta_carinae_311,2,Tue Jun 30 20:13:21 2015 UTC,"If you're interested, you might want to take a look at the State Water Departments assessment of frackings impact on our water supply. My understanding is that most of the water is sourced from cities who have excess surface water, but I haven't seen actual numbers supporting this.   I'd be very curious to see how much water is actually being taken from aquifers in the state by oil and gas companies."
Colorado,3bir77,dancingmanatee,3,Tue Jun 30 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"I think you're right that the O&G companies are getting their water by buying it from senior water rights holders. There's a guy from California... UC Berkley, maybe? He's just put out a book about the asinine water laws in the western US and how poor resource management has caused many of the issues we face today. Basically they allocated each state's amount based on what they thought was the annual flow in the Colorado River, which turned out to be wrong. It's never been corrected and so more water is being used than can be sustained. And it's a use-it-or-lose-it policy, so it's in the senior rights holders interest to overuse when they don't really need to so they can maintain their allotment for leaner years.  A bit of a digression but I think the argument that freshwater is essentially being lost in fracking is a valid one and deserves some consideration, at least. It seems like it would be more effective to revise existing water law but that is one nightmare of a mess to sort out for sure.  I just heard this story on CPR like last week. I'll see if I can find a link to it.  edit: here it is! I guess it's not a book it's an investigative journalism piece from Pro Publica. The journalist's name is Abrahm Lustgarten"
Colorado,3bir77,TywinsChamberpot,2,Tue Jun 30 21:09:17 2015 UTC,"I would too. My fiance believes the government sets restrictions on how much can be taken out of the aquifers. Doesn't know numbers though. He also said all their water comes from ""non-tributary sources"". That's important because that water flows downstream and we make agreements with other states on how much water we can use and how much we have to share.  I skimmed the PDF you sent. I didn't see anything about tributary vs non-tributary. FH might be mistaken. It would make sense if some fracking water came from CO's share of tributary water. Perhaps the minority of water comes from tributary while the majority comes from non-tributary.  I'd also be interested in seeing what the water loss numbers are for fracking. Snowmaking, recreation, and agriculture should, hypothetically, return all water back to the water cycle. I don't know enough about other extraction industries like coal or uranium to say if or how much water is being ""lost"". FH designed a water treatment facility for a uranium mine in Canada because the company anticipated stricter regulations. They had to return their water back to the rivers at pretty much drinking quality. And this was in a region of Canada that is not water sensitive and has an extremely low population density."

Colorado,3bir77,OscarZetaAcosta,0,Tue Jun 30 17:39:21 2015 UTC,"I think you've confused the water that's causing the earthquakes with the freshwater from the surface that's used in the fracking fluids. That is a tiny tiny fraction of the produced water that has to be disposed of. When oil and gas are pumped out of the ground a very large percentage of what actually comes out is water, not oil or gas.  This is naturally occurring water from the formation, and it's highly saline and can often contain radioactive components, depending on the formation that it came from. Sometimes this water can be treated and re-used but the vast majority of it is just disposed of via injection wells.  So yes, hydraulic fracturing does use some surface water, but that's not what's causing the problem with the earthquakes."

Colorado,3bir77,chamaelleon,-2,Tue Jun 30 03:21:26 2015 UTC,"Fracking can be done without injecting wastewater into the ground.   But it isn't, here in the US.  (And in Russia).   Fracking a ""well"" turns millions of gallons of clean water into profoundly contaminated water that's too toxic to dump, and too expensive to clean.   It's vastly cheaper to pump the millions of gallons of fracking-contaminated water into injection wells, and it's somehow still legal to do so.  You cannot ""frack"" without creating millions of gallons of toxic wastewater per site.  Without dumping the fracking wastewater into environmentally destructive injection wells, fracking would not have been cost-competitive enough to have created the ""boom""  that seems to be leading to earthquakes, contaminated water supplies, and the occasional Texas toxic fountains erupting near fracking sites."

It's becoming an issue now because fracking has made previously inaccessible deposits accessible. I think it's fair to say there's more wastewater injection now because hydraulic fracturing has made previously inaccessible deposits economically feasible, but it misses the point to just blame fracking on it's own.  Honestly, if somebody could come up with a cost-effective way to treat produced water that rendered re-injection wells obsolete, I think they could make a ton of money and do some really beneficial stuff for the environment.  *edit - and for anybody who just knee-jerk reacts to things without thinking critically about it (never happens on reddit, right?) consider what exactly it is you want to solve here. You want to stop the earthquakes? Banning fracking isn't going to do it. You have to find an alternative for the produced water that's coming from wells that are ALREADY producing.

The rule of thumb is plan to be back below treeline at noon, but the weather on these mountains is predictably unpredictable. I've had to run to treeline well before noon before, it's just part of hiking the big mountains.  I was on Bierstadt the day before the strike. It was my first time doing Bierstadt on a weekend day, and I was pretty shocked by what I saw. People in booty shorts, cotton shirts, no packs, no water, no layers... and not just a couple, literally hundreds of ill-prepared people strolling along above treeline without a care in the world.

Colorado,3beqel,WPKage,2,Wed Jul 1 03:32:30 2015 UTC,"The largest study of its kind has unexpectedly concluded that smoking marijuana, even regularly and heavily, does not lead to lung cancer.  The new findings ""were against our expectations,"" said Donald Tashkin of the University of California at Los Angeles, a pulmonologist who has studied marijuana for 30 years.  ""We hypothesized that there would be a positive association between marijuana use and lung cancer, and that the association would be more positive with heavier use,"" he said. ""What we found instead was no association at all, and even a suggestion of some protective effect.""  Tashkin's study, funded by the National Institutes of Health's National Institute on Drug Abuse, involved 1,200 people in Los Angeles who had lung, neck or head cancer and an additional 1,040 people without cancer matched by age, sex and neighborhood.  They were all asked about their lifetime use of marijuana, tobacco and alcohol. The heaviest marijuana smokers had lighted up more than 22,000 times, while moderately heavy usage was defined as smoking 11,000 to 22,000 marijuana cigarettes. Tashkin found that even the very heavy marijuana smokers showed no increased incidence of the three cancers studied.  Source"

Colorado,3beqel,Zensayshun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:26:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think the MMED is discouraging flower.  I'm a master grower at a dispensary and I haven't received any information from the MMED that suggests we should switch to tinctures or other products that don't produce smoke.   I also think that the dispensary that posted the document should do a little more research, as that simple summary does not accurately convey the differences:    Smoke from tobacco and cannabis contains many of the same carcinogens and tumor promoters [20,21]. However, cannabis and tobacco have additional pharmacological activities, both receptor-dependent and independent, that result in different biological endpoints. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in smoke are pro-carcinogens that are converted to carcinogens by the enzymatic activity of the cytochrome P4501A1 oxidase protein (CYP1A1 gene product). Benzo [a] pyrene is converted to its carcinogenic metabolite diol epoxide, which binds to specific hyper-mutable nucleotide sequences in the K-ras oncogene and p53 tumor suppressor [22]. Recent work by Roth et al. demonstrates that THC treatment of murine hepatoma cells caused a dose dependent increase in CYP1A1 gene transcription, while at the same time directly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of the gene product [23]. Thus, despite potentially higher levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in cannabis smoke compared to tobacco smoke (dependent on what part of the plant is smoked), the THC present in cannabis smoke should exert a protective effect against pro-carcinogens that require activation. In contrast, nicotine activates some CYP1A1 activities, thus potentially increasing the carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke [24].    Source"

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

That's a 2007 study done by Douglas County which found that merely 3% of rainwater returns to streams/the ground.  Or as little as 0% in dry years.  EDIT: The video tho is a great explanation of water rights in general and why we've got states suing us for more than weed."

Our congress isn't allowed to initially discuss something and vote upon it in the same day, so the bill immediately died.    Unfortunately, in years past sentiment hasn't been in such favor.  That study is brand new and really challenged everyone's assumptions about rainwater.  Watershed return dips down to 0% on drought years, the years we're generally most interested in rainwater collection.  But that's just so contrary to everyone's assumptions."

Colorado,3b9j74,Gerbilsinmyanus,14,Sat Jun 27 02:18:39 2015 UTC,Except it's not exactly correct.  You can have a rain barrel because the law is never enforced on small-scale Home collection. As Deviatednorm pointed out the law against rainwater collection is based on a flawed assumption about what happens to rainwater after it falls.   If I collect 100 gallons of rainwater from my property I have prevented about 3 gallons from entering waterways. However that is 100 gallons I'm not going to draw from my tap which comes from those same waterways. I have actually saved the municipal water system 97 gallons.

Colorado,3b9j74,amateur_mistake,3,Sun Jun 28 03:04:41 2015 UTC,"I assume you were being funny.  But, in context, we are discussing the fact that, according to this, 97% of rainwater evaporates before entering a stream or becoming groundwater."
Colorado,3b9j74,AustenP405,5,Sun Jun 28 12:37:17 2015 UTC,It does a good job of showing the outdated thinking behind the law.  But the notion that it's fundamentally different to allow my roof borne rain water to drain into the gutter and out onto one spot on the lawn than it is to allow me to collect that in a barrel and spread it all over the lawn is inherently ridiculous.
Colorado,3b9j74,angry_wombat,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:15:46 2015 UTC,"I was wondering about this very thing, earlier.      Colorado law says it's illegal to divert rainwater from its final destination. If I were to collect it and then use it to water my plants, nothing is being prevented from reaching my lawn, the very place it would have gone without a rain barrel.       Further, if I had a hypothetical gutter system over the top of my lawn with drainage holes spaced out evenly to water my lawn, the lawn would be the water's final destination and it would be completely legal. Therefore, the diversion and redistribution of water isn't the issue at hand, just how long it's held, which isn't addressed at all in the current laws.      Edit: Formatting"
Colorado,3b65ou,NtheLegend,32,Fri Jun 26 07:54:48 2015 UTC,"Colorado Springs doesn't get marijuana sales tax revenue because the city council voted to not allow marijuana sales inside the city limits. Other parts of El Paso county do allow the sale of marijuana (Manitou Springs for instance) and they do collect sales taxes as a result.  Even if Colorado Springs did allow the sale of marijuana though, the amount of revenue needed to fix the roads is huge. I doubt the taxes raised that way would be much more then enough to pave a couple miles of city streets. Road resurfacing costs between $200k and $1m per mile depending on the technique used and type or road. Colorado springs has 5636 lane-miles of road. Even if every penny of taxes and fees collected by the entire state went to fixing roads it probably wouldn't be enough to do much more than get started.  What's really needed to fix the roads (and other infrastructure) around town is a significant increase in property taxes. Of course, such a suggestion can go nowhere in this county."

They made so much in 2014 that they collected $30M more than the 1992 Taxpayer Bill of Rights allows, and is now being forced to decide whether to repeal that amendment so they can use it for state expenditures, or pay every CO adult a refund of $7.63.

More supply than demand, the lower the price.    Colorado suppliers are still sorting out their crop system, to meet the demands. Also in the mix is transportation of said product. Many commercial transportation companies cannot legally (by Federal law) transport MJ. So they either have to transport it themselves, adding to costs, or contract to a Colorado only transport, which could also affect costs.   So, we go back to the Supply vs Demand issue. Even if there is more than adequate supply, if transportation becomes an issue, if the supply at the Point of Sale is lower than the Demand for the product, the price will rise. Reverse this, and prices drop.  Colorado is still sorting out these problems. I expect prices to fluctuate up and down for a few more years before they stabilize."

Once in Hawaii I was spit at from a car while walking down the road, probably because I'm a haole. But point is - assholes are ubiquitous. Colorado is not immune. However, one thing that disappoints me about people pretty much everywhere, is every time I camp in the national forest I'm cleaning up some other asshole's broken glass, cans, and cigarette butts. Just went camping the other day and someone didn't even care to bury their TP. Just let it blow all over the forest. This type of behavior from anyone disgusts me.

Colorado,3aquct,trouty,12,Mon Jun 22 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"I'm volunteering for a third time, let me see what I can answer.   It's my understanding that upper parking lot access is open from 3am-7am, and you can't leave the mountain until the race ends between 3pm-sunset depending on circumstances.   3pm is optimistic at best. I've heard people get out as late as 10pm, in past years with lots of crashes and bad weather. Expect to get down between 6-8pm.   To optimize spectating position-to-crippling-exhaustion ratio, what's the latest I could be at the foot of the mountain and still be able to park my motorcycle at one of the 2-3 highest parking lots (glen cove/devils playground/etc)?   I would recommend being there as early as possible. 1am would be pretty good. Camping passes are optimal, but since you're not driving up, I'd imagine that limits the amount of gear you can carry. The latest you can manage is probably 3am. I would not recommend getting stuck in traffic.   Anything else to consider from those who have attended in the past?   Lots. Here's a checklist of things to bring on race day:   Sunscreen, maximum SPF (don't fuck your body up from the intense UV. I got second degree burns my first time.) Sunglasses (see above) Cold weather wear (conditions on the mountain change rapidly and drastically) Warm weather wear (see above) A goddamn lot of water. Even if you're a well-acclimated Colorado native, the altitude will take its toll on you. If you're from out of state, it's doubly important. Do not drink or take recreational marijuana up there. It'll be dangerous coming down the hill if you're intoxicated, and altitude sickness will already be taking its toll. Calorie-dense food.   Dunno if you can pack all that. You'll definitely need a backpack (or more) to carry all the stuff you need for a day at altitude."

Colorado,3aquct,CookieMan0,9,Tue Jun 23 00:59:55 2015 UTC,"It's looking like I'll be camping up on glen cove Friday night   Actually, I think camping on the mountain is only possible one day of the year: the night prior to the hill climb. Try double-checking with the event organizers, just in case I'm wrong.  I forgot to mention, you may consider bringing chapstick too.  And I'm actually assigned to Glen Cove this year!

Colorado,3aquct,adamXYL,8,Tue Jun 23 01:05:00 2015 UTC,It's best to get a camping pass and go up the night before. Bring ear plugs. We take 4-6 bikes every year and buy one camping pass.
Colorado,3aquct,MrBlaaaaah,3,Mon Jun 22 22:07:11 2015 UTC,"It seems a bit different than the last time I went, but I would get there early. Like 4am at the latest, if it were me. Viewing locations are very limited and I can't give you a real ""here's the latest you can get there.""

Colorado,3aquct,R4PTUR3,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:07:23 2015 UTC,"I've spectated the past eight years, and I've usually camped, but even then, if you want optimum spectating spots, you must wake up at 4 AM to drive up to Devils Playground. The last couple years, we've also found that lining up at the entrance works fine too. We arrive at the entrance of the highway at like 7 PM Saturday, hang out and drink until 4 AM when they open the highway and drive up from there. Also keep in mind that the better spot you get, the longer you'll be on the mountain, at least at Devils Playground.

As of what they did last year I will never go again, and that is considering I live just south. I was at the picnic area, where they had 8 foot tall fences, so you couldn't even watch the race let alone take pictures. I felt so horrible for many groups of people who came to watch. It was like we were nothing more than cattle that paid for this experience. Honestly if you must come watch, come later and walk up to the start line, at least you can see and leave early. I have watched the race from all the areas over the years. VIP with chevy and got to fly to the top in a heli as a kid. But this race has died for spectators. Also I am only blaming part of that on the race, a good amount of it, is the stupid women who crossed the road when she was told not to, and screwed the rest of us."

Colorado,3aquct,CookieMan0,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:57:09 2015 UTC,"It wasn't one spectator's fault. I know of at least two collisions caused by spectators, and another that nearly caused an accident. A privateer's custom-built Porsche 914-6 was trashed in 2013 because of some idiot fucking spectator who thought a smartphone video was more important than the safety of a driver.  The organizers didn't have a choice when it came to enforcing stricter rules. Their insurers/backers gave them three options:  1) Corral spectators into safe areas from which to watch. Don't allow people outside these areas on race day, until the race is over.  2) Make it a private event. No spectators, and reduced volunteering requirement.  3) Stop holding the race.  Which would you have picked? The first? I thought so. That's what the organizers picked. There were no other options."

Colorado,3aq9z1,DogHereCanConfirm,18,Mon Jun 22 17:07:48 2015 UTC,"In my experience, summer skiing is only enjoyable for the novelty of being able to say that you skied in the summer. Sure, you can post some pictures on fb and impress your friends and family who will think that you're super extreme and crazy, but the ride will probably suck and the hike with all of that gear on your back definitely will suck. The ""snow"" is likely to be very hard and bumpy early in the day, and if you're lucky it will be soft and slushy later in the afternoon. Coverage is probably good enough for that right now."
Colorado,3aq9z1,rygnar,12,Mon Jun 22 19:43:47 2015 UTC,"I was there yesterday. The 'glacier' is definitely in summer mode, meaning it's melted out along the sides and bottom. My hike up it at 5:30am required crampons, but by the time I hit it on the way back it was packed ice with about 6-8"" of slurpee-style ice granules on top. It's wet and sloppy and made for a gross glissade down the 'headwall'.   You're seriously going to get 300 yards of something resembling skiing then you'd better stop quickly or you'll be p-texing the free engraving the bottom of your skiis that the rocky runout at the bottom gives you before you hit the lake.   Not gonna say your plans are dumb (I get up at 2am on my day off to carry heavy shit on mountains...

Following the necessary federal and state  government permits, in 1993 another Australian native, a tiny parasitic  wasp (Avetianella longoi) the size of a grain of pepper, was let  loose to combat the borer. It was a spectacular success. Laying its eggs inside those of the borer—so instead of a borer grub emerging a wasp  does—the million tiny wasps Paine estimates his lab produced for release throughout California cut borer populations dramatically, which had by  this time spread across the state. “Populations of that borer are so low it is really hard to find now,” he advises.""  http://failuremag.com/feature/article/californias_bioterror_mystery/#ixzz3dXtyjERk"

Many Dayak vil- lagers had malaria, and the World Health Organization had a solution that was simple and direct. Spraying DDT seemed to work: Mosquitoes died, and malaria declined. But then an expanding web of side effects (“consequences you didn’t think of,” quips biologist Garrett Hardin, “the existence of which you will deny as long as possible”) started to appear. The roofs of people’s houses began to collapse, because the DDT had also killed tiny parasitic wasps that had previously controlled thatch-eating caterpillars. The colonial government issued sheet-metal replacement roofs, but people couldn’t sleep when tropical rains turned the tin roofs into drums. Meanwhile, the DDT-poisoned bugs were being eaten by geckoes, which were eaten by cats. The DDT invisibly built up in the food chain and began to kill the cats. Without the cats, the rats multiplied. The World Health Organization, threatened by potential outbreaks of typhus and sylvatic plague, which it had itself created, was obliged to parachute fourteen thousand live cats into Bor- neo. Thus occurred Operation Cat Drop, one of the odder missions of the British Royal Air Force.  http://www.natcap.org/images/other/NCchapter14.pdf"

Water level depends on snow fall, so the jumps could be bigger than usual..."
Colorado,3adrzz,devlar_ynwa,15,Fri Jun 19 08:41:09 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go into a lot of detail because I'm pretty familiar with the area.  You'll jump from here:  GPS: 39.878494, -106.327706  There is a campground very near there called Elliot Creek Campground, here: 39.874896, -106.324477  The water level fluctuates hugely (like a 40' difference between lowest and highest) because it's a storage reservoir, it's lowest during Winter, typically peaks around the end of June, and starts declining again in early August - but some years it never gets very high (like 2012).  You can check the level with up-to-the-hour data HERE..  As you can see, it's currently very full.  If you scroll down, you can look at historical water level data for every day/month/year all the way back to 1946.  For a helpful understanding of the water levels and what they mean, I'll include a couple of videos from times I went with their corresponding water levels that day.  7/26/12 - 96,711 acre-feet  8/29/12 - 83,339 acre-feet  7/22/14 - 151,736 acre-feet  It's currently at 145,706 acre-feet so it'll be much more like that 3rd video than the first two.  One more thing to note, water temps..  It is cold as hell, but don't expect it to get much warmer.  The warmest it ever gets is the low 50s, but if you're concerned about the current conditions, you can make a free account at ""FishExplorer"" and see the most currently updated water temperature at this link: http://www.fishexplorer.com/co/lakedet.asp?lid=2120  Let me know if you have any questions!

Dish was well within their rights to terminate him for using a federally prohibited substance. He knowingly took that risk, and then decided to litigate when he failed a drug test. A test which he agreed to submit to when he entered the employ of the company and knew that the results of said test could be used as valid grounds for firing. I'm all for allowing people safe access to the medicine they need without any attached taboo but taking Dish to court is not the way to do that, status quo says Dish is in the right. He should be using his story to advocate for policy reform."
Colorado,3a9sde,bear_town,9,Thu Jun 18 18:50:12 2015 UTC,Yea but i could also see this as being a catalyst for change. Now that the precedent has been established we can legislate an exception etc.   Sometimes things have to go to court so we know where the current law stands.

Colorado,3a9sde,chili420indenver,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:55:56 2015 UTC,"DISH's policy is the way it is for right now because they have employees all over the country and don't want to allow marijuana use (even off the clock, even medicinal) for some employees but not others. They realize that changes are occurring across the country and many states are legalizing marijuana for medicinal and legal use and they are open to eventually changing their policies to match laws and common sense. They just don't want to have patchwork rules for different locations. I think once there is enough of a tide of other states seeing that nothing bad has happened in the states that allow medicinal/recreational marijuana, large nationwide companies will start changing those policies. In the meantime, I figure Coates probably pursued this case to try to see if DISH would change its policy or he could get a precedent set for protections for medical users - in my opinion, that's a worthwhile goal. But he chose to work for an employer with this drug policy and knew he would be occasionally tested and then fired. There are probably some smaller local companies that don't drug test that you can work for as an after-work medical marijuana user."

Federal tax fraud is the clearest example -- there's no statewide laws that say it's illegal to violate these Federal tax laws, we only care about our state taxes.

Colorado,3a9sde,ModernRonin,5,Thu Jun 18 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"But that is not how the court ruled.  From the ruling (which can be found here).  The issue is that the statute in question (24-34-402.5) is too vague in it's definition of 'lawful'.  As such, the court ruled that 'lawful' refers both state and federal laws in regards to what constitutes 'lawful activities' under the statute.    Because medical use is still illegal under federal law, the court ruled that the statute does not protect the individual from being removed from their job.  Unfortunately, the court is correct as they can only interpret the laws given to them.  In this case blame the feds for keeping medical illegal and the Colorado legislature for giving too vague a definition of what constitutes 'legal activities' under the law."

What a load of BS. The statement of intent in Amendment 64 is plenty clear. Can these people not even read? I'm going to go read the opinion (thanks for posting it, have an upvote).  ...   The term “lawful” as it is used in section 24-34-402.5 is not restricted in any way, and we decline to engraft a state law limitation onto the  term.    Idiots. IT'S NOT THEIR CHOICE! Their purvey encompasses only Colorado law. They can say ""we interpret Federal law to mean X"" but their opinion has no legal standing! The Federal Supreme Court decides questions of Federal law, not them."
Colorado,3a9sde,ModernRonin,2,Thu Jun 18 17:57:31 2015 UTC,"I don't see this as the court interpreting federal law.  Instead they are interpreting what the definition of lawful under the statute as written is.  The court is holding that because the term 'lawful' does not differentiate between lawful at the state level and lawful at the federal level it applies to any law, either at the state or federal level.  It's certainly shitty, and I don't agree with the guy even being fired by Dish, but in my opinion the court is correct given the statute's piss poor wording.  The real kicker is that it would have been fairly easy for the legislature to make the statute apply only to Colorado law.  For what ever reason they did not have the foresight to do so."
Colorado,3a9sde,xdrtb,2,Thu Jun 18 18:26:43 2015 UTC,"I don't see this as the court interpreting federal law.   I do. Basically, they're saying: ""While this is OK under Colorado law, it's illegal under Federal law, therefore it's illegal in Colorado.""  Implicit in that argument is that the Colorado SC gets to say what Federal law is and isn't. And I just don't believe the Colorado SC has the authority to say what Federal law is. They only get to say what Colorado law is.  I'd be fine with them saying: ""This is legal under Colorado law, therefore we find for the Plantiff. But since Colorado law appears to conflict with Federal law, we also expect Respondent to appeal to a Federal court."" (Or file a separate suit in Federal court, whatever.)"
Colorado,3a9sde,ModernRonin,2,Thu Jun 18 18:52:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly we will have to agree to disagree, as my opinion is that the court is not interpreting federal laws but is only interpreting the statute as written applies to federal laws along with state laws.

Colorado,3a9sde,ModernRonin,3,Sat Jun 20 03:41:23 2015 UTC,"No.  Vaccinations are both locally and Federally legal.  The crux of this ruling was Colorado's Off-duty Lawful Activities statute which says it's discrimination/illegal to fire someone for doing legal things in their off-time.  The example you give below of opiates?  Well, those are similarly legal at both the state and Federal level, so it would be illegal to fire for use during off-time.  Use during work would likely fall under ADA provisions."

You're going to have to spend some cash to get to Kentucky, and it will end up being several hundred dollars.  You have a few options: Get someone to drive you.  Odds of this are low and you'd have to pay them for gas at minimum (frankly you should also pay for hotel costs and food). Get a rental car.  La Junta has a Hertz.  This is going to cost you some money.  One way car rentals are expensive, not to mention putting 1800 miles on the car.  You could rent at Hertz in La Junta, then head west to Colorado Springs to rent another car to get a better deal (more competition). Take the bus or plane.  Rent a car and get to Colorado Springs or Denver and take the appropriate mode of transportation.  If you have a lot of stuff, this may not work.    In my opinion, renting a car is your best bet.  It will be costly.  I do feel for you, but at the same time, you should have had money in reserve in case something went wrong.

Auto glass does weird things to bullet paths.  The deflection cone of a bullet shot dead on into glass can be as much as 30 degrees off axis.  Bullets shot at oblique angles <30 degrees into glass can change path either towards normal (into the car) or away from it (out of the car) while still shattering the glass."

Colorado,3a2adu,DevilishDreamer,16,Tue Jun 16 17:49:46 2015 UTC,"Go south!  Everyone tends to go up I-70 and 285, instead of checking out the Sangre de Cristos and San Juan ranges.  The Collegiate Peaks are both enormous and beautiful 14ers, and offer a nice view of the mountains while facing east, instead of west.  The Great Sand Dunes National Monument is down there, and the entire southwest region of the state is just dotted with small towns, instead of larger cities.  It makes for great star-gazing, due to the lack of light pollution. Go for a 3 day trip, and just stay in some of the towns and eat the local food.  Go to Bruce's Bar in Severance (where the geese fly, and the bulls cry), and try out some Rocky Mountain Oysters.  Don't be afraid, they're just like fried chicken strips.  And even if they're nasty, at least you can say that you've eaten them at least once.  Whitewater rafting in the Arkansas River?  I did this, and it's a blast.  Take a hot air balloon or helicopter tour, rent a Jeep, or an ATV for some offroading.   Strawberry Hot Springs?  Maybe take one last ride on the Alpine Slide (sadly, it's closing for good at the end of the summer) in Heritage Square.    Go to the county that existed for only four days.  Have you visited the Royal Gorge since the fire, or been to the Four Corners in awhile?  Take State Highways there, it's worth it, just for the drive.  You could go to Mesa Verde and see all of the Puebloan cave dwellings.  Trains!!.  Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railway, for sure.  You need to take a train ride at least once (even if it's from Union Station to Glenwood Springs).  Go to Grand Junction & the western slope of Colorado for peach season!  Western Slope peaches are the best in the world, and they'll be available early this year, due to the warm spring.  Here are some more autumn vacation ideas for you.  Edited to add links."

The district attorney prosecuting the case wouldn’t comment, but the Pike’s Peak Regional Humane Society seemed to have little sympathy.  “There’s always ways for people to come up with the money to do this,” president Jan McHugh-Smith told CNN.  Yet dog owners across the country are finding themselves in similar situations, facing huge bills over small pet-related violations like a pet getting loose in the neighborhood or a dog barking too much.  Some are even facing arrest when they can’t pay up.  A CNNMoney analysis of arrest warrants from a sampling of 15 cities and counties found thousands of outstanding warrants stemming from offenses like this.  Other owners have had their dogs killed when they couldn’t afford the fines and fees to get them back from animal control.   http://fox13now.com/2015/06/03/doggie-death-penalty-pay-thousands-or-risk-your-pets-lives/"

Even if he shot at us the news headlines going to read cops kill man for shoplifting. Do everything you can before we use lethal.""  Bottom line is he shot at cops. They would be very far within the law to use lethal force against him. This is the result of people complaining that cops shoot too many people, and then thinking its okay to riot about it. Usually because they don't understand the reality of police work. I see it every day at work. People think  just yelling ""Hey you! Stop!"" actually works.

Colorado,39lcp5,LetsGetMotarded,41,Fri Jun 12 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"The governor told lawmakers he would support legislation to limit the cameras to school and construction zones and areas with high traffic and pedestrian accidents. He also supports limiting the use of fine revenue to traffic safety improvements and enforcement.   So we'd see more of the ""This area has been a construction zone for 6 months with no actual work done"" phenomenon.  Also, who defines ""High Traffic""?  Also, using the fines for furthering enforcement kind of creates an incentive for them to go beyond the whole ""Safety"" into the ""We use this for funding"" realm.  Hasn't that been an issue with Asset Forfeiture?  When it becomes a piggy bank for the folks doing the enforcing there is less incentive to be fair and more incentive to ""fill the coffers"".  I liked Hickenlooper when he was mayor.  He's proven as Governor that he's a mini-Bloomberg.  I'm generally pretty liberal, but if he's got any aspirations to national office he isn't the kind of person I'd vote for.

Colorado,39lcp5,Literally_JaclynGlen,3,Fri Jun 12 17:52:48 2015 UTC,I think having beauprez run was the go's way of securing the Senate victory.

Colorado,39lcp5,revanyo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:06:34 2015 UTC,"No matter who they ran, they didn't care if he won.   They were gonna let Kansas go blue so they could keep their 80 year old Neo-con senator in.  All the polls suggested that they would lose the governorship, and all they cared about was the fact they were winning the senate polls.   When I asked them(Senate campaigners in KS) about CO, out of curiosity since I lived there forever and knew people were mad about Hickenlooper. They said all they were concentrating on taking the senate in Colorado, and that some people had been moved there for that. So essentially a ""Fuck you, figure it out yourself"".   They didn't care about winning it and still almost did. As you can tell Gardner had massive funding and Beauprez didn't. That's the reason."
Colorado,39lcp5,Literally_JaclynGlen,2,Fri Jun 12 22:33:40 2015 UTC,"I remember hearing that Pat Roberts problems did not surface until after the GOP primary , and that is why he got the nomination. If his troubles were known earlier he would have faced opposition. That is also why the independent candidate did very well. The Democratic nomination was just in it for the sake of saying that they put up a fight but did not expect to win at all. So when the troubles about Roberts came forward the Dems knew they had a phony running so they pulled out to clear the field for the independent. The GOP did not want the Dems to pull out because they knew the phony would only hurt them."
Colorado,39lcp5,NtheLegend,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:44:04 2015 UTC,"Roberts barely won the primary. His primary was closer than the actual election.  If it had been just a 2 person primary he would've lost it.   The GOP did not want the Dems to pull out because they knew the phony would only hurt them.   Instead they went with the national plan of dumping all resources into the Senate race, it seems to have worked because Roberts and Gardner won. I just don't like that they were gonna leave the states blue for a senate seat.  Hickenlooper especially should've been easy to beat."

And say that our economy hadn't boomed like this - say that the tourist industry hadn't exploded - the return on investment wouldn't be so great. It's comparing apples and oranges. DIA didn't make Colorado a tourist destination, and a better NJ transit system/airport wouldn't do it for them either."

Colorado,39lsba,HSChronic,5,Sat Jun 13 17:18:22 2015 UTC,building the airport way out east accomplished a number of things. denver wanted to keep an airport instead of turning it over to aurora or another suburb. but the city was surrounded by 'burbs. they annexed the land for the airport into the city and county of denver and increased their economic reach and clout considerably. any new housing in the airport area will increase denver's population and increase the city's bargaining capacity when it comes to securing future water resources so aurora doesn't grab all the water.  it's pretty much a low-level fight between denver and aurora.

Colorado,39lsba,rtd131,3,Sat Jun 13 14:11:54 2015 UTC,"it was a bumpy road getting DIA built. this is from a wikipedia entry about the project:   From 1980 to 1983,[28] the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) investigated six areas for a new metro area airport which were north and east of Denver. In September 1989, under the leadership of Denver Mayor Federico Peña (after whom Peña Boulevard is named), federal officials authorized the outlay of the first $60 million for the construction of DIA. Two years later, Mayor Wellington Webb inherited the megaproject, scheduled to open on October 29, 1993.  Delays caused by poor planning and repeated design changes due to changing requirements from United Airlines caused Mayor Webb to push opening day back, first to December 1993, then to March 1994.   By September 1993, delays due to a millwright strike and other events meant opening day was pushed back again, to May 15, 1994. In April 1994, the city invited reporters to observe the first test of the new automated baggage system. Reporters were treated to scenes of clothing and other personal effects scattered beneath the system's tracks, while the actuators that moved luggage from belt to belt would often toss the luggage right off the system instead. The mayor cancelled the planned May 15 opening. The baggage system continued to be a maintenance hassle and was finally terminated in September 2005,[29] with traditional baggage handlers manually handling cargo and passenger luggage.  On September 25, 1994, the airport hosted a fly-in that drew several hundred general aviation aircraft, providing pilots with a unique opportunity to operate in and out of the new airport, and to wander around on foot looking at the ground-side facilities—including the baggage system, which was still under testing. FAA controllers also took advantage of the event to test procedures, and to check for holes in radio coverage as planes taxied around and among the buildings.  DIA finally replaced Stapleton on February 28, 1995, 16 months behind schedule and at a cost of $4.8 billion,[30] nearly $2 billion over budget. The construction employed 11,000 workers.[31] United flight 1062 to Kansas City International Airport was the first to depart and United flight 1474 from Colorado Springs Airport was the first to arrive.[32]  After the airport's runways were completed but before it opened, the airport used the codes (IATA: DVX, ICAO: KDVX). DIA later took over (IATA: DEN, ICAO: KDEN) as its codes from Stapleton when the latter airport closed.  During the blizzard of March 17–19, 2003, heavy snow tore a hole in the terminal's white fabric roof. Over two feet of snow on the paved areas closed the airport (and its main access road, Peña Boulevard) for almost two days. Several thousand people were stranded at DIA.  Another blizzard on December 20 and 21, 2006 dumped over 20 inches (51 cm) of snow in about 24 hours. The airport was closed for more than 45 hours, stranding thousands. Following that blizzard, the airport invested heavily in new snow-removal equipment which has led to a dramatic reduction in runway occupancy times to clear snow, down from an average of 45 minutes in 2006 to just 15 minutes in 2014.   i've heard a few rumors over the years that there was a lot corruption and other shady dealings with the construction contracts.  people from all over the state (me included) flocked to the airport -- even if they weren't flying anywhere -- just to look at the newfangled airport, everybody using the excuse that they'd need to know how to get there when they eventually would travel somewhere. and if i remember correctly, there were problems with the airport trains too, in the first few months after it opened."

And I look at our roads and infrastructure and think that CO has it pretty good.  Our roads are constantly under construction every summer because the winter destroys them (frost heaves, plows, pot holes), signage sucks out here, most homes are on oil or propane heat which incredibly expensive, there's a greater risk of power outages in severe storms because power-lines are all above ground (hard to dig through granite).  It takes longer to drive shorter distances in NE because highway system isn't great.  Food and the cost of living out here is more expensive because local farming can't support NE - so we buy our food from the west.  I totally understand what you're saying about infrastructure - I feel the same way about Maine, but what infrastructure is lacking in CO?  I've seen new housing developments popping up in Denver and Colorado Springs like crazy for the last ten or fifteen years.  Last time I was out there, there were these new LED lights for the lane stripes on I-70 - heading toward Eisenhower Tunnel.  Is the infrastructure better in IL than in CO - or better in Chicago than Denver?  I totally get where you're coming from - I moved out here and thought holy shit, ME needs infrastructure to help boost it's economy!

Colorado,39be4w,neatopat,4,Wed Jun 10 23:12:17 2015 UTC,"The blue color can in part be attributed to it being a long exposure, and there being plenty of ambient light.  That said, the image is definitely post-processed."

There's a bigger market for rec weed, and they've seen people are willing to pay higher prices...so they charge more.  It has jack to do with costs incurred by the business, it's all profit."

So that $65 eighth will now be $63.99  Unless we factor inflation.  In that case, with the tax reduction starting in 2017, that $65 eighth should run you about $69."
Colorado,395x6p,DeviatedNorm,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"A big problem is the limited amount of rec shops, at least outside of Denver I'm guessing. When these shops have no competition, they make their own prices....and it's cheaper to buy it black market."

The worst rec I have seen in my personal opinion was CAM when they were still opened, Denver Rec Dispensary though their prices are more reasonable, their weed is garbage. Natural remedies is usually the worst out of these three. And these are the three most talked about dispensaries in my inner circle, all of which came recommended by friends.   But pretty much every dispensary has more crap commercially produced weed than good, organically grown, chem free, pesticide free, mold free bud. And it seems the vast majority do not have any sort of on site facility at their grows to properly dry weed. It's done on drying racks with fans with zero humidity or temp control."

I don't think you realize just how expensive it is just to keep a single intersection or mile of highway up to code.  And the few areas that are completely privatized are monopolies, like Prisons, Railroads, and oil. Three huge industries that should have more government control, instead they are running by their own rules and stealing money from you and me. The government uses Taxes to pay for all of the nice things you see around you right now. You can pretend that taxes are evil but in reality you just don't grasp how they work and why they exsist."

I didn't say that police or the military should be privated, just that they should be funded voluntarily. Railroads and oil are both defense industries, so they should be privatized but protected from international competition by import/export tariffs.    The government uses Taxes to pay for all of the nice things you see around you right now.   The ends don't justify the means. I'm sorry this is a hard concept for you, but you cannot justify slavery or theft, by any means. It's immoral. I will never support it."

A policy whereby an entire generation are stripped of their wages against their will is slavery. If your argument rests on the idea that taxes are somehow not forcibly expropriated from citizens, you should rethink that. If you think you can somehow justify an immoral act, by any means whatsoever, you should rethink that also."

In return, I don't have to fret about invasions, famine, basic life nessessities.  You get something in return, so it's not theft.   No one fully agrees with the government's actions and stances on things. But it is needed. A ruling body is always needed for a population of people. Governments needs Taxes to exsist.

They can take the data for the same area with the blimp or the cameras and compare it more easily.  Think of it as using the cameras as the baseline.  My thought is that even if it is more effective, the idea will go over like a metal dirigible because I don't think many folks fancy the idea of blimps cluttering up the skyline."

I could see potentially more benefit in the mountains where there are larger gaps between cameras. A blimp with a good lens might be able to see several miles of non-camered road - at least if the weather was decent.   Maybe that's the idea at this intersection too - the blimps could get multiple angles over a lot of road at once."

While, I suffer from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, and I take it for pain, I have nothing but praises about CW.  It's changed my life, and for people with far worse illnesses, it's also changed their lives as well, and that's what matters most.  Before I started taking CW a few months ago, I couldn't sleep at night, even with ambien and other sleep medications, now I can.  In the past, my EDS has affected my digestion, and it has caused me to be in a lot of pain every time I ate, now I am not.  I used to have days upon days of not being able to get out of bed because of the pain.  I used to have times where my legs would collapse out from under me.  These days I am able to get out and do things a lot more.  It even used to take me two days or more to recover from going out and having fun for one day (whether that be a concert, a comic convention, or even just a night at the movies), and now I bounce right back!  That's not to say it's a cure-all for everybody, and I still have to rely on a medicated transdermal patch in conjunction to the CW, but I am no longer taking other painkillers on top of my patch and CW, and I do still have ""bad days"" where I need a single pill of Vicodin to get through the day or to sleep if the pain is too much.  Just the fact that I don't need to take 6-8 Vicodin every day anymore is a miracle!  The funny thing is, I'm not even a pot user at all besides CW.  THC causes me to get migraines.  I never thought I would find solace in marijuana.  I had a chance encounter with a couple of the Stanley Brothers, and I told them my story.  They gave me a bottle to try, and I haven't looked back.  I just really hope more legislators hear stories like this one and my own so they realize how much help and hope medical marijuana can give so many people."

Colorado,38z9ha,g_mo821,12,Mon Jun 8 05:37:14 2015 UTC,"?  You might be reading some wishful thinking into Rand's platform there.  Rand Paul has gone on record as supporting prohibition of marijuana, and tickets, fines,  and financial penalties for using marijuana.  http://www.theamericanconservative.com/rand-paul-learns-to-love-the-drug-war/  “I’m not advocating everyone go out and run around with no clothes on and smoke pot,” he said. “I’m not a libertarian. I’m a libertarian Republican. I’m a constitutional conservative.”  Though to his credit, he does not want minimum jail time applied to its use.  Of course Rand supports a sweeping federal ban on abortion.  Because the whole ""states rights"" schtick only suits him some of the time."
Colorado,38z9ha,smouy,2,Mon Jun 8 18:39:46 2015 UTC,Better than full on not legalizing. Baby steps. I don't think he would try to make it illegal in Colorado after it was already legalized recreationally.  EDIT: Wow guys downvote me because I'm for legalization.

His own state has criminalized it. Encourages Alabama style shenanigans with state-restricted marriage rights.  He opposes civil rights of all types on a federal level because ""states rights to own slaves!""  But best of all, he wants to legislate abortion rights on a federal level, because ... the states rights things really is just bullshit.  He'll find suckers to fund his campaign for sure.

If you allow businesses to fly their flag of racism by repealing civil protections you promote racism.   Civil rights are inalienable but they have to be protected. Allowing business the freedom to be racist is not supporting civil rights. It is the opposite.

I get that they are trying not to create more panic than what has already been created but people are already afraid. They are asking for the public's help with this but they aren't giving us (the public) any information.  I have something very important going on in Fort Collins tomorrow that I'm considering not going to because I'm just too afraid to drive that far north on I-25. I'm not usually one to panic about these types of things but it's just really scary to think about. I hope they catch this person and soon.

Although rhetorical, that is the litmus test, and since each situation is unique, it's not possible to answer that question with certainty.  Life is more important than property, and I think the police were using a strategy intended to subdue the guy and minimize the possibility of deadly harm to everyone including himself.  The problem here is that this property owner has a loss that is not fully covered.  We should look at why this is the case."

Colorado,38nxqd,LetsGetMotarded,7,Fri Jun 5 14:56:47 2015 UTC,"Oh geeze, nothing's that simple with TABOR.  Every year Colorado's budget can only grow by inflation (based on population) plus whatever new tax revenues we vote in.  However, due to a sudden population growth (as well as an increase in goods sold, property built, etc) this year we're generating a lot more taxes than expected (ignoring pot taxes).    And the state is spending this money because they have it.  But if the state starts getting much past the ""this is how much we expected you'd have to spend"" numbers, then TABOR kicks in and says ""whoa hold on now, that's too much -- because you have all this extra money rolling in, clearly you didn't need whatever additional taxes you asked for, so all new taxes need to be refunded.""  It doesn't really matter what the taxes are, what they're earmarked for, etc."
Colorado,38nxqd,DeviatedNorm,-3,Fri Jun 5 16:51:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's a glitch, in that voters have already said they want this money to go for schools and such, but they've got to vote a second time to say the same thing."

Colorado,38nxqd,FailWhale42,7,Fri Jun 5 16:13:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, it would result in a ""tax-holiday"" on recreational marijuana in January 2016 until $13.3 million in tax that would otherwise be collected is used up.   Marijuana cultivators will receive an estimated $19.7 million through excise tax repayments. A tax-free holiday beginning January 2016 will run until $13.3 million in sales taxes have been avoided by those buying marijuana. And finally, those filing state income tax returns will get a share of $25 million returned through a sales tax credit.   Still, I'll be voting for this.  I imagine most recreational pot tax is collected from tourists as anyone who lives in Colorado and smokes on a regular basis probably has the MMJ card and doesn't pay those taxes anyway."
Colorado,38nxqd,RyanSmith,11,Fri Jun 5 13:32:11 2015 UTC,"I work in a dispensary and I would say that Rec sales are majority CO residents. We have customers that purchase three-six times a week and still only shop rec. There's a lot of reasons a person may not get their red card, and many people in the last year have just decided not to renew and keep shopping rec. Obviously a lot of out of towners are shopping as well, but for a lot of people it's just like an occasional trip to the liquor store to stock up."

Colorado,38nxqd,hooorf,3,Fri Jun 5 21:49:24 2015 UTC,An eighth lasts me about 4-6 months with occasional use and about 2-3 months with frequent use. It also helps that I vaporize instead of burning through flowers.  Daily smokers are the ones that buy most. I'd get mocked by people who went through an eighth in days or a week when I told them how long I go between purchases.   For some it's a badge of honor to burn through their cannabis. What matters to me is getting the best effect possible in a way that doesn't make my lungs feel trashed and making the most out of what I buy. I wouldn't feel too great if I was burning $45 per week.

The funny thing is marijuana revenue was actually lower than expected, 60 vs 70 million. The state is framing it as if they have to give back marijuana revenues, when in reality it doesnt matter what pot the money comes from -- they just have to give back the overall excessive revenue. In a sense, this is a loophole for the state too, as voters are more likely to let them keep marijuana money vs ""general revenue"" or ""excess income tax"" etc."

Colorado,38nxqd,tgeliot,2,Fri Jun 5 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"It's ridiculously complicated but there's like 4 levels of refunding.  First they start with new sources of money, but if they still have too much left over they then need to refund other monies.  The next step is a sales tax refund based on your income, then comes an Earned Income Tax Credit, and if they state still has too much money after giving back the sales tax and the tax credit then the state is forced to lower the income tax rate the following year."

The lunch ladies or principals can choose to pay for the student's lunches without recourse.  IMPORTANTLY, there is this thing called 'Free and Reduced Lunches' which provides free or reduced lunches to students who are in poverty. The difference is covered by the government. In this case, the parent failed to provide their child with lunch money even though they presumably can afford it.  The point of refusing to serve lunch is to encourage the student to go home and complain to mom and dad that they need lunch money, otherwise the school doesn't get paid and mom and dad don't care or don't know."

Colorado,38bdj1,GopherGadgets,2,Wed Jun 3 19:39:19 2015 UTC,"This is a false narrative being promoted by someone who took it upon herself to violate school policy based upon her own whim and because the politically correct media jumps on anything that looks as though there is a victim even when there isn't, so this false story has taken on traction that it does not deserve.  All children are provided food during lunch. The majority of children in areas with lower social economic standing are provided a free or reduced lunch with minimal paperwork required at the beginning of the school year. In California, they follow the federal standard which essentially ensures that every child is fed at lunch time. These lunch preparation employees are provided a budget of food on a daily basis depending upon the previous week's demand for school lunches, essentially for anyone that doesn't bring their own lunch. These employees are also held accountable for the balancing of funds versus inventory no different than if it were a restaurant. Their nutrition centers have a specific operating budget that is managed very closely. This budget takes into account all of the free and reduced cost lunches provided. It is very rare that a child comes to school without a lunch or doesn't have sufficient funds in their pre funded account to pay for lunch. Often times those who are required to pay full price or a reduced price for lunch come up short because they squander their lunch funds for snacks, or their parents fail to make the required payments out of a lack of organization and not a lack of financial ability to pay. If they lack the financial ability to pay, their child is provided a free lunch. When a child is faced with not having a free lunch available and also no monies in his normally funded account, the school is required to provide a basic lunch, typically a cheese sandwich and a drink as a stopgap. The parents is then provided with a reminder that their lunch fund needs to be replenished and the parent can then determine if the child is wasting his lunch money on snacks or if the parents simply forgot to fund the account. Remember we are only talking about parents who make sufficient money to fund said accounts, and choose to have their child buy lunch rather than take the time preparing it for them.  This woman simply took it upon herself to give these children a complete lunch from the lunch inventory rather than the stop gap. By doing so the issue that created the shortage of the funds is not addressed, and the accounting and inventory is put out of whack to the detriment of the Nutrition Center, their budget, and essentially negatively impacting the control of funds by the school. This employee does not have the authority to make unilateral decisions about what type of measures to take when there are solutions available to feed a child in this situation. It is completely false that this is being touted as some sort of heroic and charitable act on her part to serve so many poor disadvantaged children that would have gone hungry.

Creek gets hit by budget cuts too, and particularly at the elementary school level one of the more popular solutions has been to merge elementary schools together in order to lower costs. No, they do not have enough in the budget to give out free lunches.  EDIT: also it's not the most upscale area in Denver."

Then I develop the shots accordingly with LRT and light room. For sunrise and sunset use the holy grail workflow and you will get good results. Always always manual for Timelapse

Poor lighting/range contributing to someone mistaking a wolf for a Coyote, or an asshole actively setting out to hunt a species that by-and-large hasn't even been seen in Colorado for a longass time?

No new forests grow because deer have eaten all the saplings.  tl;dr wolves, like most native predators are good for ecosystems."

Colorado,383ijr,autowikibot,3,Mon Jun 1 17:31:30 2015 UTC,"Section 27. North America of article  Swastika:       The swastika motif is found in some traditional Native American art and iconography. Historically, the design has been found in excavations of Mississippian-era sites in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, and on objects associated with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (S.E.C.C.). It is also widely used by a number of southwestern tribes, most notably the Navajo, and plains nations such as the Dakota. Among various tribes, the swastika carries different meanings. To the Hopi it represents the wandering Hopi clan; to the Navajo it is one symbol for the whirling log (tsil no'oli), a sacred image representing a legend that is used in healing rituals.  A brightly colored First Nations saddle featuring swastika designs is on display at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Canada.

Colorado,37zpkj,chamaelleon,-8,Wed Jun 3 02:10:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I've lived in Ventura, California (used to be an awesome cultural mecca, now just an outdoor corporate shopping mall and swarms of cops), I've lived in Detroit (10 Mile off of Woodward Ave, right in the action, and during a superbowl and Kwami Killpatrick's corruption scandal), I've lived in rural Pennsylvania, with big rowdy fairs, rolling green hills, and fluffy snow. All of these places for several years or more.   And now I live in Colorado. And I love it here the best. There are very friendly and welcoming people here, who are informed and active. The buildings are covered with gorgeous, elaborate murals and graffiti (and people don't tag up each other's artwork here). And people aren't sedentary and boringly stupid; they get out and do shit, and they have more than the usual prescribed conversations about sports and cars and what we all did the last time we were drunk.   Plus, the weather is awesome, despite the complaints of whiners who are simply don't prepare themselves for it. It changes rapidly, and the clouds are big and almost more 3-dimensional than anywhere else I've lived, surely in part due to the higher elevation and actually being closer to the weather. The other day, Ping-Pong ball-sized hail peppered the ground for five minutes, and then the sun came out and it was 70 degrees again. It was totally cool. And when it rains, it rarely does so for more than a half hour, if that. So the changes are not day-consuming events that excessively interrupt your plans. Summer is good and long, but there's still a decent winter season for a change (not nearly as long and oppressive as PA and MI winters though).  It's AWESOME here, and I highly recommend Colorado to everyone."

Because it's past the foothills, situated in a sort of valley before the next set of bigger mountains which make up the continental divide.

Still, I don't have a problem, at all, with the school asking him not to come out during his valedictorian speech. It seems selfish and inappropriate to me considering that it's a day for his whole class to celebrate their accomplishments. He's rather selfishly attempting to put the spotlight on himself (which he accomplished by the way.)  Imagine this: a kid becomes valedictorian and uses the speech to propose to their girlfriend/boyfriend. I would think this is inappropriate and selfish. It would be an example of a student making the focus about them rather than the class.   Also, this kid allegedly altered his graduation gown and was asked to change parts of his speech that were disrespectful and mean spirited towards staff and classmates.   The story really doesn't have anything to do with him being gay, it has to do with him being selfish and needing to grow up a little."
Colorado,37sthx,skinsfan55,10,Sat May 30 16:55:28 2015 UTC,If you read more than just the title to this post you will see that this kid was kind of a selfish prick. His sexuality isn't the reason hundreds of family and friends gathered to watch the graduation.
Colorado,37sthx,jgetz1993,3,Sat May 30 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with the speech being pulled, as the commencement is about graduation, the future and the benefits of education.   The kid overstepped what would be considered acceptable material and the school has a right to select what message to send.  However, it was not in rights of the Principal to contact the parents and discuss his opinions on the sexual preference of the student.  That was inappropriate.    He could have left the conversation at ""We had to remove him from the speakers list as the speech he prepared had content unrelated to the activity of commencement.""   And when the parents asked (as they would) what that content was, he should say ""That is something you should review with your son, however it is our decision the speech in it's present form should not be part of the ceremony.  If your son wishes to change his speech, that is acceptable, however if during the course of the speech he begins to bring up the non-commencement related items we reserve the right to have him removed from the podium""  Thing is, the Principal is between a rock and a hard place.

Colorado,37tghm,dksfpensm,2,Mon Jun 1 02:40:15 2015 UTC,"Get the ""gun show"" aspect out of your head, that makes zero difference.  That's a deliberate media-driven misconception.  There's no such thing as a ""gun show loophole"", that's a straight up lie.  Someone who sells more than I think 10 guns a year is considered a dealer, and required to get a FFL license from the ATF.  Part of the stipulations of this license is that they must perform a background check for ALL gun sales.  That's federal law, and does not vary from state to state.  Most the stands at a gun show are setup by dealers.  In that case, it's no different being in that auditorium/convention center as it is being in their storefront.  You might occasionally get an individual that decides to rent a table one time and try to sell off some of their guns, but that's a rarity."
Colorado,37tghm,mesostoney,3,Mon Jun 1 12:16:24 2015 UTC,"So you can't just bring your gun collection to a gun show with the intention of selling them to people you meet who may be interested?

Colorado,37tghm,megman13,3,Sun May 31 01:59:51 2015 UTC,"Gun shows have nothing to do with background checks. At all. If you sell guns as a business you need an FFL and must do a BGC no matter where the transaction occurs. Federally, individuals can sell to each other without one but this can occur at a gun show, parking lot, police station, whatever.

Colorado,37tghm,DamagedHells,18,Sat May 30 17:41:42 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to suggest that guns aren't regulated, or that perpetrators of crimes involving guns aren't punished? Because both of these ideas are false.  Guns are regulated, from background checks to regulations on which kind of guns you can own or if you can even own them at a certain age to requiring permits before obtaining certain guns or carrying them a certain way (concealed carry).  People are held accountable for crimes involving their firearms, even if no shots are fired or no one is hurt (as they should be). A person who allows access to their firearm which results in an accident (parents letting their kid get a hold of an unsecured firearm) can absolutely be charged and held liable for it.  We can track ballistics to a specific gun if there is enough reason to test the gun in question- but you need probable cause or a warrant just as a police officer would need either of those things to search your vehicle if they thought it was involved in a crime.  Edit for minor spelling"
Colorado,37tghm,megman13,5,Sat May 30 17:55:34 2015 UTC,"No, they can't. The idea that you can instantly know exactly what brand/make of weapon fired a particular bullet is a Hollywood fantasy. Even if they could narrow it down to say, the 30-06 caliber, which would require them to have a bullet that they're POSITIVE came from the shooter, then they could go look at their handy database of every weapon in the state. Which they don't have. Nor will they ever, because the majority of voters in the state will never approve a gun registration bill.   If they have both the weapon and the bullet, they can match them together. But one is useless without the other.

After the events on Saturday he allowed everyone to read the speech and everyone supported him and his decision. It truly seemed to be that the administration had a problem with it. The board and the administration at the school have had very heavy conservative views but it never really bled into the school policy or actions of the students until that night. The highschool hasn't been the very most organized, but that was to be expected as it opened in 2011. But this was uncalled for and it has been a unanimous decision from my class that it was a poor action from my school."
Colorado,37q0sj,Alt-4-me,6,Fri May 29 18:49:34 2015 UTC,I always knew that it was on the conservative side because of knowing who was in my class and their parents who were also board members.

If their parents are straight, they see it all the time. Being gay isn't about sex. It's about who you love. And there's nothing wrong with telling a child that some people love people of the opposite gender, most love people of the same gender, and when they get older they'll know who they love. You don't have to even come close to mentioning sex to say that."

Colorado,37q0sj,Malne,8,Fri May 29 18:05:30 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, anything can be anything  ""depending on your personal beliefs and outlook.""  I think common decency dictates that a person has the right to inform others of their sexuality on their own terms. That's my personal belief. Regardless of what the kid's plans were, he has the right to disclose what he wants to on his own terms.  Imagine you had a big surprise planned for somebody. A 60th birthday party, or maybe you just got engaged or found out you were going to have a kid. A few days earlier, your shitty little brother (or school administrator, as the case may be) blurts out the big news and ruins the surprise. Do you really think that ""they were gonna find out soon enough anyway, heh, what's the big deal?"" is an appropriate or acceptable response?"

It is not the end of the world and it is an appropriate adult response to move on even if you're disappointed in how it was revealed.   You didn't get to reveal you were pregnant? Oh well, turns out you're still pregnant and that's the important part, you were going to reveal it anyway.   Turns out you were pregnant but lost the baby? That's sad and obviously worse because you might not want that grief shared with the world, but you can't get the baby back and you have bigger things to deal with.   Your crazy ex husband found out after you left his abuse and went into hiding? Obvious consequences yet to come, worst of the lot, now you should be outraged.   Arguing that ""anything can be anything"" is a straw man argument when there are clear degrees of impact to different scenarios.  AFAIK there is no restriction on disclosure of sexual orientation in FERPA or HIPAA and schools can restrict free speech.  You're conflating ""common decency"" with an ethical imperative to preserve the ""rights"" of a person under the care and administration of a governing body that has been found repeatedly capable of restricting said rights up to and including Supreme Court cases.   Again, I'm not saying what he did was right. I'm not saying it was proper. I'm saying of all the problems with this event, the disclosure of the student's sexual orientation to his parents is of little real consequence and there are better things to be outraged by."

That said, the Supreme Court has upheld all kinds of reprehensible policies over the years, so I don't know if invoking their authority necessarily validates the point that you're trying to make.    Arguing that ""anything can be anything"" is a straw man argument when there are clear degrees of impact to different scenarios.   I'm sorry I made you invoke the logical fallacy here.  My point is that outing someone else is reprehensible. Sure, one can imagine circumstances in which it would have more dire consequences, but that isn't really material. In fact, I think you may have actually fallen into your own logical fallacy with that sort of reasoning :)  As you may have noticed in my original post, I added on the bit about the principal as sort of an afterthought. I agree with you that it's not the most despicable aspect of this situation, but as I read the article it did jump out at me as a pretty unpleasant incidental slight to the student and his family."

Makes you look like some sort of bad parent.  Anyone care how parents feel?

There are always rules placed on graduations and speeches at these events. Is it restricting his speech? Yes. Is that the schools choice as a private institution to allow it? Yes. They didn't feel it would be appropriate, and if I am honest, being the liberal guy I am, I don't think coming out during a graduation speech is all that appropriate.

Although I don't know what his speech entailed, I am inclined to believe he could have effectively conveyed his message while also respecting the wishes of the school administration. As the previous valedictorian of my high school, there was a lot of help and support that went into the writing and editing of the valedictorian speech, and it was far from a free-for-all in regard to what could be said. Although he worked hard to become valedictorian, the opportunity to speak at the graduation ceremony is a privilege and not a right. Additionally, I also question how mature Evan really is in light of him ""removing the sleeves of his graduation gown"" and submitting an initial draft of his speech that was ""condescending toward the school and the student’s peers and included ridiculing comments about faculty and students."" Nevertheless, he should have been acknowledged at the ceremony and it is too bad the situation has devolved into what it has."
Colorado,37q0sj,ImagineWagon,2,Fri May 29 16:57:15 2015 UTC,"I think this is the problem with charter schools, which could be wonderful laboratories of innovation. Instead, because they are typically used as political tools of the extreme right, the leadership and culture is overwhelmingly Christian and the morals they seek to uphold are exclusionary toward those people they deem sinful and immoral. This makes them harmful in ways that are inappropriate for public institutions. And because they are largely unaccountable to anyone within the district, they get away with it in most cases. It is worth noting this is not the only such religious bias in Colorado's less than flattering news stories recently (Thanks ACLU). The theme of his speech was keeping secrets and the emotional trauma they can have on a person. That is a great topic for young people to learn as they prepare for college, trade school, a job, or a year traveling in Tasmania. If his 'big' secret was overcoming a struggle with his Christian faith, bulimia, anorexia, or an addiction to video games it would have been deemed a moral enough secret to reveal. Now - this is not about the school, or whether charter schools are better, or who is right. It is about a young man who was told he was to dirty to be shared in public. He will have that thought in his mind for the rest of his life. His college lover will feel like a mistake. He will probably feel that his relationship with his spouse is less than the 'normal' ones around him. Where is the 'sin' in this story?   Edit: added think. Duh..."

The graduation is for everyone, not just for one kid to use a captive audience to make announcements to those gathered.   I wish him the best of luck in the future, and hope he learns from this experience and becomes less selfish."
Colorado,37q0sj,firefighter5145,8,Fri May 29 15:42:52 2015 UTC,Bully pulpit? He isn't the president man. These speeches usually focus on personal struggles and I'm guessing hiding his sexuality was one of his biggest struggles.
Colorado,37q0sj,skinsfan55,1 point,Fri May 29 16:48:25 2015 UTC,He is there to speak to his peers with regard to moving into the next chapter of THEIR lives and to provide a speech that does not pass on his own selfish agenda. I support gay rights but this is not the appropriate venue for announcing to the world your're gay.
Colorado,37q0sj,rodmandiplomacy,-3,Fri May 29 16:49:50 2015 UTC,"He's got a captive audience who has to listen to him, hence, bully pulpit.   That BS about speeches focusing on personal struggles is a false narrative. No they're not. I'm a teacher so I can just about guarantee I've seen more graduation speeches than you. If they're personal at all, it's light and fleeting. They're overwhelmingly about the class's struggles and accomplishments.   This kid just sounds needy and selfish and even a slanted article like the one OP posted has to admit that he had problems with authority and following the rules. Read the parts about him cutting the sleeves off his graduation gown and the revisions they asked him to make so as to be less mean-spirited towards classmates and staff.   Sounds like he'll fit in perfectly at Rutgers."
Colorado,37q0sj,firefighter5145,5,Fri May 29 16:53:24 2015 UTC,"Except most valedictorian speeches are based on personal experience (at least all of them that I've ever heard).

If a small group wants to get together at lunch and talk about something they all have in common (religion or not), then they should have the freedom to do that without a dictatorship.  Christians and Catholics and any other religion has the right to believe homosexuality is wrong for society as you, I, or anyone else feels as though it is natural, yet the media would have you believe that Christians, Catholics, and Jews are Satan incarnate.

But having church sponsored events with a religious message from ANY religion at a public school shouldn't happen.   The opinions of Christians concerning gays(that's it's wrong and/or not a ""real"" marriage) isn't respected because many of the reasons given to support their view (the bible says its wrong, kids need both a mother and father, its not natural, marriage is between a man and woman, etc) are not convincing, or seen as bigoted by the other side.

The fact that the teacher is the only one bothered by this and that no parent is involved in the lawsuit tells me that they were fine with what was going on.  If the parents had a problem, I wouldn't be typing right now.  That I understand, but nobody said that this Jewish teacher couldn't practice whatever religion he wanted.  Nobody stopped him from being a Jew.  He was simply annoyed because, again, he felt as though if it isn't Jewish, it isn't right.  THAT'S DISCRIMINATION!!!!

The real violation here is a school supported bible study provided during school hours on school grounds. They also supported it by announcing it over the intercoms.

Colorado,37ln3v,satanisativa,2,Thu May 28 15:00:20 2015 UTC,"My neighborhood has a co-op and apparently you don't have a choice to use it. I tried to switch my Xcel service from my previous house and it didn't work - we were told we had to use IREA.   It wasn't a huge investment if I recall, though we are always surprised at how low our electric bill is. One big downside is that our co-op won't pay for surplus power from solar panels like Xcel does. But since we haven't added any solar panels yet it's probably worth the savings. When I do add solar it will probably just be to power/supplement my grow room."
Colorado,37ln3v,mesostoney,1 point,Thu May 28 16:27:58 2015 UTC,"We rent a house (me +3), and the landlord lets us do what we want (within reason). There is no HOA or anything like that for the neighborhood, so we can choose we want.  Our main goal is to lower our energy bills and we thought a coop might do that. Sounds like yours did?"
Colorado,37ln3v,mesostoney,1 point,Thu May 28 16:55:49 2015 UTC,"Hard to say in my case because so many factors were involved that would make our electric costs different from one house to the next.  We upgraded in square feet by quite a bit, but our electric price generally went down.  That being said, the place we were renting previously had inefficient single-pane windows with wood frames, so winter was brutal. I think at one point we were paying Xcel $170 a month, and I think that's around the highest I've ever seen it at our new house, even though it has over 3 times as much square footage to heat and cool. Plus I'm now using at least 1Kwh of electricity for a grow room. So either my old house was really shitty as far as efficiency, or the co-op is totally worth it. Maybe a combination of both."

Colorado,37hk3u,bucknuggets,7,Thu May 28 17:03:15 2015 UTC,"It was my understanding that Prigg v Pennsylvania ruled that Penn folks absolutely could be compelled to ignore state law in lieu of Federal law unless there were state laws specifically prohibiting such actions.  In Prigg v Penn Prigg went up to Penn to chase after a slave who was living freely in Penn.  Penn at the time had a law stating that no  one in Penn could be compelled to give up a fugitive slave, which ran contradictory to the Federal Fugitive Slave Act, which essentially said that if a slave escaped they were still property of the slave owner and they would need to be returned to their owner.  And Prigg won the case, not Penn.  The slave was ordered to be returned to her slaveowner, and the Pennsylvania law was ruled unconstitutional.  BUT in that ruling one of the justices was all ""this probably wouldn't be unconstitutional if you guys had laws making it illegal to assist the Feds with Fugitive Slave Act issues"", and so that's what Penn did -- drew up a pile of laws that made it illegal for anyone to assist the feds in these fugitive slave act instances.  For A64 to mirror this, we would have to pass a law making it illegal for Colorado law enforcement to assist the Federal government in marijuana cases.  I have no expectation that we would ever do any such thing.  BUT it doesn't matter, because in the 90s half of the Brady bill was seen unconstitutional, and that ruling decision explicitly talks about how state LEO can't be compelled to uphold Federal laws:   The Constitution does not leave to speculation who is to administer the laws enacted by Congress; the President, it says, ""shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,"" Art. II, §3, personally and through officers whom he appoints (save for such inferior officers as Congress may authorize to be appointed by the ""Courts of Law"" or by ""the Heads of Departments"" who with other presidential appointees)   Holy shit this is almost as long as the original article."
Colorado,37hk3u,DeviatedNorm,12,Wed May 27 18:23:55 2015 UTC,"This article is nonsense.  ""For the math-challenged that means federal courts have held the feds cannot require state officers to enforce federal law for 173 years.""  Because that happens all over the nation.  All law enforcement nationwide has enforced Federal Law for a long time.  To blame these sheriffs for doing what everyone else is doing in the entire country, is just a shot below the belt.  This article is a lot of nonsense, they mix a lot of things that have no connection.  This is just a pot shot at the sheriffs for whatever reason.  If it wasn't they would have pointed out that this isn't a problem of Colorado Sheriffs as much as it is a problem nationwide.  Nonetheless, the whole issue is for naught.  Seeing how Texan Republicans are right as we speak passing legislation to legalize marijuana (on religious grounds I might add), I don't see how this nationwide ban on marijuana is going to stay for much longer, especially when all these states see all the money $$$ and industry involved.  Realize something like 90% of all materials in the United States are in some way, shape, or form made with oil.  Realize that industrialized hemp can replace everything we make from oil with hemp.  From what I also understand hemp is a great crop that replenishes the earth it's grown on, and produces far more products we get from trees, about 4 times the amount, on the same acreage of land.  The funniest thing I see about this organization pointing this out, is that they claim to be fighting against a strong decentralized government, yet they're taking the time out going after these little guys, and not the Federal Government itself.  We did all hear on the news that the President called for Federalizing all police forces in the entire nation, right?  Where is this tenth amendment organization on that?

Colorado,37e89v,spaceghoti,15,Tue May 26 23:59:50 2015 UTC,"The article doesn't do a good job of addressing what the complaints are. Read through the complaint document at the bottom and, if true, some of this stuff is pretty scary. Here are a few excerpts:   In addition to daily prayers in front of the school, Pastor Pfaff and the Church, with the support of the School’s administration, routinely minister to staff and students through the distribution of flyers promoting their evangelical Christian views. These flyers quote scripture, advocate for the biblical creation narrative, purport to be memos from God to students, offer behavioral prescriptions based on evangelical Christian doctrine, and explicitly invoke Christian theology. With the support of the School’s staff, including Principal Schipper, Pastor Pfaff and the Church distribute these flyers throughout the School, making their presence ubiquitous, including in teacher mailboxes, classrooms, and the School’s guidance office. In addition, the Church, with support of the School’s administration, has placed a “Prayer Requests” box in the faculty lounge.  In cooperation with the School’s administration, Pastor Pfaff and the Church also distribute to students bibles and placards promoting the Church. Allegedly a “scholarship night” for seniors, this bible distribution event is primarily a vehicle for the Church to leverage state sponsorship to further its sectarian agenda.   These are probably against Murray v. Curlett and Stone v. Graham.   Shortly after Mr. Basevitz began working at the School, he observed School staff using the public address system to promote a prayer ceremony led by Pastor Pfaff. According to repeated announcements over the P.A., the ceremony was to take place on September 24, 2014, the day on which Rosh Hashanah—the Jewish new year—begins. Flyers promoting the service were also distributed to staff and students. They read, “God loves you and so do we,” and listed the sole contact person as Pastor Pfaff, who represented himself as an “approved RE-2 school district volunteer.”   That's against Engel v. Vitale.   On January 20, 2015, only 33 days after his formal complaint against Pastor Pfaff and the Church, Principal Schipper met with Mr. Basevitz and informed him that he was being transferred to Penrose Elementary School. In violation of Article 9 of the collective bargaining agreement, the District failed to provide Mr. Basevitz, who had no previous elementary school experience, a written reason for its decision. That same day, Superintendent Vendetti sent Mr. Basevitz a letter stating that no action would be taken against Principal Schipper or Pastor Pfaff in response to his complaint.   That's just a dick move.    After reading that, I believe the plaintiff is justified in bringing the suit. Some relevant previous rulings from the Supreme Court:  Engel v. Vitale, 82 S. Ct. 1261 (1962): Any kind of prayer, composed by public school districts, even nondenominational prayer, is unconstitutional government sponsorship of religion.  Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963): Court finds Bible reading over school intercom unconstitutional    Murray v. Curlett, 374 U.S. 203 (1963): Court finds forcing a child to participate in Bible reading and prayer unconstitutional.  Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39 (1980): Court finds posting of the Ten Commandments in schools unconstitutional.  Source"

Colorado,37bu32,hoopervillain,5,Tue May 26 14:57:44 2015 UTC,"Geologist here! /u/projecktzero is correct. They're called surge flows. Medano creek doesn't have enough energy to carry the sand a long distance so it gets carried a small distance and piles up under the surface in structures called ""antidunes"". The antidunes collapse and lets the surge out, which carries the sand downstream a little again until it piles up and busts. Rinse, repeat."
Colorado,37bu32,codfos,3,Tue May 26 17:45:01 2015 UTC,Very cool.  I happened to take some video of that happening.  [loud video] @ 1:49 you can see the antidunes forming and then @ 2:10 a nice surge comes through.
Colorado,37bu32,codfos,1 point,Wed May 27 03:01:42 2015 UTC,When I Was there at the end of April the water wasn't nearly that high so the surge flows were only an inch or two. That's pretty cool to see them like that.
Colorado,37bu32,projecktzero,3,Wed May 27 03:08:04 2015 UTC,They call it surge flow. Something to do with the sand being carried by the river and piling up.
Colorado,37bu32,Figgler,2,Tue May 26 17:19:56 2015 UTC,"I was there last weekend and that's how it was. Medano creek was coming in waves, I had never experienced a river do that before."
Colorado,37bu32,sparty1711,2,Tue May 26 16:19:17 2015 UTC,"When was this?  I was there for the first time early Sunday, and rain storms were coming in as we drove north."

Colorado,37fios,yewdontknowjack,2,Sat May 30 02:32:03 2015 UTC,I think the important thing to remember is that things like this are a kind of compromise. We tend to forget not everybody is friendly to the movement... some people (and candidates in particular) are violently opposed to it. I think this adds some legitimacy to legalization for those still questioning it and shows them smokers can (and should) be responsible.

If yours doesn't have one, or doesn't include trailers, you could use Larimer's to get a rough estimate: http://larimer.org/clerk/estimator/  I'd expect the more populated counties to cost a little more."

Colorado,374blr,sarautu,2,Mon May 25 02:44:38 2015 UTC,"about $10 for the title transfer, about $55 for the 1 year registration (includes the $2 for the metal plate), and on top you'll pay sales tax based on where you live and the amount you paid for the trailer.  Sales taxes vary... state tax is 2.9%, but on top of that is any county or city tax, so most folks end up paying sales tax around 6% to 8%."

I mean like entire towns. In fact this state actually have more uninhabited towns than there are inhabited ones. I spent 2 days hiking around Arapahoe state forest and found plenty of ghost towns.

I can't say that's there any certain spots other than ""Lookout Moutain"" in Golden but other than that, just keep close to the foothills and don't wonder too deep in the mountains.  I got lost once because wandered too far and ended having to sleep under the stars one night. Sound fun and magical? NOPE, I frozed my balls off. I had to hunker down and cover myself in like 2 ft of dead dried up leaves to keep myself warm. Mind you this happened in early August of 2012, one of the hottest summers recorded in CO.

With all the tree cover there won't be much natural light and I don't know if flashlights would be sufficient.  This is one of my preferred hikes when it is hot out because of all the shade.

Colorado,36y1gw,kidbom,5,Sat May 23 01:51:38 2015 UTC,"Ya know, it's not just the Walmart worker-class either.   I knew a women who was smart as all get out. But she was also a single mom, so every time her kid got sick she had to stay home from work. Our job had no paid sick days, and to boot, she got written up each time as an unexcused absence. Because of this, she had worked there 3 years and was barely paid about the wage she was hired at, not too mention no chance at being promoted.   I've never forgotten this, and this is just one reason of many why gov't needs to get involved in this area."
Colorado,36y1gw,bahnzo,-2,Sat May 23 07:10:24 2015 UTC,"Sounds like she should have been searching for another employer. This one wasn't benefitting her in the ways she needed it.  If an employer has to pay for no work (paid sick leave) then they'll pay less overall.   I see ZERO reason for government to get involved in this area. There are employees who don't need health insurance (military retired, spouse has it, etc.), don't need paid sick days and don't need paid personal leave (young, healthy, no kids, etc.). These people don't need a job that provides these things at the expense of their standard wage. They'd just be leaving money on the table there.  Your co-worker needed to work elsewhere, and don't say that she couldn't have found somewhere else in 3 years time."
Colorado,36y1gw,raiderato,1 point,Sun May 24 18:02:38 2015 UTC,"If there was a viable union culture, the government wouldn't need to step in and create benefits. Benefits could be negotiated between the employers and employees through union contracts."
Colorado,36y1gw,satanisativa,1 point,Fri May 29 02:18:25 2015 UTC,"Benefits can also be negotiated between individuals. It happens daily. You just have to do it.  If she felt she needed a union to negotiate for her, then she is welcome to find a profession that's represented by a union."
Colorado,36y1gw,raiderato,0,Fri May 29 13:02:49 2015 UTC,"Benefits can also be negotiated between individuals. It happens daily. You just have to do it.   Right, but there's nothing saying a employer has to give the employee anything. With a union, both parties have to negotiate wages, hours and benefits in good faith. Plus, it grants leverage to workers to speak as one voice rather than individuals. That's why union workers consistently make higher wages than their non-union counterparts.   then she is welcome to find a profession that's represented by a union.   Less than 7% of the workforce has a union, thanks to the ongoing war against the right of workers to organize."
Colorado,36y1gw,satanisativa,0,Fri May 29 16:08:27 2015 UTC,"... but there's nothing saying a employer has to give the employee anything.    If you and your employer agree to work under certain conditions and benefits, there is.   ... thanks to the ongoing war against the right of workers to organize.   There's nothing stopping people from organizing. That'd be antithetical the 1st Amendment.  You're conflating making people to pay money to a union as a condition of employment whether they want to join or not with a ""war against the right of workers to organize."""
Colorado,36y1gw,raiderato,1 point,Sat May 30 03:09:07 2015 UTC,"If you and your employer agree to work under certain conditions and benefits, there is.   Yes, I realize people with degrees and specialized skills sign contracts for their employment and discuss benefits and stock options and all that.   Those aren't the people I'm talking about. I'm talking about the majority of the low-wage workers. Don't know how long it's been since you've worked in that sector, but benefits are non-existant. Wages are dictated, take it or leave it, cuz there's a million more people who will do it for minimum wage (or less if they can get away with it). So the whole pretense of ""well, demand better things"" aren't really useful, since it's easy to fire someone who demands a more money or makes trouble for the operation. Employers and employees are more often than not on unequal footing to begin with. You can't demand a fair fight between a tiny twink and a professional boxer. Unions give workers that power. I'm not talking about the bloated, corrupt ALF-CIO or Teamsters. Workers don't need to affiliate necessarily with an establishment union. Or there are overtly political unions, like the IWW. You want a free market? It has to be fair to begin with.   There's nothing stopping people from organizing.    Right, since you can't outright prohibit a union, you simply make them powerless, by forcing it to accept non-paying employees in their contracts and making effective collective bargaining impossible by splitting the workers between themselves. Throw in free trade deals that force us to compete against the poorest people in the world for wages, an effective smear campaign by business interests to discourage workers from organizing, and of course corruption and ineptitude by Big Labor doesn't help either.   You're conflating making people to pay money to a union as a condition of employment whether they want to join    So workers who benefit from what a union can negotiate for them shouldn't help support that union? You support free-riders? C'mon son."

The way the ACA is written, once these types of birth control became over-the-counter they would no longer need to be covered by insurance.

Colorado,36wpaq,HighAngleAlpha0331,5,Sat May 23 07:08:16 2015 UTC,Well don't go pick up birth control and it's not forced on you. See how easy that is?
Colorado,36wpaq,bzzltyr,-2,Sat May 23 14:00:28 2015 UTC,"I think free birth control is a great idea versus all kinds of women having children and then needing assistance for that. That said, and I'm just playing devil's advocate here, some people are not happy with their hard earned (tax) money being funneled into programs that in no way affect them. I can see why it would bother some people and how some people would feel they are being ""forced"" to pay for something they don't agree with. The BC is not free when taxpayers are footing the bill and they are essentially being forced to pay for these programs via the tax dollars that they A) Have no say over how much they pay and B) have no say over how the money they worked 40+ hours a week for is spent."
Colorado,36wpaq,torro947,5,Sat May 23 14:24:59 2015 UTC,"That's my initial point though is this does not have the economic impact you are alluding too. Multiple studies have shown that providing birth control at low/no cost has a dramatic impact on the number of unplanned pregnancies. So much so that it's cheaper to provide birth control to many than pay the delivery costs of a few. When you consider the ongoing costs of medical care needed to a child the first few years of their life it's a staggering difference. So you aren't paying for someone else's birth control, your insurance foots it to avoid astronomical other fees. If the birth control goes away the costs you pay towards someone else's care go way up."
Colorado,36wpaq,bzzltyr,1 point,Sat May 23 14:57:29 2015 UTC,You're really preaching to the choir on that one. I understand the need for it and also that it costs more for a pregnancy than birth control. I'm just saying I can see how some taxpayers would be upset with paying for publicly funded birth control. Those people need to look at the bigger picture but i totally get where they are coming from.

Colorado,36s2b6,CoGa,6,Fri May 22 03:48:46 2015 UTC,"A lot of Boulder residents are complaining that this was a bait and switch for numerous reasons:   No additional general purpose lanes Cost of tolls Promised rail line, got BRT Not actually BRT, just express bus service   Adding additional general purpose lanes would not help congestion on 36 as the concept of induced demand shows. If 36 was expanded with a free lane, it would just get more congested. 36 does not have the traffic of 25 to necessitate additional general lanes on the scale of an interstate. Additionally, when TREX was being discussed, they eventually decided on light rail over expanding 25 because it was easier to add capacity to rail than to widen the highway and be stuck in the same situation as before when more people drove.  The cost of tolls is one way to add capacity without encouraging many to use that additional capacity. Drivers already under pay for road services, and this is an attempt to internalize the costs of an expanded highway while allowing the express bus to generally use it with convenience.  The rail line argument is the strongest, but still ultimately weak. A rail line, while theoretically attracting a greater percentage of rich transit users than a bus would, would not serve substantially more users (other than Longmont) than the planned Flatiron Flyer (FF). The majority of the planned rail stations are incredibly close to the 36 park n rides (PNR). Many of the stations don't have enough transit oriented development that would have people walking to those stations instead of driving to a PNR to make them more utilized than an express bus.  This also gets to the cost of express bus versus commuter rail. As planned, the FF will service the 36 corridor every 15 minutes, a 100% improvement in service time from the existing BV schedule. This is on par with the F light rail, and that is not even including the additional rush hour express lines. It is unlikely, especially as the northwest rail line is described as a commuter rail, that the rail line would have this level of frequency of service. Which also gets to usage: it's frequent service, not rail v bus, that better increases transit mode share.  Finally, BRT would have been great with dedicated central platforms, pre boarding payment, and ground level bus entry. Perhaps that is what the express lanes and the pedestrian walkways are eventually being set up for. If so, that's great long term planning. There really isn't otherwise an excuse for not having prepayment or dedicated central platforms.  However, our transit usage in Colorado is unique when it comes to the buses planned (effectively the same coach buses already used) because of our outdoor culture combined with the last mile access problem. Many more cyclists take their bikes to the bus for use later in their transit. Most BRT at best have space for 3 bikes, while there can be 4+ stored on a FF bus, with much of that space in use. RTD has obviously considered this unique mode share use, but hopefully there are plans in the future to accommodate this need on actual BRT rolling stock."

Colorado,36i8cc,coloradobro,6,Tue May 19 16:49:40 2015 UTC,That's fucking weird. Maybe the shot out windows were misses....
Colorado,36i8cc,skippythemoonrock,6,Tue May 19 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"Many think at first it was a bb/pellet gun. I hope the two snipers are unrelated, cause that means the douche stepped up killing people."
Colorado,36i8cc,coloradobro,10,Tue May 19 17:23:15 2015 UTC,"A BB gun couldn't piece a laminated window. It could embed, but not puncture."
Colorado,36i8cc,skippythemoonrock,3,Tue May 19 17:25:41 2015 UTC,"exactly why I was skeptical of this assumption. The coloadoan stated it was a bb/pellet gun but after seeing a car taped off with the back window completely shattered, there is no way it was a bb or a pellet."
Colorado,36i8cc,coloradobro,8,Tue May 19 17:29:18 2015 UTC,A regular bb gun usually couldn't piece a standard home window let alone an automotive tempered window. This is some maniac with a high powered rifle taking pot shots at the highway.

Colorado,36i8cc,EffThatFace,6,Tue May 19 18:14:57 2015 UTC,I have a dash cam but it is such a wide angle it probably would be hard to spot a sniper. Unless they were right in front of you.   I feel sorry for the guy just out riding his bike.
Colorado,36i8cc,WheresTheGotcha,3,Tue May 19 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"If they havnt been seen yet they are likely taking action to not be seen. I say they because snipers usually work in teams, the shooting of the car windows was probably live training for the one without as much training. I hope I'm wrong and I probably am as I'm high and working on a beer now but that's how the dc snipers worked, iirc they killed one of their first in tucson at a golf course near my dojo so I followed the story closely."

Actively funds politicians that appose renewable energy. Lobbies to expand unsustainable business practices.  Sues municipalities that enact zoning restrictions.    How is this different then the Phillips Morris and the tobacco industry from the 60s to the 80s?

Recycling used plastics is also very energy intensive and sometimes regarded to be a net-zero gain.

Colorado,36f250,Stonecipher,2,Wed May 20 02:07:38 2015 UTC,"I can agree that having the governor likely would be a distraction to students during finals week and one week's notice is a bit short notice.  But we hosted the governor here at my company (Intel Fort Collins) last week with about two and a half weeks notice and I helped with organizing the event.  The security requirements were not very difficult at all - in fact, I don't actually remember any requirements at all during our organizational meetings and I was present in all the meetings (I helped set up the booths and a movie).  While there's likely a bit of a real concern about disruption to student's routine in the last week of school, the thing seems primarily politically motivated, and that's a bit of a shame.  To me, it should be an honor to host our elected leader of our state regardless of whether you agree with his political views or not.   I know that when any of our elected officials visit our company - regardless of political affiliation - it's always an honor and a privilege to host them as well as an opportunity to have an interesting dialogue on our differences in opinion."

There is at least one project to expand reservoir capacity; the Chatfield Reservoir Reallocation Project (http://cwcb.state.co.us/water-management/water-projects-programs/Pages/ChatfieldReservoirReallocationProject.aspx), which has been controversial in that it will impact the animal habitat.  Here is a picture of the before and proposed after once it is expanded: http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2011/0101/20110101__chatfield~p1.jpg  I believe the project has been approved, although I am not 100% certain, and if it has been, when it would start.  If you really want a deep dive, a study was done in 2010 to determine necessary changes to meet Colorado's needed water supply in the future: http://cwcb.state.co.us/water-management/water-supply-planning/Pages/SWSI2010.aspx  I have not ready any of this, but I am curious if it covers both municipal and agricultural water needs.

Colorado,36dlfh,Theawesome67,9,Mon May 18 15:25:03 2015 UTC,"I can speak for the Big Thompson Canyon. Before the flood the river corridor was mature and green. Soil crusts covered the immediate vicinity of the river. Old branches and strainers provided habitat for fish. Moss and Lichens covered every rock in and around the river.  Now 'between the banks' it looks like it was sandblasted clean and in some places to the bedrock. Instead of darkly colored rocks they are a light color like what you buy in a bag at Home Depot. On the sides of the banks are mangled trees and some trees on the bank just vanished.   It did not, however, impact areas outside the flood bank.   But honestly the 'damaged' areas have their own beauty to it. It's a reminder of the geologic processes that formed the canyon in the first place. It's really neat to be able to have seen the canyon in both states."

It made its own path in some places, and you can see some obvious erosion. Various creek trails and a few bridges had to be repaired, and most of it has been completed by now (although the trails got flooded and damaged again just last week).  The piece of the Dillon Rd bypass that got washed away (the scene of the dramatic water rescue on CNN) remains washed out and closed, as it was low traffic and low priority... I'm still baffled as to why any through-traffic was on it, as there is a better road right next to it. That's about 10 feet from a trail that I sometimes bike on, and it's kind of interesting to look at... Can still see pieces of the road, with road lines painted on them, in the giant hole."

Colorado,3631w7,DesignNoobie99,0,Fri May 15 18:00:48 2015 UTC,"Are we still trotting out this ""war on women"" thing even after the Udall disaster?"
Colorado,3631w7,irieCO,2,Fri May 15 18:53:51 2015 UTC,"You know, one one hand, I appreciate the term 'war on women' because it portrays the sexism problem as serious.  On the other hand, I really really don't like it, because it also implies that there is an active enemy waging the war, and mostly, there isn't. Sure, there are some legislators and red pill jerkwads random people who genuinely think women are inferior and should have limited legal rights, but no decent person would think that way, and the world is full of people who think they are decent. Most of the sexism related problems that women face as a whole are due to deeply imbedded cultural biases that have been around since the advent of agriculture. Most people don't think they are sexist. Most people who catcall, treat women like children, judge them by their appearance, or judge them to be less competent or less rational don't think they are sexist.   Just like most people who think men are driven by their libido, or mock men for displaying emotion, or think stay at home dads aren't successful, judge a man's value by how much sex he gets, or tell a guy to ""man up"" don't think they are sexist.  Instead of saying that there is a war, with an enemy who needs to be fought, let's say that there are cultural biases that need to be examined and people who are ignorant and need to be educated. Let's wait for someone to actively tell us that women don't deserve to be treated as equals before we label everyone an enemy."

It was a blow to me, but I have been applying like crazy and it looks like I will have to take a couple of minimum wage jobs until I finish school, so I am not homeless.  Oh well, I suppose."

Everyone always just assumed I had one, all the way back to the very beginning. What I've noticed is that a lot of people simply won't apply to jobs who are ""requiring"" higher education. I've applied unapologetically to every job I felt I was qualified for, and I got them. A degree is an ""ask"" in most cases and usually, as long as the person has all of the other qualifications, it doesn't really come up. Just my experience. But I'm not being ""completely"" unfair.

Construction is suppose to have increased spending this year compared to previous years so there that. Hospitality type jobs and leisure business jobs are suppose to be up as well.  You may have to switch fields if your current field of expertise isn't panning out and, yes, you will have to start at the bottom in some cases.

That shouldn't be a tough requirement to fulfill.  You don't need to be humble (hell, that's often more irritating than a wanna be rock star), just an average Jane or Joe who likes making things.   I have had a very tough time satisfying both of these criteria simultaneously.    The savings factor isn't really a consideration for me, as I standardize pay for my fulltimers.

There is a serious dearth of mid to senior level engineers with C++ experience and domain knowledge in our field. It's easy to drop clichés like ""free market"" and ""I'm an econ major"" but the truth is far more complicated. Java and C# are hot, far fewer have stuck to C/C++ 10+ years into their career, especially after the 01 and 08 recession.

Both Republicans and Democrats pushed this bill based on the fact that private companies make tons of money off tickets and accidents actually increase in areas where cameras are used.

But as for data, what I do know is there is a serious lack of quantifiable data to support red light cameras.  But on the other hand, there is some data that might support them.  It appears the total number of accidents at intersections does not significantly drop, in fact it may go higher - but it is the type of accident that occurs.  Some of the data suggests that there are more rear end accidents (likely someone slamming their brakes so they don't get a ticket) but fewer side accidents.  That may indicate the severity of accidents has decreased as fewer drivers are running red lights so late that they are driving through oncoming traffic.  But in all honesty I'm on the fence on this topic, I neither have a strong opinion that red light cameras are a great accident retardant but I also don't have that strong of an opinion opposing them (perhaps because I don't run red lights...uhoh here comes the downvotes)."

There is inconclusive evidence as to accident injuries and fatalities.  But I think the biggest issue is that red light cameras are sold as a public safety issue when actually they are simply for generating revenue.  I also think the way that companies install these and charge municipalities administrative fees on them is kind of corrupt.  The company tells the city it's for money and safety, when really they are just taking a cut from citizens most of whom can't defend themselves without taking time off from work hurting them either way.  And I don't run red lights, I did get a ticket one from one in a rental car once because I turned right on red (legally) and the headache from that is enough for me (and seemingly a lot of people) to oppose them."

I have succesfully challenged camera tickets with credit rating agencies by telling them I have no contract with the company and there is no civil or criminal court ruling requiring me to pay them. I think the worst a city can legally do is treat these like parking tickets, possibly booting your car, but I doubt it would stand up in a criminal court and that's likely why they don't try more aggressively to collect.  The problems stem from the fact that most municipal systems treat these cameras as a way to collect revenue by skirting consitutional requirements such as right to trial by a jury or elected judge, right to face your accuser, innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, right to be free against unreasonable seizures, the necessity to actually legally serve summons' in person.

I think that this is a state issue and not just a local issue because these cameras fly in the face of a central tenet of our justice system, which is the right to face your accuser.

Those that do, may not have the luxury of showing up and changing out of sweaty clothes, or have the time a bike commute requires. Others may not be able to bike, or have duties that are incompatible with using a bicycle.   Cyclists are always quick to blame drivers, but the fact is many cyclist are not very good at following the law either, like most people its a mix.

There is no point in an ""ordered right of way"" when there is no one else there; I think it's pretty obvious that cyclists don't go through a Stop sign when there is traffic. Furthermore, laws should represent a social behavior and ensure for safety; as there is no danger to cyclists treating a stop sign as a yield sign, the Idaho stop makes total sense.

We can only afford the increase in rent to live within biking distance because of all the money we save by not owning a car. It's not always a luxury thing.

Do you mean riding near to or on the traffic lane from a bike lane? Many of the bike lanes near me are directly in the ""door zone"" of cars, are full of glass, gravel and other debris, have some bad potholes, don't get plowed when it snows, have deep puddles when it's raining, are a default loading zone for taxis (illegally), or sometimes all of the above.

I still don't think that riding a bike, for transport or for fun, should ever require a geater level of privilege than owning a car. If it does, that's fucked up, and is the kind of problem that studies like this one are trying to address. Similar lists exist for workplaces, too. One reason owning a car can be necessary for some people to get by, especially based on where they live, is because of very shortsighted city planning and suburban expansion that led to people living far from their job in the first place.

I'm an avid rider and I've lost count of how many times I've been buzzed by police vehicles. And when people see them do it, they assume it's ok. The 3-foot law is a joke.   And, just today I was riding and came across a line of pickups all parked in the bike lane. The reason? They were fishing. Of course there's parking just down the road 100ft.

Regardless what us IT security guys try to enforce, or compliance tries to require, there is always that bigwig who doesn't want the inconvenience of having ""another"" email account. Most people in politics are business people with the resources to run a campaign and the schedule flexibility of being top dawg at whatever thing they do. Those same very people who have the convenience over practicality brain in the private sector are going to do it in the public sector.  All it would really take is State IT to have some brass balls and say ""no, we're not going to forward to outside email accounts due to the security risks/liabilities for everyone involved. You get an email of ""hd# or sd# @coloradoleg.gov or whatever, and an optional alias of first initial last name, whatever naming convention they choose. When they leave office, everything gets archived, the account purged, reset, and is ready for the next person to hold the seat.""  But, like in the private world, IT will inevitably buckle under the pressure of the Type A ""my way"" personalities and just do it. It's why I talk to IT admins on occasion that need help routing their CEO's traffic around a filtering proxy so the boss can watch porn at work. Or figuring out how to auto-relay all of their email to someone's AOL or GMAIL address.  Maybe a referendum is needed to force it to play out in our favor.  Personally, if I were in office, I'd want a separate official email box that was being appropriately archived. Anything related to my position would go there, and only there. Because I'd rather not have my personal emails subject to a records request. That's why I have a dozen or so email accounts now, it's a pain in the ass but it keeps each item's business silo'd appropriately."

We've voted 17 Democrats and 12 Republicans into governorship in the past century, and have had a Democrat governor for 22 of the last 30 years. We trend towards Republican for President, but until recently Republicans have tended to push for smaller government.  Thing is, we're a very independent state, and we like to vote for people who will do the most to, generally speaking, leave us alone. Recently, with a few exceptions, that's been Dems. But when those Democrats extended their reach too far there were recalls. This can be seen further in our typical voter initiatives that restrict the power of the state's government.  Read through the Wikipedia article for a semi-decent understanding. We're not all the same, obviously, but I like to think that people live here because they enjoy being independent.

However, technically....  ""If you recently established Colorado residency, you have 90 days to register your vehicle and obtain Colorado license plates.  The state defines residency as:    You own or operate a business within Colorado.  You've resided in Colorado for 90 days.  You work in Colorado.   If you do not register your vehicle within the required 90 days, the state will issue a late fee""  It wasn't enforced when it took me 4 months to do mine but it can be enforced as soon as they can determine you are a resident and own a car.  Back in Virginia people would report each other as it is kinda like evading taxes."
Colorado,35gbf2,jafnharr,4,Sun May 10 02:28:21 2015 UTC,"To answer your questions:  Yes, you have to register your car, eventually.  You do not have to register your car when you get your drivers license.  In fact, they can't even be done at the same location.  Go to the DMV and get your license.  Now you are a CO resident.  Yay.  Register to vote too.   Now, per https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dmv/registration-requirements, once you become a resident, you have to register your vehicle within 90 days.  So, you can delay paying the CO registration fees, but not for long."
Colorado,35gbf2,ndrew452,3,Sun May 10 16:12:46 2015 UTC,"If it's your car then yeah, you're supposed to register it here in CO.  It's pretty minor if you've already paid sales tax for the purchase.

Colorado,35gbf2,SeanMoore,2,Sun May 10 09:05:51 2015 UTC,"My gf just went through this whole process to get in-state tuition (however, she actually did move here permanently, which makes it easier to do)  It's a long arduous process, and you have to be able to prove that you intend to stay here after you graduate and you aren't doing this to get in-state tuition.  It's pretty much at the discretion of the tuition classification officer, so you just have to meet as much of the criteria as you can and hope they have mercy on you. I actually sent in my job offer and a copy of our joint lease with her in-state tuition petition to help prove she moved here permanently with me.    Even if you go back home just for the summer, they won't give you in-state. If you have a job outside of Colorado, that will disqualify you. You pretty much need a job through the year in Colorado to prove you're here all the time.  Using a dorm as an address would also probably look bad to the tuition classification officer.  If the car isn't registered to you than I doubt you would need to do that, but if it is, you definitely need to register it if you want to have a shot.  Legally you don't need to register your car in CO if you are just here for the purpose of going to school  Also, you have to be at least 23 or be emancipated from your parents (hard to do), and there will be a full year between when you start the process, until you are actually eligible to get in-state tuition."

Either way Driver's License and vehicle registrations are handled by different offices in Colorado so expect to make a couple trips.  Selling a car with in state tags is easier though as the buyer won't have to do all the work associated with buying an out of state car. The job along with living here more than 50% of the year help establish your legal residency.  The only issue you might run into is if you're still claimed as a dependent by someone.

That's because women are federally recognized as being a minority group for tax purposes and legal protection. Augusta National is able to discriminate based on gender because it is a private club, not because it is a private business or organization as you contend. There's a difference.  When a bar or club gives a free drink to women during a Ladies Night, they are giving a discount to minorities. I'm not sure why you can wrap your feeble mind around that. You can say it's unconstitutional/illegal all you want, but on almost any night of the week, a woman can get a free drink in a Denver bar/club simply because of her gender.

Colorado,3566q1,PrincessLolipop,18,Thu May 7 17:22:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The idea that it represents ""heritage"" is fucking retarded. It represents an attempt to secede from the country because you want to keep slavery legal. What else could it possibly mean?"

None the less, this symbol is associated oppression of African Americans in addition for the right to secede form the union. http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23705803 Understandably so, this may upset people who have fought for racial equality in the United States.

Colorado,3566q1,scoder,-19,Thu May 7 15:12:12 2015 UTC,Or. Maybe an overprotective society who is too worried about political correctness? I have a Confederate flag. I do not support slavery by any means. Most people thing the flag stands for slavery. During the Civil War it stood for those men who were willing to die for a right they believed in. It stood for the right to secede from the union. The same thing that our founding fathers stood for.
Colorado,3566q1,End_Life_2012,19,Thu May 7 14:05:02 2015 UTC,During the Civil War it stood for those men who were willing to die for a right they believed in.

Colorado,3566q1,CapHillStrangler,-4,Thu May 7 14:26:21 2015 UTC,It's not a lost point but SLAVERY is a NEGATIVE thing for people that experience it/had family that went through it and that's why people are upset.
Colorado,3566q1,NitroJesus4000,5,Thu May 7 16:41:21 2015 UTC,"I am not sure I get your point. You are saying that because we were not slaves ourselves, we shouldnt dislike this?"
Colorado,3566q1,End_Life_2012,-4,Thu May 7 16:51:37 2015 UTC,"No, I did not even state my opinion regarding that you should or shouldn't like to confederate flag. I am saying that while it has a meaning representing the right to secede from the United States people are upset because it is also associated with slavery/oppression."
Colorado,3566q1,DeviatedNorm,6,Thu May 7 16:37:59 2015 UTC,"Gotcha... that makes sense... but it also stating the obvious. My stance is that people who go around sporting Nazi armbands are universally hated, so why should confederate flag wavers be surprised when people are upset at them flying that flag. That flag doesnt even make sense in Colorado anyway, which was frontier territory land in the time of the Civil War."
Colorado,3566q1,End_Life_2012,1 point,Thu May 7 16:57:48 2015 UTC,:D haha yeah I have the tendency to do so and ahhh I thought you were confused about why people were anti confederate flag. Sorry for assuming so!
Colorado,3566q1,DeviatedNorm,10,Thu May 7 17:02:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, I have to hang it to you, I was about to judge you when you said you have a confederate flag but when you said you don't support slavery - I admit I realized how judgmental I am.  Consider me pwned (or however you snazzy internet kids say it), you are truly a shining light of humanity."
Colorado,3566q1,End_Life_2012,-6,Thu May 7 17:06:26 2015 UTC,"Actually, if you must know. The Georgia Pig had it and it was their original flag from when they opened. I had been going to that place since I was a kid and when they closed the owner gave it to me. The symbolism it holds for me is nothing more than a memory of every time I went to North Carolina with my family. They served the best pulled pork and amazing ribs."
Colorado,3566q1,DeviatedNorm,10,Thu May 7 17:08:10 2015 UTC,"So the flag symbolizes a positive time in your life and memories of a restaurant you liked a lot and that's fine. But just because you see the flag that way doesn't mean that's how everybody else sees it and for many people that flag is only associated with negative events in history. Things symbolize different things for different people so don't act like nobody should be upset at the sight of a confederate flag because for a lot of people it doesn't make them think back to family vacations, it makes them think of slavery."

Colorado,3566q1,CapHillStrangler,2,Thu May 7 17:20:09 2015 UTC,"And that is also the sad thing about the rebel flag & bbq (Maurice's in Columbia, SC used to fly it too), by marketing bbq restaurants with the rebel flag as many rural white owned establishments in the south do it undermines the diverse history of the food.  Barbecue is a mixture of Native American, West African & European culinary styles & many of the great smoke cooks have been Black.  The big problem I have with the rebel flag, besides the history, is that the 'heritage excuse' is even a worse excuse - there would not be any 'heritage' if it weren't for African slaves & their descendants.  White people have no ownership over the south or its history, food or music.  Unfortunately what makes the south so unique, is the same thing that divides it & that is what that stupid flag represents."

Colorado,3566q1,MattD420,-11,Thu May 7 18:02:05 2015 UTC,"I whole heartily agree. Even the Swastika has its origins.   http://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/symbol-swastika-and-its-12000-year-old-history-001312  Just because it's been used as a symbol of hate by people does not mean it can not have its other meanings. I do understand that it may hold hate for some, but it may be uplifting to others. I would never ask a Jew who survived the Holocaust to think of it in any other way than hatred. I would also never ask a Buddhist Monk to think of it in hatred. This is where I personally believe ""political correctness"" fails miserably."
Colorado,3566q1,Fofolito,9,Thu May 7 17:55:09 2015 UTC,"If this kid was holding a giant Swastika flag, would you be saying the same thing?  Political correctness is one thing, but these symbols hold very negative connotations that reflect poorly on anyone carrying them."
Colorado,3566q1,MattD420,-9,Thu May 7 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"I would argue the same thing if he was holding a Swastika, if it wasn't the one Hitler used. If it was a Native American headdress with the Swastika on it or a Buddha head with the same symbol, yes."

Edit - There is better discussion here than anything you will read above despite the attempt to suppress it with downvotes!
Colorado,3566q1,CapHillStrangler,63,Thu May 7 17:46:39 2015 UTC,The flag represents slavery and treason and nothing else.
Colorado,3566q1,brodie7838,42,Sun May 10 23:02:24 2015 UTC,"Just because a bunch of people in the south, that live over 100 years after the civil war, say that the flag represents ""heritage""... doesn't make it true. That flag is bullshit. If they had flown the stars and stripes... there would have been no issue. Parents teaching their kids this ""not hate, heritage"" shit is the problem. That is a false ideal. Unless you lived during that time, you have no reason to respect the confederate flag at all."
Colorado,3566q1,O_Cressida,-32,Mon May 11 14:45:49 2015 UTC,http://www.usflag.org/confederate.stars.and.bars.html   It's because of people like you that the flag has its meaning.
Colorado,3566q1,RyanSmith,24,Tue May 12 02:19:04 2015 UTC,"That's how meaning happens, dude.  A group of people agree upon something and then that's what it means.  There's no logical reason why some red with some blue stripes and some white stars would represent ""heritage"" or ""slavery"", there's no logical reason why a flag would represent either or anything at all.  But it does because as a society we've agreed that at minimum, it represents something.  And if you know that a huge population is going to interpret things differently than you intend, why the heck aren't you being clearer with your communication?  You can't change how people interpret things you communicate, but you can change how you communicate."
Colorado,3566q1,MattD420,-9,Tue May 12 13:12:36 2015 UTC,"That's true. Without knowing if they (they being the kids in the photo) are part of the KKK or racist then to them it could mean something entirely different. I am just personally upset the mom did what she did. Instead of that, teach your kids. (On a personal note, I do not believe it was meant to be a racist photo)"
Colorado,3566q1,MattD420,15,Wed May 13 05:28:48 2015 UTC,"“I had previously seen one of the kids he hangs out with hanging that flag in the back of his truck, and we warned our son. We said, ‘Do you know what this means?’ and he said, ‘It just means pro-country, Southern stuff,’ and we said, ‘No, it means a lot more than that — it can be considered racist, and it’s going to bring out a lot of emotions, so don’t go close to that.’”   Did I miss something? The only mom that's really pertinent in this story did try to educate her kid.  ""It can be racist"" even fits your narrative of ""omg it also can not be racist"".  What did mom do that you're upset about?"
Colorado,3566q1,brodie7838,-13,Tue Jun 2 16:48:52 2015 UTC,"Instead of saying ""stay away from that stuff"", educate him on why it could be racist. Educate him on why it's not. Just don't say ""stay away""."
Colorado,3566q1,MattD420,11,Thu May 7 14:59:55 2015 UTC,That's a lot of judgement based on a lack of details coming from someone who's so eager that we all keep an open mind to the other sides of the story for this flag.  Maybe mom did explain things to her son and the author of the article didn't note it?  Or mom didn't explain to the journalist that she'd explained things to her son?  Maybe this conversation came up at a really inopportune time and a long discussion on this nation's history wasn't viable?

Colorado,3566q1,TotesMessenger,49,Thu May 7 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"You don't have to agree to shit. The history speaks for itself. This flag is more technically called the Battle Standard of the Confederacy from which we can safely say it directly represented forces in open rebellion against the United States Government and its people. These forces represented a group of elite plantation owners, businessmen, and racist/biggoted white men who were fighting for their right to hold other human beings in bonded servitude. The whole ""States' Rights"" argument attempts to white wash the true beginnings and causes of the American Civil War. Displaying the Cefederate Battle Standard is a statement of supporting those ideals: that black men and women are not truly human beings, that every white man should have the right to own slaves and to profit from their labor, and be free of the Federal Government's influence.  That flag represents Slavery and Treason."
Colorado,3566q1,ld115,-43,Thu May 7 17:14:14 2015 UTC,public schooling at its finest on display here
Colorado,3566q1,MrMoustachio,26,Thu May 7 17:16:11 2015 UTC,"Sure, I went to public school. I attended with individuals of Asian heratige, Blacks, Hispanics, Whites, and there were even Native American kids at my first school. Why the life story? Because I attended a tax-payer funded public school with individuals of skin color. Do you think that would have been possible at any point during the Confederacy's rebellion or subsequent history? No, because the primary factor driving their rebellion from the Federal Government was their economic and racist need to exploit a very specific population for their labor. That's a simplification, sure, but to devolve into issues of States's Rights is a side show to the real problem. The Southern States wanted to be able to self-determine if they could slavery and wanted out from under the thumb of the Federal Government that was ever increasingly approaching abolishing the practice. They wanted a southern man to be President, not Lincoln, because he would protect the rights of slavers to own slaves. The southern states wanted to form a Confederate Government to keep the power in the hands of the States to protect the rights of slavers to-- this is getting repetitive... Own slaves.   There's no way around this fact. The Confederate Battle Standard stands for Treason and Slavery. If you display that flag you are making a statement loud and clear for the rest of us just like if you were to display the Flag of the Third Riech."

Colorado,359ejn,Luis_Toro,3,Fri May 8 22:07:00 2015 UTC,"Well, the bill says that along every stage of development the fetuses/embryos are people and therefore the killing of a fetus/embryo would murder, except in the case of medication side-effects (or intent, RU-86), something the mother does (natural miscarriage, accident causing loss of fetus, etc), or a physician at the mother's request (surgical/medical abortion).  However, the fear is that simply defining ""person"" to be anything from conception beyond may eventually lead to those exceptions being removed and then abortion would be legally murder."

Colorado,34xzmv,SteelChicken,12,Tue May 5 14:40:52 2015 UTC,"In short, TABOR requires any tax increases to be put to a vote before they can be implemented.  Ultimately, this has put the state in a position where it now levvies fees left and right, because they can't generate any new income through taxes.

Essentially they were pulled over for a cracked windshield. I see those daily on tons of cars in this state. I don't see anyone getting arrested for it. Is inadequate insurance coverage a felony? In Florida, another state with compulsory insurance coverage laws, it's a ticket until you can prove you have coverage or not.

In each case the officers were professional and polite, but completely useless.  * a few years ago my 80+ year old grandparents moved from their detached home into a condo. They paid a moving company to haul their stuff over. About halfway through unloading into the new place, the movers close the door on the truck trailer and padlock it. They demand an extra $800 to unload the rest of it or they'll take it back with them and eventually sell it at auction. My grandpa calls the cops and an officer comes out. He asks to see the contract and the movers pull it out for show - the contract is now covered in whiteout and handwritten ""corrections"" that haven't been initialed by anyone, certainly not my grandpa. The officer agrees that what these guys are doing is illegal, but informs us that to resolve anything we'll have to take it up with a civil suit to get his stuff back. Effectively a robbery/extortion in progress and the cop won't do anything.  I've never had interaction where I witnessed, first hand, police being evil...

For example a flea bite can lead to infection of the glands, which is called bubonic plague -- notorious for the epidemics it spawned during the Middle Ages in Europe. Because this plague was spread from dog to owner through coughing, it developed into pneumonic plague, according to Douglas.  The plague is known to be endemic to prairie dogs in the American Southwest, which can then lead to isolated outbreaks of the disease in domestic animals or humans."

On a serious note- birthcontrol is a good way to prevent pregnancies and abortions. I don't get why some pro-life conservatives are so against it. And if people want society to have less abortions, increased access to birthcontrol can help. That might mean public money should go to BC.  However, you can agree with everything I am saying (or parts of it) and still think government monies are better spent elsewhere. Those people can care about women too. Some don't, but some do. its a complicated issue that often is more about economics & government size then it is about how one feels about women or health."
Colorado,34ekuj,Autodidact2,4,Thu Apr 30 21:18:57 2015 UTC,They're not actually anti-abortion at all. They are anti-women having sex without negative repercussions.
Colorado,34ekuj,longtimecompanda,4,Thu Apr 30 20:50:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think some are. Maybe a lot are subconsciously. There is also a good amount of misinformation. Some think birth control causes abortions.  Unfortunately many pro-lifers automatically wont listen to certain facts because they ""come from liberals"" This is basically why I think everyone should stop demonizing the other side, so that calm rational facts will be listened to. Conservatives wont listen to medical studies, no matter how correct they are, if they are coming from the same people who say ""you are all misogynist who hate women"" because they personally don't believe they do hate women, even if their actions seem to say the contrary."
Colorado,34ekuj,grundyhippie,4,Fri May 1 14:33:15 2015 UTC,"Here's what you need to get: Fundies want ALL women under their control, because wymmins iz ebbull.

TL;DR: this is punishment for wymmins having sexy time. Good Christian Women do not enjoy sex, is what they claim, but the fundies in Colorado Springs just want to punish poor women for enjoying their own bodies. To teach them who is in charge, you see."
Colorado,34ekuj,longtimecompanda,2,Fri May 1 16:29:19 2015 UTC,"Im not entirely sure if you are being sarcastic, but I respectively disagree.  Fundies believe God made women separate from men and that women have a different set of skills, abilities and objectives compared to men. They believe women are best as mothers and keepers of the home. They do not hate women. The think they are a different brand of human. (not that it matters, but I disagree with this completely)   They think abortion is murder.   Since they believe women are natural mothers, and abortion is the murder of babies, they believe abortion hurts mothers- they believe that it deeply hurts the mother to commit a murder and that it is unnatural to their basic being. Also, they are obviously concerned about the loss of life.  They dont hate women. They think women are different than men and that abortions are harmful to women, and that life of the baby has more value than this particular choice a woman has.   Just like how fundies and conservatives wont listen to arguments of fetal age, conscience, social systems, health concerns, etc. because MURDER!!! Liberals must be cautions of ignoring arguments because CONSERVATIVES HATE WOMEN!!!!  When both sides demonize the other, nothing gets done. Both sides (generally) want what is best for society. Conservatives are talking about what life is, liberals are talking about freedoms individuals should have. These are two different concepts and as long as one side demonizes the other (both are guilty) we will never get on a playing field to even begin talking about the issue at hand."

They do their evil in secret, where only their victims see, so you'll keep seeing them as benign and well-meaning, and because who would believe a woman/gay person/child over a respected deacon or preacher?  I dislike fantasy. Political or otherwise. There are people out there who hate others due to gender/religion/blah blah blah.

The belief system can absolutely allow those who truly hate women to flourish. The literal interpretations of the bible fundies tend to use to can really create an environment that is negative to women and can open the door for abuse, physical mental and emotional. No, I believe evil people exist, and I think extremist religions hold a high percent of evil people.  However, I don't believe 47% of Americans who are pro-life are evil people who truly hate women. I think a majority of those who are pro-life believe a fetus is equivalent to a baby and see issues with abortion because of that. Or they fall into the group i mentioned above. A little more conservative, but think they are doing what is best for their women. There are also plenty of pro-life women and secular pro-lifers.   Maybe our disagreement is a more broad one- I do believe there are more good people than bad people in the world.   Anyway, to my first point, you can be completely pro-choice and pro- birth control for whatever reason, but still see issues with government spending."

It's not healthy or wise to have all the babies your body could possibly make. And I'm betting that the great majority of these wierdos don't have 15 kids. When did birth control get controversial??"
Colorado,34ekuj,O_Cressida,2,Fri May 1 00:10:24 2015 UTC,"Birth control got controversial once the ""religious right"" became a thing. Condoning birth control is the same as condoning sex for purposes other than procreation. Because it's so ineffective to simply shame people for having sex for fun rather than for procreation, the religious right has lately decided to ignore science and ""believe"" that birth control actually causes ""abortions"" because, well, by golly, they ""believe"" that life begins at fertilization, and it's possible (as in, it's within the realm of earthly possibilities, not that it's common or proven) that some forms of contraceptives prevent fertilized eggs from implanting in the uterine wall.   So, now, we have a lot of right-wingers who use their ill-founded -- but somehow ""deeply felt"" -- beliefs about how birth control works, how pregnancy and abortion are defined, and when ""life"" begins to drive their politics, at least regarding this type of legislation. The recent Hobby Lobby SCOTUS decision is a great example of the attitudes and beliefs that bring us to where we are now: we can't offer low-income teenagers long-term, highly effective contraceptives at a reduced price or for free with government funds because 1) some anti-science people ""believe"" that IUDs cause abortions; 2) the government shouldn't be paying for people to ""have sex""; and 3) young women who have unsanctioned sex should have to face consequences for their sins in the form of bearing children they don't want and can't afford."

What does it say about the college co-ed Susan Fluke [sic], who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex, what does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex.   And as for childbirth as a punishment, it's pretty well-known that in Christianity, painful childbirth is God's punishment for Eve's sins. It's not too difficult to extrapolate a modern viewpoint from that tenet where women who have unsanctioned sex (e.g., before/outside of marriage, for lust rather than love, for fun rather than procreation) ought to ""face the consequences"" of that action by giving birth."

We share the cost of keeping the poor healthy and not having unplanned children, so we don't end up with STDs spread throughout our communities ( many rich people sleep with poor people, contrary to any fantasy that the rich are somehow not tainted by disease in the community ) and we are all healthier as a result.

The government protects our right to choice and not dictate choices upon us, except in very limited areas...life liberty pursuit of blah blah...you get the picture. We just don't agree, and thats fine, we both want a better world and are actively trying the best we can to help.  I work in private equity, and people hate my business based on the Bernie Madoffs and such. But who was looking after Mr. Madoff for the 30 years he was running that gimmick? Read the words from his own mouth right HERE. The government you want to regulate poor womens health couldn't figure out that he stole 65 billion??? They never once checked to verify he owned a single security? The SEC never ONCE visited his auditor/accountants office that never had enough staff to actually do the accounting work for a 65b fund? Those investors, some of which have taken their own lives after losing their life savings, should be equally upset with the SEC as they are Madoff.  The three owners of my firm have created a charity. Without it, over 1,400 poor Denver kids would have been left in dire situations with broken households and many other  extreme circumstances. They work with the local school districts and teachers to nominate students who have no resources and need help and have shown a willingness or desire to succeed. Who are then put in tutoring programs, counseling, private school the works, people in their house with them several times a week. They now graduate college at a 98% clip, including Harvard and the like. All 100% free, no gimmicks. They have further changed the lives of everyone in their communities by proving it can be done and becoming someone positive to look up to. While the government schools are working at an 80% clip in HIGH SCHOOL, and a measly 33% for college. Look at the poor neighborhoods and those statistics getting horrifyingly worse. The 1,400 kids and all their children will never again live in conditions they grew up in. They have brothers and sisters who have made huge turn arounds in life after just knowing someone whos done it. They now have newly opened divisions in three other states...the success is overwhelming. This year we have 114 scholars.  I'm not your enemy...keep that in mind. I want better, I'm willing to pay for it, and I'm willing to work for it. Instead of telling me why I'm wrong, explain to me why the government is right...keep it positive at a minimum."

I do feel strongly that we should prevent recreational use in that population, though. I know that's not being proposed, but taking this idea any further could be a slippery slope.

Colorado,33zyvp,SkullCollector,2,Mon Apr 27 23:17:09 2015 UTC,"You obviously don't understand what I'm saying.  He was probably never aiming for heads in the first place -- he was just trying to hit cars -- to hit a moving car AT ALL is hard enough (depending on range/skill/etc, of course)... so he probably wasn't lining people's heads up in his crosshairs.  He was just aiming for the car in general.  If he's lucky/good enough to hit a car at all, the likelihood of hitting a person inside is relatively high.    So it doesn't matter if you tint your windows.  He only needed to see the car to begin with -- and tinting windows doesn't make your car invisible.    Not only that but even if he was actually shooting at that small of a target, it's not like tinting windows makes you wonder where the driver sits, right?  Just shoot at the (tinted) front driver's side window. DUH."

Colorado,33zyvp,Kidoppay,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:04:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't down vote you. But I will answer your question as to theoretically why someone might be opposed to tracking ammo as you say.   One, ammo is absurdly easy to make. Many people make their own even casting their own lead. It isn't a commodity that lends itself well to be tracked.  Two, many people feel that history has been pretty clear what happens when every little thing about civilian owned weaponry gets tracked: Sooner or later the lists made for good intentions get severely abused. Some people feel that an armed populace is one less likely to have their freedoms taken away and they see anything which could be used to remove that safety net as a huge concern. Now to many this argument seems far fetched, or perhaps even a result of misaligned priorities, but really that all depends on what your values are and what's most important to you."

It ignores that two psychiatrists diagnosed him as sane see 1:24 pm in this link  I really wish 'journalists' would put in an ounce of effort.  After all, the journalist could have cited the suicide attempt in James' early teens or perhaps how he told a friend he was bad news.  Maybe the journalist could actually link the gun club owner remarks.  Besides- the 'creeped out' claim is a bit far.  He does state that the guy was strange, but that was followed by, ""Who says 'cheers?'""  And that his voicemail was like somebody trying to be as weird as possible.  I found this stuff pretty easily- Heck, a trip to wikipedia and a few more clicks did it for me- granted the article you decided to link was from 2012, where the writer was just writing clickbait because it was a hot topic and info was scarce, so people were just throwing together crappy articles with questionable sources."

He also supposedly has a family history of schizophrenia with both his grandfathers and his aunt suffering from the illness. So him creeping out the gun range owner is definitely not ""the only argument he was mentally ill"". There seems to be ample evidence to suggest that he's disturbed.   Pretty sure too that the claim that he was declared sane is misleading. He was declared fit to stand trial. That doesn't mean he's sane.   Tbh, I think almost everyone closely involved with this court case knows exactly what's going on with him mentally, they just want to milk it for everything it's worth."

I also do not know why you say what the NRA would tell me.  I am getting the implied sense, based off your language, that you are not in the NRA- which suggests you are not a policy-making member of the NRA- and therefore you do not know what the NRA would tell me in this circumstance.  If you can grab proof of your claim against the NRA instead of baseless accusations I would gladly consider it.    Additionally, if I were reading this from your perspective I (you) would assume that I (me) am a member of the NRA.  I (me) am not, I do not own a gun.

Maybe I am making a mistake in trusting professionals to be adept in their profession, to the point that they may make an accurate assessment of a person's mental state.  Maybe you are making a mistake into jumping to conclusions based on your experiences.  Let's move to a bit of a tangential question though.  Timothy McVeigh- was he insane?  I do not think so.

Colorado,33pwxw,inshambles,7,Fri Apr 24 17:52:59 2015 UTC,"In that case, I would say probably not. What could you do? In the case of allowing customers to carry guns inside the theater, the die-hard gun carriers were ignoring the rules already, I'd imagine (though that would be purely speculation), since someone in the thread said they aren't legally binding.  Mass shooters tend to go for high population, low security locations. We shouldn't make every area high security because it would probably just increase public stress and anxiety and most likely wouldn't lower the already rare instances of gunmen.  There's nothing the theater could have done. You can't spot treat this kind of thing."

I know in Georgia they don't carry force-of-law, but if the venue asks you to leave on account of your gun you have to our you are trespassing.  The exceptions to this rule are of course things like bars, court houses, schools, etc..."

Colorado,33pwxw,LittleBigHorn22,2,Fri Apr 24 19:30:27 2015 UTC,"True, having more guns in the general public will increase accidents; however, increase education on how to properly use guns will reduce accidents, and if more people are carrying them there may be a reduction in mass shootings.  Just how teenagers going to driver education schools and having involved parents statistically get in fewer accidents.   Since it is impossible to either ban all guns or prevent people with criminal attitudes from obtaining guns.  The only solution seems to be for an increase in education across the board so people know how to use and have a better respect for guns.  I am frustrated because whatever we have been doing for the past fifty years hasn't seemed to help in reducing mass shootings."

Colorado,33pwxw,MrMoustachio,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:51:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, but guns ARE designed to kill people.  By ""protect,"" I assume you mean kill or injure an attacker.  Sometimes that is the best option and will save more lives than the anything else, but that doesn't change the fact that they are designed to kill."
Colorado,33pwxw,Eclectix,4,Sat Apr 25 02:02:24 2015 UTC,"By ""protect,"" I assume you mean kill or injure an attacker.   Not at all. In the majority of cases when a gun is used in defense, no shots are fired. Guns (by which I assume you're talking about hand guns rather than guns designed for hunting for instance) are designed for defense. They do this job better than any other tool, which is why cops still carry them even though they also have other tools which also are designed for defense."
Colorado,33pwxw,Eclectix,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:11:12 2015 UTC,"Good points, but I believe the reason ""defense style"" guns can be used as a deterrent without being fired is because they are designed to have the potential to kill.  A car or kitchen knife is just as deadly as a gun if used improperly, but people don't choose to keep cars or kitchen knives in their homes purely for defense.  I guess the point I am trying to make is that guns can act as a deterrent even without being fired because they can be used and are designed to kill.  If used properly in the right hands they can be a valuable tool, but the reason they are useful is because they are designed to be deadly to humans or animals.  Otherwise why not just keep a Taser or pepper spray for defense?"
Colorado,33pwxw,Eclectix,3,Sat Apr 25 03:15:50 2015 UTC,"See my police analogy above. Police are not hired specifically for the purpose of killing or putting people in jail. They are hired to keep the peace. The way they do that is with the threat of killing (with their guns) or arresting people and putting them in jail. But nobody would argue that killing and jailing are what police are designed (or in their case hired) for, or that killing and arresting people is their intended purpose.   Guns are exactly the same. Just because they accomplish their purpose through the potential to hurt or kill does not mean that this is their intended purpose or that they were designed specifically for that reason. If they were, then they were poorly designed because you can kill people much more effectively with far simpler devices. They were designed specifically for the purpose of defense.  As for pepper spray and Tasers, there is a reason why police carry guns as well as those items. It's because they are simply not as effective at defense and deterrent as guns are."
Colorado,33pwxw,Elethor,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:25:27 2015 UTC,"A police officer is trained and has the power to kill/fine/arrest people.  While their intended purpose is to keep the peace, they do so because they are ""designed"" to arrest/fine/kill like you mentioned, by their training.  A gun is also designed and intended to kill even if that may not be their primary purpose.  I think we're agreeing here, its just a matter of what something accomplishes, and how it is designed to accomplish it."

I hope people are not buying guns for that reason, that would be a shame.   But they are still designed to kill people.    Using them to shoot random people in a theater is a misuse of the product.   Then they should be more selective about who they sell their people killers to, right?"
Colorado,33pwxw,Elethor,8,Sat Apr 25 00:31:13 2015 UTC,"But they are still designed to kill people.    By this logic, police are trained to kill people. You're more likely to be killed by a cop if you call one. Better get rid of cops; we'll all be much safer."

The fact that they can also do other things is moot, because as others have already pointed out, guns can be and are used for other things, too. Their primary purpose is to protect people. This is literally why police carry and train with them. When you call the police for assistance, you are putting out a request for someone who is trained to kill to come and assist you, guns and all.  You don't shoot a gun to hammer in a nail.

There was also a breakthrough in modern psychiatry just a few months ago, stating that we actually have psychiatric treatment reversed, and are making drugs that do the complete opposite of what they were meant to, because someone mixed up the science.

First they'll be blown all over and the elements will shred them. The UV from the sun will breakdown the glue in the binding, and any sort of plastic sheen on the cover (more common on hardcovers, but also on kids paperbacks). So now there's all that crap blowing around.  Then after some windy and/or wet days, the glue will completely give out and the pages will fly off the books. Let's say each book is roughly 200 pages, so 100 pieces of paper PER BOOK flying across normally-green fields, jamming up waterways and drainage's, blowing across the road like a mini-snowstorm of trash.  After 10-20yrs it should be mostly gone, just flakes of paper and some old fiber-bound bindings blowing about. You're right... nothing to be concerned about."

Colorado,33mfne,Ghostalker474,8,Thu Apr 23 18:35:07 2015 UTC,"It'd be unfortunate to lose the caucus.  Caucuses are lengthy, annoying, and a waste of at least one full day (and a Saturday at that).  The caucus is a pain in the ass.  But the caucus offers a level of grassroots, direct participation, in-your-face political activism so often romanticized by reddit that the primary process can't even come close to.  We should do away with the caucus because most people don't have the energy?  I'd rather leave democracy in the hands of the, say, 40,000 citizen voters most motivated to participate in the arduous caucus process than have the slate of candidates (and only the most entrenched party loyalists at that) approved by the closed-door nomination process of the party leadership.  The caucus process forces you to meet your neighbors in your district, IN PERSON, and discuss the candidates and the issues directly with your district delegation.  It also coerces the state Republican and Democrat parties to develop their platforms around a wider swath of opinions, where the input of more moderate or previously unaffiliated voters can mitigate and centralize extremism within the party.  Each individual person can be of the most influence via the caucus process.  In the primary process, your influence vanishes.  The primary process is as follows: register Democrat or Republican, mail your vote in.  Easy as pie!  The ballot is pre-selected for you, unilaterally by the party leadership, and if you don't like anybody, maybe you'll write somebody in.  And the official party platform would already be decided upon by that time without you (unless you're on your city's chapter of the Republican/Democrat party's email distro and you actually filled out a surveymonkey, and the party leadership was actually swayed by the data.)  ""Voter turnout"" is the metric by which it is argued that the Primary is successful and the Caucus system is outmoded.  Obviously, there's a higher turnout!  It's much easier to check a box and mail it than actually involve yourself in the political process (and more enticing!)  But what kind of successful democratic selection process diminishes the influence of the earnest voters most willing to participate?  The only barrier to influencing the political scape in the Caucus system is YOU.  If legislators wanna superficially craft Colorado to be the political momentum-shifting juggernaut that it isn't, they could just reschedule the caucus to be right after Iowa's.  Or, probably equally effective, change the name of the state to New Maine."

Colorado,33hfv2,ld115,2,Wed Apr 22 17:20:40 2015 UTC,"Problem is how do you determine that?  My brother was told to draw what he wanted in an art class on his art portfolio so he drew skeletons. They weren't scary, they were comical in depiction and held a sign that said ""Skeletons are were people too."" My parents were called up after that because he drew ""comical"" death situations. Not the act of death, but cartoon-y death related things like skeletons and Death himself.  In my English class, they had a writing experiment where they showed us a weird picture and we were suppose to write a short story on it. One picture showed a guy on a chair looking angrily at a bump under the carpet in the floor. So my story was around how noisy neighbors below wouldn't leave him in peace so when the noise of the bump woke him up he took a shovel to it as revenge and the carpet became wet. When he removed it he realized he had pummeled a dude's head and killed him.  I had to go to the principal's office after that and explain why I wrote that as a story.   The quiet ones do need talking to sometimes, yes, but with the regulation and fear that would come out of this, at best kids would be escorted from classes or called to the office. At worst cops would do the escorting. Neither of these cases would help the kids that need it. Those that don't need it, the introverts who were already weird would be further outcasts at their own school which could cause them to become one of those unstable quiet ones."

Colorado,339a2x,MrMoustachio,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:10:56 2015 UTC,"Typically 99% of motorcycle clubs are law abiding. 1% aren't. You can find a list of many of the clubs here on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_outlaw_motorcycle_clubs Typically when you see patches on the back of a motorcyclist's leather jacket there can be up to 3 (sometimes 4-5) on the back denoting their club. The more patches you have the more hardcore you are and typically this is the closer you are to being a 1% club. If you intent to start a new motorcycle club usually you have to talk to the top club in the state, in the case of colorado, that's HA. If you don't register with the top club you can find your self in a world of hurt quick if your not careful.   Typically the top patch is the clubs name. A 1 piece club is completely harmless, this would be like if a group of firefighters or teachers or  something went on regular cruses or something.  The bottom patch is usually where the club is from (IE: Colorado, Germany, New Zealand, ect..) The middle patch is usually the groups colors. If someone has colors/3 piece that means their in all the way and have made it though all their trials to fully join the club. If its a 1% club this may have involved 'doing work.'   Typically its not in your best best interest fuck with anyone over 3 patches. Buy em a drink maybe and hangout, but don't overstay your welcome. 2 other small patches you may see are MC denoting motorcycle club and 99% or 1%. Obviously you don't wanna fuck with anyone that has a 1%. Again if a group has certain patches its because its okay with the head club. If someone a group is riding around without permission wearing a 3 piece i'd hate to think what would happen to them.   The most notable Colorado 1% club is the 'sons of science'.  If you see their patch give them space and i wouldn't even really recommend even talking to them. Their known to be one of the most violent and hardcore biker gangs in the entire world biased originally out of niwot. I've met a few guys affiliated with them in my travels and they all seemed cool, but their reputation precedes them.

Colorado,338tf4,Unit248,2,Tue Apr 21 01:44:31 2015 UTC,It's also a federally funded institution and weed is still illegal at the federal level.
Colorado,338tf4,dancingmanatee,0,Wed Apr 22 04:26:48 2015 UTC,"No it is not. The federal government doesn't run any colleges or universities except for the service academies.   The University of Colorado is a state funded college, which at least part of their funding from the state. Although with the recent rate hikes tuition/fees provide a large amount of that funding as well."

No one every drinks, has sex, discovers that they would rather get an art degree rather than a business degree, or drops out and invents Facebook. Without encouraging free expression universities run the risk of suppressing individual thought and forcing everyone to simply toe the proverbial line.   The best outcome of a college experience is the development of the whole person, cultivation of creativity, maturation of social and cultural sensibilities, and even increased passion for life, learning and civic engagement of all sorts — what collectively might be called “life and citizenship knowledge.” Calling for the police to write trespassing tickets for an event your don't agree with is the suppression of these ideals.    I personally don't smoke pot but I think it is great for young adults to be exposed to pot. The same way I think it is good that they are exposed to different political beliefs, alcohol, staying up late, and sexual experiences.  Events such as these help mold people into well rounded individuals who have learned to balance and take into moderation all aspects of life."
Colorado,338tf4,Unit248,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"I don't often comment on things like this, but I feel like giving my two cents.  I went to Boulder, did the 4/20 back in the day, now I'm graduated and moved on.  For me it was always a protest.  Even with decriminalized and medical marijuana it was still an illegal schedule 1 substance.  Nowadays, Colorado has got legal pot.  Good for us, mission accomplished.  No need to smoke on the quad anymore.    What I want to see are 4/20 protests in Nebraska and Kansas, even DC to get it reclassified as a lower schedule drug.    I think 4/20 served its purpose and was more than just a big dope smoking party, even if a lot of people treated it as such.  So closing it down seems a little draconian, sure, but really there isn't the need for it (in Boulder, Colorado, on the CU campus) anymore.   Believe me there are tons of other celebrations going on that day.  Don't need to camp out on the quad all day to get high."

Colorado,330fxw,Spoon_Pen,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:33:11 2015 UTC,"So what percentage of a film is necessary to have been filmed in Colorado for me to be allowed to mention it here? Oh, right - never stated and not a thing.   90% of this film was not shot in Illinois. Just some of the Marshall Field's store in the loop and Frank Shirley' office. If you are going to care about the percentage of location shot somewhere, then look up the IMDB entry - it's  mostly filmed in California on sound stages.   I think the argument can be made that since sound stages are not iconic in appearance, those location shots have a lot more to do with the look and feel of a film.  This is why location managers spend so much time trying to find just the right place.  The filmmakers essentially created somewhere that doesn't exist for this project.  You're not going on a day trip from the Rockies to a major iconic city like Chicago  (sorry, Denver - I love you, but it's not the same). I feel like both Breck and Chicago played equivalently large roles in the look and feel of this film, despite the majority being filmed in California.    Ironically enough, I learned about Breck as a location for this project from the guy who served as location manager for it. It meant quite a bit to him - he moved to Colorado afterwards."

Let's look at some of the films posted here in this thread that you did not start and the contents of which you do not dictate.    True Grit (original) - largely filmed in Colorado, some mexico and California.   The Prestige - Largely California, some Colorado.   Dumb & Dumber - Surprisingly, at least half of this movie appears to have been filmed in Utah, plus some in Nebraska and Pennsylvania in addition to Colorado.  Cannibal! the Musical - Actually, Utah isn't mentioned. This one appears to be all Colorado  (and, yes - it's hilarious).   Die Hard 2 - Largely California, some Colorado and Michigan.   Point being, though some films listed here are mostly filmed in Colorado, a lot of them aren't and most people don't give a shit. I don't give a shit.

Colorado,32x98h,PTWbrian,8,Fri Apr 17 14:00:47 2015 UTC,"Honest question, why farm in the desert? In the past when resources were abundant, sure, why not. But now as resources are pinched why not focus farming efforts where water isn't as scarce?"
Colorado,32x98h,sumpinaintright,4,Fri Apr 17 16:00:46 2015 UTC,"Also, why not make the canal a tunnel? Less evaporation and tumbleweed tumbles over it."
Colorado,32x98h,Amazingamazone,8,Fri Apr 17 16:02:45 2015 UTC,"Basically, money. These farmers aren't exactly swimming in cash (no pun intended). They're lucky to break even in average water years. Most of them have upgraded their on-farm infrastructure (gated pipe or sprinklers replacing dirt ditches) but the canal this farmer gets his water from is 50 miles long.  As far as ""why farm in the desert?"" I guess you could answer the question in a couple of ways. One, irrigation makes farming in Colorado viable and they own the water to do it. Second, farming is what keeps rural communities viable. If we ""shut down farming"" because water is tight there would be no people in this state outside of a couple of cities. I'd argue that's not the kind of state we want to be. Third, given scarcity of resources, are sprawling new subdivisions actually a better use than farming, especially given that the subdivisions are newer and presumably the homebuilders know they don't have a supply of water to live on? I wouldn't make that argument. These are just my opinions, of course, but at least the first two are embodied in the State Water Plan as well."
Colorado,32x98h,cavercody,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:10:23 2015 UTC,"Western farm land (and consequently, water) was divided up in an ignorant way by eastern politicians who didn't understand what the climate was like west of the 100th meridian. They kept with the notion of surveying and distributing land in quarters (160 ac) and later sections (640 ac). That worked fine in Minnesota, Iowa, etc. It was a terrible idea in the arid west.  There was also the wrong notion that the rain followed the plow. People honestly believed that plowing land changed the climate. It really just turned out to be an unseasonably wet decade. The US Government kept with an unsustainable settlement plan, eventually creating the Desert Lands Act.  So we are left with the aftermath of this. Some areas depopulated during the dust bowl. Would it be so bad if there were large, sparsely stretches of short-grass prairie in Colorado? It would be a lot like desert areas in Utah or Nevada. Instead we try to grow irrigated corn with yields half or a quarter what they would be in the Midwest where seeds grow fine with only the rain that falls on them."
Colorado,32x98h,raiderato,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:15:25 2015 UTC,"If it were economical, it would be done.  Either the cost of water (monetary, or scarcity) rises, or the cost of building tube/pipe lowers."

It doesn't even have to be fancy: just a grid of maybe branches or chicken wire to prevent the weeds from tumbling in. Maybe I'm thinking too practical.
Colorado,32x98h,blitzkreeger,6,Fri Apr 17 18:39:01 2015 UTC,"Farmers don't always think in man hours because there is often less of a ""wage"" to consider. Sometimes, the farmer is more likely to simply work harder and longer to solve the problem, and some farms have salaried personnel that simply add this to their workload. Often, the specific hardships that confront farmers are irregular, seasonal, and/or unexpected. That makes quantifying the cost in man hours somewhat difficult and makes them slow to invest in long-term solutions. Also, what non-farmers often don't realize is that the problem itself can reduce profits or productivity to the point that there is no extra income to invest in the solution without outside help."
Colorado,32x98h,raiderato,2,Fri Apr 17 19:20:06 2015 UTC,"That I understand but at some point it must outweigh the man hours spending untumbleweeding.   It obviously doesn't right now. If he has a single hour of rest in the day, it can be used to pull tumbleweeds. Until he regularly has too few hours in the day, there's no need to invest in a separate system."
Colorado,32x98h,ndrew452,2,Fri Apr 17 21:36:28 2015 UTC,"Well, Colorado isn't the desert (at least the part that people farm in), it is however semi-arid.  The main reason is because with water, it is a great growing area.  The growing season is short, but the amount of sunshine the area gets is a lot.  California grows food in the desert, but the climate there allows a 9 month growing season, all you need is water."

Sure, the federal government could come in an enforce it (which would require a huge number of DEA agents), but that would be their prerogative. The federal government could withhold funds to enforce it like they did with the drinking age being 21 by restricting highway funds, but that type of situation with marijuana legalization does not exist on the books.

In 1971, more than three decades before Lawrence v. Texas, Colorado legalized sodomy, also under Republican rule.

Under Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code, those violating the Controlled Substances Act—whether they’re common street dealers or vertically integrated, state-regulated marijuana businesses—are required to pay taxes on the proceeds of all their transactions, but without the benefit of deducting most normal business expenses. Unlike other illegal businesses—prostitution, gambling, or even murder for hire—only drug dealers are singled out for this special tax treatment. (Whereas a hit man who gets busted and forced to pay taxes on his blood money can deduct the cost of his sniper rifle, travel expense to and from the crime scene, etc.) The only break marijuana businesses get under 280E is that they can deduct their cost of obtaining their illegal goods.  The more a marijuana business can spend on growing its inventory (i.e., more marijuana), therefore, the more it can write off as the cost of goods, and the less it will have to pay in taxes. Anything Brandon had pocketed of the $1 million in revenue he made in 2013—or invested in, say, new retail space—would have been taxable. Instead, like many savvy marijuana entrepreneurs, he’s reinvesting his revenue in his grow operation   Source"

At my school, there were many great teachers, some of which I visit every time I come home from university. That being said, there were too many cases of teachers who had dug in and exploited the system, with inexcusable performance rates and hundreds of mad parents. I view this as a chance to root out the bad and revamp the way teachers are evaluated, rather than an excuse to protest and reject simply because of its difference."

SB 191, a state bill, mandated the teacher evaluation system. What has the Jeff Co board done to deepen or improve the implementation of SB 191 in order to improve the teacher pool? Implementing a pay for performance system isn't sufficient. It may help with retention of the effective teachers, but it does nothing for getting rid of the ineffective ones."

Colorado,32ceyi,raiderato,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:45:12 2015 UTC,"It's not as simple as cutting everyone an equal check.  There's an EITC type trigger than comes first and refunds money to low-income families (which becomes permanent once it starts), then if there's enough of a surplus the state income tax rate is lowered .15% to 4.5% (temporary), then if there's money left over it goes back to taxpayers proportionate to their tax burden.  That's if they don't use the money as tax credits to businesses, or for individuals for donations to local charities, etc.  We're looking at ~$25 after the tax credits are accounted for.  The marijuana refund will be a one-time thing. They messed up first-year estimates, but subsequent years will be OK (unless there's a crazy up-swing in revenue from it).    How much does it cost the state to send out such a minuscule amount of money?   Practically negligible when you tie it in with the non-marijuana refund."
Colorado,32ceyi,seeking_hope,4,Mon Apr 13 22:04:18 2015 UTC,I'd rather them give my $11 to schools. If I read the article it wasn't that tax is too high on weed (revenue was in the predicted range) but that revenue was high across the board.

Colorado,32ceyi,seeking_hope,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:47:05 2015 UTC,I know. I work for a non-profit.

Colorado,32ceyi,spelunkingbears,5,Tue Apr 14 01:21:57 2015 UTC,"I know that some of the tax did go to education, but not all of it. I think there was more money than expected and because of TABOR they have to give it back unless we vote to use it on education. In the past few years most municipalities around me have not voted for such taxes.    I would support more higher education tax credits. For the 2013 year (2014 report is pending), about 74% of Higher Education funding is paid by tuition[0]. It would be nice to use some of this money for Colorado scholarships.   Although I can't find the stat right now, K-12 funding per student is just as low. Which is surprising and unfortunate.   Before you down vote, Higher education source.

Colorado,329ezm,JoeRmusiceater,3,Sun Apr 12 05:10:45 2015 UTC,It helps to know some of the back story: Rtd couldn't afford to build the light rail it promised boulder so instead they are getting these new buses to service the Denver boulder route till they can build the light rail. Also Rtd is saying that these new buses are a premium product - equitable to light rail somehow. The chamber's argument is that it's 18 miles from Lincoln to union station on light rail (a  premium transit product) and its 24 miles from union station to table Mesa pnr. So why are Boulder Denver routes priced $2.50 more than an relatively equal length route on a premium product in Denver. Really I think the whole thing comes down to Boulder is still pissed they are not getting a light rail yet and a protesting fare increases to punish RTD.

So if you do have a red card and you answer no, well you just fucked yourself by lying to Feds, Best advice Buy the guns first then go get your red card bro not worth getting into legal troubles over a loophole that's there just for this"

NO having a red card, more weed than the 1oz limit, cheaper taxes, no wait, membership benefits for signing up & and for how much you spend. The benefits of having a red card outweigh the Rec user, downside is you can't get a conceal weapons permit or buy guns, doesn't mean a family member can't buy it for you"

So I can't really give a definitive answer on that yet, but I am curious.   I know technically it's in the gray federally, but I don't think the ATF will go down the slippery road of confiscating guns from legal medical marijuana patients just for using marijuana. I don't break any laws other than the federal marijuana law, and maybe the occasional 10 mph over the speed limit or California stop, so I think there are bigger fish to fry and people like me deserve to have their gun rights in tact."

Whether or not you own a medical card has no bearing on things, per the state constitution that registry can't be used for anything but verifying medical card status.    The DEA has indicated they would respect states in this manner and so far has not tried to access information from any state where marijuana use is constitutionally protected.  Ultimately it can be a tricky violation of breaking more than one law at a time, a rule that's often been in play with marijuana use.

There at this time is no credible risk of prosecution from being a user of marijuana and owning a fire arm. Taking away a gun owners rights over marijuana alone in Colorado is politically difficult and something the ATF is not doing, or considering to do. The only reasonable situation where this is possible, is where the fire arm was used in a felony, and drug charges where added on.   The only advice to op should be, always use your weapon responsibly. Secure the fire arm when not in use, and never operate it when they're under the influence of any substance.  If they are purchasing a weapon for self defense, take a NRA approved course, and consider purchasing legal insurance."

Colorado,326ns0,tecrogue,9,Sun Apr 12 00:40:45 2015 UTC,"ATF Form 4473 question 11e: ""Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?""  All of the debate and uncertainty is centered around the word ""unlawful"". It's obviously legal under state law, but federal law trumps that and declares it illegal, so technically any pot use is unlawful (even ""medical""). It's also a federal form and process. The CBI is not giving you ""permission"" to get a firearm; they're just telling the dealer that you don't have disqualifying criminal history. Their involvement doesn't make this a state thing.  If you tell the truth and say ""Yes"" to question 11e, then you are not a legal firearm purchaser and the dealer cannot sell to you. If you lie and say ""No"", then you've committed a federal felony. I'd be surprised to see them come after anyone in a pot-legal state, but it is within their power. If you had a medical card at the time you filled the ATF form out, then there's a paper trail that shows you lied, so that's a lot more actionable than most other cases. However, they aren't going to automatically know that you have a medical card, so something would have to happen for them to find that evidence.  Whatever you decide to do, please at least be responsible enough to keep the firearms away and locked up whenever the pot is nearby (or if you are under even the slightest influence of it), just as us non-smokers do for alcohol. That will get you in trouble with even state law, not to mention that it's just common sense."

What's more, you likely established probable cause for his search and seizure (for not letting you leave) by being observed smoking in public in a place where possession is illegal. Even with a lawyer, it doesn't sound like you have much to argue. It's not an excuse to say, ""most people get away doing the same illegal thing here.""  Also, even though a grassroots movement to encourage a state to take possession of federal land will most certainly fail, surely you realize that Colorado will not keep the area as a park. This is not a states' rights battle; you should focus your effort on federal legalization."
Colorado,3285jt,herbalblend,-9,Sat Apr 11 14:29:44 2015 UTC,"What makes think colorado wouldn't manage the lands better? Federal legalization will happen but it'll be a while. Until then we'll focus locally on getting the local laws of the land respected.   I'm no lawyer, but I highly doubt observing someone through binoculars smoking ""something"" is probable cause. If that was true anyone observed smoking a cigg could be searched and detained"
Colorado,3285jt,herbalblend,6,Sat Apr 11 14:43:00 2015 UTC,"What makes think colorado wouldn't manage the lands better?   First, Colorado republicans have said for years that land recapture would immediately result in sale or mineral rights leases to private companies (e.g., mining, oil & gas, timber, etc.).  Second, park maintenance is expensive (e.g., clearing, inspections, trailhead maintenance, ranger staffing, etc.). So even if CO recaptured some lands either taxes would rise or current benefits would be cut.       Until then we'll focus locally on getting the local laws of the land respected.   I'm not sure what part of this you aren't understanding. These lands are not Colorado lands. Jurisdiction is based on physical dividing lines called borders. Colorado law will apply to Colorado land, but not to Federal land that is just a foot away. Your argument is akin to saying that New Mexico law should apply in Trinidad and Durango just because they're nearby the New Mexico border.       I'm no lawyer, but I highly doubt observing someone through binoculars smoking ""something"" is probable cause.   Well, the good news is that I am and I can assure you that whether you're the federal backwoods or in LoDo, if you're in public and you can be viewed by an officer who is legally permitted to be where he is (i.e., he is not trespassing, etc.), anything that officer sees can serve as a basis for probable cause. Using enhancement technology like binoculars is fine too. The general rule in most jurisdictions is that if the technology is available to or accessible to the public, the police can use it too. For example, would you complain if another hiker saw you with his binoculars and reported to the park ranger? Well, you might, but you'd be wrong. If you're curious, one example SCOTUS case is Lee v. United States.  Also, the probable cause here is not just based on observing smoke. The probable cause is a combination of all factors he can observe: pipe lighting techniques, your behavior, bumper stickers, etc.   Despite that, remember that it is often illegal to smoke anything at all because of fire restrictions in BLM areas. So even in this case, smoke itself might easily serve as probable cause.   Despite that, remember that it is often illegal (and highly dangerous to hikers and other trees in the area) to shoot firearms of any sort BLM areas without a license, especially on popular trails.      TL;DR (1) even if you save for a lawyer, you're not going to win, (2) even if you succeed in your grassroots movement to recapture BLM lands for CO, you won't get the backwoods pot haven that you are anticipating, and (3) you need to be more careful with your weapons, your drugs, and your confidence in the law.      Edited for minor spelling corrections & clarifications."

I said that often there are and that you would be well-advised to be more cautious when you're traveling through federal territory.  I did not, and haven't, written that there are licenses required for target shooting. I did say that you are incorrect in your perception that you can use your rifle for whatever you want wherever you want.

Colorado,3211rl,jinnetics,17,Thu Apr 9 18:47:10 2015 UTC,"Very interesting.  HOWEVER, The Sand Dunes one is misleading.    Medano Creek floods every year in late spring and/or early summer. Its caused by snow melt in the Sangre DeCristos to the east.  On big snow years (like last year for example), the creek floods and would produce a similar picture to the 1987 picture for perhaps a couple of months.  Later in the season (Late July on), the creek dries up and would appear more like the 2011 image.   They did not put what month each of those images was taken which in the case of Medano creek, is the difference between flowing and totally absent on the surface.  Furthermore, they imply that Medano creek feeds the aquifers that would supply the the pivot irragation visable to the west.  This is absolutely incorrect.  Those aquifer's are supplied from entierly different sources than Medano creek. In fact, most of the aquifers in the San Luis Valley originate on the West side of the valley, miles away from this image (On the Eastern Extent).  The water that flows through Medano Creek is much more shallow and eventually contributes to the Marshlands that partially make up the reserve West of the park.  I'm all for showing people climate change effects, but they should not have chosen the Sand Dunes as an example.    The best example was the Arapahoe Glacier retreat.  (I did some Geological Mapping of the San Luis Valley and surrounding mountains in the 90's)."
Colorado,3211rl,JingJang,4,Thu Apr 9 20:48:20 2015 UTC,Very well said.  I'd imagine that May vs September in the same year would yield drastically different images as well.
Colorado,3211rl,tmtreat,3,Fri Apr 10 02:10:20 2015 UTC,Good comment. But the images are both from the same time of year -- October. (I built this page for work and have added that very key piece of information.) Here's the sauce.
Colorado,3211rl,nbminor,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:32:13 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  Was 1987 an unusually wet monsoon or was there an unusual weather event that caused this much water to be at the surface at this time of year?  My understanding is that amount of water, at that time of year, would be extremely unusual at any time since we've been keeping records.  Does NASA have any imagery for October in other years in the mid 1980's for the same area?     Regardless, the area shown (which after review is actually east of the National park and includes San Luis Lake State Park), seems like a very poor example of climate change since the water level (and even that localized water table), vary by several feet over the course of a typical year.  A week long typical monsoon pattern could produce a similar variation.   The website you linked to does not explain any of this.  The label of the slide is ""Stream Change, Colorado""  They clearly imply the change in the image is due to climate change.  They also imply that the water recharges the aquifers that feed the center pivot irrigation, which as I pointed out is not accurate.  The overall point of the imagery is still very striking and it is important for people to see the effect a changing climate have on our planet.  I just make the point I do because there are many organizations and people (I work in oil and gas so I'm aware of this first hand), that try to muddy the valid observations of change that we DO have.  Its best not to give people trying to muddy good science any more material to work with. There are plenty of better observations that can't be picked apart and or dismissed.  Thank You for your link. I spent quite a while looking at the other images."

Colorado,3227ug,fultron,5,Thu Apr 9 23:59:48 2015 UTC,"These credits/incentives don't generate any jobs and don't benefit anyone but the multi-million dollar film industry.   In Maryland, where the Netflix series ""House of Cards"" is shot, a recent report by the legislature's nonpartisan staff found that for every dollar in film incentives the state doles out, it gets back only 10 cents in state and local tax revenue.  In Louisiana, known as ""Hollywood South"" for the size of its entertainment industry, a new study commissioned by the state's economic development department says taxpayers lost as much as $184 million on film tax credits last year.  In the fall, Nevada shifted most of the money from its film incentives program into a package of tax breaks for electric carmaker Tesla. And Michigan and North Carolina have substantially scaled back their credits.  ""They're a colossal waste of money,"" said Paul Stam, the Republican speaker pro tempore in North Carolina's House of Representatives. ""We were sending big checks to Hollywood producers and rich guys out of state."" […]  In Michigan, Republican Governor Rick Snyder has labeled film incentives and other targeted tax credits the ""heroin drip"" of government.   http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/30/filmcredit/J1kTrxz48Ax70D22RziOVO/story.html?rss_id=Top-GNP   According to the BLS, there were 1,537 “motion picture and video production jobs” in 2001 and 1,561 of those jobs in 2013, the latest year data is available. The state has spent $494.4 million on the film credit program from 2008 through 2014.   http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/21016   Massachusetts did a study that found the overwhelming number of jobs generated by location shoots went to out-of-state workers.  College of Charleston economic analyst Frank Hefner found that of each tax credit dollar offered by South Carolina, just 19 cents came back to the state.  The Louisiana Legislature’s chief economist, Greg Albrecht, reported that incentives were likely costing the state millions more than it was generating. “Does [the state] receive more tax receipts back, either directly or indirectly, than what we’re paying out?” he wrote. “The answer is definitely no.”  Meanwhile, critics of incentives were increasing. Economist Bob Tannenwald of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said “the revenue forgone via film tax credits has to be made up elsewhere, either in tax increases or spending cuts. Both depress the economy and cut off the incentive’s stimulus effect.”  In California, there was evidence that the number of film jobs created after tax incentives were enacted declined. TV and film production jobs went from almost 123,000 in 2004 to 107,400 in 2012. The state’s legislative fiscal analyst reported twice—in 2010 and 2014—that incentives were of dubious value to the state. (It didn’t help that they may have fostered corruption. Sen. Ron Calderon, a Democrat from California’s 30th senate district, is under indictment for allegedly accepting money to try to expand the state’s movie incentive program to independent producers.)”   http://www.newsreview.com/reno/ready-for-my-tax-breaks/content?oid=13620710"

That said, this bill should have passed because children cannot protect themselves from their parents without the intervention of government. What the Republicans failed to realize about their ""choice"" argument is that by striking down this bill they aren't preserving the right to choose a method of therapy. They are enabling parents to forcibly subject children to potentially damaging activities against their will. The child has no choice.  In order to preserve the freedom of choice, and simultaneously protect children from potentially damaging activity imposed on them by their parents (whom they cannot protect themselves against), this bill should have been upheld.

The NW corridor is one of the fastest growing areas in the state. I would ride it up to Longmont to work and my fiance would ride it into Denver for work.

Colorado,31q6n0,dancingmanatee,4,Thu Apr 9 19:49:27 2015 UTC,"Oh don't worry, the local governments here are already fucking furious. Broomfield, Westminster, Superior, Louisville, Boulder, and Longmont all told RTD that they need to make good on their promises, or they were going to withhold the money that they've been collecting to pay RTD. I believe it was a representative from Longmont or Boulder who was cited in several articles saying ""I can't sell my constituents on a rail system that won't be delivered for 60 years!"". RTD had some 'emergency consultation' meetings with the leaders of said municipalities and tried to sell the bus rapid transit (BRT) system as a replacement.  The RTD site says they're going to go through with the light rail plan... but they've removed the estimated completion dates from the NW corridor part past Westminster. The only reason Westminster has a completion date is because it correlates with them redoing the old mall at 88th and Sheridan as part of their new downtown.  From Westminster's own site:   The timing for the rail line is unknown since RTD does not currently have the funds for additional rail construction for the Northwest Rail Line north of the Westminster Station at 69th Avenue and Hooker Street. Therefore, the timing for development is also unknown.    There ya have it. I'm with ya on the buses... I don't think it's a viable solution, even if they have their own lane. People jump the line and drive in the carpool lane right now when traffic is backed up. Somehow because it's a bus, RTD thinks it won't be effected."

And the fact there was going to be two light rail stations within 10 minutes was a huge bonus. Even if we had to wait a few years for it.  The fact that light rail has been indefinitely put on hold AND they sold off 36 expansion to toll companies is complete and utter bullshit.

Chances are you will get to vote on whether to accept the refund on marijuana tax revenue. If If voters decide to let the state government keep it, it will go to EXACTLY what Amendment 64 and Prop AA said when voters approved them: to school construction and regulation of the marijuana industry. If voters want the refunds, it will likely be divided in thirds: two thirds will go back to the industry through sales and excise tax refunds; the taxpayers would get the last third: a few dollars, at best. The total refund is about $58 million.  The second TABOR refund, about $70 million, is the one that would go to other uses, should the voters approve it. However, it's very unlikely that it will go to the ballot and it will just get refunded, again, less than $10 per taxpayer, and will come through the filing of your 2015 tax returns in a year."

Colorado,31l9bz,autowikibot,2,Mon Apr 6 14:05:50 2015 UTC,"Evaporative cooler:       An evaporative cooler (also swamp cooler, desert cooler and wet air cooler) is a device that cools air through the evaporation of water. Evaporative cooling differs from typical air conditioning systems which use vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycles. Evaporative cooling works by employing water's large enthalpy of vaporization. The temperature of dry air can be dropped significantly through the phase transition of liquid water to water vapor (evaporation), which can cool air using much less energy than refrigeration. In extremely dry climates, evaporative cooling of air has the added benefit of conditioning the air with more moisture for the comfort of building occupants.

Big difference is that Cool. is multi-staged so that it moves horizontally across the dew point chart ( ex. swamp cooler on a given day might be able to get down to 65, Cool's setup cools half of the intake air to 65, than half of that is cooled down further ).  End result is colder air with I believe less humidity.  Unfortunately that fractional evaporative cooler is this weird zig/zag exchange thing which last I knew is done by hand.  That said, it claims to be almost as good as a freon system at expense of water use."

Colorado,31gvbz,SaltyPancakes,31,Sun Apr 5 14:52:53 2015 UTC,"The craziest thing that ever happened to me was up by Rollins Pass, Moffat Tunnel/Rollinsville/Nederland area. It was back a few years ago when we had that massive snow year and my family was going on a backcountry skiing trip up the crater lakes trail where there was still a shit ton of snow. Well there are two lakes up there, two at treeline and one above in this big cliff bordered cirque. My family hiked just a little above the trees but didn't go much farther cause we were tired/avi risk/storms moving in. Well my mom and sister get ready to ski down and this massive boom of thunder echoes from the lake farther up and we think we hear someone scream. It was fucking creepy as hell. My mom and sister ski down while we decide to go farther up and see if anyone needs help. We make it to the top of the incline that leads to the third lake and can see into most of the cirque and we call out to anyone down there. No one heard anything and the storm was moving in so we decided to make our way down figuring it was nothing. Right as we go though we hear the sound of a prop plane, the little private ones, like it is flying just inside the clouds. I'm not a pilot but those storms look scary as hell from the ground and I can't imagine flying in them. We look for the plane but we never see it and the sound eventually fades. We make it down fine and I almost forgot about the whole incident until the next time I went back there with my friend three years later. There was no snow at the time and we hiked all the way up to the third lake and it was gorgeous. We have lunch at the lake and then we make it farther up the cirque where it starts to get steeper. I start to just feel kind of uneasy so I sit down while he finishes going up to something that ""caught his eye"" He makes it nearly all the way up and comes back and says that he found something. He shows me pictures on his phone and there is a sheared off airplane wing from one of those little commuter prop planes sitting in the wildflowers. I don't really believe in ghosts, but that was fucking creepy."

Then we heard something moving at the perimeter of the fire light. Then came the eyes. Slowly, a black steer wandered into the light. Then he screamed that scream. My friend grabbed a stick and hauled ass after that steer shouting ""you motherfucker you scared the shit out of me you fucking dumb cow fucking get the hell out of here!""

I woke up around daylight but the two other staff were still sleeping. I heard loud cracks and rocks falling. I knew it was branches breaking and sounded like a large animal. I got up to look and saw black fur moving about 50 feet away from our campsite. I thought it was a bear so I woke my coworker. We stayed very still as the creature moved toward us. Then we saw splotches of white fur. It was not a bear. It was a cow that had wandered off from a rancher's land.

If you are a guy who thinks homosexuality is a sin, don't have sex with other dudes. It's a pretty simple concept. If we collectively decide to ignore the legal framework separating church and state, it's only a matter of time until that choice is used to oppress a specific religious institution instead of supporting it.

Edit: I'll just assume True Christians™ are downvoting me instead of actually reading leviticus, which I have. I was raised by batshit crazy baptists in North East TN in a church that had ties to the snake churches. That's 100% why there's an issue with homosexuality in their eyes.

The problem comes when that belief leads them to view homosexuals as less worthy of civil rights than they are. If they don't want to let gay people get married in their churches they shouldn't be forced to let it happen. However, that has no bearing on the legal implications of a marriage and who the government will recognize as a legitimate married couple.

Also there is a 4 year close in age exception in the state for people under fifteen and 10 years for 15 and 16 year olds.

The law does make an exception for juveniles who are under the age of 17 and wish to engage in sexual activities with another juvenile. This provision is called the “Romeo and Juliet Law” and it provides for minors who are both under the legal age of consent but close to the same age. They may engage in sexual activities without worrying about legal prosecution in Colorado cities like Englewood, Aurora, Lakewood, or Castle Rock. Colorado gives a child of 15 or 16 the legal right to consent to sexual relations with someone else not more than ten years older than them and children younger than 15 may also have give legal sexual consent to a person who is not more than four years older than them. If the older person in the relationship is in a position of trust with the younger, the age restrictions are different."

And frankly as shitty as my life is living in a car and yes this is homeless, it's a better use of my time than working in a mind numbing min wage job. It is a choice. Not in that this is what I want, but that it's the lesser of two evils. I want a job that respects me and my intelligence. I want a tiny one room cabin and a garage, and I want to be able to support that on 25 or less hours a week , so I can spend time learning, loving , inventing and helping.   At the end of the day though it is a choice for me to be homeless, only in the sense that the alternative is soul crushing depression and a studio apartment.   I have a job and place to live for the summer but until then and after then I will almost certainly remain homeless and unable to build a life or future."

I don't start until Monday, then I won't get a paycheck for another 2 weeks (approx.)

Colorado,30q4gv,karmakoopa,5,Sun Apr 5 18:49:52 2015 UTC,I completely forgot about that somehow. For that I'd definitely be looking a pre-owned for price. Seems like it has a great lifespan too based on what seems like a great resale value.
Colorado,30q4gv,usernamesarethebane,2,Sun Mar 29 19:35:41 2015 UTC,"4runner owner here. I love my Toyota. It's an 01 with 218k and drives like new. the back has a ton of space and the back seats are totally useful. I avoided the xterra because the backseat and it has rear leaf springs, which I thought made the ride less nice than the 4runner. Tacomas are basically the same thing as a 4runner btw. Can't go wrong with either"

It has been great in the mountains, gone everywhere I've needed it to, and has done all of the above while keeping me and my wife super comfortable.  Seriously consider the 4runner.  You will pay for it, though.  They are like gold here in Colorado, and even heavily used ones go for $7k+.  I intend to keep mine until it dies."

Aftermarket support is fantastic as well.   Gas mileage is better on the newer versions, about 18-20. I run 31"" offroad tires, a bull bar, and rock sliders and get about 15-16, mostly city. Granted I keep up with maintenance religiously.   The only thing that's better offroad from the factory is the Wrangler, but unless you get a super expensive version, they only seat 4 with barely any trunk space."

And if it's your cup of tea, comes in auto or with a 6spd manual, like the xterra. It'll also hold its value a lot better,which is why I chose it over a wrangler or an xterra."

Colorado,30q4gv,MeltBanana,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:06:35 2015 UTC,"No mention of the Chevy Trailblazer?  I think it's built on the same frame as the Colorado.  Of course it was discontinued, but if you intend to use a vehicle for any serious hauling or off-roading, then you don't want something new anyway...  I have a 2004 Trailblazer, picked it up in 2009.  Had a bum transmission when I got it, which the dealership replaced, and haven't had any issues since.  The only problem I have now is my radio died and I'm too lazy to replace it...  I've done a lot of mods including CAI, custom tune, full steel front bumper and skid, oversize tires and a slight lift, and swapping the original gears for some 4.10's.  I've hauled a 5000-pound trebuchet trailer up to Estes, and I've taken it on all-day cross-country drives.  The thing is really comfortable, and there's plenty of room to move around during those long trips.  Gas mileage isn't the best, but I didn't buy it for that.  Rear space is good - I can slide in 4' wide sheets of plywood or throw down a tarp for a load of rock.  This is the first 4WD I've done maintenance on, but the front comes apart pretty easy once you figure it out.  The only special tool I've had to buy was a 35mm socket for the front axle nut.  It is larger than a Blazer, but smaller than a Tahoe... it could be tight on really narrow trails, but it has plenty of power to crawl around in 4LO.  It also plows right through snow.  The original 3.42 gears were only useful for constant highway driving, so try to get 3.73's or 4.10's if you can.  Both an I6 and V8 engine were available -- I have the I6 and been happy with it.  Think that about covers it?"

Colorado,30q4gv,bikenbass,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:35:58 2015 UTC,"I'd say a v6 4x4 tacoma or xterra would treat you well. It depends on if you want a bed or a covered cargo space. They both have their pros and cons(ie you can throw a couch in your truck, but for half the year is going to be filled with snow and all your shit will end up wet/frozen).   I bought a new Tacoma in 2005 and it's treated me well for the past few years. The U-joints needed replacing about a year ago, but that's the only thing that's gone wrong on it. I'm looking to get a new vehicle when I can afford it though, because I bought my truck when I was living in Florida and a rwd 4cyl seemed just fine. I drive from Denver to glenwood a lot and like heading into the mountains to camp...rwd with a weak engine sucks for that. It's also a nightmare in the snow, even with snow tires and several hundreds pounds of sand in the bed. I'm leaning toward an Xterra for my new vehicle because it's got the power, true 4wd, had awesome cargo space, and comes in manual. It's also damn sexy with a lift and some good tires.   If you do decide to get an Xterra do not get an automatic transmission from 2005-2009(I think those are the years). They suffer from the ""strawberry milkshake of death"". Aside from that they seem to be pretty solid."

Do I have to spin my tires to prove I have AWD? I think this will be costly if not dangerous to try and enforce, as it will back up traffic even more to stop people on I-70 and check if their tires are up to par."
Colorado,30ipxt,Slider388,1 point,Thu Apr 2 05:45:23 2015 UTC,I'm all for this. I live west of vail pass and the amount of eisenhower/vail pass accidents and closures in the winter is ridiculous.  I've been stuck having to stay in silverthorne away from home when the pass closes. I70 is a huge lifeline and all it takes is a couple unskilled people with bald tires to close it down.
Colorado,30ipxt,neatopat,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:25:04 2015 UTC,"This is really stupid. Is someone driving through the state supposed to buy and fit their car with snow tires for the chance that they might encounter a snow storm on a small stretch of highway? Also, just about any car with all-season tires is going to do better than a corvette with snow tires."
Colorado,30ipxt,ndrew452,3,Sat Mar 28 01:17:45 2015 UTC,"I assume that the law will only be enforced when it is actually snowing.  While commercial vehicles have to have chains on their truck, they don't have to put them on unless it's snowing.  I imagine that troopers will only enforce such a measure when it is poor driving conditions.  Chances are, is that this law will also be used to fine the drivers if they get stuck or in an accident.  I don't know if the CSP has the manpower to stop every car going up 70, but they do have the manpower to ticket some idiot from Texas who thinks his bald tires will make it up a snowy mountain.   In California, they have similar laws, but from what I have heard they actually stop people from continuing unless they buy chains right there on the roadside. I do agree with this law as California is notorious for having a lot of California drivers."
Colorado,30ipxt,jsmmr5,2,Sat Mar 28 19:26:30 2015 UTC,"If I am understanding this correctly, the requirement will be for vehicles to have ""snow-rated"" tires but that doesn't mean they can't be all-season. The all-season tires will have to have the ""snowflake/mountain"" emblem designated that they match the correct rating for usefulness in snow like the one's I happen to have for reference.    Wrangler DuraTrac light truck tires (with the exception of the 255/55R19-size) are branded with the mountain/snowflake symbol to identify they meet the industry's severe snow service standards.   Also, this really only applies if you cause/are in an accident, otherwise I doubt this is really enforceable."

Colorado,30f6as,satanisativa,17,Thu Mar 26 21:38:40 2015 UTC,"100% hypothetical.   Would I be able to change my gender on my birth certificate from Male to Female if the draft were to be reinstated, and no longer have to be part of the draft with this new bill?"
Colorado,30f6as,bandito5280,6,Fri Mar 27 00:08:16 2015 UTC,"That's a super interesting question!  I found this site which approaches things the other way around, for ftm transexuals.  It advises anyone identifying as male to register for the draft, with the caveat that their transexual status will likely disqualify them as much as flat-footedness or obesity.  It also mentions there's no official Federal policy for transexuals and the draft, and that historically they go off markers like driver's license and passport.    So, if you can update your birth certificate and then update your state-issued driver's license, it might be effective.  Your social security records can be updated in the same way, thanks /u/tgjer!   If your government-assigned gender markers are mixed and you find yourself in a situation where this causes trouble with Selective Service issues (or other disputes over identity), you may wish to obtain a ""carry letter"" to help alleviate such difficulties. A carry letter is an informal name for a document, usually signed by a medical professional, that declares and explains your transsexual status. While not a perfect solution, a carry letter can be produced to explain why there may be more than one official gender marker associated with your records.   And if you're faking things, you might have to shop around to find a doctor that would sign off."
Colorado,30f6as,DeviatedNorm,5,Fri Mar 27 00:17:13 2015 UTC,That's super interesting.   So the letter would be a thing that is needed for things like jobs I assume. Considering they need your SSN and you mark the box for male or female for certain papers ion being hired.
Colorado,30f6as,bandito5280,3,Fri Mar 27 00:51:28 2015 UTC,"It's actually fairly easy to change the gender on social security cards.  They changed their policy a few years ago, they no longer require proof of reconstructive surgery, just a letter from a medical provider stating that the person is undergoing treatment for gender dysphoria. ""Carry letters"" are something most people use only early in transition, if at all.  Most trans people get this letter when starting hormone supplements. Same goes for passports - a letter from a GP certifying the patient is trans is enough. But if you're not actually trans and not getting any treatment, you'll probably have a hard time getting the letter."
Colorado,30f6as,tgjer,3,Fri Mar 27 17:11:03 2015 UTC,Right. This bill would align Colorado law on birth certificates with federal policies as well as the Colorado process for changing the gender on a driver's license.
Colorado,30f6as,pinklaura,3,Fri Mar 27 20:07:34 2015 UTC,"Anyone who has an ID that identifies them as male between the ages of 18 and 26 is legally required to register.  Trans people with male ID at those ages still have to register, but are currently barred from military service. So if there was a new draft pretending to be trans might become the new ""pretending to be gay to stay out of Vietnam"". But that wasn't very effective in Vietnam, and if we actually had a draft I doubt it would be very effective now.   ""ID that identifies you as male"" is also complicated. For one, there's no single ""legal gender"" in the US. There's just every piece of legal ID you have, all issued by different agencies, that all have different rules for if/when/how you can change the gender on it.   It's never just a matter of filling out a form saying you want the gender changed. Even the easiest to change ID, like federal passports and social security cards, require a letter from a medical provider certifying that you are undergoing treatment for gender dysphoria. That normally means hormone supplements.  So unless you want to start taking huge doses of estrogen that will effectively send you through female puberty, and anti-androgens to block your body's production of testosterone, it'll be hard to get a doctor to write the letter to change your ID."
Colorado,30f6as,tgjer,0,Fri Mar 27 17:16:16 2015 UTC,"Under this proposed law, you have to get a statement from a licensed health care provider affirming you are going through ""appropriate clinical treatment"" so a person would not just be able to change the gender on their birth certificate for any reason."

Colorado,30f6as,TheMrNick,0,Wed Apr 1 15:10:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's my point. Changing the birth certificate gender would be more consistent than having two names. Since you're arguing that a BC is of the utmost importance for ""record keeping"", it would make more sense to have the BC reflect the current state of that individual rather than be different, right? When you have two names, your legally changed name and your birth name, wouldn't that be a ""worse"" record than a consistent gender assignment? Why can a name, arguably a more important social distinction than gender, be different but having a consistent gender assignment would be anarchy?  And of course this assuming that a BC is somehow as important as you're making it out to be, which I doubt it is. When's the last time you had to break out your BC to prove your identity? When a cop pulls you over, do they ask for your BC?"
Colorado,30f6as,pinklaura,2,Wed Apr 1 16:20:08 2015 UTC,It's a historical record of the birth. That's it. It should reflect the birth.

Edit: Based on the downvoting and your response, I hope you aren't assuming I'm against supporting the transgender community in every way possible. I simply stated I can't think of too many instances where your official gender on your birth certificate would be required."
Colorado,30f6as,EchoLyn,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:12:22 2015 UTC,"Because I do not have a passport, I have to present a driver's license and birth certificate (because those are the only two forms of ID I have) on my new hire paperwork. Transgender people are often also living in poverty, so may only have a birth certificate as identification. None of those places NEED to know your gender, but they do need some form of ID to let you do those things and a birth certificate is one of those forms and your gender is on it.  It's also important to note that currently, even if you go through the whole process to change the gender on your Colorado birth certificate, it notes your birth certificate is amended, so anyone you present that document to can ask why it is amended, which also does not protect privacy. This bill issues a new birth certificate instead of one marked amended."
Colorado,30f6as,Literally_JaclynGlen,2,Fri Mar 27 20:44:53 2015 UTC,"Ah, so it's a privacy issue. I wish you would have specified that from the start- my original comment was,   I can't imagine too many instances where someone would need to check the gender on their birth certificate.   Emphasis on ""check the gender"". I wasn't implying you didn't need these documents for certain circumstances, but rather that whatever your gender is on those documents, it wouldn't matter to what you're using them for. It doesn't, but it could put you in an awkward position if someone questioned why your gender said ""x"" but you looked ""y"".   How does that violate your privacy? I'd also recommend using your social security card as a second form of ID, it's much easier to carry around :)"

Legal growers even warned the participants that they would get caught and that their grow houses were illegal.

Not only that but they lead a fairly large scale operation too. We need to eliminate the black market. Legalization with strict regulation is the only realistic way you will keep your legal weed.
Colorado,30esqa,nealio1000,11,Thu Mar 26 22:24:43 2015 UTC,Wanna eliminate the black market?  Legalize it on the federal level instead of locking up non violent offenders
Colorado,30esqa,v00dude,2,Thu Mar 26 22:32:29 2015 UTC,I believe we are getting closer to this point every year. More and more states are decriminalizing small amounts and creating medical programs. I think once there's wider support for it throughout the country it will change on the federal level. So far the feds haven't been cruel to us. They have cracked down on only the people violating our state laws. They could be a royal pain in the ass and conduct random raids of marijuana businesses who are abiding by state law but they haven't been. This process has been slow but the last 5 years have been extremely kind. I'd be optimistic. You just have to be realistic. Removing all prohibition and regulation is not realistic at all.
Colorado,30esqa,nealio1000,4,Thu Mar 26 22:40:09 2015 UTC,Good luck changing federal prohibition. There is no way any politician with half a brain would go for complete legalization with no regulation.
Colorado,30esqa,nealio1000,4,Thu Mar 26 22:52:56 2015 UTC,I haven't been saying that it should be prohibited. Just regulated. I'm arguing with the people who think there should be no restrictions and everything should just be legal. What I'm trying to explain is that that is unrealistic and would do nothing to benefit our state. In fact even more people would flood here for the wild weed west. I benefit a lot from this situation. Weed is legal and I don't have to worry about the police wasting their time with the little guys and the taxes from it go to help my state. I'm totally ok paying the tax on it if it means we can be the model for the rest of the country to follow.
Colorado,30esqa,nealio1000,4,Fri Mar 27 00:24:15 2015 UTC,Well there isn't much harm... that's why you are legally allowed to do those things as long as you are over a certain age and you aren't a dick about it in public.
Colorado,30esqa,nealio1000,3,Fri Mar 27 01:29:00 2015 UTC,"There is research that shows THC slows development in adolescent brains. Regulation keeps it out of young hands. Also, you can't sell your home brewed beer though with out a license. In order to brew beer, by federal law you cannot brew more than 100 gallons in a year if you are in a household with only 1 adult. 200 gallons if you have more than one adult over 18 in your household. At 100 gallons you are producing about 34 ounces a day.  State law says you can grow up to 6 plants per adult, of which 3 may be flowering at any given time.  These rules are not here to keep you from doing it. The regulations keep third parties safe and honest people honest. Sure nobody will know if I brew 101 gallons or grow 7 plants, or even 500 gallons, but what would I do with it besides give it away and sell it? Who will buy beer from me if I don't have some authority saying ""Hey, this guy is safe, he isn't a criminal and there isn't sketchy stuff in his beer"" plus there is no way I could drink 500 gallons of beer in a year unless I stopped drinking water and caring about my health in general."
Colorado,30esqa,codfos,3,Fri Mar 27 01:37:28 2015 UTC,"You realize I am arguing FOR legalization right by discussing regulation? Regulation does not mean prohibition.   I believe that that's naive at best. Quazi-attentive parents keep it out of kids hands, just like they do alcohol and tobacco. With prohibition it's sometimes easier for kids to get weed than it is alcohol or tobacco.   What is naive? Saying that it isn't acceptable to allow a 10 year old to go to a store and buy pot and smoke the shit out of it? I'm not saying we need to prohibit weed. I'm saying a complete lack of regulation would be harmful to those incapable of making proper and responsible decisions for themselves such as children.   Wasn't talking about selling, and the limits seem largely arbitrary, at 100 gallons everything is fine and dandy, but if you go to 101 gallons watch out? What harm am I inflicting on anyone that justifies harm being inflicted on me if I just brew beer for shits and giggles and share it all with my family and friends?   Like I said further down, nobody is going to stop me from brewing a little extra, or even a lot extra. Sure 100 gallons seems arbitrary when you're trying to consider a single value a certain range between say 80-120 gallons. You aren't harming anyone and nobody will likely stop, you up to a point. Maybe you have so much you can't drink it and you can't share it (which is completely allowed) but you don't want to waste it because of the time and money you already spent? Would you pour it down the drain?   Again, arbitrary, what leap in harm is there going from 6-7? I want to know if people really feel there's some massive justification for breaking into someone's house with machine guns because they have a plant.   Again, regulated to a point of personal use. How much does an average person consume? I bet that many. Some more, some less but I bet the average right about there.   That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence.   I don't how how quoting Hitchen's razor here to counter my point about honesty fits because I am not trying prove more than honest people shouldn't be afraid if they're following a law they voted for and their representatives built.    The threat of possibly getting killed in a 3am no-knock raid keeps you from doing it, or being assaulted/threatened in any other way. What justifies that threat? I want to grow an acre of the stuff because I'm worried about global warming, what's it matter?   That threat is justified by your illegal activity and the proof behind it. Up until recently, large scale producers had to have protection from outside threats from other producers as well as police and other agencies. They did that with their own machine guns. You can not expect to enter that situation unarmed with the intention of shutting down an illegal activity that large without equal or better firepower. It isn't like police are going door to door and raiding homes for weed. If they did, that would be an even larger waste of manpower and money than they already waste. They raid where they have sufficient evidence to apprehend the individual(s).  If you grow an acre of pot it is reasonable by any stretch of the imagination to assume you are growing it with the intent to distribute it illegally. Get a commercial growers permit and boom, no more 3am raids. If you aren't doing doing anything illegal, then it won't happen.   Shits and giggles, i want to grow an acre of weed to help stave off global warming and have a swimming pool full of home-brewed beer for my own amusement. What concern is it to anyone else what I do with my time and money?   Nobody's, go for it. Brew and grow to your hearts content. If it is for purely personal consumption then by all means, go for it. That is a lot of your wasted time and money for beer that will go bad very quickly.   Whoever wanted to I guess. You really think the government is what keeps ""sketchy"" stuff out of your beer? During prohibition they killed an estimated 10,000 intentionally substituting methanol for ethanol in industrial applications.   The government doesn't keep anything out of my beer. Responsible, law abiding citizens who follow regulations and proper procedures like NOT substituting methanol is what keeps my beer consumable. By issuing a license, the government is providing documented proof that a person/organization who is brewing my beer is a responsible law abiding citizen.   The reason sketchy stuff is in any products is precisely because of prohibition. ""Spice"" was only created to try and avoid detection from government agents, without prohibition there's no reason to fake anything. If you have concerns that your neighbor is brewing wood alcohol then don't drink it.   Exactly remove prohibition for weed and provide me proof that the person I am buying it from is a legitimate producer and isn't putting harmful substances in his product. That proof cannot be ""Because I said so."" It needs to come from a third, objective, party. If my neighbor is the one doing it, I likely am going to know if he is trustworthy enough to drink his home-made beverage.  I agree that prohibition of pot is not protecting anyone from danger. It is a cash cow for illegal drug producers and legalization is going to be the best way to get it off the streets and into responsible citizens who enjoy consuming it. However we do need regulation because not everyone is responsible enough to be trusted to make proper decisions."
Colorado,30esqa,codfos,2,Fri Mar 27 01:42:52 2015 UTC,I just went back to see the rest of the comments in this thread only to realize that you had exactly the same argument as me with exactly the same asshole. Theres no convincing people like him.
Colorado,30esqa,nealio1000,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:30:36 2015 UTC,I was in it more for the sake of arguing and articulating my thoughts and less for the sake of changing his mind or convincing him. I won't change his just like he won't change mine.
Colorado,30esqa,codfos,1 point,Fri Mar 27 01:40:12 2015 UTC,"It's an arbitrary degree of prohibition. I understand that there's a difference, I just don't agree that it's as big of a difference as you seem to believe it is. I don't want there to be any reason, short of violence, for anyone to have violence used against them. Arbitrary limits are a threat of violence for no articulate-able reason (except a desire for control).   Let's remove the limit that I can drive while being under the influence of alcohol. Deregulate that into non existence. While we are at it, lets remove regulations that say how fast I can drive. Oh, and lets not for get to remove the regulation on how much I can charge you interest on your auto loan. I'll need your base payment plus 150% interest on it next month. By the way, we also removed minimum wage too. Regulation is not always a means of prohibition. It can be used to prohibit certain things but it can be used to encourage and grow whatever as well. We regulate things to make them either safer for our society as a whole or to facilitate growth. Do you enjoy not having to boil your water to drink it or enjoy knowing that your food was prepared at your favorite restaurant by workers who wash their hands and clean their dishes?   No, believing that government actions keep things out of the hands of children, parents do that. Making pot illegal hasn't done anything to keep weed out of kids hands.    That is not naive at all. No parent is perfect. I would LOVE to find a parent that knows what their child is doing 100% of the time all the time beyond age 10. Have them tell me what they had for a snack at their friends after school or what they traded their Snack Pack for at lunch in the cafeteria. Not to mention the parents who would send their children off to school or a friends house with edible items because of the blind belief some people have for its medicinal qualities. Especially when kids get into middle and high school and spend time hanging out unsupervised with their friends. Yes, there are attentive parents who know who their kids friends are, but there are also kids who seem good and upstanding but really aren't. Making pot illegal wont keep it out of the kids hands who are motivated enough to buy it and want to. Or adults for that matter. But it will keep the ones who are tempted enough to buy it legally and shouldn't be allowed to.   Or water plants with it, or whatever, vodka makes a good cleaning supply honestly. The point is exactly what your saying, these arbitrary limits do nothing to prevent someone from going over, so what's the point of having them? All they do is risk violent police action to prevent... what exactly? that's the question. I'd rather have there be no risk of violent state action and not have any arbitrary limits. As you said, most people wouldn't bother making so much so what's your concern? The only real risk is that someone in law enforcement gets it in their head that the guy with the garage brew set up is ""brewing too much"" and plans violent action, then they break in, potentially kill someone and get killed... then it turns out he wasn't... it's happened... so why even risk that? what's the point?  What's it matter though? Why is it worth it to risk involving law enforcement with something that you yourself have stated there's no real danger in going over an arbitrary limit.   The limits AREN'T created on a whim or random choice. Sure, you or I are are responsible enough to go over that limit of growing and production with out harming else. Now, lets say we aren't the upstanding, law-abiding citizens we are and we are trying to distribute that product. Let's say we run a multi-million dollar operation and we get arrested.  There is NO WAY we can say ""Yes I made that money in investments(which we really got from selling it illegally) and I plan to consume these 100,000 pot plants by my self. The point to have them is to hold those that are not following the law accountable for their actions. How do you do that? You set a reasonable expectation of what an average user could produce and consume on their own through gathering information and data from those who actually to.   Regulation enforcement has gotten people killed... and when something can get someone killed forgive me for thinking there should be a really good reason for it.   The very same regulation enforcement has saved peoples lives as well by way of setting DUI limits on alcohol. It has gotten people killed because they were either dumb enough to break the law and fight back then expect not to get caught, or they were in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people. The people who were invaded mistakenly are a very small statistic compared to the ones who have submitted peacefully after they were caught. You only hear about the mistaken ones because it is what the public eats for breakfast.   A completely arbitrary edict which you know very well has more to do with what special interests want than any one person. I believe that if you're going to threaten violence against someone you should have a better reason than ""the law says so."" The law said you can own another human being not too long ago, it's no measure of morality. But you haven't justified it being illegal though, which is what I'm asking. Laws are arbitrary, they come and go and change, they aren't a measure of morality.   If it is arbitrary then why did you quote it? It has nothing to do with special interests and everything to do with us as citizens prove what we claim. If we claim that it is a 100% safe drug that cannot harm a flea, it is up to us to prove that. If we claim we do not need regulation and oversight, then it is up to us to prove that.  The ""law says so"" is a perfectly valid reason because we, as a society, are the ones responsible on who gets to write those laws. That is the justification. Those laws that those who represent us wrote. Then we pay taxes for people to enforce the laws OUR representatives create. If we don't want special interest groups to be influencing our laws then why don't we overcome that as a society and remove that from our political scheme. Have you talked to your Senator or congressman and voiced your concerns as their constituent? That is up to us. It doesn't happen overnight. We can't shut down corruption instantly.   Basically what you're saying is ""Might makes right""   Might doesn't make right. Majority vote does. What we decide as a society does. We, as a society, decided that these things were dangerous and illegal long ago and now it is up to us to fix that. One of the ways we can do that is regulating it at first then ease off as we learn more about how our incredibly intricate and complex society treats it.    There are plenty of ""wrong house"" raids and enough people killed in them to know that isn't the case. Anything that permits violence isn't going to be limited to the ""right people"" there are going to be innocent bystanders killed, that's just the nature of uncertainty. So if whatever violent action you're going to justify is going to get innocent people killed you better have a good reason for said action in the first place... but I'm not hearing any.   Exactly, illegal drugs are exactly something that has historically incited violence and caused innocent bystanders to be killed. If I am an illegal drug distributor you bet your bottom dollar I will have protection and there will be violence when my illegal business is disrupted by force. Either by competing business or a government agency. The reason that operation is illegal is that we said so, as a society, long ago. It is up to us to change that.    False, plenty of people have been ""legally"" killed for being suspected of one crime or another, only to be exonerated of said ""crime"" after they're already dead. All I want is to be secure in my person, house, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, and if a warrant is going to be issued, one that risks harm to me, I better of harmed someone else first to deserve it. But it feels like too many people have to strong of a desire to control others to hope for that.   Exactly, illegal drugs are exactly something that has historically incited violence and caused innocent bystanders to be killed. If I am an illegal drug distributor you bet your bottom dollar I will have protection and there will be violence when my illegal business is disrupted by force. The reason that operation is illegal is that we said so, as a society, long ago. It is up to us to change that.   You really think regular people would just put menthol in people's drinks just for the hell of it? and you want to go to the only organization that has, on record, done exactly that, in order to protect you from it? ""Law abiding"" isn't a measure of morality, history has shown that people have hidden behind ""the law"" for plenty of violent and selfish reasons.   I'm not saying regular people would. I'm saying people who are motivated to harm me would, and those people are kept away by not being able to obtain a license because they have a history of harming people. And I buy my products based on who is legally allowed to sell those products.    Potlucks and bake sales must be nightmarish for you....   The ad hominem hurts... Selling your whatever at a bake sale is entirely different from selling it at a store. Bake sales/potlucks are almost always small communities of people who either know each other.   We elect the organization with the worse track record for proper decisions. We elect the ones who wrote the law that allows such lobbying. If you don't like who has been elected to write these laws and represent you then make an effort to work with them and what they are doing or make an effort to get someone else elected.  There will rarely be a regulation that is universally fair to all parties. But it is a start in getting where we want to be as a society. There is far more would like to say but I have run out of spac"
Colorado,30esqa,codfos,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:08:41 2015 UTC,"And if those people who brew their own beer or grow their own tobacco do so outside of local regulations, don't pay taxes, launder their profits, and ship their product over state lines in to areas where their product  isn't legal, you can bet they'd be arrested, too.  There's a difference between a home brewer making a batch of home brewed beer to enjoy and maybe share with friends, and a large-scale moonshiner who then ships their product across state lines. Similarly, there's a difference  between growing a few plants for yourself and a collection of grow  ops shipping millions of dollars worth of marijuana to other states."
Colorado,30esqa,megman13,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:25:22 2015 UTC,"The questions was if I thought they were victims, yes, if a law is written in such a way that enforcement of the law with cause more harm than if the ""crime"" was simply permitted to take place then the people are victims. I know, people who don't pay their ""protection"" money are likely to get their knee caps cracked. I consider that being a flaw in the law, rather than people.  Legally justified, morally reprehensible   Clarification, please: It almost seems like you're trying to equate regulated/taxed legalization with extortion (and to some extent, also prohibition, as this analogy is also used when discussing prohibition). Is this correct?   There's less of a difference than a lot of people try to claim imo.   -A few differences: Making a profit/operating a business without paying your fair due of taxes. Not having to comply with local ordinances, regulations, etc designed to ensure quality of life for all citizens (I'm sure  this one will get me flack, but there's a reason certain businesses cannot operate within certain distances of schools, follow environmental regulations, etc). Not having to comply with basic sanitation/health standards (moonshining is a nice parallel here).    I consider anyone who is harmed, who did not first harm someone else, to be a victim. It's not a popular opinion as people seem to want to be control freaks and sit on their moral high horses at the same time.   ""Harm""  is a relative term. These folks are making a profit outside the law, and as such aren't paying their fair share of taxes- harming the local community. They're harming legitimate growers by operating outside the same standards that legitimate businesses are bound by, and damaging the reputation of the industry as a whole. Without knowing specifics, there is also the possibility of harm to the community for reasons mentioned above (failure to abide by health/environmental standards, for example).   But my sense of right and wrong demands consistency.   So then, should alcohol/tobacco be completely de-regulated, or is it acceptable for moonshiners or tobacco growers who operate outside of the law of their local communities to simply keep doing what they're doing?   edit  To clarify, I am not in any way trying to say that people who grow their six plants at home should be regulated any more than a  home brewer should- that's not what the original article is about. The original article is about a multi-million dollar set of grow ops exporting large quantities of marijuana across state lines. Apples and oranges..."

Colorado,30esqa,raiderato,6,Fri Mar 27 06:34:46 2015 UTC,I highly doubt one single garage sale will deal with millions of dollars. Where there are many people operating businesses valued over a million dollars here. If there were no oversight people would abuse the system. Colorado would end up getting much less tax revenue and you end up hurting a state that put a lot on the line to defy the federal government.

I support legalization but I think you need to grow up a bit and realize it can never be some completely laissez-faire style industry.   Then treat it like every other industry. There's no need to treat adults like children. I never once mentioned tax avoidance, and never once advocated for a ""complete laissez-faire"" style marketplace.

Colorado Springs is actually a great place to live, but that's cool - keep propagating the myth that we're all a bunch of hyper-religious, zealot, loony toons."
Colorado,30a1up,bucknuggets,6,Wed Mar 25 23:38:36 2015 UTC,"FYI: Colorado Springs has a long tradition of electing racists, bigots and nutjobs:  http://www.csindy.com/coloradosprings/10-republicans-whove-kept-us-in-business/Content?oid=1120066  Betty Beedy might be the best of the bunch:   During her campaign, Beedy, who had close ties to anti-government militias, funneled much of her campaign cash into her and her husband's T-shirt business, not bothering to register with the state of Colorado. Once elected, this patriot charged county taxpayers for the mileage she accumulated driving to work downtown and back home to Calhan.  But her work extravagances were nothing compared to what came out of her mouth. She referred to single mothers who date as ""sluts"" and stridently opposed naming a stretch of concrete highway after civil rights hero Martin Luther King Jr., claiming he was nothing better than a philanderer. She boycotted a statewide gathering of politicians on moral grounds, complaining that the host mountain town of Crested Butte informally sponsors a ""ski naked"" day in the winter. (Beedy, notably, did not raise similar complaints when it came to traveling at taxpayer expense to the rural Hawaiian island of Kauai, notorious, among other things, for its nude beaches. The trip, Beedy explained, would enable her to learn invaluable tips that she could apply to her own rural eastern El Paso County district.)  Beedy's saucy tongue generated such controversy that she was invited to appear on a live national television show, where, composed as always, she informed her slack-jawed interviewer Starr Jones, an African-American woman, and the rest of the country, that only white people are normal."
Colorado,30a1up,TheMrNick,5,Thu Mar 26 00:18:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm well aware of that fact - but you should also know that Betty Beedy represented the same area that Klingenschmitt does now.  It is a part of town where Republicans outnumber Democrats 2 to 1, and anyone with an (R) next to their name on the ballot is virtually guaranteed to win.  Colorado Springs is a pretty big place with a lot of diversity.   One heavily skewed part of town does not represent the town as a whole."

Colorado,309kwc,DJ_Timelord13,3,Thu Mar 26 03:35:04 2015 UTC,"Sheriff's being elected is actually one of the things that makes them more representative of the people than a Police Department.    Police departments are hired and report to MAyors, and other officials.   Sheriff's are elected because when it comes to checks and balances they are one of the few people with the authority to overthrow local government that is out of control.   A County Coroner is actually next in line in terms of Authority to a Sheriff.   This does not mean an Under Sheriff, or Deputy with good experience couldn't be elected.   They actually could and often are.   Even if you went by RANK how would the initial candidates get there?   Who would decide who gets to be a sheriff?   How do you as a person participate in a recall or anything if they are no longer representative or protecting?    In a Sheriff's department due to the election YOU as a citizen of that county can participate in recalls, new elections, etc.    If it were not for elections none of that would be in your control.   Due to elections local governance is one of the few places your votes actually have a lot of impact.  EDIT: Not sure why this would be down voted.   That person must like being a slave.   Suggestion:  Get arrested, if you go to prison they will take care of you and make all of your decisions for you and you won't have any decision on who oversees things there.   By down voting me that seems to be what you're after.    So, I thought I'd let you know your Utopian society already exists.   It is called prison."

And the phrase ""alcohol and drugs"" needs to be completely eliminated from use in society. Alcohol is arguably the worst drug. It's killed an order of magnitude more people than even heroin.   Take my dorm for example, I occasionally smoke weed to help with my ptsd and depression and very occasionally take ecstasy for the same reason. Most of the time however I am studying or working.

The objective within our walls is to tighten up where evee we can, not have layoffs unless it's a contractor who's time is up (or contract is ending) and other unexpected dismissal.   I would say service companies boom-bust with their numbers far more drastically than ours (Halliburton, Schlumberger and Weatherford).  As far as other monies for external foundations and other stuff, I know we're still sponsoring habitat for humanity builds and a number of others (runs and races etc).  Since working there in 2011, I'm pretty pleased with the amount charitable giving, service projects and other stuff like that I get to participate in.   I hope those budgets don't get hit too hard, but inevitably, it will to some extent.  On a side note, of you ever have a chance to volunteer at RAFT or a habit build, DO IT.  Its extremely rewarding and you learn a lot about how those organizations operate.   If your company is looking for some more hand s on stuff for service and team building check them out."
Colorado,3028if,Rockies_oil,1 point,Tue Mar 24 12:57:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And the oil extraction companies like Anadarko are not going through the pain that companies like Haliburton are.  Anadarko extracts the oil. They are still producing, but at a much lower rate, to fulfill contracts that were made before oil prices dropped. They have enough cash reserves and inflow to cover most of their personnel, but new projects have been put on hold. It still makes more financial sense to keep people on for when the prices do go back up so you can respond quickly than to lay everyone off and have to go through a re-hiring process when prices go back up.  Companies like Haliburton service the machinery, companies extract oil for the commodities market, and companies that don't have contracts or an established infrastructure are really, really hurting right now."

Colorado,3028if,Improvinator,2,Tue Mar 24 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The energy industry requires a very specific set of conditions to be profitable.  If any part of it gets out of whack, it's a mess.  What would happen to coal power generation if a pollution standard were applied that tripled the price of burning coal?  All those miners and all those trains would be in trouble."
Colorado,3028if,Improvinator,4,Tue Mar 24 03:26:04 2015 UTC,"It costs a tremendous amount of money to drill an oil well.  Typical horizontal wells cost about $5,000,000 to drill and complete.  To raise this capital you need to go out and get funding.  Lenders calculate debt to company value to establish a borrowing base.  Oil and gas production also has operating costs on top of the initial capital costs.  Say $20 of every barrel is lifting cost and differentials.  So if oil price goes from $100 dollars a barrel ($80 profit) to $40 dollars per barrel ($20 profit) it is much more substantial than the price drop itself.  These pricing forecasts are put into reservoir models and the company value is calculated.  If the new evaluation is a lot lower, then the lender can resend the loan because of the reduced borrowing base.  Pretty much any industry would collapse with a drop in price of this magnitude.  What if you were selling cars for $10,000 each and then all of a sudden they dropped to $2,500 each?  You already have a lot full of cars you thought were worth 10k so all the money you leveraged to purchase the cars from the manufacturer is now debt and you are insolvent even if you sell what you have.  Oil is traditionally risky with boom and bust cycles.  Get over leveraged when prices fall and you can very quickly become insolvent.  Most of the value of any oil company is oil still in the ground.  This is not a monthly cashflow issue."

I could mention the complex and highly artistic drum rhythms that come from Africa.     I could argue that it's good that we're remembering our past, so we can avoid making the same mistakes. But no matter what I say, the team is still called The Niggers. That is unquestionably racist by the sheer nature of the name, no matter who put it in place or why. For this particular example, I think you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who does not find that racist.      For The Indians, however, it's a bit more subtle. We've been subjugating the various tribes of North America for even longer than the various tribes of Africa, but we've never had the kind of massive public opinion war that we did with slavery. Simply put, we're less aware of it. (""We"" being white Americans, of which I am one)      With all that in mind, I have a friend named Soaring Eagle (yes, that's his real name) who identifies himself as ""Indian"" despite actually being Blackfoot. There's obviously wiggle room on the individual level, but that does not mean we can treat the population as a whole like that.    TL;DR - it's just as offensive as any other hate speech, but it doesn't jump out at you as much because the PC police have never pursued it as aggressively."
Colorado,301syb,iridescentcosmicslop,6,Thu Mar 26 03:11:14 2015 UTC,It's embarrassing that you think a racial slur makes for a good mascot. Your pride comes from the accomplishments of yourself and the school not a name or mascot. Yes I and the citizens of this state can dictate what others say or do if it's a federally funded school.
Colorado,301syb,303uru,2,Tue Mar 24 22:08:01 2015 UTC,I think the fact that we still refer to Native American's as being from India is also an issue. Some guy hundreds of years ago didn't know where the hell he was and some how it has lasted this long.
Colorado,301syb,Asatora,9,Tue Mar 24 15:28:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah but even most Native Americans refer to themselves as Indians also, I can't say that I've ever heard any other Natives having a problem with it.  I think that an even bigger issue is the fact that ""lost guy"" has a holiday named after him, despite being responsible for the murder and enslavement of hundreds of thousands of people."
Colorado,301syb,VelociJupiter,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:58:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe we should start using the correct terms. Call the Native Americans ""Americans"", and call everybody else ""New Comers"" or ""Immigrants"".  This will surely be fun."

Say what you want about Coors, but it's not bad when it's free, especially while you're still acclimating after flying in from sea level."

Colorado,2zljoj,tmtreat,16,Thu Mar 19 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"Assuming the liquor store next door even has a decent selection. By my place, I have a King Soopers across the street, and two tiny, super shitty liquor stores with terrible selections, terrible prices, and a scary crowd within walking distance. Unless I'm getting cheap beer and liquor for a party, I have to go tooling down the road a few miles to go to an actually-decent store with a good selection. Whereas when I lived in MT, even Walmart had a passable selection of beer, and Albertsons and Safeway had great ones, including a massive craft selection. Not to mention they have a killer craft scene up there, so that's not the issue.  Why are we all obligated to keep going to inconvenient places and paying inflated prices just to protect liquor store owners? If they're actually good at what they do, they'll be fine. Besides, if I'm understanding these bills right, the liquor stores will still have their reign over hard alcohol sales too, so its not even an issue."
Colorado,2zljoj,frostycakes,8,Thu Mar 19 19:37:21 2015 UTC,"Probably the most obvious harm to consumers is in the form of prices. Although Colorado has relatively low sin taxes, retail liquor is more expensive than other states with higher taxes simply because of the unnecessary infrastructure created by the three-tier system, especially with the third tier being individual proprietorships.  There's also the fact that consumers miss out on goods and services that simply can't be offered under current law, such as gift baskets with wine, organic beer you could otherwise get at Whole Foods, private label brands from Trader Joe's, etc."
Colorado,2zljoj,TywinsChamberpot,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:40:31 2015 UTC,"Although Colorado has relatively low sin taxes, retail liquor is more expensive than other states with higher taxes   Do you have a source on this? I don't disagree, I'd just love to see the numbers if you have a link handy."
Colorado,2zljoj,driverdave,3,Thu Mar 19 20:08:08 2015 UTC,"It's a partisan source, but from Googling, Spirits Excise Tax Rates by State, 2014, we are #46. (#1 having the highest spirit taxed.)  For the sake of comparison, I also looked at a non-state semi-craft beer: Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. For a six pack at Argonaut, it's $9. Our closest neighbor, tax-wise, would be Texas. From a quick check on Google Shopper, in Dallas, it's a mere $7.25.  That's a 25% difference, give or take."
Colorado,2zljoj,Zamicol,8,Fri Mar 20 00:14:34 2015 UTC,"it artificially reduces competition.  when there is less competition, you will generally see an increase in prices, a decrease in service, etc... since there is no incentive for the business to do the opposite. they have no reason to.  to rewind a bit, i'd ask the opposite question. how does this regulation help anyone? that is, besides the owner of a liquor store. i don't see any benefit to consumers or a good reason for this regulation to exist.  my guess is someone (or a group) who benefited from this regulation paid off a politician a long time ago to get this regulation in place."

Colorado,2zljoj,ld115,0,Fri Mar 20 06:20:18 2015 UTC,"I hope they keep it out supermarkets. It would hurt a ton a small businesses otherwise.  In a perfect world I wish there never would have been these strange Colorado Blue Laws that set up this system. But they've been here forever and set up (albiet odd at times) statewide economy on how liquor is sold and regulated - and now at this point, reverting it would be pretty harmful to small businesses all around the state (liquor stores)."
Colorado,2zljoj,TywinsChamberpot,12,Thu Mar 19 17:30:40 2015 UTC,"What about the potential for other small businesses to exist that aren't allowed to right now? For example, I imagine a place that sells wine and cheese pairings for take-out would do really well. Imagine your favorite cheese store selling wine to pair with it."
Colorado,2zljoj,raiderato,3,Thu Mar 19 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"I can imagine at least 10 liquor stores closing for 1 new ""wine and cheese"" type store.   A super market will be able to give consumers cheaper product, yes but the only liquor stores that will be able to compete are the grocery store-sized liquor stores. Small stores will be forced to close down.  The type of store you imagine only caters to a very small few where prices would run upwards of $100 per person. And placement of which would only work well in a place like Boulder or Denver.   Then there's all the laid off employees. You could argue that those who lost their jobs could just go to another place that sells liquor, but that's pretty much akin to telling them to cut their wages at least in half and lose any benefits and job security.  Liquor laws do need updating, but it needs to be done in a way that's not going to screw over probably 50% of independently owned stores in the first year alone."
Colorado,2zljoj,Zamicol,6,Thu Mar 19 20:25:06 2015 UTC,"Arguably, those 10 liquor stores that close for the ""wine and cheese"" type store aren't carrying their weight, economically.  Yes, there are boutique liquor stores -- like Mondo Vino -- that offer a level of expertise and service that grocery stores can't compete with. I imagine those will continue to do just as well. There are also the warehouse liquor stores, like Argonaut and Applejack, which will also do well.  Who will hurt are the mediocre liquor stores that setup next to anchor grocery stores in strip malls, as well as the ""dive"" liquor stores on Federal, Colfax, and Broadway. Those stores will suffer, but arguably, if we're going to dedicate our money to keeping those employees paid, shouldn't we do it directly through welfare money instead of subsidizing through an economic distortion businesses that shouldn't really exist?  I would argue for an alternative where we recognize the fact that liquor stores have made an investment in a certain regulatory scheme, and if that regulatory scheme changes, there should be something to soften the blow: for example, require grocery stores to ""buy out"" neighboring liquor stores before applying for a license. Impose that requirement with a distant sunset: say, 15 years.  But, this model where no one who sells liquor can sell groceries and visa versa is just unworkable and ridiculous. We need an exit strategy from our current regulatory system, and I don't see liquor store proprietors as even willing to compromise, so I'm inclined to side with the grocery stores."
Colorado,2zljoj,TywinsChamberpot,6,Fri Mar 20 00:07:31 2015 UTC,"I have to say that I agree. I think the supermarkets make a good argument, but I just prefer or system of small, family owned liquor stores. Most of the stores I frequent are clearly run by first generation immigrants and their families, which I really enjoy seeing.   While I can see the economic argument, I just like our current system and hope it stays. I'll also say that when I shop for liquor at Target, the selection is seriously narrow compared to any hole in the wall liquor store I would go to otherwise."
Colorado,2zljoj,Zamicol,4,Thu Mar 19 17:49:17 2015 UTC,I've frequented these types of stores in each state I've ever lived in. They exist even when grocers can sell a full variety of beers.

And you're right... In a couple decades, not only will the Pueblo chemical weapons depot be a residential community, but wherever they disposed of the stuff likely will be too.

Colorado,2zidi0,autowikibot,2,Thu Mar 19 04:37:07 2015 UTC,"Radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant:       The Rocky Flats Plant, a former U.S. nuclear weapons production facility located about 15 miles northwest of Denver, caused radioactive (primarily plutonium, americium, and uranium) contamination within and outside its boundaries.  The contamination primarily resulted from two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969 (plutonium is pyrophoric and shavings can spontaneously combust) and from wind-blown plutonium that leaked from barrels of radioactive waste. Much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational life of the plant from 1952 to 1992, from smaller accidents and from normal operational releases of plutonium particles too small to be filtered. Prevailing winds from the plant carried airborne contamination south and east, into populated areas northwest of Denver.

There are 191 public school districts in Colorado with similar budgets.   $15m / 191 districts = $78k per district. My k-12 district has 17 schools in it, so that's $4.6k per school.

Colorado,2zds26,chedda,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:16:01 2015 UTC,"Go (game):       Go (simplified Chinese: 围棋; traditional Chinese: 圍棋; pinyin: wéiqí, Japanese: 囲碁 igo,  literal meaning: ""encircling game"", Korean: 바둑 baduk ) is a board game involving two players that originated in ancient China more than 2,500 years ago. It was considered one of the four essential arts of a cultured Chinese scholar in antiquity. Its earliest written reference dates back to the Confucian Analects.  There is significant strategy involved in the game, and the number of possible games is vast (10761 compared, for example, to the 10120 possible in chess),  despite its relatively simple rules.  The two players alternately place black and white playing pieces, called ""stones"", on the vacant intersections (""points"") of a board with a 19x19 grid of lines. Beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards,  and archaeological evidence shows that game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17×17 grid. By the time the game had spread to Korea and Japan in about the 5th and 7th centuries AD respectively, however, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard.   The objective of the game—as the translation of its name implies—is to have surrounded a larger total area of the board with one's stones than the opponent by the end of the game,  although this result typically involves many more intricacies than simply using surrounding areas directly.  Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones may be removed from the board if captured—this is done by surrounding an opposing stone or group of stones by occupying all orthogonally-adjacent points.  The two players place stones alternately until they reach a point at which neither player wishes to make another move; the game has no set ending conditions beyond this. When a game concludes, the territory is counted along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second) to determine the winner.  Games may also be won by resignation.  As of mid-2008, there were well over 40 million Go players worldwide, the overwhelming majority of them living in East Asia.  As of May 2012 [update], the International Go Federation has a total of 74 member countries and four Association Members covering multiple countries.

Colorado,2zdm16,mario_meowingham,12,Tue Mar 17 18:32:39 2015 UTC,You only should tube the river as it goes through golden. Anywhere else upstream and you will die. Plain and simple. It's too fast too big and full of rebar. If you really want to get on that section go to any of the rafting companies in Idaho Springs.
Colorado,2zdm16,SaltyPancakes,2,Tue Mar 17 19:00:30 2015 UTC,Do the rafting companies take you down through the canyon? And how the heck did rebar get into the creek?
Colorado,2zdm16,SaltyPancakes,5,Tue Mar 17 20:12:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah clear creek canyon is a stout V. I highly recommend it. It's literally the best part of my job. Simple answer to all the rebar and concrete in the river, CDOT and I 70 don't give a fuck."

Colorado,2zdm16,JonConisDaarioisBenj,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:11:11 2015 UTC,The first tunnel on Rte 6 as you head up into the mountains.  That's about as far up as you can safely start.  I prefer to start here as it's walkable from the end of the ride at Coors.
Colorado,2zdm16,raiderato,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:27:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's the best spot to start.   BUT, it's closer to light white water rafting from that far up. If your used to a mellow float - this is not it. It's fun as hell, but you need to be moderately aware of the flow of the river.   Most important part of the whole process is having good river shoes and an appropriate tube."
Colorado,2zdm16,JingJang,8,Wed Mar 18 16:27:41 2015 UTC,"I have always tubed in the downtown area of clear creek. I wouldn't recommend going up the canyon, or trying to tube without a life jacket during peak run off. Believe it or not, people die tubing. Also be careful if you are drinking beer, the golden cops hand out open container tickets all summer long."
Colorado,2zdm16,JingJang,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:50:43 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the info. As i said, i have heard about people tubing clear creek but knew nothing about where or what the conditions are like."

I don't believe it's illegal, but it's incredibly stupid. Best case you'll be plucked from the water by the authorities (police, ranger, etc.) and scolded, worst case you're dead.  Stick to Golden for ""tubing"". If you want to go rafting, call a company in Idaho Springs."

Colorado,2zdm16,LetsGetMotarded,4,Tue Mar 17 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"Another fun run in Denver is the South Platte below Chatfield.  You put-in at South Platte Park right immediately North of 470 (There's a small parking area and a good put-in).  You can set up a shuttle with a vehicle at the Union Chutes ( Just west of Santa Fe on Union in Englewood at Centennial Park)   Union Chutes is actually a white-water park.    This run is 4-5 miles and takes 3-4 hours. You'll want the flow to be at least 350cfs.  (Ideally 500-600 is great). I wouldn't do it with a flow over 800cfs.  WEAR A LIFE JACKET.  Check the flow here: http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=06710247.  Don't do it after a good rain. The South Platte collects a lot of run-off from the urban areas around it so we usually wait till the flow is 400-600 in the early summer when they let water through Chatfield.  This way you have good water - that is not too gross.   Its a great run. The first park is so pretty you barely realize you'r in the city, but by the time you reach the Union Chutes you'll know :)  There are several man-made class 3 ""rapids"".  All are easily by-passed using the take-outs/put-ins which are almost all concrete so you can't miss them.  If you are up for adventure you can try them on your tube.  You should probably have a helmet for such shenanigans but I admit I don't wear one.    Save some energy for the Union Chutes, you may want to run them a few times.  You can walk the west side of the river along (but not ON the bike path - there's room for river users there).   I've floated this run dozens of times and despite it's location it's actually one of my favorites. Bonus is that you won't have the crowds that you have in Golden or Boulder and we've never had anyone say anything about having beers on the river (Aside from some golfers that asked us to stop and give them some)."
Colorado,2zdm16,eta_carinae_311,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:12:03 2015 UTC,Wow this is awesome info. Thanks for sharing! Maybe i will see you out there this summer
Colorado,2zdm16,eta_carinae_311,3,Wed Mar 18 19:25:33 2015 UTC,"No Problem.  We float a separate tube with beer and a pirate flag so keep an eye out for us.   I've got a few more runs around the state if you're interested - including a different stretch of Clear Creek which I had forgotten that I recorded. Since you originally asked specifically about Clear Creek:  Clear Creek:  Put-in = I-70 and Youngfield (Wheatridge Green Belt, Youngfield Parking lot), Take Out, Marshall St, (Creekside Park).  This isn't a lazy river!  Wear a life-jacket, wear a helmet and check the numbers.  We have done this run three times and found the Ideal flow is about 650cfs-800cfs as measured by this gauge:  http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?06719505  Note, the gauge is actaully located in Golden but we have used this as our metric for determining what flow works.  You need to exit the river at least three time along this run: At 44th, At Wadsworth, and at Kipling.  The last time we did the run, these were signed along the river but floods may have destroyed the signs.  At Kipling the take out is because there isn't enough clearance on the river to float under the overpass.  This take out was well signed but it should be since its deadly if you don't get out.  The other two were due to big obstacles (Class 4+) Not suitable for tubes.  There's a Class three Rapids right at Wadsworth along I-70.  It is doable but very difficult. A couple of us have made it through without swimming.    I recorded this and kept it in my records because there are certain folks in our group that enjoy the challenge. I prefer the other end of the spectrum - more ""beer floats""  This run is challenging - and honestly dangerous but it IS doable.  Its also fun in a kayak.   EDIT:  Forgot to mention that Clear Creeks is COLD compared with the Platte.  This run has a lot of shade from trees which makes it even colder :)"
Colorado,2zdm16,JonConisDaarioisBenj,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:30:09 2015 UTC,"Man this is invaluable information. I would be happy to buy you a beer or two if you wanted to sit down sometime and share your favorite routes. Being a beginner, i am definitely more on the ""beer floats"" end of the spectrum too."
Colorado,2zdm16,LetsGetMotarded,2,Wed Mar 18 21:01:01 2015 UTC,"No problem man.  I started writing down what dates we floated and what the river levels were each time after we got ""butt-bashed"" by rocks one time.  I've been tracking it ever since.    I'm glad to help.  Tubing is super fun.  Only thing more fun are multi-day rafting trips!    My favorite run in the State is the Gunnison River:  Put in at the public launch at Garlic Mikes (Google it and look for the very obvious put-in across the highway).  Float down to the White Water Park.  You can do it from 700-1500cfs.  1000-1500 is ideal.  The water is COLD and when I say COLD I mean that its a tradition to do two shots at the put in to just start to get into the spirit of things. Make sure it is SUNNY and get on the river by 11:00. If it looks like it's going to cloud over - don't do it.   The plus-side is that its SUPER clean and clear water. We've seen monster trout in there. You float right along side the Palisades on the west side of town - 800 foot breccia walls.  VERY scenic.  We've seen deer on every run along the river. The white water park is fantastic and as long as the sun is shining its some of the best water anywhere.  Go in late July or early August for the hottest daytime temperatures (by ""hot"" we are talking low 80's).    If you want more you can float from the white water park down to ""McCabes"" which is take-out located a few more miles west off of Highway 50.  The lower stretch isn't as scenic but its still really pretty and there's fun river navigation.  If you really like tubing - this is the stretch to try. If I can only get in one run for the summer - this is the one I make happen.  Aside from the cold water - its the perfect beginner run.  The river is wide enough to make some mistakes but fast enough that you definitely have to learn how to read it so you can drink beers efficiently.    Make sure you have a DD - the beers disappear on this one!"

I'm currently getting my Master in Zoo/Aquarium/Shelter management at Colorado State University and we talk about this place a lot.  The first problem is the guy in charge. He is completely against using science to manage ""his"" animals. The cats have giant pits that the cats can use as dens. These pits are not cleaned or monitored, so who knows what goes on in there.  The manager does use any positive conditioning training on the animals. He believes it ""de-wilds"" them, even though they are never going to be wild again.  We have also taken a look at their financials, and they threw an equivalent of several months of operating costs into rescuing these lions.   These lions that are being rescued are definitely going to be in a better place, but it is still far from ideal. I am not saying do not support this place, because at this point they absolutely need the money. This just kind of shows how this place is managed, the about double the amount of lions they have with this rescue, but they don't have the necessary funds to support the population.   I don't mean to come off as an asshole here, I just want to bring their questionable practices to light."

The snowpack helps with so many things and if we have a warm spring (winter is done at this point in time) then the snow will melt quicker than it should leaving us with a VERY dry late July and August which will turn everything into a tinder box.

Still, nobody seemed that discouraged (certainly not in my conservative family...).  I guess purposely derailing negotiations over dangerous nuclear testing is where the buck stops. Sheesh."

And not just any woman, but an empty-headed Alaskan hick- a cheerleader with a hunting rifle. And, of course, when that didn't work, they settled for a Mormon whose principles couldn't have been more for sale if the guy'd had a price tag on him.  And now, they're faced with a choice and can't decide which compromise disgusts them the least- the pale Cuban from Florida or the fat mobster from New Jersey.

United States of article  Ratification:       In the US, the treaty power is a coordinated effort between the Executive branch and the Senate. The President may form and negotiate, but the treaty must be advised and consented to by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. Only after the Senate approves the treaty can the President ratify it. Once a treaty is ratified, it becomes binding on all the states under the Supremacy Clause. While the United States House of Representatives does not vote on it at all, the requirement for Senate advice and consent to ratification makes it considerably more difficult in the US than in other democratic republics to rally enough political support for international treaties. Also, if implementation of the treaty requires the expenditure of funds, the House of Representatives may be able to block, or at least impede, such implementation by refusing to vote for the appropriation of the necessary funds.

Colorado,2yxdue,ChieferSutherland,4,Sat Mar 14 05:05:11 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand, who decided to start saying that like it's an insult? ""I have a pen and a phone"" is a pretty generic thing to say, it doesn't even really imply apathy when taken out of context like that, let alone when it's taken with context. To say he's ""the 'I have a pen and phone' president"" is more than a little stupid, aside from it obviously intended to be inflammatory it's totally unclear what you meant by it. There's no substance behind it. It's just half assed name calling.  Edit: added more after I thought of it."
Colorado,2yxdue,cazz14159,-4,Sat Mar 14 05:15:08 2015 UTC,"The context is that he is going to act WITHOUT Congress, i.e. overstepping authority vested to him by the Constitution. There is no other meaning to that statement.    If Congress doesn't want to vote for the President's agenda, then tough shit. It's not their job to capitulate to whatever he wants. That's not how checks and balances work."
Colorado,2yxdue,ChieferSutherland,3,Sat Mar 14 05:58:14 2015 UTC,"So fist, as long as we're talking about overstepping authority, how is this letter not doing exactly that?  And you may not like it now that it's being used for something you don't support, but thanks to the patriot act, and the executive powers that were expanded under Bush, the president isn't overstepping his authority at all.  But that's true, that isnt how checks and balances should work. The system is broken."
Colorado,2yxdue,cazz14159,-1,Sat Mar 14 06:07:13 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, the letter doesn't accomplish anything nor intend to. It has no power to do anything. With that being said, it may run against traditions but it doesn't actually overstep any legal authority. It was a stupid letter and kind of embarrassing but really that's all it is.   I agree with you that the president should take the lead on foreign policy since it's always been that way. Like him or not, he's the face of our government to the world.     When I said that Obama oversteps his authority I was referring to his executive amnesty actions after the democrats lost the Senate in November. He also has changed parts of the ACA such as delaying the employer mandate. The president can't just change laws that Congress voted on and he already signed.   edit: added a line to the first paragraph"

You don't get to nerf the world because of some inconsiderate assholes. This ruling is fucking stupid as hell. Ban it from school, hospitals, and privately owned public venues (bars/resturants).

Oh come on, all the other examples are fine, but sometimes peoples family members die or get serious surgery and you have to fly across the country to see them. Sometimes people move across country to get a better job to support their family, and it's easier to fly 4 hours with a baby than drive 3 days. It's also FAR riskier to the baby's safety to drive for that long. I have had to fly with a baby for both reasons, and had asshats shoot me looks for it both times. Some stranger felt the need to shoot me a nasty look because my father-in-law was about to die.  So fuck you people who think babies are unacceptable. An airplane is public transportation. Is someone an asshole for bringing a baby on a bus or train? No. If you don't want to deal with babies, fly business class or something. Bring headphones...hell, they let you buy them on the plane! They are only fussy because their ears hurt. Any person who hears a fussy baby in pain and only thinks of themselves is the selfish one, for not taking into consideration the life circumstances of the parents that made flying with a baby their only option. It's not like it's pleasant for the parent - to them hearing their child cry is 10x worse than for you, and it's in their lap. Have a little empathy for other people's situations. You know you're going to be on a plane for X amount of hours. You're the asshole for not planning if you feel entitled to a noise-free flight.  Sorry...end rant from young parent who actually likes kids. Overall good points...it's stupid to ban any of this because assholes gonna asshole, I guess."

You said:   You can go outside with all the other smokers   And, as the article states, you can't just go outside to smoke.

Are people really that bothered by smoke or vapor on a golf course that they need to make it a crime?    It doesn't matter if it doesn't smell or has no public health benefit, people don't like it.   This is the lamest possible excuse for criminalizing behavior. You don't like it? Too fucking bad.

Colorado,2ypiai,XooDumbLuckooX,-4,Wed Mar 11 21:18:45 2015 UTC,"no, it's a risk reward decision.  personally, and i think as a society, we have determined that rewards from driving outweigh the risks involved. and there are laws that protect me from unnecessary risk from others, such as driving while under the influence. still, there is an inherent risk involved in driving that i am free to assume. i can also chose not to drive if i feel those risks are too high.  the risk reward from secondhand smoke is a little different. i get no reward from your secondhand smoke, and assume unwanted risk."
Colorado,2ypiai,driverdave,12,Wed Mar 11 22:15:48 2015 UTC,"I get no reward from someone else driving. And you get no measurable risk from someone else smoking on a golf course or running path. And you absolutely get no risk from someone else using an e-cigarette outside. The bans against smoking inside privately-owned but publicly-accessible buildings is understandable, as second hand smoke in confined areas actually carries with it health risks. But banning smoking outside has absolutely nothing to do with risk. It has to do with people not wanting to smell someone else's smoke. And if this is the case, then perfume and cologne and Axe body spray, et al. should be banned (which I would be more in favor of than a smoking ban).   I hate the smell of tobacco smoke, but I'm not delusional enough to think that someone smoking outdoors somehow affects my health."

Colorado,2ypiai,XooDumbLuckooX,2,Wed Mar 11 23:05:31 2015 UTC,"you disagree with the golf course ban. i'm likely to agree with you, although i don't golf, so i honestly don't know how people group together there.  do you agree with smoking bans in densely used outdoor public spaces?  or do you oppose all outdoor smoking bans?"
Colorado,2ypiai,JD-King,6,Thu Mar 12 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"i don't golf, so i honestly don't know how people group together there.   They walk around huge open fields of short grass in small groups.   do you agree with smoking bans in densely used outdoor public spaces?   Not particularly. I understand the rationale behind banning smoking within X feet of a public entrance to a building, though I would argue this is related to the nuisance of the smell and has nothing to do with public health or safety. But I understand its rationale, and I wouldn't fight very vociferously against such a ban.    or do you oppose all outdoor smoking bans?   I'm not against bans of things based on public nuisance per se, I just wish people would be upfront about their reasoning. Banning smoking in an outdoor public place has nothing to do with the health effects of second hand smoke, but with the smell of it. If people don't want to smell smoke, that's an understandable argument, I just wish they would frame it that way instead of claiming some illusory health risk. Walking past someone smoking outdoors isn't going to negatively effect your health any more than a perfume or cologne might affect someone with an allergy.  As for ""vaping"" outdoors, there is absolutely no reason to criminalize the act. I hate the smell of tobacco smoke and the smell of flavored ""vape"" too, but I don't feel my discomfort from the smell is enough to warrant making it a criminal offense to offend my delicate nasal passage. In short, I just feel that laws that ban outdoor smoking of tobacco and ""vaping"" are disingenuous and go way too far. If people want to ban things that smell nasty, they are free to argue for that. But when they try to claim some health issue related to smoking outdoors, they lose my support."

Irregardless of whether you use electricity or not, pollution from coal burning power plants will affect your health. Why should secondhand smoke from these sources be allowed, even though they have well-proven health risks while second hand smoke from vaping does not? It's not a quantity issue, a single power plant can easily produce more smoke than thousands of people simultaneously smoking e-cigs, and the power plant will stay on nearly 24-7 too. If you think it is a risk-reward scenario, please tell me a single risk someone else smoking an e-cig does for you. They're made with food-quality ingredients that are well regulated, and you can't possibly inhale enough tobacco to feel it unless they're blowing it right in your face for quite a while. The only harm comes from inhaling a hot gas, but by the time its secondhand smoke this doesn't matter anymore."

Head up past Alberta Falls and keep going up Glacier Gorge.  If you don't get there early enough to find a parking spot at the Glacier Gorge trailhead, you'll have to park at the Bear Lake trailhead.  That'll not be as much fun on the way back, because the hill that climbs from GGTH to BLTH is not much fun.  Still totally worth it.  Start at the Bear Lake trailhead and follow the Alberta Falls trail downhill for a little bit until you get to the Glacier Gorge trailhead (it'll be on the left) and keep going past that.  It'll add a little elevation gain to your roundtrip, plus another mile or so, but it's still really easily manageable."

It would be a talking point to this day on Fox news.  And are we really going to have a Bush Clinton 2016 election?  Doesn't this prove that fame and not policy drives politics?

It is going to cost between 1 and 2 billion dollars to get elected president.  Simply put, that is not in any way democracy.  Running for office is now an investment opportunity that pays off triple in dividends.  The US voting base is 6th grade reading level reality TV fans.  They are going to vote for the person they see on TV the most.

I think it's one of the most popular political views these days, but most people have this delusion that Libertarianism is about complete corporate control, or that a third party has no chance. So they polarize. I would say for most people who identify with the term, Libertarianism is more about personal freedoms and not having to be a tax slave to a government who can't even hold a competent budget meeting."

Libertarianism is more about personal freedoms and not having to be a tax slave to a government who can't even hold a competent budget meeting.

Government is so many different things, State Universities, National Laboratories, The Interstate Highway system, Fire Fighters, Forest Service, USGS, National Parks, Police, and on and on. In many cases I would argue that not only is it the best way accomplishing some of these things, but the only way.  Having said that, obviously there are problems with government. The biggest one IMO is corporate money, which is effectively making the government a puppet for large corporate interests.   My biggest problem with Libertarians is that - like Conservatives - they tend to see the world in binary terms. Things are black or white, good or bad, Conservative or Liberal.

I couldn't say I am going to build a pool so you have to pay me to build it.  I couldn't go into your financial records and decide that you owe me a certain percentage of your income.  So the government shouldn't be able to extort money in this way either.  If an idea is good and can gain support it should be allowed to thrive voluntarily.  That is the basis of Libertarianism.

Colorado,2yk2u3,thebabaghanoush,6,Tue Mar 10 18:41:25 2015 UTC,"“I would say we are very pleased with what’s been accomplished,” Wells said Wednesday, speaking at the 2015 Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference in San Francisco.   This is not 'taking back' what they said about Net Neutrality.  Comcast enjoys a lack of competition because of government regulations that do not require cable line owners to rent out the lines, unlike your phone line where the owner must rent it out to competing services. These regulations can, and should, be changed. Comcast also lobbies the government to give them more monopolistic power, and lobbied against Net Neutrality. Comcast is also consistently voted one of the Top 10 Worst Companies In America.  I can't see how giving Comcast more monopolistic autonomy and power would be good for anyone other than Comcast executives and shareholders."

Colorado,2yk2u3,thebabaghanoush,6,Tue Mar 10 19:11:37 2015 UTC,"Please provide some kind of unbiased source on how Net Neutrality gives Comcast more power to employ anti-competitive practices. I have sourced all claims made.  I hold a Computer Science degree and Business minor, have worked for a software startup, internet startup, and currently work for one of the largest cloud and large-scale systems manufacturers in the world and all of my research points to Net Neutrality being a good thing for every internet consumer."

Colorado,2yk2u3,thebabaghanoush,8,Tue Mar 10 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"I guess you didn't read the second page of your link.:   It’s pretty simple—the FCC needs to pull the Title II ripcord, and just declare broadband a utility, and assert its legal authority to manage it as such.   The author supports Net Neutrality, but also supports a 'pay-for-what-you-use' internet pricing model where high bandwidth users such as Netflix watchers and gamers pay more than someone just browsing news articles and sending emails.  The author also has a flawed view of how Netflix streams their content. Comcast is not the provider connecting to Netflix's servers in Amazon's datacenters. Rather, companies like Level3 and Akamai serve as the middleman to get content from the datacenter to the ISP. The ISP provides the ""last mile"" to your home. Net Neutrality ensures that Comcast cannot strike a deal with Netflix to deliver their service faster than Hulu, or take money from Level3 to deliver their customers' content faster than Akamai.   In fact, Level3 is another company that lobbied for Net Neutrality. At the end of the day we're left with the same list of ISPs who refuse to innovate or invest in the networks they've already built so they can extort more money out of content providers and consumers alike."

Colorado,2yk2u3,unoleian,6,Tue Mar 10 20:45:09 2015 UTC,"Well, it certainly gives his opinion regarding this issue quite a bit more authority than blanket stances against 'the government' and treating all instances of regulation as  four-letter word.   Regulation is quite a bit like oxygen. We suffocate and die as a result of our own actions without it. The right amount makes thriving possible.

While we're on the topic though; I do like that I can call anyone on any network with my phone and not just people on the same network, that my water and gas bills don't have absurd prices attached to them because they're sold by an unregulated monopolistic company, and that I can use however much electricity whenever I want without having to worry about a big manufacturing plant or datacenter in town striking a deal with the electrical company to use however much they need regardless of other consumers."

Colorado,2ylfxw,WardJ,5,Tue Mar 10 20:03:23 2015 UTC,"Absolutely worth it.  Park is not dog friendly.  The main road that is closed is Trial Ridge Rd.  You should go back after it opens as it is really a highlight.  If you want to do some actual hiking, I would probably suggest Bear Lake area and renting snow shoes.  If you just want to check it out, you can drive into the park at the north entry near the Fall River visitor's center.  Possibly check out Alluvial Fan (waterfall a short distance from the parking area), continue around to the junction with Trail Ridge Rd, head west and drive up as far as it is open to Many Parks Curve.  Head back down and turn up Bear Lake Rd.  Check out Moraine Park, there is a parking area and you can walk around a bit.  Have fun!  and go back in about 4 months when summer hits the high country."
Colorado,2ylfxw,TrustyOneHit,4,Tue Mar 10 22:15:52 2015 UTC,"Just fyi, you can check my facts but I'm pretty sure all National Parks do not allow dogs.  (specifically the parks - not forests and such)"
Colorado,2ylfxw,jafnharr,2,Wed Mar 11 02:54:57 2015 UTC,"That probably depends on the amount of wildlife in the national park. Yellowstone, RMNP, and Yosemite have lots of things that could kill your dog or be provoked by it, and they don't allow dogs for that reason. But in Valley Forge Park, for example, the biggest threat to your dog is probably a deer. Though the deer would probably be scared shitless of you and your dog, since you're not in a car."
Colorado,2ylfxw,jafnharr,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:59:15 2015 UTC,"The rule I thought I was remembering, and what McGruppIsADog knew better off the top of his head is a straight across the board National Park rule.  It is about the impact of the dogs as well as if they're going to attack animals.  If you've lived in any apartment complex or suburban area with dogs you'll see how there is a non-trivial amount of people that just let their dog shit anywhere.  Stuff like that would wreck the parks."
Colorado,2ylfxw,jafnharr,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:18:27 2015 UTC,"To be fair, all the other animals in the wild are leaving their shit everywhere too (not to say I don't practice NLT for my own). It goes back to mother nature one way or the other. But as a general rule at most national parks, dogs are a bad idea. RMNP does ban dogs altogether in the backcountry and on the trails though, and I'm sure other parks as well."
Colorado,2ylfxw,jafnharr,1 point,Sat Mar 14 12:25:33 2015 UTC,Yeah they do.  Check the link I posted.  I get what you're saying.  I do trust the guys in charge of keeping the parks closer to what they were before us and their decision that pet dog poop is probably more dangerous and has stuff that wild animals normally don't have in theirs.

I would recommend snowshoes though, as the ground is still covered in snow, but we went the other day and it was 48 degrees, I was in a t-shirt (and wearing Snowshoes).

Plus the lakes are frozen over, so you can walk across them.  If you hike up around Bear Lake, you really don't need snowshoes.  I've hiked up to Emerald Lake and The Loch without snowshoes, though I did have chains for my boots.    If you intend to do serious hiking, bring a hat/face mask because the wind gets pretty nasty up there.  Nothing like 40+mph subzero winds blowing in your face :).  Also bring spare water, later time I went, the tub that goes into my camelback froze complete solid, making the last 3 miles slightly more difficult.    There is a $20 fee to get into the park, and if you are frugal like I am, spending a short amount of time there will piss you off because of the price, so plan a whole day event - or better yet, buy an annual pass, which is what I did.  $80 for a whole year of national parks is a steal.   I plan on going back to RMNP next week to get one last bit of winter hiking in."

Colorado,2yh46u,raiderato,12,Mon Mar 9 21:52:02 2015 UTC,"You know, I think you're onto something there.  Whenever Klingenschmitt says something insane (which is often) we need to press the other Republicans in state offices if they share his opinion. We need to ask this as publicly and neutrally as possible.  Either they say ""Yes"" and can also be framed as crazy, or they'll say ""No"" and alienate Klingenschitt. After enough alienation the Colorado Republican party either disowns him or he leaves on his own accord to a fundie party.  Either way is most likely a win.  EDIT: I see I missed an M in his name...

Colorado,2yh46u,TheMrNick,1 point,Tue Mar 10 01:44:02 2015 UTC,"No, it's just a matter of spending time where people are receptive.  EDIT: a regardless of whether he ""BARELY won the primary"" - the fact and reality is that this seat will go GOP, and the GOP primary will back nutjobs.  You can't blame this guy on everyone except his district.  There are plenty of people there, the majority chose to elect a nutjob.  Additionally, GOP primaries all over the country have been pushing increasingly more ideological candidates ever since Reagan pulled the religious right into the GOP.   So, besides his little congregation within a single district the reality is that the GOP primaries are completely extreme in every district of Colorado."

Colorado,2yh46u,bucknuggets,4,Mon Mar 9 23:17:22 2015 UTC,"Fair point on the rural aspect, but it's still the extreme edge of town, both literally and ideologically.    If you split the city down Academy, it's fair to say you'd have one moderate, maybe even left leaning city and one very conservative city.  So much of the conservative influx is relatively recent, starting in the early 90s with the arrival of Ted haggard, Focus, New Life, etc.. Which coincided with the housing boom out east.    I only point these things out to show that the city is hard to categorize, even though so many people try to do so.  For instance, we even had a somewhat decent shot at electing liberal Skorman as mayor last cycle."
Colorado,2yh46u,kepleronlyknows,5,Mon Mar 9 23:26:02 2015 UTC,"I spent 20 years in Manitou and recently moved to Boulder.   Along the way I've gone from one of the more liberal people I knew in Manitou to one of the more conservative I know in Boulder.  If you split Colorado Springs that way, I don't think you'd end up with a left-leaning part.  Maybe a moderate-leaning part.    At this point there's been such a conservative majority for so many years that it's harmed the culture.   Even reasonable conversations about tax, mass transit, garbage collection, diversity, schools, sex education, etc are difficult to have - a large chunk of people will lose their composure, and the reasonable one's that are left have been conditioned."

I understand your sentiment, and I agree, it might not be left leaning, but I'm not totally convinced.  Skorman did pretty damn well, and Makepeace is doing okay.  If you cut out the conservative chunk of the city I think it'd be damn close.  At the very least it wouldn't be nearly as conservative as our reputation portrays."

Colorado,2yh6yb,vscoy00,9,Mon Mar 9 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard of widespread issues due to hydraulic fracturing. There have been numerous spills at the surface, but none at depth that I'm aware of. People like to use fracking because its a popular buzzword, but most of our issues come from general oil and gas industrial activity.   One of the problems for finding this information is that many people in the Denver-Julesberg basin using well water already have methane contamination. For instance, that flammable water scene from Gasland? The state had already come out and proved that the gas had not resulted from drilling activity (biogenic and thermogenic methane have different isotopic signatures). That water well also penetrated three different methane-rich coal formations, with no casing.  I believe our governor just began mandating water testing by the oil companies both pre and post drilling, so that should help get us better ideas of how much contamination is happening. I don't doubt that there is likely more contamination than we know about, hopefully this new water testing program will help us separate the signal from the noise.  As I stated before though, all the issues I'm aware of either happen at surface (careless righands) and due to leaky casing (which can contaminate aquifers but is not the same as fracking).   no extraction taxes etc.   I also wanted to add that I've worked Pennsylvania, and I just can't comprehend the attitude towards regulations there. Your DEP is hideously underfunded, and there are open, unplugged and abandoned boreholes from the 19th century spewing oil all over the state. Yet they resist extraction taxes..."

Im in philly going to Drexel, but at 30 years of age I am ready to find somewhere more permanent and always considered CO, but gotta get the goods on all the things important to me; healthy living environment.  Since Gov. Wolf beat out Corbett in the last election hopefully things will get better for PA, but I doubt it. Just look at our environmental policies throughout the entire country, its a mess.  Seems to be WA, OR, ME, VT, NY are the most environmentally sound at this point. I want clean water and clear air before I plant my seed somewhere, build a home, etc."
Colorado,2yh6yb,TywinsChamberpot,2,Tue Mar 10 15:43:58 2015 UTC,"I doubt any good will come from the oil companies doing their own water tests   The oil companies are required to hire a contractor to collect water samples which are then fed through an independent lab for testing. Its really not a bad thing. Or in any way comparable to funding global warming propaganda.  Though I do often wonder why environmental ""advocates"" are so quick to poke holes in well intentioned and effective regulatory reform.   Seems to be WA, OR, ME, VT, NY are the most environmentally sound at this point.

If your car is debagged, has a loud exhaust or otherwise looks 2fast/2furious you will get a ticket for every little thing you do wrong.   I have always had illegal tint on my windows and have never been ticketed in my 20 years of illegally tinted windows in Colorado. The trick is, other than my tint, my cars is pretty plain. And when you get pulled over always role down the back windows too so the officer can see the entire inside of your vehicle.   The law is mainly to protect law enforcement. Give the officer the visibility to feel he/she is safe and you probably won't get messed with unless you have a big mouth and don't know how to speak to authority."

Lots of good players there, but the community can be a bit toxic.  I wouldn't mess about too much with CSGO's new matchmaking system.  It's a good way to get some practice in, but there's a rampant cheating problem and the setup isn't the same as it is in the competitive scene.

I'm in no way a fan of the Commissioner, but he is absolutely not linking crime in NYC to legalization in CO.   “The seemingly innocent drug that’s been legalized around the country. In this city, people are killing each other over marijuana more so than anything that we had to deal with [in the] 80s and 90s with heroin and cocaine . . . In some instances, it’s a causal factor. But it’s an influence in almost everything that we do here.”   Isn't the easiest reading of that bolded part that marijuana is a causal factor, not legal weed in Colorado is a causal factor?    Watch the video for yourself, it's impossible to construe what he says as linking the crime in NYC to Colorado legalization.    http://7online.com/news/new-york-city-top-cop-blames-pot-for-17-percent-increase-in-shootings/541023/"

Colorado,2xwguy,cpmccarron,8,Wed Mar 4 16:41:51 2015 UTC,"Tax Increment Financing (TIF) is often abused, so I can see this possibly being a good thing.  In Fort Collins they gave a large equity group $53 million in TIF to redevelop the mall that will never get paid back.  It's basically a large kickback to these private interests.  They say it will make up the revenue in increased sales tax, but it's just cannibalizing other tax receipts from across the city.   TIF certainly has its place, but often I find that if a project isn't viable without millions of TIF funding, then it shouldn't be viable at all.  Developers love TIF because it lines their pockets with taxpayer money.  Rarely does it help the general public."
Colorado,2xwguy,RyanSmith,7,Wed Mar 4 19:27:54 2015 UTC,"Genuine question here, when you say ""never get paid back"" what do you mean specifically?

Colorado,2xwguy,SkiFreeOrDie,4,Wed Mar 4 19:32:08 2015 UTC,"I don't have the numbers available at the moment, but when it was all broken down by someone familiar with the whole thing, it was pretty unlikely that the bonds will get fully repaid through the increase in tax revenue (note, this is also revenue that should be paying for things like schools, but has been diverted to a private company).  All the projections that the city used to push the deal were wildly optimistic and didn't account for things like cannibalization of existing businesses.  The mall was supposed to bring in a bunch of new businesses, but so far it seems to be the same old, same old on top of other businesses that are just relocating from other Fort Collins locations.  The mall was a shitty deal for Fort Collins and Larimer County.  The city manager just wanted to get it redeveloped so badly that he gave away the kingdom to do it.  On the other had, Woodward is building at technology campus and got $23.5 million in TIF.  I actually think that was a really good use of TIF that will bring in high paying jobs, increased economic activity, and higher tax revenue.  As I said TIF certainly has its place, but is often abused to line the pockets of developers."

There are several projects I've seen in recent years that really shouldn't have received TIF funding and were pushed through by big developer / capital fund interests.  Old Town Square is largely created and funded through a special tax district and the Downtown Development Authority that were created by voters and businesses that actually have to pay into those districts.  I have no problem with that as a property owner in that district that actually has to pay those taxes."
Colorado,2xwguy,RyanSmith,2,Wed Mar 4 20:34:14 2015 UTC,"Old Town Square was financed with TIF. It was an Urban Renewal Authority that morphed into a DDA after the 25 year clock expired. The property owners pay a mil levy, which is capped at five, to support the administration of the district. The TIF is used to finance the long term improvements."
Colorado,2xwguy,scholl734,7,Wed Mar 4 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"The problem with stuff like this? We elect people with the expectation they will manage these things. If you don't like how they do it, then elect someone else, that's how it works.   But more and more we're starting to have the public vote on every little thing and not only does that cost extra money and time, but it's not how our government was designed to work. And let's face it, the general voting public are barely informed voters anyways."
Colorado,2xwguy,bahnzo,4,Wed Mar 4 17:34:56 2015 UTC,"We elect people with the expectation they will manage these things. If you don't like how they do it, then elect someone else, that's how it works.   That's how it should work.  In reality, serving as an elected official for most people is an enormous sacrifice with no upside.   Except for developers.   For developers it's an investment.    So, most of these positions are filled by people who poorly represent their community."
Colorado,2xwguy,bucknuggets,5,Wed Mar 4 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"Says in the article, ""By having every urban renewal decision go before voters, [opponents] argued, developers will eventually just skip over Littleton and go elsewhere with their projects so as not to get entangled in expensive elections.""  Why should Littleton voters be on the hook for these risky urban renewal bonds if council and developers can't make a compelling, and public, case for them?  I understand the counter-argument, which does little but state that voters are dumb (and may, or may not be, the correct viewpoint)."

Colorado,2xwguy,Venae,7,Wed Mar 4 16:38:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I find it disgusting that city councils and planning boards are so dominated by those with developer-interests.  They come up with plans to maximize the profitability of land and sugar-coat it as ""progressive"".   When really the only thing progressive about it is their marketing of old-school pro-growth, pro-business strategies.  The same thing is going on in Boulder right now:  the pro-growth, pro-business groups are pushing to increase the value of their real estate.  To make this more politically palatable they sell it as ""improving affordability"".   Except the land becomes more valuable, less affordable, and any affordable housing offered is a tiny fraction of what would be needed to really change the housing cost for most people."
Colorado,2xwguy,bucknuggets,3,Wed Mar 4 18:38:37 2015 UTC,"They why don't you run for City Council or apply for a position on your local planning board? You are just being an armchair politician? If its such a big issue, then run for office."
Colorado,2xwguy,scholl734,4,Wed Mar 4 19:47:56 2015 UTC,"That's a cheap justification of the pro-growth/fake-affordability position:  that nobody gets to criticize these policies unless they run for office?!?   You are just being an armchair politician?   It's called ""being a citizen"": you get informed about topics, discuss them with friends and neighbors, learn more, provide info, help others get to the polls, and you vote.  And sometimes you walk around with a ballot proposal, or to ask people to vote.   And sometimes you run for office yourself.  I've done every one of these things, including holding minor office.  And that's more than what's required to be concerned about policy, discuss it with others and vote on the topic."
Colorado,2xwguy,bucknuggets,0,Wed Mar 4 21:15:20 2015 UTC,"You can criticize all you want, I believe firmly that an informed electorate is critical for every community. I was just responding to your suggestion that the boards are dominated by the developer interests. If that is the case, the only way to change it is to run for office. And...I was not justifying anything related to Boulder. Boulder is a world onto itself and I have no idea how that City operates."

Colorado,2xsu48,RustyBoiler,3,Tue Mar 3 18:29:31 2015 UTC,"Under the rule, new wells will need technology that allows operators to shut them off remotely; existing and new tanks have to be anchored to the ground; and pits containing fluids used during the hydraulic fracturing process will not be allowed within the boundaries of floodplains.

Colorado,2xsu48,JingJang,3,Tue Mar 3 18:33:03 2015 UTC,"I agree, these seem like good rules.  It shouldn't be a problem for companies to self report. The definition of flood-zone is very clear (Its a 100 year flood-zone as defined by local, state, or a federal agency).  http://cogcc.state.co.us/RR_Docs_New/FloodPlain/FinalRule.pdf  This is already part of well site analysis and the COGCC will only have to do a very quick GIS assessment to identify all of the wells that fit the 100 year flood zone requirement and need to be retrofitted.  This isn't a regulation that can be skated past.     It's probably a good sign when the Western Resources Advocates spokesperson doesn't think the regulation goes far enough - and an industry spokesperson complains it goes too far...

More and more corporations get away with paying no taxes and even get big payouts from the government, or increasingly amnesty to keep money they make by off shoring jobs - with no penalty.   Adoption is a cash cow that supports a lot of right wing churches in the middle of nowhere. The people who make that money have no formal training, they need no degree, its a completely unregulated industry. So, they are extremely defensive of what they consider to be their income stream, selling babies. They fought affordable health care! Notice that Obamacare is not affordable, that is in in part their doing. (among many other factors, like bad trade policy too! Things most people would never think were doing this)  TISA is going to increase offshoring and outsourcing a LOT. It forces the privatization of services down to the municipal level and then forces the globalization of those jobs. So there will be lots more families struggling as those decent state and city jobs vanish, along with workers, in many cases longtime workers hopes of receiving pensions.

Colorado,2xorlc,raiderato,2,Tue Mar 3 17:19:21 2015 UTC,"I agreed with the points you're making, however I urge you to understand that the rate of marriage is directly proportionate the economic stability and jobs as we know them are vanishing, especially for those with only a high school or two or four year college education.  Statistically, it seems that unwed motherhood is already the norm in many countries, and its increasingly accepted. However, the US has in the last 30 years reversed its position in the pack, going from a place of opportunity to become one of the more economically stratified 'rich nations', which means that poor children are likely to remain poor their whole lives and rich people, even incompetent ones are more likely to remain rich too.   The US goes out of its way to be mean to single mothers. And their children. Why?  This is an important issue. Sure, we should focus on making contraception available and affordable but we shouldn't decide that when a young woman has a child thats she's necessarily being bad or should not get support. In terms of health, the late teen yeand a woman's 20s are the time of life when she has the highest chance of having a healthy child. Women who defer childbearing until they marry, often that is not until their late 30s, early 40s or later (until they have economic stability?) are taking a risk that they may no longer be fertile. Also, there are an awful lot of chemicals in the environment now and many of them are genotoxic. In fact the government is pushing to freeze new environmental and chemical regulations globally, and to bring the EU countries down to the lowest common denominator nations standards-  thats not good news considering the huge backlog of endocrine disrupting chemicals still unregulated, including many in common use. People often discuss the ""epidemic of obesity"" but nobody realizes, obesogenic EDCs are largely what is making people fat. Yes ""obesogens"" are making people fat.   So people having children earlier in life is good if all these chemicals are to increase unless we want children routinely to be left without parents by cancer, etc.   It may be a fact of life that lacking a really good education, increasingly she joins a very great many others in having next to no chance to get a job and thats perhaps never going to change unless she is able to take that free time she has and devote it to things like learning and having a smart child. (kids who grow up with a mothers attention and care statistically have IQs as much as 10 points or more higher than those who do not)  . Suppose we live in a world where almost nobody has a job in 20 years. Sure, she has no income now, but she may in the future, given a chance. Global norms are changing. Some countries, like Sweden, most children are born outside of marriages and do fine. Does that mean we should stop reproducing, or that we should stop educating people to reach for the stars? under our current system it does, but - quite bluntly, our current system is wrong.

The US is the global mecca for rich couples wanting to adopt a healthy Caucasian child who looks like them. They are in high demand to the point where these couples from all around the world- wealthy couples engage in bidding wars over children. Couples come from everywhere else to adopt in the US because this is the only country that treats young women so badly that they cannot keep their children!  If something were to change so that women could keep their children, or if a woman is prevented from bringing a pregnancy to term by availability of contraception or affordable abortions, they consider that to be a threat.

Colorado,2xnhtr,iHaveWolfSkinSocks,28,Mon Mar 2 08:46:06 2015 UTC,Any tenant that wanted to was smoking weed in your units long before it became legal.  This law won't change much in that regard.
Colorado,2xnhtr,biorad17,28,Mon Mar 2 15:52:38 2015 UTC,"Not really. No smoking means no smoking.  Just be sure to reiterate ""no smoking of any kind in the house"".  If it is legalized, then they are allowed to smoke cigarettes or marijuana outside.  If neighbors complain, then they have to take it up with the police.    You would be surprised how many tenants are responsible and marijuana users though."
Colorado,2xnhtr,Jmersh,3,Mon Mar 2 12:38:35 2015 UTC,"That would be the issue, there's nothing to take up with the police. It's legal, and you can't (that I know of) outright ban smoking MJ like cigarettes due to its ""medicinal purposes"".  While I personally don't have a problem with people smoking outside there are those who are strongly against pot use. They may not want to tolerate the smell while they're out grilling on their porch, or their kids playing in the yard. My concern would be losing good tenants having to cater to people that want to smoke. Not that one couldn't have a building full of responsible, pot smoking, friendly tenants.  I prefer to provide comfortable housing to all tenants that rent from me and I'm trying to figure out what is acceptable to ask of tenants who smoke to ensure everyone is happy."
Colorado,2xnhtr,AlfLives,3,Mon Mar 2 15:42:15 2015 UTC,"You're probably right that you'd have trouble enforcing it because of medical patients. However, you can probably enact a smoking fee if it's in the lease. I've seen this on many properties I've rented over the years. Find out how much it will cost to have the unit deodorized, add on 30%, and put it in the contract that if they are caught smoking inside or if the unit has a lingering odor upon their departure, the fee will be enacted and taken out of their deposit. This way you're not telling them that they can't smoke, you're just making it their decision if they want to do it. Just don't be a dick about it and try to hide the fee in the contract; be upfront about it and let the renter know that you're serious about the fee.  With that said, pot smoke isn't nearly as offensive as cigarette smoke. The odor isn't as strong, it's not as rank, and it doesn't linger forever. I smoke several times a week in my garage (I own the home) and there is no odor at all a day or two after smoking. I'm not trying to say it's no big deal so get over it; just saying it's much less of a problem for you to deal with than tobacco smoke, so I wouldn't worry much about it."

In Colorado it's legal for a landlord to bar marijuana consumption inside/outside the home under all circumstances, it's also legal for an HOA to ban any detectable amount of marijuana regardless if this is recreational or medical marijuana.  Because marijuana is federally illegal things like the American Disabilities Act or Fair Housing Act don't apply.  However, Alaska may have protected medical use more idk."
Colorado,2xnhtr,htebazil,3,Mon Mar 2 16:14:58 2015 UTC,"Listen to her; she knows things.   I live in an apartment complex that outright bans all smoking of any kind inside or outside the unit. It is in my lease. Obviously, plenty of people smoke cigarettes and/or pot outside on their balconies or while walking a dog in the complex. It only becomes an issue when a neighbor complains. This has happened and we all get a notice reminding us that smoking is a violation of the lease and could be grounds for eviction.    TL;DR: Check the local law. Denver allows owners to ban smoking of any substance, regardless of whether it is prescribed for medical purposes.  edit: words"

Counties/cities have slightly differing views on this, some have defined this to mean marijuana consumption may occur only areas that can't be seen from the street but others have expressly defined things so that someone can smoke marijuana on any part of private, residential property provided they have the owner's permission.  But I am unaware of any area that outright bans outdoor marijuana consumption on all parts of private, residential space."

Colorado,2xnhtr,BB_Rodriguez,2,Mon Mar 2 15:59:02 2015 UTC,"The difference with cigarette smoke is that it sours, the chemicals in the smoke change into other more toxic chemicals over time. Since Cannabis doesn't have all the additives that tobacco has, this doesn't happen."

Colorado,2xnhtr,CptnHeinry,2,Mon Mar 2 17:02:50 2015 UTC,"Heavy use could leave some odor and there's a slight fire risk. When you're a landlord, you have to be concerned about the shit that happens 1% of the time because the damage done could ruin you. So he puts it in the contract that smoking is not allowed and then the tenant can choose to test their luck with smoking pot inside. Chances are the tenant will get away with it because the odor isn't bad. But the landlord still has to put it in the contract so he has recourse if the tenant does damage.  TLDR; he's not being uncool, it's just risk management of his assets."

It's a circular argument, ""The people who are required to have clean criminal and mental health records and have the ability to obtain a CCW license are less likely to have a criminal record and poor mental health then the average citizen""...Duh. So that's why you'd have to statisically adjust the data for CCW when comparing to the general public for things like education, income level, etc.  Again I believe that CCW holders are more responsible, but that's because we only give responsible citizens CCW licenses. As for the argument about them being worse than cops by /u/SmartToaster well...  1) Cops jobs are to seek out and deal with dangerous situations, as such they have a lot more opportunity to fuck it up/shoot some one innocent than a CCW holder, so that's not really a fair comparison (unless you have peer-reviewed statiscally adjusted data that shows cops still come out looking bad when you control for the right things, which I'd love to see).  2) If it is true, that seems to me more an argument for more selective hiring and training of police, then it is an argument for letting CCW holders start taking on some of the roles of the police. You know, or hire those good CCW holders as cops and let them teach the others how to do their jobs better, with all the oversight and answerability that (should) come with a police officer.  3) That being said I think that policing in america is broken and needs to be done, and I don't particularly trust the cops to begin with, so maybe we're just all fucked."

Explain to me how, as /u/RustBoiler has pointed out, removing a law that prevents non-trained non-professionals from carrying guns onto school campus, the exact kind of person Holmes was, is going to make schools safer?  If this law was about introducing, say, more armed security guards who receive adequate training, or adding a police presence to schools, then fine. However that's not what's being proposed. By the way I don't care that you've safely owned and used guns your whole life, so have I and I still don't believe I should be allowed to carry one into a school full of children.  Allowing people who are not heavily trained security professionals to carry lethal weapons in buildings full of children with the specific intent that said untrained amateur is to utilize that weapon in an active shooter situation is beyond moronic. It's criminally insane.  What the hell is wrong with you second amendment loonies?

This world of chaos that you paint to those of a differing view point is a distorted view of gun owners.  When we have laws in place as they currently exist, then we are in denial of the America that we actually live in.  Guns are everywhere and there's nothing we can do to truly prevent a psychopath from getting a hold of one, and there is absolutely nothing to stop them from reaching our kids.

What the hell are you smoking because it's gotta be much stronger than weed.  Just because you believe that the cops near you are bad shots doesn't mean shit. Show me some evidence and data that backs up your argument that civilians who do not go through mandated training are better at handling weapons then professionals who have to get certified on a regular basis.  This is my main problem with you gun wingnuts, your aruments tend to revolve heavily around illogical arguments, anecdotal stories/evidence, and a willingness to make statements and policies without (or directly contradicting) established bodies of data and evidence.  What could possibly be the harm in requiring intensive training and certification before certifying someone to carry firearms, with the intent to use them in an active shooter crisis, in a building full of children?"

The answer to safer environments is not the addition of more weaponry - as much as the pro-gun audience desires it to be.  Let's train our educators to educate and leave the fear-mongering to the nightly news.    And here's a basic question, if teachers are allowed to carry firearms to classes AND there is a dramatic increase in gun violence, does that argue for more or fewer guns in our school systems?"
Colorado,2xcw08,tmtreat,-3,Sat Feb 28 00:25:05 2015 UTC,"But wait, what if no teachers feel a need to bring a gun?  Someone, quick tell the GOP that there might not be enough gun sales, er guns at the schools.   After some brain-storming, we've got a solution:    The GOP could make it illegal to teach history unless you can hit a child-sized target 7 times out of 10 from 100 yards  They could finance the construction of robots that automatically shoot at any target that makes a loud noise  Firing accuracy should definitely be made part of every teacher's performance evaluation.  In order to ensure teachers aren't penalized for carrying guns, we should absolutely loosen the liabilities they might face for leaving a loaded gun unattended, accidently firing a gun in school, or standing their ground against disrespect.  Since a gun in a pocket is useless in a surprise situation, guns should be required to be in hand, with safety off at all times.   Attachments will be made available to teachers to help them eat and use the toilet with the gun in their hand."
Colorado,2xcw08,SmartToaster,13,Fri Feb 27 22:49:54 2015 UTC,"This is seriously stupid. This is literally the opposite of anti-gun people who want to ban all guns; instead, we want guns everywhere. And it's even based on the same logic that a Sandy Hook-style shootout could go down any minute, even though both sides know mass shootings make up a tiny percentage of total gun crimes; it's a pretty low chance that something like that would happen.  Stop talking about guns. Things are fine the way they are. Guns are already everywhere; we have gun rights in CO. Move on. Do some work. Build more damn trains, do something."
Colorado,2xcw08,Sooperburd,8,Fri Feb 27 23:24:42 2015 UTC,"An often overlooked dynamic is the deterrent.  Teachers preparing for and believing that they can stop a Sandy Hook style shooting is a tad irrational.  The chances of it happening are absolutely miniscule.  So rational carriers stay proficient with their carry gun, make sure nobody ever knows they carry it, and will most likely never need to use it.  However, what you might be missing is the fact that a possible shooter can be deterred from attempting the shooting if he knows there could be people firing back.  Mass shootings overwhelmingly take place in gun free zones, where the shooters can be certain of no resistance.  Place a few gun carrying, conscientious teachers in the schools, and you remove this warm fuzzy feeling from the would-be mass shooters.  So this way the shooting never needs to be stopped; the shooter decided it wasn't a good idea in the first place.  Edit: To your last point that ""we have gun rights in CO"":  Our gun rights were seriously and irrationally infringed upon with the recent laws that were passed.  Imagine if several laws were passed that irrationally limited vaping on the open street.  You'd be pretty pissed about it, right?  You'd work your ass off to get the laws repealed, right?  Edit 2: source: 92% of mass shootings between 2009 and 2014 were in gun free zones."

Most schools already have police personnel stationed within them, why should we let untrained, amateur hobbyists also carry?  For the record, I grew up with and currently own multiple guns for sport, and still think this is an irrational knee jerk response by the gun nut lobby."

Waitstaff and patrons are allowed to be armed because restaurants largely aren't in gun free zones.  The worst mass shootings in restaurants happened well before concealed carry became popular (Brown's Chicken was the latest in 1993, Luby's was in 1991, San Ysidro McDonald's was in 1984).  Those shootings are the only restaurant shootings that rival Columbine, Sandy Hook, Aurora, and Fort Hood.  Now that restaurants aren't gun free zones, the worst shootings no longer happen at restaurants.  Go ahead and make all restaurants gun free zones and I'll be you dollars to doughnuts that mass shootings will become more common there.  Finally, we're not talking about requiring waitstaff to be armed, or requiring teachers to be armed.  We're talking about allowing teachers to be armed if they would like to do so.  I'm not in favor of requiring anyone to carry a gun."

The grabbers really do want to ban all guns, and this is how they accomplish it: little by little.  Not to nitpick, but guns fed from ammo cans are almost exclusively fully automatic, and that gear is heavily legislated already.  I would just rather have zero restrictions on magazine capacity.  The laws are troublesome to enforce (i.e. easy to circumvent), make criminals out of law abiding citizens, and do nothing to limit criminals intent on harming others."

Seems like there's already a large and vocal group that doesn't agree with the legislation here. I doubt it will keep getting worse.

No. That has nothing to do with it. I'm not accusing the NRA of being a bunch of lousy 2nd Amendment lovers; I'm accusing them of being a slick corporate lobbying power that helps craft legislation favorable to the firearms industry, as well as being a PR firm in favor of the industry.   The NRA isn't as powerful as people make it out to be.   I'm pretty sure it's one of the most influential lobbying presences in Congress."
Colorado,2xcw08,jadraxx,4,Sat Feb 28 00:00:07 2015 UTC,"This is something I've had floating around my head for some time now and I'd like to hear what other Coloradans have to say about it.  What if, instead of any CC permit holder being able to carry on campuses, select teachers (meeting some agreeable criteria) were specifically trained on carrying a concealed weapon in a school. These teachers' identity would not be common knowledge, but they would be extensively trained (maybe during a summer course with professional folks?) and background-checked.  Basically how Air Marshals could be anybody on a plane. Instead of just getting the easy-to-get Concealed Carry permit, you have to demonstrate a mastery of your weapon and crisis management skills.  Does that seem reasonable (specifically interested in folks for extensive gun control) or am I just sounding like a crazy person?"
Colorado,2xcw08,satanisativa,1 point,Sat Feb 28 03:14:54 2015 UTC,"Don't teachers have enough responsibility?  Education is literally the lowest paying masters degree you can get in the US (outside of social work) and now the wing nuts want to make them armed guards, along with coach, substitute parent, warden, advocate, and ... Teacher.    Why not let trained security staff handle the risks and responsibility of guarding a school and just focus the teachers on teaching?"
Colorado,2xcw08,RustyBoiler,2,Sat Feb 28 05:30:21 2015 UTC,"That's fair. To present an argument, the ""position"" in my mind would be completely voluntary with the option to back out of it at any time. It would also be much more of a preventative measure; teachers, from what I've seen, are already very cognizant of their surroundings and students. This could just be a way to discourage somebody from attempting a shoot-up in the first place.  During school shootings, teachers also already tend to take the risks and responsibilities into their own hands, anyway."
Colorado,2xcw08,chilaxinman,3,Sun Mar 1 19:12:32 2015 UTC,"I've also had a discussion about this with people on reddit and someone brought up a good point. How would Colorado pay or get the funding for the highly trained security guards or what have you? I see nothing wrong with your idea. I also don't think the teachers would look at it as another ""responsibility"". The ones who would choose to do it would feel betting knowing they have self protection and the protection for the school. The only people who I see having an issue with this are the people who are against guns in general."
Colorado,2xcw08,RustyBoiler,2,Sun Mar 1 19:44:12 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your feedback! I like the idea, too, although this post has given me some stuff to think about. Logistical implementation could be an issue as well as standardization. I'm scheduled to get my teaching licence in the next couple of years, so maybe once I work from the inside I'll be able to propose a more thorough plan."
Colorado,2xcw08,chilaxinman,1 point,Sun Mar 1 20:06:02 2015 UTC,"As evidenced by their continued reference to anyone as ""crazy"" or ""nuts"" who even entertains the remote possibility that armed and trained faculty could help if implemented properly.  It's just about towing the anti-gun line and standard repeating the same hoplophobia: MOAR GUNZ!? NEVAR teh answer! I dnt trust peeps with gunz they kill people!

Colorado,2xcw08,chilaxinman,1 point,Fri Feb 27 21:13:15 2015 UTC,"While I disagree with most attempts to regulate guns, there are also plenty of legitimate ""gun nuts"" I think. A lot of them tend to be inexperienced gun owners in my experience. Basically the opposite of what you described. Any discussion about guns immediately becomes a personal attack on their rights. There are few gun regulations I'm willing to embrace, but to not even be willing to have the discussion? It's a failure on both sides of the issue to even talk about it openly.  The moderate majority (on both sides of the issue) tend to get drowned out by the crazies."
Colorado,2xcw08,skippythemoonrock,1 point,Fri Feb 27 21:37:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly the way I look at it is if someone is going to go crazy and shoot up a school it doesn't matter what the laws are they are going to do it anyways. Also, Columbine wasn't just a shooting. They had fucking pipe bombs. It was a god damn all out assault. I agree with Nevill and believe if one of the teachers had a gun the massacre wouldn't of been nearly as severe. With the statistics being in favor of CCW permit holders as mentioned elsewhere in this thread I just feel like by having the no gun laws they aren't doing anyone any good anymore. 20-30 years ago yea they would make sense. Times change. I see the concerns of the other side. But for me funding and personally knowing CCW permit holders being the absolute safest people around guns especially with kids around vs my not nearly as safe friends who have a piece not registered trumps their concerns and would rather volunteered CCW holding teachers to be allowed to carry to school.  Edit: Grammar. Words are hard."

The worst part about this is that this really seems to be (to me at least)  a manufactured controversy and crisis, that doesn't have a grounding in reality.  There hasn't been any school shooting issue or crisis in Colorado for nearly 20 years.    But in an election year where there are hot-button gun issues likely on the ballot (e.g.: the well-intentioned but ill-conceived large magazine ban) putting guns in schools is suddenly a ""crisis"" that needs action.  As a river of gun industry money flows into state politician's hands this year, they're literally falling all over each other to find ways to incorporate even more guns into the partisan platforms."

They're asking us to do their legwork. Not saying you are one of those, but it does increase the negativity to out of state posters.  Third, CO has been a very welcoming environment in the past. Now that's changing a bit due to the number of Californians and Texans coming to CO. And yes, there are plenty of people coming from other states. You guys just tend to stick out.   Fourth, there's been many ad hoc comments about the Californian wanting her coffee latte a certain temperature, and causing a fit when it isn't perfect.

Colorado,2xf57n,bafflez,0,Sat Feb 28 02:26:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everyone outside of Texas dislikes stereotypical Texans. It's not unique to Colorado.  It's mostly due to the unabashed elitism that a lot of Texans are so proud to display and their insistence in telling you about how their state is superior to everywhere else in the world combined.  The occasional secession movements certainly don't help its image, either.   If you merged Lance Armstrong, Rick Perry, George W into one person, and then subtracted the positive achievements those people have had, that's about what most people outside of Texas think of the average Texan. Stupid, dishonest, arrogant, self-serving, and ignorant.  That said, most people (in Colorado and elsewhere) love being pleasantly surprised, and will be happy to accept you as a friend/coworker/whatever if you're a decent guy/gal.   Don't be a stereotypical Texan- but just to be safe, get a Colorado driver's license and plates ASAP."
Colorado,2xf57n,RandyIsHungry,1 point,Sat Feb 28 05:28:21 2015 UTC,"That just seems really bizarre to me. I mean there's definitely a type of Texan that fits the ""ignorant redneck Republican"" stereotype but there are also tons of just normal people here, like everywhere else I suppose. Seems just as ignorant and bigoted to judge the population of a state as big as Texas based on a few idiots. Of course I guess nobody notices the normal Texans that don't make a big deal about where they're from."

Like the article says he admits the initial investigation was mishandled.   He didn't come on board until a few months after the case began. He also makes its pretty clear that he thinks someone in her family did it based on the time line of events, the ransom note, and some evidence indicating she was sexually molested a few weeks or so prior to her murder. He never came right out and said it, but he did say something along the lines of: ""the evidence would suggest someone in her family did it."""

A real cop can catch you speeding AND give you a ticket for not signaling or being lazy and driving with your high beams on becuase your low beam bulb burnt out. I want to see more people punished for their horrendous driving.
Colorado,2x7a3m,choppysmash,3,Thu Feb 26 15:53:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe the cops could start using their turn signals and shit first. Set an example, and such."

Colorado,2x9hai,dobodlee,5,Thu Feb 26 21:23:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'll find anyone who doesn't agree we should examine the details of the regulation... but this is exactly what the FCC was created to do! I also think it should be re-iterated that this ruling is not a law, but a regulation exactly like we have on other basic services like gas & electricity.  Net Neutrality isn't putting the internet in the hands of the government or allowing the feds to dictate how much you pay for internet access. It simply classifies the internet in such a way that all data, regardless or origin, must be treated equally. Net Neutrality isn't about control, it's a freedom that I think most people believe is absolutely essential to protect in this day in-age.   Probably won't matter much though, since all the massive ISP's (Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, TimeWarner) have already sworn to spend millions suing in an attempt to get Congress to repeal the decision. It's going to be very hard for the FCC to fight corporations with so much money & influence... so I don't think reddit should be quite so optimistic that the ruling will stick."
Colorado,2x9hai,Huckleberry-Hiker,5,Fri Feb 27 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"It's not a law. The law is that the FCC has the ""authority to regulate interstate communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. "" (wikipedia). A regulation enacted by an agency is not a law. In another example the FDA recently created regulations for how all medical devices will have to be labeled with unique identification. This regulation did not go through congress because the FDA already has the legal authority to make such regulations. Are you upset you didn't get to vote on that either? If congress wants they can try to pass a new law saying that the FCC does not have the authority to regulate the internet as they have just done, and best of luck to them. You and I still won't have a vote on it though.  I think this issue of ""300+"" pages is mostly scaremongering. The actual regulations won't be nearly that long. Most of it will be history and comments.   ""In fact, it could take weeks before the final rules are published, the official said. That’s because the two Republican commissioners, Ajit Pai and Mike O’Rielly—who oppose net neutrality of any sort—have refused to submit basic edits on the order. The FCC will not release the text of the order until edits from the offices of all five commissioners are incorporated, including dissenting opinions. This could take a few weeks, depending how long the GOP commissioners refuse to provide edits on the new rules."" source  Don't buy into the FUD."

Steel and concrete don't hold up any better at that depth than frigging rice paper. In 1966, the 12,000' Rocky Mountain Arsenal injections were halted by the US Army because of earthquakes in Denver. The USGS just announced a direct correlation between earthquakes and wastewater injection in Oklahoma where nobody has any friggin basements and they build their houses on skids. People here have basement foundations, which make injection quakes a legitimate concern to homeowners, and renters are being driven out by all the johnnies-come-lately.

Not to mention there's not much proof that fracking is detrimental.   is rightfully held in check by meaningful legislation when you damage your neighbor's peaceful, unspoiled enjoyment of their own property, aquifer, and earthquake-free existence.   Sidestepping the questionable veracity of your claim... The mineral rights holders' properties were likely well outside of a city, or well outside of development, when they were purchased. In many cases these new residents encroached on these people's property and then claim that it's too close to them for drilling... Again, this would be a VERY expensive project for a municipality. Not just in pure compensation, but also in legal fees."
Colorado,2x64zy,RustyBoiler,-2,Fri Feb 27 00:57:17 2015 UTC,a VERY expensive task   Not as expensive as replacing a critical contaminated aquifer.

But they never thought they'd have neighbors, and believed that everything around them would be exactly the same forever.  Therefore the government owes them a handout.  By your reasoning, after classifying asbestos as a hazard, the government should have paid reparations to asbestos mining companies.     It's absurd."
Colorado,2x64zy,raiderato,2,Fri Feb 27 01:24:33 2015 UTC,"By your reasoning, after classifying asbestos as a hazard, the government should have paid reparations to asbestos mining companies.   If fracking caused irreparable harm to communities, and in a way that couldn't be limited by safety measures, then they'd be similar.  However, fracking doesn't cause harm and the harm it could cause can be mitigated with pretty reasonable safety measures.  You have to weigh the benefits against the negatives. The negatives are small, and able to be made even smaller. The benefits to this state, and municipalities are massive."
Colorado,2x64zy,RustyBoiler,-5,Fri Feb 27 04:16:16 2015 UTC,fracking doesn't cause harm   Except for the earthquakes.  And contaminated water supplies.
Colorado,2x64zy,whobang3r,3,Fri Feb 27 04:31:07 2015 UTC,So what you are against is actually wastewater injection wells and not fracs?

Colorado,2x64zy,RustyBoiler,2,Fri Feb 27 04:33:42 2015 UTC,"I think there's good reason to believe fracking, regulated and standardized, can be a fairly clean and safe way of extracting energy. There's a lot of innovation with using recycled water and state-of-the-art water purifying technologies that companies are implementing.  I'm sad to see that local control wasn't agreed upon, but I think CO's going about fracking in generally the right way."
Colorado,2x64zy,TywinsChamberpot,0,Fri Feb 27 15:29:25 2015 UTC,"The problem is that all of these innovations are a lot more expensive than toxic wastewater injection wells.

Colorado,2wziew,timm0113,39,Tue Feb 24 14:39:20 2015 UTC,"This would have been true in the first 5 months last year. Not anymore. Most rec dispensaries have lowered their costs to 25 an 1/8th, which is right on line with what you'd pay on the black market typically.  So while it may not show up in statistics right now, the black market is very VERY much suffering I would think given the options the citizens have now.   Given that people are allowed to grow their own, suppressing the black market entirely is practically impossible, but I think it's a real possibility to get it to extremely low levels of abuse."

What she will never account for is the truth of legalization in Colorado.   The lifetime lost wages and income from being incarcerated or indicted for marijuana related charges. 10,000 fewer convicts per year in Colorado. 60 million dollars less in law enforcement costs, after other costs are incorporated. The US spends $10 billion on marijuana prohibition alone.   The average lifetime lost earnings statistics weigh in at about $180k per convicted person (15% less than non convicts). In Colorado alone, that could represent almost $2 billion per year in lost lifetime earnings potential (10,000 convicts times 180k=1.8 billion. with a ""B"").  This doesn't even scratch the surface of the real impacts to real lives- formation of families, home purchases, public assistance need, domestic violence, etc.  By my half-assed calculations, legalization nets over $100 million a year to the State, and $1.8 billion in increased income for the people of Colorado, each and every year.

I moved from Virginia where you can buy beer and wine in grocery stores but have to go to a state abc store for liquor. There was an extremely good beer and wine shop in blacksburg there that simply kept there selection different than the grocer next to it with only a little, if any, overlap. Chains focus on mass beers with maybe a few crafts (they move enough product that they dont have to have a great selection to draw in crowds) and this means the specialty stores can focus more on special beers. Some of the small alcohol stores with not as good selection might be driven out of business but specialty shops/larger stores should survive."

Colorado,2wlz59,DeviatedNorm,6,Sat Feb 21 01:30:37 2015 UTC,"There is a ton of demand out there for craft beers. That isn't changing anytime soon. If anything, it's increasing.  These big retailers will definitely pick up more and more craft brews. One or two of them might even make it a niche of theirs to stand out against other grocery stores. That could mean that little brewers could have a chance at being bought in bulk without needing to employ as many sales and marketing people to go around and visit liquor stores to try to get a bunch of different people to pick their stuff up. Theoretically this would allow them to lower prices and/or increase pay for employees more essential to the brewing process.  Some aspects of the change could potentially have negative effects on some craft brewers as your friend claims. I just wanted to point out an alternative take that seems just as plausible to me, though I'm not going to predict with any level of certainty that either will actually occur."

In IL we can buy anything in a grocery store, full strenght beer, wine, booze of any proof.  There is no shortage of liquor stores that support the craft beer movement along with the other beverages they sell. Just today I went to one of the better liquor stores in my area because I'm not going to find a couple bombers of barleywine at the grocery store or convenience store.  I did however pickup a 12er of a porter on my last grocery trip that when I move to CO will require me to make a second stop before heading home.    I can't speak to others states in great depth but I can say that I've traveled the country a decent bit and when I have been able to buy good full strength beer in a grocery store that there have not been any issues with the brewery scene or the options for locations to buy local craft beer.   Now places like Idaho who have state liquor stores for booze but they don't sell beer and your options for beer really come down to only grocery stores.  Here is a state that has issues when the best beer options would be the 1 Whole Foods or Cost Plus World Market in the entire state or brew your own."

Colorado,2wk8ne,RainbowBrittle,2,Fri Feb 20 17:05:41 2015 UTC,Because the only real way to enforce background checks for all is by creating a national registry of every gun owner.  Gun owners are not against background checks. You'll be very hard pressed to find one that is.  Why can't we make a website that allows anyone to enter a SSN and get a YES or NO answer? Make background checks more accessible?

But ""most"" gun owners aren't the problem. It's the frothing fringe minority who dominate the discussion. And I'd have absolutely no problem with registering guns. We register people's cars and their houses (property taxes, ownership paperwork, etc.) and somehow have managed to avoid the North Korean statism the right always promises will follow.

Colorado,2wk8ne,TheMrNick,2,Fri Feb 20 17:54:09 2015 UTC,"Here, have your upvote back (even though I disagree with your first sentence, and the implication that sometime in the future, all gun owners will be rounded up/forcibly disarmed). If the U.S. military somehow turns all its weaponry on us citizens, I don't think hunting rifles and pistols are going to do us that much good.  But I've never purchased a gun, so I don't know how it works right now--I thought you could go to a gun shop and pay them to perform the check; isn't that the compromise? Is that somehow leading to a national registry of gun owners?  I certainly don't want to hand my SSN over to some random dude on Craigslist--or even a neighbor, for that matter."
Colorado,2wk8ne,RainbowBrittle,1 point,Fri Feb 20 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"Right now if you purchase a gun through any channel OTHER than a private sale there is a background check.  The problem is the private sales (aka ""gun show loophole"" which doesn't actually involve gun shows at all). The government has no way to know if two people exchange something unless it kept strict track of the location of every gun, and it's owner via a national registry.  Unfortunately this opens a massive can of worms as far as governmental abuse goes. Imagine if a racist cop had a list of every black person who owned a gun?  And for the record the argument that hunting rifles can't stand up to the US Military is disingenuous. First, in this hypothetical situation of civil war, you'd find that a large part of the military would have issues with shooting their own people. Secondly, history has shown that a massive population of people with inadequate firearms can totally overpower a smaller, but better armed adversary."
Colorado,2wk8ne,TheMrNick,1 point,Fri Feb 20 17:47:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think you answered my question about the background check at gun stores being an acceptable compromise. If a gun that you sold without a background check gets used in a crime and it gets traced back to you, I think you deserve to be in trouble. A lot of laws work that way--if you don't get caught, you're fine, but if something bad happens and gets traced to you, that's when the shit hits the fan. No national registry required.  But, reading yet another story about a pregnant woman getting killed by a man who didn't check to make sure his gun was unloaded before practicing tricks with his finger on the trigger--I don't understand why there is no mandatory training before being allowed to own a gun.   Black people used to be afraid that having to register cars in order to drive them legally would lead to black people not being able to drive. Despite horribly violent racism, Jim Crow, etc., somehow the restriction on cars didn't happen. If cops had a list of every black person who owned a gun, maybe that would show them which houses to avoid no-knock raiding? Seriously, I'm black and this has never been a concern of mine. We have enough to worry about when we're unarmed or carrying toy guns...   I think that promoting the idea of a hypothetical yet apparently inevitable future 2nd Civil War is disingenuous. It invites fear about what might happen years from now (possibly not even in our lifetimes), while gun violence and gun accidents are REAL and happening NOW. It's yet another front for anti-science people: we can't even STUDY how gun ownership affects society, because of the power of the NRA.    Honestly, from what I've read about the people who are preparing for a civil war against the U.S. government, I don't think our views would mesh, if you know what I mean. :/"
Colorado,2wk8ne,RainbowBrittle,1 point,Sun Feb 22 05:47:19 2015 UTC,"I think that most gun owners don't mind the background checks, it is a small necessary step to keep some people who should not own guns (those that have committed a felony, though that is it's own can of worms). What terrifies most of us, myself included is that the government has already shown us multiple times that it is corrupt and cannot be trusted with the information that they DO get. Why would we want to give them any more info to abuse?   While many people love to shout ""THEY AREN'T COMING FOR YOU GUNS!!"" at us, the fact of the matter is that yes, some of them are! There are plenty of politicians who are against guns and gun ownership and know NOTHING about either. A great example of this is Diana DeGette who has no idea how magazines operate, yet wants to limit/ban them.

There was no way my parents & grandparents could have won an armed battle; it had to be done through legislation and enforced by the government. Good intentions did nothing without government involvement.  This country has many different opinions about gun ownership, informed and uninformed, same as with politicians who want to control access to birth control and abortion, who have no idea how women's bodies work. Right now, the tables are tilted almost entirely in favor of gun owners, with no assurance that those of you who own lethal weapons have even basic training of how to use them.   I'm actually afraid for some of my in-laws, who are carrying around guns that they never practice with. I think they are just as likely to hurt themselves if they needed to draw in an emergency situation.  I would like to see a license for people who want to be able to handle guns legally, like we have for cars? Unlike cars, no requirement to register every gun, but a requirement to pass a written test on gun safety/use/etc. Yes, the government would have a list of everyone who is able to legally operate a gun, but just as with cars, you don't have to say whether or not you own a gun in order to get the license."

I completely agree, that is why in most states you have to pass a concealed carry class in order to carry. Now this does not address open carry, but honestly I think that open carrying is just asking for trouble. If someone is going to carry a gun, open or concealed, they need to be proficient with their firearm, but more importantly know when and when not to use that firearm.   I would like to see a license for people who want to be able to handle guns legally, like we have for cars? Unlike cars, no requirement to register every gun, but a requirement to pass a written test on gun safety/use/etc. Yes, the government would have a list of everyone who is able to legally operate a gun, but just as with cars, you don't have to say whether or not you own a gun in order to get the license.   This already exists in some states where you need a permit to even a buy a gun. And as mentioned above in order to concealed carry in most states you have to take a concealed carry course. As for the government having a list you are forgetting something. Not many people, if any, would get the license to own a gun and then not get a gun. So even though the gun itself would not be registered, the government would still know that you can have one and likely do. That is information that they do not need."

Considering that there is a near certainty that both public and private entities with access to consumer purchase and mobile data can easily recreate both gun and ammo purchase timelines, patterns of traffic and association consistent with gun ownership... why haven't the vampire cops acted on this already?  Since we're literally talking about allowing the database used by gun shop owners and gun show vendors to be accessed by a few more people, why would that suddenly trigger the societal collapse that you're currently afraid of?   And for the record the argument that hunting rifles can't stand up to the US Military is disingenuous...   That's the one.  The ridiculous Red Dawn style apocalypse fantasy.  Bringing it up is pretty much how you can tell the sane responsible gun owners from the lunatic fringe crackpots."
Colorado,2wk8ne,RustyBoiler,2,Fri Feb 20 18:04:29 2015 UTC,Your last point.   Thats the ticket.  Why is this idea not more popular of an idea?
Colorado,2wk8ne,peanutbuttergoodness,2,Sat Feb 21 03:04:49 2015 UTC,"Because the only real way to enforce background checks for all is by creating a national registry of every gun owner.   Like we do for home owners.  And car owners.   I'm still not following why your unexplained fears about having an additional line entry in a database are not crazy.     Visa knows you bought a gun, and likely how much ammo you have.   American Express knows it too.  So does every other merchandiser that ever buys access to that database.    Your cell phone company lets the NSA and FBI know how often you've driven to the gun shop, and range to practice.  Pretending that the government doesn't already have a very clear picture of who owns how many guns and how much ammo utterly ignores the last 30 years of technology and consumer marketing practices.    Is this about some fantasy you harbor about fighting American democracy and the U.S. armed forces?"
Colorado,2wk8ne,RustyBoiler,2,Fri Feb 20 17:41:01 2015 UTC,"Driving and home ownership are not rights guaranteed in the Constitution. And since we're ""just pretending"" that the government isnt a de facto totalitarian surveillance state why would we voluntarily give them more legitimate power? The fear of confiscation is a very real one. The fear of an armed police and military without civilian counter is a very real one. How many of the mass shootings are perpetrated by firearms legally purchased with background checks ? How would closing this ""loophole"" effect the problem other than making people feel better? How many of these private sales are responsible for shooting deaths? Those are the questions that need to be answered before we just go throwing more regulations at a perceived problem. You have to come up with some solid reasoning before you start limiting Constitutional rights; ""we're scared"" isnt good enough."
Colorado,2wk8ne,sun827,-2,Sat Feb 21 13:53:29 2015 UTC,"I'll put it simply, so that you stand a chance at understanding.   Every right enumerated in the constitution comes with responsibilities and reasonable limits. These are expressed as rules and laws, of the sort necessary to sustain a functional society.   For some reason, there are a handful of people out there, like yourself that believe that the second amendment should be the only amendment that carries no responsibilities, limits or regulations, despite the obvious destabilizing effects that has on our society."
Colorado,2wk8ne,RustyBoiler,4,Sat Feb 21 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"You obviously have a very simple axe to grind so allow me to be brief since I wont be changing any minds here. I made no argument that there should be no limits. I made a very reasoned response to your emotional outburst and yet you still speak from a position of condescension without addressing how or why this regulation would be needed. Im not some red-state line-ticket voter. There are already plenty of limits and restrictions on firearms and firearm ownership. The national registry would not curb our societies gun violence and would likely create larger problems down the road. Everyone thought the patriot act was an awesome idea but look how the NSA has taken the ball and run with it. The simple minded reasoning of ""less guns=less gun deaths"" misses the point entirely. Like it or not guns are part of our history and culture. People will find a way to kill other people in new and interesting ways. Columbine, Aurora, Sandy Hook, Giffords and any other high profile mass shooting all have one other thing in common; all legally purchased firearms not through private sales. That and all of them were mentally disturbed. You want to enact ""sensible gun laws"" go after the mental health care angle, go after laws for securing your weapons. Or just go fuck yourself since anything I say brands me a ""gun nut"""

The Bill of Rights (a misnomer) is a list of restrictions on the government, for the purpose of protecting our inalienable rights. You are correct about one thing: rights go hand in hand with responsibility. If you had a basic understanding of responsibility, which is uncommon among statists, you would realize legislating responsibility defeats the purpose.

Colorado,2wk8ne,tasty-fish-bits,3,Fri Feb 20 19:05:15 2015 UTC,"No, it would be exactly the same as we have now, but everyone could use it instead of just FFL dealers.  How it works currently is the FFL (gun store) contacts a special service of the CBI and gives them the purchasers SSN. The CBI does a brief check and sends the FFL a simple Yes or No answer. A ""No"" will not show a reason why.  This does not mean the person is actually buying a gun or not, it just tells the FFL if they can buy a gun or not. Additionally the CBI has rules that say they cannot legally hold onto the SSN they were given and must destroy it.  Hypothetically there could be a list if the CBI illegally collected the SSNs. And it would also be a bad list since it the person holding the SSN may not have actually bought the gun or have resold it themselves, or any other such things."
Colorado,2wk8ne,TheMrNick,2,Fri Feb 20 19:16:54 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer to skip that process entirely, and just add a simple ""no guns"" symbol to the state-issued ID of any prohibited person.

Check their driver's license for the icon of a gun with a red slash through it, and you'll know immediately whether the person attempting to buy the gun is prohibited from doing so.  Boom. Instant background check with zero need to pick up a phone or enter data into a website.  Hell, if you want, you could even attach a legal penalty for knowingly selling a gun to someone with a marked license, or to someone who refuses to show ID who turns out to be a prohibited person, and I doubt any gun owners would have a problem with that."

Colorado,2wi2t5,ejrado,3,Fri Feb 20 15:44:20 2015 UTC,"The ""injury"" issue (standing, in legal parlance) is the biggest (and likely fatal) flaw in cases brought by other states seeking to challenge the Colorado or Washington laws.  In order to bring a law suit of any kind, you have to show that you are hurt.  That doesn't necessarily apply in the same way to a future federal government, however, which can say it is injured by the state's refusal to enforce federal law.  As to the attorney general, I guess that depends on how much control the governor of Colorado has over the attorney general?  I'm licensed in Colorado, but that didn't require much (any) study of Colorado civics, so I'm not sure exactly how the Colorado executive branch functions."

How does this equate to perceived ""happiness""?   Survey Methods  Results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Dec. 30, 2014, as a part of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, with a random sample of 176,702 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error for the Well-Being Index score is ±0.1 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. The margin of sampling error for most states is about ±0.6 percentage points, although this increases to about ±1.6 points for the smallest-population states such as North Dakota, Wyoming, Hawaii and Delaware. All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting.   Also, telephone interviews of what, an average of ~3,500 people per state?

Yes, I agree with the usual logic that criminals carry guns concealed anyway so why have a permit at all?  But I am in favor of people receiving some level of training and basic explanation of the law if they want to make the serious decision to carry a weapon.  My training helped me to really understand what I was getting into.  People who carry concealed have an obligation to not mess it up for the rest of us and give the left the ability to take away all of our carrying rights, which I am sure many itch to do in private circles.  Edit:  Wow!  I'm glad people to see a lot of people agree with this.    If you are curious to learn more about concealed carry, come join us over on /r/ccw."

I feel like concealed carry should be easy to obtain and should have no serious barriers for law-abiding citizens, but at the same time it's nice knowing the folks carrying have taken a course covering basic safety, legal restrictions/implications, etc.  Not sure if it makes any difference, but I'd say overall I tend to lean a little left (although it varies from issue to issue significantly), and have no itch to take any law abiding citizen's gun rights away or have politicians do it on my behalf. If anything it bothers me that this has become a focal point for politicians in the state and distracted them from other issues, and also served to help polarize politics in the state."

I find it kinda strange that to get a hunting license, I have to take 8 hours worth of class, but to just buy the gun and go shooting I show my ID, fill out a form, wait 10 minutes and swipe a credit card at Walmart and I'm good to go.  Wouldn't it make more sense for me to have the class before buying the gun and then be able to buy my hunting license along with it?  For the record, I own a Remington 870, and plan to purchase a rifle this year.  I also plan to take my kids to a range and teach them with a .22 so they understand and respect guns as well.  I just don't see basic education as a barrier."

The 2nd amendment gets a little interesting because, in theory, I can understand how any government-controlled restriction to access can be viewed as a slippery slope (given the purpose of the 2nd amendment). That said, I also don't think education should be considered a barrier or red tape, but an essential part of ownership.  I think for anyone who plans on carrying on a day to day basis (which, in theory, should include a large portion of CCW holders) that some basic safety/legal training/info is essential- I'd go so far as to say it would be nice for anyone planning to open carry, it would be nice (although that would be harder to institute). On the flip side, I'd like it to be as easy as possible to get through (no financial barriers, issues with red tape, for example) because the more people who complete a basic gun safety course, the better (IMO)."

I would like to see actual basic hands on training with a handgun be made mandatory with the course. Although I am leery at having elected officials determine what is ""basic"".

Adams County: The fees are $152.50 for a new permit and $63 for renewal. Appointment must be scheduled T or Th, 8AM for new 1PM for renewals. *My friend said you have to renew every year but I can't find that stated of their website.   The schedule could be a resource issue so I can live with that. My big thing are the fees and ,if what my friend tells me is true, the renewal time of a permit. All background checks are done through the CBI so I do not see why there would be a huge discrepancy in prices. As far as the difference in renewal time, I am not even sure why that would exist.

Colorado,2we9a6,RustyBoiler,2,Mon Feb 23 11:42:42 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with you on that.  Reason as follows: As long as guns continue to exists in public hands, it's fairly easy for the average person to end up holding one at some point. I've never owned a gun, only a small percentage of people I know own a gun, but almost everyone I know has held one at one point.  I was lucky that the person showing off his new equipment was intelligent enough to do all the safety checking for and with me. Before handing the gun to me, he checked the clip, checked the barrel, checked the clip AGAIN, double checked the safety, and then made sure the barrel was pointed in a safe direction the entire time I held it.  I knew enough that you don't point a gun at a person (unless you intend to use it), but I didn't have a damn clue how to make sure it was safe to hold.  Now the reason I say ""mostly agree with you"" is I don't think it would require and entire class. Maybe a seminar or two. Just enough that if someone does find themselves holding a gun they don't do something stupid with it and accidentally kill someone or shoot their own nuts off."

A lot of us own firearms ourselves, and engage in everything from sport shooting and hunting to ranching and security-related professions.

The legislature wanted to do something in the wake of a spate of mass-murders.  But that won't likely help much without nationwide support.  And even then, the specifics are not that well thought through.     ( Of course I've got some other opinions that the Wayne LaPierre grade crazies will hate.  e.g.:  I think that belt fire modification kits and bump fire stocks are about as far from responsible gun ownership as a person can get, and a general nuisance that ought to be regulated into extinction.  )  I don't think the ammo clip regulation is the firearms apocalypse that the wing nuts are making it out to be either.   I just don't think it's going to be very useful or effective, or make a whole lot of sense.   Reactionary legislation is reactionary.  I'd rather we were working with plans and goals than reactions.

As a gun-owner who's had gun-nuts pull guns on me or shoot near me merely for hiking where they wanted to hunt, I applaud putting rational and reasonable measure into place for background checks and safety requirements."

The vagueness of ""launch a national safe and responsible gun ownership campaign"" is right in line with NSA policies and the like.  Eliminating an exemption and banning are ultimately the same thing. It's absolutely used for sports and hunting. The ATF wants to ban steel in ammo and the EPA wants to ban lead.

And there's always been idiots that have used them to hunt deer and even bears (to very poor effect).   Obviously, they'll do a job on squirrels, possums, etc.   But a .22 long will work as well in this case.   I've had anti-gun nuts threaten my life because I'm a gun owner.

The majority of deaths by guns are accidents that could have been avoided. I'm not against people carrying guns openly or concealed but I want them to be aware of the consequences of doing so. Simply having a weapon on you can invite a higher level of violence directed toward you from an antagonist. Having a weapon on you gives you the option to use deadly force in an extremely easy way. How tempted will you be to use it inappropriately? Law enforcement go through tons of training designed to help them determine when to shoot or not (and they still fuck it up as we have clearly seen). People who carry guns need to be aware of what responsibilities they are taking on and I'd love to see more classes, more training and more education (even for kids) that help reduce accidents. That is why this bill bothers me, it does away with the little bit of required education we have before someone who jumps at shadows decides to stick a deadly weapon in their pocket."

Using just the numbers from the Gun Murders column makes an even stronger argument as the gun murder average for those states is nearly triple that of CO.

By trying to not only loosen restrictions that were only recently put in place (magazine limits, universal background checks, etc) but going for the whole shebang and trying to have even long-standing restrictions relaxed (CCW), they're setting themselves up for failure, and I think they know it- it looks like a token move to me.   If, for example, Republican lawmakers were to try to do something like remove the 15 round magazine limit and fix the weird legal inconsistencies of the new background check laws (while still requiring a background check for a transfer of actual ownership when a gun is sold), it would be much harder for such efforts to be dismissed the other side."

There hasn't been a huge call to remove any restrictions in the CCW process so even getting people on record as opposing the bill doesn't help in elections. I was under the impression that they would try to reverse some, if not all, the gun restrictions put into place. There is a high likelihood that those will not pass the house either.

The 15 round magazine restrictions? Oh, goodness yes. The background check changes (or at least the weird legal implications for things like lending out guns)? Definitely. CCW restrictions? Not so much. It just seems like they're throw it all out there, knowing they'll be less likely to be taken seriously, and then complain when noting sticks.  Conversely, it does appear each issue is going to be addressed independently- if they were a bundle package there would be even less likelihood of EVERYTHING passing as one than some individual issues being revisited."

Colorado,2we9a6,WhiteRaven42,9,Thu Feb 19 14:32:39 2015 UTC,"The natural right is of effective self defense. A gun is arguably the most effective tool available to achieve that right.  You can't truly claim to have the right to do something, if the means to exercise the right are unavailable.  It's one reason why voter ID is a hot button topic. If people haven't the means to acquire ID (because it costs money, for example) then their right to vote is being infringed.  The same can be said for the right to keep and bear arms, and things like permit fees. My concealed carry permit cost about $125, which isn't a lot of money, unless you don't have it. Background checks, permit fees, transfer fees, etc. all contribute to an increase in the cost of exercising that natural right, which is grossly and disproportionately unfair to people without means."
Colorado,2we9a6,JoeRmusiceater,2,Thu Feb 19 19:33:44 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Put that way, the argument maks sense, although i would argue with the premise that a gun is the most effective form of self-defense (or even moderately effective)."

And probably keep landmines and cluster-bombs in cases of severe trespassing?  Or is it possible that we can be reasonable and honest with ourselves that 99.999% of our population doesn't really need guns, and shouldn't carry guns?

The point is that most criminals don't want to carry a gun since they tend to run into the law a lot, and it's one more reason to get arrested, checked out in far greater detail, etc.    So, the guy who might steal your car?  Probably doesn't carry a gun. The guy who might break into your home when you're not around to steal your tv?  Probably doesn't carry a gun. The guy who's going to steal your life savings through identity theft?  Yep, you guessed it - no gun. But how about that group of guys that are going to invade your home?   Yep, they'll have guns.  Of course, your chances of running into them is far less likely than being hit by lightening 3 times.   Far less likely than getting into a fatal car wreck.

Anyone over 21 can legally purchase a gun without any training, and there is nothing stopping them from (illegally) concealing it. (Also, it's legal to cc in your car, home, or business without a permit)  I've had a few friends caught concealing handguns illegally, the police pretty much just told them to go get a permit. The punishment for owning brass knuckles is worse.   You are also overestimating the ""training"" aspect.

I tend to agree that I'm not sure this resides in the executive branch's realm of power.  I'm torn on the issue: like I said above, I'm glad the area is being protected, but I don't like the government overstepping their bounds. (Granted, there's also a valid argument that the feds overstep their bounds when it comes to land ownership in general, but that's for a different topic)  How do we bridge the gap, though?  The Republicans quoted in the story don't like this move -- they call it a ""land grab"" and decry that the feds aren't supposed to do it.  The dems want it done, and offer up a way to get it done.  Given that keeping land public and open to the people at large is a huge way of life here in the west, we need a way to do so, even when the parties are at odds.

Colorado,2wbon0,ApatheticBear,6,Wed Feb 18 20:44:42 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd say that the states lost a lot of power when it took the federal government to keep the country together and some states still prevented a gigantic population of black from voting for another 100 years (in some states as few as 5% of blacks were registered voters by 1960).  And if people think that federal government is corrupt, they need to check out what's going on at the state level.  One might think since it's smaller & closer it's cleaner, but the opposite is true.  Mostly due to lack of visibility.   Anyhow, the states will be the first people to privatize and give this land away to developer connections.    So, saving land like this, I believe has to be done by the federal government."

How do you decide, then, that if that person cared they would feel a particular way?"
Colorado,2w3r7x,303uru,14,Tue Feb 17 04:20:15 2015 UTC,I think Asatora's point is exactly that.

Colorado,2w3r7x,Jackalopecia,52,Mon Feb 16 22:31:12 2015 UTC,"Good question.  I was curious too, so I asked over at /r/water.  Here's a good response:   Conventional wastewater treatment plants often combine physical processes such as sieving and sedimentation as well as biological processes to clean the water. The physical processes remove impurities such as sand, cellulose (from your toilet paper!) and lots of other relatively large particles. In the biological process, the wastewater gets mixed in an aerated tank with lots and lots of bacteria, the so-called activated-sludge, which break down most of the chemicals harmful for the environment, such as ammonium, phosphate and organic material. The problem with microbeads, microscopically small plastic particles, is that the conventional systems are simply not equipped to remove them. They are way too small to be removed by physical processes such as sieves, and are not broken down by the activated sludge. Although some beads are captured by sinking particles and sludge in the sedimentation tanks, a large fraction passes straight through the treatment plant and enters the surface waters. There are some installations, such as membrane-bioreactors that use special membranes with a very small pore size, that are capable of removing microbeads. They are, however, very expensive to build and operate and use a lot more energy compared to the conventional systems. Therefore, it is a lot better to prevent the microbeads from ever entering wastewater then to invest a huge amount of money to upgrade existing installations."

If I not only seized your car and any valuables in it but also your bank account you would have a very hard time paying a lawyer to get it back.  That this happens without the invocation of any criminal proceedings is horrifying enough, but that people carry on with the ""it'll never happen to me attitude"" is even worse, and guarantees that this will stretch on far longer than it should be allowed to."

For the rest of your points: Slippery slope to confiscation: Considering this is the stated goal of a lot of anti-gun politicians, can you blame gun owners for distrusting them?  That's about as smart as putting climate-change-denying politicians in charge of the EPA and expecting them to do a good job. Open Carry Types: Most gun owners think these guys are nutjobs and do more to hurt the cause than help it. The NRA: Thanks for assuming I support them.  The NRA are idiots.  I prefer the SAF.  Again, you are stereotyping an entire segment of the population based on a minority.  That sounds familiar, doesn't it?

Again, makes one kind of bitter.  I'm generally a pretty liberal guy.  Voted Obama twice, think we need UHC and gay marriage and legal pot.    We don't have a ""Gun Violence"" problem in America.  We have a Violence problem (although overall, violent crime is decreasing) brought on by racism (institutionalized and otherwise), a widening wealth gap, a refusal to take mental health seriously, and an overall hostile attitude by a lot of people towards anyone with views perceived as different from theirs."
Colorado,2w422t,GringodelRio,-14,Tue Feb 17 19:21:14 2015 UTC,"Considering I haven't heard any reasonable suggestions from the Pro-Gun crowd, are you surprised? This being the same crowd that not only freaked out when Obama was elected screaming that the Feds were going to come in and take their guns, but after EVERY major shooting incident doesn't grieve, doesn't mourn... they run straight to Cabelas or whatever shop of their choosing and load up on ammo and guns. The same group of people who cannot go anywhere without their trusty sidearm, because that minute chance they'll be there to save the day.  You don't have rational conversations with people whose first reactions to a school full of children getting shot and killed is to run out and buy guns and ammo. I'm sorry, but it just doesn't jive with ""rational"". You know, instead of taking time to mourn the senseless tragedy and come to the table and discuss what could really work for improving safety.  Considering far too many gun owners do not adhere to the very basic rules of gun safety (every gun should be treated as loaded until otherwise verified; guns are not stored unlocked, nor loaded; the gun is locked separate from the ammo; when carrying, the safety is on at all times; if you pull the gun out, it is either because you intend to kill someone with it/shoot something with it, or you're unloading it and securing it - you don't wave it around nor do you hand it to your friend loaded; a loaded, unlocked gun does not get carried in a purse, ever; etc.), do you really expect anyone to listen? Or give a damn?  Tell you what. If gun owners around this country could take some personal initiative and actually handle their pieces correctly and when something happens not go all nutter and run out to the gun shop, we can have a conversation. Until then, loosen those throat muscles because more is going to be rammed down the throat of gun owners, something I'd really rather not see but I'm not given much to work with from the other side here."
Colorado,2w422t,LetsGetMotarded,12,Tue Feb 17 18:46:04 2015 UTC,"The discussion about safety aside, your attitude is pretty much the reason gun owners are wary of working with the anti-gun crowd.  There is very little to gain when the attitude of the opposing side is   ""You are all nutters, and compromise means I get 100% of what I want and you get nothing"".  In fact, you could replace guns with Universal Health Care and it almost sounds like the Right during the healthcare debate."
Colorado,2w422t,GringodelRio,-12,Tue Feb 17 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"Folks wouldn't look at the pro-gun crowd AS nutters if they didn't actively prove that point. Again, I'll go right back to my examples.  The US elects Obama, they freak out thinking the fed is going to come in and take their guns, and thus buy more. Considering that is not likely to happen, ever, regardless of how lib the President is. Am I supposed to not see that as a nutter response?  Or when a school full of kids get shot up. Am I supposed to see running out to buy more guns and ammo as a rational response?  So, what you're saying is, the gun-control crowd (very few of us are anti-gun, we just are tired of the body count) should completely ignore the batshit insanity that comes from the NRA/Pro-Gun side of things?  The gun control side of this debate is very open to a rational discussion. We're just waiting for some rationality to come from the pro-gun side of things.  MagPul is a good example. Instead of going ""Woah, wait, let's talk this over"", they pack up their toys and leave. Instead of coming out and saying ""Look, I know where this is coming from, but this isn't going to do anything, here are our suggestions for some sensible reform, and we like UBC's, and we think that mental health is getting the shaft so we would like to donate 5% of all of our proceeds to a fund setup to support free mental health services.""  No, it's ""Fine. We're leaving!"""
Colorado,2w422t,SkullCollector,9,Tue Feb 17 19:41:07 2015 UTC,"LOL so according to you, the only ""compromise"" that Magpul could have made was to bend over and take it up the ass.  Stop selling their #1 product in their home state, AND donate 5% to a cause that nobody, not even the government seems to give a fuck about?    Nice ""compromise"" bro."

Colorado,2w422t,_DoctorMidnight,6,Tue Feb 17 20:13:52 2015 UTC,"Don't be sorry, this doesn't apply to any gun owner I know.  You probably saw a CNN report or some shit about some nut doing that, and out of fear you felt the need to project that image onto every other gun owner in the country.  That's just prejudice.  You can apologize for your irrational generalization if you like, but there's no need.  None of what you said has any truth with regard to the vast majority of gun owners, so don't be sorry."
Colorado,2w422t,GringodelRio,-2,Tue Feb 17 20:35:54 2015 UTC,"My brother worked in a sporting goods store right after Sandy Hook. The line for the gun counter was across the building (a place the size of a sprouts) within 3 hours of the shooting.  By noon the following day, they were sold out of several different caliburs of ammo.  I figured it was just a local issue where he lives at, but my first boss (a gun store owner) and I talked a few days later and he remarked the same thing happened there.  So, no, it's not something I just happened to read in the liberal times. I know it doesn't apply to every gun owner, but enough of them."
Colorado,2w422t,TheEmperorsChampion,3,Tue Feb 17 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"These checks actually do very little if anything,by the wording of it, it is technically illegal for me, in my home, to hand my friend a gun. The current background check system was already fine as it was, there was no 'gun show loophole' or any of that, it's just another ineffective feel good measure like 90% of gun control laws are, and just makes it even more annoying on the people who actually follow the law.   If they REALLY wanted to cure gun violence, they would take a look the where the majority of deaths come from, which are gang/drug related, and suicide, as much as 90%! So no, it's not a 'gun' or 'violent' person problem, its a socio-economic and mental health issue but politicians refuse to see it as such, as do gun control advocates, and continue to pass arbitrary, inefficient, and meaningless laws that do not solve the root problems and only continue to  annoy and hamper law abiding gun owners."

Can they still get one? Sure, but it's harder, they have to have the right connections.  Also, consider this little factoid: most of the mass shootings occur with individuals who up until they pull the trigger have no criminal records. It's not an absolute fix, much like most laws aren't absolute fixes. Having smoke detectors in all homes don't prevent all fatalities from fires, it prevents many. UBC makes it harder for former cons and those who have had their right revoked from just walking in and buying.  Buying a gun shouldn't be as easy as buying a bottle of water from a convenience store. There really is no reason for it. It's a major purchase of something that has a limited range of use, primarily hitting a target, usually a live one, with the intent of killing it.

While this is true, it also makes it less convenient for the professional and keeps out the non-professional.  Likewise, background checks on guns means someone who's not allowed to own firearms is deprived of simply walking into a store to buy a gun.  They'll have to buy it illegally, taking a risk on the purchase, and paying more for it.   These are all imperfects but helpful deterrents."

There are obvious benefits to this but these also command a premium over a stolen firearm, but this can be traced back to whomever originally bought the firearm.   Most cons indeed probably do not use these options, or at least the black market, and thus many steal firearms, only very 'serious' criminals would spend the time, money, and effort to actually purchase a weapon without a serial number."

Colorado,2vxlmy,-_eeeeee_-,3,Sun Feb 15 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"So, the math is a bit weird, so bare with me.  The marijuana tax law states there is a normal sales tax of 2.9%, with an additional 15% specifically for weed. 10% of that 15% goes to the local governments (read: cities and counties). The remainder is state taxes, which is distributed by the state.  So what you get is $125.3 million in taxes, $10.5 million of which is divided up by the places that actually sell it. The rest goes into state coffers to be handed out like any other funds, for schools, roads, and the like.  So yes, places like the springs do get a cut even though we don't sell it in the city proper."

Colorado,2vnzkm,ashtonias,14,Sun Feb 15 02:25:58 2015 UTC,"You actually don't have to pay if you go to court and fight it.  A camera taking a photo and then an arbitrary (not law enforcement) person evaluates whether or not you get a ticket.   You can't face your accuser in court (6th amend violation).  Also, the only thing it proves is that the vehicle registered to you was speeding, not YOU were speeding. Thus, if they can't prove you were the person behind the wheel, they can't ticket you. Oh, and the company (so not the government/police) calibrates the sensors. And the company gets a commission off the tickets paid.   Camera tickets are total bullshit and should be fought. It's an easy way to get money from those unaware of their legal rights. Hence, why some states are trying to get rid of them now, because people are realizing the tickets don't stand up in court- http://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-ohio/bill-expected-to-put-traffic-cameras-out-of-business-in-ohio  Granted that's ohio and not Colorado, but you make the exact same arguments."

The confusion occurs because there is a Denver law that says the tickets have to be personally served, so Denver tickets are unenforceable unless they knock on your door.  In other cities, they could send you to collections (and I think they do, rarely) or even put out a bench warrant (which absolutely never happens).  The real kicker about automated tickets is that state law allows only a fine as punishment. It can't, no matter what, give you points on your license, so you'll never get a ""real"" punishment (like a suspended license, or jail time, or even jacked up insurance rates) for unpaid red light tickets."

Service is required. However, as I presume you're pointing out, a note later in the statute distinguishes instances of ""personal"" service.   The point, though, is that there is no real legal distinction between ""service"" and ""personal service"" in Colorado. Ostensibly, the only way to effect service is to personally serve."

Colorado,2vnzkm,fxgn,8,Thu Feb 12 19:02:27 2015 UTC,They can't count it as being served because you were never technically served. You must take possession of the notice before it can be considered served.

Colorado,2vnzkm,probablyreasonable,3,Fri Feb 13 04:52:34 2015 UTC,"It's no big deal to not deal with strangers at your door for 90 days. Personally I prefer not to answer the door for strangers anyway; they're never there for my benefit. Nine times out of ten they want to sell you something, and the other time they want something from you for free."
Colorado,2vnzkm,Eclectix,1 point,Fri Feb 13 04:59:36 2015 UTC,"I suppose it's bad news, then that you don't have to be personally served at your home?   You can be served at work, at the grocer, on your morning walk... literally anywhere. If you get pulled over, or have to file a police report, or register a business name, you can easily get served by an officer.   My (admittedly sarcastic) point in the previous reply is that it is a bit silly to shut down for 90 days trying to avoid service. Either don't speed, pay the lesser fine conveniently, or face the music when you're served.   IMO $40 is well worth not having to think about a legal issue hanging over my head. Is is extortion? Maybe. But frankly, its purpose is to motivate me not to speed, and I don't anymore.   I'd say the tickets had their desired effect."
Colorado,2vnzkm,probablyreasonable,3,Fri Feb 13 05:03:15 2015 UTC,"It's a gamble.  You either bet $30 extra bucks that you won't get served, and if you win you pay nothing, or you just pay the $40 and play it safe. I'm betting they won't bother hiring a PI to follow you around shopping or wait for you at the public records office in case you come in to file a business name. They just might send an officer to your door if you have an address within the city and county of Denver because it won't cost them much to do it, but it's not very likely that they'd waste their time sending an officer out to Centennial or up to Boulder or whatever in order to collect forty bucks, especially when there's a good chance you could still beat the citation in court."
Colorado,2vnzkm,Eclectix,2,Fri Feb 13 07:24:33 2015 UTC,It's extremely unlikely you'll be served anywhere but your home.  It's a huge jump in the amount of work that the process server would have to do in order to serve you anywhere else.  Not worth it for a $40 ticket.
Colorado,2vnzkm,Chartzilla,2,Fri Feb 13 16:04:55 2015 UTC,"Sure is. But that doesn't change the risk analysis above. We can certainly expand that to a simple expectation:  Pay the ticket - expected cost is $40  Ignore the ticket - expected cost is 1% chance of being served x $70 = $0.70  Certainly, it's the economically prudent decision to just wait it out, but even that is not worth it to many people. Simply not triggering the cameras by not speeding is the simplest solution."
Colorado,2vnzkm,probablyreasonable,1 point,Fri Feb 13 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"The only problem is that they will also get you for running a red light, which in some cases is literally unavoidable (the majority of left-turn arrows have yellow lights which are far too short to give people sufficient time to clear the intersection, which is why 80% of mail-in red light citations are left turns).  ALL this aside, though, of course the best solution is to obey traffic laws to avoid citations. After all, if you are caught speeding by an actual cop and personally written a citation then the entire point becomes moot."
Colorado,2vnzkm,Eclectix,11,Fri Feb 13 18:38:10 2015 UTC,"I've beat 3 tickets like this. Just go to court and ask for calibration records. The cameras have to be calibrated every 3 months to be valid. If they were calibrated, ask to face your accuser."

Colorado,2vnzkm,drocks27,2,Fri Feb 13 08:08:18 2015 UTC,FYI: This goes for pretty much any state. You must be served in person. The whole certified mail thing is weird because the USPS isn't supposed to be able to server court papers. I'm not too sure about that though.

Colorado,2vnzkm,Kujo_A2,1 point,Fri Feb 13 13:41:40 2015 UTC,"The title of the article is misleading and the information presented within the article is wrong. Under §42-4-110.5 process does not have to be personally served (as the article leads on) rather, the statute clearly allows both personal service or service through the mail. The lawyer is correct in saying that you won't be penalized unless there is personal service, but, if there is personal service of process then you do have to pay the ticket.   What you are gambling on here is that the city won't actually carry out the service of process. My girlfriend was personally served a her home in Fort Collins. Others in this thread have reported the same. Given that by law you are required to pay for the service of process, it is not against the cities' interests to send the process out to non responding defendants.   The thesis of this article is that you are not required to pay for the ticket unless it is personally served is simply untrue; if you get the letter in the mail then you are required to respond. Of course the city can't prove that you actually received the letter, so they can't enter a default judgement  against you (which they can do if you fail to respond after the process is served). This doesn't change your legal obligation to pay."

Normally if markets can't meet consumer needs in cases like this, we create credits and tax breaks. What this law does is shift the economic incentive away from higher quality standards, and puts the burden on the consumer. Eroding consumer protections, and creating a special protected class of business helps only that special class.  If the 10k cost of insurance on a 200k home is so burdensome, why don't we create a 5k first time home buyer credit, and a 3k builder tax break. Everybody wins, no one needs to permanently lose their rights, and Republicans can claim they cut taxes, or some other such nonsense."

But that doesn't negate the fact that it is a boring lager with a bland taste. There are plenty of better tasting lagers than Budweiser.   That being said, fuck Budweiser for their condescending ad. They are trying to defend it, but the intention was clear: they don't want craft beer drinkers buying their beer. And I'll gladly not do that. I'll go drink a Shift, which is also a lager, and way better."

Loser!"" and with coffee, Apple or Android, etc. I don’t wear skinny jeans and what's wrong with having a personal preference? Those of us who like Coors Light don't presume to tell others what beer is best. I am ok with the commercial, even though i am not a fan of most of their products. It was funny. Craft beer hipsters need to lose the persecution complex. They are the ones who look down on the rest of us, not the other way around. I am free to like whatever beers i want!

One if the roles of government is to ensure fair standards of measurement. A mile on a car's odo must be a mile, a gallon of milk must be a gallon. What they could have done is made a law to enforce fair standards of sizing, so that 8 oz is a small, 16 oz is a medium, and 20 oz is large, etc. Restaurants could still serve large ass drinks, but they'd have to label them truthfully, i.e. ""XXL"" - everyone is happy. This doesn't even conflict with government overreach IMHO."

In what world is 24 oz of soda ""medium""? It's deceptive in the inverse manner.   The reason for the deceit is simply different. Where the gallon of milk being smaller than a gallon of liquid deceives the customer financially, the medium drink being anything but medium deceives the customer in a different manner.  Each is designed to facilitate a clear exchange of information between the seller and the buyer and to protect the rights of both in the transaction."
Colorado,2vdm61,Cenomaniac,4,Thu Feb 12 00:29:29 2015 UTC,"In what world is 24 oz of soda ""medium""?   ""Medium"" is not a standardized measurement.  If I offer three sizes, the middle one is legitimately called medium.  It doesn't matter if I'm selling shots of liquor in 1, 2, and 3 oz shot glasses or team drink coolers in 5, 10 and 15 gallon.  The one in the middle is medium by definition.  Yes, you can pass a law that redefines the word ""medium"" to mean 24 oz instead of ""the one in the middle"", but by my definition, that's legislative overreach with a questionable agenda."

I'm not saying this is a great solution, I'm just saying it bothers me less than an outright ban.

Maybe you haven't read my posts?  In your own analogy about alcohol, the ABV and size of the container are required to be labeled. A standard size for a bottle of liquor is 750 ml, for example. Putting in place rules for the exchange of information during business transactions is not a ban, period, nor does it really infringe on personal choice.   Laws regarding the exchange of information in transactions are actually to protect liberties. It is your right to know the overall total of all the accrued interest for the entire term of a loan up front, for example."

Don't put up that straw man.  The NY law goes way beyond labeling.

A true false dichotomy would be thinking either you ban or you don't. I never said anything like that. All I suggested was implementing a standard of sizing, and it IS better than a ban with respect to civil liberties, since it does not prevent anyone from doing what they want to do.    The NY law goes way beyond labeling. It's more like saying you can only sell liquor in pints, not 750ml and certainly not handles because we don't think it's good for you.   Now who is using a straw man argument? ALL I suggested was that standardizing sizes of drinks according to SOME scale, i.e. assigning SOME amount, in oz, to a S/M/L/XL soft drink size, would be an option which wouldn't be as restrictive and egregiously in violation of natural liberties. All I suggested was a simple standard of cup size to prevent size inflation and to allow customers to easily judge how much soda they want no matter which restaurant they are in. In fact I said that there shouldn't be any restrictions on how much you can get or refill."

Colorado,2v8xg8,xicougar106,1 point,Tue Feb 10 03:12:21 2015 UTC,"Don't know how you'd get it into schools.  You'd have to fight local school boards and teachers' unions, to say nothing of the general populace.  You'd see a tsunami of outside money and influence coming in to attack you as well.  Certainly Bloomberg and Gates would spend millions to defeat it.  Under this president, the Dept of Ed would get involved, probably threatening to cut federal funding.  Even if you succeeded you'd have to have an opt out choice like there is for sex ed and you'd have teachers interjecting their own personal biases into it.  My sex ed teacher was sexually assaulted in college and became a lesbian because of it and if you think my sex ed class wasn't colored by her eternal hatred of men or that we didn't miss crucial information because she couldn't present it  objectively, you'd be sorely mistaken.  Teachers will bring those same prejudices to a subject that's just as contentious and having a polarizing group like the NRA teaching it is right out.  I'm not wholesale disagreeing with you, so please don't take it that way.  I just think that there is a tremendously better way of going about it.  I hate the government in virtually every form I encounter it (Hi, NSA, it's me again).  One of the key reasons why I hate them is because I can do things better than they can.  I have personally changed the minds of 6 anti-gunners.  I would get into a cordial debate and bring the issue to a head by asking if they'd ever handled a firearm.  Invariably the answer was ""no,"" and I offered to test how open their minds were and to take them shooting.  The half dozen that accepted found that 'gun culture' is not what they anticipated, because I gave them a real look at what it is.  I am probably over-zealous when it comes to safety (I require that they have the 4 laws memorized and ask them to restate the purpose of each in their own words before we so much as unload the cars at the range), but I find that presenting a strictly safety conscious culture is just the sort of culture shock they need.    We always start with .22s.  We always stress learning safe handling practices when the stakes are lower and the task is easier.  We then work up to higher recoil rounds and stop when they're uncomfortable.  Lots of times at the range it's about one-upping your buddy.  This isn't one of those times.  It's all about them on that trip to the range.  Sure, show them how hard work and practice pay off, because they'll not likely be crack shots right off the bat, but don't go on a home run derby run while they're still playing T-Ball.  In the end, they all say ""well you're one of the good gun owners,"" but I point out that everyone else at the range is too, that we ""good gun owners"" make up the extreme, hyper-majority of gun owners, and they invariably soften.  Some more than others, and your milage will vary.  One gal went from hating the thought of her sons owning nerf guns to owning 2 pistols and a shotgun for home defense and asking me for recommendations for affordable ARs.  Most have just been more inclined to accept that their position needs revising.  My point is, I have done a lot more than a gov't program ever could by taking people shooting.  And even though it costs me more than the taxes to support a gov't program could, that actually ends up being a selling point.  I freely tell them that I am eating the ammo costs because I want them to experience everything that shooting sports have to offer and $25 of ammo isn't going to get them anywhere.  Blowing through $300 of ammo to turn a hard-line anti into a moderate is money I'll spend every time."

Colorado,2v8xg8,Theune,13,Mon Feb 9 18:12:06 2015 UTC,"You read all those stories because the media outlets report them. MSNBC and CNN, for example, have open anti-gun stances. When we hear about these incidents, they are usually framed in the context of gun ownership rather than encouraging proper training and discipline.   In a country with 300 million people, accidents happen. Just by the size of our country there will constantly be bad things happening every day in all categories of society. It's very sad, but what we hear about is not an accurate statistical representation of what actually does/does not statistically occur every day.   Considering how many millions of gun owners there are, the rate of incidents is actually remarkably low. Encouraging and supporting training would make those numbers even lower. Would banning and confiscating all guns probably lower them? Yep, but gun ownership is a fundamental right. It plays a role in defining the United States as a country ruled only by the permission of the people."
Colorado,2v8xg8,RustyBoiler,0,Mon Feb 9 18:25:05 2015 UTC,"You completely ignored his point. The US had 10.3 gun deaths per 100,000, while the UK has 0.23, Australia 0.86, Canada 2.39. The media isn't lying when they say we have a lot more gun violence.  While I'm not for banning guns, I think its important to keep those statistics in mind when you're discussing gun control laws. To many reasonable people, the numbers in the US are unreasonably high and the correlative factor is gun ownership."

That has nothing to do with magazine size.  Sure, I can kill myself with an AR that has a 150 round magazine, but the other 149 have nothing to do with suicide.

I can kill myself with an AR that has a 150 round magazine   You'd need really long arms though.   as discussing which NFL team is going to win next year's Super Bowl based off the combined hotness of their cheerleaders.

Colorado,2v8xg8,Theune,4,Tue Feb 10 02:00:25 2015 UTC,"Most mass shooters acquired their guns after completing a background check, so I find it odd you think someone should be imprisoned for selling a gun to a close personal friend who, say, already has a large, legally-owned gun collection, a concealed carry permit, and a clean criminal record.  As for addressing mass shooting events, magazine bans do exactly nothing.  Eric Harris fired nearly two times the number of rounds of Dylan Klebold during Columbine, this despite the fact that he was wielding a gun with ten round magazines, and Klebold had ""high capacity"" magazines.  The Virginia Tech shooter managed to pull off the worst mass shooting on US soil, and he did it with a mixture of ten and fifteen round magazines, which are completely legal in Colorado.  Even the Sandy Hook shooter didn't bother to empty the magazines he carried, instead opting to execute tactical reloads at opportune times in order to keep the advantage in his favor.  If magazine capacity mattered, there would be a strong correlation between mass shooting events, magazines, and number of people killed, but such a correlation is hard to draw, partially because such events are exceedingly rare, and partially because magazine capacity is pretty far down the list of things that enable a mass shooter.  In order to believe that a magazine ban has any sort of effect, you have to believe the following:  1.) That a magazine ban can be enforced in any meaningful way. Since we're talking about hundreds of millions of devices which are cheap, essentially untraceable, and about as complicated as a travel mug, claiming such a ban is enforceable is clearly delusional.  2.) You have to believe that reloading a firearm is an arduous or difficult procedure. It isn't. Even someone completely new to firearms can be taught to execute a reload in two-three seconds.  3.) You have to believe that in that 2-3 second time interval, a victim will be able to recognize the following: - That the assailant has run out of ammunition and needs to reload - Assess the situation - Choose to either run for an exit or attempt to engage an armed assailant in a physical fight.  And that's all assuming that the assailant isn't using tactical reloads (Sandy Hook), retreating slightly to reload (Virginia Tech), or armed with more than one gun (most every mass shooting.)   People who think that magazine bans will have some sort of positive effect on violent crime or mass shootings are utterly, completely deluded."

Furthermore, it clearly belies the motives of the gun control set as being fundamentally unconcerned with overall violence or suicide rates, and that they're ok living in a world where shootings are replaced with death by other means in a one-to-one relationship.  Furthermore, even going with the lowest reasonable estimates of defensive gun uses, which are approximately 100,000 annually, it's clear that the use and ownership of firearms has an overall positive societal impact, and that's even if you manage to completely ignore all of the positives that come with gun ownership and use for recreational and sporting purposes."

(Suicide rate for White Males who own a firearm is literally 10x that of the US population as a whole.)  Which also means that about half 32,000 annual shooting deaths are a mix of homicide, accidents, and unclassified.   In a country with 300 million people, accidents happen   In the US, the Intentional Homicide rate per 100k people is more than double that of any other G7 Nation.  (Triple all of them except Canada)    America has a greater shooting death problem, both homicidal and suicidal, than any other G7 nation no matter how you slice it.  By a big margin.   You cannot pretend that it isn't a problem, and hope it all just blows over.  If we fail to address the underlying causes of that in a meaningful way, gun rights always will be under ever-increasing scrutiny.

If it were as simple as ""more guns=more gun deaths"" then Switzerland should have an outrageous number of firearm-related deaths.   In some 2001 statistics, it is noted that there are about 420,000 assault rifles (fully automatic, or ""selective fire"") stored at private homes, mostly SIG SG 550 models. Additionally, there are some 320,000 semi-auto rifles and military pistols exempted from military service in private possession, all selective-fire weapons having been converted to semi-automatic operation only. In addition, there are several hundred thousand other semi-automatic small arms classified as carbines. The total number of firearms in private homes is estimated minimally at 1.2 million to 3 million.[7][broken citation]  In 2005 over 10% of households contained handguns, compared to 18% of U.S. households that contained handguns. In 2005 almost 29% of households in Switzerland contained firearms of some kind, compared to almost 43% in the US.[8]   So, does having very large numbers of automatic rifles and a high rate of gun ownership equate to a high rate of firearm-related homicides?   Government statistics for the year 2010[19] records 40 homicides involving firearms, out of the 53 cases of homicide in 2010.  The annual rate of homicide by any means per 100,000 population was 0.70, which is one of the lowest in the world.[20] However, the annual rate of homicide by guns per 100,000 population was 0.52, which is higher than neighboring countries'.[21]   It sure doesn't seem like it.  The US very obviously has a problem with gun violence, but whether or not restricting access to firearms would solve that problem is a far more complicated question, and the idea that ease of access is the primary underlying cause does not do the complexity of this issue justice."

If you run a statistical analysis, there is a very strong correlation.   There are outliers.  And there are a mix of factors, poverty rate being also a very strong correlation.     But the presence and proximity of firearms does have a measurable effect on the rate of both homicides and shooting deaths.

I bought my AK cause it's just a neat thing with a lot of history behind it, built my AR cause it's kind of cool seeing how it goes together and works, and all my other guns for similar reasons.   I get what you are saying.  Just pointing out that the average gun owner as portrayed by the media these days is probably not the source of most gun violence in America.  We'd be better served by going after the causes of things like inner-city violence than just going after guns.  The big issue is that both sides are adversarial in the gun argument and neither side wants to be fair to the other.  Easier to rally folks behind improving social safety nets and education programs.    That said, most gun owners are open to things like universal background checks when implemented in a sane manner.

It is, in fact, redundant, as the power to regulate firearms is not included in the Enumerated Powers of Congress. Additionally, the militia consists of every man, woman, and child, age 17-45.

On the other hand, if you're using ""regulated"" in the modern sense, I assume you mean to use the term in a manner that implies forcing people you disagree with politically to be at the beck and call of an onerous bureaucracy.

I support this measure.  Multi-round magazines (and Colorado restrictions on them) do not significantly affect gun violence. They can still be bought just over the border in Wyoming. Probably from the same fireworks stands everyone goes to.  Furthermore, AR-15s are not a scary military weapon. I'd argue that perfectly legal and never-gonna-be-banned shotguns with multiple-round capacity are a more effective and deadly weapon for human urban violent terrorism. See the Aurora theatre shooting.  Conversely, I do however SUPPORT strong background checks.

The law has no basis...mass shooters in nearly every case buy a gun from a gun store using the standard background check system. Criminals continue to get guns by stealing them or illegally purchasing them.  It places undue difficulty on citizens for absolutely no benefit.
Colorado,2v8xg8,Silencerco,4,Mon Feb 9 17:54:10 2015 UTC,"There is no ban on private transfers. It just requires a background check. After columbine they passed a law that closed the ""gun show loophole."" This just expands that to any private sale in colorado.  Mag ban needs to go though."
Colorado,2v8xg8,Gravee,5,Mon Feb 9 19:49:40 2015 UTC,"It's a ban as much as the mag ban is. To loan or sell a firearm you need to: 1) Find an FFL willing to do them (rare), 2) Spend the $25+ to do it, 3) Travel to said FFL during open times and convenient for both parties. You can count on one hand the number of FFLs in the Denver metro area that do private party transfers. I can't imagine living somewhere halfway rural.  With the mag ban, all you need to do is go to WY.  The private party transfer ban has absolutely DESTROYED the hobby and market, and has made criminals out of people who do not comply due to the onus on those who live in rural areas. Mission accomplished, right? It's kind of funny, though. People just keep their guns instead of trading, and buy new ones from dealers. So in the end, there's more and more guns entering the state."
Colorado,2v8xg8,autowikibot,5,Mon Feb 9 20:19:41 2015 UTC,It sounds like the problem with this is that FFLs are able to refuse the background check. Not sure why any gun proponent would do that other than as some kind of boycott to block people's ability to do a private sale and then try to point the finger at this law as some kind of ban.  It sounds like a better solution would be to make providing background checks compulsory for FFLs to private sellers. Or to open up the ability for private citizens to run background checks themselves.
Colorado,2v8xg8,multi-gunner,2,Mon Feb 9 21:25:07 2015 UTC,"It's just not financially worth it.  The FFLs are forbidden from charging a market rate for background checks, while still being forced to go through the same process of gathering data, walking the customer through the process, and submitting the information via the NICs system, which will tie up an employee for around an hour or two.  On top of that, they're then required to abide by all of the same record keeping requirements (entering the information into a bound book, keeping the physical 4473 on file for twenty years or more) that they have to abide by for a gun that they actually would have sold.  If any part of that process is done incorrectly, say, a procedural error in how the form is filled out (e.g. the person doing the transfer abbreviated Colorado as CO on the form) the dealer can be punished for the transgression during an ATF inspection.  Given the fact that there's no money in it, the process is a significant time sink, and it comes with a whole host of liabilities, it's really no surprise that dealers are refusing to do these transfers."
Colorado,2v8xg8,Chartzilla,2,Mon Feb 9 21:34:25 2015 UTC,"I can see your point, but in counter my local ffl charges a fee for the transfer in addition to the $10 background check. They're making money doing what they do every day anyway.  If the paperwork is too difficult to deal with for an ffl then they probably are in the wrong line of work."
Colorado,2v8xg8,Gravee,1 point,Mon Feb 9 21:40:49 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of some FFLs that also charge a fee, but, as I understand it, they're not really supposed to per the wording of the law.  There may be some wiggle room by calling it a service fee or something, though."
Colorado,2v8xg8,multi-gunner,4,Tue Feb 10 13:07:51 2015 UTC,"I speak of the onus on the citizen...but the onus is even greater for an FFL.  The FFL has the option to refuse because there are circumstances where they are completely at risk from performing the transfer. For example, if they transfer the firearm into their log book and turns out the serial number was reported stolen, they have to take the firearm and store it for the ATF. Meaning two very angry customers and a mountain of paperwork.  In another scenario, they must take the firearm into their log book and attempt to transfer it to the receiving party. If the receiving party is denied (maybe they forgot to pay a parking ticket), they must then charge and transfer the firearm back to the original owner. And if THEY didn't pay a ticket, suddenly the FFL has a new firearm they must store and are held responsible for. The parties must figure out what they'll do...sell it to the FFL, get the FFL to accept to store it until the background check issues are resolved, or something else.  Saying something should be ""compulsory"" is where you show your stripes...demanding compulsory business is a dangerous road. Where does it end? Are FFLs required to be open certain hours for ""compulsory"" transfers? Can a party knock on the FFL's door at any time of night and demand a transfer? Making it required is something the legislature considered but abandoned in the end, one of many flaws.  My main point is, there's no reason for it. Just as closing the ""gun show loophole"" did nothing, this does nothing. There was no original problem and no reason to criminalize private party business. This object is MINE. This object I PAID for. I should not be hindered in receiving monetary value for my property. Can you think of anything you own that you can't sell without paying someone else to submit a background check? The common example is a car...I can sign my title over to someone on the street at any moment.  Selling a firearm to a criminal has always been illegal. It has always been the transferor's responsibility to take due diligence before selling a firearm. Making it ""more illegal"" (and illegal for what was no crime)  does nothing."
Colorado,2v8xg8,bucknuggets,1 point,Tue Feb 10 15:29:40 2015 UTC,"Just as closing the ""gun show loophole"" did nothing, this does nothing.    I think fundamentally we disagree on this point. You're slippery slope about compulsory bg check running is valid. But that doesn't mean we can't do things about it, like incentivize it instead of making it mandatory. Big tax breaks and such. Whatever.  But to say it's useless I think is going too far. Consider a scenario where a guy tries to buy a gun at a gun store and is denied. Well it just so happens that there's a big gun show every weekend at the Outlet mall he can just drop in to that ""gun store"" (effectively, let's be honest) and buy anything he wants to. How are any of the sellers to know if this person has a criminal past?  It's not about having a 100% prophylactic effect on crime, it's about adding another layer. No, it won't prevent all criminals from getting to guns. While the lock on your front door won't keep burglars out, I bet you lock it anyway."
Colorado,2v8xg8,satanisativa,7,Wed Feb 11 06:14:35 2015 UTC,"He can buy ""anything"" that is for sale by a private party. Gun shows weren't some ""background check free zone"". FFLs still needed to conduct background checks. Just because of the venue it doesn't change anything, he could go on the internet and find someone in state selling what he wants. And really, if he doesn't commit a crime with it, what's it matter? Doing something illegal with a firearm is still illegal. Drugs being illegal sure doesn't stop people from buying drugs. I don't think it's right that unpaid parking tickets prevent you from buying a firearm, do you?   Locking my front door is about effort. That doesn't apply to killing someone. If someone wants to kill somebody else, they're going to do it whether they bought a gun from a store or from a guy looking to get his money back on a gun he doesn't want anymore. Some guy isn't going to go, ""Wow, I bought a gun without a background check, I'm going to get away with murder!"" In the end it's not preventing crime, it's making more criminals out of citizens.   I could even make a case that a gun dealer doesn't give a fuck if the guy who just passed a background check is asking where the nearest school is, because that piece of paper absolves them from liability. But the guy dealing with an antsy-sounding dude who wants to meet in an abandoned part of town is going to consider if he wants to sell or not."

So if you wake up to people breaking into your house in the dead of night, you're limited to (statistically) about 3 hits hopefully being enough to stop them.   Given:   the frequency in which it is necessary to defend a house from determined invaders (what about 1/1000 the chance of being hit by a tornado?).  I hear gunowners say that most gun-crime is caused by ""those other people"" - referring to blacks in the city.   If most of this crime is some other place, I really don't see where all the fear is coming from.   I've worked in downtown Detroit for years - and never once had a problem with violence.  And in spite of all the people I know that keep guns to ward off zombies or home invaders - none of us actually know anyone that has ever had their home invaded. the benefits of not firing 20 rounds into neighboring homes, apartment units, etc.   I personally, would prefer my neighbors not fire at what they can't hit.  I don't want my son killed because a neighbor heard a sound, only to discover later that it was their daughter climbing into the house through a bedroom window.  That Colorado Springs ""home invasion"" resulted in an army officer killing his daughter.   FYI, I say that as someone with a large-capacity magazine that's grandfathered in.

Colorado,2v8xg8,drakinor1,3,Mon Feb 9 17:34:16 2015 UTC,"I'm curious as to how you would answer those questions yourself.  How could you possibly make them enforceable?  What limits would you put in place?  What sort of flexibility do you see as possible.  I want to engage with you in a real dialogue here, I'm not trying to bait you or be an asshole.  It's my opinion that the only law that should limit magazine size is the Square-Cube Law, so I'd like to hear your (seemingly more restrictive) opinion on the matter."
Colorado,2v8xg8,OscarZetaAcosta,-2,Mon Feb 9 03:58:06 2015 UTC,"For enforceability, it seems to me the easiest route is just to have people register what they have.  That becomes grandfathered in.  Then later on, if they're found to have something they didn't register later they face a very substantial fine.     This involves a little paperwork, doesn't instantly catch everyone that breaks the law.  But if someone does get stopped & checked out they could end up with a huge penalty - say, $10,000 and gun loss if they are breaking the law.  For limits 5-7 rounds seems reasonable, but that's just a guess.  For flexibility, maybe the less lethal or likely to be used against humans,  the larger the number of rounds.   So, for .22 shorts, as many rounds as you'd like.  For .223, a different story."
Colorado,2v8xg8,multi-gunner,4,Mon Feb 9 05:14:46 2015 UTC,"Connecticut did  just that with guns and magazines.  As those articles showed, their registration estimates are in the single digits.  NY as well faces what can only be termed abject failure in the face of registration.  Gun owners know that EVERY gun/mag registration drive has lead to confiscations.  Literally every single one.  From the earliest ones that were reactions to the Soviet revolution to the UK's to Australia's to Canada's to California, Illinois, and New York's.  EVERY LAST ONE.  And most without fair market compensation.    If this was attempted in Colorado, there would be <3% compliance.  And I'm being generous there.  This is a fight that pro-gun folks will fight to the bitter end and beyond.  This is a hill we will die on, quite literally in many cases if need be.  Fines mean nothing.  Jail time means nothing.  And you still don't address how you'd actually enforce it.  It's not anti-liberty law makers who would go door to door checking compliance.  It's cops who have already, state-wide, refused to comply themselves, let alone risk their own lives to enforce a ban that they know will be deadly to enforce.  You also don't address how a ban would stop me from going to Wyoming to buy everything I want and driving back.  How much would it cost just to have a mandatory checkpoint on the I-25 crossing?  More than could ever be justified.  We learned that lesson during prohibition.  Heck, I flat out think you couldn't get it passed.  If you think I'm wrong, I'd love to hear where you think my oversight is.  Far better to be informed of my ignorance than continue in it.  Registrations also do absolutely nothing to stop crime and never cost what they say they will.  Canada's is the perfect example.  Their registration cost them $1B US and was only supposed to cost $2M.  It's impact on crime was non-existent.  5-7 round limits eliminate most handguns and a great many rifles and shotguns, including hundreds and hundreds that are specifically designed for home defense, self-defense, sport shooting and hunting.  That's about as far from reasonable as I can imagine, short of single-shot only guns.  .22 shorts are actually among hitmens' preferred calibers because their report is 36db and essentially pinball around inside the body.  Moreover, shot placement is always more important than caliber.  A perfect shot with a .22LR will drop an elk.  I know a guy who got shot in the leg with a .303 Brit while hunting and hiked out 1.5 miles.  A gun's caliber is not the most important factor when it comes to the lethality.  A question, and if you don't answer, I'll take no offense, would you be amenable to meeting up and discussing?  Maybe go to a range where I can show you why I say things like a magazine ban are ineffective and onerous restrictions on the rights of people who aren't the problem in the first place?"

Cite an article or police report, from 2015, where crime was thwarted because of a citizen with a gun.  Gun advocates are always claiming the ""good guy with a gun"" argument, but NEVER provide proof of this actually happening.  It's just thrown around as truth.  When and where does this happen?  Where's the /r/GunsAreCool of ""good guy with a gun""?   They are stalwart in their assertions that magazine capacity is correlated with homicide rate, despite decades of evidence to the contrary.   I've not actually heard this argument before.  Magazine bans are a wimpy response to gun violence, from weak-willed politicians representing pro-gun constituencies.  If we had any politicians that had integrity, if they really cared to curb gun violence we would start by banning handguns and see how that goes.  Arguing there's some kind of powerful left-wing lobby in the US out to strangle ""liberty"" through gun control is a pretty ludicrous claim.  The (actual) left in this country can't even get a party or even politicians elected to adequately represent workers in this government.   They ignore that the natural state of mankind is free, and argue that ""rights must be based on need"" rather than ""limitations to rights must be based on need.""   No, I'm pretty sure gun control advocates seek limitations on your ""right"" to possess an unlimited number of guns of any type.  We ""need"" those limitations because society has demonstrated that enough guns to arm an entire population of 300M+ people causes more violence than it's worth.   They completely ridicule the notion that an armed population possesses at least some power against any force, foreign or domestic, that would oppress it.   We make fun of you because it IS a totally ridiculous notion.    You're really going to band together with a few dozen people, in today's world, and fight back the US National Guard or the US Army?  Or some other nation's army that decides to invade?  Your AR-15 is definitely going to protect your home against a missile attack - just shoot down the jets with your rifle.  It's also the most effective weapon against tanks rolling through the side of your house.  And don't forget military satellites.  The AR-15 can shoot those down too, severely hampering logistics.  You'll totally win and restore freedom to everyone.  We'll all hail you as heroes for keeping your stash of guns safe, and resent the day we were so short-sighted to ban automatic weapons.  Sorry, I clearly don't understand how the military or combat works.  Please illuminate me on how your band of brothers are going to defend our liberty from a tyrannical state.  The only references I have to work with are when some rednecks don't want to pay taxes or want to move cattle wherever they want, and I don't think they were successful in pushing back tyranny.  Here are the argument tactics gun advocates use:   They downplay incidents of gun violence as ""isolated"" and ""lone wolf,"" and never substantiate or expose how exactly the statistics are misrepresented. They claim that other countries are so vastly different from the US, that there's no point in any comparison.  This is really convenient for the gun advocate, because if we start comparing ourselves with safer countries it's almost like gun control starts to make sense. They decide to ignore suicide as part of gun violence, even though we outpace other countries in gun-related suicide.  But again, it's just wrong to compare the US to other countries. They claim that hundreds of thousands of crimes are prevented on a daily basis because a ""good guy with a gun"" was around to stop some crime that was happening, but never produce any articles or statistics to back that up. They claim that automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines are just for fun and most people who own them don't go on to mass shootings.  Except for the ""lone wolf"" that legally obtained them with little problem, with no previous mental health issues, passed a background check, and then went on a shooting spree.   Also:   We're not racist, but we like to shoot at targets of black men at the gun range.  It's just a joke, c'mon.  Where is your sense of humor? It's not threatening if we're at the gun range shooting at pictures of politicians - that's just free speech.  And also a joke, c'mon. Gun ranges are totally safe, except when we allows kids to fire automatic weapons and they kill people.  The problem is not that we gave an automatic weapon that happened to be available, but that the child didn't grow up with enough gun training to properly fire it.  It's the parents that were completely irresponsible. Guns in the home are totally safe, except when the parents screw up and leave armed guns around.  You can't blame the abundance of guns in the home; those parents were just irresponsible. Open carry is totally a right.  If you're a white person. It's never the fault of having too many guns in the US.  The blame rests entirely with the individual (remember: who was an isolated, rare case).  And the individual who goes on to a mass shooting the next day is also isolated and rare.  And the one after that...   EDIT: formatting"

Or some other nation's army that decides to invade?   You act like the entire army is going to show up at your door step. In an invasion, who is to say just a few soldiers don't break into your house, rape your wife and kids, and then kill you all? Wouldn't you rather at least have a chance to defend yourself? This happened all the time in warfare, and it's not like the entire army gang raped one house of people per town/village. Entire genealogical lines have been altered from soldiers going from house to house, raping families during an invasion.  Also, I don't see many soldiers of the US invading their own countrymen's houses. They uphold an oath to protect us from threats both foreign and domestic. There is already a group called the Oath Keepers that swears to disobey any orders given to engage troops against American citizens. A situation like this would quickly degrade into civil war, with U.S. soldiers going rogue during their operations to sabotage the government troops. Remember that missle has to be fired by someone.

The independent clause gives the people the right to bear arms and literally every other use of the word people in the Amendments is explicitly referencing individual rights.  The Militia, as clarified by the Dick Act of 1910, is all able-bodied adults, and its position in the dependent clause makes it clear that the Militia depends on having widespread civilian firearm ownership- were the able-bodied populace prohibited arms how would they fulfill their role?  Moreover, the term well-regulated is used in this instance to mean ""in good order"" or ""practiced."""
Colorado,2v8xg8,skinsfan55,4,Tue Feb 10 02:54:22 2015 UTC,"I find it one of the most nebulous amendments actually. ""A well regulated militia"" as a qualifier makes the amendment subject to lots of debate.   A lot of this is simply due to people trying to apply the modern ideas on militias instead of what they were at the time of the drafting. In most civilized nations during that timeframe, most able bodied men were expected or even required to have a gun and be ready to fight if their governments called, it was part of being a citizen/landowner. In those days a militia was simply non career military men who had their own equipment and would fight alongside the regular military. I hear many people say ""Well the national guard is the militia"" and that simply isn't true as they are still professional military members.   http://www.thefreedictionary.com/militia  Here you can read all about militias and how the definition has changed over the years. The idea of having an organized and government run militia in the United States didn't come into play until 1903.

On one hand - the hand I support - it's a woman's choice to do what she wants with her body, and that includes terminating a pregnancy. On the other, however, there are people who believe that from conception onward that fetus is a human being, and terminating it is tantamount to murder. Given that, under a normal pregnancy, that fetus would develop into a full-blown human being, with all of the rights of one, it's not exactly a stretch to extend those rights to the developing fetus. So for those people it becomes a decision of whose rights are more important; the fetus's right to life, or the mother's right to do what she wants to her body. Those people believe that the right to life is more important than the woman's right to her body for nine months.  Again, I don't agree with them, I think an unborn fetus is a part of the mother's body up until the point it can survive outside the womb, but that doesn't mean their perspective is stupid, just that it's different."

Colorado,2uu61j,MarkyleMorris,3,Thu Feb 5 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"It will come back to haunt you when you're older.  I used to work in a job where people had to ""prove"" to me that they were common law married. The vast majority of them failed miserably at doing so, and the ones who were able to prove it definitely hated having to track down their deceased spouse's family members and make them fill out forms with questions like ""Did X and Y plan to get married? Why didn't they? Did they present themselves as husband and wife? How long did they live together?""  Most of the times, the spouse's family didn't return the forms. Benefits denied.  Sometimes they filled it out, but it was incomplete/unclear/didn't arrive in time/some other problem. Benefits denied.  Other times everyone fills out the forms correctly and they all agree that you were in a common law marriage, but the widow/widower couldn't provide enough other evidence to support the allegation.  Benefits denied.  How would you like being told you weren't really married and you aren't entitled to widow's benefits after you considered yourselves to be married for decades? Even if you are able to do it, it's not going to be enjoyable. Imagine that your wife just died and you have to spend a bunch of time tracking down documents, filling out paperwork, and hassling both your and her family to fill out paperwork for you to prove that you were indeed married. It's shitty, and it didn't make people very happy to have to do it, I can tell you that for sure.  The alternative to all that if you're legally married is sending one certified copy of the marriage certificate. Worst case scenario, you've lost it and you make one phone call to request a new one.   Spending $30 (or even $200 if it actually costs that much, which I highly doubt) now will save one of you a shit ton of headache down the road, and possibly a lot of money too."

Colorado,2unsbp,MrMallow,3,Wed Feb 4 05:20:32 2015 UTC,"It's made entirely too easy to get an exemption.   For example...Because of when one of my kids birthday falls and how much of a stickler our insurance was for not having two well child visits within a year, my son's 5 year old well child visit fell three weeks after kindergarten started and so his vaccinations weren't 'up to date' when he started kindergarten. When I explained this to the school, they handed me a philosophical exemption form, no questions, no follow up. Another parent later told me that they forgot vaccination records on enrollment day and were given the same form.  There are two ways I think this should have been handled differently. The first is a doctor's office policy change (which has since been implemented at our pediatrician's office) allowing for a no charge nurse visit for regular patients, at which vaccinations can be administered. The second is having the school nurse create a tickler file of cases like this to follow up and make sure the vaccinations were obtained and replace the philosophical objection form with vaccination records."

Which, 9 years later, nobody can treat and he permanently looks like he has measles or some other serious disease.  Before any government mandated vaccinations, they need a filtering system to figure out who is prone to adverse reactions.   Everyone is all up in your grill about getting your kids vaccinated, always for ""THE GREATER GOOD! YOU MONSTER!"" But when your kid has an adverse reaction, and you've fucked up their autoimmune system, and no doctor can fix it or give you answers, then everyone scatters. You're left feeling like shit because you can't fix your kid's problems - that you feel like you created for listening to everyone else tell you what to do.   So, this is why I hate the idea of people forcing vaccinations. They sure as hell aren't there to help when things go wrong.  I can only assume genetic testing would be the answer. Right now it's a roll of the dice and you hope you luck out. But yeah - if anyone is going to force me to give my kids vaccinations at this point, then they need to make assurances that they aren't going to cause adverse reactions.   I don't care how rare everyone says those adverse reactions are. Until you're the parent of a kid who can't recover from it, people shouting mandatory vaccinations can take my place and try and figure out what the fuck is going my with my kids' autoimmune system for the last 9 years. Good luck with that. Because all we get right now are shrugs from the medical community.  It's awful. I'd love for the mandatory vaccination crowd to take my place for a month.

I'd love for them to take my place at the kitchen table at dinner, sitting across from my son and notice the flare ups happen, and automatically start the medicine conversation and start fretting about what we're going to do next to try and help him, while also knowing that we've covered every possible option.   I also hope ""the system"" pays for the medical coverage for adverse reactions from mandatory vaccinations. Because right now, parents foot the bill. You can't sue pharma or the Dr's, because even though you're being forced into the decision, the risk is still on you as a parent. And when you have horrible insurance, it's financially crippling. So now, we've permanently screwed up our son AND we have to pay thousands of dollars to try and figure out how to fix him, and we can't!   Clearly, I have very strong feelings about people and their mandatory vaccination shouting. Everyone always thinks of Jenny McCarthy and the autism circlejerk. Nobody thinks about the people who really are permanently damaged and discarded to the side because nobody can help."
Colorado,2unsbp,FeastingFortCollins,3,Wed Feb 4 15:45:22 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry that happened to your family, what a terrible situation to find yourself in. I also think you don't qualify as the stereotypical person the general community is up in arms about, your son is clearly one of the people who can't get vaccinated for medical reasons. I think people in general understand that there are people who legitimately can't get vaccinated.  And anyone who would call you a horrible parent for not vaccinating your child is mistaken.  Prior to the reaction that your son had, what was your stance on vaccination? Did you feel uncomfortable about it, but that you had no choice and had to go through with it? Or was it only after it happened that you changed your mind?  Also, how did they determine it was the vaccine that caused his condition? If you don't mind my asking. I had cats when I was in college (obviously not on the same level as having this happen to a child) who had severe allergic reactions to the rabies vaccine, which we obviously had no idea would happen until they got their shots."
Colorado,2unsbp,eta_carinae_311,1 point,Wed Feb 4 16:09:36 2015 UTC,"See, that's the thing though. When my son was a newborn and we were getting ready for the vaccination visit, I didn't want to have him vaccinated. Something in me screamed that it wasn't the right choice.  But everyone pushed me into it. My pediatrician gave me the lecture, and social shaming like this sure as hell didn't help.   So, I caved. He got his full dose of scheduled vaccinations at 2 months old. And then his adverse reaction started when we got home. When I took him back to the Dr, their response? ""Oh, yeah. This is a common adverse reaction to the pertussis vaccination"" like it was no big deal.   It started to manifest in his skin at 6 months old. The Dr's kept telling me it would go away. He'd grow out of it. Every single god damn visit I'd ask about it, ask for help, ask for more opinions.   Nobody knows what to do with adverse reactions - how to treat them and how to make kids whole again.   When he was in Kindergarten he had the worst flare up ever. I took him back to the pediatrician. They brought ALL of the Dr's in the clinic into the room to figure something out while I sat there scream-sobbing for help. All they would do was prescribe steroids.   But then, we maxed out on steroids the morning my son woke up with his head and face swollen like a balloon. His eyes were swelled shut. I threw him into the back of the car not wanting to wait for an ambulance. I drove like a fucking bat out of hell to the ER. We haven't been able to take steroids since. And that's what moved us to National Jewish.   We've done allergy testing, food testing, blood testing, testing, testing and more testing. The closest diagnosis we got was erythema multiforme, which is essentially an adverse response to medicine. And the only thing that anyone can pin this to is the pertussis vaccination. Everyone is on the fence on whether it's minor or major. Doesn't matter though, because there's no cure either way. I always say, at least there would have been a treatment plan if he had pertussis instead of the vaccination.   Also, if you'd like to see what a vaccination injury looks like - this is when we took him to the Dr for the 1 millionth time and everyone just stood there telling me they don't know what to do for him.   Contrasted photo so you can see inflammation better: http://imgur.com/yctx8Gk  I feel guilt as heavy as the weight of the world every single day because I didn't listen to my gut, because I didn't stand up for what I thought was right for my kid, for being pushed into something that ultimately ruined my kids body.   Now he looks like a leper. I can't even bear to put myself in his shoes. It breaks my heart into a million pieces.   So no. I don't want mandatory vaccinations. I want genetic testing developed first to help protect those who end up in my sons shoes."

The asshole who did this was pretty much reprimanded by the scientific community, and you can bet he'll never conduct research for a respectable institution again. This guy is as scummy as you can get.  If it were the parents who were getting sick over their dumb decision, I wouldn't care, but they are needlessly putting their own children at risk. The worst part is that some children have legitimate reasons (bad immunological reactions) for not getting vaccinated and they are normally protected by heard immunity, but when vaccination levels dip down, we as a society lose that heard immunity and these kids are put at risk, through no fault of their own or their parents. Shit, you could still have the vaccine, and not be protected due to the vaccine eliciting a poor response and not creating enough anti-bodies.  This is why we shouldn't let the scientifically illiterate call the shots, most of them don't know how the immune system works or how immunizations work as a whole."

I'm not normally in favor of that sort of peer pressure, but in this case I'm OK with it. We have some kids in our school who have legitimate reasons for not being vaccinated, or, like in the case of one of mine, had to have her vaccinations spread out instead of stacked due to other medical issues."

So seniors and infants are now at risk under the new format, and it's riskier to give so many vaccines to infants.  And we caused this by the vaccination campaign.

Colorado,2unsbp,perspichaos,0,Wed Feb 4 03:24:12 2015 UTC,"They really are, aren't they.  The big reason is that anti-corporation crunches are significantly more anti-science than the gun lovers are.  Global warming has become a right-left issue, but it's really the only area of science where there's significant pushback from the right.  The crunchies are loaded with anti-scientific bullshit like widespread 'toxin sensitivities', anti-GMO pro-Organic(tm), and a widespread belief that technology only advances as a result of their tender, earth-loving, hands.  IME, the arguments against vaccines fall more closely in line with the cruchy-bullshit philosophy rather than the teabagger-bullshit philosophy.

Colorado,2upc1r,DougDante,18,Wed Feb 4 01:12:23 2015 UTC,"So the backstory is that during the ""bad old days,"" if a victim accused someone of rape, it would only ever become a police matter. She (or potentially he) would see her attacker every day, in class, while due process dragged on.  So the reform has been to let universities hold administrative (not criminal) hearings to determine whether the rape accusation has merit. If it does, the accused is removed from being near the victim while the criminal justice system determines guilt or innocence.  Problem is, there isn't a criminal case most of the time. If there's not enough evidence for police to charge the accused, he more or less stays in a Kafka-esque limbo where he's not allowed to continue his studies, but also, is never charged with a crime.  It's hardly an ideal solution for anyone. The issue of consent is almost by definition impossible to prove without neutral witnesses. And since an administrative hearing generally assumes the accuser is telling the truth, it certainly is the case that a false accusation can ruin a student's career without the case ever reaching a prosecutor, much less a jury.  Worse yet, CU-Boulder and other universities do have a bad habit of silencing or firing critics of their programs. Which, as some of my own academic feminist friends agree, is definitely not okay.  edit: Typo"

It allows the selective circumvention of judicial process for those in a more privileged class arbitrarily. Real crimes are de facto adjudicated without exposure to a justice process. Without being subject to public scrutiny, and decided by a handful of unaccountable regents or administrators, these things can become corrupted pretty quickly into something foreign to our concepts of due process or justice.   These things turn into shit shows sooner or later...rich scion quietly gets preferential treatment as a victim or forgiven perpetrator, football star gets help to be shielded from the law, son or daughter of a prominent donor gets to quietly leave the school at worst.   For the rest of us it's prison, baby.   These parallel 'legal' processes are the reason the theme of a blindfolded justice goddess exists.

Colorado,2un7q0,YorjYefferson,2,Tue Feb 3 21:29:17 2015 UTC,"I had an experience hiking that was literally breathtaking for me, hiking the Mill Lake trail; I found out about it reading a brochure listing some trails near Gunnison. From Gunny you travel east on 50, turn off at Parlin like you are going to Pitkin, but in Ohio City you turn left and take what becomes a narrow dirt road until you see a campground a few miles out, and park there. A number of trails either converge or start from here.  I remember walking through a bunch of rocks to get to the trail, then up not very far until you see a trail sign, which is where this one starts. I tried to find it on google earth after I did the hike (I could find the campground no problem, but id'ing the trail itself was harder), and it wasn't until that point that I realized the start of the trail is 10k elevation. The lake itself sits at about 11,400 I think, and I seriously debated a few times whether or not to continue or give up because my lungs felt like they were popping out of my chest. It was worth it by the end, though, as the lake sits just below what looks like a big slide area from centuries ago, leading right into the lake from what it looks like when you're standing right in front of it.   It's kind of a small lake but I loved my hike up there and there were some absolutely beautiful wildflowers along the way. It's a lot more forest than I would have assumed for being that high in elevation, most of the trail you can't really see much else except for a few clearings where you can see the peaks. I was really proud of myself when I did this and think it's a great trail that is definitely not too crowded."

Colorado,2upnsm,lucrat,2,Wed Feb 4 13:50:52 2015 UTC,"We've had to talk to her twice previously about noise, which the first time only lasted a couple of weeks before she was being loud again. Since the second time it's been ok, she's still a little noisy but not as bad. The smoking though, I know some people get really defensive about that kind of thing."
Colorado,2upnsm,kyle1221,3,Wed Feb 4 15:39:24 2015 UTC,"Well, with no laws on your side and an apparently incompetent HOA, it looks like it's your only real option besides moving. Just be civil and honest, and thoroughly explain the issue. Perhaps go buy some e-cigs that closest resemble her cigarette brand, to see if she'll acquiesce to trying them."
Colorado,2upnsm,CanisImperium,2,Wed Feb 4 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"The only thing I found was in the HOA laws and regulations ""Noise and Odor. No sound or odor shall be emitted from any property within the ******* **** area which is noxious or unreasonably offensive to others, to include, but not limited to, animal waste and noise (INCLUDING LOUD MUSIC)."" The problem would be getting any support in trying to enforce it. Was trying to find anything to know what our rights might be in a situation like this, But any legal proceedings would be a last resort."
