AmazonTopRated,3e024y,PriceZombie,3,Mon Jul 20 22:33:51 2015 UTC,"4k is really really nice for everything looking crisp.  And for those with ok to decent graphics cards, remember if you can't do 4k in gaming, it will scale perfectly, as each single 1080 pixel just takes up 4 on a 4k monitor.   Supposedly this is IPS. Good color, good viewing angle.  This is a decent investment if you're in the market for higher res content.  I have a 2560x1440, so I feel I can hold off a little while, but if you're just running 1920x1080 and feeling an itch, this seems like a good move. (I use one of these at work.)"

Whichever comes first.  I also might hold off if any good 5120x2880 displays come into play, as I would enjoy editing 4k content. (like how with a 2560x1440 you can always edit 1080 content and still have room for menus around it.)"

Newegg had a 4k IPS, 32'' for 400$ (ish) this last cybermonday, but I missed it by a few minutes. :/  I got my 1440p for the same reason, essentially, while coding the extra menus and hotbars are always crowing my text area, having the bigger screen I can see everrrything.  If HMD (such as oculus rift) up their resolution sufficiently, I may skip the 4k/5k. Using an HMD you get infinite size desktops. ;)"
