Cardinals,3e436r,readermom,3,Tue Jul 21 21:15:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, in coach's pitch you pitch to your own team so you want to pitch perfectly to them so they can hit it.  So if you look at it that way, he did a fantastic job!"
Cardinals,3e436r,12in15,16,Tue Jul 21 23:59:32 2015 UTC,Can't believe the opposing coach didn't take him up on the offer to pitch to both teams.  At least once through the lineup.  Think it would be a cool experience for the kids to say they batted against an elite mlb pitcher.

Cardinals,3e3b6e,belgarion90,10,Tue Jul 21 17:32:13 2015 UTC,This will be good for Pham.  Back to AAA with a taste of the big leagues.  Hopefully he can make some adjustments and turn himself into a solid major leaguer.
Cardinals,3e3b6e,iamadacheat,13,Tue Jul 21 17:22:24 2015 UTC,"I'm disappointed it wasn't Kozma, but here's why it happened.   Right now nothing has really changed for our team. Kelly wasn't really going to get playing time with us unless there were a ton of injuries. Piscotty can come up and we can see if he's better than the abysmal 1B play we've had all season. If for some reason he isn't, he goes back down, our team is essentially the same. And we still have Pete. This will probably last at least until the trade deadline, where we reevaluate what we have and see if we need to make a move. I can't see Kozma lasting beyond that."
Cardinals,3e3b6e,helpimnaked,-16,Tue Jul 21 17:36:06 2015 UTC,I think Pete has been OK coming off the bench and spot starting at SS and 2nd. Why are you so down on him? He is great insurance/motivation for Peralta and Wong too.
Cardinals,3e3b6e,Luggage-12345,26,Tue Jul 21 17:46:40 2015 UTC,I think Pete has been OK coming off the bench   lol
Cardinals,3e3b6e,flipsideshooze,15,Tue Jul 21 18:07:15 2015 UTC,Don't know if that part was funnier or Wong/Peralta are worried about losing their starting spots to him.
Cardinals,3e3b6e,mlasn,20,Tue Jul 21 18:40:22 2015 UTC,Because he is an absolutely terrible batter and our bench is already stressed. His defense is great but that's not what we need right now.   He isn't a major league quality player and I wouldn't be surprised if he cleared waivers.
Cardinals,3e3b6e,helpimnaked,3,Tue Jul 21 17:50:04 2015 UTC,"He was DFA'd during last season, if I remember correctly, and cleared waivers."

Cardinals,3e3b6e,rabbiccu,10,Tue Jul 21 20:23:20 2015 UTC,Kozma is literally the worst batter in MLB (wOBA and wRC+ both have him 384th out of 384 for all players with at least 80 PA.) He's lost us half a win by just existing.
Cardinals,3e3b6e,thatoneguy211,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:34 2015 UTC,"I hate his offensive stats but his defense is good enough to be on the roster, and if you think you know more than the best GM in baseball you're loco!"
Cardinals,3e3b6e,Luggage-12345,2,Tue Jul 21 23:19:32 2015 UTC,"I would only agree with that statement if the Cardinals really needed a defensive middle infielder replacement, but they don't.  Their entire infield is above average defensively, with Reynolds being maybe a slight exception."
Cardinals,3e3b6e,dquizzle,15,Tue Jul 21 23:31:53 2015 UTC,"He is hitting .153, how is that OK? Half of our pitchers have better averages and two others are right below him."
Cardinals,3e3b6e,mlasn,-7,Tue Jul 21 17:50:27 2015 UTC,"Kozma is fucking terrible. There is no way he's just having an Utley/Schumaker start to his year. He has no redeeming qualities, definitely hasn't won a couple of games with pinch running. He deserves to have his dick cut off and feed to his butt buddy Matheny, the most incompetent manager in the Cardinals history.  Hey guys, am I kneejerking right?"
Cardinals,3e3b6e,makagulfazel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:36 2015 UTC,I understand having issues with Kozma but your full of shit if you think Mike can't manage a game.
Cardinals,3e3b6e,Luggage-12345,3,Tue Jul 21 23:17:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm in the same boat. I think Kozma has he uses, but I understand the hate. But the armchair baseball GMs that keep jumping on the management because they won't DFA him need to take a chill pill. There's seems to be a bunch of people in panic mode because of the two games at PNC and the 18 inning game with the Mets; it's baseball, guys. Save the harsh criticism for when the Cardinals don't have the best record in baseball.  r/cardinals is pretty good in general, but I want to strangle people on Twitter each time a lineup card is released."
Cardinals,3e3b6e,makagulfazel,0,Tue Jul 21 23:22:42 2015 UTC,No I'd say most of this is actually pretty damn accurate

I'm excited to see some plate appearances out of him. I don't expect any starts any time soon, but I'm definitely hyped for this kid.  Edit: I suck"
Cardinals,3e3b6e,JhonnyWongStockings,4,Tue Jul 21 17:36:08 2015 UTC,I don't expect any starts any time soon   I guarantee he gets at least one start at CHW. He can play multiple positions or DH.
Cardinals,3e3b6e,hutat,4,Tue Jul 21 17:44:37 2015 UTC,"Oh he'll start right away. Mo said yesterday they are shooting for four starts a week, and the first base job is his to lose unless we make a trade. I'm sure he'll be at first tonight."

Cardinals,3e3b6e,CaptAmerica42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:35:17 2015 UTC,"This means a bit more playing time for Bourjos, though probably not much. At this point, Bourjos becomes the only backup CF on the roster, with Heyward available in a pinch. Mom's Piscotty can cover either corner spot though he has little experience in left. He also has played CF, but I doubt he'd be used there much, if at all."

I've heard of people buying fleet/rental cars because that's one way to get all of that stripped. They buy in bulk so they can throw their weight around.

But for an organization to be making some kind of hero out of a guy that checked out and took someone with him is just in poor fucking taste.

Well these Oscar comments are still great."
Cardinals,3e1ylw,letuotter,4,Tue Jul 21 10:49:15 2015 UTC,"I mean, it is a weird line with Oscar. It was a tragedy and you have to feel for his family and her family and Carlos Martinez, who was his best friend.   But he was driving drunk and he did take another life and yes he was young and yes he was good at baseball, but if he wasn't that last thing, we wouldn't be holding him up on a pedestal.  He drove drunk. He endangered other people by getting behind that wheel. He died and so did his girlfriend. It's hard to defend that kind of behavior."

Cardinals,3e2u4l,AuburnAviator13,8,Tue Jul 21 15:06:55 2015 UTC,StubHub is the best place I found. If you want to take your chances you can always go to the box office the morning of and see if they have any unsold tickets and they will give to the military. They do that periodically. I've had coworkers and haven't had any problems getting tickets thatway. You should be able to get a Hayward Jersey at the team store in the stadium or really any team store and any local shopping mall.
Cardinals,3e2u4l,BetterThanAFoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:51:59 2015 UTC,"As a fellow Alabamian, I second the StubHub suggestion. Last year we got last minute tickets (2 hours before the game) for $50/seat in the 2nd row of the Home Field Box directly behind home plate. It was sweet. Not common (they run $150ish on average I think), but still - check it daily. You might get lucky. I just got back from a visit there this weekend, snagged awesome seats again thanks to StubHub. You have to print your tickets though, they won't scan phones.    If you haven't been to the stadium before, I don't recommend sitting in right field this time of year because the sun shines on those seats for a long ass time. Everywhere else is pretty dope though."
Cardinals,3e2u4l,Hotnonsense,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:18 2015 UTC,We try to alternate going to STL and ATL each year for at least one game a year and went last year. We got tickets via stub hub and paid about 100 per for mid level behind home plate seats. Looks like thats going to be the best option again. Luckly we we cant make the ATL series this year so its Busch 2 years in a row!

Cardinals,3dyw93,kuhanluke,4,Mon Jul 20 23:02:02 2015 UTC,"The thing that really sucks about this is it seems as though the Cards are going to make a determination about whether or not to trade for a front line 1B on a two week sample size in the majors.  I really really hope he does well, but say he comes out like a shot, he may cool considerably after the trade deadline, thus making the acquisition of another option through external means that much more difficult."
Cardinals,3dyw93,zigmus64,4,Mon Jul 20 23:20:26 2015 UTC,"Well Reynolds has actually been a slightly positive-WAR player this year. I'd rather see the team give Piscotty a chance and they can always fall back with Reynolds. If they go out and get a top-line 1B I'm afraid it'd cost too much when we don't really need the upgrade. Hopefully Adams comes back next year and produces and we can get by this year with an average first baseman and not move some prospects for a 4 month upgrade. If the right deal comes up I'd take it, but this team is set up to make a run for the next 3+ years and I'd hate to cut into that future potential just to have a little more at 1B this year. The playoffs are fluky and often come down to timely hitting and pitching. You want to make the playoffs as many times as possible and give yourself a shot at making a run and I'd hate to see the cards sacrifice potential future playoff appearances for a slightly better shot at a world series this year. But I'm probably in the minority. I'm a white sox and cardinals fan. I've seen the cardinals do everything right and give themselves a shot every year, and I've seen the sox do most things wrong and give themselves a shot every third year with a higher payroll. I think the key is building a team that could contend every year and not going all out any year because crazy stuff happens in October. Put yourself in contention and maybe that crazy stuff happens for your team."
Cardinals,3dyw93,cardsfan1343,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:06:50 2015 UTC,"Slightly positive according to FanGraphs, slightly negative according to bbref, and either way that makes him at Best a replacement-level player an absolutely should not be the starting first baseman for a playoff team."

Cardinals,3dyw93,scottzee,4,Mon Jul 20 18:15:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, he's mainly a doubles hitter, but he's already hit a career high number of home runs (11) this season. He's not going to be Albert Pujols, but he's always been a solid contact hitter and has added more power this year."
Cardinals,3dyw93,sparty09,3,Mon Jul 20 19:02:33 2015 UTC,Tweaked his swing for more pop past offseason.
Cardinals,3dyw93,meowmeowtits,2,Mon Jul 20 19:14:08 2015 UTC,My guess is that he'll play 1B part time until our OF isn't so crowded. Holliday is 35 and his contract is up after next year (team option for '17) so Piscotty could play 1B until Holliday leaves.
Cardinals,3dyw93,amarner32,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:49 2015 UTC,"so Piscotty could play 1B until Holliday leaves.   They're almost guaranteed to pick up Holliday's $17m 2017 option unless he absolutely tanks next year, and then there's the whole ""we still have Matt Adams on the team"" thing. There's no way they leave Piscotty in the majors getting spot time at 1B for two+ years."
Cardinals,3dyw93,thatoneguy211,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:35:06 2015 UTC,"Adams' contract is up after this season. Also, he wasn't exactly killing it when he went down with injury (.281 OBP). It's possible he won't play for the Cardinals again. Last I heard, he could come back around the start of the postseason but you never know.  Say Adams doesn't come back next season. Piscotty could play there for a couple years and move to the OF when Holliday is done.  This is, of course, all speculation. I have no idea what they have in mind with Piscotty."
Cardinals,3dyw93,amarner32,3,Tue Jul 21 01:25:30 2015 UTC,There's no way we let Adams go in his first year of arbitration
Cardinals,3dyw93,Pashto96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:50:58 2015 UTC,Adams was on pace for career lows in HR's and RBI's this season. He had 4 HR's in the first two months of the season. Not exactly destroying the ball. I think he'll be back next year but it's not out of the question.
Cardinals,3dyw93,amarner32,2,Tue Jul 21 03:33:21 2015 UTC,He had a slow start to the season and got injured. This team desperately needs power and he can provide it. He'll be worth the million or so we pay him
Cardinals,3dyw93,Pashto96,2,Tue Jul 21 04:24:54 2015 UTC,I hope he comes back next season and rips the cover off the ball. Hopefully this discussion ends up being moot.
Cardinals,3dyw93,amarner32,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:55:05 2015 UTC,"If he's healthy and not obviously terrible, I think he's in a cardinals uniform at spring training. But he's competing for a spot. I hope we don't make a dumb move for an upgrade because Adams has such obvious potential to be a 2-4 WAR player and Scruggs and Piscotty (assuming he stays at 1B) have potential as well. We have the guys for first base, they're just a year from being healthy/ready. If we pay somebody now we will have to give up prospects for the 4 month upgrade, and I'm not OK with that. If we try and sign a guy for longer than 4 months, we give up the healthy competition for the position I mentioned earlier and I don't like that either. Our team is fine. Our most obvious hole is 1B and even then Reynolds is a slightly positive-WAR player. There is no need to sell off prospects for a slight upgrade. Our depth has brought us this far, lets keep it and ride it for the next few years. I'd be happier if we slightly upgraded the bullpen than if we upgraded at 1B."

If the goal is to improve the team this season, hopefully en route to a championship this season, we can't be worried about whether or not Matt Adams is our first baseman next season."
Cardinals,3e0kgp,J3D1,14,Tue Jul 21 01:00:09 2015 UTC,Adams isn't a legit first baseman we should move on

Jason Heyward went through a similar slump at the beginning of the season, and now he's hitting .287, .312 since the start of May. Matt just went through a really rough May. He hit .304 in April."
Cardinals,3e0kgp,amarner32,3,Tue Jul 21 05:46:44 2015 UTC,"And Matt Carpenter isn't a legit third baseman, we should move on from him, too? Slumps fucking happen, it's baseball.   You can't seriously be comparing Carpenter to Adams. Carpenter is in a huge slump and still has an OBP of .361 on the season. Adams was below .300 by a considerable margin when he went down. OBP isn't everything but it's ridiculous to compare Carpenter's slump to Adams'."
Cardinals,3e0kgp,JacobMHS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Matt Adams isn't as good a player as Matt Carpenter. But he's a pretty good first baseman. You may want your first baseman to have more power, but last year was his first full year as a first baseman."
Cardinals,3e0kgp,LukeSperk,2,Tue Jul 21 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think the right thing for this season is to not worry about blocking Adams, but saying we just move on from him in general is way too reactionary. He has shown he is a capable first baseman in the past."
Cardinals,3e0kgp,sgtshootsalot,3,Tue Jul 21 06:21:53 2015 UTC,He also was starting a hot streak when he went down. He had 3 straight games with a double.
Cardinals,3e0kgp,crackalac,4,Tue Jul 21 12:34:01 2015 UTC,Or this could be just a public bluff by Mo.
Cardinals,3e0kgp,Davidfreeze,3,Tue Jul 21 04:14:08 2015 UTC,"No it's always a good idea to seem desperate in negotiations. ""Matt Adams sucks we need a first basemen bad."" Seems like a great thing to spread around when checking out the trade market"
Cardinals,3e0kgp,bunk,2,Tue Jul 21 12:47:49 2015 UTC,If Mo's comment isn't a negotiation tactic it is highly delusional.
Cardinals,3e0kgp,helpimnaked,3,Tue Jul 21 08:00:59 2015 UTC,"It's all political talk. We're in the trade market. Mo doesn't want to outright say we need a starting first basemen for this year and beyond. He's looking at all his options. If Adams for some reason ends up being our starter next year, he doesn't want to have comments out there about how we are looking to replace him."
Cardinals,3e0kgp,Hxcfrog090,2,Tue Jul 21 13:08:04 2015 UTC,Mo doesn't want to block him....so then why not trade him?
Cardinals,3e0kgp,Ihateunerds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:13:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised at all if he is part of a trade package for a 1B.  The guy saying he has no trade value is overreacting, Adams still has three years of team control left. He's far from worthless to a team that is rebuilding and looking to move a veteran first baseman.  But he won't be the main piece - we're gonna have to give up one of our top pitching prospects too like a Gonzales or Reyes or Kaminsky."
Cardinals,3e0kgp,Hxcfrog090,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:22 2015 UTC,I'm perfectly okay with trading one of our pitching prospects if it means us landing something like Prince Fielder.
Cardinals,3e0kgp,Ihateunerds,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:00 2015 UTC,"Well there's no way we're going after somebody like that with an albatross of a contract, but I'd do say Kaminsky or Gonzalez plus Adams for a Lind or Encarnacion."

Cardinals,3e0kgp,burts_beads,2,Tue Jul 21 18:09:35 2015 UTC,Because he has no real value right now?
Cardinals,3e0kgp,Hxcfrog090,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:57 2015 UTC,"I get that, I'm not saying trade him at the moment. But I don't understand having such a huge raging boner for someone that you want to wager your entire organizations success to see this one guy play. If you can get better by putting someone else at first, why wouldn't you do that? Mo has said he won't make a trade for a first baseman because he doesn't want to block Adams. Which basically means first base is going to be a weak spot the rest of the year unless Piscotty pans out, or Reynolds starts producing."
Cardinals,3e0kgp,burts_beads,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:31 2015 UTC,"I doubt Adams is the right guy to plan on being at first base in the future, I'm not arguing that. But there's little point in shipping him off right away when we likely get nothing of value in return because we'd be selling low. What's the point when he's not an expensive player?"
Cardinals,3e0kgp,Hxcfrog090,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:33 2015 UTC,If you're going to get a substantial upgrade its going to cost a lot anyways. We're still going to have to trade a top prospect.
Cardinals,3e0kgp,reskk,5,Tue Jul 21 16:58:37 2015 UTC,"Adams showed no signs of promise this season, the future is elsewhere."
Cardinals,3e0kgp,sgtshootsalot,4,Tue Jul 21 06:36:15 2015 UTC,"In the 3 games Before he went down, he was 7 for 12 with three doubles. He was finding his swing it seemed. He was just starting to get hot."
Cardinals,3e0kgp,amarner32,5,Tue Jul 21 12:35:28 2015 UTC,"To play devil's advocate, those three games were the exception to the rule. He had a .281 OBP when he went down and had just as many K's as he did hits."
Cardinals,3e0kgp,reskk,2,Tue Jul 21 14:34:25 2015 UTC,"Yes he was on a hot streak, yet he earlier in the season had something like an 2-38 streak. His body will not age well either, and will cause him to be more injury prone than someone with a ""healthy"" body.  Adams is nothing more than a short term possibility at first base or a bench bat."
Cardinals,3e0kgp,meowmeowtits,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:50 2015 UTC,I literally believe nothing Mo says when it comes to injuries and trades.  The guy has a business front at all times when it comes to this type of stuff. He knows what he is saying and what it means to other GMs.

Cardinals,3dze02,psychedellosaurus,6,Tue Jul 21 14:09:49 2015 UTC,"I feel he is also someone who puts team first. If he had some illness that the team was hiding, what would be the point? If Carp, Mo, Matheny all knew he was dealing with a major illness they'd come out and make it known and let him have a year off or retire depending on the type.  The fact he is grinding things out shows me its something he can overcome. My guess he had to adjust his routine drastically so he didn't wear himself out. Mess with someone's routine, that will definitely affect performance.  This just happens to be affecting it greatly."
Cardinals,3dze02,meowmeowtits,3,Mon Jul 20 20:14:26 2015 UTC,"Replace Carp with Allen Craig. Everyone said the EXACT same things about him. And they were all wrong. Seems kind of naive to think the exact same thing about a different player when we just got a reality check last year.  I'm by no means suggesting Carp is done, just that I'm concerned about underlying issues that could play out similarly."
Cardinals,3dze02,meowmeowtits,5,Mon Jul 20 20:19:13 2015 UTC,"You could point to a single play with Craig where he was injured and lots of people questioned whether he'd fully recovered when he refused surgery.   With Carp, there is no injury. If he has an illness that requires treatment, what would stop him from getting actual treatment? It makes no sense to try and fight that. If he has some career ending illness, he doesn't strike me as a guy to fight his health, hurt the team, just to squeeze out one last year.  There is a difference in trying to play through an injury than trying to play through a serious sickness, its not just a flu he would be trying to hide."
Cardinals,3dze02,kuhanluke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:36:49 2015 UTC,"Well, my point was that Mono takes months to recover fully from (sometimes). And his symptoms of extreme fatigue and dizziness are indicators of that illness. There's also no treatment. And, as others have said, it's not like we have a star 3B waiting to come up so they wouldn't sit him for the months it take to recover. Better to just play poorly and get paid than go on 60 day DL for an illness like Mono."
Cardinals,3dze02,AnonymousJobber,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:39:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, Piscotty could've been spending time at 3B, where he was originally, instead of at 1B."

Cardinals,3dze02,lotusfox,3,Mon Jul 20 21:12:36 2015 UTC,"I really don't think its that simple.  I think that you are trying to compare apples to oranges.  Carp's numbers and so called decline might be concerning, but comparing them to an injured Craig, is like comparing a starting pitcher's numbers to a reliever's numbers. Sure, as numbers they are something to worry about, but once you apply context, the numbers aren't related whatsoever.  Have you thought it might be a slump, I know down below you talk that a slump doesn't last this long, but it can and it has.  Albert had one.  Scott Rolen did too.  Slumps can very easily last 2+ months, especially when a player is moved around the order to try to find a place that is a better fit for him.    It also might be mental, with the injuries the Cardinals have dealt with, Carp might be telling himself that he has to do more, but that's actually having the reverse effect on him and screwing with his head, again something that is very common and would also cause 'extreme fatigue'.   I guess my point, is why look for some underlying issue to justify his performance?  He's a Pro, he will get out of the funk."
Cardinals,3dze02,cloud9ineteen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:01:57 2015 UTC,"I guess my point, is why look for some underlying issue to justify his performance? He's a Pro, he will get out of the funk.   And I guess my point is ignoring the possibility that something else was wrong seems silly. How often do players miss a half-dozen games early in the season because of ""fatigue""?   Sure, it's possible he's in a huge slump and he might recover tomorrow. I'm just pointing out the correlation between his ""slump"" and his ""extreme fatigue"" situation. It makes me wonder if something else was at play besides simply being tired."
Cardinals,3dze02,jmikesyo,3,Mon Jul 20 21:06:34 2015 UTC,"Carps' problem started when he took a pitch to the bicep. You can see it in the numbers. I think he has recovered from that but a player with as much desire and drive as Marp has can get a little too intense with themselves when they are doing poorly. If he is less hard on himself he will get it back, but I don't know how he eases up. I do love the guy."
Cardinals,3dze02,iamadacheat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:28 2015 UTC,"that's what i thought.  he took a hard pitch right on his elbow or just above it.  and as soon as i saw it happen, i thought to myself, ""that could really hurt him at the plate!  who knows how much damage that pitch just did!""  and then he started slumping.  i was thinking it would take him a week or two to recover, but not this long.  of course, i don't even know if that HBP is really the cause. i'm just a fan."
Cardinals,3dze02,WillieStroker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:00 2015 UTC,Kershaw got to him I guess.
Cardinals,3dze02,kuhanluke,2,Tue Jul 21 01:04:38 2015 UTC,"Mental fatigue is my best (unprofessional) assumption.  Plus he got taken out of the lead off spot, that was his job and maybe he believes Mike lost faith in him.  I am a firm believer of mental strength being the most important strength in hitting."
Cardinals,3dze02,kuhanluke,2,Mon Jul 20 20:19:08 2015 UTC,He got taken out of the lead off spot because he was hitting so well and with so much power that it was a waste to have him bat with the bases empty so often.
Cardinals,3dze02,kuhanluke,2,Mon Jul 20 20:40:42 2015 UTC,"I completely agree about the mental thing, I just find it uncommon for ""mental slumps"" to continue on this long. Especially on a team that is winning.  It should also be noted he had 18 strikeouts for a .167 KO rate before and 55 strikeouts for a .266 KO rate afterwards.  That's a huge increase for someone who was touted last year as arguably the best ball/strike eye in the game."
Cardinals,3dze02,iamadacheat,3,Mon Jul 20 20:28:57 2015 UTC,I feel like his slump also correlates to Matheny moving him from the lead off spot. I know his most recent HR came from the lead off spot against the Pirates and his approach just feels much more locked in. I would love to see those numbers run.
Cardinals,3dze02,WillieStroker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:21:34 2015 UTC,"He was moved on April 28th so the numbers reflect that date, I did not filter specifically for 1 or 2 position but baseball reference makes it clear he was moved on the 28th (ie: pinch hitting and the few 1 starts after April 28th are included in the after number). He went 2-12 in the three games he started at the 1 in July, with 1 being the HR you mentioned.  It should also be noted that there is only a 1.5 week difference between when he moved to his ""injury"" so the numbers are necessarily going to be very similar.

There is very little reason to believe that moving Carpenter to the number two spot turned him into a different hitter.  It's a mere coincidence that just two weeks after being moved to the two spot he had that extreme fatigue incident.  He clearly hasn't been the same since those three days off.
Cardinals,3dze02,Stephen_Piscotty,2,Mon Jul 20 21:53:59 2015 UTC,"He's hitting differently, and getting unlucky.   Carp batting 1st:  22.7% LD, 12% K, .366 BABIP, 41.3% hard hit, .438 wOBA  Carp batting 2nd  33.3% LD, 22% K, .280 BABIP, 29.6% hard hit, .308 wOBA  Obviously getting at least somewhat unlucky to have your LD% skyrocket and BABIP plummet, but the Ks I believe are a product of him thinking he has to hit more. Everyone kept saying he's hitting so well move him somewhere to produce runs, and now he feels like he has to (Even though driving in and being driven in are the same)  Carp needs a break, maybe. Maybe he needs more days off than he's gotten, but he also needs to be batting leadoff. He's getting unlucky and will rebound a bit, but the Ks need to drop and the power needs to rise, and changing his plate approach seems to have fucked him over hard."
Cardinals,3dze02,Stephen_Piscotty,2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:56 2015 UTC,What's LD?
Cardinals,3dze02,bmac92,2,Tue Jul 21 02:10:40 2015 UTC,Line drives. Best batted ball type for babip

Cardinals,3dze02,psychedellosaurus,2,Tue Jul 21 03:18:07 2015 UTC,"this confirms my observations  that said, i have been thinking about mono lately"
Cardinals,3e03ye,jopjor,7,Mon Jul 20 22:47:14 2015 UTC,"I'd rate this as highly unlikely, for one big reason: Toronto is in the middle of the most closely contested division in all of baseball - the AL East is basically up for grabs.  I confess I'm not super familiar with the Blue Jays' lineup, but I do know that Donaldson is having a career year, and José Bautista is very injury prone. I can't imagine they'd be willing to part with a big bat.  Anything could happen, and I like Encarnacion (though he's pretty streaky). But I think Toronto would expect a pretty significant package in return, and the team with the best record in baseball probably shouldn't give up so much so quickly."
Cardinals,3e03ye,Abyss_in_Motion,2,Tue Jul 21 00:12:10 2015 UTC,Mo said last week he didn't want to block Matt Adams at first next year
Cardinals,3e03ye,Swish98,11,Mon Jul 20 23:06:25 2015 UTC,"Kind of sad to hear.  I like Adams but really don't think he's good enough to warrant not looking at a 1B who could be here next year.  When I look at what it's going to take to get to the world series, Lind is perfect.  Sure he won't help our struggles vs LHP but he rakes against RHP.  Grienke, Cole, Burnett, Arrieta, Hammel, Scherzer, Zimmeman, Strasburg, all RHP and all pitchers we might have to play against."
Cardinals,3e03ye,wh11,4,Tue Jul 21 00:11:00 2015 UTC,I think he's just being political in case we are forced to roll with Adams next year.   Sticking with Adams when we could improve would be a terrible and very un-Mo-like call.
Cardinals,3e03ye,CatzonVinyl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"Eh, that sounds like posturing to me. ""We want a temporary fix"" means that teams might be willing to take less for a longer-term first baseman, because Mo implied that he'd flip him in the offseason anyway."
Cardinals,3e03ye,kuhanluke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:08:45 2015 UTC,"Right. But Encarnacion still makes sense because you have the option. I understand not wanting to block Adams, but he's struggled against LHP his whole career and has declined overall too. If Encarnacion comes in and bashes lefties or just generally has a great second half, I think it would be pretty foolish to decline his option just for the sake of not blocking Adams. And, on the other hand, if he shows you he's not the answer either, a $2 million buyout isn't going to cripple the franchise."
Cardinals,3e03ye,Fred_Fred_Burger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:33 2015 UTC,"The Jays arn't going to trade him unless we give up either Wacha or Martinez. They're in the middle of a division race, they have no reason to trade him unless we provide them with an immediate upgrade to their team."
Cardinals,3e03ye,Fred_Fred_Burger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:27:28 2015 UTC,"Reading what their GM is saying, it sure doesn't seem to me like they see it that way. Anthopolous says he wants young, team-controlled pitching and is willing to trade from his 25-man roster to get it. That doesn't seem like a team making a push for the playoffs this year. Which makes sense at 47-47 and 4.5 games out with two teams ahead of them, despite having likely overachieved this year."
Cardinals,3e03ye,crackalac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:45:53 2015 UTC,The Blue Jays have one of if not the best offense in baseball. They are pitching short of being a legitimate contender. They arnt going to give up one of their big bats for prospects. They'd want immediate rotation help. And I don't see us giving them that
Cardinals,3e03ye,Not_MyCabbages,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:41 2015 UTC,"As for Wacha and Martinez, I don't think there's any way the price tag is that high. Obviously, if it were, this conversation isn't worth having. But I don't see it."
Cardinals,3e03ye,Isuckatlife1266,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:50:03 2015 UTC,I feel like they would ask for more than that.
Cardinals,3e03ye,columbusplusone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:14:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of Encarnacion and I've brought this up several times in various threads here and in /r/baseball. The problem is that the Jays need players who can contribute right now, not prospects. Cooney, Lyons, and Gonzo all have major league experience but they're still really not much more than prospects at this point who could make a big difference for some team in the future but probably not have a big impact down the stretch this season. Garcia is obviously ready but with his contract up and him being so injury prone, he's in no way a dealbreaker for Toronto. Lynn and Martinez are untouchable, and that leaves Lackey as the biggest trade bait for an Encarnacion deal, since he would absolutely be able to contribute immediately, but, like Garcia, he is far from a dealbreaker. The only package I could see happening would be Lackey and Garcia, plus Reynolds since all three could contribute now and Reynolds could replace some of the lost offense from Encarnacion, but even then the Jays likely want a prospect out of that deal. So we throw in a guy like Gonzales or Cooney and take some average pitcher in the last year of their contract to balance it out, someone like R.A. Dickey. It looks like we're giving up a lot there, but then we have Dickey and either Gonzo or Cooney to fill out the rotation for the remainder of the year, plus a legit powered-up first baseman. Toronto gets solid pitching that we may not have kept beyond this season anyway and a power bat. Even then, this trade is pretty unlikely in reality because of the blockbuster feel to it, and Mozeliak tends to steer pretty well clear of those."
Cardinals,3e03ye,CatzonVinyl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:40:49 2015 UTC,"I think the disconnect in this conversation is what the Jays think of their own season. I've seen plenty of comments from their GM saying he wants team-controlled pitching assets and will trade from his current major-league roster to get them. That doesn't sound like a team pushing for this year. Think about it, we're not hearing them connected to Cueto or Price, guys who are rentals. This is why I think Lyons, Cooney and Gonzales would be perfect fits in a deal because they've got ML experience (at different amounts, obviously) but are all still at rookie levels, and therefore controllable long-term."

Cardinals,3dxnzi,Michael__Pemulis,7,Mon Jul 20 14:54:13 2015 UTC,Ryan was a much better defender though. He was easily one of the best shortstops since Ozzie.

I've been playing phone tag with her all day, though, because my phone keeps not ringing when she calls, and when I return her voicemail she doesn't answer... I finally left a message with my work number (and told my coworker that I'd applied to a few places, which I didn't want to do yet) so I've been waiting for her to call back for like three hours now. I really hope she calls back soon, the job would be perfect for me, and I'd love to get an interview."

Cardinals,3dxnzi,huanthewolfhound,3,Mon Jul 20 14:28:12 2015 UTC,Was it over his pitching or his lack of hustle in running to 1B? His pitching was fine by me.
Cardinals,3dxnzi,hail_satan666,6,Mon Jul 20 15:34:11 2015 UTC,But Matheny lost us the game because we couldn't get runs!   That's what they sound like.
Cardinals,3dxnzi,civilaiden,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:48:00 2015 UTC,"I understand giving Heyward some time off after he admitted to not feeling right the last few days. It seemed a little silly though to give Holliday and Carpenter a day off right before a day off.   Is the loss 100% Matheny's fault? No, the offense has always sucked. He didn't do us any favors putting in the WORST batter in the MLB(Kozma) and someone only marginally better(Pham)."
Cardinals,3dxnzi,iamadacheat,2,Mon Jul 20 16:23:30 2015 UTC,Holliday is easing back from injury.  Carpenter needs more time off to figure out his swing.  Edit: Pham was beasting in AAA.  He has fewer than 50 major league at bats.  He'll figure it out eventually.
Cardinals,3dxnzi,helpimnaked,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:01:40 2015 UTC,I think Pham's time may be done with Piscotty potentially joining the team tomorrow.
Cardinals,3dxnzi,iamadacheat,2,Mon Jul 20 17:57:01 2015 UTC,"That's probably best for his development too.  He's had a taste of the majors, and now he can go back to AAA with some things to work on and get at bats every day."

Cardinals,3dvzw2,sgtshootsalot,4,Mon Jul 20 00:22:42 2015 UTC,"Everyone's on rest. They'll probly skip Martinez spot on the rotation and go with wacha Tuesday and Lynn on normal rest, then Garcia than lackey than Martinez. It actually works out fine."
Cardinals,3dvzw2,bjsy92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:18:02 2015 UTC,"this was the whole reason I even opened my laptop, to try and figure out what the hell they were gonna do. It's actually good for Martinez since he threw less pitches than he would have in a start, and gets more days. They need to be careful with him."
Cardinals,3dvzw2,cloud9ineteen,0,Mon Jul 20 14:02:36 2015 UTC,He still pitched 70 more pitches than he had to with nothing to show for it. We could have not pitched him and skipped his next start to start saving his innings. Think incremental.
Cardinals,3dvzw2,NinjaChemist,10,Mon Jul 20 15:27:00 2015 UTC,"Just ridiculous.  Unexplainable.    I would love to see Matheny's response if asked the question, ""Why would you rest 3 of your top players right after the AllStar game and right before a day off?"""

Cardinals,3dvzw2,Ktullu,5,Mon Jul 20 00:13:00 2015 UTC,What the fuck was that. We should get medals for holding out fo 18 innings. Off to sleep!
Cardinals,3dvzw2,letuotter,18,Mon Jul 20 00:13:06 2015 UTC,"The team's success up to this point does not justify poor decisionmaking by the managing staff.  Runners on first and second with no outs and not requiring Reynolds to bunt is a signifier of a larger problem. If the managing staff doesn't consider it important to bunt in that situation—or in the case of last week versus Liriano when he was throwing nothing but balls and hitters were still swinging on the first pitch—then I don't have faith in them to make more important decisions.  It goes like this: if there are serious instances of mismanaging that fans can see, what kind of failures can we not see?"
Cardinals,3dvzw2,Goldstubble,14,Mon Jul 20 00:16:40 2015 UTC,oh and #firemabry
Cardinals,3dvzw2,koalabear78,2,Mon Jul 20 00:17:58 2015 UTC,"It goes like this: if there are serious instances of mismanaging that fans can see, what kind of failures can we not see?   Oh, go back to /r/conspiracy with that logic.  Mabry's a joke as a coach, that's about as deep as the rabbit hole goes."
Cardinals,3dvzw2,DrKedorkian,9,Mon Jul 20 00:19:18 2015 UTC,"Please don't attempt to trivialize my criticism by strawman hyperbole.   The point is not as you have misunderstood it to imply nefarious actions by the coaching staff. The point is this: There is faith in the coaching staff to give due diligence to their position and if that coaching staff is committing mistakes fans are able to perceive, how are they treating areas of their job that fans are not able to perceive?   So the question is ""How much effort has there actually been in improving the hitters' performance?""   Allowing Reynolds to hit instead of bunt is indicative of a hopeful rather than pragmatic mindset. Rather than acknowledging the troubles the hitting has faced and trying to produce the optimum situation in which Yadi could bat, Matheny et al. knowingly played their poor chances and were bitten for it. This along with the mentioned example of swinging versus Liriano provides us with strong evidence to believe that negligible effort has been given to improving the hitters' performance.   This is probable to be attributed to one of three things:    Players aren't respecting the coaching staff (improbable) The coaching staff isn't properly emphasizing the importance of changes in approach (possible) The coaching doesn't consider a change of approach important (probable)   If the first, bench and/or trade the offending players. If the second, sufficiently re-emphasize to the coaching staff and thus the players the importance of changes in approach. If the third, replace offending members of the coaching staff with those who will perform."
Cardinals,3dvzw2,letuotter,5,Mon Jul 20 00:39:45 2015 UTC,"Covane rants are a serious same.  (For the record, I agree)"
Cardinals,3dvzw2,Vocal_Antagonist,2,Mon Jul 20 02:34:52 2015 UTC,"Perhaps Mabry is not aware of different approaches to hitting?  Therefore, it would be impossible to change his approach."
Cardinals,3dvzw2,RedBirdHouse,2,Mon Jul 20 05:34:49 2015 UTC,I like you and your actual logic.
Cardinals,3dvzw2,heajv,-4,Mon Jul 20 14:30:43 2015 UTC,"So write the FO a letter or something.  Everyone here is just too worn out to care.  Personally, he could have replaced Yadi with Rosenthal and Grichuk with his dog and I wouldn't have cared.  This one game really doesn't merit that level of butthurt, especially when we all already know the coaching decisions are iffy sometimes and Mabry's not a great coach.  And we didn't hear this crap from you last night, did we?  TL;DR - Whoop-dee-frickin-do, man."
Cardinals,3dvzw2,ElectrifiedPop,10,Mon Jul 20 00:44:47 2015 UTC,"Well, it took the Mets 18 innings just to avoid being swept so...there's that."

Cardinals,3dvzw2,letuotter,4,Mon Jul 20 02:45:26 2015 UTC,"A starter with bullpen experience. This won't affect his innings limit since it just takes the place of his next start which would have been Tuesday. With the All-Star break just ending and the day off tomorrow giving guys extra rest, Matheny has the option of calling up someone to pitch Tuesday or moving the rotation up one day. Better to save some bullpen arms (if there are any left) since there are no more days off this month."
Cardinals,3dvzw2,ladygagadisco,2,Mon Jul 20 06:44:54 2015 UTC,Agree but what's the alternative if you're Mike today?
Cardinals,3dvzw2,F117Nighthawk,2,Mon Jul 20 04:39:23 2015 UTC,Can we start a petition to change the last call policy at Busch in the case of extra inning games? That was a while second game without any beer. No wonder people were leaving in mobs. It was crazy empty and sober by the 18the.
Cardinals,3dvzw2,Pashto96,2,Mon Jul 20 04:43:54 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't work.  It's not like they just close the windows and go home, they have to break everything down and clean it.  Go extra, put it all back together, and then have to clean it twice?  I think they'd rather just skip the very small amount of extra income.  Also, then you can't predict when the game will end.  They stop serving in the 8th so that there's a small chance that people will actually be sober by the time they drive home.  If you want to drink for the entire game, then I'd suggest your couch (food is cheaper there anyway)."
Cardinals,3dvzw2,Afin12,2,Mon Jul 20 14:08:18 2015 UTC,Pirates go 0-3 against Brewers and we go 2-1 against Mets? Good start to the second half. I just wish we didn't tire our entire bullpen for this game.

He was, without a doubt, one of the nicest and most humble people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. He was stunned and I could tell that the drawing meant a lot to him.

I was with my family and we were out on the town for the night. we headed to the ESPN zone for some fun when it started pouring.   we get inside and started playing some games. we went upstairs and we see a nice sized group hanging around some guy. we get a good look at him and realize it's Steve Kline, dirty hat guy.   once the group started to clear up, my parents went up to him and introduced themselves, saying that we were from St. Louis and we enjoyed watching him pitch here etc. he was a real nice guy, he stayed and chatted for about ten minutes.   the best part was when he played a game. there was a pitching simulator where you throw a baseball to a digital batter and it shows your pitch speed. it looked like he was barely throwing it but he was hitting mid 80s. one guy eventually hits a home run off him and he says something like ""this is just like real life"" and made everyone laugh.   Steve Kline (dirty hat guy) was pretty cool."

They actually dislike Matt Adams because he was rude and dismissive. They also said he was wearing an affliction shirt and jean shorts. Take that for what it's worth.  I met Ozzie Smith when I worked at Enterprise rent a car. He couldn't have been nicer. Introduced himself as Ozzie right away, jokingly told us not to give out his address. Asked myself and my co worker about ourselves, and offered an autograph.   My dad went duck hunting with Red Schoendist and said he was super friendly and told great baseball stories the entire time."

Anyway, when I got to there, I got lost while doing the stadium tour with my group and randomly ended up being found by Jim Edmonds and someone else within the organization, who I presume was a trainer or something. The trainer guy helped me get back to my group, but I was more than a little starstruck upon meeting Mr. Edmonds back in the day. Unfortunately this was before everyone and their dog had a camera on their phone so I never got a picture with him, but 12 year old me was glad I got lost."

We sat down not too far away.  All night people were coming up to him to take pictures.  After a while, my friends decided it was their turn for a picture.  We went over and I said something like, ""Hey Dave, I'm sorry, man.  I know exactly how this goes.  I played volleyball for DeSmet, so I'm constantly being stopped for photos.""  He thought this was really funny.    We continued to joke a bit from our respective seats until he eventually invited me over to his little lounge area.  For the rest of the night, each time someone would come up for photos he would stop them and say, ""Wait a minute, you want a picture with me?  Do you realize who I'm with?  This is <my name>.  He played varsity at DeSmet"".  We ended up getting shitfaced together.  At the end of the night, we got our picture together and a bunch of random people at the bar took out their cell phones and were snapping shots of us.  People were actually convinced I was some kind of celebrity.  I had driven to the bar but was too drunk to drive home, and some random girl gave me a ride home because ""your friends with David Freese!""    He got traded the very next week.  I cried a little bit.    TLDR: Got bombed with David Freese because I played volleyball in high school."

In the parking lot after my dad had gotten the autographs he was looking for, we ran into Ozzie. He was super nice, signed some stuff for my dad and took a picture with me in my stroller.

Finally, and this isn't my story, but my step-aunt used to live next door to Mike Matheny. Her kids used to play catch with him in the backyard in the offseasons. I'm definitely jealous of them!"
Cardinals,3dw0rt,jbomble,2,Mon Jul 20 05:50:29 2015 UTC,"This happened over thirty years ago and I was five or six at the time, so I'm not entirely sure how accurate it is. I really only know it from family stories.  My aunt and uncle in Louisville owned a hair salon. Somehow, they had acquired a number of Louisville Redbird players as customers. We would visit my aunt and uncle every summer. They had a pool and one time, a number of the players came over for a swim. We also went and saw a Redbird game while there. Somewhere along there, I got many of them to sign a baseball for me (which I used to play catch with a couple of years later on a dewy lawn, smearing all of he signatures beyond recognition).  The only player whose name I remember was Tom Nieto. I believe that he was going to my aunt and uncle's church or something. I know that they kept in touch with him for a while after he moved from Louisville.   I was rather notorious for getting out of the pool and sitting down in the cushioned deck chairs without drying off at all. The story, as it has been told to me was that Tom Nieto had come by to visit not long after I had finished swimming. I believe he was going out and was dressed up pretty nice when he decided to sit by the pool and sat in the chair with the cushion that I had soaked with pool water. I inadvertently wet Tom Nieto's pants.  A decade later, when baseball cards were all the rage, I popped into a baseball card shop near my house. We were going to visit my aunt and uncle in a couple of weeks and I thought that they would appreciate a Tom Nieto baseball card. There were two older guys in the shop, the (what I would assume was) owner and a guy that I would guess just liked hanging out in the baseball card shop. I asked the guy behind the counter if he had any Tom Nieto cards and he said that he did. I asked how much they were, and it was something really low like three or four cents, I think. The guy had ten or so of them, so I said that I would buy them all. I remember the clerk looking at the other guy and asking him, ""You heard anything about Tom Nieto lately?"" I'm pretty sure that I have a couple of Tom Nieto cards in a box somewhere."

We had nosebleed seats but my dad somehow got me down to first base line to attempt to get autographs before the game. I'm standing there and Wayne Hagen(the old cards broadcaster) tosses me a ball sitting on the baseline. I was a bit of an awkward kid and the ball proceeded to hit me right in the face. I start to get a slight nosebleed and he pulls me over the wall and brings me on the field to meet some players. I met So Taguchi and a few hall of famers. (I was like 10, so the older players didn't make as big of a impact.) One of my best memories with baseball."

He built John Mabrys house and talked to him and Mike Matheny about hunting for a couple hours, I have a ball signed by Mabry. This was years ago when they were still players. He also built Ozzie's and Kurt Warner's (I know not a cardinal) house. Warner was actually supposed to sign a football for me and my sister but his wife told my dad no whenever he brought them to the house because it was after Trent Green went down and Warner was starting. God, that could've been worth some money now.  Personally, I've met Carlos Martinez, I have a picture with him at BPV after his first start. He didn't speak a word of English so we talked to his translator most.   Then at wheelhouse, some friends and I met Matt Adams, Wacha, and Siegrist. Shook their hands. Adams was the only one that really talked to us, which he did for like an hour and called one of our other friends who loves him. He left her a voicemail and she was so pissed the next morning. Wacha and Siegrist were pretty preoccupied by some girls but I don't blame them. This was right before their playoff run last year.   Jim Edmonds flipped my friend off at BPV when he tried to take a picture of him. It was hilarious.  We've also talked to Micheal Sam (football again) at BPV right after he was drafted by the Rams. He was extremely nice.  I saw Ozzie Smith at the store I was working at asking for directions.   This was all in the last couple years. Pretty cool experiences."

Well he comes out and says he is in a meeting and will be out in a bit and for us to just sit tight.  So after about 5 minutes I'm standing there and out walks Matt Holliday.  I'm totally dying and my husbands shouts, ""hey Matt, can we get a picture?"".  Well, he stops and shakes our hand and then lets us take a picture.  He actually seemed friendly enough, but maybe a little bothered and then went on his way.  Well, evidently that was not something we should have done because the guy at the gate came over and said we shouldn't have done that but said not to worry about it because he could tell how much it meant to me!  haha.  So then, as we're still standing there waiting Wainwright and Adams both walk by and all we could do was say, ""hey"" and let them walk on by.  That's my story!  Also, I met Grichuk, Scruggs, Ty Kelly and Tuivailala at the Caravan and I'm actually in the background of tweet that Sam did with the daughter of one of my friends!

They just had the All-Star break, and we have a day off tomorrow. He also could have hit & run at least 3 different times with Yadi batting.

The way Martinez was clearly falling apart last inning it seems like it would have made sense to put Rosie in. Since they didn't I have to imagine he's off limits.

Scary thing is, that this  is entirely possible. The Pirates have been on that kind of pace since May.   Gotta keep it going. This team cannot afford to get complacent.  Good news is that by the same Token if the Pirates cool off and say go 40-32, then we would only need to go 36-35 to polish off the division"

Cardinals,3dspse,zakmac85,7,Sun Jul 19 06:54:55 2015 UTC,Is Heyward the new Holliday? That summer heat up sure seems familiar.
Cardinals,3dspse,cats_just_in_space,4,Sun Jul 19 03:30:21 2015 UTC,I think the getting hit in the face effective him more then we thought.... Stanton started slow too
Cardinals,3dspse,kuhanluke,3,Sun Jul 19 06:43:41 2015 UTC,He was hit years ago. This is classic Heyward. He regularly heats up with the weather.

Cardinals,3dspse,Hxcfrog090,4,Sun Jul 19 02:48:58 2015 UTC,No way. He's gonna want a long term deal. No chance does he only take 2 years. Especially for 5 mil a year. Peralta is getting 12 mil a year I think.

Cardinals,3dspse,kuhanluke,3,Sun Jul 19 06:45:21 2015 UTC,You must've missed the GDT. Heyward absolutely isn't going for less than 100/5

Cardinals,3dspse,GrubFisher,-1,Sun Jul 19 06:52:11 2015 UTC,Then I guess it's a matter of... how much does he actually want to go to the World Series? He can sign with us and have a chance of that.. or he can sign with a team from Los Angeles and make obscene amounts of money no matter what happens.
Cardinals,3dspse,kuhanluke,2,Sun Jul 19 07:50:30 2015 UTC,"In 2015/16 and he's still 25 years old. This is a possible future franchise player. If he gets the biggest yearly rate in Cardinals history, it'll be worth it. We signed Holliday when he was 30. Heyward will be 26."
Cardinals,3dspse,GrubFisher,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:13:56 2015 UTC,The biggest yearly rate in team history still won't match any other team with a new  TV deal.
Cardinals,3dspse,kuhanluke,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:24:58 2015 UTC,Cards TV deal ends in 2017. They could just slightly backload a theoretical Heyward contract.   And another team could go higher but do the Dodgers or Yankees really want to? Even Jacoby Ellsbury's deal was only 21m/yr for 7yr. And he's a 40-steal CF who hit 32 homers in 2011.  And the Dodgers still have too many OF.

Cardinals,3dspse,kuhanluke,2,Sun Jul 19 06:21:37 2015 UTC,That was 25¢ for 20oz. Now it's 50¢ any size.
Cardinals,3dspse,fps916,2,Sun Jul 19 06:53:46 2015 UTC,6 is the number of runs Grichuk alone was responsible for producing
Cardinals,3dspse,studoggery,4,Sun Jul 19 03:41:41 2015 UTC,Grichuk is pretty serious then
Cardinals,3dspse,toastdispatch,19,Sun Jul 19 04:04:42 2015 UTC,"Looking back on it Mo really swindled the Angles in that Freese trade, got a decent CF / bench depth, but really a potential superstar prospect in Grichuk in exchange for a good player who's talent and trade value had both peaked."
Cardinals,3dspse,crackalac,14,Sun Jul 19 02:29:38 2015 UTC,Jim Edmonds trade turned into a nice haul of players all said and done.
Cardinals,3dspse,apiratewithadd,8,Sun Jul 19 02:31:23 2015 UTC,You mean Kent Bottenfield
Cardinals,3dspse,kuhanluke,10,Sun Jul 19 02:42:56 2015 UTC,Turned Bottenfield into Edmonds into Freese into Grichuk.   Beautiful.
Cardinals,3dspse,crackalac,19,Sun Jul 19 02:47:39 2015 UTC,"Edmonds got us a ring, freese got us a ring, let's go grichuk."
Cardinals,3dspse,kuhanluke,4,Sun Jul 19 02:52:19 2015 UTC,Bottenfield was a slacker.
Cardinals,3dspse,crackalac,5,Sun Jul 19 02:58:17 2015 UTC,Well he indirectly got us two.
Cardinals,3dspse,bustysteclair,3,Sun Jul 19 02:59:17 2015 UTC,so far
Cardinals,3dspse,crackalac,2,Sun Jul 19 06:58:39 2015 UTC,True.
Cardinals,3dspse,reallifebadass,8,Sun Jul 19 02:50:17 2015 UTC,"and a guy he threw in right as they shook hands and said ""not take backs"""
Cardinals,3dspse,iamadacheat,9,Sun Jul 19 02:31:09 2015 UTC,It was essentially Freese for Bourjos and Salas for Grichuk.  Freese for Bourjos straight up seemed like a fair deal for both sides at the time.  Salas for Grichuk is just straight highway robbery.
Cardinals,3dspse,toastdispatch,4,Sun Jul 19 02:36:10 2015 UTC,"Forgot Salas was part of the package, even so it's still an amazing flip, Angles had no idea who they had in Grichuk."
Cardinals,3dspse,iamadacheat,7,Sun Jul 19 02:37:21 2015 UTC,Getting rid of Salas made the trade even better.
Cardinals,3dspse,fps916,2,Sun Jul 19 02:39:24 2015 UTC,"I mean, they kinda did. Grichuk was their draft pick immediately before Trout"
Cardinals,3dspse,Hxcfrog090,2,Sun Jul 19 03:45:36 2015 UTC,"True....but people don't really realize why they picked him before Trout. They fully knew Trout was the better player. So they took Grichuk before him so they could have Trout under a little more cost control. Not much, but a little bit. They never viewed Grichuk as the better player."
Cardinals,3dspse,fps916,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:23:36 2015 UTC,I know. My point was that they know how valuable Grichuk is because he was in the same ballpark as Trout in draft order/desirability.
Cardinals,3dspse,Hxcfrog090,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:02:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely true. I know theCards had interest in him, but decided they needed pitching more. I believe they took Shelby Miller"
Cardinals,3dspse,fps916,2,Sun Jul 19 07:22:37 2015 UTC,Yep. The worst part is that we were expecting to draft Trout because we were sure the Rangers were going to take Miller ahead of us and Trout was number 2 on our list.  Fuck the Rangers
Cardinals,3dspse,kuhanluke,4,Sun Jul 19 07:53:03 2015 UTC,They did know. They just thought they had more outfield depth.
Cardinals,3dspse,koalabear78,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:48:12 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they did already have Mike Trout."

Cardinals,3dspse,Salesman89,2,Sun Jul 19 04:01:44 2015 UTC,"28 year old outfielder for a 32 year old 1st baseman?    We'd have to throw in one of our top prospects on top of bourjos (like gonzo or piscotty)  it's a sexy idea, but would be hard to pull off.  The Brewers have been a winning team since the end of April and might not sell as easily as people might think."

Also, I'm eyeing a set of Covert 2.0 Irons and I'm considering either a) living really cheaply for a month or b) starting a kickstarter in order to afford them. I'm probably going to have to go with option A, because I'd feel a little guilty going, ""come on, guys, five dollars each and we could probably get really close to the full cost.

Cardinals,3dp8g7,Undeniably_Awesome,2,Sat Jul 18 03:20:10 2015 UTC,"Tonight felt like a really bad representation of Rosenthal. Sure, his last few appearances didn't end well, but tonight bad luck kind of put him into a sticky situation. A hit from a really good hitter in Duda, a misplay between Wong and Heyward, and the softest hit groundball I've ever seen seem to be the factors in pushing Rosenthal's pitch count up, thus putting more stress on his shoulders. Hopefully Rosenthal is unavailable tomorrow no matter what, but I'm still pretty comfortable that Rosenthal is perfectly fine."
Cardinals,3dp8g7,AsaKurai,2,Sat Jul 18 03:36:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Mets announcers said he looked to be laboring and I wonder if he has any issues since he didn't start the ASG either but i'm not sure. He's had a good first half so you can't give up on him yet"
Cardinals,3dp8g7,Undeniably_Awesome,2,Sat Jul 18 03:50:09 2015 UTC,"I believe he didn't play in the ASG because he told Bochy that he felt a little tightness in the arm and that he was fatigued, which has proven to be a problem for him. It's all most likely due to him being overworked, which Matheny seems to do quite a bit, with Siegrist also."
Cardinals,3dp8g7,AsaKurai,2,Sat Jul 18 04:01:32 2015 UTC,Definitely need some bullpen help at the deadline. Siegrest and Rosie have been doing a lot.
Cardinals,3dp8g7,Undeniably_Awesome,2,Sat Jul 18 04:06:34 2015 UTC,"Getting Walden back from the DL will be huge. It'll be good having an 8th inning guy to help Siegrist out and also having experience closing. Belisle will also help out a lot. But yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing Mo try and find a useful bullpen arm before or at the deadline."
Cardinals,3dp8g7,kuhanluke,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:16:55 2015 UTC,"Can always use extra bullpen arms. Siegrist, Walden, Rosie for the last three innings, plus Maness, Choate, and Villanueva deployed situationally, and then some trade target to replace Tui/Harris/Soco/AAA whoever. Then we have a couple guys for September and October if need be."
Cardinals,3dp8g7,civilaiden,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:24:20 2015 UTC,"When Walden and Belisle get back the AAA guys will be gone(knock on wood).  Walden, Belisle, Rosie, Choate, Maness, Siegrist, Villanueva would be our opening day bullpen roster(7 pitchers). We've juggled a 8th up here to help when our arms were getting tired out but in general 7 is the norm."
Cardinals,3dp8g7,kuhanluke,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:54:06 2015 UTC,"Oh right, I forgot about Belisle. Damn, that's a fine looking 'pen. I guess we could get a lefty to replace Choate but once our bullpen is healthy, i can't see any holes.   Something feels wrong about that."
Cardinals,3dp8g7,civilaiden,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:22:52 2015 UTC,Its hard to keep up with the breakneck pace the DL monster has been on.
Cardinals,3dp8g7,Mister_Yuk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:54:49 2015 UTC,Getting Walden back should help with that. It's like making a trade without giving anybody up.
Cardinals,3dp8g7,civilaiden,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:23:46 2015 UTC,Getting Walden and Belisle back will go a long way in helping. They're still a bit away from returning but they're both big arms we're expecting back. In the mean time Matheny is just going to have to find spots to put in Socolovich and Tuivailala.
Cardinals,3dp8g7,kuhanluke,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:33:13 2015 UTC,I think he didn't play because Matheny told Bochy he needed the days off after a couple of tough appearances in back-to-back games. It was officially listed as arm tightness.
Cardinals,3dp8g7,fre1102,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:09:59 2015 UTC,"What terrified me about Rosenthal last night was how terrified he was to throw to two .100 batters. I'm not exaggerating at all when I say I'm reasonably confident I could strike out Kurt Nieuwenhuis and John Mayberry on three pitches. For the record, my fastball tops out at 80 m.p.h....if I load it into the pitching machine the right way. Rosenthal looked like he was pitching to Trout and Harper.  I'm starting to worry about him. I was hoping that the start of this season was him turning the corner. I guess not."

Cardinals,3dp8g7,Undeniably_Awesome,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:28:41 2015 UTC,I don't think you can really lump tonight's performance in with his last couple. Tonight just had a bunch of bad luck for him that made his job harder than it should be.
Cardinals,3dp8g7,fre1102,0,Sat Jul 18 03:39:11 2015 UTC,"Nah, while Heyward should have caught that ball, it was still Rosenthal being Rosenthal. Try to nibble at the edges, pussy out, let the batter hang around until he get a hit (or you walk him), etc.  Yes, poor defense didn't help him, but that's his usual m.o.   We need a closer. A shut-down, you're-not-getting-on-base, I'm-already-angry-at-the-batter-just-for-being-there closer.  We really, really, REALLY need to let Roesnthal try to start next spring and get a real closer.

Cardinals,3do5bd,NinjaChemist,2,Fri Jul 17 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"I say over. The one good thing about this DL stint is it had nothing to do with his arm. I'm most worried about the arm issues coming back, so a little extra rest for his arm might have been good in that respect."
Cardinals,3do5bd,Amerikkalainen,2,Sun Jul 19 04:49:04 2015 UTC,"My theory is he was ""injured"" and this was just to rest his arm in a clever way."
Cardinals,3do5bd,apiratewithadd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:02:26 2015 UTC,You should set your over/under at 4.5 or 5.5. But either way I would definitely take the over.

Cardinals,3do5bd,gotsnow,2,Sat Jul 18 03:19:06 2015 UTC,I hope he comes off the DL just in time to use as trade bait. I wonder if anyone is interested and how other teams rate and value him?
Cardinals,3do5bd,wanderinhebrew,3,Sat Jul 18 15:15:20 2015 UTC,Trade bait? Are you suggesting we keep throwing Cooney out there?

Cardinals,3dpf86,kuhanluke,2,Sat Jul 18 04:25:47 2015 UTC,"He currently has a 133 wRC+, so he is doing very nice job of producing runs. If you are to compare him to the really elite TTO guys, his .18 BB/K needs to go up like two fold. So, either he needs to start walking more like Stanton who is also striking out ~30% of the time, but walks ~10% of the time; or stop striking out so much."
Cardinals,3dpf86,nufandan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:41:46 2015 UTC,"He has dropped off significantly, to the point where he was a 100 wRC+ hitter in July. And I don't know if the 133 was ever sustainable with the OBP the way it was."
Cardinals,3dpf86,nufandan,2,Sat Jul 18 07:28:34 2015 UTC,"i mean there's still a lot left in July, and possibly encouraging is that he's walked 10% of the time so far this month. Not sure what's causing his power outage this month though."
Cardinals,3dpf86,iamadacheat,2,Sat Jul 18 15:55:07 2015 UTC,Counter question: what BA and SLG would a guy need to be productive if he never walked?
Cardinals,3dpf86,Davidfreeze,3,Sat Jul 18 14:03:55 2015 UTC,They'd have to add to .710 to have a league average OPS. So if you hit .280 and never walked you'd need to slug .430 to be league average. That's almost averaging a double every other hit.
Cardinals,3dpf86,Alexhasskills,3,Sat Jul 18 19:14:24 2015 UTC,Which Randal does. I believe.
Cardinals,3dpf86,Davidfreeze,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:21:31 2015 UTC,"That is just to be league average and that's assuming a .280 average which is hard for a line drive hitter with a high k%. (Low BABIP plus fewer balls in play) I think Grich can be great, but I don't think anything above average is sustainable unless he cuts down on Ks or increase walks. (Which he totally can, and if he does, his slugging will be there for sure and he can be a great player)"
Cardinals,3dpf86,bjsy92,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:35:45 2015 UTC,With .710 as the OPS would you rather have .280/.280/.430 than .280/.310/.400?
Cardinals,3dpf86,Davidfreeze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:05:08 2015 UTC,"Probably the first one, although id argue it's harder to maintain that one, as you're relying very heavily on BABIP luck."
Cardinals,3dpf86,bjsy92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:08:26 2015 UTC,Yeah but it would seem that you'd almost have to be hitting the ball hard to be slugging so well comparatively. Interesting to discuss either way.
Cardinals,3dpf86,manifestDensity,2,Mon Jul 20 15:16:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that there is a magic number for Grichuk just yet.  We need to see what type of hitter he actually becomes before setting those type of targets.  He's unique in that he squares up almost everything he hits.  Even his ground outs are hit hard.  While this certainly helps his SLG, it actually drives down his BA as he is not getting many infield hits or bloop singles.  Comparisons to hitters like Stanton miss the mark because he lacks that type of power profile.  A big chunk of the walks you see Stanton get are either IBB or situations where he is being pitched around.  Grichuk has not yet established himself as the kind of sustained power threat that teams feel the need to pitch around him in most circumstances.  The next year or two will tell if Grichuk is a guy who can burn you if you make a mistake, like a young Mark Reynolds, or if he can become a guy who can burn you on your best pitch, like Stanton.  If he becomes the former then he's never going to draw a lot of walks regardless of how good his plate discipline becomes simply because pitchers will work for that K.  If he becomes more like Stanton, or even a Holliday / Peralta type hitter, then the walks will come as he gains more respect around the league."
Cardinals,3dpf86,cats_just_in_space,2,Sat Jul 18 16:41:25 2015 UTC,he has the third best WAR in the lineup on the best team in baseball at age 23 I think he will be okay

Cardinals,3dnyti,Pashto96,-3,Fri Jul 17 21:14:50 2015 UTC,"""Average"" is being very generous. He sucks. He was horrible at the major league level last year, and even his Triple-A numbers this year have been atrocious."

He'll go a few games of giving up 0-3 runs in 5+IP and then he'll just get blown out. Right now I could see him becoming a Tyler Lyons kind of player in the future"

Cardinals,3dm7mm,1859,15,Fri Jul 17 16:40:41 2015 UTC,"How can you football fans put up with only one game a week (or two weeks, depending on the schedule)? That seems like torture."
Cardinals,3dm7mm,F117Nighthawk,11,Fri Jul 17 13:45:43 2015 UTC,"At Ole Miss and many other college football schools, it's a different beast entirely. The dynamic is totally different. Baseball means enjoying the game anytime, anywhere. I could throw on a shersey and hit up Busch, or I can open a beer and watch at home in my pajama pants.   But football games are a holiday that happens three times a month in the fall. They're the reason that September weekends exist. You put on your slacks, maybe a bowtie if you're feeling Rosenthally, and hit the Grove. Tents are everywhere, and they're ridiculous: chandeliers, silver buffet tables filled with everything from homemade brisket to Krystal burgers, surround sound satellite TVs to catch up with the rest of the SEC, and so much alcohol. Even the opposing team's fans get fed and socialized. It's like a block party with 50000 of your closest neighbors. Plenty of times you see four generations of family hanging out and watching for the game. I didn't care about football at all until I lived in Mississippi. It's irresistible and inescapable around here. You put up with a week of waiting because the day itself is just that special.  In the South, there is nothing more popular than football and religion. And during the fall, sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart."
Cardinals,3dm7mm,1859,5,Fri Jul 17 14:21:53 2015 UTC,"You said Krystal burgers! OH MY GOD I MISS THOSE SO MUCH! When I went to Bama, I lived for Sunday when my Great Aunt would buy Krystal burgers and I'd go to her place and watch crappy Lifetime movies with her.  You explained SEC football to a tee. It IS a religion. I couldn't handle multiple games a week. It would be too many emotions, too much stress...my body needs the weekdays to recoup."
Cardinals,3dm7mm,reallifebadass,5,Fri Jul 17 14:51:15 2015 UTC,"Yessss Krystal! My pops grew up in the South, and every time we'd road trip down here, he'd buy us a pile of Krystal burgers.

The Cardinals do like to complain about other teams' stadiums. They've said things ground crews have found insulting. When they lose a game to another NL Central team, there's always some excuse for it. Something wrong with the pitching mound or whatever. This is more on the managers and coaches than the players.    I have NEVER heard this before.  Is this something people say about the Cardinals or is this just one guys opinion?  I thought it was weird."

Cardinals,3dm7mm,evilrobotluke,3,Fri Jul 17 16:04:51 2015 UTC,"Figured. You can still get something nice though. The velvet jacket is timeless (just get wool pants with it), but be sure that it is cut slim. You think it is to tight? If you can button the top button and fit your hand into the jacket below the button then it isn't.  ALWAYS GO BOWTIE. Black specifically. I prefer diamond point or batwing but butterfly looks best in tuxedo mode so any bowtie will suffice. IF you're going to wear a pocket square then don't stray from the classic white. I would probably suggest linen and a presidential or 'square' fold, but if silk is all that is available then puff fold generally looks good too.   Tuxedos require black shoes of course (even a navy or burgundy tux). Patent leather is the way to go, but the problem that it is basically the only thing you would wear patent leather with, so I wouldn't sweat just any pair of black derbies (avoid oxfords for this one though)."

Cardinals,3dm7mm,komradekommunism,6,Fri Jul 17 16:25:11 2015 UTC,"Totally depends on the wedding. Although, I would think it would be weird for the groom to be in a tux and the groosmen to be in suits because that would imply a different level of formality. Usually, it's either all suits or all tuxes with slight variations to distinguish the groom (color, vest, tie, etc.)."

Cardinals,3dm7mm,komradekommunism,3,Fri Jul 17 16:29:43 2015 UTC,The bride shouldn't get any say whatsoever. 90% of women know nothing about menswear but they all think that they do. My female coworkers completely agree.
Cardinals,3dm7mm,komradekommunism,2,Fri Jul 17 16:34:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. A nice, tailored suit looks WAY better than a rental tux 99% of the time. And it has rewear value."

Cardinals,3dm7mm,kuhanluke,4,Fri Jul 17 17:23:00 2015 UTC,This is the 100% truth. You have your facts as correct as possible given current veterinary science
Cardinals,3dm7mm,SouthpawRage,3,Fri Jul 17 17:25:07 2015 UTC,Why would anyone do that to begin with? Just look at their teeth... clearly carnivores.

Cardinals,3dm7mm,bustysteclair,3,Fri Jul 17 14:44:53 2015 UTC,Yep I have the same issue. That's why separate alarms one or two minutes apart for a 15 minute period.

I think it was one if the extended stay ones. That was during July 4th weekend too, so hotels shouldn't be bad at all if you don't stay at any of the fancy ones.   I ate at the BBQ place (just remembered it is called the salt lick) right by their stadium while I was there. Everybody who goes should eat there before the game."

Cardinals,3dhyiz,F117Nighthawk,2,Thu Jul 16 20:01:55 2015 UTC,"My parents aren't into the NFL, but my dad always has followed Bama and SEC boys. So I used to watch Seattle a lot because of Shaun Alexander. When I really started to get into the NFL, Peyton had just been drafted. He is a good ole SEC boy, my dad loves him, and I was born in New Orleans where his dad played...so I followed Indy a lot. Then Eli got drafted, and I followed the Giants. Houston finally got a team, so I watched a lot of Texans games. Peyton got traded, so I started watching Broncos more. For a while, a lot of Bama boys were at Kansas City. Now Clinton-Dix and Lacy are at Green Bay. Richardson I still follow although he isn't doing as well. Same with Ingram. I lived in Dallas for a while...and while I don't like the Cowboys a lot, I find myself rooting for them when they aren't playing teams I like or have boys on them that I like. Living in StL, I obviously have always had feelings towards the Rams.  I just moved around a lot, and my parents didn't raise me to like one team. But I follow the NFL religiously.  Currently because of players and teams: 1) Broncos 2) Giants 3) Texans 4) Rams 5) Indy 6) Green Bay....then it gets jumbled."

Cardinals,3dh3x9,fasterdriver,6,Thu Jul 16 05:46:47 2015 UTC,"No one likes to hear this, but this organization did not need $520 million of public money towards the new stadium.  Source:   The Cardinals put up an estimated $420 million in initial private funding: bonds cost plus retirement and owner’s equity investment. However, the Cardinals also receive significant returns through an estimated $520 million in public subsidies: $350 million from St. Louis City’s five percent admission tax 30-year waiver, $20 million from St. Louis City’s 25-year property tax abatement, $108 million paid by St. Louis County to retire the $45 million in stadium bonds, and $42 million from Missouri tax credits and highway ramp construction"

Cardinals,3dh3x9,ElScreecho,0,Thu Jul 16 20:12:49 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll use that number. Let's conservatively estimate the city takes in 10% of revenue(impact).  To be profitable on 520M investment it would need to demonstrate 17M/year or $173M of revenue.  This number is over 50% of 338.  To be profitable, the economic gain must have been > 100% than without a new stadium or (more likely) a stadium funded w/o public money.  Do you really believe that is the case?"
Cardinals,3dh3x9,DrKedorkian,8,Thu Jul 16 20:44:46 2015 UTC,"I do not think that the city itself will turn a profit. However, I would also like you to consider what has happened in the city of Atlanta. The city did not come up with money for new stadiums for the Falcons and Braves. Neighboring Cobb County did. As such, the Falcons and Braves will move. They will take with them not just the obvious jobs with the team, but the secondary ones involved with the stadium, the parking, the pre and post game bars and restaurants, the hotel workers, and other things that would otherwise have remained in Atlanta. A sports team certainly creates a thousand jobs, and creating jobs is a valuable political commodity. Chesterfield or St. Charles or someplace in the Metro East would have found a way to put up the cash. When you consider that STL itself is only on the hook for $370 million of that, $12 million a year to keep those jobs and the prestige of being the city that gets to host the Cardinals is chump change."
Cardinals,3dh3x9,ElScreecho,3,Thu Jul 16 21:22:31 2015 UTC,"I think Return on Investment is a better term for this discussion, but to your question.... it is complicated to determine.  You'd have to project what we think the Cardinals economic impact would have been without Busch Stadium, and their economic impact if they funded the stadium all on their own.  Because both scenarios could have an impact on their operating budgets and in turn affect the products they field and thus impact how the fans support the organization (Bad product usually means less fan support).  When the new stadium was being considered and St Louis was non-committal, The Cardinals even explored other locations....would the Cardinals have even stayed downtown or could a more affluent area of the Metro Area like St Charles, have captured the Cardinals? (Kind of like the Braves move away from Atlanta to Cobb County).  It would be a very plausible event; the population moved away from downtown st louis years ago and brought their money with them..... so you see very complicated to answer.    But I do believe that it is easy to say that they've had a measurable impact on the local economy and the City Revenue itself.  In 2011, it was reported that the October playoff run itself generated enough Sales Tax revenue to overcome a $2.8Mil deficit and a 2,700 employee furlough and even created a budget surplus.  That playoff run was reported to have generate $3.5 Mil in Sales tax, and the Worlds Series itself generated $15Mil in economic impact.    All that being said in general St Louis is very lucky that the MLB team they partnered with is very well managed.  It could easily be like Miami or Houston where the teams are an drain on the municipalities budgets because they don't generate the revenue originally projected.  There aren't guarantees of that type of success, so unless the cities develop partnerships or treat it like an investment.... I'm very much so against such ventures."

Cardinals,3dh3x9,chiwork,7,Thu Jul 16 16:14:04 2015 UTC,"It's a valuation.   Think of it in baseball terms. When teams make deadline deals, there are two ways to determine the value of a player. You trade the proven veteran for his immediate production (the cardinals), for the prospects that could one day match that player or even best them (cubs).   So this is saying, if the Cubs had the same success the Cardinals have had over the past 15 years, and they were clearly the #1 sports draw in the city and region they would be bringing in more money via TV deals, merchandise, and ticket sales. It's impossible to dispute that."

Cardinals,3dh50c,Maverick814,6,Thu Jul 16 11:44:15 2015 UTC,look at all those bad players at the bottom to whom we've been forced to give playing time because of injuries
Cardinals,3dh50c,flagamuffin,2,Thu Jul 16 09:51:43 2015 UTC,"Eh, not really. A handful of first basemen, a couple of middle relievers, and less than 50 innings of two lefthanders trying to fill a void left by Adam Wainwright.  Besides that, Bourjos, Cruz, and Kozma, who are at the bottom three, were all on the opening day roster and have gotten pretty much the playing time you'd expect from bench players. And those are the only three guys who will finish the season truly below replacement level if everyone continues to play at their current pace, since Lyons likely won't be called up again until September, Pham will be sent down when Holliday comes back in a few days, and Johnson will be sent down once (hopefully) we acquire a 1B to supplant Reynolds.  And I wouldn't get rid of Bourjos because he's not as bad as his 2015 WAR and I wouldn't get rid of Cruz without finding an outside replacement for him (because our internal options aren't really ready yet; I doubt Ed Easley or Cody Stanley is really much of an improvement). I'd get rid of Kozma in a heartbeat though. Don't understand why he's ahead of Greg Garcia on the depth chart. Are they just keeping Pete around until he's no longer pre-arb so they can have three pre-arb years of Garcia once they cut Kozma loose after 2016? Because if so, that's a terrible plan and what the fuck.  But yeah, I guess Bourjos technically got extra playing time because Holliday was hurt, but it was mostly because Jay was underperforming. So Bourjos got playing time because Grichuk was playing LF for the injured Holliday instead of CF for the struggling Jay. But otherwise, the 1B situation isn't much worse with Reynolds/Johnson/Scruggs than it was with Adams/Reynolds, and the RP situation is always in flux. So really, the only big loss we took due to injury was the Cooney/Lyons situation replacing Adam Wainwright, because Jaime was performing admirably in that role until he himself was injured.  SOOOOOO:  Adam Wainwright's replacements have been worth 1.3 avgWAR, where he would've been worth ~2  Matt Adams' replacement has been worth 0 avgWAR, where he would've been worth ~0.5  --Mark Reynolds' replacements have been worth -0.2 avgWAR where he would've been worth 0.2ish  Matt Holliday's replacement has been worth 1.8 WAR where he would've been worth ~1.0  --Randal Grichuk's replacements have been worth -0.2 WAR where he would've been worth 0.8ish  And I guess the revolving reliever door filling the Walden/Belisle void hasn't been very good, but not really that bad.  All in all, it's really not as bad as you're making it out to be."
Cardinals,3dh50c,thetasigma1355,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:33:49 2015 UTC,"Matt Holliday's replacement has been worth 1.8 WAR where he would've been worth ~1.0   Am I missing something? Holliday was already above 1.0 WAR and while Grichuk is at 1.8ish, it's kind of unfair to compare as he was already getting playing time off the bench.   Randal has certainly played well, I'm just not getting the 1.0 to 1.8 comparison. Grichuk would be lower if he was truly only serving as Holliday's replacement, and Holliday's should be projected higher than ""would've been worth ~1.0"" (unless you mean 1.0 more than his current WAR?)"
Cardinals,3dh50c,thetasigma1355,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:20:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do mean 1.0 more than his current WAR and you're right that the Grichuk comparison isn't quite fair; though I can't find a way to compare it more evenly. There's no ""Split WAR"" option on Fangraphs or bbref"
Cardinals,3dh50c,flagamuffin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:49:34 2015 UTC,I think it would have made more sense if you'd said    Matt Holliday's replacement has been worth 1.8 WAR where he would've been worth ~2.2    Just threw me
Cardinals,3dh50c,evanb_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:07:09 2015 UTC,"But that's inaccurate as well. Because the 1.8 WAR includes time that Grichuk spent as a bench player and on the DL himself. What I need to isolate is Grichuk in June and July and compare that to what Holliday would have done in that timeframe. Because Grichuk, in the same number of PA as Holliday was worth more WAR, so his 1.8 BA doesn't compare to Holliday's ~2.2. 2.2 is what Holliday would've put up in twice the PA he currently has."

Cardinals,3dh50c,makagulfazel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:45:06 2015 UTC,you're doing the Wainwright replacement wrong
Cardinals,3dh50c,thatoneguy211,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:17:04 2015 UTC,You're right. He'd be worth closer to 2.5-3 WAR.
Cardinals,3dh50c,DiscoJer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:19:14 2015 UTC,"plus I don't think his replacement has been worth that much. You have to factor in that Garcia would probably still be on the roster and pitching in the bullpen, while Greenwood/Socolovich/Harris would be getting fewer innings or none at all."
Cardinals,3dh50c,bdmflyer,3,Sat Jul 18 17:02:41 2015 UTC,"Boy, does Carlos have an fWAR-bWAR disparity. Most people prefer fWAR for pitchers, since it uses FIP as opposed to bWAR, which uses RA9   That never made sense to me. Why judge a pitcher based on what theoretically should have happened according to some guy's formula vs what actually happened?  That's like judging hitters on line drive % and power on fly ball %.   Inducing ground balls is something a pitcher can do, yet FIP penalizes them for it (and thus their fWAR)"
Cardinals,3dh50c,msoverby10,5,Thu Jul 16 10:17:28 2015 UTC,"RA9 includes unearned runs, and therefore penalizes you for defense behind you. Neither fWAR nor bWAR is perfect. But FIP is unaffected by your team's defense.  For example, look at this WAR chart for Rick Porcello, who is a noted groundball pitcher:    Year fWAR bWAR 3B UZR SS UZR 2B UZR Tot UZR    2009 1.2 2.5 3.8 4.6 11.3 19.7   2010 1.6 0.1 1.8 8.1 -0.4 9.5   2011 2.1 0.2 -7.1 12.2 -4.7 0.4   2012 2.7 1.5 -11.6 11.0 1.5 0.9   2013 2.8 2.4 -12.1 6.0 -0.1 -6.2   2014 2.7 4.0 -21.6 -1.5 13.6 -9.5    So, basically, Porcello, who induces a lot of ground balls to the left side, has a higher bWAR when with better 2B defense and a lower bWar with worse 2B defense, but his fWAR hovers around the same. 2013 is an outlier as far as the 2B UZR/bWAR correlation, but was also the year that he induced his most Outfield Fly Balls to a decent outfield; It's also when he induced his most Pull% to primarily righthanded hitters, so he was helped by his shortstops, primarily Jhonny Peralta and Jose Iglesias.  FIP doesn't penalize you for inducing ground balls, it just doesn't reward you for them, RA9 does penalize you for ground balls though.  And also, I definitely judge hitters on LD% and FB% all the time. A player with solid GB/LD/FB numbers and Hard Hit % with a low AVG/SLG is usually an outlier. If I'm judging how good someone is, I don't necessarily want to look at the exact results, but rather the things in the player's control to produce those results. If Player X has a .380 BAbip, I'd want to look at his GB/LD/FB rates and speed to see if that's sustainable. With a guy like Ichiro, it absolutely was. But some players, you'll see get lucky on Fly Balls or on Line Drives, but their traditional stats are all pretty good in large part to their unsustainable BAbip."
Cardinals,3dh50c,WhuddaWhat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:00:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, FIP is lame in its original - and simple - format. WHIP is my favorite stat if I want to make a quick judgment of a pitcher's performance. Do you get lucky with defense sometimes? Sure.. But ultimately judging someone on ""expected"" performance using only strikeouts, walks, HPB and homeruns is illogical to me."
Cardinals,3dh50c,WhuddaWhat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:35:29 2015 UTC,"Why judge a pitcher based on what theoretically should have happened according to some guy's formula vs what actually happened?   It's a better predictor of future success, so I guess it depends on what you're using it for. I like thinking of it as bWAR shows who was the best, and fWAR shows who probably should have been the best, and who will be the best going forward. There's a number of cool studies out there that show the accuracy of various ERA estimators (with SIERA almost unanimously being the best)."

But 1B is our area of most need  Bullpen arms are always useful. You can never have enough bullpen depth. We have Walden back soon, which is nice, but more arms means we can stash some of the younger guys back in AAA for later callups.  We don't need to overpay for an ace. Our pitching is more than fine right now. The only issue is that we're going to want to limit the innings of Martinez – who was a reliever last year – and Wacha – who was shut down for most of last year due to injury – who might be our two best pitchers this year, as well as questions about the health and longevity of Jaime Garcia.

Cardinals,3dhc3u,lostinleft,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:17:11 2015 UTC,Yea thats scary. Especially with no DH.
Cardinals,3dhc3u,meowmeowtits,2,Fri Jul 17 05:01:32 2015 UTC,"I realize he's Joey fucking Votto, but him being a lefty kind of makes me less excited about him. You'd be looking at probably 4 of your first 5 bats being lefties in a lineup at that point (Wong, Marp, Votto, Baeward.) We really need a strong presence from the right side of the plate. We have the good problem of our best RH bench bat (Grich) playing his way into the lineup, and the bad problem of our other (Reynolds,) being in the lineup.   Votto also has Matt Adams' Disease, just taking the walk (not so much with Madams) and singling primarily. We need a bat that might miss more, but would clear the bases, IMO."
Cardinals,3dhc3u,Taber76,3,Thu Jul 16 17:49:43 2015 UTC,"Votto's ISO is better this year than any Cardinals starter.  Only Grichuk has a better mark, in a hair under half of the PAs."

Cardinals,3dhc3u,zaphod_85,2,Fri Jul 17 11:07:14 2015 UTC,Just kuhanluke up to his normal shenanigans
Cardinals,3dhc3u,zaphod_85,2,Fri Jul 17 11:07:00 2015 UTC,Votto's contract is ridiculous.  They couldn't give him away.
Cardinals,3dhc3u,mehx1000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:53:40 2015 UTC,Oh God I would kill for Votto. One of my favorite batters.   Carp-Holliday-Votto would be sick.  Hard to imagine it happens within the division but we can dream.
Cardinals,3dhc3u,CatzonVinyl,3,Thu Jul 16 14:44:17 2015 UTC,What would you give up for him? I want him on the Cardinals too haha
Cardinals,3dhc3u,bravo_delta,2,Thu Jul 16 14:45:03 2015 UTC,"My gut is that he'd be expensive, but his age/contract and the Reds suckiness stifle his trade value a bit.  Right now our top prospects are Marco and Piscotty, and if they want one that needs to be the most of the deal.   Not preferred though. This is a spot where I'd use Reyes and hope they're not expecting MLB ready talent. Give em Adams, and maybe Grichuk and maybe try to get Hoover if it feels unbalanced."
Cardinals,3dhc3u,CatzonVinyl,3,Thu Jul 16 14:54:49 2015 UTC,I could live just fine with that actually.
Cardinals,3dhc3u,bravo_delta,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:44:14 2015 UTC,Oh yeah if I'm guaging the cost right I'd do it in an instant
Cardinals,3dhc3u,CatzonVinyl,3,Thu Jul 16 19:04:38 2015 UTC,I could deal. Think the FO would want to take on the contract though?
Cardinals,3dhc3u,XC_Stallion92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:38:53 2015 UTC,Maybe. I think we have the money and Vottos skill set is one I believe will age quite well
Cardinals,3dhc3u,CatzonVinyl,2,Thu Jul 16 19:03:47 2015 UTC,"See Heyward is a big question mark for us long term. If we don't sign him, then we need to savor Piscotty and Grich.  I think everything depends on how much contract would get eaten."
Cardinals,3dhc3u,meowmeowtits,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:47:31 2015 UTC,"I'd probably do Piscotty/Bourjos/Kaminsky and a PTBNL, but since we're giving up two of our top prospects, I'd hope for a little financial relief, but maybe I'm overvaluing Kaminsky idk."
Cardinals,3dhc3u,DontGiveUpTheDip,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:00:28 2015 UTC,I'd say giving them both Reyes and Kaminsky would be worth some cash.
Cardinals,3dhc3u,CatzonVinyl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:37:46 2015 UTC,"Our outfield just went from stellar to nothing with that. Heyward isn't locked down.  A 2016 potential outfield of Holliday, Jay, Grichuk. With Pham as the one sub.  Holliday aging. Jay a big ? and on the downslope. Grich another big ?."
Cardinals,3dhc3u,meowmeowtits,2,Fri Jul 17 03:50:01 2015 UTC,Yet if we resign Heyward we'd still have a very capable OF of JHey-Grichuk-Holliday
Cardinals,3dhc3u,DontGiveUpTheDip,3,Fri Jul 17 03:52:22 2015 UTC,"Carp-Votto-Holliday, I'd say. And then Peralta-Heyward-Grichuk-Wong-Molina or something. I don't know. I really like that lineup. I really REALLY like that lineup. I'm legit erect."
Cardinals,3dhc3u,kuhanluke,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:58:52 2015 UTC,Wong before Grichuk unless you really really care about not bunching lefties
Cardinals,3dhc3u,Davidfreeze,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:13:31 2015 UTC,"Eh, either way would be fine."
Cardinals,3dhc3u,kuhanluke,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:40:06 2015 UTC,"I personally think we should go after a lefty first baseman of some sort but i don't think the options are all that great. Lind would be the guy I go for. I honestly think that too many AL teams are close to the wild card to want to give up much either. That will cause the prices of everyone to go up, especially Lind. Pitching is fine I really don't want to mess with their Mojo especially when we may get Gonzales as backup sometime soon.    The guy I'd like to have if their team goes on a drastic losing streak between now and the deadline is James Loney. He's a good player and can hit pretty well and play every day. We'll see though. Trade deadline is my favorite time of the year."
Cardinals,3dhc3u,fasterdriver,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:08:20 2015 UTC,"Are there any third base options out there, you could move Marp to first if you can get a 3b"
Cardinals,3dhc3u,cats_just_in_space,2,Thu Jul 16 18:09:26 2015 UTC,"Or move another 3B to 1B.  Juan Uribe is a possible target. He's hitting .290/.351/.478 for Atlanta on the last year of a contract he signed with LA  and has played a little bit of 1B (16 innings in 2013). He could also play MIF in a pinch (came up as a SS, made a start at 2B this year)."
Cardinals,3dhc3u,kuhanluke,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:59:15 2015 UTC,"First base is probably top priority.  I don't think the Cardinals go looking for a bullpen arm with Walden due back.  I could see them grabbed a starter out of the bargain bin (in trade cost) for innings but who knows there.  It sucks that the most obvious trade target, Adam Lind, is in the division."
Cardinals,3dhc3u,D33GS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:54:25 2015 UTC,"we've traded with the brewers before, so its not TOO far fetched."
Cardinals,3dhc3u,reallifebadass,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:11:58 2015 UTC,"Even with Holliday and Adams back the Cards could use another real power hitter, I don't know how realistic that is, I'd expect them to get a pitcher before a hitter. With Garcia not being able to stay healthy I'd think they have to get a pitcher for sure. Not sure if they'd go for a high profile guy like Hamels or Cueto, but more realistically someone who could eat innings(like mentioned above) like Samardzija or Kazmir. They have some young OF talents and Bourjos they could part with."
Cardinals,3dhc3u,JRLiquidCrystal,-8,Fri Jul 17 05:30:59 2015 UTC,"Kozma and Piscotty for Emilio Bonifacio.  Bonifacio has played like one game at 1B, but plays all the other infield and outfield positions and can switch hit..."
Cardinals,3dhc3u,PAJW,10,Thu Jul 16 12:52:06 2015 UTC,"You know he's batting .159 with only 78 PAs this year, right? And you know that Piscotty is like our #2-3 prospect, right?"
Cardinals,3dhc3u,DontGiveUpTheDip,6,Thu Jul 16 16:02:31 2015 UTC,lol
Cardinals,3dhc3u,kuhanluke,2,Thu Jul 16 20:59:53 2015 UTC,"Fuck that man, Piscotty is one of our best prospects"

Cardinals,3ddwig,shoop36,2,Thu Jul 16 01:13:07 2015 UTC,"The thing is that every mod has the intention of doing that, but it becomes a nuisance (of sorts) to actually keep doing day after day. I'm sure /u/kuhanluke /u/evanb_ /u/JohnnyMotif and /u/bravo_delta would love to update it daily, but they also have lives and it isn't like it is not available in a million other places. It is the type of thing that is easy to forget or overlook or whatever and if I'm not mistaking bravo was originally made a mod just to update things like that regularly but like I said it just gets overlooked and there is no intention of automating the process.  People need to accept that things will never be perfect here or anywhere else and to double check another source. It isn't like it hasn't been updated all year or all month. They just lag behind a lot of the time but the point is that that is okay."

Cardinals,3ddwg2,LMac8806,28,Wed Jul 15 14:42:29 2015 UTC,Royals fans are less bearable than Cubs fans. At least Cubs fans are loyal.
Cardinals,3ddwg2,Sinisterminister77,16,Wed Jul 15 15:40:30 2015 UTC,I'm not sure who has the most crybabys though. Both of their fanbases suck. At least Cubs fans have always been around. Most Royals fans didn't even exist prior to October 2014.
Cardinals,3ddwg2,RushLimbaughIsFat,4,Wed Jul 15 19:14:09 2015 UTC,The crybaby award has to go to the Royals.  Even their pitching staff gets mad and cries when a line drive is hit back up the middle.
Cardinals,3ddwg2,Dustinss5,21,Wed Jul 15 21:47:31 2015 UTC,"I moved to NWMO in 2004. I had been living in Texas and followed the Rangers, but with the A-Rod situation down there, I was ready to follow a new team. The Royals didn't seem to give a damn, and I could catch Cardinals games on local radio, so I started following them.  A guy I worked with was a huge Royals fan. He'd always bitch and moan about the '85 series, how the Cardinals were cheaters, bought off the umps, etc. It took me a while to realize the Royals won that game and the series.  I still don't know what his problem was."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,LarryBirds33rdFan,11,Wed Jul 15 16:52:47 2015 UTC,"You know how I can immediately tell when someone doesn't know shit about baseball?  When they play the ""umps were bought"" card."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,justmovingtheground,7,Wed Jul 15 20:05:58 2015 UTC,Especially in a series where one of the biggest blown calls ever by an ump went AGAINST the Cardinals...
Cardinals,3ddwg2,Bskrilla,2,Thu Jul 16 15:19:58 2015 UTC,"I have literally never heard the argument that the Cardinals benefited from the umps in that series.  Any time they talk about it on TV they NEVER mention any calls that went against the Royals, ousually only talk about the Don Denkinger call that cost the Cardinals the series."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,dquizzle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:32:48 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I don't know what his problem was. I usually tuned him out when he started talking baseball. The guy was a die-hard Royals fan. He had a big poster of George Brett going bananas after the pine-tar-on-the-bat incident."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,LarryBirds33rdFan,12,Fri Jul 17 17:15:06 2015 UTC,"Royals fans just have a lot of pent up energy and trash talking in them. It's like not teaching a 16 year old any cuss words and then suddenly unleashing a whole list of them on him. I think the rivalry will calm down and be more cordial if the royals stay competitive for a while, but right now they don't know how to trash talk and be competitive without being bitches about it. I think you'll see this more from some cubs fans next season too."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,kwking13,12,Wed Jul 15 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"Cards fan who lives in KC here. It's insane, I've been cussed at for wearing my Cards hat to Kauffman Stadium.   I am a Royals fan as long as they aren't playing the red birds.  Hell I go to far more Royals games than Cards every year but the hatred I see is palpable.  There is also, what appears to me, to be a one sided rivalry.  Royals fans tell me all about a hardcore rivalry that i wasn't aware existed until I moved here."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,gx1400,3,Wed Jul 15 17:47:07 2015 UTC,"You have exactly my same sentiments. I didn't know about this ""rivalry"" until 1997-98 when I moved to KC. When I explain how one sided it is to KC fans, they never believe me. I had to stop going to the cards games in KC, douchebaggery abounds from both team's fans, I just can't take it anymore."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,acepiloto,10,Thu Jul 16 13:54:35 2015 UTC,All of those insufferable Chiefs fans have to cheer for somebody in the offseason.
Cardinals,3ddwg2,DesignatedDecoy,8,Wed Jul 15 15:49:31 2015 UTC,"For me I can't really stand the Royals. Maybe it's because I'm not from Missouri and I don't live there so I don't care if the succeed or not.   I didn't care either way for them last year, even though their fans were kind of annoying. This year however I just can't stand them or their fans."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,guluru,4,Wed Jul 15 15:24:25 2015 UTC,"I can understand that, in particular from non-Missouri Cardinal fans.   Also, I can kind of get not liking their fans in general, considering the Royals were nobody only a few short years ago, and now it feels like some of them think they're a dynasty or the greatest thing in the league right now."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,rapeymcslapnuts,7,Wed Jul 15 15:26:34 2015 UTC,My cousin is a Royals fan. He swore that he hated professional baseball his whole life and then just last year became a huge fan. I wear my Cardinals hat every time I go visit him just to piss him off.
Cardinals,3ddwg2,CountChoculahh,4,Wed Jul 15 20:34:11 2015 UTC,Cards fan currently living in KC. I just don't get it. Seems like the kid that was a reject throughout middle school becomes a popular kid in HS and becomes an asshole. No explanation but years of bitterness and losing.
Cardinals,3ddwg2,MudButtMcGrutt,4,Wed Jul 15 17:34:52 2015 UTC,"Moved to KC 7 years ago.  Every year, including this one, they seem to be more concerned about the Cardinals losing than the Royals winning.  They were unbearable in post seasons past (with people clapping in your face any time a team scored a run against the Cards), and were absolutely miserable to watch any games with last October."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,belgarion90,7,Wed Jul 15 19:45:38 2015 UTC,Bandwagons on both sides are the issue.
Cardinals,3ddwg2,cptzanzibar,7,Wed Jul 15 14:46:00 2015 UTC,"That's a shame really. This should be a pretty friendly rivalry. We only meet a few times a year, we never actually compete for anything unless it's in the World Series."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,mike_rotch22,3,Wed Jul 15 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"I havent had many issues with them at all. In fact, I had a chat with a Royals fan when I was in a layover in Atl just a few weeks ago. He was all about having an I70 series and the Cards are his NL team. He was talking up Wong like crazy, he really likes him apparently, lol."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,TheKornManCan,3,Wed Jul 15 16:23:52 2015 UTC,"They have basically played little brother to the Cardinals since 1985. I went to college at Truman State, and it seemed like at least 30% of the population was from St. Louis or eastern Missouri, at least 30% was from KC or western Missouri, so I saw a lot of the animosity. While KC was trying to avoid losing 100 games a season, the Cardinals were annually in the post-season.  I used to drive out to KC with a fraternity brother every summer to watch Cardinals/Royals games, and while the majority of the fans were fine and polite, there were a few dickholsters who did everything to make our visit unpleasant. Bringing up 1985 to no end, etc.  Still, I've found the vocal ones to be a minority for the most part. And certainly we have our share of jerks as well. But if you want to see why they don't like us, just check our team records for the last 30 years."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,saxmachinejoe,5,Wed Jul 15 17:46:54 2015 UTC,"I currently go to Truman and holy crap, last October, all these Royals fans came out of nowhere. They were complete assholes and made fun of the Cardinals for not making it to the World Series. (Winning eight straight playoff games will do that to ya). When they lost the World Series, I legitimately tried comforting a friend, he said, ""You have no idea what it's like."" Little does he know, I've been alive long enough to see the Cards both win two World Series and lose two. I wanted the Royals to do well at the beginning, but by the end of October, I was fed up with the Royals."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,BetterThanAFoon,5,Wed Jul 15 19:59:59 2015 UTC,"Slightly on topic mini rant:  I can't stand KC fans. I'm a Mizzou grad, I know plenty of people from KC and they are good people and fun to be around until at a sporting event. In my experience, the people that refuse to acknowledge great plays made by the opposing team or worse, boo our players when aren't doing well(something that, in my opinion should never happen outside of someone being an unsportsmanlike scumbag) are generally people from KC.  The thing that grinds my gears more than anything though is the ""Chiefs"" shout at the end of the National Anthem(home of the CHIEFS!). I know we do it at Blues games but until I went to a Blues game I didn't know anyone did and I've never heard it outside of a hockey game. You're at a MU basketball game, not a Chiefs football game, you don't need to destroy the Star Spangled Banner any more than that god-awful singer just did. I live in Texas now and went to a Springfield Cardinals - San Antonio Missions game recently. Some girls from a local church sang the Anthem quite well to my relief but when they got to the last verse we heard ""O're the land of the Free, and the home of the CHIEEEEEEEFS!"" Dammit. I turned around and saw the culprit in a Royals t-shirt. You are 800 miles from KC. Ugh. /rant"
Cardinals,3ddwg2,DiscoJer,2,Thu Jul 16 03:20:26 2015 UTC,Let me link you to a similar discussion from a few weeks ago.
Cardinals,3ddwg2,dumonsl,3,Fri Jul 17 17:46:34 2015 UTC,"If you check their attendance, you'll see most of them are bandwagoners.  They didn't even start going to games until last last year.  Also, for some reason, KC tends to have an inferiority complex when it comes to St. Louis."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,ttthhhhppppptt,3,Wed Jul 15 22:01:04 2015 UTC,Sort of like St. Louis generally has an inferiority complex when it comes to Chicago.  Because in both cases the rest of the county isn't entirely sure what state the city is in.
Cardinals,3ddwg2,fasterdriver,2,Wed Jul 15 22:46:23 2015 UTC,eh--Assholes are general across humanity.  Plenty of Cardinals fans are assholes too.
Cardinals,3ddwg2,jopjor,8,Wed Jul 15 16:52:53 2015 UTC,"Sure, they are, I don't disagree. But the general attitude among Royals fans (at least on reddit, ESPN, Facebook, etc.) that I see is ""fuck the Cardinals."" We get along better with some teams who ought to be pissed at us for beating them in the division or LCS year after year."
Cardinals,3ddwg2,hate4dayz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:55:26 2015 UTC,I noticed this as well. They not be used to their newfound success yet.

Cardinals,3ddjv5,Minnesota_Slim,24,Wed Jul 15 12:50:52 2015 UTC,Remember last year how much shit Waino and Cardinals fans got around /r/baseball from Dodgers fans because he got the start over Kershaw.  Seeing Grienke + Kershaw give up 3. Priceless.
Cardinals,3ddjv5,reallifebadass,17,Wed Jul 15 14:32:40 2015 UTC,Kershaw is in playoff form already
Cardinals,3ddjv5,RushLimbaughIsFat,5,Wed Jul 15 18:16:45 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Greinke was rolling after he gave up the homerun to Trout. But Martinez should have pitched over Kershaw seeing as how Martinez won the final vote."
Cardinals,3ddjv5,lostinleft,3,Wed Jul 15 19:20:34 2015 UTC,^ That is both an outstanding comment and observation.
Cardinals,3ddjv5,mild_resolve,2,Wed Jul 15 19:15:22 2015 UTC,I remember Waino got a lot of shit because he said he grooved pitches to Jeter.
Cardinals,3ddjv5,huanthewolfhound,11,Wed Jul 15 20:17:01 2015 UTC,All I can really say about last night's game is that it was slightly amusing how things change within a year: Last year the Cardinals pitchers were getting ragged on for giving up runs to the AL. This year it was partially on the Dodgers pitchers.  Basic conclusion: Kershaw is not quite Sandy II this year.
Cardinals,3ddjv5,Fluteloop1,10,Wed Jul 15 14:12:42 2015 UTC,"AW, my daughter turned 5 today!! We're going to buy her a big girl bike this morning and then party later."

Cardinals,3ddjv5,hail_satan666,9,Wed Jul 15 17:01:16 2015 UTC,Had that meeting with my boss after work. Instead of going to the field I'm in chickasha at the courthouse doing research.   My boss is talking to the coworker this morning. Pretty much told him it's at the point where I don't want to come to work because of said coworker. He didn't like hearing that. So it'll be interesting to see how my coworker takes his talk with the boss.   Edit: Looks like he unfriended me on Facebook. ;-;

Cardinals,3ddjv5,hail_satan666,2,Wed Jul 15 13:56:16 2015 UTC,Me too. I'm sure he'll call me a pussy ass bitch and stuff though.
Cardinals,3ddjv5,F117Nighthawk,4,Wed Jul 15 14:11:18 2015 UTC,The real pussy ass bitch is the grown man who is a verbally abusive dick to his coworker. I'll fight him for you.
Cardinals,3ddjv5,hail_satan666,3,Wed Jul 15 16:31:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm curious to know what he and the boss talked about. I'm wondering if I'm going to the field and working with him today. That may be awkward.
Cardinals,3ddjv5,SouthpawRage,2,Wed Jul 15 16:37:13 2015 UTC,The boss or the bitch-ass coworker unfriended you?
Cardinals,3ddjv5,hail_satan666,2,Wed Jul 15 17:18:33 2015 UTC,Coworker.
Cardinals,3ddjv5,SouthpawRage,2,Wed Jul 15 17:43:22 2015 UTC,Hopefully he quit then.
Cardinals,3ddjv5,hail_satan666,3,Wed Jul 15 17:53:40 2015 UTC,Nah he didn't. I did get my ass chewed out by the boss. Mostly for being on my phone when we're in the truck. Which I understand because I should be paying attention and trying to learn stuff. As he put it I've plataued and am in a comfort zone and I can see why said coworker was being short with me.   TL;DR I brought it upon myself somewhat.
Cardinals,3ddjv5,SouthpawRage,2,Wed Jul 15 17:59:28 2015 UTC,Doesn't mean coworker has to be a dick.  Hopefully things get better!
Cardinals,3ddjv5,hail_satan666,3,Wed Jul 15 18:01:59 2015 UTC,True. I'm going to talk to him when I get dropped off at the job with the GPS. Try to clear the air a bit.
Cardinals,3ddjv5,SouthpawRage,2,Wed Jul 15 18:04:33 2015 UTC,"Good Luck! Never easy trying to reason with the unreasonable, but hopefully you can get to a place where you can at least work together peaceably."

I'd say I still have a hard time understanding hate for a team just because they are good to the point you boo a guy like CarMart or Wacha. But that's just me.  Yadi handled it beautifully. Pujols joined in which was great because it obviously mocks the Reds. Our boys ""retaliated"" in the best way possible by performing well, and proudly representing us Cards.  But yeah, I am gonna say it was classless to boo like that. If it was at Busch, I'd expect better of my fellow fans."

I think the guys probably really enjoyed it, especially after watching the video again.  I'm just more butthurt over the fact that AJ Burnett, Wacha, nor CarMart got in the game.  It's not Bochy's fault necessarily, but the fact that the stupid game 'matters' and he can't burn through everyone giving them a chance to be in the game."
Cardinals,3ddjv5,solarmama,7,Wed Jul 15 14:19:08 2015 UTC,"I was at the All-Star game in St. Louis, 2009 I think. The lone Cub was booed by the crowd, he just laughed.

No matter who is right or wrong (if there's such a thing), the admins have terribly broken the trust of a large chunk of users. I'm not sure if there's a way to get that back, and it doesn't bode well for future policy changes. Continue avoiding large subreddits. Reddit was so much more fun when I was just using it for /r/Minecraft, back in the day!"

Cardinals,3dfu8z,cmyersavi,6,Wed Jul 15 23:01:20 2015 UTC,"I really don't care that our pitchers got extra rest. The fact that they made the all star game will be what we remember in 10 years, not the 15-20 pitches the pitched in some random ass inning of the 2014 all star game."
Cardinals,3dfu8z,yung_iron,4,Thu Jul 16 07:24:26 2015 UTC,At least both our representing hitters got on base for a perfect 1.000.
Cardinals,3dfu8z,shane201,8,Thu Jul 16 01:50:44 2015 UTC,"Get over it.  ""Michael Wacha and Carlos Martinez weren’t called upon as manager Bruce Bochy said he was saving them for extra innings.  If Cardinals manager Mike Matheny had sent a case of champagne to Bochy, it couldn’t have worked out any better, except for that home field thing, as he tries to protect his three valued young arms."" Source"
Cardinals,3dfu8z,VanHicklestein,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:12:01 2015 UTC,"They are apparently on an innings limit this year, so you really should be pleased about it., because that's just one more inning they get to pitching in actually meaningful games."
Cardinals,3dfu8z,dquizzle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:55:17 2015 UTC,"I'm just glad that they 1) got more rest, and 2) can now get a cool star tattoo like Yadi's.  Also, I'm pretty sure Bruce Bochy has plenty of respect for the Cardinals."
Cardinals,3dfu8z,MommaCatPat,0,Fri Jul 17 06:42:11 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, this works out better for the team anyway. These guys are young and its better that they're saving their pitches for games that matter.   But even if that wasn't the case, there is no question that Kershaw is a much better pitcher. The fan vote is a joke and shouldn't decide who the manager puts in the game and who sits out. The fact that Kershaw was only at the game due to an injury is should tell you all you need to know about the fan vote. It's really sad."
Cardinals,3dfu8z,Jumanji-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:23:01 2015 UTC,"Well... Kershaw also didn't get a player/manager selection, for what that's worth."
Cardinals,3dbidf,MattAdams53,7,Wed Jul 15 00:02:15 2015 UTC,"For those that are frustrated or feel that someone got slighted or just don't like how the thing was set up: it's just a made-up contest that has no real bearing on anything, created to sell ad space and generate some publicity. It'll be okay, folks."
Cardinals,3dbidf,TheCarrzilico,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:12:47 2015 UTC,"Go Crazy, Folks! Go Crazy! It's a snubbing...of the wizard!"
Cardinals,3dbidf,WhuddaWhat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:12:07 2015 UTC,It's a snubbing of Albert Pujols. Him and the three up there are better than Ozzie or Brock.
Cardinals,3dbidf,kuhanluke,11,Thu Jul 16 18:59:08 2015 UTC,How not Pujols. He was the face of this organization for 10 great years?
Cardinals,3dbidf,Asiandud3606,4,Wed Jul 15 00:09:20 2015 UTC,I voted for not active players but had Ozzie instead of Brock.
Cardinals,3dbidf,apiratewithadd,9,Wed Jul 15 03:45:01 2015 UTC,Idiot votes with an ax to grind.
Cardinals,3dbidf,DiscoJer,3,Wed Jul 15 00:10:48 2015 UTC,"Because he left to take slightly more money (not even that considering taxes) to play for another team? And signed a personal services contract so he's basically never going to be able to appear as a Cardinal once he retires (that's what makes me angry, him signing that. He cut pre-emptively ties with the organization after his career, not the organization).  And beyond that, 3 of those 4 guys are simply better. And while Brock isn't, he's notable for being the 2nd best base stealer ever."
Cardinals,3dbidf,kuhanluke,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:46:51 2015 UTC,"It's the St. Louis Cardinals. We shouldn't reward a guy just for being the second greatest at one thing. If Rickey hadn't shattered the record, it would be one thing; he'd be the greatest base stealer of all time. But he isn't. Rickey is. Meanwhile, Albert Pujols is the second-best first baseman of all-time by WAR, behind only Lou Gehrig."
Cardinals,3dbidf,D33GS,2,Thu Jul 16 19:06:57 2015 UTC,I thought excluding Pujols was fair.  He hasn't even retired yet and currently plays for another team.  Maybe in 10 years when he retires but not now.
Cardinals,3dbidf,SaulGibson,2,Wed Jul 15 04:44:47 2015 UTC,I don't think the Angels organization would like that very much.
Cardinals,3dbidf,Asiandud3606,5,Wed Jul 15 00:16:23 2015 UTC,I don't care what the angel organization thinks about it. If they did not want that to be a possibility they would of left him off the ballet.
Cardinals,3dbidf,Wifflebald,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:27:07 2015 UTC,"We should love them. They let Eckstein and Spiezio go, clearly with us acquiring and winning a world series with them in mind."
Cardinals,3dbidf,kuhanluke,2,Wed Jul 15 03:40:52 2015 UTC,They also gave us Jim Edmonds for basically nothing and gave us future hall of famer Randal Grichuk.
Cardinals,3dbidf,olipoo,5,Thu Jul 16 19:07:42 2015 UTC,4 is hardly a baseball number. 4 isn't nearly enough to describe this franchise.
Cardinals,3dbidf,studoggery,26,Wed Jul 15 01:15:35 2015 UTC,Should have been franchise six because six is a serious number
Cardinals,3dbidf,jaredshane,2,Wed Jul 15 01:20:15 2015 UTC,gah you beat me to it.
Cardinals,3dbidf,jaredshane,6,Wed Jul 15 01:26:28 2015 UTC,but 6.......6 is a serious number.
Cardinals,3dbidf,olipoo,3,Wed Jul 15 01:26:14 2015 UTC,Actually...
Cardinals,3dbidf,Dgb7bf,2,Wed Jul 15 01:16:32 2015 UTC,sure. not what i meant. why not choose all time Nines instead?
Cardinals,3dbidf,Jblumhorst,3,Wed Jul 15 01:17:56 2015 UTC,I think they went with 4 because it is kind of like a Mount Rushmore for every team and also a few teams might have a hard time putting 9 GREAT players that would deserve being on the lists.
Cardinals,3dbidf,Rockmanll,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:12:59 2015 UTC,"I was kidding, but yeah. that would make more sense."
Cardinals,3dbidf,frakking-anustart,20,Wed Jul 15 01:23:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah for Hornsby, should be Ozzie or Pujols in for Brock though."
Cardinals,3dbidf,burts_beads,4,Wed Jul 15 00:02:46 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with the four, Ozzie makes the top 4 if he plays for most other teams, it's just the Cardinals have a stacked franchise.  I'd be interested to see how many of the players with 3000+ hits made it to their respective team while Jeter (3,465 6th all-time) didn't.  But nobody can complain with Di Maggio, Ruth, Gehrig, and Mantle.  Cardinals and Yankees just have too many alumni."
Cardinals,3dbidf,Maverick814,6,Wed Jul 15 00:54:38 2015 UTC,"9 of 29 3k+ hit members missed  Derek Jeter (Yankees, 1995-2014)  Cap Anson (Cubs, 1876-1897)  Eddie Collins (White Sox, 1915-1926)  Eddie Murray (Orioles, 1977-1988)  Nap Lajoie (Indians, 1902-1914)  Paul Waner (Pirates, 1926-1940)  Rafael Palmeiro (Rangers, 1989-1993, 1999-2003)  Alex Rodriguez (Yankees, 2004-Now)  Wade Boggs (Red Sox, 1982-1992)"
Cardinals,3dbidf,burts_beads,2,Wed Jul 15 02:18:36 2015 UTC,Eddie Collins not being in ours is dumb.
Cardinals,3dbidf,faerieswing,8,Wed Jul 15 03:43:19 2015 UTC,I love Brock but he routinely gets put in higher regard than he should.
Cardinals,3dbidf,btownbomb,7,Wed Jul 15 00:47:12 2015 UTC,"Lou Brock is 9th in the Cardinals all time positional WAR leaderboard (not that WAR is everything). He is below names like Ted Simmons, Curt Flood, and Ken Boyer.  Top 4, with pitchers included, is Musial, Hornsby, Pujols, Gibson."
Cardinals,3dbidf,mfranko88,5,Wed Jul 15 02:04:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and a lot of that is longevity (that definitely is important) but his peak was weak and was more of a one-trick-pony for the most part. It's frustrating, there are better players to honor."

Cardinals,3dbidf,msoverby10,3,Wed Jul 15 19:15:08 2015 UTC,"i get why they went with ""franchise four"" (alliterations are awesome) but man, i wanted five just so ozzie could be added.  edit: i just realized five also starts with the letter f  MAKE THIS HAPPEN MLB"
Cardinals,3dbidf,TweetPoster,3,Wed Jul 15 04:46:34 2015 UTC,You also get the half-rhyme with franchise and five.
Cardinals,3dbidf,NorwegianWood28,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:15:08 2015 UTC,"Five would be perfect for the Cards cause then you include Ozzie and Pujols instead of having to debate them.  Sorry Lou, you just don't belong on this list."

Cardinals,3dbw6v,Vocal_Antagonist,7,Wed Jul 15 02:37:56 2015 UTC,"He gave them that 'oh, you like me now?' eye roll which translates to 'Fuck you, Cincinnati' in Spanish I believe."

Cardinals,3daqy9,Salesman89,9,Tue Jul 14 20:59:10 2015 UTC,Sucks but he has been giving up  hits.  I'd rather have him take a few days off and get healthy than throw an inning in the all star game.
Cardinals,3daqy9,wh11,9,Tue Jul 14 21:17:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't care about the ASG... I'm worried about us having our closer ready to go for the next game that counts."
Cardinals,3daqy9,Salesman89,4,Tue Jul 14 21:22:53 2015 UTC,"The arm soreness is really from lifting so many plates at the buffet last night, and wouldn't'cha know it, it just feels kinda sore, so I think I'm just gonna go napintheclubhousekthxbai."
Cardinals,3daqy9,letuotter,9,Tue Jul 14 22:32:08 2015 UTC,Hopefully we don't see Wacha and Martinez pitch either.  Rest all our pitching.  They need it.
Cardinals,3daqy9,D33GS,5,Tue Jul 14 22:35:47 2015 UTC,Martinez is also unavailable due to arm soreness. I'm hoping these are both just excuses to get them rest and not legitimate.  Edit: Pretty sure I was mistaken
Cardinals,3daqy9,Birdsonbat,2,Tue Jul 14 22:55:48 2015 UTC,Really? Carmart is the player I was most excited to watch in the game.
Cardinals,3daqy9,crackalac,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:44:18 2015 UTC,Where did you read that? I read that Bochy told him to be ready if the game goes into extras
Cardinals,3daqy9,evan1123,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:42:55 2015 UTC,I might have been mistaken. I saw an update on my phone that I thought said Martinez was unavailable due to right arm soreness. I must have misread the update on Rosie because I can't find anything about CarMart. My bad.
Cardinals,3daqy9,Birdsonbat,5,Tue Jul 14 23:47:21 2015 UTC,"After listening to bochy when interviewed about this subject, it seems like Mike asked Bruce not to use him."
Cardinals,3daqy9,crackalac,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:43:08 2015 UTC,best news I've heard in days  assuming of course it's not real arm soreness. but it's gotta be bullshit right?
Cardinals,3daqy9,flagamuffin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:04:50 2015 UTC,I am 100% ok with this. I would be happy if all of our pitchers stated on the bench. I just want us to get healthy and refocus on the 2nd half.

Cardinals,3d8wtm,gotsnow,23,Tue Jul 14 13:48:30 2015 UTC,I think he gets fired up about literally everything having to do with a team atmosphere.

Cardinals,3d8wtm,SineMetu_spqr,13,Tue Jul 14 21:28:22 2015 UTC,Cardinals batting 1.000 tonight and our pitchers have pitched for a combined ERA of zero.   Mean while no dodgers have gotten on base and pitched for a combined ERA of 9.   Edit: changed .1000 to 1.000
Cardinals,3d8wtm,DontGiveUpTheDip,11,Wed Jul 15 02:46:28 2015 UTC,"So the TSwift concert was amazing last night. She actually seems like one of the most genuine people ever.   Plus, she surprised everyone by having Lorde show up. It was insane."
Cardinals,3d8wtm,ashlicrowe,8,Tue Jul 14 13:18:14 2015 UTC,Lorde was tweeting about that. Their friendship is the weirdest/cutest thing ever.
Cardinals,3d8wtm,DontGiveUpTheDip,3,Tue Jul 14 13:29:24 2015 UTC,"Haha yea it was awesome. She flew out all the way from Australia to do that. Tatlor has had special guests in all of her concerts this tour. She just had Nick Jonas, the US wome a soccer team, and VS Angels in her past three shows hah"
Cardinals,3d8wtm,GoSomaliPirates,2,Tue Jul 14 13:37:28 2015 UTC,I agree. I went to the Red tour in Kansas City a couple years ago. It was a ton of fun
Cardinals,3d8wtm,readermom,10,Tue Jul 14 13:37:22 2015 UTC,How does Kershaw get to pitch when the only reason he is here is because someone dropped out and we have 2 pitchers that were chosen to be here and they don't get to pitch at all.     I don't understand.
Cardinals,3d8wtm,scruubb,5,Wed Jul 15 03:19:24 2015 UTC,And with our catcher behind the plate--so you don't get those unfamiliar battery combinations. But now we lose on Kershaw. Of course.
Cardinals,3d8wtm,readermom,6,Wed Jul 15 03:20:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was expecting Wacha to come in with Molina behind the plate.  That would have been cool."
Cardinals,3d8wtm,gotsnow,8,Wed Jul 15 03:23:33 2015 UTC,"Red went under the knife again yesterday. Now, he has no eyes. He still thinks he's tough and can be my daughter's guard dog. She just wants to decorate his cone with Lisa Frank stickers. He will lose this battle.   On a side note, a guy I've known my entire life played in the celebrity all-star softball game last night as one of the wounded warriors. It was really awesome to see him playing outfield with Snoop Dogg on national TV."
Cardinals,3d8wtm,SouthpawRage,5,Tue Jul 14 12:52:29 2015 UTC,Tim Horton? He made some good plays!
Cardinals,3d8wtm,gotsnow,7,Tue Jul 14 14:27:59 2015 UTC,Yep!   He's always been a hell of an athlete. His mom posted a picture of him with Snoop on Facebook a couple days ago. Looks like they bonded well in Cincinnati.
Cardinals,3d8wtm,huanthewolfhound,2,Tue Jul 14 14:49:58 2015 UTC,"Snoop was mic'd up while playing the outfield next to Horton and was cheering him on every time the ball went toward left field, which happened a lot last night. I didn't even notice his leg until he came up to bat late in the game."
Cardinals,3d8wtm,gotsnow,5,Tue Jul 14 15:32:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw that! That was so cool! He moves so well for having a prosthetic leg. I want to say he lost it about 9 years ago, he got hit by an IED. He had to have a lot of surgery on his face too. I remember hanging out with him at a wedding reception not too long after he got his new leg and he kept stepping on my feet (I was wearing flip flops) with it. And it really hurt. We may or may not have been inebriated."
Cardinals,3d8wtm,SouthpawRage,3,Tue Jul 14 15:37:08 2015 UTC,"I actually Googled him as I was watching the game, because they mentioned his name a few times and there were a lot of the Legends/Celebrities that I didn't now. I thought he was just an actor that I didn't know, but nope one of the Wounded Warriors. That's pretty cool!"
Cardinals,3d8wtm,gotsnow,3,Tue Jul 14 15:27:29 2015 UTC,He's a great guy. I have a lot of stories growing up with him and his brothers.
Cardinals,3d8wtm,ashlicrowe,3,Tue Jul 14 15:39:33 2015 UTC,"If I had a cone, I would want it decorated in Lisa Frank stickers."
Cardinals,3d8wtm,gotsnow,3,Tue Jul 14 13:26:40 2015 UTC,"The Dollar General in my parent's dinky ass hometown carries an ample supply of Lisa Frank sticker books. My daughter owns every one of them along with just about every other shit quality toy the Dollar General offers because my father doesn't know how to say no to her. I guess being the only grandchild has its perks. Also, my dad is total fucking pushover."
Cardinals,3d8wtm,ashlicrowe,4,Tue Jul 14 13:34:24 2015 UTC,Lucky girl. Leo is the only grandchild and my dad won't even recognize his existence. I'm not sure he's looked at him since he's been born.
Cardinals,3d8wtm,gotsnow,2,Tue Jul 14 13:41:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds like his loss.   If it's any consolation, Remi's dad hasn't looked at her or acknowledged her existence since June of 2010, when she was 13 months old."
Cardinals,3d8wtm,1859,9,Tue Jul 14 13:59:35 2015 UTC,"Look at this! That's PLUTO! Today is so surreal for me. I've always been a massive astronomy nerd, and followed New Horizons since before it was launched. I've been waiting ten years for this moment, and I'm absolutely giddy to see such a detailed picture for the first time. It's gorgeous!"

Cardinals,3d8wtm,SouthpawRage,2,Tue Jul 14 15:39:46 2015 UTC,It's so weird to me that we didn't have a detailed photo of Pluto until now.  Aside: Pluto was only considered a planet for 76 years? It's crazy to me to think that we didn't even know it was out there until 1930...
Cardinals,3d8wtm,1859,3,Tue Jul 14 16:24:19 2015 UTC,"Even crazier to me: the 11 year old girl who named Pluto lived long enough to see its planetary status removed, and to see New Horizons' launch."
Cardinals,3d8wtm,DlSCOSTU,2,Tue Jul 14 16:28:23 2015 UTC,"Looks like a planet to me.   Plus, ""My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine"" is a fragment. Give us the ""Pizzas""!  PlutoForPlanet2015"

You'd have about 18 instead, with a C, V, P, and H after Mars for Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea in the asteroid belt. By now, you'd have to add at least 1 new word to the mnemonic every year because we keep finding more trans-Neptunian objects that are close to Pluto's size, some even larger."

I mean, yes, super cool--the whole mission is amazing, in fact--but I had to remind everyone that I couldn't get that excited because I wasn't even in high school when they made the part."
Cardinals,3d8wtm,Michael__Pemulis,10,Wed Jul 15 03:13:55 2015 UTC,I start my new job today.   I'm excited because it is basically the first time I will have a job that I actually want to have.

Cardinals,3d8wtm,DlSCOSTU,3,Tue Jul 14 14:17:24 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! No need for specifics, are you still in ""the business"" as a PA or such?"
Cardinals,3d8wtm,Michael__Pemulis,4,Tue Jul 14 16:22:58 2015 UTC,Unfortunately not really. I would still love to do more set-related work but I just don't have the connections for now. My new job is in the menswear industry.

Cardinals,3d8wtm,huanthewolfhound,11,Tue Jul 14 16:33:33 2015 UTC,"Favorite moments of last night's Celebrity/Legends Softball Game:   Vlad hits a home run, and Snoop ""tries"" to rob him by going over the wall. This was right after Jennie Finch blew one actual fast pitch by him. She should have kept that up. Andy Dalton hit the only ball that actually almost went out of the park. It was hilarious after he had been booed by some of the hometown crowd. Snoop. As in, everything he did. Ozzie and Andre Dawson. Dawson in right-field was a treat, as he made some pretty decent cut off throws. Ozzie was Ozzie."
Cardinals,3d8wtm,dumonsl,2,Tue Jul 14 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"Holy shit.  I wish I'd paid attention to who was playing before the game.  Snoop is a fucking riot, I would have watched just for him.  I work at a University and he played here a few years ago.  He was such an amazing hot mess, and I got to eat sooo muuuccchhhh candy afterward."

Cardinals,3d8wtm,belgarion90,7,Wed Jul 15 03:38:25 2015 UTC,I was rather disappointed in the amount of NL fans happy about losing so the Cardinals won't have HFA.

Cardinals,3d8wtm,solarmama,3,Wed Jul 15 03:51:26 2015 UTC,"clearly they just want A-Rod to hit the WS-clinching walkoff blast in game 6 or 7 at Yankee Stadium, and have one last lap of FORG1V3NESS around the bases as Bud Selig cries enough to flood all of Milwaukee.

I don't know the stats from previous years but he scares me a lot less this year than last year. Last year he seemed to let people on but would still pull it out some home by the skin of his teeth. This years he has been lights out other than a couple bad outings. Once again I don't have the stats on this but that's how I've perceived it atleast. I'm less worried this year than last year about him that's for sure.

I don't expect perfection from anyone, but given the opponent, national audience, etc., this was a total kick in the balls.   All in all, I have to say that PIT fans are pretty dope, btw.

Cardinals,3d3egv,Hellmark,5,Mon Jul 13 15:54:15 2015 UTC,"I've never been a Yankees fan, because of the huge budget they have. They can afford the best of everything. Still, you cannot deny how good they are. Not only do they have some of the best players, but they have incredible coaches who are able to keep the players focused and playing as a team (which can be an incredible feat in and of itself). Quite often when you hear about the super star players, they get full of themselves and are self centered. The Yankees are full of super stars, yet, you really don't hear about that behavior too much.  The other thing I dislike about the Yankees is the random fans that they attract that ordinarily would have no attachment to them. The people from other parts of the country that become ""Yankees fans"" because it seems to be the popular thing to do. Still, can't fault the Yankees about that, since it isn't really something they do. Other sports get that as well. I mean, I remember growing up and seeing the number of Cowboys fans, even though we're no where near Texas, and have our own team and others near by.  EDIT: Spelling correction."

Cardinals,3d3zv4,Michael__Pemulis,3,Mon Jul 13 19:49:05 2015 UTC,The 'almost made it' pitchers generally always get to play in the game because there are a bunch of all stars that pitched yesterday and are therefore not going to pitch two days later.
Cardinals,3d3zv4,readermom,3,Mon Jul 13 19:58:19 2015 UTC,"Then what's the point of the voting?  People were pissed that CMart beat Kershaw and then he's in it anyway?  I guess I don't really care, but it's stupid."
Cardinals,3d3zv4,Michael__Pemulis,2,Mon Jul 13 22:03:38 2015 UTC,Everyone knew Kershaw would more than likely end up getting to play regardless. Voting definitely matters more for the position player guys that only would get the call for an injury to another player.

Nasty things were said, my boyfriend was insulted (I refused to stoop to her level in that department even though it would have been SO EASY) and she ended up blocking my number and profiles everywhere. The only thing that made it slightly easier is that she lived an hour away, so the odds of ever seeing her are slim...  Cutting someone out of your life is a terrible feeling, but sometimes it's for the better. I lost my best friend that day, and I still miss her. But I don't miss her like she is now, I miss the Karen she was in high school. The Karen that got tattoos she regretted, and made me mixed CDs called ""Music that Jessica Would Never Listen To But Karen Is Forcing Her To"", which basically introduced me to alternative rock. The Karen that drove me to football games with our marching band instruments in her shitty Lebaron isn't there anymore. Now she takes every little thing personally, and spews acidic ""religion"" at you when you say things she doesn't agree with.  tl;dr- sometimes who someone used to be isn't worth putting up with who they are now.

Say we're in extras and need a hit to keep the game going. Peralta, who's due up next, is 0-6 on the day. Do you take him out for Kozma/Cruz? No, you give your all-star a chance to make a play."

Cardinals,3d369m,billybonghorton,11,Mon Jul 13 04:20:20 2015 UTC,Well
Cardinals,3d369m,Ivedefected,38,Mon Jul 13 03:52:18 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way. The Pirates are playing their best ball right now. We're playing some of our worst. We have multiple key injuries. We load the bases with an out and maybe we get a run. But STILL, we're pushing them to extras. We could've walked away winning this series in multiple spots.  But our Matts will be back! If they barely beat us at our worst when they are at their best, we can only go up."
Cardinals,3d369m,ShamrockAPD,31,Mon Jul 13 03:53:19 2015 UTC,"Buccos fan here-  I agree, you guys have some serious injuries on your team. Adams is a pirate killer. And hell, these past two days have been the best baseball I've ever watched (keep in mind 20 years of losing seasons under me).  But- we do have key injuries with us too. Harrison is HUGE. He may not be the power hitter Adams is, but he's pretty damn clutch on both sides of ball.  Marte was red hot when he went out- like hitting above 300 hot. He hasn't been the same when he came back. I would argue that he came back too early here.  Either way, what a damn series. This will be intense for sure when we meet again.  Til then, fuck you (and love you for the great rivalry), and let's rest up and be healthy for later"

Big pressure situation and they nutted up and we shit our pants.  Cant get bases loaded with no outs and only score 1. Cant ride Rosie who was overworked already when he's getting his shit stomped. Our bullpen is full of AAA guys.  We are a shattered team limping out a super hot start which thank god we had because we'd be in 3rd place right now.

Cardinals,3d369m,fre1102,2,Mon Jul 13 04:18:49 2015 UTC,"That's sort of what I was thinking--this team has looked very, very much like the pre-April and May 2015 Matheny Cardinals. The find-a-way-to-lose Cardinals. The no-killer-instinct Cardinals. The can't-close Cardinals.  It's getting to be a few weeks, which worries me, but we're looking at a few days off. God willing, Matheny's learned to speak to the team and not just defend them blindly in every instance.   The performance until June shows that the talent is clearly there. Now they just need the leadership to take the best start in baseball and make it the best finish in baseball."

Cardinals,3d369m,D33GS,4,Mon Jul 13 04:13:04 2015 UTC,This game is Exhibit A of the difference between Matheny and La Russa.  La Russa would have had someone ready the instant Rosenthal blew the save.  Matheny was going to either let Rosenthal lose the game or get out of the inning himself.  I don't know how many times Matheny has to let these kinds of games slip away before he learns how to properly handle his bullpen.
Cardinals,3d369m,civilaiden,2,Mon Jul 13 04:11:37 2015 UTC,Who did we even have left at that point? Socolovich and Greenwood? We weren't getting out of that inning once the save was blown.
Cardinals,3d369m,johnahoe,8,Mon Jul 13 09:38:52 2015 UTC,"They play 162. I would've loved a win, and this was a brutal loss, but oh well. Lose by one or one hundred, it's all the same. Hopefully we can get a push going after the ASB."

Cardinals,3d369m,kuhanluke,3,Mon Jul 13 04:03:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, extra innings games are a crapshoot and 2012 was his rookie season."
Cardinals,3d369m,evanb_,2,Mon Jul 13 04:19:03 2015 UTC,"Our bullpen wasn't very good in 2012 either, which is really the only factor in deciding extra inning games. It's 90% luck, 10% bullpen."
Cardinals,3d369m,huanthewolfhound,6,Mon Jul 13 04:21:27 2015 UTC,"Well, that's crappy for momentum, but we're still not at full strength. We have a break to recuperate and come back out swinging. Plus, we face the Mets first. We can take them easy. Then we have series against Atlanta, the Reds, and the Rockies, all at home. We're very well set up for the rest of the month, IMO."

Cardinals,3d369m,sphericalpuma,2,Mon Jul 13 03:56:37 2015 UTC,"I would have left Tui in.  Rosie has been overworked and hasn't looked sharp. I realize injuries have hit this team but we need to do something about the bullpen, trade for a legit 1b, and hope when Holliday comes back he absolutely rakes.   I don't agree with the bullpen management as of late but then again our offense hasn't been there this entire road trip.  A break is good and hopefully the trade deadline is fruitful."
Cardinals,3d369m,tipnitty,2,Mon Jul 13 03:59:57 2015 UTC,I finally had the weekend off and got to watch my first 3 games of the season on TV.  I'm sorry.   I won't watch any more games.

Cardinals,3d369m,TheWanderingSuperman,2,Mon Jul 13 04:05:09 2015 UTC,"So... I apologize... This loss is on me. I was at the movies for the whole game but got out and turned the radio on... And they got their 4th run.  OK, no problem, clearly the jinx rules say I just turn it off and my bad luck goes away. So I did.  But I had faith in the cardinals, so I waited a few minutes, hoping to hear John Rooney's silver voice proclaiming a win. Fearfully, I turned the dial back up... And they hit the tying run in.  Now knowing the error of my ways I shut off the radio (and maybe punched my seat) and prayed that we could make it to the eleventh.  I should have been stronger, fellow fans, I only wish my will had been resolute. But, I am ashamed to say, I waited a few minutes more before giving into curiosity - and timidly turned the radio back on.  Just in time to hear those GOD-DAMN PIRATES WIN! SHIT!   So, yea, sorry about that. No more baseball for me until we win so I know the curse is lifted."
Cardinals,3d369m,F117Nighthawk,3,Mon Jul 13 04:15:29 2015 UTC,"Instead of being mad at the lack of capitalizing on guys on base, pitching not being up to par, Matheny being too much Mathey for my liking today...I'm gonna blame you. Thanks FOR NOTHING JERK! How could you?! Do you not even care about us?  Sorry. I love you."
Cardinals,3d369m,evilrobotluke,3,Mon Jul 13 04:23:37 2015 UTC,It was really your lady parts that caused the loss

Cardinals,3d369m,mehx1000,2,Mon Jul 13 04:41:01 2015 UTC,So it has occurred to me that in 2006 and 2011 the closers that started the season with the team were not the closers at the end of the year.
Cardinals,3d369m,pittguy578,2,Mon Jul 13 04:47:44 2015 UTC,"Pirates fan here. I think everyone needs to relax. Yes losses were painful, but don't throw team under bus and say get rid of people. Every once in a while a great/All Star caliber player has a bad game. Cutch had a horrible game last night-striking out 3 times. Had never seen that before and want to keep him on the team. Rosenthal had a bad game, but that is the exception. Crazy things happen. If they didn't, Vegas wouldn't be in business. Really think we have no chance catching you unless we get rid of Jeff Locke who is awful. Almost a guaranteed L every time he pitches as of late."
Cardinals,3d369m,cmfletcher,8,Mon Jul 13 13:11:39 2015 UTC,"I know the outcome wasn't what you guys wanted, but you have to appreciate these close games. I sure hope to see a ton more great ball the 2nd half of the season. <3 you."

Even if the plan is horrifying! If, tomorrow, I tell the press that, like, the Cubs will lose, or Ryan Braun is a douchebag, nobody panics, because it's all ""part of the plan"".

Cardinals,3d369m,Mizzydizzy,2,Mon Jul 13 03:54:33 2015 UTC,Guys. It's ok. We came into this series playing our worst baseball while the pirates were playing their best. We still have the division lead. Well be fine for the longhaul
Cardinals,3d369m,Sheathe,2,Mon Jul 13 03:54:45 2015 UTC,"I take comfort in knowing that we are doing better than most teams with our injury problems would.  It will be nice to give the guys a rest, and get some folks back from the DL here soon."
Cardinals,3d369m,Wifflebald,2,Mon Jul 13 03:57:12 2015 UTC,"I honestly do not understand what is going on with our team right now. Even great teams go through slumps, but the way in which we have been losing these games is mind boggling. We finally get a hit with RISP, going 1-21 in the last 2 games in those situations, and our elite closer absolutely coughs up the game.  I'm not even mad. I'm just shocked that we're going down like this. Feels like the '12 NLCS with these fucking losses."

Cardinals,3d369m,nemo_12,2,Mon Jul 13 04:57:35 2015 UTC,"Unless you're talking about all the injuries, that's an absolutely crazy thing to say.

Cardinals,3d3eym,civilaiden,3,Mon Jul 13 10:56:26 2015 UTC,And maybe Piscotty at 1B!!!  How awesome would it be to have a real bullpen AND a real 5 man rotation!
Cardinals,3d3eym,MrRichyPants,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:58:53 2015 UTC,Piscotty  is certainly something to look forward to. He has a higher ceiling than Dan Johnson so it'll be interesting to see how he plays when he gets the chance.  There are a lot of pieces coming into play after the break. Still things to be concerned about but a lot of good things to look forward to.
Cardinals,3d3eym,civilaiden,6,Mon Jul 13 17:43:45 2015 UTC,"That stretch of 8 games in 7 days against our two biggest division rivals was brutal, and 13 games in 12 days overall.  Honestly I'm amazed we managed to compete with the Pirates those last two games.  Say what you will about sloppy play, but they certainly weren't throwing in the towel in extras."
Cardinals,3d3eym,iamadacheat,3,Mon Jul 13 14:41:05 2015 UTC,"They were both so tantalizingly close!  If we could have grabbed them both, the feel would be SO much different over the break!  GAH!"
Cardinals,3d3eym,MrRichyPants,2,Mon Jul 13 16:57:59 2015 UTC,Even one more win against both teams and I think /r/cardinals would be happily drinking nightly.

Cardinals,3d3eym,apiratewithadd,2,Mon Jul 13 07:03:19 2015 UTC,I'm here
Cardinals,3d3eym,beastbass,2,Mon Jul 13 07:02:08 2015 UTC,This break could not possibly have come at a better time. We need a chance to heal and the Pi-rats can get a chance to lose momentum. After the break we have a nice schedule for a while.  Everybody's just gotta chill out. There's a middle ground here where we can acknowledge we played like shit this weekend but not go all chicken little on the season.
Cardinals,3d3eym,lakerdave,3,Mon Jul 13 15:12:43 2015 UTC,Can I be on the extreme where I pretend this weekend never happened and still ride the hype train to a World Series title?
Cardinals,3d4kk9,darthsolumbrae,27,Mon Jul 13 13:54:03 2015 UTC,It was an exciting series but you buc fans and all of /r/baseball are blowing this up. Pirates are still a few games back and people treat this series like it was a World Series.   I hope the rest of the season is this exciting but if every Cardinal loss turns reddit into this shit that will suck. /R/baseball is now dead to me because of how immature everyone there is.
Cardinals,3d4kk9,COYS4,17,Mon Jul 13 14:32:57 2015 UTC,"Yea, /r/baseball turned it into a storm, but lose walkoffs in extra innings to the Buccos back-to-back nights with a nation who hates you...?...it's the perfect recipe.  Plus. We're playing 1/4 our Triple-A roster right now and are still the best team in baseball. I'll take it."
Cardinals,3d4kk9,thedavidlemon,12,Mon Jul 13 14:37:43 2015 UTC,I mean we walked off the Bucs three nights in a row and it wasn't even really talked about.
Cardinals,3d4kk9,bFallen,3,Mon Jul 13 17:16:16 2015 UTC,I like it over there. There's good people and really informative posts. It can get shitty. Always been like that since I've went there. Any sport sub is similar. Different teams face different scorn.  Thing is that you have to embrace it. Think about what it takes to make that many people happy about a walkoff. Those threads weren't just Pirates flairs.
Cardinals,3d4kk9,StLSwifties,5,Mon Jul 13 15:09:54 2015 UTC,Those were some huge games whether the Pirates are still behind or not.  Major momentum building games going into the break.
Cardinals,3d4kk9,Rorbotron,10,Mon Jul 13 16:28:09 2015 UTC,Are people really salty?  We built a lead large enough lead to cover our injuries so far. (In a division with another world championship quality team and another young formidable playoff contender!) We're getting a little vacation that will help those injuries a bit. Some guys are just tired. This helps them immensely. We're well-represented at the All-Star break. We've been a damn good second half team in the recent past. The trade deadline should bring at least something. The rotation is still mighty fine and has exceeded every one of my expectations. The defense. [Insert too many players to reference individually here] The sweltering summer in St. Louis that is a huge home advantage. Baseball.  So why would anyone be salty about a damn good Buccos squad doing exactly what we'd expect to do at home?
Cardinals,3d4kk9,StLSwifties,4,Mon Jul 13 15:02:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I obviously would have preferred a few wins in this last series, but it's not like we were ever out of it. We are in a pretty decent position and a great meta position in baseball. It's hard to be truly upset.  (And for those that disagree, go hang out in the Marlins White Sox sub. Those are frustrating teams to follow right now.)"
Cardinals,3d4kk9,mfranko88,2,Mon Jul 13 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure this was just another series in what is a long season. I get the hype, but i don't buy into it. No need for concern and no reason for Pirates to act as though they've taken conference lead from us. I've been saying for a while that i suspect we will fall from 1st place before September but ultimately end up still winning the conference title"
Cardinals,3d4kk9,kwking13,2,Mon Jul 13 21:10:52 2015 UTC,"I wasn't salty, but I was sadder than I have been for other series losses, I think because every game was so close it was just more of a roller coaster.  Now that it's behind us though, not at all, just ready to rest, get back home and win some games."
Cardinals,3d4kk9,dumonsl,5,Mon Jul 13 21:51:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Steelers had 20 consecutive losing seasons.  Plenty of Cardinals fans are also Rams and Blues fans, and they haven't exactly been known for their success in recent years."
Cardinals,3d4kk9,mike_rotch22,4,Mon Jul 13 16:45:37 2015 UTC,"Are we really rivals? I guess depends on how you define it. I've only ever thought of the cubs as our true rival with the Royals as a secondary because they're american league. Unless rival is just whoever the next best team is vying for position in the conference. Even when the reds were atop the division and the cardinals were sitting at 3rd behind the astros and cubs were in 5th, i still considered the cubs our true rival. I just define the rival as the team that no matter what, year after year, they are the team i hope to beat most and we are the team they hope to beat most. Pirates are the team we're in a conference race for, but the Cubs are the only true rivals in my mind."
Cardinals,3d4kk9,kwking13,3,Mon Jul 13 19:07:09 2015 UTC,"Everyone thinks they are our rival. It happens every couple years with the Reds, Brewers, and now Pirates.  IMO we have two ""arch-rivals"". Meaning we will always have a rivalry with these teams, regardless of our records or recent history: 1. Cubs 2. Royals  I would argue that we have a recent rivalry with these teams due to our recent post-season run-ins: 1. Red Sox 2. Dodgers   The Pirates really don't register. They were a doormat for 20+ years and have put together a couple of seasons."
Cardinals,3d4kk9,BoAwayAccount,3,Mon Jul 13 21:07:09 2015 UTC,I would have to say the Dodgers are a real rivalry considering the amount of (unprompted) Cardinals hate I heard from several Dodgers fans both in person at Wrigley when we played them and on reddit.  I think we've all kind of bonded with the Dodgers fans over it ;)
Cardinals,3d4kk9,totheloop,2,Tue Jul 14 18:05:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man. I gotta say, I could feel the excitement in that stadium through my TV screen Sunday (in addition to the horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach). Must have been incredible to be there in person."

Cardinals,3czz7y,Undeniably_Awesome,17,Sun Jul 12 20:23:54 2015 UTC,"If I may be honest, at least it was the Pirates. They have something about them I just enjoy. Or right, they aren't the Reds, Cubs or Brewers."
Cardinals,3czz7y,IYolkTheGarden,7,Sun Jul 12 15:59:53 2015 UTC,"If the Cardinals are to ever not win the division, I want it to be because of the Pirates. They're a good team, and have guys I could root for. Fuck the rest of the division, though."

Cardinals,3czz7y,DontGiveUpTheDip,5,Sun Jul 12 15:29:46 2015 UTC,That's what we said yesterday.
Cardinals,3czz7y,toastdispatch,10,Sun Jul 12 19:43:52 2015 UTC,I'm about to go take out my frustrations on some golf balls...which will undoubtedly make me even more frustrated
Cardinals,3czz7y,ashlicrowe,8,Sun Jul 12 11:15:36 2015 UTC,Yeah Golfing while frustrated never works out well.

Cardinals,3czz7y,kuhanluke,13,Sun Jul 12 10:00:21 2015 UTC,Get ready to say that a lot over the next 18 years

Cardinals,3czz7y,BetterThanAFoon,2,Sun Jul 12 19:44:11 2015 UTC,I have an eight year old
Cardinals,3czz7y,ashlicrowe,2,Sun Jul 12 19:48:26 2015 UTC,And also...
Cardinals,3czz7y,BetterThanAFoon,2,Sun Jul 12 19:52:32 2015 UTC,5 and 3? I think I'm missing your point
Cardinals,3czz7y,Fluteloop1,2,Sun Jul 12 20:01:58 2015 UTC,I'm saying you yourself have 15 more years of this.
Cardinals,3czz7y,Fluteloop1,2,Sun Jul 12 20:14:47 2015 UTC,Oh I know
Cardinals,3czz7y,bustysteclair,4,Sun Jul 12 20:20:35 2015 UTC,Routine routine routine. It's the only defense for the first year. The first year is all about survival. It's like boot camp.
Cardinals,3czz7y,Fluteloop1,5,Sun Jul 12 16:11:01 2015 UTC,It's hard to have a routine with a two week old.
Cardinals,3czz7y,ElectrifiedPop,6,Sun Jul 12 16:29:23 2015 UTC,Oh in that case it's pure survival mode. The weirdest thing about parenthood is that as you progress along the parental path the first years never seem as hard as they actually are.  Heh its how we ended up with three. We forgot how trying it was those first months. I tip my hat to you and wish you the best.
Cardinals,3czz7y,hail_satan666,9,Sun Jul 12 16:45:50 2015 UTC,Blerg. I'm hungover. And bummed. Meh.

Cardinals,3czz7y,da_asparagus,9,Sun Jul 12 21:17:35 2015 UTC,"Bourbon Street was fun. Took way too many $3 shots. Met some Cards fans down there, talked about hating Cutch. The usual.   Fuck this hangover though."
Cardinals,3czz7y,12in15,5,Sun Jul 12 15:10:10 2015 UTC,Did you do the weird shooters where the shots girl makes out with you?
Cardinals,3czz7y,GoSomaliPirates,3,Sun Jul 12 15:21:19 2015 UTC,Basically. They kept their boundaries but yeah. Also did tit shots
Cardinals,3czz7y,GoSomaliPirates,3,Sun Jul 12 15:38:48 2015 UTC,"Some of those girls are way too aggressive. I had to physically remove one from my person once. She was grabbing my head and trying to force me to take this shot out of her boobs. I mean if you want me in between your boobs, whatevs, but I'm not paying $3 for 0.5 oz of that sugar water you're literally forcing down my throat."
Cardinals,3czz7y,Riodancer,2,Sun Jul 12 18:39:28 2015 UTC,Did you catch diabetes from the hurricanes at Pat O'Brians?  Sing at the Cats Meow?

They'll give you a little bowl of it, than you can spend years trying to find any place that sells it."

He also said that around the 8th inning Shannon starts doing shots.  Oh and there is no tape delay on the broadcast, so whatever he says is going on the air."
Cardinals,3czz7y,SouthpawRage,6,Sun Jul 12 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"Ok people have said this for years, but I just don't see how after all the years he's been supposedly drunk on the air, we've never heard some major slip up, like cursing or saying something racist or inappropriate comments."
Cardinals,3czz7y,huanthewolfhound,7,Sun Jul 12 18:04:28 2015 UTC,"saying something racist   Shannon still calls Wong an Oriental at this point, so...  That is, not to say that Shannon is a racist, just incredibly un-PC."

They mention ""St. Louis has the best record in baseball, but there are still a lot of games left to play.""  They spend a good 20 seconds on just the Cubs and don't even mention the Pirates.  What a fucking joke."

Cardinals,3czz7y,hail_satan666,5,Sun Jul 12 17:19:18 2015 UTC,"Having been at the game yesterday, I gotta say it was a lot of fun. A fellow Cardinals fan ahead of us was very talkative (maybe had a little too much to drink) and got the crowd around us to be friendly and cool (except the Cubs fan, he wanted absolutely nothing to do with us). We all celebrated each other's runs and big plays. It made the ending a lot less painful even if it was disappointing. That said, let's kick their asses tonight."
Cardinals,3czz7y,apiratewithadd,4,Sun Jul 12 17:43:18 2015 UTC,"Guys, I dunno what happened last night.

Cardinals,3czf76,civilaiden,9,Sun Jul 12 04:26:48 2015 UTC,Siegrist/Maness gave up two runs to blow the lead. Rosenthal gave up a run to blow the save. Greenwood had to face McCutchen and lost. No point in crapping on Greenwood when our three most reliable relievers crapped the bed as well.
Cardinals,3czf76,Not_MyCabbages,6,Sun Jul 12 04:42:54 2015 UTC,Because he gave up a home run to one of the best players in baseball on a likely very exhausting day for him? Could've happened to any one of our guys. It's Matheny's fault for not calling for the IBB.
Cardinals,3czf76,evanb_,16,Sun Jul 12 04:45:06 2015 UTC,why in the world would you call for an IBB
Cardinals,3czf76,Joshduman,8,Sun Jul 12 08:07:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would not have understood one there. You intentionally walk him, Worley should easily be able to lay down a bunt. Now we have second and third with one out."
Cardinals,3czf76,evanb_,2,Sun Jul 12 04:26:55 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'd absolutely be complaining if Matheny tried to do that"

Cardinals,3czf76,flagamuffin,13,Sun Jul 12 23:48:47 2015 UTC,"so here's the thing  the more pitchers you use for just a few outs, the more likely you pick one who is way off that night. if you get lucky enough to find a guy like tuiwhatever, who got through two easy innings with a low pitch count, you don't bring in a new pitcher just because you can. you ride that guy until he shows signs he's not good anymore.   if you use your whole bullpen, you are more likely to bring in the guy with no stuff that night (or ever, in greenwood's case)"
Cardinals,3czf76,crackalac,6,Sun Jul 12 04:44:58 2015 UTC,His spot came up in the order  Edit: with the go ahead run on third.

Cardinals,3czf76,houseofpayne55,13,Sun Jul 12 04:23:16 2015 UTC,I know that random things happen in baseball and sometimes they cant be controlled. But throwing a guy who was tired and supposed to start in Memphis against the second best team in baseball in a tight division race was just a poor decision. Hitting Cruz instead of Tuivailala gives us at best a 5% better chance of moving Carpenter along the basepaths. While keeping Tuivailala in who was cruising gives us a far better shot of winning this game. Awful coaching move that will get ignored by this sub because people here assume that because the team is winning Matheny deserves little to no criticism.
Cardinals,3czf76,True-Tiger,11,Sun Jul 12 04:50:57 2015 UTC,I still believe if we keep heyward in this game doesn't go to extras
Cardinals,3czf76,houseofpayne55,3,Sun Jul 12 04:24:11 2015 UTC,"Had to work during the early part of the game, when and why did Matheny take out Heyward?"
Cardinals,3czf76,True-Tiger,2,Sun Jul 12 04:31:10 2015 UTC,cause he was the last to bat wen we were doing a double switch
Cardinals,3czf76,houseofpayne55,3,Sun Jul 12 04:34:56 2015 UTC,I am assuming this was during the later innings? Why was he taking out a top 5 defensive right fielder in a tight game? Was it just because he assumed Heyward wouldnt hit again?
Cardinals,3czf76,kuhanluke,3,Sun Jul 12 04:35:53 2015 UTC,"Yes. Seventh inning, wanted Siegrist to pitch the eighth, brought in Bourjos, who is a top 5 defensive center fielder. It wasn't really a bad move. Just didn't work out."
Cardinals,3czf76,True-Tiger,2,Sun Jul 12 04:37:56 2015 UTC,then bring Borjous to replace Pham you dont take out the best defensive right fielder when you are up 2
Cardinals,3czf76,kuhanluke,3,Sun Jul 12 04:40:02 2015 UTC,"Then you have to PH for Siegrist and he can't pitch the eighth, which was the point."
Cardinals,3czf76,True-Tiger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:43:55 2015 UTC,He wasn't good in the 8th anyway
Cardinals,3czf76,True-Tiger,2,Sun Jul 12 04:46:58 2015 UTC,it was in like the 7th inning we were up 3-1
Cardinals,3czf76,houseofpayne55,2,Sun Jul 12 04:52:23 2015 UTC,"Soo he took out Heyward when we were up, ya that move is poor at best. Never should take out good defenders when leading."
Cardinals,3czf76,Undeniably_Awesome,2,Sun Jul 12 17:16:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, both of the extra inning runs happened after moving Grichuk to RF and taking Heyward out. Grichuk's error on the throw, which Heyward likely would have never done, and Grichuk/Bourjos allowing the triple, which Heyward would have greatly decreased the odds of happening."
Cardinals,3czf76,ExtraBaconPlz,5,Sun Jul 12 04:42:44 2015 UTC,"This particular loss is absolutely on Matheny. He's been horrible all week and today was just the peak of that.   First there's removing your best defensive outfielder in a double switch and having the pitchers spot bat cleanup.  Then there's having Siegrist face the heart of the Pirates order even with unfavorable matchups simply because of ""bullpen roles""  Pitching Greenwood over Villa was the icing on the cake. Greenwood had no business being in that situation.  Matheny GIFTWRAPPED this loss. He's making the same asinine decisions that cost us in the NLCS last year. This whole week has been one boneheaded decision after another."
Cardinals,3czf76,flagamuffin,5,Sun Jul 12 04:44:13 2015 UTC,"it's revisionist history to suddenly pretend siegrist is a lefty specialist. he pitches both sides just fine  however, his whip has been way up lately and i'm not convinced he should be pitching the 8th right now"
Cardinals,3czf76,ABonzaiBanshee,5,Sun Jul 12 04:36:52 2015 UTC,"The two main decisions I'm not a fan of were leaving Siegrist in after he gave up his first run, and using Greenwood instead of Villanueva.  I'm mostly fine with Cruz PHing for Tui because it did end up getting us a run (a run that ended up kind of not mattering, but that's not the point). But yea I was shocked we saw Greenwood instead of Villanueva, and I think the game might have ended differently had Villanueva done the 14th."
Cardinals,3czf76,Davidfreeze,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:44:04 2015 UTC,"That attitude is just a backlash to the rampant ""fire Matheny and impale Mabry on a stake"" jerk that was so prevalent last year"

Cardinals,3czf76,lostinleft,5,Sun Jul 12 04:23:41 2015 UTC,Not at all. Errors KILLED us. Not Matheny.   edit: explain?
Cardinals,3czf76,True-Tiger,9,Sun Jul 12 04:44:03 2015 UTC,Errors AND Matheny killed us  Edit: Heyward doesnt take nearly as bad of angles as Grichuck and i doubt he misess the throw home
Cardinals,3czf76,lostinleft,4,Sun Jul 12 04:25:19 2015 UTC,I believe errors more than Matheny. But I will agree. I just don't think Heyward being in (no error on the throw to 1st) would have changed anything. That's all.
Cardinals,3czf76,True-Tiger,3,Sun Jul 12 04:29:53 2015 UTC,the errors fucked us but matheny never put us in a position to win. keeping Siegrist in when it was clear he wasnt doing well and taking Heyward out were idiotic and then pinch hitting for a pitcher that was on fire to only try to bunt with the pinch hitter
Cardinals,3czf76,Undeniably_Awesome,5,Sun Jul 12 04:35:58 2015 UTC,"And you do realize that first error was from Grichuk's throw from RF, and he also misplayed the ball badly, which caused Bourjos to have to make the throw, which led to Kang legging out a triple. Heyward still being in RF would have likely kept both of those instances from happening. There is absolutely no reason to double switch Heyward out, unless it was due to health reasons, which there is no reason to believe that."
Cardinals,3czf76,iamadacheat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:41:33 2015 UTC,"Double switching Heyward out was still the right call.  We were up 3-1 and Heyward's spot had just come up in the order.  It allowed us to get a full inning out of Siegrist.  In a perfect world, Reynolds catches Siegrist's pickoff throw, Siegrist gets through that inning, and we win 3-1.  Shit happens."
Cardinals,3czf76,ScruffyDaJanitor,3,Sun Jul 12 04:45:09 2015 UTC,"Just out of nowhere. Welp, Cards really didn't play well tonight, way too many mistakes."

Cardinals,3czf76,houseofpayne55,4,Sun Jul 12 14:59:37 2015 UTC,"Zero need to take out Tuivailala, he was cruising and had only thrown like 20 pitches."
Cardinals,3czf76,Drew119,4,Sun Jul 12 04:26:36 2015 UTC,"Hah. Like Tuivailala would be capable of getting Carpenter from 1st to 3rd on a missed bunt. HAH, I say."
Cardinals,3czf76,crackalac,3,Sun Jul 12 04:26:52 2015 UTC,Except for the fact that you had to pinch hit for his spot.
Cardinals,3czf76,houseofpayne55,3,Sun Jul 12 04:23:39 2015 UTC,"Did you really? Tony Cruz doesnt really have a much better chance of moving Carpenter along the basepaths than Tuivailala, who was drafted as a position player."

Cardinals,3czf76,2011StlCards,4,Sun Jul 12 04:28:38 2015 UTC,This is the first big game this year that I have really questioned Matheny a lot. Why take out Heyward? Why take out Tuivalala out? I just don't get it
Cardinals,3czf76,crackalac,5,Sun Jul 12 04:32:55 2015 UTC,Both moves made sense. Sometimes it just doesn't work.
Cardinals,3czf76,2011StlCards,4,Sun Jul 12 04:22:52 2015 UTC,Did the Heyward move make sense?
Cardinals,3czf76,kuhanluke,3,Sun Jul 12 04:27:13 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. His spot wasn't coming up in the order, and Grichuk is a good outfielder who just struggled a bit. We also improved in center with Bourjos > Pham and pretty even in LF with Pham ≈ Grichuk.   If we reached Heyward's spot in the order, it would mean the game was in extras or we scored runs. Well, that first thing happened. But you don't play a game for extras. You play to win in 9 and figure it out from there if you have to."
Cardinals,3czf76,2011StlCards,2,Sun Jul 12 04:31:39 2015 UTC,"See but that is exactly why I would not have taken out Heyward. He has the best arm on the team and defense in the late innings is critical (as we saw).  Now Grichuk is a pretty good outfielder, but not as good as Heyward. I don't think it would ever be a good idea to remove your best defensive outfielder"
Cardinals,3czf76,kuhanluke,2,Sun Jul 12 04:34:20 2015 UTC,Our best defensive outfielder is Peter Bourjos and we put him into the game.
Cardinals,3czf76,2011StlCards,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:49:05 2015 UTC,I know it is not necessarily definitive but according to baseball reference Peter has been worth -.4 dWAR while Heyward is worth 0.7 dWAR.
Cardinals,3czf76,kuhanluke,2,Sun Jul 12 04:54:44 2015 UTC,so Bourjos is a better defender if you take away positional adjustment.   And dWAR is a heavily flawed stat.   And you need at least a 3-year sample for most defensive stats.
Cardinals,3czf76,2011StlCards,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:57:48 2015 UTC,"The flaw in this comparison of course is comparing players that do not play the same position. One is in right and one in center. Bourjos is definitely the best CF we have, and Heyward is by far the best RF. ESPECIALLY considering his arm. He could have made a huge difference on the base hit that made the score 3-2  NO matter what, I think it is undeniable that putting Grichuk in RF instead of Heyward is a negative defensively"
Cardinals,3czf76,crackalac,2,Sun Jul 12 05:07:54 2015 UTC,Yeah
Cardinals,3czf76,Undeniably_Awesome,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"How does the Heyward move make sense? He's a better outfielder than both Grichuk and Pham. He was also hitting cleanup, which is NOT where the pitcher's spot should be."
Cardinals,3czf76,crackalac,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:20:06 2015 UTC,It was either him or Yadi.
Cardinals,3czf76,kuhanluke,3,Sun Jul 12 04:47:18 2015 UTC,Tuiavalala's spot came up in the batting order.
Cardinals,3czf76,2011StlCards,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:41:09 2015 UTC,"That one I agree with now that you mention that. There was no way to see the wild throw sending Carp to 3rd. I just think that it would have been better to have Sam possibly bunt.  Oh well, can't win them all"
Cardinals,3czf76,lostinleft,2,Sun Jul 12 04:45:14 2015 UTC,Without the error the game is probably completely different.

Cardinals,3czf76,sphericalpuma,3,Sun Jul 12 04:50:32 2015 UTC,Do you have the serial numbers?  File a police report and include the numbers. This makes sure pawn shops are aware of theft.   That's absolutely horrible.  People fucking suck sometimes.
Cardinals,3czf76,heajv,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:36:24 2015 UTC,Yeah we do. Luckily
Cardinals,3czf76,kes4114,4,Sun Jul 12 04:39:29 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with any of the Pirates players. Kang played his ass off and McCutchen is just awesome all around. What I have a problem with is fans booing constantly and then cheering when players almost get hit in the face. And I think we can all agree that the umps weren't fantastic tonight, but the level of hate coming from the fans at the ballpark was just kind of ridiculous."
Cardinals,3czf76,kuhanluke,7,Sun Jul 12 04:37:20 2015 UTC,"Ugh, Kang has the makings of a Cardinal killer."
Cardinals,3czf76,Joshduman,11,Sun Jul 12 04:38:45 2015 UTC,"Pittsburgh was already pissed off at what Lynn said last night. AJ's last start, what should have given him 8 great innings, a foul tip was called wrong and he ended up walking a guy and being taken out.  The game was sold out, and the same thing happens allowing a run to score (that ultimately made the game force extras). And then, another arguable call is made. I can totally understand why the fans were riled.  That being said, I didn't hear cheers for players almost hit in the face. That is a little too far."
Cardinals,3czf76,civilaiden,2,Sun Jul 12 04:36:02 2015 UTC,It happened fairly early in the game. Yadi had to duck away from a ball coming up and in and the fans went nuts. Wish I could find the clip and compare it to the AJ homerun because it probably would have fairly close at how loud it got. Really knocked my respect for the Pirates fanbase. I'm trying to remember that its probably just a vocal minority but cheering on that kind of shit is a pet peeve.
Cardinals,3czf76,mehx1000,2,Sun Jul 12 04:44:53 2015 UTC,It's their turf.  They can do what they want.    Tomorrow is a huge game.  A brutal road trip can end at 4-4 if we just find a way to win tomorrow.  That's all I wanted to begin with.
Cardinals,3czf76,lostinleft,2,Sun Jul 12 04:51:23 2015 UTC,Errors. TOOTBLAN. Greenwood.   None are Major League.
Cardinals,3czf76,crackalac,5,Sun Jul 12 20:13:16 2015 UTC,Greenwood has been good pretty much every time he's been up.
Cardinals,3czf76,lostinleft,2,Sun Jul 12 04:42:57 2015 UTC,The pretty much part sucks.
Cardinals,3czf76,Undeniably_Awesome,2,Sun Jul 12 04:28:18 2015 UTC,"But he hasn't been very good this season in the minors. And to make matter worse, he had a good outing last night (I believe) so he was probably completely spent and really had no business pitching this soon."
Cardinals,3czf76,crackalac,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:30:10 2015 UTC,I was admittedly unaware of both of those.
Cardinals,3czf76,fre1102,2,Sun Jul 12 04:31:55 2015 UTC,"Greenwood lost us a game one of the last times I saw him too.  Not particularly upset at him (he's a AAA pitcher, what do you expect?), but either earlier this year or last year he did this exact thing."
Cardinals,3czf76,crackalac,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:43:37 2015 UTC,I think it was this year. I thought he should have been on the postseason roster last year.
Cardinals,3czf76,SineMetu_spqr,2,Sun Jul 12 04:44:58 2015 UTC,One of the most exciting loses of the season.
Cardinals,3czf76,Michael_Wacha,2,Sun Jul 12 14:28:49 2015 UTC,Now I know how Texas Ranger fans felt in 2011.
Cardinals,3czf76,nyxon22,4,Sun Jul 12 16:13:22 2015 UTC,that probably felt worse.
Cardinals,3czf76,yung_iron,2,Sun Jul 12 04:28:56 2015 UTC,I was originally so pissed that our bullpen blew in 3 times tonight. But then I realized we have been lucky that our pitching has been so good that this is probably our toughest loss this year. Good job Pirates
Cardinals,3czf76,DundahMifflin,2,Sun Jul 12 04:33:09 2015 UTC,I cannot understand why we wouldn't intentionally walk him.
Cardinals,3czf76,MostFruitfulMufasa,6,Sun Jul 12 04:48:30 2015 UTC,"That's a bold move cotton, i know he's a beast but int walk to put a runner in scoring pos with no outs in the bottom of the 14th?"
Cardinals,3czf76,GrubFisher,6,Sun Jul 12 04:53:30 2015 UTC,"But Cutch's MMORPG perk is literally ""walkoff specialist"""
Cardinals,3czf76,DundahMifflin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:24:33 2015 UTC,"It would be a risky shot of course, and I didn't see who was next at bat, but I suppose I'm just angry over everything else."
Cardinals,3czf76,MostFruitfulMufasa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:25:54 2015 UTC,Agreed that game was something else
Cardinals,3czf76,t-poke,6,Sun Jul 12 04:26:53 2015 UTC,"Meh. With a runner on and no out, it wasn't the right move. Hindsight's 20/20."
Cardinals,3czf76,crackalac,3,Sun Jul 12 04:28:54 2015 UTC,That would have been a bad move. You are basically giving them two runners in scoring position.
Cardinals,3czf76,cmfletcher,2,Sun Jul 12 16:37:40 2015 UTC,I'm glad I didn't have to kill myself tonight.<3 It was great hanging with you Cardbros. What a weird baseball game.
Cardinals,3czf76,Pashto96,3,Sun Jul 12 04:28:10 2015 UTC,That was a rough one to lose but I had a great time at PNC! The fans around me were awesome but I didn't like the crowd as a whole. They pretty much booed at every chance they got

Cardinals,3czf76,LLv2,0,Sun Jul 12 05:19:45 2015 UTC,I vote for Nick Greenwood to pitch in the All-Star Game.  At Class A.
Cardinals,3czf76,mehx1000,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:23:39 2015 UTC,It's really a shame that it ever got to that point.  AAA pitcher vs NL MVP.  What could go wrong?
Cardinals,3czf76,LLv2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:24:31 2015 UTC,He didn't look like a AAA pitcher to me.  He looked like an A pitcher.
Cardinals,3czf76,MattAdams53,3,Sun Jul 12 04:44:12 2015 UTC,"He isn't the best pitcher we have, but not everyone can be a Seth Maness and have a 3.00ERA straight out of AAA. To be honest, he's the typical 24th man who gets jerked around as the team needs. That must the tough"
Cardinals,3czf76,Evownz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:28:30 2015 UTC,"Remember when it was 3-0? Yeah, that was fun. God dammit, how many times can you just hand a game to another team before it's considered willful. I'm so fucking pissed."
Cardinals,3czf76,fre1102,2,Sun Jul 12 06:33:37 2015 UTC,"To be fair, until this year, I very sincerely would have believed it if it showed up in the Post Dispatch one day either:  1) Matheny was taking money to lose games.   2) Matheny's concussion symptoms lingered and he occasionally wondered around the clubhouse with no pants holding a handful of his own...waste.  Until this year, there's really no reasonable explanation for his ability to throw games other than his actual mental retardation, or corruption.  There haven't been nearly that many of those games this year. And even last night I found myself thinking that an actual excellent MLB manager would have a starter out there to win the game and rest over the break, but that it was okay Matheny was just working through his normal relievers.  To tell the truth I was just very pleased he used Rosenthal at all, rather than hold him back because road game."
Cardinals,3czf76,fasterdriver,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:42:38 2015 UTC,This was oddly reminiscent of the '13 world series when we pitched to big papi. Why the hell do we let their best player beat us? Walk his ass and go after the next guy.
Cardinals,3czf76,crackalac,4,Sun Jul 12 04:33:40 2015 UTC,You really had no choice there. Runner was already in first and there were no outs.
Cardinals,3czf76,mehx1000,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:25:06 2015 UTC,"Well the leadoff hit was the poison dagger.  If we walk Cutch, Worley (or some other pitcher) is probably bunting so they have the winning run on 2nd (and the tying run on 3rd) with one out.     At that point you're almost just playing for the tie in terms of win expectancy, and on to more extra innings.  Anyway, shit happens.  Let's get em tomorrow"
Cardinals,3czf76,DiscoJer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:39:04 2015 UTC,Well that was as crushing a defeat as I can remember. At least in the regular season.
Cardinals,3czf76,nyxon22,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:50:38 2015 UTC,Well Matheny continues to mismanage the bullpen...but I guess there isn't a lot you can do so late in the game. It just didn't feel like we would win even when we were up 5-4. Fun game - we'll win tomorrow and then the bullpen can get some rest.
Cardinals,3czf76,GrubFisher,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:52:49 2015 UTC,"Bullpen? Rest? With a minor league fallback pitcher? Against the Pirates?  Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh. Not gonna be a fun all star break."
Cardinals,3czf76,nyxon22,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:28:48 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, we have six all stars and the best record in baseball. And Matt ""Forearms"" Holliday is coming back right after. I think the break will be just fine."
Cardinals,3czf76,DontGiveUpTheDip,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:29:21 2015 UTC,Isn't Jaime coming back too?
Cardinals,3czf76,Goldstubble,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:30:20 2015 UTC,Where the hell was villanueva in this? He is the exact pitcher we should using here!
Cardinals,3czf76,DontGiveUpTheDip,3,Sun Jul 12 04:33:51 2015 UTC,He pitched a lot yesterday. Lynn only lasted like 4 innings
Cardinals,3czf76,BetterThanAFoon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:50:34 2015 UTC,Just a musing here..... Say we burned through Greenwood.... Would Matheny have considered using Wacha after Villanueva?  That was the thought going through my head... Then Cutch was Clutch and made my thought OBE
Cardinals,3czf76,lostinleft,2,Sun Jul 12 04:30:41 2015 UTC,I am sure of it. We have gone too far not to use starters. They will have rest over the All Star Break.
Cardinals,3czf76,T_R_A_I_L,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:37:38 2015 UTC,So did anyone else start drinking in the extra innings just to relax? Because I sure did. Man lets hope Cppney can do good tommorow.
Cardinals,3czf76,crackalac,2,Sun Jul 12 04:34:06 2015 UTC,Drinking huh? Can't tell... 😏
Cardinals,3czf76,T_R_A_I_L,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:36:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly I was hoping we would have won it in the 10th, but then the pirates tied it and I knew it was probably for the best the grab a beer. ;)"
Cardinals,3cyzhd,kdanson,12,Sun Jul 12 01:41:21 2015 UTC,Wow. Panik should at least be starting.  It's going to be so embarrassing when Bochy costs us the potential for home-field advantage.
Cardinals,3cyzhd,evanb_,2,Sun Jul 12 01:43:33 2015 UTC,Panik is his own guy. I think he was trying to avoid allegations of homerism.
Cardinals,3cyzhd,kuhanluke,2,Sun Jul 12 02:42:07 2015 UTC,He already picked Bum over Kershaw so he threw that out the window a while ago
Cardinals,3cyzhd,bFallen,4,Sun Jul 12 06:26:08 2015 UTC,You mean Bum that was last years postseason hero and who this year is having a better year  Kershaw is better historically but he is not deserving this year.
Cardinals,3cyzhd,rambaroo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:26:25 2015 UTC,Iiterally every pitching metric has Kershaw as better than Bumgarner this year
Cardinals,3cyzhd,fps916,-2,Sun Jul 12 19:26:25 2015 UTC,That be true When i look at it.   Problem is he isn't pitching kershaw numbers and he also flamed out last postseason
Cardinals,3cyzhd,rambaroo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:23:10 2015 UTC,"Look at peripherals and see if you still think Kershaw is having a worse season than Bum.  Kershaw's having an even better year than his historic 2014 campaign if you look at K/9, BB/9, etc"
Cardinals,3cyzhd,bFallen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:27:39 2015 UTC,It is all irrelevant he is on the team now.
Cardinals,3cyzhd,rambaroo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:31:24 2015 UTC,It is not irrelevant given the discussion was about Bochy showing his homerism (which he did by picking Bum over Kersh)
Cardinals,3cyzhd,bFallen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:43:14 2015 UTC,He picked his player as he should. Why the fuck would he leave his ace out for the ace of a rival. You seem to be under the delusion that the AS game is a merit based thing.   The fact that all teams must be represented blows that shit out of the water.
Cardinals,3cyzhd,rambaroo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:55:26 2015 UTC,It should be a merit thing and it's a disgrace that it's not.
Cardinals,3cyzhd,bFallen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:17:15 2015 UTC,If it was a merit thing you would get teams who dominated the game. it was never meant to be a serious thing.
Cardinals,3cyzhd,rambaroo,6,Mon Jul 13 15:20:01 2015 UTC,But DJ was already on the team. How does this effect Wong?
Cardinals,3cyzhd,msoverby10,10,Sun Jul 12 02:28:28 2015 UTC,"Gordon was injured today, so LeMahieu replaced him, therefore leaving a reserve spot open. Tulo ended up getting that reserve spot instead."
Cardinals,3cyzhd,DontGiveUpTheDip,8,Sun Jul 12 03:10:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's obvious after scouring the internet to find the information. However, nothing in the OPs post addresses the fact that Tulo was added to the roster."
Cardinals,3cyzhd,msoverby10,3,Sun Jul 12 03:28:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry for the confusion. Was mainly basing it off position. DJ replaces Gordon as starter at 2nd and Wong doesn't make it on the roster at 2nd base."
Cardinals,3cyzhd,Undeniably_Awesome,2,Sun Jul 12 14:15:25 2015 UTC,"There's still hope that maybe Wong will replace Holliday, because I don't think they've named a replacement for him yet."
Cardinals,3cyzhd,therescue,3,Sun Jul 12 04:12:39 2015 UTC,"Well, DJ is replacing Gordon in the starting lineup, he was already on the team. Tulowitzki is replacing Gordon on the team though. Which I still think should have been Wong."
Cardinals,3cyzhd,kuhanluke,3,Sun Jul 12 02:32:35 2015 UTC,Wong didn't even make the final vote. Tulo did. No way could he take Wong.
Cardinals,3cyzhd,crackalac,3,Sun Jul 12 02:43:32 2015 UTC,Don't have to be in the final vote. It should be based on position.
Cardinals,3cyzhd,kuhanluke,3,Sun Jul 12 03:03:48 2015 UTC,Tulo is a middle infielder and I'm pretty sure on of the other SS has some 2B experience.
Cardinals,3cyzhd,crackalac,3,Sun Jul 12 03:05:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm fine with tulo. I'm just saying in general if you lose a player to injury to want to replace them somehow even if there's not a final vote candidate.
Cardinals,3cyzhd,kuhanluke,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:11:13 2015 UTC,You replace him with the next closest position player to making the game. Tulo was on the final vote because he was close to making the roster anyway.
Cardinals,3cyzhd,crackalac,2,Sun Jul 12 03:13:16 2015 UTC,"Right. We don't disagree here. I'm saying if the final vote candidates are all filled with non infielders, there's no obligation to take from that list."
Cardinals,3cyzhd,kuhanluke,2,Sun Jul 12 03:36:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess, but Dozier replaced Bautista, so idk."

Cardinals,3cxxep,sararosered,3,Sun Jul 12 04:54:05 2015 UTC,Handled. Lemme know if anyone else decides to be a jagoff.  You know how we feel about that.
Cardinals,3cxxep,kuhanluke,4,Sun Jul 12 04:37:48 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I feel like we should have an /r/baseballmods to keep all of the team sub mods in the loop about this kind of stuff.
Cardinals,3cxxep,sararosered,2,Sun Jul 12 04:38:13 2015 UTC,/r/baseballmoderators is a thing... (I believe it's a closed group though) but hasn't been used in over a year.   I am fairly certain that all the NL Central mods know our policy of banning anyone who trolls on another sub (I mean it's posted specifically to NOT do it in each of our threads) and will reach out and let us know if it is getting out of line.  Really only have issues during divisional games it seems... :/
Cardinals,3cxxep,kuhanluke,3,Sun Jul 12 04:53:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know about the Brewers mods, but we're always in contact with the other mods in the division. I mean, you two and /u/Rapture00 hang out here all the time and I know during the Cubs series, we had a few cross-bans. But our division doesn't have any representatives in /r/baseball and /r/cardinals is mostly secluded from /r/baseball, more than other baseball subs tend to be, I feel."
Cardinals,3cxxep,Rapture00,2,Sun Jul 12 04:54:56 2015 UTC,One of the guys is now banned from /r/Reds.   Ty for the heads up.
Cardinals,3cxxep,sararosered,2,Sun Jul 12 04:58:54 2015 UTC,Honestly most of us seem to avoid /r/baseball so it has never been an issue... frankly I could care less what they do there. We most always invite other subs to play and haven't had issues.

Cardinals,3cxxep,houseofpayne55,2,Sun Jul 12 04:46:24 2015 UTC,Hit spot in the lineup came up.
Cardinals,3cxxep,crackalac,2,Sun Jul 12 04:21:06 2015 UTC,"Tony Cruz hit for him, which gives only a slightly better chance than Tuivailala who was drafted as a position player. Bad coaching decision."
Cardinals,3cxxep,houseofpayne55,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:21:05 2015 UTC,Good decision. Didn't work out. I hope he would make it again tomorrow.
Cardinals,3cxxep,crackalac,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:24:36 2015 UTC,Have we watched the same Tony Cruz over the past couple of years? He is purely a defensive backup catcher and his hitting presence really doesnt warrant bringing in a minor league pitcher for a guy who had dominated two straight innings and had a low pitch count. If it was any other pitch hitter besides Kozma or Cruz its a good move to take out Tuivailala..
Cardinals,3cxxep,houseofpayne55,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:26:35 2015 UTC,Giving him the chance vs tui for a third inning? Yeah I'll stick with this decision.

Cardinals,3cxxep,DontGiveUpTheDip,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:17:06 2015 UTC,I think also saving him in case they manage a come back again. He could pitch multiple innings if necessary.  Not ideal since he worked yesterday but possible.

Cardinals,3cxhkr,kuhanluke,6,Sat Jul 11 17:51:05 2015 UTC,"I assume he meant at 1B, where it was reported he'd spend some time. But he only made his first professional start there yesterday and hadn't played 3B since 2012."

Cardinals,3cxhkr,PinkFreudianSlips,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:53:04 2015 UTC,I would expect we roll with Dan Johnson on the roster for a few weeks while Piscotty gets his reps in at 1B in Memphis then send Johnson down (or DFA him if he can't be sent down) and bring Piscotty up. I think it's a blunder on Mo's part to not have Piscotty playing 1B at Memphis as soon as Adams went down.  There was no reason at all to believe Reynolds could even tread water there full time.
Cardinals,3cxhkr,bjsy92,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:05:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's exactly how I feel about it, I mean Reynolds mentioned a couple of times that he was not expecting to be in an every day role, and that frankly, he's worn out.  He knows how old he is, he knows his body. If a player is openly admitting to the media that he's beat, it might be time to start looking at options, or trying to groom from within, with the most appropriate candidate being Piscotty.   Or at least that's how I feel about it."

Cardinals,3cu0lr,DustAndSound,6,Sat Jul 11 01:20:02 2015 UTC,A pirates radio ad just said that Ganghis Kahn was the first pirate. That is just so incredibly false.

Cardinals,3cu0lr,DrUlysses314,2,Sat Jul 11 01:23:28 2015 UTC,"We've gotta try the one in Creve Coeur. The little half course at Arnold park is the one we usually go to just because it's close. My boyfriend played the JB course once, and hated it because he lost like three discs there lol  The only other one I've played is in Branson, and it was mega hard."

Cardinals,3cr45b,ReturnOf_TheHack,7,Fri Jul 10 03:36:38 2015 UTC,Aaron Paul was fantastic all series. The character development really made him have to be able to do all types of acting.
Cardinals,3cr45b,DlSCOSTU,7,Fri Jul 10 02:45:03 2015 UTC,He was not a good actor in the early seasons but he developed tremendously with his character. It is sunk in with me when he has dinner at the White's in the final season.
Cardinals,3cr45b,LLv2,2,Fri Jul 10 02:53:03 2015 UTC,What? He was not good in season one?  In the pilot episode?  Are you fucking crazy? He was so good that Vince Gilligan couldn't kill him even though the story said he was supposed to die!
Cardinals,3cr45b,BackInRed,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:49:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have to agree here, maybe he just didn't like the character he was playing early on (high school dropout/dumbass drug dealer) but at no point was Aaron Paul ever a bad actor during the show."

Cardinals,3cr45b,reallifebadass,7,Fri Jul 10 02:43:40 2015 UTC,short review of safeco?
Cardinals,3cr45b,Totschlag,7,Fri Jul 10 02:56:34 2015 UTC,"Great views everywhere with a Fantastic view of the city and Century link field. The view is near Pittsburgh level.  The roof is just a roof, no enclosement, so you still have that outdoors feel during rain.  You can walk right up to the bullpens, like 5 ft. away from the rubber in the outfield concourse.  You can see the entire field from the concourse at all times.  No real negatives at all. Even the team store is impressive."
Cardinals,3cr45b,LLv2,6,Fri Jul 10 03:07:40 2015 UTC,"What was wrong with Dodger Stadium?  It's a terrific baseball park.  Angel Stadium, though - how could you give better than meh?"

It's not very clean (better than o.co in this respect, but oakland has way better sightlines)  In general - it just shows its age. Not a bad place to catch a game, but not like petco in that I immediately wish I could spend whole days walking through it. Overall it's  just... meh.   O.co is only higher because the view from the upper deck (where I sat) was far better than the view from  Dodger stadiums upper deck."
Cardinals,3cr45b,Totschlag,3,Fri Jul 10 03:56:52 2015 UTC,Angel stadium's concourses were nicer than dodger stadium. Better views. It's not that much better tbh.   I should not that history doesn't play that big of a factor into my park rankings.

Cardinals,3cpvi8,penguinn,6,Thu Jul 9 22:29:46 2015 UTC,"Ghostbusters nerd here, I just wanted to point out that Bill Murray demanding Lorenzo Music's head is overblown to the point of being an internet urban legend.  The producers of the show had deliberately made the characters look and sound different from their film counterparts because they hadn't secured likeness rights from Murray, Ramis, Aykroyd, or Hudson. Maurice LaMarche, the voice of Egon, remarked that the producers specifically not do any sort of Harold Ramis impression, though LaMarche ended up kind of doing one anyway.  Murray is said to have remarked to Ivan Reitman that he liked the show, but asked why Venkman didn't sound like him. Apparently the producers had never thought to just ask for permission to use Murray's likeness, and when they found out they could have it, they decided on their own to recast the role.   Producer Michael C. Gross, LaMarche, and Dave Coulier (who replaced Music as Venkman) have all gone on record saying it was a decision made by the producers, and Bill Murray never demanded it or anything like that. It sounds like it was an innocent question that either prompted an overreaction, or the producers were simply excited to get tacit permission to use Bill's likeness."

Cardinals,3coic1,Undeniably_Awesome,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:02:24 2015 UTC,"I got an email about it from the Cardinals.  I can't find the site that told me it was within 1%, but there are many sites showing the standings.  I found them through this site called Google.  For example:  One, Two."
Cardinals,3coic1,kuhanluke,2,Fri Jul 10 03:41:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure if Cueto wins, Martinez will also go. Cueto pitches Sunday, so he's ineligible to pitch in the ASG. Don't know if that means they go with #2 or not, but make of it what you will."
Cardinals,3coic1,Undeniably_Awesome,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:19:37 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, and I could be wrong, is that even if Cueto wins and is ineligible to pitch, he wouldn't be replaced, since it's not due to injury."
Cardinals,3coic1,kuhanluke,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:03:39 2015 UTC,I was pretty sure ineligible pitchers were also replaced on the roster but I could be mistaken.
Cardinals,3coic1,Undeniably_Awesome,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:19:00 2015 UTC,That might be how it is. I really have no evidence except that I've seen many people say what I said haha. I could be very wrong.

Cardinals,3coic1,havenwood29,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:27:17 2015 UTC,We should do a joint Royals/Cards agreement. They vote for Cmart and we vote for Moose.
Cardinals,3coic1,readermom,3,Thu Jul 9 20:50:16 2015 UTC,They did. The cardinals social media accounts were all pushing for this.   http://i.imgur.com/pKr46yl.png
Cardinals,3coic1,havenwood29,3,Thu Jul 9 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"Ah, didn't know that. Let's hope the Royals got the message."
Cardinals,3coic1,fps916,2,Thu Jul 9 21:59:33 2015 UTC,Or we could vote someone worthy into the game like Dozier
Cardinals,3coic1,tonyallen09,-7,Fri Jul 10 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love CarMart, but Kershaw is so much more deserving."
Cardinals,3coic1,readermom,6,Thu Jul 9 17:59:03 2015 UTC,"Also, I don't want Cueto to win so vote for whoever you want.  CMart is #2 so I think his chances are better, maybe..."
Cardinals,3coic1,intend,3,Thu Jul 9 19:10:58 2015 UTC,Anyone but Cueto.
Cardinals,3coic1,schnaderhops,11,Thu Jul 9 22:06:03 2015 UTC,Not based off of this year.
Cardinals,3coic1,tonyallen09,7,Thu Jul 9 18:13:36 2015 UTC,"Well so far this year, Kershaw only has the lowest SIERA in MLB at 2.23 and while also being first in K's at 160."
Cardinals,3coic1,thatoneguy211,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:20:05 2015 UTC,"Kershaw leads the majors in xFIP by a wide margin, strikeouts by a wide margin, SIERA, and is 4th in the majors in WAR and IP.  The only stat CarMart has going for him is his ERA, which he's 15th in (and Kershaw is right behind at 21)."
Cardinals,3coic1,Undeniably_Awesome,2,Thu Jul 9 21:16:17 2015 UTC,"Then you should vote for who you feel you want to see make the game. I totally understand wanting to vote for Kershaw. I probably would of not for Martinez. However, baseball is a game of entertainment, and Carlos Martinez is extremely entertaining to watch play baseball. He's also pretty good, and is deserving of being an All-Stat, as is Kershaw."
Cardinals,3cps53,MattAdams53,8,Thu Jul 9 20:13:29 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of very good analysis here, thanks. I was quite surprised that Yadi actually got up during a play (more than once, you showed) to argue with the umpire."
Cardinals,3cps53,Shocho,8,Thu Jul 9 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"Computer assisted strikezone.  The tech is there. Now all pitchers, catchers, managers, umpires know what the strikezone is going to be....every game of the year. The ump will still be there and call fouls, outs, etc. Computer makes the call and he can relay the message(a green/red light blinks for the call).  Zone tightens, a hitter and pitchers approach is streamlined, everyone knows what to expect and how the strikezone is going to be. Offense probably goes up. Whats the downside....tradition? Bullshit. We have replay. Plus pitchers throw upper 90s all day, make em throw it for a strike....make em actually pitch.   There was a pitcher, for Boston I think in WS couple years ago that when paired up with a certain umpire his ERA was .035 or some shit. Thats unacceptable. It shouldn't be  ""oh, pitcher has to adjust to the umps strikezone or the hitter needs to adjust to strikes being called outside, or as long as its consistent then its fine""....bullshit. A strike is a strike and a ball is a ball, not dependent on what mood the ump is in. Its 2015, we have the capabilities.  /rant"
Cardinals,3cps53,meowmeowtits,2,Thu Jul 9 20:57:30 2015 UTC,a strike is a strike and a ball is a ball   Yes!  I especially hate that the zone is always bigger on 3-0 counts and smaller on 0-2 counts.
Cardinals,3cps53,iamadacheat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:56:47 2015 UTC,I believe you and agree but could you explain how this would actually be feasible? Like how does the computer track and extremely quickly notify the ump of the call.
Cardinals,3cps53,Alexhasskills,3,Thu Jul 9 22:20:36 2015 UTC,"Series of precise multi angled cameras that work in coordination.  Look at what ESPN can do with StatCast and the 3D strike zone. Now remove the commercial nonsense of that and make it better. Computers recognize ball hit zone, signal ump, he relays call.   Testing in spring training. Tweaks. Implement."
Cardinals,3cps53,meowmeowtits,3,Thu Jul 9 22:32:49 2015 UTC,"Ear buds... The strike zone is pretty well automated now. It could have a program set up to tell him ""BALL"" or ""STRIKE"" in about 1 second or so."
Cardinals,3cps53,Unbelieverable,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:32:40 2015 UTC,You know how you watch games live and there's a pitch tracker that shows you exactly where the pitch went?  You've been watching live pitch tracking for years.  A ridiculously simply program could check whether the result is in the box and notify the umpire.  Or we could get rid of the umpire completely and it just shows up on the big screen / announcements.
Cardinals,3cps53,Alexhasskills,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:01:58 2015 UTC,Has any commissioner said anything about possibly implementing this? Obviously umps are against it because they'd be out of a job.
Cardinals,3cps53,Unbelieverable,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:21:29 2015 UTC,"As far as I know it's not being considered.  People talk about keeping umpires and human error because of tradition.  But in my opinion that's bullshit.  Umpires back in the day used to call games as accurately as possible.  We should stick with that and call games as accurately as possible, which means replays and automation.  The human error was unavoidable back then, it's not like they chose to be wrong.  It's avoidable now."
Cardinals,3cps53,meowmeowtits,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:24:51 2015 UTC,"I think ump stays. Gotta make calls at home. Any glitches or tech difficulty he can make the call on that pitch too, plus be in control of counts including fouls, foul tip Ks, etc."
Cardinals,3cps53,thetasigma1355,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:13:30 2015 UTC,"IIRC the Umps in last years NLCS were all notorious for calling low strikes which was a large advantage for the Giants. It was also a failing on Matheny and the Cardinals staff for not adjusting to this, a fact that I believe was broadcast on air before game 1. Our hitters weren't swinging at low pitches and our pitchers weren't throwing low pitches."
Cardinals,3cps53,meowmeowtits,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:05:53 2015 UTC,"And I think thats pure and utter bullshit. A player shouldn't have to adjust to a strike zone each game. Not in today's world. A team shouldn't all of a sudden gain a huge advantage in a series because they happened on lining up with certain umpires.   Thats too much influence for umps. They should be nothing to the game. They shouldn't add or detract from the players performances.   Thats why I hate watching football and basketball. The refs control those sports. Huge control. Umps have a small influence in baseball but its enough to have impacts over the coursenof 162 games. Lets remove that varience and completely level the field, then watch player talent be the show."
Cardinals,3cps53,reallifebadass,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:29:06 2015 UTC,The umpire's union will never let that happen.
Cardinals,3cps53,Wifflebald,3,Fri Jul 10 17:52:59 2015 UTC,"The author tries so hard to stay in the middle ground, but by the evidence they present and the calls made, it is obvious that we got hosed on a few pretty huge calls that series. Obviously, the umps made other good and bad calls. It just so happens that we were on the wrong end of several game-changing calls."
Cardinals,3cps53,JohnnyMotif,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:47:06 2015 UTC,actually that strike zone looks pretty good to me
Cardinals,3cps53,Wifflebald,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:14:38 2015 UTC,"No I agree. I just meant the sequences he highlighted all were negative for St. Louis, so the neutral stance he took didn't seem so neutral."
Cardinals,3cps53,civilaiden,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:37:45 2015 UTC,Seemed like a pretty fair break down of the situation to me. What would you have done differently to make it more neutral?
Cardinals,3cps53,Wifflebald,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:20:43 2015 UTC,"Haha I don't think I'm being clear. It is a VERY fair breakdown. My only point was they only highlighted a few situations where the Cards came out on bottom, as opposed to showing a few where they benefitted as well."
Cardinals,3coi5o,edubs_stl,5,Thu Jul 9 14:35:27 2015 UTC,Hot damn. He has 13.4 K/9 this season. Can't wait to see him once he's made it up to St. Louis.
Cardinals,3coi5o,Not_MyCabbages,8,Thu Jul 9 19:38:16 2015 UTC,13.4K/9 as a position player would be impossibly bad.

Cardinals,3coi5o,Ihateunerds,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:58:29 2015 UTC,"Rick Ankiel:       Richard Alexander Ankiel (/ˈæŋkiːl/; born July 19, 1979) is an American former professional baseball outfielder and pitcher. Ankiel played in Major League Baseball from 1999 through 2013 for the St. Louis Cardinals, Kansas City Royals, Atlanta Braves, Washington Nationals, Houston Astros, and New York Mets.  Ankiel was a pitcher with the Cardinals from 1999 until 2004, when he lost his ability to throw strikes consistently. After trying to regain his pitching form in the minor leagues, he switched to the outfield in early 2005. For two and a half years, he honed his skills as a hitter and fielder in the Cardinals' minor-league system. He returned to the Cardinals on August 9, 2007. As a Cardinal (1999–2009), Ankiel hit 47 home runs as an outfielder and two as a pitcher. After the 2009 season, Ankiel became a free agent. Subsequently, he was signed by the Royals and later was traded to the Braves.  Ankiel became the first player since Babe Ruth to have won at least 10 games as a pitcher and also hit at least 50 home runs. Ankiel is also the only player other than Ruth to both start a postseason game as a pitcher and hit a home run in the postseason as a position player. His change of position, and the fact that he played for six teams in a five-season span, suggest that Ankiel's playing history represents ""one of the stranger careers in baseball history"" in the words of journalist Barry Petchesky.

Cardinals,3coqfc,SayHeyRay,2,Thu Jul 9 20:18:42 2015 UTC,"So if he passes through waivers, will he still be on the AA team (with perhaps a very slim hope of a turnaround) or are we going to pay him 8 million to not play?"
Cardinals,3coqfc,t-poke,5,Thu Jul 9 20:32:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I think I've seen it written elsewhere that we likely DFA-ed him with the notion that: 1) it'd open up a spot on the 40-man roster and 2) no one would likely pick him up, since he's owed so much, and we'd  by default get to keep him."

This was the first series in a long time that I felt the rivalry with the Cubs, and it's great to have that competitiveness back.  But at the same time, there was so much bitterness, vote brigading, and all around poisonous behavior in both subs.  I even got a little caught up in it yesterday.  I understand that everyone watches the game differently, but if you antagonize another team's subreddit - whether directly or indirectly - you don't deserve to complain about the vitriol towards us in /r/baseball.  Because you're doing the same damn thing.    GO CARDINALS"

Sitting in Wrigley right before it happened you could just feel it coming. That moment, right when something big is going to happen, there's just brief silence and you feel that change in the mood, the atmosphere, like a slight chill and BAM. It happens. And it's Beautiful. Had moments like that in Busch, and watching from home or at a bar. But my first time at Wrigley and at top of 9th full count, after all that happened earlier. I thought I would die. I thought my grandma might die. Before that the stadium was thundering with dueling chants of ""Let's go Cubbies/Cardinals"". That hit happens and the Cards fans went insane.

Cardinals,3cmu8r,letuotter,2,Thu Jul 9 06:09:56 2015 UTC,"I have a shameful story to share.  My girlfriend (die-hard Cardinals fan) and I went to the game last night. And we left in the bottom of the 8th.  I know.  In our defense we had to go move her car or it would've gotten towed, and we were also getting constantly jeered by a really fat and incredibly rude group of Cubs fans sitting next to us. One guy was so fat that he spilled into half of my seat.  Anyway. We made mistakes. I apologize. Go Cards."
Cardinals,3cn5z9,sjrossman0,15,Thu Jul 9 05:10:18 2015 UTC,Im real excited  (mostly scared) of what the next 5 years look like with Cards and Cubs rivalry.  Its great for baseball. Its great for the NL Central (don't forget about Pitt).   September is going to be good this year.
Cardinals,3cn5z9,meowmeowtits,8,Thu Jul 9 05:26:18 2015 UTC,It's good to have the rivalry alive and kicking again! :)
Cardinals,3cn5z9,SGT_Apone,7,Thu Jul 9 05:46:05 2015 UTC,"Get used to that buzz around Wrigley - that is one heck of a lineup of young talent. I went to see Bryant play at the minor league park in my city 2 seasons ago, and was bummed when he didn't start. Addison Russell is from my area, went to prom with a good friend of my family, and is a great kid that we are following and rooting for (even in Cubs blue!). It's easy to get salty about tough series like this, and I may get hated on by other Cards' fans for saying this - but if the Cubs ever advance and we are out of it, I see myself rooting for them to go all the way. I have some great friends that are Cubs fans and I'd be happy to see them experience a championship."
Cardinals,3cn5z9,anthnysix,3,Thu Jul 9 15:17:13 2015 UTC,"do you remember what Sox fans were like after they beat us in the WS? Just imagine that times a trillion. when they crack this nut (which I fear will be very, very soon) they are going to be unbearable."
Cardinals,3cn5z9,beetbear,2,Thu Jul 9 17:05:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have quite a few Boston fans as friends as well, and I have to admit - I am sick of losing to them. They can suck it... but we would never face the Cubs in the World Series. However, I guess it's quite possible we could face them in a playoff round now, which I've never really considered before. That could get quite ugly, you're right."
Cardinals,3cn5z9,anthnysix,5,Thu Jul 9 18:07:20 2015 UTC,Shout out to all my friendly Cardinals fans in the gamethread. Y'all are awesome and I think I'll miss y'all. Despite the bitter rivalry you guys were still hospitable and a blast. Take care and enjoy your series with the Pirates!

Cardinals,3cknke,meowmeowtits,4,Wed Jul 8 18:01:42 2015 UTC,"It's years not number of moves. IIRC, he debuted in 2013 so this would be the remaining (3rd) year is infinite moves (unless he was on the 40 man roster in 2012 but I don't think he was). /u/kuhanluke correct me if I am wrong."
Cardinals,3cknke,DlSCOSTU,2,Wed Jul 8 19:00:23 2015 UTC,"This is correct AFAIK. Also, it's counted from when you exhaust your rookie eligibility, not your debut. Pretty sure that was still 2013 for him, but like Grichuk still has all of his options because he is a rookie this year.   Not sure about that either, but I'm pretty sure I'm right."
Cardinals,3cknke,kuhanluke,2,Wed Jul 8 19:10:30 2015 UTC,"Not how options work, options work for a year. So a player gets three YEARS of being optioned to triple A before they have to be DFA'd. It's not a set number of moves, it's a set number of YEARS where you're allowed to make moves freely.   This is Lyons third year of options."
Cardinals,3cknke,fps916,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"If you are talking about the last 2 The Shows, they work this way as well; but remember that everyone on your 40 man gets called up during spring training burning an option for that year."

Cardinals,3cl5bu,kuhanluke,13,Wed Jul 8 22:22:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair .240 is pretty abysmal for a lefty specialist. Like, that's what I'd expect out of a decent to good starter."
Cardinals,3cl5bu,jdbozeman,2,Wed Jul 8 23:20:42 2015 UTC,That's fine. But to loosely shit on him for the past two years is idiotic and asinine and shows people's ignorance. It's mind numbing ky infuriating.

Cardinals,3cl5bu,bravo_delta,7,Thu Jul 9 00:22:51 2015 UTC,.240 against his supposed specialty? That is pretty fucking abysmal
Cardinals,3cl5bu,illinoisadvertising,-3,Wed Jul 8 22:29:07 2015 UTC,Okay. But not going to talk about the previous years and how egregious your statement was.
Cardinals,3cl5bu,KIRB__STOMP,5,Wed Jul 8 22:30:28 2015 UTC,Remind me again how well Chode shut down Ortiz in 2013.
Cardinals,3cl5bu,mlasn,7,Wed Jul 8 22:52:52 2015 UTC,Let's remember what Ortiz did to all of our pitchers in 2013. He batted like .600 against us.   I'm also assuming you're shitting on Choate because of yesterday where he faced S-S-L. The lefty was Rizzo who's batting above .300 against lefties this year.

Cardinals,3cl5bu,illinoisadvertising,2,Fri Jul 10 17:05:41 2015 UTC,I don't really think we should replace him but I would prefer to have someone that could pitch against RH hitters. I'm not sure if these kind of specialists have much role in baseball today.
Cardinals,3cl5bu,jdbozeman,4,Wed Jul 8 19:46:36 2015 UTC,He's a LOOGY. His exact reason for being in the team is LH batters and that is it.
Cardinals,3cl5bu,bdeneaux,4,Wed Jul 8 20:03:41 2015 UTC,except his role is actually a) get lefties occasionally and b) be left in a game and allow a shit ton of runs o righties every once in a while because matheny has given up
Cardinals,3cl5bu,BetterThanAFoon,2,Wed Jul 8 20:22:50 2015 UTC,*His Mathenaging role is.....   Last year the BP was ailing and Choate was used out of his role too often.... he looked bad because he just isn't versatile.  This year he's been used in his niche role and he was just fine until yesterday.....when he was used out of the role...
Cardinals,3cl5bu,dquizzle,2,Wed Jul 8 20:51:49 2015 UTC,He's been bad multiple times this season not just yesterday
Cardinals,3cl5bu,BetterThanAFoon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:31:12 2015 UTC,"Matheny already keeps one or 2 bullpen guys on ice. Plus, on a talented team with lots of guys who can get outs in the bullpen (like the Cardinals), you can keep a one out guy like Choate. A team who's starters don't go 6 or 7 regularly with a pen that scuffles? Not so much."

Cardinals,3cl5bu,Not_MyCabbages,8,Wed Jul 8 20:09:37 2015 UTC,Easy answer... an Mike Trout and a Clayton Kershaw.  Oh and I'd like a Buster Posey too.... to play 1st base and be ready to give Yadi off days
Cardinals,3cl5bu,fasterdriver,3,Wed Jul 8 20:45:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe make a 3 way trade where we give up Cooney for Kersh and Trout.  I'd be okay with it, I guess."
Cardinals,3cl5bu,beetbear,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:36:44 2015 UTC,I was thinking more along the lines of Koz for Trout and maybe that Hatley kid for Kershaw.  Oh and they better eat most of their contract costs.
Cardinals,3cl5bu,shefwed82,3,Thu Jul 9 03:43:51 2015 UTC,This guy right here knows what he's talking about.  Much better than that old Foon we had around here a while back.
Cardinals,3cl5bu,joystickenvy,5,Wed Jul 8 22:23:16 2015 UTC,"Mitch Moreland or Adam Lind are good 1B replacements that won't demand much in a trade, and if we're willing to give up a little more in a trade, Chris Davis or Edwin Encarnacion could potentially be looked at, since both those teams need immediate pitching help."
Cardinals,3cl5bu,illinoisadvertising,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:31:12 2015 UTC,I would think encarnacion would be untouchable. But I like the first two. Lind would be my ideal pickup but who knows with Mo. Doubt he makes the big move.
Cardinals,3cl5bu,Titus_Brutus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:38:11 2015 UTC,yea I'd take some Adam Lind right now if we could get him for the right price. Replacing what we have at 1st right now with a .900 OPS - YES PLEASE!
Cardinals,3cl5bu,Dustinss5,3,Thu Jul 9 19:11:13 2015 UTC,Offense. At first base would be nice. And maybe somewhere else also.
Cardinals,3cl5bu,ScroogeMcJones,4,Wed Jul 8 20:49:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know what's available and I'm not sure we really have the prospects to get what we need, but ideally, I'd like to see them pick up a first baseman of the future who could also help us out now. Nothing against Matt Adams, but I don't think he's what we need in terms of replacing lost production from Pujols/Berkman and Craig (when he was good)/Beltran. Barring that, I'd like to see them pick up someone who make consistent contact and can drive in runs. I don't care that much about the power thing. A guy who can give us 20 solo home runs isn't going to make that much difference. Too many guys striking out or GIDPing with runners on and Reynolds is neither making contact, nor hitting homers right now, or at least not enough of them to make up for his .230 average. Given that he has kind of a weak arm for a 3B, I'd also entertain moving Carpenter to 1B and finding another 3B if there was more options. Another starter would be nice also. Between Garcia and his injuries and Wacha and Martinez being young, I think we are going to need innings that i'd prefer to not come from our AAA options, but I think we can reach the playoffs with what we have...barring someone goes down for the season or something. Again, I'd love to see them pick up a guy who could not only help this season, but compete for Lackey's rotation spot next season, but not sure we have the prospects to get anyone good. Getting Holliday back should help the offense and if we could move Reynolds back to the bench, that would give more options to rest Carpenter...which I really think he needs this year."
Cardinals,3cl5bu,DontGiveUpTheDip,-6,Wed Jul 8 20:15:59 2015 UTC,Putting carpenter at first base is one if the worst ideas I've ever heard on this sub. But it's interesting to think about
Cardinals,3cl5bu,ScroogeMcJones,2,Thu Jul 9 05:35:02 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see us go after Dan Haren, another really solid SP that will go out there every 5th day and give you a good outing. He's pitching really well this year and won't cost as much as Cueto or Hamels."
Cardinals,3cl5bu,joystickenvy,3,Fri Jul 10 04:27:09 2015 UTC,"Infield depth to replace Pete ""the golden glove"" Kozma."
Cardinals,3cl5bu,pujolsrox11,2,Wed Jul 8 22:18:05 2015 UTC,"I think we all want offense and a pitching staff that doesn't have to be cycled through the DL every week but what can ya do? The big thing is 1st Base and I think Adams is great but he's not our long term guy. We can talk about his power for a while but when it comes down to it, this team has already proven that it can win without a big HR guy. We need someone who can get on base, stay healthy, and have long-term potential. That's not Reynolds or Adams.  I think Adams is a fine player and I may be in the wrong for saying this...but few players who are that big and heavy can make a long-term impact unless they're a DH. People say Adam Lind would be a decent option but what would we be willing to give up for a guy whose contract expires this year and who has had injuries that took him out for the season in the last few years? I'd say skip finding a first baseman as it is a difficult task, and efforts should be made to change things up internally or strengthen another part of our game. Scruggs can get more playing time and we can address 1B in the offseason.   Look for another starting pitcher if Wainwright won't come back this season and look for minor improvements on the bench. Most of our guys will be coming off the DL after the All Star Break with Wainwright and Adams potentially later in the season. We'll be ok, just been an unlucky streak of injuries this season."
Cardinals,3cl5bu,da_choppa,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:40:10 2015 UTC,"I read an article today on bleacher report that said we should trade Cooney for Ryan Howard with $45 million of his contract paid...does anyone else think that this would be an impossible deal to swing? I don't think it would be bad for this to happen, but I think that's a bit much for the Phils. Thought?"
Cardinals,3cl5bu,joystickenvy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:10:42 2015 UTC,I think there's a lot of speculation saying Howard wouldn't want to come to St. Louis because of family issues. He has a no-trade clause and I believe STL is one of the teams on his no-go list. Plus I don't think Cooney would be nearly enough to get Howard with the majority of his contract taken by the Phils...that's just wishful thinking
Cardinals,3cl5bu,beetbear,2,Thu Jul 9 01:43:33 2015 UTC,"I agree. The Phils are going to want either a decent prospect or two or to unload his contract, but I don't see them both accepting a mediocre prospect like Cooney and footing the bill for such a large part of his contract. Cooney is worth having for depth, but not the kind of guy you try to rebuild a franchise around."

Cardinals,3cje38,hail_satan666,4,Wed Jul 8 12:43:20 2015 UTC,"When evaluating the return on a deal, I think the advanced metrics don't mean nearly as much as the end result. That isn't to say that they aren't useful in determining how well someone pitched, or in giving a predictive value for how they'll do in the future. But think of it this way: would you rather pay someone 30 million dollars to get a Cy Young award, but lose more of his starts than you win, or pay someone to pitch well enough that your team wins when he pitches? And Kershaw isn't even Cy Young level right now. Lackey doesn't have a ton of wins either but I meant this more generally.  I think of this scenario with the Cubs and Lester a lot. It reminds me of the old Branch Rickey quote, ""We came in last with you and we would've come in last without you."" You have to think that even if the big money pitcher has a better WHIP and WAR and more strikeouts and a better FIP and xFIP and VORP and whatever else, you're still paying him money so that your team will win more games, and if they don't, was it really worth it? Who cares if it's a lot of good or bad luck, right? It's the results that matter."

It's pretty easy to spam votes with the At Bat app (I was shocked to discover that it does something besides delivering John Rooney's silky smooth voice to my speakers).

Cardinals,3ciael,Undeniably_Awesome,19,Wed Jul 8 03:17:48 2015 UTC,"Before everyone gets to bashing angel, fair/foul calls over the bag are not made by the plate umpire. The base umpires have everything over the bag and beyond. Additionally: that ball was fair."
Cardinals,3ciael,amanbaby,10,Wed Jul 8 03:13:28 2015 UTC,The Angel bashing just has to do with him being a shitty umpire in general.
Cardinals,3ciael,ChicagoKoolAid,3,Wed Jul 8 03:48:50 2015 UTC,I'm aware. Just don't want it to be misguided.
Cardinals,3ciael,letuotter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:58:02 2015 UTC,"Thought initially the ball looked foul, but upon a further look it appears it first bounced foul, then hit the line on the bounces both before and after the bag. But either way, something needs to be said about Reynolds giving up on it. He could've dove to stop it had he not assumed it to be foul. Plus, it's not like the ball was even that far outside the line to just stop running and assume it'll be called foul. Besides the pitcher getting tossed, that was the worst part of the whole sequence."
Cardinals,3ciael,Jollyman21,9,Wed Jul 8 15:45:40 2015 UTC,"Anger at umps aside, how the fuck is it that fair/foul can't be challenged?"
Cardinals,3ciael,t-poke,8,Wed Jul 8 03:10:09 2015 UTC,"there's almost literally no way to place the runners if you overturn a call, and the views are worse of the infield than the outfield."
Cardinals,3ciael,Jollyman21,4,Wed Jul 8 03:19:24 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. At least for ones like this, they wouldn't have to worry about where to put runners though."
Cardinals,3ciael,i4_D_4_Mi,11,Wed Jul 8 04:10:51 2015 UTC,"Apparently the rule is when the play is ""in front of the umpire"" you can't review it. I'll be honest I'm not so sure about it being fair."

Cardinals,3ciael,spark_,16,Wed Jul 8 03:13:36 2015 UTC,"Is it like a bunt where it can roll back fair. When a baseball hasn't passed a corner bag it can ""roll fair"" and where it's played it's called?"

Cardinals,3ciael,DlSCOSTU,5,Wed Jul 8 03:15:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it has to start fair, I think Russell's started foul but had wicked spin  Edit: To anybody reading this now, I stand corrected. If Russell's ball did go over the bag,  regardless of where the first bounce landed, it's fair. I've played ball my whole life, I can't believe I had this rule wrong this whole time."

Cardinals,3ciael,huanthewolfhound,2,Wed Jul 8 03:20:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Cooney looked good. And while the fair/foul situation didn't help, the Cardinals still had ample opportunity to win that game. It almost never comes down to one single play. Having Holliday back will be great."
Cardinals,3ciael,GrubFisher,3,Wed Jul 8 03:09:21 2015 UTC,"Well on the plus side, Cooney looked good. Bad calls were made, but it happens to everybody.

Cardinals,3ciael,fre1102,2,Wed Jul 8 04:17:05 2015 UTC,scale from 1-10 concern level regarding Marp
Cardinals,3ciael,STL_Sports_Fan,3,Wed Jul 8 03:10:38 2015 UTC,10.  Something just isn't right and it's at least partially mental.   He never used to swing at the first pitch
Cardinals,3ciael,fre1102,3,Wed Jul 8 03:12:27 2015 UTC,a solid 7.  9 if he doesn't collect at least one RBI by the AS break.
Cardinals,3ciael,STL_Sports_Fan,4,Wed Jul 8 03:15:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not terribly concerned with Marp yet. He's slumping horribly, but until he finishes a year like this, I'm calling it just a slump. As it is he's 'slumped' to just missing the All Star game. I wish more of our guys would 'slump' like that.  I'm far more concerned about Heyward. I don't think he's the real deal at all, I'm very concerned John Mozeliak doesn't see it."
Cardinals,3ciael,fre1102,3,Wed Jul 8 03:23:16 2015 UTC,"interesting, i think heyward isn't pressing as much and as a result is more relaxed at the plate. he is settling in quite nicely but only time will tell and i have no idea what Mo will do"
Cardinals,3ciael,columbusplusone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:15:14 2015 UTC,"I really do think Heyward's primary problem is that he's pressing, trying to get his paycheck. But no matter the reason, the numbers aren't there. JD Drew had unlimited potential too. Until you can turn it into something, it doesn't matter why you can't."
Cardinals,3ciael,fre1102,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:17:29 2015 UTC,"fair enough but if i had to guess, i would say Mo will pass on him and some team will shell out way too much to land him."

Cardinals,3ciael,letuotter,0,Wed Jul 8 03:30:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly--he had to go on an actual tear to get people to stop questioning why he was even on the team. After Heyward's hot streak, I'm only grudgingly willing to acknowledge he's not a worse idea than Grichuk.  I'm just stunned people--completely seriously--think we should give him $20M/year. Or even anything more than $10M/year."
Cardinals,3ciael,da_choppa,0,Wed Jul 8 03:16:09 2015 UTC,"he IS a slump, he's just playing above the mean right now."

Cardinals,3ciael,Ponsman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:24:15 2015 UTC,"Heyward is killing it right now. All of his rate stats are being brought down by his bad April, but he's been great of late, and I think he will keep it up."
Cardinals,3ciael,da_choppa,-2,Wed Jul 8 03:25:46 2015 UTC,"Heyward is killing it right now.   Right now. I'm waiting to see how long it lasts.   All of his rate stats are being brought down by his bad April   And May, and half of June.   but he's been great of late   Pete Kozma had a few good weeks too. We're not acting like he's a superstar.   and I think he will keep it up.   I'm waiting until the end of the year (and even then I don't want to re-sign him for what he wants)."
Cardinals,3ciael,XC_Stallion92,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:09:30 2015 UTC,"No, you just don't understand how rate stats work. He had a terrible April, but his other months have all been good. However, his overall rate stats are only now looking good because a bad start drags it down. It's like getting an F on your first test of the semester, then averaging an A the rest of the semester. Eventually, you'll be able to pull your overall average to a low A, but it will take a while. Don't believe me? See for yourself with his monthly splits.  And no, Kozma did not have a few good weeks, he had A good game, so that comparison is ludicrous.  I really felt bad for Heyward when he had his April, because I knew there would be tons of fans like you who would believe he's been shit for half the year despite hitting quite well for May, June, and July so far, because you only look at his overall rate stat line and don't understand just how long it takes to dig out of a .217/.261/.349 hole. If he had that month in June rather than April, he'd be Matt Carpenter (whose June was worse than Heyward's April, FWIW).   And yes, everyone's waiting until the end of the year, but I'm optimistic about his upside, because he's still young. He turns 26 in August. There are rookies his age, and I don't think it's far fetched to believe he can and will get even better than he already is (which is damn good, btw).   He is a known quantity and a good one that could get better. There's value in that. Let's look ahead to the future of our outfield. You've got Holliday, who is 35 and signed through next season with a team option for 2017. He's not going to be around forever. You've got Jay, who is having a bad year at age 30 and is signed through next year. You've got Bourjos, 28, speedy, good glove, noodle bat (but one that once hit .271/.327/.438) signed through the end of this year. You've got Grichuk, who has the raw power you want, but needs to learn contact (he's only 23 and under team control for a long time, so  he's probably part of the long term plan). There's Pham, who is older than Heyward at 27! Which even surprises me, to be honest. Well, he's still an unknown quantity. His defense is reputed to be good, and his bat is reputed to be good in AAA, but we don't have enough MLB data yet, and like I said, he's 27, not what you'd call old yet, but no spring chicken either. And there's Piscotty, also 23, but still in AAA working on his swing to get some big league power. He has a rocket for an arm, but we have even less MLB data on him than Pham. He is expected to get a cup of coffee in September, but who knows how he fits into long term plans at this point?  Including Heyward, that's 7 outfielders, which is a lot. You can field an outfield without Heyward, sure. But unless Bourjos re-signs, he's gone after this year, and Holliday and Jay may very well be gone after next. Which leaves you with potentially 4 outfielders (the amount you need) beyond 2016 if Heyward is extended. But Pham and Piscotty are question marks because they lack MLB exposure, and even Grichuk could become any hitter from Dave Kingman to Joc Pederson to Jim Edmonds. Heyward has established a floor that is a decent bat with a great glove, with the youth to grow into a great bat with a decent glove as he gets older. I wouldn't sign him at any cost, but I'd give him more than you are likely willing to sign him for, and I think it makes sense: the Cardinals have a lot of money coming off the books as well as a new lucrative TV deal to look forward to. Payroll should be going up, and player contracts have already inflated to the point where Holliday's contract, once thought of as a crazy overspend by some, is now almost universally considered a steal (and has been considered such for a few years now). So I say sign the man. We're going to have the money, and we could use some certainty."
Cardinals,3ciael,mehx1000,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:00:49 2015 UTC,"You're wasting your breath with analysis here. Some people just have a raging hard-on for knocking on Heyward. It's the same type of people that threw a fit when we signed Holliday for ""way too much money"". It's the same type of people who were advocating that Kozma start over Peralta last year when he struggled out of the gate.  It's all ""hunch and feel"" and no analytics.  I trust Mo will make the right decision, but it certainly won't be based on some guys ability to ""see"" the real deal."
Cardinals,3ciael,letuotter,2,Wed Jul 8 15:41:46 2015 UTC,"That's precisely why I got carried away with that comment. It really pisses me off, because I know there's that portion of the Cardinals fan base that only remembers what happened first, and it really makes me sad for Heyward. If he had switched his June and April numbers, no one would be questioning him, but people look at his cumulative slash line and assume it's somehow indicative of how hot he is at the moment, and not, you know, an average of the whole season. These people either don't watch all the games or have very selective memory. Heyward had a shit April, good May, great June, and is off to an even better July. If you slump in June, it's a slump. If you slump in April, apparently you are just shitty. SMH"

Cardinals,3ciael,letuotter,2,Thu Jul 9 13:11:46 2015 UTC,"A little concerned, but I think the problem is that Marp thinks that he has to carry this team right now, and it's changing his approach.     Maybe he should go back to leadoff when Holliday gets back.   He's batting .373 when in the leadoff spot.   He's batting .234 while hitting 2nd."
Cardinals,3ciael,dumonsl,2,Wed Jul 8 03:19:18 2015 UTC,"the umps sucked tonight, but they don't get the ""W"" in tomorrow's box score.  our offense—while slightly better today—is still in utter freefall, and we're relying on replacement-level (at best) players and god-tier pitching to support us.  Where the hell has Marp gone?  Where has Yadi gone?  Why do we not work counts, and foul off close pitches, and hit and run with reckless abandon now?  What's with this first-pitch-hacking crap?  Why is our best hitter only hitting .260 and change with RISP, and much, much worse with 2 outs?  I dunno about tomorrow, or even the Pirates series.  But there'd better be some yelling during the AS break, because this is not an adequate effort from pros.  Production is what production is, but the effort and the approach are shite."

Cardinals,3ciael,F117Nighthawk,3,Wed Jul 8 03:08:42 2015 UTC,"Meh. They beat us at our worst. We threw out a couple of AAA guys and still made it interesting. Nothing a good dose of Wacha can't fix.   Also, they always play us tough @ Wrigley. It'll be interesting when I visit Wrigley in Sept. Let's see if they'll have anything to play for then."

Cardinals,3ciael,Michael__Pemulis,-5,Wed Jul 8 04:02:12 2015 UTC,Cubs announcer just said the Cubs swept us. I think he is confused.
Cardinals,3ciael,F117Nighthawk,25,Wed Jul 8 03:53:20 2015 UTC,Double-header sweeps are a thing
Cardinals,3ciael,i4_D_4_Mi,3,Wed Jul 8 03:09:27 2015 UTC,Shouldn't be. Two game series sweeps shouldn't even be a thing.
Cardinals,3ciael,F117Nighthawk,5,Wed Jul 8 03:10:02 2015 UTC,I believe it is because the thinking is that double-headers are harder to sweep than a two game series. I'm sure it dates back to when double-headers were rather common.
Cardinals,3ciael,toastdispatch,8,Wed Jul 8 03:12:47 2015 UTC,I totally get it...but I don't like it. Sweeps to me will always be winning all of the games in a series that at least is three games or more.  That's my opinion of course. Not necessarily agreed upon by all.

Cardinals,3ciael,Stommped,-1,Wed Jul 8 03:54:47 2015 UTC,"Just saw that BS fair call.  Don't know how you ever call that fair, it was foul the entire way."
Cardinals,3ciael,Cest_La_Vie21,7,Wed Jul 8 03:09:53 2015 UTC,"I was at the game sitting along the foul line behind home plate, and it was very obviously fair from there. It rolled foul after hitting the base, but everyone in the area (including tons of Cards fans) agreed that it was fair."
Cardinals,3ciael,fre1102,8,Wed Jul 8 04:00:52 2015 UTC,"hey, Cubs fan here. I come in peace haha. I came to say today was good day of baseball (but after reading some comments, I'd also like to give my input on this fair ball thing). although yall have injured players, yall put up a hell of a fight and quite honestly couldve won that second game. however, I think (I'm not 100% certain) it's fair because although the first bounce was foul, the 2nd bounce was fair, then went over first base. which makes it fair. can anyone confirm? not like it matters, but there's a lot of confusion so I'm curious. anyways, good luck tomorrow and fuck angel Hernandez!"
Cardinals,3ciael,columbusplusone,6,Wed Jul 8 13:00:59 2015 UTC,"confirmed. It matters not where the ball first bounces (unless its off the player or the plate) but it matters where the ball is according to the bag, if it hops over the bag its fair."
Cardinals,3ciael,uhhhhmmmm,2,Wed Jul 8 04:28:35 2015 UTC,"Well if hits off the player it's dead immediately, but it doesn't necessarily matter per se if ball hits home plate first, it doesn't make the ball automatically fair.  It's possible to hit a ball off home plate and then have it roll foul down the line."
Cardinals,3ciael,columbusplusone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:40:47 2015 UTC,"Fuck Angel Hernandez!  Ya my confusion lies on how far in does it need to go over the base?  I agree it went over the base, but I think it went on the outer half of it.  I guess it all depends on that ruling."

Cardinals,3ciael,columbusplusone,3,Wed Jul 8 03:17:04 2015 UTC,i mean we'll get downvoted to hell because /r/baseball hates us
Cardinals,3ciael,maxelrod,0,Wed Jul 8 03:21:20 2015 UTC,I posted it because I am interested to see what they think too. I think it's foul since it bounces foul first but I need a refresher on that rule. Umps have been awful this series. The strike zone is all over the fucking place.   https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/3cj0ce/fair_or_foul_on_addison_russells_game_tying_rbi/
Cardinals,3ciael,amanbaby,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:10:51 2015 UTC,"The rule is that fair/foul on the infield is determined by where the ball stops moving or is picked up. But on a ball that leaves the infield after bouncing in the infield, the ball is fair if it passes over the bag (in fair territory). That's the argument here; I don't think anyone disputes that it clearly bounces foul at least once, but the spin on the ball and the camera angles available make the remaining trajectory difficult to interpret for the fans at home. The umpire judged that the ball passed over the bag, therefore it was a fair ball, and due likely to those same technological limitations, MLB has decreed that this play is not a reviewable play (which is a damn shame if you ask me, because fair/foul is literally the most cut-and-dried play in the sport and its interpretation should not ever have to be controversial)."
Cardinals,3ciael,Stommped,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:13:35 2015 UTC,That's a solid explanation. Thanks.   Does it bounce on the line right before going over the bag?
Cardinals,3ciael,columbusplusone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:55:44 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm not really sure about. It certainly hit either on the line or immediately to the foul side, that much I could see from the video. That's what's irked Cardinals fans about this call, the bounce in front of the bag and the bounce past the bag both seem to have been possibly in foul territory, which means then by simple deduction that the ball should not have been able to pass over the bag. But again, the camera angles available just don't show any if that clearly enough for there to be complete certainty one way or the other."
Cardinals,3ciael,Stommped,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:29:54 2015 UTC,Yes. It's on the line on that last bounce before the bag.
Cardinals,3cfw0b,SchoenKills,14,Tue Jul 7 16:25:12 2015 UTC,"Who's the guy on the team who gives them the most ridiculous order containing all the Starbucks jargon? Wacha? Also, does Carlos even know how to accept a beverage?"

Cardinals,3chc01,UNIFight2013,3,Wed Jul 8 03:03:01 2015 UTC,WHY DID NOBODY TAG?
Cardinals,3chc01,Evownz,3,Wed Jul 8 03:02:54 2015 UTC,Not worth risking the out for runs that are meaningless. Both of the runners and the guy at the plate have to score so theres no sense in risking an out and needing another baserunner to tie it up.
Cardinals,3chc01,UNIFight2013,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:03:44 2015 UTC,Risking the out? You think there was a chance in hell of Grichuk getting gunned down from right field? Wasn't a risk.
Cardinals,3chc01,toastdispatch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:10:48 2015 UTC,He probably wouldn't have but what is there to gain if he does go? The run that's two short of the tying run is 90 feet closer and the tying run is still at the plate.

Cardinals,3cgw0e,MrLuxuryYacht,4,Tue Jul 7 20:35:19 2015 UTC,He made another great catch but banged up the side of his head.
Cardinals,3cgw0e,columbusplusone,2,Tue Jul 7 20:37:27 2015 UTC,I suppose it'll be good for him to get the rest of the day/maybe another day off. Keep him healthy and well-rested
Cardinals,3cgw0e,kuhanluke,2,Tue Jul 7 20:42:31 2015 UTC,Did they say how bad it was on the broadcast?
Cardinals,3cgw0e,columbusplusone,3,Tue Jul 7 20:53:13 2015 UTC,I suppose calling it a contusion rather than a concussion is at least a good sign
Cardinals,3cgw0e,mobius160,2,Tue Jul 7 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"all they said was ""contusion"""
Cardinals,3cgw0e,MrLuxuryYacht,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:58:19 2015 UTC,Just said he had a contusion.  Didn't watch any post-game so I don't know if there are any updates beyond that.  Probably not too serious.  Wouldn't be surprised if he sits out game 2 and is back tomorrow.
Cardinals,3cgw0e,12in15,2,Tue Jul 7 20:59:35 2015 UTC,I saw a little of the post game.  They talked to Wong and he kinda brushed it off as not a big deal.  Think Wong said he felt ok to play but it was up to Matheny.  Matheny didn't rule him out for tonight and said they're doing tests to see.  (Information may be slightly inaccurate as I heard it in the background and wasn't paying a lot of attention.)

Cardinals,3cfrmv,Michael__Pemulis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:27:26 2015 UTC,Whoa now. He's barely hitting over .200 and has less RBI's than Adams had when he went down.  (albeit in fewer PA's so far)  I don't think he qualifies as MUCH better than Adams.  Especially not since Adams is still on the younger side and has the potential to get better.

Cardinals,3cfrmv,TheBostonPops,2,Tue Jul 7 20:13:59 2015 UTC,Then hey more power to you... but you could say the same for the Blues and most Blues fans won't pretend they're not perennially salty as fuck toward the Blackhawks.  It's hard to stay content with your rival team dicking around in your front yard with all their championship trophies.

That's just me of course."
Cardinals,3cfrmv,TheBostonPops,3,Tue Jul 7 20:20:15 2015 UTC,"Generations of disappointment don't disappear with one good team. A lot of the Cubs' identity comes from disliking the Cardinals. They have a lot of nice fans, but the saltiness stays prominent."

Cardinals,3cfrmv,1859,2,Tue Jul 7 20:41:13 2015 UTC,I hope nobody ever says a lot of the identity of the Cardinals comes from disliking the Cubs (or any other team). Your identity should never be based off of another team.
Cardinals,3cfrmv,TheBostonPops,2,Tue Jul 7 20:43:37 2015 UTC,"Really? I'd argue that our rivalry with the Cubs is one of the coolest, most storied rivalries in sports and absolutely makes up a portion of what it means to be a Cardinals fan and vis-versa.  It's the kind of thing that makes a regular July series feel like October.  And for a lot of people it's not so much pure ""dislike"" as it is friendly competition."
Cardinals,3cfrmv,F117Nighthawk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"Oh the rivalry is totally a part of our identity. It isn't based on another team, but a great competition that I have found to be fun over the years. But that isn't saying our identity is based on a dislike for another team."

Cardinals,3cdymz,Cest_La_Vie21,11,Tue Jul 7 04:11:37 2015 UTC,I'm kind of glad they didn't call it.  Got to see Grich get a nice hit.  Still a bit worried about tomorrow considering our starters.
Cardinals,3cdymz,kuhanluke,7,Tue Jul 7 04:10:26 2015 UTC,Fresh bullpen though.
Cardinals,3cdymz,BackInRed,0,Tue Jul 7 04:21:39 2015 UTC,"Let Villanueva get like 4 innings tomorrow, hopefully Lyons and Cooney can go 10 innings between them, shouldn't be too bad."
Cardinals,3cdymz,Birdsonbat,10,Tue Jul 7 05:51:57 2015 UTC,"Reallllly glad we won that one. I'm not too confident going into a double header with Lyons (against Arrieta) and Cooney as our starters.  Lackey has been such a phenomenal pickup. It's been said a million times, but DAMN that was a great trade.  Kolten Wong is life."

Cardinals,3cdymz,fps916,5,Tue Jul 7 04:11:44 2015 UTC,"Kolten Wong's DP was one of the best plays I've seen in a long time.

Cardinals,3cdymz,ToMiz9,3,Tue Jul 7 04:19:17 2015 UTC,I just love how Wong showed himself tonight. Many of my friends who are Cubs fans don't really have an idea of who he is and that's an absolute stud

Cardinals,3cdymz,fps916,2,Tue Jul 7 04:15:44 2015 UTC,He does strike out too much. But he's young and hopefully will get that ironed out in years to come. When he puts bat on ball it's electric every time.
Cardinals,3cdymz,bustysteclair,2,Tue Jul 7 04:19:40 2015 UTC,"So he's Joc Pederson without the power or walks? Yeah, that sounds about right."
Cardinals,3cdymz,zakmac85,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:55:51 2015 UTC,Grich has a higher slugging percentage than Joc.
Cardinals,3cdymz,kuhanluke,2,Tue Jul 7 14:22:49 2015 UTC,"For me, it's not so much THAT he strikes out, but HOW. Swings at lots of pitches nowhere near the strike zone. He will get more disciplined with ABs. Still love him!"
Cardinals,3cdymz,bustysteclair,2,Tue Jul 7 17:43:28 2015 UTC,"Also, I upvoted you. I understand you're playing devil's advocate here."

Cardinals,3cdymz,kuhanluke,5,Tue Jul 7 04:18:00 2015 UTC,He also walked twice as much
Cardinals,3cdymz,umbrellaguns,7,Tue Jul 7 04:20:53 2015 UTC,"He also had 48% XBH compared to Grichuk's 58% this year.   I'm just saying, a guy that strikes out a little more, walks less, and hits XBH at a higher rate than the best player in baseball (with plus defense and plus speed) is pretty damn good to have."
Cardinals,3cdymz,kuhanluke,3,Tue Jul 7 04:26:50 2015 UTC,"Grichuk is a maddening player; he'll have Sale's number one day, and then proceed to have multiple strikeouts against some random 5th rotation guy."
Cardinals,3cdymz,umbrellaguns,7,Tue Jul 7 04:31:31 2015 UTC,Absolutely. He's also a 23 year old rookie and he never lets his struggles at the plate affect his defense or vice-versa.
Cardinals,3cdymz,kuhanluke,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:33:02 2015 UTC,He just needs to add one more outcome to his two true ones.
Cardinals,3cdymz,bustysteclair,2,Tue Jul 7 07:17:26 2015 UTC,"three true outcomes: homer, single, double. Walks are for pussies."
Cardinals,3cdymz,Cochise22,2,Tue Jul 7 07:18:36 2015 UTC,He has almost as many triples as homers

Cardinals,3ceoa2,Getz15,2,Tue Jul 7 12:55:18 2015 UTC,Looks like things got serious after I went to sleep last night.
Cardinals,3ceoa2,ashlicrowe,5,Tue Jul 7 14:25:12 2015 UTC,"So I went through the Cubs GDT for kicks late last night, and got to the part where Wong's glorious DP occurred. It seems Kozma serves a purpose of confusing people because they hate him so much."

Cardinals,3ceoa2,iamadacheat,6,Tue Jul 7 14:08:02 2015 UTC,"If you ignore advanced metrics, LeMahieu and Wong are about even.  Not saying you should ignore advanced metrics, but I think that explains it.  I'm not mad because Wong is gonna make the next 10 All Star games so it's whatever."
Cardinals,3ceoa2,BromCJ,6,Tue Jul 7 09:26:02 2015 UTC,And he's also playing in coors...

Cardinals,3ceoa2,abomb2323,4,Tue Jul 7 14:24:48 2015 UTC,LaMahieu had a hot start.
Cardinals,3ceoa2,kuhanluke,2,Tue Jul 7 14:35:39 2015 UTC,"Marp had a really hot start too. With the way Wong's been playing, I'd have liked to see him get it."
Cardinals,3ceoa2,sicalloverthem,3,Tue Jul 7 09:57:07 2015 UTC,Marp had a huge slump following his hot start and Arenado and Bryant did not. There were four 3Bs who deserved to go and they were only going to take three.

Cardinals,3cd8b5,Stephen_Piscotty,20,Tue Jul 7 00:24:02 2015 UTC,Does anyone else feel like CarMart deserves this All-Star Selection more than Wacha?
Cardinals,3cd8b5,Mr_Baseball_13,15,Tue Jul 7 00:32:18 2015 UTC,I feel like Lynn deserves it more than either.
Cardinals,3cd8b5,evanb_,6,Tue Jul 7 00:43:08 2015 UTC,Agreed.
Cardinals,3cd8b5,burts_beads,4,Tue Jul 7 00:44:30 2015 UTC,"Yup. Better ERA, FIP, xFIP, K%, SIERA, and fWAR than Wacha. But you know, Wacha has dem Wins."
Cardinals,3cd8b5,thatoneguy211,5,Tue Jul 7 03:08:06 2015 UTC,Lynn doesn't have the will to win. Wacha leads the league in this stat.  Edit: apparently this needed a /s. I thought it was kinda obvious that was sarcasm
Cardinals,3cd8b5,Davidfreeze,3,Tue Jul 7 13:10:18 2015 UTC,I actually think Wacha has been the best of the three but all their stats are pretty much identical.
Cardinals,3cd8b5,mlasn,5,Tue Jul 7 01:57:51 2015 UTC,"I feel like CarMart has been the best pitcher on the staff all season, but his stats don't support it :/"
Cardinals,3cd8b5,fps916,7,Tue Jul 7 03:36:43 2015 UTC,"That's because CarMart is by FAR the most improved. Lynn is low-end ace quality, Wacha has an ace ceiling, and Carmart was the 5th/6th guy with a 4+ ERA that was often relegated to the pen. CarMart has been performing LEAPS AND BOUNDS better than he previously had. The others are just showing what we know them to be."
Cardinals,3cd8b5,BromCJ,3,Tue Jul 7 05:22:41 2015 UTC,This is actual Carlos Martinez we expected. Not some long relief pitcher.

I really think that overall he's been one of the best second baseman in the league, he's almost hitting .300, he's got pop, he's stolen a few bases, and he's been money defensively. Oh well."
Cardinals,3ccysv,galenb,5,Mon Jul 6 23:11:52 2015 UTC,"Pitcher's to still be announced, so I expect to see Rosie and Wacha."
Cardinals,3ccysv,packfan567,4,Mon Jul 6 23:13:33 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess it would be an even bigger robbery if the best pitching staff in years didn't have a single pitcher on the All-Star team.
Cardinals,3ccysv,GrubFisher,21,Mon Jul 6 23:16:00 2015 UTC,"Carpenter I understand, but not Wong? The NL just brimming with good hitting 2basemen who field like gods?"
Cardinals,3ccysv,sober_virgin,2,Mon Jul 6 23:12:14 2015 UTC,DJ and Panik are good hitting 2nd baseman who field incredibly well.
Cardinals,3ccysv,evanb_,9,Mon Jul 6 23:22:10 2015 UTC,"DJ LeMahieu is a below-average hitter this year, and one of the worst-hitting 2B over the course of his career."
Cardinals,3ccysv,williampum98,2,Tue Jul 7 00:42:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's below-average at all this year. Before today's games started, he's listed at hitting .298 with 4 HR, 10 SB, 34 RBI and 42 runs scored. Those seem like some solid numbers for someone playing 2B but I do still think Wong should have gotten in over him"
Cardinals,3ccysv,evanb_,3,Tue Jul 7 02:20:28 2015 UTC,"wRC+ of 98 and OPS+ of 93  solidly below average, average at best"
Cardinals,3ccysv,nufandan,2,Tue Jul 7 02:21:53 2015 UTC,"also, if you can only manage a .098 ISO while playing for the Rockies (only .060 on the road!), a .298 avg isn't going to mean much."

Cardinals,3ccysv,FatGuy_InALittleCoat,5,Mon Jul 6 23:44:05 2015 UTC,He's hitting in Colorado and still doesn't have the numbers of Wong. Big time snub by the players.
Cardinals,3ccysv,sober_virgin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:12:08 2015 UTC,I haven't checked in a while but the last time I looked his home/road splits weren't too dramatic.
Cardinals,3ccysv,nufandan,3,Mon Jul 6 23:57:31 2015 UTC,Home OPS: .832  Away OPS: .648  The .120 difference in home/away SLG is pretty dramatic for a player with no power.
Cardinals,3ccysv,sober_virgin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:30:53 2015 UTC,Okay then I stand corrected. Earlier in the year the splits weren't that dramatic. I guess the season caught up with him.
Cardinals,3ccysv,nufandan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:39:49 2015 UTC,"yeah, he started off hot overall relative to his typical batting lines, but since May has fallen back to earth.   Through May 1st: .417/.462/.542  Since May 1st: .265/.322/.345"

He has made quite a few errors and has really been struggling offensively for about a month and half.  Frazier has had a monster first half."
Cardinals,3ccysv,bmac92,2,Tue Jul 7 02:17:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah Carpenter I understand, I'm just not quite over being a little bitter about it. The three third basemen chosen were the right ones. Wong is a total snub."
Cardinals,3ccysv,kuhanluke,5,Tue Jul 7 02:52:58 2015 UTC,I'm not mad about Marp. He needs the break and the rest. Wong deserves it. I'm not sure how much longer he's going to keep flying under the radar.
Cardinals,3ccysv,Gizmocheeze,2,Tue Jul 7 13:28:28 2015 UTC,"After the concussion/not concussion, I think he needs a break too. He deserved it though, IMO. Carp on the other hand was beat fair an square. Can't make much of a case for him with his recent performance."
Cardinals,3ccysv,iamadacheat,3,Wed Jul 8 20:40:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm glad Marp didn't make the ASG. He has been in a massive slump for a while and some extended time off will do him good."
Cardinals,3ccysv,Wifflebald,4,Tue Jul 7 03:30:14 2015 UTC,Can't believe Carpenter didn't even make the final vote after leading the vote the whole year until the end.
Cardinals,3ccysv,Wifflebald,2,Mon Jul 6 23:59:55 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the recent headlines have at least a little bit to do with them being overlooked. Most people already dislike us and now they assume we are cheaters as well.
Cardinals,3ccysv,BromCJ,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:41:39 2015 UTC,"Panik is definitely deserving.  Wong is better than LeMahieu by advanced metrics, but at the end of the day LeMahieu is hitting near .300 and plays excellent defense.  Wong will have plenty more years to make the All Star team."
Cardinals,3ccysv,Wifflebald,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:19:35 2015 UTC,Joe Panik and DJ Lemahieu selected as the 2B reserves. Completely ridiculous.
Cardinals,3ccysv,fps916,8,Mon Jul 6 23:11:08 2015 UTC,Panik is deserving. Wong has been absent at the plate the last few weeks.
Cardinals,3ccysv,evanb_,6,Mon Jul 6 23:12:24 2015 UTC,"Same, I'm okay with Panik making it in, but not Lemahieu. Wong is leaps and bounds above him as a better player."
Cardinals,3ccysv,Wifflebald,3,Mon Jul 6 23:14:59 2015 UTC,I agree. That was out of left field(see what I did there?).
Cardinals,3ccysv,evanb_,0,Mon Jul 6 23:15:42 2015 UTC,Nobody said he wasn't. We're saying Wong should be over DJ.

Cardinals,3cag99,F117Nighthawk,5,Mon Jul 6 17:20:02 2015 UTC,Hawaiians fucking love SPAM. They fry it up and make a sort of 'spam sushi'. I forget the name for it.  I'm guessing they don't have any poke restaurants in CO where /u/F117Nighthawk is but that would be my other idea (a gift certificate to that).

Atlanta is nice, but to me it felt like a typical big city. I went to a Braves game though, so that was kind of cool.  I guess I loved Charleston and Savannah so much because of the history. I highly recommend going to Fort Sumter and touring a plantation home while in Charleston (Boone Hall was my favorite). Also, the food in downtown is the bomb. I love that place haha"

Cubs and Pirates for an 8 game road trip before the break.  How many guys will slack in any of these games, looking ahead at the break? Garcia's groin injury isn't as bad as it could be.  We need him back sooner rather than later...just like the last 7 times he hit the DL.   Unless Lyons and Cooney all of a sudden take the next step, Marco Gonzalez and his health is our only hope of having a strong 5 man rotation for the rest of the season. Matt Holliday has to come back and perform.  All of the veterans from Yadi, Peralta and Jay to Lynn, Choate and Rosenthal are responsible for the outcome of the second half of this season.  This goes double in games against the Pirates and Cubs.   If we find ourselves on the right side of all of this, hello win #100!"
Cardinals,3c88iq,12in15,3,Sun Jul 5 21:03:59 2015 UTC,"Cubs and Pirates for an 8 game road trip before the break. How many guys will slack in any of these games, looking ahead at the break?     I dont think slacking will be a problem.  Division games with good teams should keep the players focused.  I'd be more worried about slacking if we were playing bad teams.  However, I'm still worried about our offensive drought going into these important 8 games.     Garcia's groin injury isn't as bad as it could be. We need him back sooner rather than later...just like the last 7 times he hit the DL. Unless Lyons and Cooney all of a sudden take the next step, Marco Gonzalez and his health is our only hope of having a strong 5 man rotation for the rest of the season.     With the way our pitching has been, if wacha, martinez, lynn, and lackey keep it up, I'm not too worried about tossing Cooney or someone out there every 5th day.  Of course, we all want Garcia back, but I don't think it will be a key if our other starters remain healthy and effective.     Matt Holliday has to come back and perform. All of the veterans from Yadi, Peralta and Jay to Lynn, Choate and Rosenthal are responsible for the outcome of the second half of this season. This goes double in games against the Pirates and Cubs.     Hopeful Holliday comes back and can provide some much needed offense.  We need everyone, not just veterans, to pick up the offense, and take some of the pressure off our pitching."

Cardinals,3c88iq,redacted47,3,Sun Jul 5 20:44:21 2015 UTC,So why was the infield fly rule implemented on Wong's pop-up?
Cardinals,3c88iq,ToMiz9,6,Sun Jul 5 20:45:37 2015 UTC,It's only for multiple baserunners
Cardinals,3c88iq,redacted47,2,Sun Jul 5 20:47:31 2015 UTC,Ah.
Cardinals,3c88iq,MicCheck123,2,Sun Jul 5 20:49:21 2015 UTC,Technically it requires a force play at third. Runners at first and second third or second and third don't count.
Cardinals,3c88iq,1859,5,Sun Jul 5 21:15:17 2015 UTC,It wasn't because infield fly requires at least runners on first and second.  It's weird.
Cardinals,3c88iq,redacted47,3,Sun Jul 5 20:48:24 2015 UTC,I was unaware of the multiple runners rule.
Cardinals,3c88iq,1859,7,Sun Jul 5 20:49:50 2015 UTC,"There was a particular wild card game in 2012 that taught me the specifics of the infield fly.  I still don't fully understand the logic behind it. They don't think it be like it is, but it do."
Cardinals,3c88iq,redacted47,5,Sun Jul 5 20:55:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would really make a lot more sense if it were for any runners on base, but way she goes boys, fuckin' way she goes."
Cardinals,3c88iq,i4_D_4_Mi,2,Sun Jul 5 20:58:23 2015 UTC,"The reason it has to be runners on 1st AND 2nd is because with only a runner on 1st, the defense gains no advantage by letting an infield fly drop.  If they were to let it drop on purpose, sure they'd get the force out at 2nd, but the batter should be running enough that he'll be safe at first, eliminating the possibility of the double play.  On the contrary, with runners on 1st and 2nd (or bases loaded), the infielder could let the ball drop and then get a double or triple play, as the runners would be stuck on their original bases.  Does that make sense?"
Cardinals,3c88iq,redacted47,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:20:03 2015 UTC,Got it. Thanks.
Cardinals,3c88iq,i4_D_4_Mi,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:45:56 2015 UTC,No problem!
Cardinals,3c88iq,lakerdave,2,Mon Jul 6 13:47:39 2015 UTC,"It's such BS too because you shouldn't gain a huge competitive advantage from intentionally allowing a ball to drop on the infield. I mean with how close that was to the 2B bag, there was nothing Yadi could do to avoid the DP. If he runs out to second then they catch the ball, but if he stays they let it drop. I don't blame their 2B for doing what he did. It was totally within the rules, but that rule is BS."
Cardinals,3c88iq,UnwillingFather,3,Mon Jul 6 03:58:06 2015 UTC,The real issue was that Wong didn't run it out. If he had there wouldn't have been a double play and that's why the infield fly rule only applies to multiple baserunners.

Cardinals,3c7iwl,iamadacheat,21,Mon Jul 6 15:24:20 2015 UTC,Silver lining: it's completely unrelated to his arm.  He'll be back this season.  Edit: it's also retroactive to his last start I'm assuming.  Could just be that he needed a few more days so they put him on the DL to get another roster spot.  Edit again: nope it's backdated to July 4th.  No idea what the rule is there.  He's eligible to come back during the first series after the All Star break.

Cardinals,3c7iwl,civilaiden,17,Sun Jul 5 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"on the bright side, at least Garcia didn't try to hide his injury this time."
Cardinals,3c7iwl,ANAL_CAVITIES,13,Sun Jul 5 17:06:31 2015 UTC,That is how he got hurt in the first place. He was pitching with it and when Matheny asked him point blank how he was feeling Jaime hid it and then made it worse running the bases.
Cardinals,3c7iwl,civilaiden,2,Sun Jul 5 18:25:05 2015 UTC,Source?
Cardinals,3c7iwl,1859,5,Sun Jul 5 21:14:36 2015 UTC,"http://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/cardinal-beat/cards-power-up-as-garcia-cramps-up/article_8d9e7466-7179-5336-90d1-51e4347b2852.html   He insisted he was fine after the game, though his manager suggested Garcia could have avoided the scare altogether by sharing that his arm felt grand but his leg had lodged a complaint.  “Failed to mention it,” Matheny said. “If he would have even barely mentioned he had a cramp, he wouldn’t have been out there taking that at-bat. But he wanted to pitch. Said his arm felt great. He’s telling me the truth about that.”"
Cardinals,3c7iwl,dumonsl,8,Sun Jul 5 21:47:22 2015 UTC,He did pitch on it without telling the trainers.  But I guess that's a little better.
Cardinals,3c7iwl,Goldstubble,6,Sun Jul 5 17:39:31 2015 UTC,He's learning.

The only two times I've gotten autographs at a game was when there were a few guys set up in the walkways specifically for autographs. (It was announced as a promotion). They were current players, but not the popular ones at the time and it was pitchers. ( Rzep., Fernando salas, and Jaime Garcia oh, and tony Cruz. )  The other time was when we were sitting in the pricey once in a lifetime commissioners box and Jason motte actually came over and signed a ball for us and also Jose oquendo.   They do not sign after the game and only before, I think, if you have special credentials to be on the field.     I don't know if you can stand by the dugout before the game and get autographs. I feel like I've seen people do that but I'm pretty sure Yadi is usually closer to the bullpen warming up the pitcher before the game starts."
Cardinals,3c8vtz,readermom,8,Mon Jul 6 00:22:11 2015 UTC,That was really cool of Motte to sign a ball for Jose Oquendo.

Cardinals,3c8vtz,kuhanluke,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:06:14 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you do. We had tickets on the first base side last year and they check your tickets before they let you go down there. And Sam Freeman was the only player who even acknowledged the fans in the dugout before the game so chances aren't real good there either.
Cardinals,3c8vtz,gotsnow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:36:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I see what you mean about Yadi. Thanks for the info.
Cardinals,3c8vtz,Sdavis15,2,Mon Jul 6 04:47:52 2015 UTC,"By far your best chance to get a Yadi autograph is to go to the Winter Warm Up in January. It's definitely pricey but it's a cool event that's normally held over MLK weekend if I remember correctly.   As far as getting an autograph at the game, get there early. Probably two hours before the gates open and you can't be afraid to be aggressive getting down there. Not shoving little kids or anything, but just stand your ground.   Good luck!"
Cardinals,3c8vtz,gotsnow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:09:21 2015 UTC,I plan to be there plenty early. I hope at least a couple of the guys will make themselves available. If not I'll still be excited to be there. I'll do my best not to push little Billy to the ground :)

Cardinals,3c8vtz,Sam_the_Ram,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:37:43 2015 UTC,This is accurate. The gates used to open earlier but I believe it is now 1 hour (?) prior to game time. You can usually only catch a few rounds of BP from the visiting team.

Losing streaks suck, even when they're inevitable for a team who has been playing so well as the Cardinals have. Still, the offense looks terrible right now. Carpenter getting that hit with RISP was great, but the offense still isn't hitting well. In order to get the go-ahead run, the Cardinals had to reach base by error, steal a base, move to 3rd on a groundout, and then score on a sacrifice fly. That won't cut it against the upcoming series' against the Cubs and the Pirates. Hopefully the offense finds life again, and soon.  Also, CarMart is so much fucking fun to watch pitch."

Cardinals,3c4l7r,makagulfazel,6,Sun Jul 5 02:14:55 2015 UTC,"I'm reading through parts of Stuart Shea's great book ""Calling the Game"" - a history of each MLB team's broadcasters - and I came across this brief bit talking about the latest iteration of the TV side in the Cardinals section:  ""Horton has a likeable personality, though he is not an ideal play-by-play announcer.

I don't mind them.   I just turn the commentary down or off if I get sick of them.    I imagine everyone gets sick of their announcers at some point during the season.

Cardinals,3c4l7r,FatGuy_InALittleCoat,6,Tue Jul 7 11:41:56 2015 UTC,"Danny has grown on me. I hold the unpopular opinion of actually really enjoying when Tim McCarver is on broadcasts. Tim has seen so much and has so many great stories, I just think he's hilarious and I love listening to him. Al on the other hand, has totally fallen off. I can't stand listening to him. When he chimes in (which is all too often), he just seems to ramble. The Cardinals have so many awesome potential color guys that are hanging around the organization in former players, I just feel like we are settling with the Hungo."
Cardinals,3c4l7r,da_asparagus,2,Sat Jul 4 19:53:58 2015 UTC,I love when Tim talks about Bob Gibson and a lot of other Cardinal greats.

Cardinals,3c4l7r,Abyss_in_Motion,12,Sat Jul 4 21:26:49 2015 UTC,"I'm 100% with you. I don't like when broadcasters editorialize anything at all, really. To me, that shouldn't be their job. I don't care about their opinions.   The way I see it, the best broadcasters (Jack Buck, Vin Scully, Bob Eucker) don't have soapboxes. They're storytellers. They describe the game in front of them, and respect the listeners enough to let them come to their own conclusions. Their broadcasts are/were unobtrusive and inclusive, rather than lectures.   It's an art form. I don't think anyone thinks of Danny, Rick, Al, or Tim as an ""artist."" They talk down to the listener, and that's what gets under my skin."
Cardinals,3c4l7r,sgtshootsalot,3,Sat Jul 4 19:15:26 2015 UTC,"And they will never let a moment of silence speak for its self. If Dan is done talking, he just finds something to fill the space with. Compared to other broadcasting teams that will let the game speak for itself, this really erks me"
Cardinals,3c4l7r,t-poke,5,Sun Jul 5 03:39:18 2015 UTC,Yes. I would love to see Pang and JK do a game even just as a joke. They're two of the best in the NHL.   Maybe Dan and Al and Pang and JK could switch roles for April a Fools Day. But that would mean listening to Dan and Al do a Blues game which would probably be unbearable.
Cardinals,3c4l7r,carcrazy0214,3,Sat Jul 4 19:54:14 2015 UTC,Joe Buck called part a of a Blues game once.  I think he didn't do too bad of a job given that he didn't really know the Kings' players and that hockey is a lot faster paced than football or baseball.
Cardinals,3c4l7r,Gumby_Hitler,5,Sat Jul 4 22:57:11 2015 UTC,Dan is good when he's not fellating Mitch Harris. Al's curmudgeonly ways are irritating. Rick at least is enthusiastic.

Cardinals,3c4z68,dlnvf6,3,Sat Jul 4 21:00:21 2015 UTC,There is just no place for Jay. Bourjos and Pham bench guys. Grich CF and fill ins for holiday and Heyward.  We need pitching and 1st depth. Package Jay into that trade. Bourjos prolly being included in that talk too. He is not liked by Matheny.
Cardinals,3c4z68,meowmeowtits,4,Sun Jul 5 21:59:55 2015 UTC,"He is not liked by Matheny.   Just curious, what are you basing that on? I've only heard Matheny say good things about Bourjos. Or is it based on the fact that Matheny just rarely uses him? Either way, I think it's a shame because he's one of my favorite players and I'd love to see him play more regularly. Not gonna happen with our stacked OF, though."
Cardinals,3c4z68,MommaCatPat,3,Mon Jul 6 07:28:20 2015 UTC,It just seems he is given up on real quickly since joining team.  I mean if you would have said Jay and Holiday would both be on DL and Bourjos still is on bench I would have called you silly. It seems he needs to go 2-4 or 1-3 with a walk and double for him to get consecutive day starts. Short short leash.
Cardinals,3c4z68,meowmeowtits,2,Mon Jul 6 23:27:33 2015 UTC,Does anyone play 1st?
Cardinals,3c4z68,Woolly1806,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:22:07 2015 UTC,Jay has practiced at 1st. Wouldn't mind getting his noodle arm out of the outfield.

Cardinals,3c37id,SouthpawRage,3,Sat Jul 4 13:27:09 2015 UTC,I have an easy solution for you to avoid this problem in the future. Have bacon for breakfast every morning. you can make it in the oven or toaster oven. Save the grease and make delicious fried eggs with it!  Or you can do the Michael Scott and set out a George Forman grill next to you bed. Just don't step on it!
Cardinals,3c37id,ramstepside83,2,Sat Jul 4 13:57:06 2015 UTC,"I do have bacon most mornings, to be honest. At least on the weekends. Most of the time it's the microwaveable pre-cooked Oscar Meyer stuff, but that's still pretty decent.  My big mistake was that I forgot to put it on my grocery list yesterday. I was walking around Walmart, and I spotted it as I was on my way to get something else, and thought, ""oh, I gotta double back to get that!"" And completely forgot :("
Cardinals,3c37id,SouthpawRage,4,Sat Jul 4 14:45:53 2015 UTC,"Unsolicited tip from a former Schnucks Meat Master: the best bacon, by far, is the stuff the meat departments package up themselves. It is thicker and take a little bit longer to cook but it is well worth it."
Cardinals,3c37id,DlSCOSTU,4,Sat Jul 4 14:59:15 2015 UTC,"I would love to buy real bacon, it is definitely so much better... I just feel like I'd rarely use it all with just me and my boyfriend eating it. I know I could freeze it, but then I'd have to thaw it beforehand..."
Cardinals,3c37id,SouthpawRage,2,Sat Jul 4 15:14:33 2015 UTC,"He's right. We go to a meat market and bacon is $4.50-$5/lb. we were buying prepackaged for anywhere from $6-8/ lb and it was wimpy.  pre cook it ok Sunday and wallah! Pre-cooked bacon, cheaper than Oscar sells and much more delicious!"

Right now we're 1 for 33 with RISP which is of course pretty awful. BUT after reviewing some statistics and our past victories I think I have a crazy plan to get us back on track.   We need to start scoring more run than the other team LET ME FINISH because in all our past wins, the times we have scored more than the opposing club has positively correlated with our win percentage thereby leading me to the impression that if we have more runs on the board than the Padres at the end of 9 innings this afternoon...we have a pretty good chance at winning.

After a while you don't  really mind or notice that you are indoors (cough, cough Tropicana cough cough). Also they give out free scorecards and pencils, which doesn't affect my ranking, but is awesome nontheless.  I agree. Angel Stadium was nothing special. Nothing bad about it per se, but there just wasn't anything that made me say ""oh that's nice/cool/good"".   As far as I'm concerned it has better sightlines than dodger stadium, and a nicer concourse, so that puts it one small bit ahead in my book."

Cardinals,3c0a6a,Michael__Pemulis,3,Fri Jul 3 17:06:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! Actually not very much study on color theory. I've started to pick it up as I've gone along--I didn't start painting until January of last year after I took an art therapy class. (I'm working on my MA in professional counseling--interning as a substance abuse counselor now.) I drew in high school, but color is kind of new to me, really.   I've started reading more about it, though--there's a part of me that's afraid of overriding what comes natural with book-learnin'. What do you think?"
Cardinals,3c0a6a,Yodels,4,Fri Jul 3 17:18:56 2015 UTC,I think you'll be pretty darn good either way.
Cardinals,3c0a6a,Michael__Pemulis,3,Fri Jul 3 17:26:48 2015 UTC,Color theory is really different than most other 'art theory' type stuff. I think some would really help you.  This is where I would start. Albers is the man when it comes to color. I would highly suggest it just because of your style and it isn't overly dense or stuffy compared to reading someone like Wittgenstein.

Cardinals,3c1c4y,iamadacheat,3,Sat Jul 4 15:21:38 2015 UTC,VEB does a good job outlining some options here.
Cardinals,3c1c4y,penguinn,2,Fri Jul 3 22:09:06 2015 UTC,"I think you'd have to at least think about going after Lind, even as a rental. The Brewers already seem resigned to the idea of letting him go to another NL Central team, better us than the Pirates.   We have the war chest to keep him if he works out -- especially if we decide to part ways with Heyward -- but even if he is just a rental, that makes a lot of sense this year."
Cardinals,3c1c4y,Cards2WS,2,Fri Jul 3 22:12:33 2015 UTC,"Lind has gotta be the best option here. Shouldn't cost more than a B prospect, he's a lefty batter, he has power, and he's decently consistent. Doesn't have a glaring hole like Reynold's strikeout numbers...a platoon of Scruggs/Lind/Reynolds would be so damn good. A bench that consists of two of those 3 each night? Yes please.   A bench of: C-Cruz 2nd/SS-Garcia 1B-Scruggs 1B/3B/LF-Reynolds OF-Peter/Grichuk/Pham  That is a deep, versatile bench right there."
Cardinals,3c1c4y,Drew119,4,Fri Jul 3 23:46:33 2015 UTC,And then we have 4 relievers...
Cardinals,3c1c4y,AnonymousJobber,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:21:09 2015 UTC,"Only one of the Bourjos-Grichuk-Pham combo would be on the bench each night. So it's still a bench of five, which means seven bullpen arms. (Even if MM will only use four or five of those arms.)"
Cardinals,3c1c4y,Drew119,0,Sat Jul 4 19:17:37 2015 UTC,So Holliday and Jay are.....?
Cardinals,3c1c4y,AnonymousJobber,0,Sat Jul 4 19:33:42 2015 UTC,"Currently on the DL. And when they come back, Holliday returns to left, and Jay gets traded. So we'll have five OFs again.  (EDIT: The Jay trade will be Mozeliak's move to take away Matheny's option to continually put Jay in the lineup, much like what happened with Allen Craig last July.)"
Cardinals,3c1c4y,Thepancakeman1k,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:41:34 2015 UTC,no glaring holes?  like his batting average against left handed pitching?
Cardinals,3c1c4y,Cards2WS,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:12:00 2015 UTC,"My mistake, I thought it was being assumed he would be a platoon player with Scruggs taking the at bats vs southpaws. If he only faces righties, then yeah, no real glaring holes"
Cardinals,3c1c4y,thetasigma1355,2,Mon Jul 6 06:43:35 2015 UTC,"I realize it's a ""what if"" question, but unjust want to say I think we should be seeing Scruggs full time at this point. He's a young player who needs consistent AB's so that we can truly evaluate his big league potential. And it's not like he's sucked, so keep playing him."
Cardinals,3c1c4y,Ihateunerds,-1,Fri Jul 3 22:58:33 2015 UTC,"He's not young. He's a 27 year old career minor leaguer with an .822 career OPS.  He has absolutely no business playing first base for a good major league team.  He needs to be replaced by someone much better, not get more at bats."
Cardinals,3c1c4y,34679,2,Sat Jul 4 15:19:36 2015 UTC,"Paul Goldschmidt, and I don't care what it takes."
Cardinals,3c1c4y,jopjor,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:44:14 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this a lot in a short time. At first glance, I hated the idea of Lind as I think I sort of type-cast him. His BABIP suggests some regression, but several other advanced metrics have him pretty consistent on offense the last few years. For the sake of discussion, here's some other options I've considered:  Stephen Vogt, OAK — I like this kid a lot, but I think the A's do too. He's another guy who the eye test may not be kind to, but dig deeper in the numbers and there's plenty to like. Would Oakland be willing to deal one of their few young, bright stars? Well, when have they ruled out trading anyone? Would likely cost quite a bit, but I'm guessing he could be had.   Brandon Moss, CLE — Likely would come quite a bit cheaper than Vogt. Guy has obvious power but also his share of holes. If guys like Wong and Carpenter pick it up to the point you don't need to rely too heavily on him, Moss could be a nice fit.  Mitch Moreland, TEX — He has actually shown some flashes of being a pretty good power hitter. He's easily had his best season to date this year, which makes me nervous. But, projection systems like ZIPS and Steamer like him to stay close to his current numbers. I'm not sure I trust that, but he intrigues me.   Justin ""The Pirate"" Turner, LAD — Super utility guy off the Dodgers' bench. Has popped quite a few homers already this year. BABIP suggests he could regress if his luck turns, but he's actually maintained pretty consistent numbers throughout his career despite the good luck. A small number of SOs could be the explanation for that.   Anyway, it's a lot to chew on, but those are my thoughts on potential fits."
Cardinals,3c1c4y,Drew119,2,Sat Jul 4 04:27:25 2015 UTC,"If the cardinals go anywhere near that ginger bastard, I'll be the newest cubs fan."
Cardinals,3c1c4y,AnonymousJobber,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:22:39 2015 UTC,"Vogt is hardly ""young,"" (he's 30) and the A's could control him until the end of the 2019 season if they wanted to. Only major advantage to sell Vogt now is that this might very well be his peak value, offering the most to Billy Beane in return.  Moss makes a lot of sense. He's a free agent after 2016, and it'd be hard to imagine a (likely) retooling Indians club shelling out for a then-33 y.o. player like Moss. He'd be a left-handed bat and could platoon with Scruggs or Reynolds. Like with Vogt, this might be the time for Cleveland to maximize what they could get for Moss.  Of the options you presented, Moreland makes the most sense to me. He'd be relatively cheap, because he'd be a ten-week rental.  Turner is a valuable member of the Dodgers and I can't see him being made available."
Cardinals,3c1c4y,jopjor,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:26:44 2015 UTC,"Good catch on Vogt's age. He's only been in the majors a short time so I (foolishly) assumed he'd be in his mid-20s. Anyway, his career is young. I think that age could be something that leads the A's to deal him, though. Sure, he's controllable through 2019, but that'd take him into his mid-30s. I don't think there's much doubt there's a good chance his trade value is as high as it'll be right now. Makes him more likely to be available but harder to get, obviously.   I'm intrigued by Moreland, but I think I might rather have Moss or Lind before him. The Cardinals broke their skid today because C-Mart delivered another gem and the bullpen held, but that formula isn't sustainable for an entire season. Gotta find a way to score more runs."
Cardinals,3c1c4y,iamadacheat,-3,Sun Jul 5 00:28:17 2015 UTC,"I would like to see a trade for Joey Votto.  I think it would cost us a butt-load in terms of salary, and in prospects(I would imagine talks would only start once one of Reyes/Kaminsky/Gonzales is on the table), but I think this team has the chance to be an all time great team, and adding a player of his caliber might make this a once in a lifetime team('27, '98 Yankees; '01 Mariners).  Obviously adding another LHB to the order might make Matheny go insane, but I can live with that."
Cardinals,3c1c4y,DlSCOSTU,7,Fri Jul 3 21:33:42 2015 UTC,I love Joey Votto but I don't want that contract.  He's signed through 2023.

Cardinals,3c1c4y,meowmeowtits,2,Fri Jul 3 21:43:12 2015 UTC,The Reds would have to eat half his salary for me to want any part of that.
Cardinals,3c1c4y,sgtshootsalot,4,Fri Jul 3 23:14:35 2015 UTC,Signed till he's 40 at 25 million a year for the last 6 years of it.....hell no.
Cardinals,3c1c4y,meowmeowtits,-5,Fri Jul 3 23:33:37 2015 UTC,"My point here is why should we care?  Luxury tax aside, the DeWitts could probably sustain a roster of =/= $300 million dollars and still make a profit.  If he can help us this year and the next, why should we care if he doesn't produce over the remainder of his contract?  Plus his skill set is one that generally ages pretty well, and though his power is declining, he could easily become a high OBP player with lots of doubles, just like Holliday did this year."

The students held a ""sit in"" and called the media and a crazy bunch of stuff was said.

Cardinals,3bzhv4,GoSomaliPirates,6,Sat Jul 4 14:33:23 2015 UTC,As others have said. It appears to be less about the fact that she was fired and more about the way it was handled and the blatant lack of respect the admins seem to have for the mods.
Cardinals,3bzhv4,kuhanluke,6,Fri Jul 3 16:47:08 2015 UTC,God I fucking hope so. Just to make all the redditors look like dumbasses
Cardinals,3bzhv4,GoSomaliPirates,2,Fri Jul 3 13:44:41 2015 UTC,Except it wouldn't. Because the problem isn't that Victoria was fired; it's that the affected subs weren't warned and there's nothing in place to sustain the community. AMA doesn't work without Victoria and the default subs weren't made aware of it until someone's agent who was scheduled to do an AMA messaged the mod team and told them about it.
Cardinals,3bzhv4,kuhanluke,3,Fri Jul 3 21:02:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can see why that is a problem for iAmA, but why is everything else shutting down?   I don't come to reddit to ""fight the power"", I come to see funny content, keep up with my sports subs, and occasionally read news stories with misleading headlines. I think it is very childish that they have made Ellen Pao and Alexis Ohanian the most hated people on the site, while making it seem like Victoria was martyred.   I think the majority of the people posting are just in for a karma grab, and instead of not visiting the site, they just complain and post pictures of ellen pao and are essentially saying ""dae upvotes?"""
Cardinals,3bzhv4,GoSomaliPirates,3,Fri Jul 3 21:14:24 2015 UTC,Because it represents a disconnect between the admins and the unpaid volunteers who they expect to work their asses off to moderate the default subs (like our own /u/thelazt1). And a lot of subs have AMAs and a lot of those in subs like /r/books and /r/art and /r/science were also through Victoria. And the fact that nobody is there to take her place while there are still AMAs scheduled and nobody to take care of them is just poor planning and a disregard for the community.

The husband is working (he works 6am-6pm) so he'll be at work during the parade, and then sleeping for the fireworks.  I probably should wrangle together some friends, but trying to get everyone on the same page is like herding cats.  Nearly impossible.  Fun story. My brother had an Australian Shepherd that tried to herd my mom's barn cats. Seto was always very sad when they just sat down and stared at him. And then usually nuzzled him."
Cardinals,3bzhv4,bFallen,3,Fri Jul 3 18:20:00 2015 UTC,I wish there was video of that dog attempting to herd the cats.
Cardinals,3bzhv4,ashlicrowe,4,Fri Jul 3 20:13:32 2015 UTC,"So I just hiked a mile-high mountain, drank from a Moroccan ice cold spring (with purification tablets just in case), walked through potentially millions of dollars worth of weed farms, and met a handful of amazing and friendly rural Berbers living in the mountains as farmers and goat herders (of all ages too).  It was incredibly taxing but I think I've found the current best experience of my life.  And there's so many little details I could recount too.  Wow."
Cardinals,3bzhv4,iamadacheat,11,Fri Jul 3 20:58:44 2015 UTC,"I get solidarity all that, but I hate this type of Occupy Wall Street KONY 2012 bandwagon shit that reddit is doing right now. Holy slacktivism, Batman."
Cardinals,3bzhv4,ashlicrowe,5,Fri Jul 3 17:15:35 2015 UTC,"Well, making major subs private affects Reddit's advertising dollars.  Although not so much if people still spend their day on different subs.  Personally, I did re-enable Adblock because I don't think it's fair that they didn't warn any of the moderators whom this seriously affects."
Cardinals,3bzhv4,gapporin,4,Fri Jul 3 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's true.  It's just the ""well everybody else is doing it so we're doing it too"" that bothers me.  But again, I recognize solidarity."
Cardinals,3bzhv4,ashlicrowe,3,Fri Jul 3 17:44:47 2015 UTC,Never forget KONY.  Twitter became unbearable for me after the Gamergate debacle. And the worst part about any type of major Internet drama is that both sides become so loud and unrelentless that it just ends up being pure noise.

Cardinals,3bx1r3,flagamuffin,2,Fri Jul 3 02:53:58 2015 UTC,"Because in general, insanely talented hitters make terrible hitting coaches. Too much natural ability. Hitters who've had to work on their craft their whole careers are better at teaching the process."

Cardinals,3bv8eb,SouthpawRage,3,Thu Jul 2 13:53:22 2015 UTC,YUM. My coworker brings in quiche every once in a while. It'd be delicious if she didn't put a whole onion patch in it.  I'm currently waiting on my Special K flatbread bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwich to cool so I can stop starving to death. They're actually pretty good for a frozen/microwaved breakfast.
Cardinals,3bv8eb,F117Nighthawk,3,Thu Jul 2 14:02:04 2015 UTC,"That's A LOT of onion. Mine is mainly spinach and mushrooms with a little onion, garlic, and of course cheese.

Cardinals,3bv8eb,SouthpawRage,2,Thu Jul 2 14:04:23 2015 UTC,"She LOVES onion, so she piles it on to everything. Hers is usually just eggs, hashbrowns, onion, cheese, and sometimes some sausage. I guess it's really more of just a casserole, but it's close enough.  That's what I have them for, I keep them in the freezer at work in case I forget breakfast or don't have time before I leave. I don't usually get fancy with breakfast, oatmeal or scrambled eggs on the weekends."
Cardinals,3bv8eb,F117Nighthawk,3,Thu Jul 2 14:16:49 2015 UTC,I'm fancy with everything. I'm not just a brain! Why can't people love me for my cooking. It's tough being a woman.

Cardinals,3bv8eb,gotsnow,5,Thu Jul 2 17:01:43 2015 UTC,"So I've been thinking about the very first MLB game I ever attended, and that I have no memory of what date the game was. I knew these facts:   We were visiting my grandparents, otherwise Dad probably wouldn't have bought the tickets for the Cardinals game because we lived further away from St. Louis. The Cardinals were playing the Giants at Busch II, and it was an evening-night game. Mark McGwire was on the team, so this narrows it down to the 1998 & 1999 seasons - it was more probable that it was the 1998 season. I got up the next morning and saw in the Belleville News-Democrat that the Cardinals had lost.   So, using Baseball Reference, I've determined it was either the game on Sunday, May 24, or the game on Saturday, June 6.  The hilarious part is that both of those games went into extra innings, and I distinctly remembered that we left before the game had ended because Dad wanted to beat traffic -- However that probably puts us out of the ballpark before the 9th inning.  So, looking at play-by-play and my distinct recollection of watching McGwire head toward first base at least twice, I can only conclude it was the May 24th game, because I think I would have remembered 3 intentional walks and a hit by pitch on McGwire from the June 6th game. What I sadly don't remember, though, is the home run that McGwire apparently hit on May 24th, and I have no recollection of Barry Bonds hitting a home run either.  Then again, I was 8 years old."
Cardinals,3bv8eb,huanthewolfhound,3,Thu Jul 2 15:17:16 2015 UTC,Nice. My first ever game was during the 1996 NLCS at Qualcomm Stadium: Cardinals vs Padres. All I can remember is that the Cardinals won.
Cardinals,3bv8eb,bdjohns1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:34:04 2015 UTC,That would have been the NLDS. First one I have clear memories of is Game 4 of the 1996 NLCS vs. the Braves at Busch II.

Cardinals,3bv8eb,ashlicrowe,3,Thu Jul 2 18:07:24 2015 UTC,"That's the thing for me too: I saw McGwire, and that's all I really needed to remember."
Cardinals,3bv8eb,gotsnow,3,Thu Jul 2 18:23:35 2015 UTC,"Cool.  I decided to try the same thing.  In my case:   1986 (before my 7th birthday) Against the Expos I think it was a weeknight, which means it was after school was out Cardinals lost   Best guess was June 10th, because I don't remember it going into extras, and I think we left a little early because my dad had to work in the morning.  I also remember that we sat above the right field scoreboard, back when they still sold seats in the outfield upper deck."

Being at the game and then listening to the last inning on the way home (yea, i left before the very end. Sacrelige), i felt an odd yet comforting connection to my grandpa and surely my dad before me, listening out a futile effort with all the hope i had channelled into KMOX, hoping for miracle, but pulling into the driveway as we swung our last strike. Blah blah blah baseball romanticism, but it was a nice moment and salvaged the loss for me. There ya go."

Cardinals,3budeq,kuhanluke,2,Thu Jul 2 08:57:45 2015 UTC,"Pessimism for a team that's 1 game under .667 is just whining.   Honestly, my only problem with today's game was Reynolds hitting fourth (and Reynolds starting in general is a problem.) Otherwise, Carpenter is slumping and Maness and Choate had shit nights, but yesterday, we struck out a bunch to the best strikeout pitcher in the league and Quintana ain't bad either."
Cardinals,3budeq,bdmflyer,5,Thu Jul 2 09:12:09 2015 UTC,"Last year's Brewers were 18 games over 500 on July 1st.  Last year's A's were 20 games over 500 on July 1st.  One of those teams ended the season 8 games back, and the other was relegated to a Wild Card game that they lost.  I'm not saying the house is on fire, or even smoking, but the record doesn't mean much."
Cardinals,3budeq,flagamuffin,2,Thu Jul 2 13:33:32 2015 UTC,our runs per game dropped by almost one in the 2013 playoffs and hasn't come back but i guess i'm not allowed to mention that either  someday our pitching won't carry us. bullpen is already starting to regress to normal levels
Cardinals,3budeq,kuhanluke,2,Thu Jul 2 17:47:00 2015 UTC,"On the downside, a tough loss and a long rain delay.   On the plus side, the seats were killer and I got a new T-shirt."

Cardinals,3budeq,Katiroth,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:39:31 2015 UTC,I have a story about why this game was so important to me. But I don't want to type it on mobile and won't be home for another two and a half hours. Stupid long drive.  I'll share it in tomorrow's unofficial thread.   So right now I'm just sitting at a shitty Denny's and trying to stay awake. Massive amounts of gas station coffee will soon be drunk.
Cardinals,3budeq,Sheathe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:47:09 2015 UTC,The worst part of these late night losses is having to hear the other team's commentary when I watch the game recap in the morning...
Cardinals,3budeq,mehx1000,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:49:40 2015 UTC,This team has a serious flaw in that we suck against left hand pitching.  This could be a problem in the playoffs.
