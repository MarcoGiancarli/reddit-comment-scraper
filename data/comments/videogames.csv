And that's what started my hobbie for collecting video games....also I saw a bunch of YouTube videos of people finding retro games at yard sales and I thought why not give it a shot see what I can find and now here we are 2 years later I've been able to get almost all my childhood games back and build up a game room filled with awesome retro and new games and I couldn't be happier :)"

videogames,3d5d5v,Edward-R-S,4,Mon Jul 13 17:32:01 2015 UTC,I too would occasionally Google Shenmue 3 to see if any new rumors or hard news was out there. Then this year I decided to watch the Sony E3 presentation and went absolutely bonkers when the music started playing and Shenmue 3 was announced! I've been looking forward to this game for many many years and am so happy to be a part of its creation.
videogames,3d5d5v,aldo524,0,Mon Jul 13 17:53:50 2015 UTC,"The past few E3s had been a bit lackluster so I didn't even watch this year. This years E3 has been more exciting than any I've seen in the past! There are so many great games coming out, MGS5, Shenmue 3, Fallout 4, Uncharted 4, No Man's Sky and Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Final Fantasy 7 remake. Sony killed it!"
videogames,3d5d5v,vspectra,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:18 2015 UTC,"Basically, most of the game development funding will be from Kickstarter. Sony is helping with marketing and porting the game to their platform, which allows Suzuki to use the majority of the funds from KS to actually creating Shenmue 3.  $5 million goal, which we are very in close reach of, will allow Suzuki to create a Shenmue with ideas he's been dreaming of implementing for 14 years, these include the character perspective system (play as different characters and see their viewpoint of the situation) and rapport system (personality system for the Shenhua heroine who will change her feelings, remarks, interactions towards you depending on what you say and do with her on the quest). Hitting $7.5 million will allow for a greater expansion of the combat system, allowing it to be much more advanced than even in Shenmue 2 - fyi the combat plays a lot like Virtua Fighter. $10-11 million gives a much greater expansion of villages with mini games/side jobs that Shenmue is known for, and allows for the Magic Maze (procedural generation of the Guilin Forrest area with many more events to unfold).  If we can even only reach $7.5 million for the upgraded battle system, I think that's the stretch goal a lot of the fans would be really happy if we can hit it. It'll only happen if we can all still get support for Shenmue and hopefully attract newcomers to this series.  No pressure on anyone who doesn't want to help fund the game for their own reasons, and if you don't like Shenmue, that's cool too. Just hoping this info clears up some misconceptions about the Sony Shenmue situation with people thinking Sony is actually funding a lot of money, but they aren't. Shenmue is a great series that's had a lot of influence on modern open world game design, and many fans have been waiting for 14 years for this sequel to finally happen and they're trying to make it the best it can be. Right now we're about $2.5 million away from achieving all of the combat system upgrade stretch goals.  Thanks for any support! :)"

videogames,3d5d5v,evilr2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:00:06 2015 UTC,"I am not sure if you are a fan of the original two games but just in case you aren't I'll fill you in. Shenmue is an epic 11 chapter story told over multiple games. It may take a total of 4 games to tell the whole tale (possibly more).   The 2nd game ended on a cliffhanger and fans have been waited for over a decade to see where the story goes next. The kickstarter got all the money it needed when it reached $2 million. That would give fans a bare bones game that would move the plot along.  However, the beauty of Shenmue lies not in the story alone but in the depth of the game world. There were so many addicting mini-games to play and random side quests that allowed you to deviate from the main story line and that is what took it from a pretty good game to a classic masterpiece.   I don't want Yu Suzuki to just make a game (although I'd settle for that) but rather something that has everything he WANTS to make a memorable title. It is because the story will not end with Shenmue 3 that the game needs to sell, be well received and get us to Shenmue 4 and possibly beyond."
videogames,3d5d5v,Awol,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:55:43 2015 UTC,"For so long I was wanting and waiting for it to happen. As time has gone by I've lost interest in it. I looked at the Kickstarter page and I saw that if I do put money in, it'll still be another two years before its released. I'm just not sure what I'll be doing in two years as I'll probably be even less interested. If they can guarantee that the story will finally end then I'll consider it.  It would be a total bummer if they just left us hanging for another 10 years after its released before they release the next installment."

Everyone and their dog on /r/videogames has heard of Smash Bros and knows whether the newest incremental improvement is for them or not. It's not the kind of game you need to review. At all. Especially not this long after it was released.  Instead, why not try to find something new to say about it? Don't just throw another ""here's what I like and here's what I don't like"" video onto the heap.  Or take a completely different approach, and make a video like this about a game that actually needs a review; something that people probably haven't heard of or is receiving mixed reviews."

This video would simply be so much better if it had something else to it! Like, a fight in the beginning that sets up the story or something. Why didn't he just do that?!

videogames,3c5p9z,bonewhitefox,2,Sun Jul 5 01:36:09 2015 UTC,"I think the draw of RPG gameplay , for me anyway, is that feeling of leveling up or getting more loot. I never find myself bored as I'm wandering through the over world because I am thinking about my stats, what I can improve, what I can change, where I can get items to craft better gear, and when I'm going to level up. The feeling of leveling up or finding better items never ends, because it's really the core game.   But aside from gameplay I love story. I have always been a suckered for a good story and plot is the main selling point for games for me typically. RPGs in my experience have some of the best character driven stories, and you can affect them a lot with the choices you make.   So I believe that answers both your questions. They are fun because they tell a good story and keep you thinking during the story. You will probably be used to them being often low action for the same reasons: the loot, stats and story will keep you occupied and entertained. Unless it doesn't. Maybe RPGs won't be your thing, that's totally fine and you can only figure that out by playing.   Edit: Oh, how rude of me. Welcome to the hobby! Bioshock is an excellent first choice."
