They've got to be medpacks of some kind.  Makes me think that the health drops by demons are supposed to supplement, but not replace, finding health in levels."
Doom,3e4aen,xblood_raven,4,Tue Jul 21 21:11:12 2015 UTC,I noticed something else as well after that part. When the Hell Knight charges and slams it's fists into the ground; it ends up hitting the Revenant which causes the Revenant to stumble back (visually indicating it's hurt).   The Revenant then proceeds to turn and attack the Hell Knight but the camera turns away from this part but it's still a small look at enemy infighting.

Doom,3e2kl1,Marnetmar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:46:02 2015 UTC,Doubtful. This isn't the same id and in this case for the better.

Doom,3e354x,ChrisOfAllTrades,3,Tue Jul 21 16:43:09 2015 UTC,"0-20 fps is unplayable. 20-30fps is painful. 30-40fps is tolerable. 40-60fps is comfortably smooth. 60fps+ is negligibly noticeable, but I haven't actually played for any extensive periods of time (much less anything actually twitchy) on a 120hz monitor.  Of course, I doubt even 5% of gamers have rigs and setups that would allow over 60fps anyway, and I think, this being an ID game, we're going to be looking at a hard coded FPS cap in DOOM, especially if they want multiplayer (PvP) play to be a big part of the experience.  Seriously though, if experiencing 120fps and going back to 60fps is going from smooth to choppy, I don't want to experience 120fps for longer than a few brief demo moments window shopping at the electronics store.  The need to keep my rig THAT topped off would murder my wallet."

Doom,3e1lhm,Indoctrinator,4,Tue Jul 21 06:45:16 2015 UTC,"Doom and Doom 2 have some of the most unique and recognizable sounds of any video game. From the sounds of the doors, to the demon's screams of death, Doom's sound FX were brilliant.    What's interesting is that this is mostly because of the cultural significance and familiarity of Doom. Most of the sounds are actually pretty generic stock sounds from audio libraries, with a little tweaking. Well-selected and used sounds, but stock nonetheless.  I still agree, though. So much of what makes Doom fun is the now-iconic sounds. I'd like to see new, high-quality, unified audio design that directly harkens back and homages the originals.    If you want remastered sounds, you can get those now! There's a high-res Doom audio pack where the author tracked down most of the high-quality original sound library samples and rebuilt the Doom sounds. It's absolutely amazing to play with."

The standard shotguns come in a very close second, partly because of the oomph, partly because, to borrow from another user's words, ""the pellets don't turn into marshmellows propelled by cotton candy after twenty feet,"" and I'll add it that the spread of the pump action shotgun is that of a pump action shotgun, not a shotgun with a two-inch long barrel and the effective killing range of DOOM guy's arm.  Beyond that point, most FPS shotguns don't hit anything.  Forget damage fall off.  God I hated it so much when the shotgun in Halo 2 and onwards fell into this trope of useless shotguns.  Halo 1's performed as excellently as DOOM's shotgun.  After that, FPS 101, as in, completely effing useless outside of melee range."

Doom,3ds9bo,captaincrunchey,3,Sun Jul 19 11:33:57 2015 UTC,"/u/waffeli has the technical part down. Just so you know though, there's a distinction between a wad and what's called a megawad. A wad is either one level or a small pack of them. Megawads are large packs of levels that are near or at the size of a commercially released Doom game like Doom 2 or Final Doom.  Now for some I'd recommend:  Megawads for Doom 1  Doom the Way id Did (aka. DTWID): It's a fun, well-built wad based off of the level design style of the original Doom. Its levels are noticeably more detailed than the classic ones, though.  ConC.E.R.Ned: A personal favorite. It's a challenging and fast-paced wad with lots of baddies and secrets. It's already throwing swarms of cacodemons at you early in the first episode.  Megawads for Doom 2  No Rest for the Living: It's not strictly a megawad, but it's an episode-length campaign of some of the most intense, well-built, exciting and detailed Doom 2 levels out there. Albeit that's because it was designed by professionals to pack in with Doom 2 on Xbox Live as well as the Doom 3 BFG edition. All the same, it's a must play. I loved every moment of it.  Requiem: Another pretty detailed and challenging wad. Lots of enemies, lots of tight corridors where your super shotgun will come in handy. It's tough but it's a ride.  Memento Mori: This wad is geared more towards co-op, but it's perfectly playable and just as fun on your own. Detailed maps and lots of well-differentiated monsters; you're rarely fighting big mobs of the same type.  Whispers of Satan: Incredibly dense and long levels with a spectacular amount of stuff going on in them. A great challenge; secrets are creatively hidden and fun to find."

Doom,3ds9bo,ANON122342124124,2,Sun Jul 19 08:08:41 2015 UTC,"I use a little loader called ZDL.  Through it, I can choose which sourceport and the wads I want to run on it.  Y'see, while clicking and dragging works, it only lets you go so far as to click and drag ONE item and starting the game.  Now, you could enter a command string into the properties of the executable, but it's a PITA compared to using ZDL, adding in the wads you want to play, and it just loads them all at once.  DOOM:One + DOOM:One music (that newly added E1M1 guitar riff.... MMM!) Project Brutality + DOOMNukem_Visor hud?  No problem!"

So I'd say don't expect anything complex. I'm betting narrative stuff and flavor text will be in between the levels, but the levels themselves will be 100% about killing shit.  Plus I think it's telling that the promotional videos for Doom 3 were mostly exposition and moody horror stuff about science gone wrong, whereas Doom 4's thus far has been the equivalent of dumping a bucket of blood on your head and then violently shaking you whilst screaming."

Doom,3dn1ld,MBMM1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:13:06 2015 UTC,"3 is a different kind of DOOM.  The only similarities it really shares with DOOM are that it's based on Mars and that hell is invading.  Beyond that, DOOM and DOOM II are about beating the armies of Hell back to where they came from.    DOOM III by contrast is more a horror shooter.  Less about the shooting, more about the atmosphere.  Some people just didn't like it.  I'm not big on horror games myself (Dead Space is tantalizing... but no,) but I made an exception for DOOM III because it didn't come with the caveat of making my character completely hopeless in a fight like most horror games.  Also, it had DOOM on the title - made it worth a try.  It wasn't ""DOOM"" but it had its own charms in my opinion.  The BFG edition leans more towards the shooty side (mostly because NOW PCs can handle those graphics easily,) but it's still no DOOM/II."

It would probably be 100% regardless of whether it is done from pistol starts or continuous.

Doom,3dk06q,keyosc,7,Thu Jul 16 22:00:20 2015 UTC,"Great post, but I have to disagree with your conclusions about the Doom 3 logo. Given the themes of the original logos, I think it fits in rather well. You have the technological designs above in both, but where the original had the stone pyramids to symbolize the rising evil, Doom 3 was more subtle. Note the bright glow at the bottom of the logo. With the man-made technology above, the glow is below, like a rising fire coming to destroy what man has made. That the glow from this fire is so bright, in my opinion, symbolizes just how close this destruction is. Alternately, you could imagine yourself looking down at the Doom 3 logo as if it were a floor, and the harsh light is coming from an opened door. What door is opened, and what can come through it that warrants a title like ""Doom""?  I'd argue that the doom is just as impending in this logo as it is with the others."

Doom,3dk06q,capta1n_tr1ps,3,Fri Jul 17 01:19:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced you're reading too much into the logo. Artists, especially those that take as much care into their designs as is present in the original Doom logo, don't typically create by accident. The pyramids and hieroglyph-esque texture are unmistakable because they supplement each other, creating context that clearly identifies them as such. I'm having a hard time thinking that the artist who painted that logo was like ""I put some tech shit on top, then some gold shit on the bottom, and I think it looks pretty cool."" Anyway, good observations. Upvoted."

Doom,3dk06q,fRl1jOE_,2,Fri Jul 17 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"The reason that the new logo's colors are more ""bland"" is so that it can work well on all promotional material. The Doom I & III logo only works with the proper color template. They can't just slap the Doom I & III logo on anything and expect it to look good, the color template has to match. Since the new logo is a neutral color, they can do precisely just that.  It's a common marketing technique that most brands have moved too these days."
Doom,3dk06q,argv_minus_one,2,Fri Jul 17 11:53:05 2015 UTC,"A logo is not supposed to be a self-contained piece of art, it's supposed to be simple and easily recognizable. That is much better done with shape than it is with details within it.  Do you recognize the Apple logo? Yes. Do they always use different colors with it? Yes, there's been black, white, and gray Apple logos, and even the rainbow one from a while back. They work because a logo is based on shape to be recognizable, and therefore it's not defined by whatever color the shape actually is. It makes it much more versatile.   Is the new Doom logo a better piece of art? Most people would say no. But is it a better logo? Yes."

For editing, you only need one game.  As for an editor, that's a little more subjective, but Doomworld.com can probably point the way for you."
Doom,3divqs,dpkonofa,4,Thu Jul 16 18:00:12 2015 UTC,"The practical differences between DOOM and DOOM II are mostly textures for the environment and enemy availability.  For example, DOOM has the pink Baron's of Hell, while DOOM II has their lesser sibling, the Hell Knight.  DOOM II also has the now iconic Revenant, where as DOOM does not.  Mostly, DOOM II introduces some more ""heavy"" demons, but the common cannon fodder is amply present in both games.  Now, for making maps, I use DOOMbuilder 2.  As for building maps themselves, playing DOOM (and I would also recommend Heretic) over and over and over with an eye for level design details helps.  You'll notice levels only follow a very vague resemblance to locations they're named after.  Like the E1M3 Toxin Refinery?  It has four whole pools of green death, but two of those pools look sort of like they're in a processing chamber if you apply liberal use of your imagination.    I'd say the mistake most level designers make starting out is trying to make something more down-to-Earth instead of focusing on being more abstract.  My other personal tips (besides exploring the levels of DOOM thoroughly) include:  Foreshadow design:  I like to show players their eventual destinations as they march through the map, sort of having them loop into themselves.  You'll notice DOOM doesn't necessarily do this, it follows a more linear room-to-room level design with side paths for hidden goodies.  Looping levels can still be linear, it's just nice to approach a familiar location from a new, previously unobtainable angle.  Monster lay out.  This one's tricky.  Monsters have a tendency to shoot each other if you pack them into a tight corridor.  Somehow, they manage this even without having line of sight on you.  DOOM cleverly places enemies in such a way that it minimizes friendly fire, at least initially.  Be ready to delete everything and start over on occasion, because sometimes a level just doesn't have that feel.  I ended up deleting my first level half a dozen times before creating something I felt was appropriate for a level 1.  I'll probably go back to it after 8 or so levels and see how it checks out against my more refined skill set.  There was a Romero interview (level designer for DOOM) where the middle levels were his ""crap"" levels and the last levels he designed were the first levels we play.  Basically, I'm, suggesting build how you want, but go back over older work and determine if it needs an overhaul before publishing.  Test.  Test.  Test.  It seems obvious, but I tend to find the most problems with my maps through in game testing.  Even things like missing textures pop out more glaringly than when building the maps.  One last thing that may be easily overlooked: damage floors (typically represented via green slime, lava, blood, but can be ANY floor) are in themselves ""walls"" without being an actual physical barrier.  No one's going to willingly step onto deadly ground without good reason."

Doom,3divqs,D-Alembert,2,Sat Jul 18 18:50:32 2015 UTC,"With map making, it'll initially seem complex and daunting to get something up and running, but pretty soon it'l be simple and second-nature. Very quickly, the thing that deserves the bulk of your attention will be the design of your level (layout, gameplay, architecture, mood, pacing, etc) rather than the technical process of creating it. You'll be refining your design chops long after you've mastered using the editor, which is good because design is more fun than learning how to use software :D  You'll find a lot of quides online that can help with rules of thumb that get you thinking. (eg, a typical rule of thumb is that there should never be any area in the level that a player can end up trapped and unable to get out of (including lava/slime pits). Having to fight your way out is ok - the way out can be difficult, but it needs to be clear. On very rare occasions this rule will be broken to create a trap with certain death and no escape, but even then it risks being a bad trap - frustrating the player and feeling ""unfair"" rather than being exciting or suspenseful.)"
Doom,3divqs,caligari87,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"You only really need programming knowledge if you're planning on doing scripting with more modern engines like ZDoom. Just making maps is as simple as drawing some lines and putting in some numbers.  The best editor currently available (in my opinion) is GZDoomBuilder. It can build maps for almost everything from vanilla Doom all the way up to the latest GZDoom with just some config changes. With Ultimate Doom, there'll be a little difference in texture sets and fewer available enemies than Doom 2, but it's still more than enough for your first maps. Virtually everything else engine-side is identical, so there won't be hardly any learning curve between the two."

Doom,3dduls,lollers_,7,Wed Jul 15 14:27:41 2015 UTC,Few people seem to remember that Quake had the exact same system but with human enemies dropping backpacks. I would be alright if the system gets curbed so that dead enemies do not just drop loads of health and ammo but actually drop something that they should be carrying. Why would a cacodemon have shotgun shells?
Doom,3dduls,Volkov07,9,Wed Jul 15 18:05:33 2015 UTC,Maybe he ate a marine?
Doom,3dduls,Captain_Kuhl,4,Wed Jul 15 18:52:21 2015 UTC,"Doom also has drops. Machine gunners in Doom 2 dropped machine gun ammo for example, shotgun guys dropped shotguns. So it has been there from the beginning.  But as you said, enemies of a certain type only drops ammo for their own weapon, and the amount you get is so abysmal that it only postpones your demise if you are generally low on ammo and playing a level with few pickups.  For example, Chaingunners drops 10 ammo on the normal skill level and 20 on the easiest skill level and Nightmare. 10 bullets lasts maybe a second of firing. Barely enough to kill a lost soul and too little to kill a pinky/spectre.  So it's not pickups per se which is troublesome. It's more a problem if drops become super-common and you never run out of ammo, or if drops replaces items in the level. Like others here have said, hopefully the pinata drops in the E3 demo was just a temporary hack."
Doom,3dduls,Madsy9,2,Thu Jul 16 03:37:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the thing is, look what ammo you can loot from enemies:  Shotgun shells and bullets. The two most basic types of ammo.  In the new DOOM the ammo pickups seem to be global, probably problematic since having some types of ammo being more rare is a big deal"
Doom,3dduls,pereza0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:28:24 2015 UTC,You can just make the drop rate lower for rare ammo. It's not rocket science.
Doom,3dduls,Lava_Croft,3,Thu Jul 16 10:58:41 2015 UTC,"Except when you're deciding the drop rate for rocket launcher ammo, then it is rocket science."
Doom,3dduls,NoelBuddy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:49:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%. I miss the shooters which made you ration your ammo and even the health pickups that you would come across. Most of today's mainstream games drop challenge altogether and instead rely on short, linear, and non-lasting single player experiences. My favorite shooter of 2014, Wolfenstein, recreated the old school feeling of old beautifully. Let's hope that Id learnt a lesson from Machinegames."
Doom,3dduls,Volkov07,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:48:40 2015 UTC,Yeah but if the normal map pickups are replaced with enemy dropping pickups that's more than reasonable.  I do hope you can either switch between them or that this changes between some of the levels.

We literally know nothing of the menutia of the game.  Wait until you have confirmation  B) That is not COD style of games (which IMHO are a worst system )  This is more akin to borderlands with loot popping out.

Doom,3dduls,derfherdez,11,Thu Jul 16 01:37:38 2015 UTC,"I'm apprehensive about that staying in the game in that fashion. There were weapons and ammo pickups in the environment already. I believe the fountain of drops seen in the sizzler was to keep the game play demonstration moving smoothly, rather than having to worry about ammo conservation and holding back due to low health.   There'll be more info and game play released at QuakeCon so be patient and let's hope for the best."
Doom,3dduls,S1GMA,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:09:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's more because the levels are small and narrow, but have tons of spawning enemies in them, so it's either they line every tiny area with tons of ammo to make sure the player has enough to go against the hordes of monsters, or they make ammo and health dropped pickups."
Doom,3dduls,Turok1134,4,Wed Jul 15 18:56:10 2015 UTC,"I think the frequency of the drops has been greatly exaggerated in the demo. Chances are on higher difficulties it's just a small boost to keep you going in between finding medpacks if you're in the middle of a particularly brutal fight- we've already seen a soulsphere, armor pickups, and ammo boxes lying around, so I doubt that system is truly dead. This new system looks like it's trying to reward you for killing enemies as opposed to just dodging past and avoiding them.  Besides, who knows? Maybe there's a ""Classic Mode"" that turns that off. And I've said this before, but Doom 4 doesn't need to be Doom 2. We already have Doom 2 and a virtual infinity of mods and maps. If id wants to add in a few new ideas while still keeping it Doomy, be my guest."

But yeah, I can see why that could be a problem, given the new game's supposed adherence to classic Doom.  My guess is that ID thought that it would make designing maps by fans easier because they don't have to worry about health and ammo placement.  But now that you mention it it would be nice to have that option."
Doom,3dduls,iownannes,5,Wed Jul 15 16:06:51 2015 UTC,"I think it is ok if they just give basic ammo (rifle and basic shotty), but making it give ammo for all weapons can be problematic. You can limit the max ammo of each, but it is not enough - you have to ""equalize"" the power levels of all weapons like Shadow Warrior and especially Hard Reset did, which is awful. It also adds the problem that secrets are no longer such a big deal.  I am praying there will be pickups and that changing difficulty can change how much stuff demons drop.  It can still be a good game even if the ammo management is gone, but it was a fun aspect of the originals.  Also wanted to add that I really dislike OPs tone even if we are kind of in the same page. Saying ""fuck you"" because someone disagrees with you or making the stupid and beaten to death CoD analogy makes me want to rip and tear  Also, the souls series also had a big thing which was making healing make you vulnerable. I dont know any FPS that has done it but DOOM could do it through the fatality system, assuming you can take damage while performing them"
Doom,3dduls,pereza0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:12:40 2015 UTC,What's hard about setting different drop rates for different types of ammo?
Doom,3dduls,Lava_Croft,2,Thu Jul 16 11:00:10 2015 UTC,"It would help. But from what I have seen the game seems to be using an universal ammo system which doesn't mix well with drop rates. A universal ammo system would always give a bit of something, with a universal ammo system nothing is truly rare.  I mean, in DOOM1 the game has a lot of control over the amounts of ammo its giving you. In a game with weighted rates you will have a bit of everything most of the time. I think its definitely better than the universal system, but I still like it less than the classic. In the classic system finding ammo (and weapons) through secrets or after a fight is always a big deal. If you pistol start levels in DOOM1/2 you will notice it over and over.  A drop rate or universal system makes the pacing more uniform, so to say (Hard Reset, Shadow Warrior). Placed pickups can make it vary wildly (DOOM1/2, Serious Sam)"
Doom,3dduls,pereza0,3,Thu Jul 16 11:54:36 2015 UTC,"it would make designing maps by fans easier because they don't have to worry about health and ammo placement.   Is this even a goal worth aiming for? If I'm playing alternet maps generally the difference between a well put together map and a pile of crap frag-fest is how thoughtfully the weapons, health, and power ups are placed."
Doom,3dduls,NoelBuddy,3,Wed Jul 15 16:16:12 2015 UTC,"It seems like they copied that straight out of Brutal Doom. In BD, fatalities reward you with armor bonuses, and destroying props such as the hanging and impaled corpses sometimes drop armor bonuses and health vials."

Doom,3dduls,m4lmaster,3,Wed Jul 15 22:01:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's meant to keep the game fast paced and the player moving forward. Rather than slaughter a bunch of enemies and then stop to scrounge, or, god forbid, backtrack, for health, armor and ammo, the player is rewarded for keeping up a constant stream of kills.   It also maintains a flow from encounter to set piece to puzzle to battle. Keep the player moving. One of my few complaints with the original Dooms is how maze-like many levels were. Retreating to find a medikit you left behind could easily get you lost, and suddenly you've blown your par time, or have to wander around hallways you've already been through.   I think too that the enemies dropping items can make each encounter a little more strategic. If you come across a group of enemies and have 35 health, no armor, and 10 shells, killing them quickly and violently should bring you up to 40 or 45 health, 10 maybe 15 armor and 20 bullets. Even if you took a couple of hits. It sets up a Risk vs Reward that would drive the player to kill the next group faster or nastier than the last, if only so that they might be able to survive the next encounter."
Doom,3dduls,PowerSkunk92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:05:10 2015 UTC,"I liked the maze aspect, especially when the had monsters down an easy to miss side path or door with a trick opening trigger so when you backtrack you still have potential nasty new surprises waiting for you without having to resort to Doom 3's teleport the monsters in fuckery. The one imp popping out at you in a hallway you thought you cleared while you're backpedaling for health and ammo is 10 times as deadly as the one waiting predictably around the corner up ahead."
Doom,3dduls,NoelBuddy,2,Fri Jul 17 17:02:20 2015 UTC,"In principle, it works. Visually, it looks ridiculous. The enemies look like their innards are glowing pieces of lego. An easy way to fix this is by making them start glowing a second or two after hitting the ground."

Controlling Doom with the awkward N64 controller can be very problematic and awkward for many, and trading it for the familiarity of mouse+keyboard improves Doom 64 by quite a bit.    Loved the maps, the graphics, and the sound effects, but the ""atmospheric"" music of this game and Doom: Custom Playstation Edition (and others that used the same or similar soundtrack) never connected with me -- the soundtrack sounds more like it's meant for a very slow, survival horror-type game instead of the fast-paced, shoot-everything-that-moves Doom series (and that includes Doom 64, but not 3).  There's a lot of love for these types of soundtracks over the rock/metal-influenced original, but I'm of the mind that the rock/metal-influenced soundtracks fits the fast-paced, shoot-everything-that-moves type of game much better than the atmospheric ones.  It's a great game, but best when played outside of the confines of its original platform, and if you like the sort of soundtrack it comes with.  I've gone through it several times, and it's quite satisfying."

Doom,3daphc,angelsdontburn,3,Tue Jul 14 21:30:21 2015 UTC,"I had this game on N64 and boy oh boy do I regret trading this game because I was stuck on some level. Level 1 is so nostalgic, you start off alone music and atmosphere is dark. I remember playing it the first time and being scared of what was going to happend next. I played Doom shareware and Doom 2 before-hand but this was something else. Still to this day trying to find a cheap copy to get for my n64."
Doom,3daphc,sedkiller,3,Tue Jul 14 21:02:15 2015 UTC,I'm probably going to get flak for this but I'll say it anyways. Doom 64 I thought was great and all but I never understood the praise for the graphics or music. The monster sprites half the time looked even goofier than the original Doom and I will never get the appeal of the music. I gave it a chance but after about ten levels I just turned it off and played Doom 2 tracks and found myself enjoying the game much more than before. I wasn't scared or given a horror feel of any kind. I was just thinking who thought making random scratches and growls counted as background music. I practically had to force myself to finish Doom 64 before I put on Doom 2 tracks.
Doom,3daphc,General_101,2,Tue Jul 14 23:42:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, I prefer the original soundtrack. I especially hated the track with the looping crying babies. Annoyed the shit out of me"
Doom,3daphc,Bi0Hazard64,2,Wed Jul 15 06:18:04 2015 UTC,"I do find a lot of the enemies to be a little goofy too, and I can't quite put my finger on what it is overall. Some of the heavier redesigns, like the mancubus or cacodemon were a bit silly, but the goofy feel still goes with things like the baron/knight and cyberdemon, even though they haven't changed so much. Maybe it's the resolution on the sprites, but there's something off about them.  Though I did love the redesigns for the pinky and pain elemental. I'm not going to say I think they're completely better, but I do like them.  I honestly don't remember any of the music from Doom 64, though. It just didn't jump out at me the way the Doom and Doom 2 soundtracks did.  Really though, even though I actually do like Doom 64, there is one problem that overshadows the weird monsters: The double barreled shotgun has no reload animation. What then, I must ask, is the point? It's like drinking grape soda that isn't purple."
Doom,3daphc,Gryregaest,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:56:09 2015 UTC,They must have removed the reload animation for space saving sake but the double barrel just doesn't feel as satisfying because of it. Come to think of it most of the weapons were boring because of this exact reason. Very few frames compared to their Doom 1/2 counterpart.  Edit: And I would just like to say that I thought it was a great game leaving what I complained about out of the picture. I just feel like the Nintendo 64 really ruined the potential for this game to look great and they just released it there because it was the next big thing. If you look at the actual 3D models for the enemies they look fantastic as seen on Twitter.
Doom,3daphc,General_101,2,Thu Jul 16 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"Albeit developed by Midway, I always remember people saying that it's the ""true"" DooM 3. While I didn't play that much back in the day, I have recently downloaded the PC rip (with improvements from GZdoom) and have yet to try it, but either way, I still remember enjoying it thoroughly. The ONLY thing that bugged me were that the demons didn't have the same sound effects. I should probably boot up that PC rip right about now..."

Doom,3db9vl,iownannes,2,Wed Jul 15 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"It's based on chocolate-doom, but then doubles the game's native resolution; uncaps the framerate; it adds optional mouse look, jumping and weapon recoil; a re-designed compact/semi-transparent HUD; colours monster blood appropriately (probably taken from doometro); occasionally mirrors the death animation and corpses of monsters for variety (from doomretro); re-implements the random pitch shifting of sound effects from doom 1.2. That's off the top of my head, it would be worth looking at the release notes."

Your best bet is either idclip, or using a compatibility option for the old stair-building method, which is present in most modern ports I believe. ZDoom-based ports probably do not have this issue at all."

It looks like a badly designed early 90's WAD you find on these non official cd's with 500+ new DOOM AND QUAKE LEVELS!!!  Mostly a flat level with 90° corners. Narrow corridors. Wrong usage of some textures (green slime does no damage,  green slime on incremental heights like stairs)     Many teleporters to small rooms with a single or multiple switches. 4-5 switches in a row...  Not at all consistent with the rest of the game."

Doom,3d9bej,ultrasawblade,3,Tue Jul 14 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"That's one of the better ports from what I gather. I wish I still had my copy. The exclusive secret level actually worked on that one (it exists on the XBLA version but the switch does not trigger to access it normally). Aside from this, my vote goes to the XBLA version on 360. It plays very well for a controller too.  People also like PlayStation DOOM which updated the sounds, music and overall atmosphere, but that isn't as much of a straight port."
Doom,3d9bej,TheCrimsonKing0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:16:54 2015 UTC,Agreed on the PSX port.  It was the smoothest port at the time but the lack of the original's music and sound effects really changes the atmosphere.

Doom,3d9bej,AdKUMA,5,Tue Jul 14 15:38:15 2015 UTC,I guess it's just the doom 3 port that's hated when it comes to the BFG edition. I've never played any doom games until I bought that pack a few years ago. I enjoy the hell out of it though.
Doom,3d9bej,AdKUMA,2,Tue Jul 14 15:44:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's the reason, but the secret levels in Doom 2 in the BFG Edition were heavily censored (probably because of international release)."

Later I got a PSX and loved its version of Doom, both for the better graphics/smoother gameplay but also the wicked music and sound.  I still like playing the PSX TC in a modern source port.  I could never play a console version anymore after trying gzDoom though, I like being able to look up and down and jump too much."

In particular I don't think they can just relicense what they have to GPL without explicit approval from all contributors to the code (quite asides from the bits the have removed or replaced).

I know the G/ZDoom devs have already been working on a new audio backend to replace fmod with OpenAL, and it's been months already, with tons of bugs and regressions in the test builds.

Doom,3cupzb,General_101,3,Sat Jul 11 00:39:46 2015 UTC,I believe Doom on steam is being emulated with DOS so just do what others are telling you here and use a source port.
Doom,3cupzb,Ronald--Raygun,3,Sat Jul 11 01:02:02 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's the original graphics emulated with dosBox. So it's not gonna look pretty without some tweaks to dosbox or running it via source port like all these guys are saying below.

Doom,3cupzb,derfherdez,2,Sat Jul 11 02:23:08 2015 UTC,"They went with an ancient version of DOSBox that honestly just isn't up to the job.  It would have been nicer if they included Chocolate DOOM so at least it preserved the original game play, but also ran decently on modern machines.  Download any of the numerous source ports, point them to the wad files, and you'll be MUCH happier with something else.  Even a newer version of DOSBox for what it's worth."
Doom,3cupzb,Pepperglue,2,Sat Jul 11 03:16:58 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason the quality is so atrocious?   I'm sure it was the way it looked.

In my opinion, I loved all the DOOM games, but I have a preference for the old school over the horror FPS.  I'm glad that the default campaign with DOOM 4 will err towards the default.  I'm also glad that snapmap will give us control to make something very reminiscent of DOOM 3, provided the tool is as powerful as they're implying.  Someone above wanted a DOOM/Killing Floor mash up, and E3 revealed that as very possible.  I think really the only things up in the air would be enemy count.  Someone else mentioned 50 enemies - I'm thinking the game will hard limit the number of active hostiles at any one time, even though that kind of negates the purpose of the BFG.  But then... I'm not going to bat a lash if ye old slaughter maps are non-existent due to said limits.  Less crap to sift through for quality creations."

Maybe FEAR and/or Dead Space are more your type of games, I recommend you look into those instead.

Doom,3cstvs,jdgmntday,5,Mon Jul 13 13:59:59 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this; I really hoped Doom 4 would be another survival horror. I know we're on the losing side, and I've often wondered why people want D4 to be a run and gun shooter. That's what RAGE was supposed to be and what Quake is. Why pull the terror and dread out of my Doom experiences? My hypothesis is that the people who want D4 to be like D1&2 were already in their mid to late teens when they played Doom the first time, so the early ones weren't scary. They played them as if they were run-and-gun, kill-lots-of-everything games. I played them a lot younger, maybe 9 or 10, and to me the Doom games were terrifying. I could only get the nerve to play the first few levels, and I hated going in the dark without godmode on. I'd slowly creep through levels, saving all the ammo I could (despite there being plenty of it), be scared of every gurgle and shuffle, etc. Fast forward to D3, and now I'm 16-17. It was the terrifying survival horror game I remembered the first Dooms being, and I loved it. But I can totally see how those who played them fast and brutal were utterly disappointed in the horror direction.  Then id releases the RAGE IP, meant to be a fast paced shooter more akin to how D1&2 were played, freeing the Doom games to be a survival horror, but it failed for reasons. With the RAGE line dead and Quake sorta just MIA, id had no choice but to bring back their run and gun gameplay to their Doom line, and we get the trailer we got at E3.  Don't get me wrong. I'm going to play the shit out of it and love it. But I'll always have that wistful remorse it could be have been as slow and terrifying as D1&2 was to my 10 year old self."
Doom,3cstvs,throw-a-lion,2,Fri Jul 10 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"Very well observed. I have the same connection with Doom from my childhood so Doom 3 felt like a good/natural atmosphere to me.

Doom,3cstvs,HeavensNight,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:05:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe given that DOOM has adopted its old-school roots again, they'll announce a new project that takes another direction...? Hopefully Quake, as you said it's kinda just MIA. Let's hope they do that instead of trying to resurrect RAGE. (Although I would theorize they'd make Quake a brutally fast-paced multiplayer arena game, a throwback to Quake 3)  TFW  you realise you're speculating way too much and overhyping yourself. God, I'm way too much of an id fanboy for this. It's a difficult time for me."

Call me crazy, but I thought it kinda sucked having a room full of enemies so closely crammed together that they have to fight me one at a time.  Yeah, the enemies in Doom 3 were incredibly sparse, but it got a bit irritating in the old games when one false move would get you gang raped by cacodemons.  It comes to a point where it's less challenge and more sadism.  Lots on enemies = good, literal nonstop tidal waves of demons = no fun."

Something that makes us, if not relive, at least remember those days of original release while taking advantage of modern day technical capabilities.  If not, it's best kept unexplored or renamed to some Rage reboot.  Doom 4 today is not worth of its name, and by the looks of it it never will."

The problem is, I think, a lot of people have been playing ultra-hard Doom 2 megawads for years, so their vision of exactly what Doom was when it first came out is a bit distorted. The whole reason behind making Doom 2 was to take advantage of more powerful computers to make bigger and more complex levels with the same engine."

Doom,3cl9li,therightclique,21,Wed Jul 8 22:24:10 2015 UTC,the fact is that it needs a narrative. Modern gamers demand one.   am i the only modern gamer who thinks narratives are drag and would rather Doom4  not have one?
Doom,3cl9li,Plastic_Indian,13,Wed Jul 8 23:05:38 2015 UTC,"No, you're not.  My take on it is that it doesn't need to be so explicit.  Let the player imagine the story himself ... it will come naturally with good level design showing the progression into hell ... slowly getting more and more gruesome / demonic.  In fact, the original Doom 1 end level / start level map aids this because it gives you the 10,000 foot view of the story progression too.  The moment you have a cutscene where my character does something scripted or says something to someone, you'll ripped me out of my story and forced yours upon me.  I also want a return to ""interesting"" level architecture, rather than realistic building construction.  The original Doom team were right to discard the idea of a realistic military base (boring!) and go for things that were stunning and/or interesting.  And secrets."
Doom,3cl9li,gkopff,2,Wed Jul 8 23:36:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's possible to make a realistic base work, as long as it makes the classic doom slow transition into a corrupted military base hellscape."
Doom,3cl9li,PerfectAgent64,6,Sat Jul 11 23:04:45 2015 UTC,"You're a minority. I don't need it to be dazzled but I mean, I would love to see some elements. I loved reading the monster descriptions in the doom book and the intro story? Read it 100s of times. So yea, give me something ... There is gore fatigue. Get me vested emotionally into the game. Make me mad you murdered my marine buddies and I'm fucking you up. You don't remember reading the chapter screens that talked about hell escaping to earth? That shit amped up young me. Well I'm grown up now and yes, i want at least a minimal effort to amp me up just like that... Ready to slay bodies out of rage."
Doom,3cl9li,Capt_Tastey_Puff,10,Thu Jul 9 00:15:30 2015 UTC,"i was on doom world and i thought this sort of spoke about keeping Doom oldschool in a really good way. Their discussion was weather or not perks should be added, but the message is clear    Tetris Pac-Man Ridge Racer Super Mario Bros. Street Fighter Doom   What do these game series have in common, despite all being from completely different genres?  They are games that hinge almost exclusively on the mechanics of their gameplay. They are all institutions of simple yet addictive game design. Games for the sake of it. You can make an argument that gameplay alone can't keep someone interested in a game these days, to that I say: Either the game's core mechanics were not solid enough, or you simply do not truly enjoy the game.  There is absolutely no reason to convolute a rock-solid design in an arcade-style game with RPG elements. It's completely counter-intuitive to the goal of the gameplay. Your ""reward"" in these types of games is to hone your skill and to continually take on harder challenges to test your skill. By introducing a progression system that constantly changes the rules of the mechanics of the game, you are diluting the satisfaction of using your mastery and understanding of the game's mechanics and ruleset.   link"
Doom,3cl9li,Plastic_Indian,6,Thu Jul 9 00:37:15 2015 UTC,"Cinematic scenes keep me from playing the game, and like another user said, it forces someone else's  narration on the player. Why not just keep it open ended and tell the story from in the game? Wouldn't it speak higher of the game if they could do it with well thought out game play than to sink low and use cinematics?"
Doom,3cl9li,Plastic_Indian,0,Thu Jul 9 00:20:49 2015 UTC,"Who said anything about cinematics? Yea I don't like them either.  But how about I play through the hell invasion. My buddies get slaughtered around me for a level or two, base going to hell, a few civilians get slaughtered... Now it's fucking payback time! Like that. Let me play through a section where they are animating the monsters. Google the revanant manual description how they're demons wired to go again. Let me play through a segment with them doing that... And kill them."
Doom,3cl9li,Capt_Tastey_Puff,-1,Thu Jul 9 00:42:49 2015 UTC,"cinematic is the is the wrong word. In games a cinematic is a part that takes the control away from the player and forces you to watch a movie. you can still have full control here, and you really don't need to watch it. how long would it take you to find that corpse on your own? even for the later more complicated hologram puzzles, if you have already played through the game, you can just skip it and there wont be any change in pace once you get tired of story and just want to play because you should already know where the key is. as for taking away your personal narrative? it doesn't characterize the main character at all, and when has it ever been a thing that the world should be your own narrative? ""in my narrative it was my little ponies that brought hell to us and it had nothing to do with teleporters, Im talking about doom 1 not doom 4 obviously"""
Doom,3cl9li,darkjesusfish,0,Thu Jul 9 06:17:03 2015 UTC,"Why shouldn't it?  I mean, it doesn't need to have ridiculous, over-the-top Call of Duty cutscenes, but I want it to have a story.  If I'm paying $60 for a game, it better have an enjoyable story (even if it's all in the background, via collectible tapes and such) to complement the gameplay.  Narrative isn't going to kill Doom, more like a lack of it definitely will.  The biggest complaint about modern shooters is the lack of story, so what makes you think removing it is going to save the game?  This is 2015, a few paragraphs at the end of each chapter is nowhere near acceptable."

Doom,3cl9li,Captain_Kuhl,9,Thu Jul 9 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"most exciting, progressive moment is a quiet one with no shooting   Yeah I greatly enjoyed Delta Labs 1 too..... you aren't talking about that level, you're talking about the non-representative trailer...  But seriously, Delta 1 is easily my favorite level in Doom 3. Takes all the monsters away from you, lets you wander and work yourself up over whether that shadow is actually an imp ready to attack this time. You sense them toying with you, letting you get all the way to the data linker and back before actually sending monsters out.  Only way it would have been better, IMO, would be to hold off on the monsters until you start the reactor, when you've pushed so far into the base without encountering actual resistance it would be even more of a surprise that they were all there all waiting for you."
Doom,3cl9li,kamishizuka,8,Wed Jul 8 22:33:50 2015 UTC,I only have one little wish for Doom 4 and that is a modern remake of E1M1. They don't have to point it out - I just want to be wandering down a corridor and suddenly recognise the room I'm in.
Doom,3cl9li,Nicksaurus,4,Thu Jul 9 11:09:32 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! I really hoped for that and I didn't get that at all from Doom3. There is some (not all, but some) architecture in the original Doom (and Doom2) that is interesting enough to stand on it's own feet in a modern engine without needing to change it beyond recognition, and also distinctive enough to give that ""whoah!"" moment for the fans.  The most important areas to sneak into Doom4 would be Doom's E1M1 (and DoomII's M1 because more people are familiar with it), but for me, the section in Doom E1M3 where the angular corridor ceiling has a matching slot running down it revealing the sky (the corridor before you reach the outside oval path above toxic waste) and angular grates in the wall etc - that corridor is just quintessential Doom to me :D"
Doom,3cl9li,D-Alembert,7,Thu Jul 9 18:31:34 2015 UTC,"I think he meant a hellknight, not a Baron. As we've seen, the Baron will be a big horned bastard in Doom 4.  But I agree with the general sentiment. The best way to tell the story is visually rather than through a ton of intrusive cutscenes- it's there if you want to look for it, but you could just keep dashing along blasting through demons."
Doom,3cl9li,captaincrunchey,6,Wed Jul 8 21:19:02 2015 UTC,The problem is how often we're going to see the same kind of storytelling. Are we going to have to go through this hand process a dozen times in the game?

The Baron is in back, clearly not as big as the Cyberdemon we saw, but much larger than a hellknight.  EDIT: And just after digging that up, I noticed a hellknight is punching the Baron. Monster infighting confirmed?"

Doom,3cl9li,PaulBlackMetal,2,Wed Jul 8 22:52:59 2015 UTC,It might be scripted in the e3 gameplay video but as Doom guy enters one of the double doors you see a Revenant pulling the arms off an IMP and chucking it.

Doom,3cl9li,darkjesusfish,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:57:12 2015 UTC,"monster infighting is most definitely confirmed. I could have sworn they made a statement about it, but I can't find it, so maybe Im crazy . In the e3 reveal during the first bout an Imp goes strait for a zombieman just before the player kills him, and during the snap-map demo the player switches a ""demon fight"" switch and then watches two sets of demons fight. there are at least 10 of them and I think that is the most we have seen onscreen at the same time so far. one of them also has a glowing green shield, this is the only time we see shield zombiemen in the demo."
Doom,3cl9li,therightclique,19,Thu Jul 9 06:32:42 2015 UTC,This is some of the most pretentious video game writing I've ever heard. It reeks of a kid that just learned a new word.
Doom,3cl9li,pastamanrofl,3,Wed Jul 8 22:07:44 2015 UTC,"I surmise that a lot of folks , for whatever reason, expected Doom 4 to be more like the classic Doom games rather than a more modern experience. You have to remember that Doom 3 was and is part of the franchise. A lot of people played that as their introduction to the series and loved it. I'm not saying it was perfect, lord knows it wasn't, but it's still Doom to many people.   Having said that, there is a place in Doom for fast paced crazy action AND slowed down, creepy atmosphere. I love both and it's a good balance of the two that I really want to see. Don't beat me over the head with story -- show, don't tell -- and let my brain fill in the gaps."
Doom,3cl9li,Scissorman1985,3,Thu Jul 9 14:03:04 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with this and have reiterated what you have said here in he past. It is true that lots of the kids who played Doom 3 10 years ago, was their Doom experience. I don't see why they can't have elements of both. I hope one or 2 levels are made just to creep you out--perhaps through a bonus level. It's all about pacing and mixing things up, the reason why Serious Sam was boring to me is because it just hits on the Same note throughout the entire game. Even the original Doom would vary the pacing. id's challenge is going to make a game that mostly resembles the original but I am hoping there are some horror elements in it as well. The scene that this article talks about I think does that...and if id can make a handful of these type of moments across the game it will be an awesome thing."
Doom,3cl9li,Capt_Tastey_Puff,5,Thu Jul 9 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"Ideally, DooM 4 should have an understated narrative in the same way Dark Souls and Bloodborne do. Yeah, those games had cutscenes and characters, but their stories weren't reliant upon them. They always gave the player just enough information to let his/her imagination fill out the blanks. Stories told through implication instead of outright exposition; my favorite kind of story-telling. DooM 4 can have all the over-the-top action and gore it wants and be awesome for it, but it can become something even greater by contrasting all that insanity with a degree of restraint."
Doom,3cl9li,Mcflexington,2,Thu Jul 9 18:05:03 2015 UTC,"I really want a factory level like in the quake games, showing you processing for demons."
Doom,3cl9li,Gatekeepah,2,Wed Jul 8 20:25:04 2015 UTC,"the fact is that it needs a narrative. Modern gamers demand one.   NO. Please, no. Doom has always been, and always should be just game. Just good game."
Doom,3cl9li,Mcflexington,3,Thu Jul 9 03:02:25 2015 UTC,"Love the Dunk reference, and while I kind-of agree, I think DooM having a story would be great.   Hear me out!  I DO NOT think they should have cut-scenes, or any humans alive talking to your character, shit like that, etc... I think the original DooM had a great narrative. You're given a premise, and as you explore through the UAC bases, they slowly descend into more hellish lairs... the new DooM could do this perfectly, especially with modern gameplay mechanics. The entire story is in the surroundings. As you progress, you realize how fucked up everything is, be it from weird, hellish corruptions (almost tumor-like things) covering the walls of the base, to those little drone messages where you see people getting mutilated. Stuff like that.   These games can have story and be a great game, all while not taking you out of (or away from) any action, IMO. What are your thoughts?"
Doom,3cl9li,Gatekeepah,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:11:38 2015 UTC,"That sounds completely enjoyable and it doesn't go against what Doom is at all. It's always been a game that said a lot without using words. Great idea, friend."

Doom,3cit4p,ChappyWagon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:36:35 2015 UTC,Could it be an Arch Vile resurrecting an enemy? It makes the crackling bone/meat sound you hear when you blow up an enemy.
Doom,3cit4p,samus12345,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:44:52 2015 UTC,The imp snorting sound?
Doom,3cit4p,Madsy9,2,Wed Jul 8 20:20:22 2015 UTC,"So, just for fun I checked the Chocolate Doom source port for this sound. Chocolate Doom is a Doom port which is faithful to classic doom, which tries to keep all the bugs while at the same time making the code run on modern machines.  So I found the lump of the sound in the DOOM WAD file named as ""DSDMACT"". The C enum which represents that a monster should use this sound is called sfx_dmact, and is found in sounds.h, line 192.  So I told my editor to find all references of this enum, and it gave me the following results, all in info.c :   line 1433, active sound for Thing MT_SERGEANT (Pinky) line 1459, active sound for Thing MT_SHADOWS (Spectre) line 1485, active sound for Thing MT_HEAD (Cacodemon) line 1511, active sound for Thing MT_BRUISER (Baron of hell) line 1563, active sound for Thing MT_KNIGHT (Hellknight) line 1589, active sound for Thing MT_SKULL (Lost soul) line 1615, active sound for Thing MT_SPIDER (Pinky) line 1667, active sound for Thing MT_CYBORG (Cyberdemon) line 1693, active sound for Thing MT_PAIN (Pain elemental)   The usages are in an array named mobjinfo of type mobjinfo_t, a huge lookup table with data on each enemy. So, it's the sound most (but not all) monsters make when they are active and walking around, but do not have the player in sight. Until I did this, I thought it only was the active sound of the pinky and spectre."
Doom,3cit4p,D-Alembert,2,Wed Jul 8 20:46:10 2015 UTC,I assume it's mean to be monsterous growling breathing. It sounds like air rumbling in-out (or out-in)?

Doom,3cg80k,uebersoldat,0,Wed Jul 8 21:09:47 2015 UTC,"They will do well to have big open maze-like maps and not linear, corridor style maps.   If it's the latter, well, good luck. I'm not paying for Brutal Doom3.   EDIT: Hell...Bobby Prince thrown in there wouldn't hurt a damned thing either >_>"
Doom,3cg80k,TheGamePhilosophe,4,Tue Jul 7 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"Technically most Doom maps were linear, sure it made you go off to either the left or right to get a key or pull a lever that would open a door back on the main path but it was still linear in the case where there was one way in and one way out for the most part. Doom 3 barely had any of that or it wasn't done as well because the areas were so small and didn't give a sense that you were exploring something.  As long as music goes they have already reproduced one song (e3 Trailer) and I'm sure that won't be the last of it.  We shall wait and see how well they do but from what I've seen, I'm already SOLD."
Doom,3cg80k,uebersoldat,6,Tue Jul 7 20:18:48 2015 UTC,"When people talk about non-linearity in Doom, then don't mean multiple endings or mission outcomes. They are referring to the fact that the maps were open to exploration in multiple directions from the outset, like a maze, and that it was the player's task to figure out what was where in terms of key cards, switches, and items.  FPS's today do not use this labyrinthine design for levels. Instead, they usher the player from room to room, often closing off the pathway back and enforcing constant forward motion.  Sure, in the end the outcome is the same in both. You get to the final room and exit the level. But there's a real difference between being set down in the middle of the map and having to investigate multiple pathways to get the things you need and find the exit versus simply being told, ""go to this room, defeat these enemies, now go to this room,"" and so on.  Doom was never just monsters. It was mazes AND monsters."
Doom,3cg80k,DamagedHells,2,Wed Jul 8 02:59:31 2015 UTC,"On your point of the keycards and linearity of the progression (blue, yellow, red). The thing there is no one held your hand on where to find them. you had to explore an organically designed maze of a level that in many cases had a lot of charm (thank you Romero!) and personality to find those keys. Sometimes you needn't even get them all."

Doom,3c6zks,RoadRunnerdn,4,Sun Jul 5 20:47:39 2015 UTC,"Not sure I follow.  Looks like a sequel to DOOM to me.  3 only topped out at 2 monsters on screen at a time, and that was because one was already in the hall when another jumped out of the wall.  I counted 8 in the first room of the DOOM 2016 reveal alone.  That's a pretty sizable number for a first encounter, the player just didn't get an angle on them all.  If those second four showed up precisely following the death of the first four isn't revealed, but then, this isn't the only moment with more than a handful of baddies in the same room as the player.    Movement was fast, the shotgun admittedly a little sloppy, the rooms are well lit so that there is no need for a flash light.  Multiple weapons, lots of dudes trying to kill the player at once.  Seems pretty classic DOOM to me, AND it's tapping into all the potential of today's game concepts like weapon attachments/secondary functions and double jumping/mantling, but keeping true to old school health and armor mechanics.  Hardware and AI programming has evolved to the point where enemies do more than just walk around in circles with some emphasis on moving directly towards the player.  I'm thinking the problem isn't that the game doesn't have any potential, so much as you can't see it.  No, DOOM 2016 isn't 2D, but eh... it's 2016.  I enjoy my Project Brutality.  I'll probably play both when the new DOOM is released as long as new wads are built for the originals and new maps/campaigns for the new DOOM.  I trust ID to make a great DOOM that stays true to the roots of the old DOOM games, but isn't merely a carbon copy ""graphics update"" of the old DOOMs.  That won't last I imagine - those in love with the originals WILL find an excuse to go back to the originals."
Doom,3c6lvq,Niemand7,2,Sun Jul 5 09:26:16 2015 UTC,Lol... Loved this. Until I found console commands and spawned a army of them. Ruined my play through in a way. They just beat the monsters for me now. Would like to know how to kill them down when there's to many.

Doom,3c3k12,SnowGabe,5,Sat Jul 4 16:24:14 2015 UTC,"It's already a mod. He released the file as a .WAD, so you just load the doom IWAD then load IDKFA1.WAD on the command line (or even easier using ZDL)."

Doom,3bzg92,raccjoe,6,Fri Jul 3 13:40:08 2015 UTC,I like the new logo. It's an effective contrast to whatever hellish backdrop it's set against.
Doom,3bzg92,Scissorman1985,22,Fri Jul 3 20:03:48 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who like the new logo ?
Doom,3bzg92,_KetzA,19,Fri Jul 3 16:11:29 2015 UTC,"I think anyone that understands the fundamentals of logo design would prefer the new logo.  Neutral colour scheme = goes anywhere. The yellow + grey will look weird on any image that doesn't share the palette.  Focuses on the recognizable silhouette rather than details. Shape is always the most important part of a logo, as it is the first thing we'll notice.  I'd go as far as to say that the new logo is actually a logo, and the old one is more akin to an artwork. It's strictly better at being a logo than what we had before."
Doom,3bzg92,BigSmashy,9,Fri Jul 3 17:08:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the bew logo is much more effective in more situations. I can be applied to virtually any box art or background. The original logo is great, an ivonic, but is much harder to work with, and honestly, it really does look like a product of its time. So, /r/doom needs to chill out and accept that the new Doom is a new game. Stop wanting it to be 100% exactly like doom 1, because that game already exists, and u can play it today."
Doom,3bzg92,Angry_and_cold,7,Sat Jul 4 00:55:46 2015 UTC,"They did the same thing with the logo redesign for QuakeCon. It's very basic, single color, but that silhouette is very recognizable."

Doom,3bzg92,therightclique,5,Tue Jul 21 01:53:49 2015 UTC,"it's not bad as like a brother logo, I still think they should update the original like they did in 2003."
Doom,3bzg92,Plastic_Indian,4,Fri Jul 3 16:45:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know, looking at the graphic style (especially the HUD) of the demo, I think this minimalistic logo fits perfectly well."

Doom,3bzg92,BigSmashy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:05:26 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on what the goal is. The original logo told you more about the game.
Doom,3bzg92,therightclique,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:04 2015 UTC,"That's a fair observation, but if we approach it this way, the original was less of a logo and more of a piece of artwork, which is perfectly good in its own right, but at this point, they're entirely different things meant to accomplish entirely different goals."
Doom,3bzg92,BigSmashy,5,Tue Jul 21 11:17:08 2015 UTC,I live how the original looks. But the new one is an overall better logo.

Doom,3bzg92,sedkiller,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:10:19 2015 UTC,That seems slightly less insulting.
Doom,3bzg92,therightclique,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:13 2015 UTC,"It makes no sense to consider it the real Doom 3. It wasn't made by id. It was mostly a console cash in. It didn't further the series in any meaningful way. Doom 3 did all of these things, even if it wasn't the Doom sequel we wanted."
Doom,3bzg92,therightclique,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:00 2015 UTC,"It does make sense in a way. Its development was at least supervised by id, the story continues right were the original games ended (instead of retelling/rebooting it) and it furthered the series just as much as Doom 2 did after Doom 1. Even more from a technical viewpoint, enhancing upon the game engine and all."
Doom,3bzg92,cenorexia,2,Tue Jul 21 03:32:04 2015 UTC,Ya I really dont care for the new logo it just seems lazy
Doom,3bzg92,BlackSmokeDemonII,2,Wed Jul 8 07:16:36 2015 UTC,There's a very good reason it seems lazy.
Doom,3bzg92,therightclique,2,Tue Jul 21 01:59:36 2015 UTC,I didn't know about the new logo. That is ugly as sin. Can't beat the original.
Doom,3bzg92,foolofatook29,3,Sat Jul 4 05:04:07 2015 UTC,"ITT a lot of people who like the new logo on the basis that it adheres to the standards of what a good logo should be: something minimalistic, that can be easily recognized even after being xeroxed/included in corporate documents, etc.  But that shouldn't be a logo, it should be a title screen first of all. As such, the old ones were awesome. They were perfectly in tune with the mood of the game: gory and rock and roll. Audacious. Fuck this minimalistic crap. I don't much care for a sublime and harmoniously proportioned fuckin' font when I'm setting out to eviscerate some imps. I want something nasty, because that's what the game is.   The old font looked like it was cut out from a piece of meat, and it was perfect."
Doom,3bzg92,somedud,2,Sat Jul 4 08:59:23 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer.   These ""logos should be minimalistic"" people would have you believe the best logo is single dot in the middle of a sheet of paper."

But yes, people have attempted hacking. but the hex is really difficult to follow as they had to cram it all in, Needless to say, they REALLY packed Doom in tight, so people have tried and given up.

Doom,3by4tk,imaximus101,2,Mon Jul 6 03:07:43 2015 UTC,"Good list, you got a new subscriber :)  I love the artistic style of all the Doom 1 and Doom 2 monsters. They were incredibly detailed for their time and considering the size of the sprites, and they are very colorful unlike many monsters/enemies in today's games. Monsters had several animations for when they fired their weapon, took damage, etc, and every frame in those animations had to repeated 8 times; once for each direction you could view the enemy from. North, north-east, east, south-east, etc.  From a game mechanic perspective, there is a lot to say about the doom monsters. I really love the pinkies and how they strafe the player to avoid fire. We like to think that Doom's AI by today's standard is unimpressive, but my opinion is that the AI of Doom's monsters is underappreciated. Strafing monsters, healing/resurrecting monsters, monster infighting.. it's quite amazing all the subtle stuff id Software managed to squeeze in.  When attempting to pick a favorite, I'm torn between the Arch-vile and the Pain elemental. I love the Pain elemental for being a monster which spawns a possible limitless supply of other monsters. If you don't take it out in time, you can quickly get overrun by Lost souls. Lost souls are the fastest monster in the game, and is also the only monster which can crash the game. (if they accidentally spawn outside the map)  I love the Archvile out of the sheer creepiness factor. id designed its death cry by taking the recording of a little girl shouting ""Whyyyy..."" and modulating it with a bunch of other sounds. In addition, there is something special with a monster which kills you only by looking at it, at no matter the distance. Makes me think of the greek mythology about Medusa."
Doom,3by4tk,pandemonium91,2,Fri Jul 3 10:25:03 2015 UTC,Nice job.... Cacodemon should be #1.  Icon of sin shouldn't count. Just my opinions.

It's good that you left the volume of the music a bit lower, some videos like this have too loud music that makes the voice track hard to hear.  I'd suggest standing a bit farther from the mic and speaking louder. It sounds like you're sitting close and trying not to speak loud, which can come across like you lack enthusiasm. The Archvile segment and the last one sound best, IMO. For the DeviantArt drawings, you should credit the creators if you know their names.   (Btw, ""Mancubus"" is pronounced with an accent on the first syllable. Kudos for taking on a Revenant with the pistol! The ""how does sex work"" part was great.)"

They can find room to assign each weapon to a key, even if the weapon wheel is carried over into the PC version because that still floats some people's boats.  The yellow filter is in-so-far exclusive to areas with molten steel providing 90% of the lighting, and Hell, which gives the air a fetid stenchy look.  Until the smell-o-vision exists, it's an alternative method to selling the atmosphere.  Otherwise, the videos very clearly show us clear lit rooms, cold blue hue lighting, dark blueish lighting, etc.  But people continue to act like these bits don't exist.  Why?   Because I gaurantee 24 out of 25 of the schmucks crying foul on the persistence of the game having a yellow filter - not just certain areas with certain lighting conditions having a yellow hue - wouldn't have noticed until the other 1 out of the 25 said something.  Most people aren't actually all that perceptive to small details, they only pretend to be.  Case in point - the blue and clear lit rooms interspersed through the demo reels.  And that's just two out of many perceived problems blown way out of proportion, because if gamers by and large have any major shortcomings, it's that they're prone to hyperbole and hysterics and can't be reasoned with.  It's why smart developers tend not to reveal things until they're absolutely ready and firmly refuse to budge over any complaints."
Doom,3bvlyz,TurboBr0,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:57:05 2015 UTC,Stay away from /r/pcgaming if cherry picking arguments annoy you. Most people there expected them to just rerelease doom2.wad rather than what looks like a neat reimagining of the games. Heard the same shit from Wolf TNO and that turned out to be one of my favourite recent shooters.
Doom,3bvlyz,kiros_winstone,-2,Wed Jul 8 07:31:56 2015 UTC,"It's hard to speculate, we're only going off trailer demo footage at this time. But yes, I'm sure the PC version won't be featuring a weapon wheel.  I don't particularly give a fuck about the ""yellow filter"" or any other cosmetic effect. I care about the core gameplay mechanics, which at this point look fairly disappointing.  Of course, this is purely subjective. But it just looks like it fits into the generic FPS genre section of any local game store. And I can't help but feel if they didn't have to take the console community into consideration, they wouldn't have had as many limitations holding them back.  Also, we're missing John Romero. That is what I truly feel makes Doom, Doom."
Doom,3bvlyz,Littleman88,2,Sun Jul 5 04:02:16 2015 UTC,"The footage we've seen of the new DOOM is no less generic than the original DOOMs were.  At the time, EVERY shooter was 2D, had colorful enemies, and lots of really big guns.  Blood.  Duke Nukem 3D.  Blake Stone (more like Wolf 3D though.)  Heretic.  Hexen.  Strife.  Hell, Hexen did what they originally planned to do with DOOM in terms of levels.  DOOM stood out the most for various reasons, but if I had to guess on the big one, it's because it was the simplest of the bunch.  No inventories to fiddle with.  No puzzles across multiple levels to figure out.  Just go in, shoot stuff, move on.  Also, shareware + violent video game controversy.  Bound to drum up interest, and probably ended up being many a kid's first FPS, let alone bloody ""M"" rated game (had the ESRB existed at the time.)  DOOM 2016 looks to offer a lot of the same, plus features that weren't really a thing at the time, like mantling and take downs/executions.  New weapons like a rail gun to fill the missing role of a sniper rifle of sorts.  Attachments for weapons for secondary functions.  These aren't old DOOM, but I consider them logical improvements and additions on what is DOOM.  John Romero didn't make DOOM, DOOM either.  He was a part of the process, sure, considering how long that game's credits are, a large part of it, but that was the ground work for the franchise.  He in no way was the sole reason DOOM is so nostalgically remembered.  Really, you might as well be saying, ""it isn't 2D, so it isn't DOOM.""  Play DOOM if you want to play DOOM.  DOOM 2016 isn't going to be exactly old school DOOM, but it will try to improve on old DOOM to become a better DOOM, because not surprisingly, people obsessed with it becoming exactly like old DOOM will still find a reason to go back to old DOOM, regardless if DOOM 2016 is 100% accurate or not.  Developers should look back and take notes on older games, but they shouldn't pander entirely to those wearing rose tinted glasses.  That's a recipe for disaster.  Somehow, some way, the classics will ALWAYS be better in these fans' eyes."
Doom,3bvlyz,darkjesusfish,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:32:10 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with your statement about the original dooms being generic. half the games you listed as examples to why the game wasn't a standout were based off the doom engine. it wasn't generic, it was the genre.  but otherwise I agree with you. I find it funny how many people in this sub think they are doom puritans, yet they all use game changing mods.  Y-axes aiming? made popular because the rise of decent mouse's made the original keyboard-centric control system too easy. Jumping? made popular because people are stupid and want a useless mechanic that brakes many parts of the game (the gantlet, Im looking at you). mods have used both to make great games, but I will never defile my original doom experience by using either.   I don't want doom 4 (wont call it anything else) to be doom 1&2. doom 1&2 already did that perfectly, and I don't respect the opinion of anyone that needs mods for that to be true."
Doom,3bvlyz,kiros_winstone,-1,Mon Jul 6 01:52:44 2015 UTC,"The footage we've seen of the new DOOM is no less generic than the original DOOMs were.    You clearly have no idea what you're talking about. Along with being the engine of the 90's, it also boasted a handful of innovative ideas, design concepts, and graphical detail. What the fuck is Doom 4 boasting? Double jump? There's nothing in the gameplay footage that I haven't seen before, so there's no wow factor.   John Romero didn't make DOOM, DOOM either. He was a part of the process   And he was a very big part of that process, in fact a lot of the design elements were his idea. He left the company because ID began to half-ass everything so they could push the product out the door and make a profit. Which I think perfectly sums up the current gaming industry.   Really, you might as well be saying, ""it isn't 2D, so it isn't DOOM.   That's not at all what I'm saying. It's not Doom unless you have ground-breaking graphics, and innovative design and features. What I'm seeing at the moment just looks like your standard cut'n'paste formulae for the common FPS shooter. Nothing particularly stands out, and the weaponry is kind of a joke.  Big guns, Big impact, Swarms of demons. That's Doom."

Doom,3bvlyz,kiros_winstone,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:59:12 2015 UTC,"DOOM has no jumping, map design technology was limited to the point that there couldn't be walk ways intersecting on the horizontal planes with entities standing on two different vertical coordinates.  No reload mechanics.  No zoom mechanics.  No inventory management mechanic (Heretic allowed a player to haul around what were essentially medipaks and assorted power ups for on demand consumption for example.)  ""Leading the way"" isn't what makes a game good.  Yes, DOOM was innovative at the time.  Being the first through the door to actually do something tends to do that.  Halo kind of did that for consoles (and regenerative health + normal health) by doing console FPS game play very right and it was essentially a form of DOOM, just with space aliens and vehicles.  Shoot, didn't take long for people to line up the Chief next to Doom guy.    DOOM II?  Anyone today would call that an expansion pack.  DOOM itself is a basic level FPS.  It's great partly because of that, but I can't play it without engines that bring its controls up to modern day standards.  It has a pistol, a shotgun, an automatic, a rocket launcher, another automatic, and a room clearer oh $#!% button.  And you're calling the weaponry in DOOM 4 a joke?  These are staples in any FPS, except maybe the last one (but in their defense, they don't have giant bipedal goats packing rapid fire rocket launchers either.)  DOOM laid the foundation of the FPS.  It was innovative at the time, but it's not the shining example of a perfect FPS.  FPS game play has been vastly improved on and added to since then.  It's a genre refined over 20 years.  I'm sure for most people, engines like ZDOOM and mods have kept it relevant and fun.  I hope you have some good ideas to innovate, because I can guarantee they've been tried and denied.  The ol' ""good on paper, bad in  practice"" rule.  An actual innovation that isn't crap for a game is very, very hard to conceptualize.  Most ""innovation"" is going to happen within the DOOM family at this point - Doom guy driving a rover means new demons that can keep up with and engage that rover.  DOOM gave us the FPS' we enjoy today, but rating the next iteration of DOOM on what it changes within the industry is so seriously flawed.  Simply put, DOOM 4 should be rated on its own merits, not on how it compares to DOOM 1/2, or what it changes within the industry.  Best case scenario, the FPS industry  ditches the ""modern warfare"" era entirely and looks more towards being fun games that send us on power trips, not interactive action movie flicks where we're a voiceless actor.  So really, all I have to say in closing is: since it sounds like you DON'T want DOOM 4 to be the game for you, stick with DOOM I and DOOM II."
Doom,3bvlyz,Scissorman1985,0,Mon Jul 6 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"No reload mechanics. No zoom mechanics.    We're talking about the early 90's here, how much did you honestly expect?   No inventory management mechanic (Heretic allowed a player to haul around what were essentially medipaks and assorted power ups for on demand consumption for example.)   Romero was an executive producer on Raven Software's Heretic and Hexen.   DOOM itself is a basic level FPS. It's great partly because of that, but I can't play it without engines that bring its controls up to modern day standards.    It's considered the grandfather of the modern FPS shooter genre, in addition you're talking about a game that was designed in 1993, and you're giving it shit because it didn't have Zoom capabilities? Right.   It was innovative at the time, but it's not the shining example of a perfect FPS. FPS game play has been vastly improved on and added to since then.   Honestly, I disagree. I think it's a perfect example of a game that did all the right things. They kept the storyline minimal, because they understood players just wanted to kill stuff. So that's exactly what they did. Same applies to Quake, and here's an example of what modern gaming companies are currently doing with their titles.   DOOM 4 should be rated on its own merits   Sure, I agree. It's a reboot. But even going off that principle I still believe it's fundamentally designed poorly. The visuals and soundtrack are spot-on, but everything else is just..generic.    Best case scenario, the FPS industry ditches the ""modern warfare"" era entirely and looks more towards being fun games that send us on power trips, not interactive action movie flicks where we're a voiceless actor.   I agree 100%, although a voiceless actor does allow you to assume the character role much better.   sounds like you DON'T want DOOM 4 to be the game for you   Implying that I'm coming from a biased perspective? If the game was designed better, it would be a game for me. Unfortunately, it will probably turn out exactly as I've predicted. Just another generic FPS you buy, play once, then move on to something else and forget about it. Alas, games like Half-life and Doom left a profound impact on the gaming community, and are still actively played to this day.  What I'm saying is, if Doom 4 can't live up to the reputation it's made for itself, then don't bother at all. Same applies to other game franchises."

Doom,3bvlyz,Indoctrinator,0,Sat Jul 4 19:12:43 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound like we should expect much in terms of enemy count on screen at once. Stratton tried to dodge that question a bit, but it's pretty clear that the numbers won't be too much higher than what we saw.  However, it sounds like this lack of on-screen enemies will be made up for by an abundance of barrels."

Interpret it how you want, they were talking about number of enemies on screen at once, not the total number of enemies on stage.    But only ever saw 5 or 6 on screen at once.   Stratton clearly said:   We showed a very limited part of the game.   And for the first level 5 or 6 enemies at once is OK. Also the Hell level in the trailer had like 8 stronger enemies on screen at once, a Baron, two Knights, two Pinkies, two Imps and a Cacodemon."
Doom,3bvlyz,TheGamePhilosophe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:55:02 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I would love for there to be parts similar to Doom II, where you would open the door and they would be like 15 Pinkies in a room, and you turn the other way to find another 10 Imps facing you.  I guess if he flat out said ""oh, there are stages where we have up to 15 baddies on screen at once."" I'll feel more convinced.   Guess we will just have to wait a see.   But I think his comment on controlling the number of AI they have on screen at once, was an indirect way of saying that they sacrificed numbers, for more intelligent demons. Again, just my take."

But I think his comment on controlling the number of AI they have on screen at once, was an indirect way of saying that they sacrificed numbers, for more intelligent demons   Yes its obvious that the more complex( graphics and AI) the enemies are the less they can put on screen, but that doesn't mean there are going to be few of them at once. I sure think that they are going to use all available resources and put on screen as much as they can, besides i don't now what is your criteria for number of enemies, i sure wouldn't like a million of retarded enemies.

I think a lot of us (me included) have these old memories of certain parts of Doom/Doom II where there was like 20+ demons coming after you.   Another thing I couldn't tell from the trailer (maybe i didn't look hard enough) that I hope they have in, is monster infighting. One of my favorite things to do in the old games was to just circle around a large group of enemies with guns/projectiles and let them get in each other's crossfire. Then just watch as they go after each other. Good fun.   I'm kinda glad this isn't coming out till next year, as much as I wanna play it. With Fallout 4, and SW Battlefront coming out in November, there will just be too much to play!"

Doom,3bvlyz,kiros_winstone,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:02:38 2015 UTC,"Proof?  Edit: Regarding the interview response about enemies on-screen: Stratton never says outright that there will be moments with lots of enemies on the screen at once. His answer is more ambiguous, because ""man I plowed through a lot of enemies"" doesn't indicate that those would be enemies on-screen at one time.  You also should pay attention to the way he handles the question before this statement. He avoids a direct answer at first and instead gives a non-answer by talking about how some fans liked shooting lots of enemies.  Then, after the quote, he quickly changes the subject to something he can talk more positively about, and goes on about how you can place lots of barrels in SnapMap. He glosses over the enemy count issue again by making the off-hand remark about putting as many enemies in before the ""system crashes.""  The fact is, if he could have given a strong answer to the question (""yeah, there will be tons of enemies on-screen at once, way more than what you saw in the demo"") then he would have. But he didn't and instead danced around it by being vague and talking about other stuff."
Doom,3bvlyz,Scissorman1985,3,Thu Jul 2 22:57:46 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/a/ZO4k7  I don't think he avoided the question, i think he answered all the parts of the question, not only the part that you wanted to be answered.   First he answered the question and then he confirmed the statement about the showcase.   GC: but is that a priority for you(many enemies on screen)? Because it wasn’t particularly evident at the showcase.  MS: Sure, sure. We showed a very limited part of the game.   Then he confirmed the first part of the question/statement   GC: One of my favourite elements of the old Doom games is the sheer number of enemies on-screen at once, which you don’t really get nowadays.  MS: But I think you’re right, I think there are people, particularly Doom fans, who like that experience of whipping out the chaingun and [does impression of using a chaingun].   Then he confirms the statement that complexity means less enemies   GC:  I know the complexity of character models today makes that difficult,   and   GC:  Because that was a big difference compared to Quake, which definitely couldn’t have that many monsters on screen.  MS: But, yeah. We’re always struggling against the number of AI we have on-screen, and that kind of thing   And then he confirms again about the number of enemies   MS: but I think fans will definitely get those moments of, 'Wow! I just ploughed my way through a lot of enemies!'   And then he talks about barrels and lots of enemies until system crashes which in my opinion is not changing the subject but implying that the developers are doing their best to make maps with as much enemies as possible, until all resources are used.    But they just try to make these maps where it’s just [makes chaingun noise again] down a hall with a chaingun!   The answer is ambiguous if you want it to be."

Doom,3bp9rc,meatspun,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:30:15 2015 UTC,They used to sell CDs full of custom wads. I bought one or two back in the day but like you said it was just endless crappy wads.
Doom,3bp9rc,meatspun,2,Wed Jul 1 14:31:00 2015 UTC,Found an ISO image on The Internet Archive here. Just the 5mb shareware installer.  Looks like Gold Medallion was a software compilation reseller and this was part of a 10 disk set. I'm sure the price of a cd was the same no matter how much data was put on it. The data from all 10 games could probably fit on one disk but a box of 10 disks would have been more attractive to the customers.
Doom,3bp9rc,aukondk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:57:40 2015 UTC,"you are correct about what can fit on a cd, i remember one of the first things my brother and I did when we first got a cd burner was to create ""the Master disk"". it contained Doom, Doom 2, Heretic, Hexen, Quake and wolf 3d. All pre-configured and playable directly from the disc. We did this so we could play the games on our schools computers without installing anything.   it was our way of circumventing the schools then 'IT policy'.  load times were horrid but once the game was up and running it was fine.     Good times. edit:spelling and grammar"
Doom,3bp9rc,mylo9000,2,Wed Jul 1 17:38:08 2015 UTC,"Funny.  I helped runCat5 cable, network my high school and set up our server.  When I did, I created a private folder on the main server for my stuff.  In it, I installed a copy of Quake so that myself and a select few others could deathmatch on the school's network.  We had lots of fun with it until some crybaby soccer mom complained.  We played Microsoft Hearts after that."

Once I found the killer quake pack (kqp), its all we ended up playing. So many lunches were had while shooting guided rocketsn and ginger heads at each other. It made high school beareble for us loners. Still think back to those games from time to time. I even have a backup of most of the maps and mods we used to play. Break them out every now and again to relive past glory."

It's attack is weaker than the cyber demon but it can attack faster. I anyways liked spawning random combos against each other. Like 40 imps vs. 1 spider mastermind
Doom,3bn9z9,MethAintAllBad,2,Wed Jul 1 10:46:16 2015 UTC,"Depends how close the mastermind is to the cybie. The farther apart they are, the more the battle tips in favor of the cyberdemon. The room in Gotcha! with the two of them probably has the cybie come out with just above a 50% winrate. The distance between the two isn't quite offset by the cybie's 1000 extra health"

Doom,3bmlqc,Manleyman69,2,Wed Jul 1 15:41:21 2015 UTC,"One thing to do is work on concept art and continue fleshing out the overall mod in writing. It takes less time and not you or whoever else ever gets a chance to make the mod, they already have a good standing when making the final mod. You could also work on porting a few models from Doom 3, which shouldn't be too hard, and would help out a lot. You don't need to know how to mod to get a good mod going, if that makes sense."
Doom,3bmlqc,-Tyketto86-,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:51:31 2015 UTC,"I can't give concept art but I can think out the idea. Basically there will be units that consist of monsters of a certain number. For example, 100 Imps is one unit. A banner will be above the head of the unit and when you click on it; the unit makes a sound to represent you have clicked on it. You can then click on other units or terrain to give the unit an order (the Doom sound for alert).  When you give the order, the unit of 100 Imps will move as one unit but spread out as they are in ranks (think of the Nuts Wad when the monsters are rows but they move in rows as well instead of clustering together).  In terms of other models. I think the Doom 1/2 sprites should be fine. They have the movement and attacks already there. It's to program them to move and attack as one unit is the task."

Doom,3bmj1h,Tlbacardi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:07:20 2015 UTC,"Connected via ethernet, shooting registers on both PC's. Literally the game still functions its just that the player cannot move (but they can turn and shoot)..."
Doom,3bmj1h,Tlbacardi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:27:11 2015 UTC,I'd uninstall and make sure you are both on the same version of Zandronum.  Delete the config (usually zandronum-windows username.ini)  Version 2.1 was recently released.  Can you try joining the server by yourself and seeing if the issue exists just for you?  Then have your friend try by their self?  Just doesn't make sense.  Do you know if uPNP is enabled on your router?  I've seen that do funny stuff with port forwarding which might be hosing your game?
Doom,3bj92t,Hofmann83,5,Mon Jun 29 17:58:24 2015 UTC,"Oh you don't have to tell us, this is probably one of the biggest doom communities that exist.   But it's awesome to see other people recognizing the importance DOOM has had on the gaming community"
Doom,3bj92t,incindia,4,Mon Jun 29 20:48:25 2015 UTC,"I don't like the cyber demon entrance that they've been showing. You know how every large creature in every single video game and movie for the last decade does that thing where it lands, or bursts into the room or whatever, and then shoves it's head forward and lets out a demonic scream?  The old Cyberdemon (particularly the first time you ever ran into him) just kind of went ""oooooo"" and then you were being hunted. You could hear his footsteps, and your fear would peak every time the sound got louder. Oh, and you could only afford to get hit once or maybe twice if you played your cards right.  I hope this cyber demon turns out more like him, and less like the awful final boss fight from Doom 3. :("
Doom,3bj92t,DJMattB241,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:56:02 2015 UTC,I sure hope they change the head on the Cyber Demon model.  It really ruins the scariness of the whole demo.  It looks way too much like a cartoonish World of Warcraft or Diablo 3 boss.
Doom,3bj92t,memphis_dude,4,Tue Jun 30 20:58:31 2015 UTC,I love that in ever single promo for doom lately they have used a screen shot of the agitated skeleton
Doom,3bj92t,onnoj817,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:17:50 2015 UTC,Doom wouldn't be here without wolfenstein or command keen.... so id.
Doom,3bj92t,Nodnarb33,2,Tue Jun 30 04:06:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, and Wolfenstein and Commander Keen wouldn't be here without Carmack, Romero and the others. And Carmack and Romero wouldn't be here without their parents, and their parents wouldn't be here without their ancestors, and their ancestors wouldn't have been here if monkeys didn't stop living on trees and started standing straight and if they didn't create the first civilizations. And monkeys wouldn't have been here if all the organisms before them didn't evolve the way they did starting from bacteria/archaea. And bacteria wouldn't be here if it weren't for the formation of earth, sun, milky way and the whole universe. So thank you universe and bacteria for making DOOM."
Doom,3bii7s,Nicbouchard153,19,Mon Jun 29 14:35:13 2015 UTC,Doom in the perspective style of Hotline Miami would be a pretty neat take on it
Doom,3bii7s,GodofBusinesslunch,16,Mon Jun 29 15:17:06 2015 UTC,Hotline Miami in the Doom engine would also be pretty kick ass.
Doom,3bii7s,moobilygoobily,3,Mon Jun 29 17:30:59 2015 UTC,"Sadly I forgot the name, but there was a game exactly like that. It had Roguelike/lite type map generation.  Edit: It was a Doom fangame, not another franchise."

Doom,3bii7s,clockworktwelve,2,Mon Jun 29 20:38:49 2015 UTC,"I love that game, but Im talking Doom franchise fangames here."
Doom,3bii7s,ShinCoal,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:47:54 2015 UTC,D'oh.
Doom,3bii7s,clockworktwelve,5,Mon Jun 29 21:20:56 2015 UTC,"Aren't you confused with the term 'Bullet Hell'? Even quick google searches only come down to a single game called bullethead. Realm of the Mad God is sometimes compared to bullet hells, even though the topdown isn't the reason for the naming convention, I have never seen Hotline Miami being refered to by either bullet hell or bullethead. I think you have your terms mixed up.  BTW you should try to find it, but there was a roguelite topdown shooter with all the Doom weapons and monsters, maybe some good inspiration how to (not) do it."
Doom,3bii7s,ShinCoal,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:48:10 2015 UTC,"When I hear bullet hell, I think of shmups like Ikaruga; large amounts of usually slow moving bullets covering the screen you have to avoid. I wouldn't think Hotline Miami would qualify as such."
Doom,3bii7s,samus12345,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:24:50 2015 UTC,Because it doesnt. He got the idea from Realm which apparently had some dodging mechanics.  Ikaruga hardly qualifies either.

I'd definitely recommend you check out that last one, since it's a lot like the kind of game you're going for; it's a little cut and dry, though. I don't think any of these games really reached the full potential of Doom in 2D."
Doom,3bii7s,jellypox,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:33:28 2015 UTC,What is MooD please? I keep Googling but can't find anything.

Doom,3bii7s,clockworktwelve,8,Mon Jun 29 15:36:27 2015 UTC,"Also commonly and sometimes incorrectly called ""twin stick shooters"" for the concept of move with one joystick, direct fire with another.  But what you're basically proposing is playing Doom from the minimap with double IDDT enabled.  Yeah, I'd play it."
Doom,3bii7s,ChrisOfAllTrades,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:16:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, If you had the tab map with IDDT enabled twice,  and just added graphics for enemies/graphics and enviroment, you'd have a twin-stick shooter instead of a first person shooter."
Doom,3bii7s,alkatrazjr,2,Tue Jun 30 09:07:50 2015 UTC,Because OP is confused with the term Bullet Hell due to Realm of the Mad God. The other games dont even apply.
Doom,3bii7s,ShinCoal,3,Mon Jun 29 20:50:03 2015 UTC,Do it. Make it hotline Miami level bloody though!
Doom,3bii7s,inchesfromdead,2,Mon Jun 29 15:48:29 2015 UTC,Seems fitting. The playstyle of Hotline Miami with modified health values and a complete Doom setting could be a fun game to try.
Doom,3bii7s,8bitterness,2,Mon Jun 29 17:45:50 2015 UTC,This may help with some inspiration and give you some ideas
Doom,3bii7s,redheadbread,2,Mon Jun 29 18:19:30 2015 UTC,"Its on my backup CD at home (LOL wut), but I have a program from a long time ago called Doom2D. It is a side-view platform shooter, kind of like (and probably inspired by) Abuse. I will see if I can resurrect it later."

Doom,3bii7s,Baturinsky,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:21:41 2015 UTC,I played a fan-made version of Wolfenstein (Vogelstein) for Android that was made into what you are speaking of.  I imagine Doom would be very similar.  You can see the game here.  I felt it was pretty fun.
Doom,3bii7s,Tlbacardi,2,Mon Jun 29 22:21:51 2015 UTC,"Incidentally, the original Castle Wolfenstein was a top-down shooter. Back to the roots!"

Doom,3bii7s,moxie132,2,Mon Jun 29 18:47:40 2015 UTC,I think you can see the enemies with the cheat IDDT (do it 2 times)  For the other thing you need map knowledge. There was a guy that finished episode 1 blind on twitch :D http://www.twitch.tv/tarnsmandw/c/6503812

Doom,3biev1,goofballl,9,Mon Jun 29 20:01:21 2015 UTC,"Most of their problems seem to stem from inexperience with non-linear level design (being unable to navigate multiple paths, running past enemies and getting trapped deeper in the level, being frustrated at monster spawns when activating switches). I think it says a lot about the differences in level design between Doom and modern FPS. This video is suddenly not seeming so far-fetched."

Most of the servers I see are in Canada, interestingly enough, on a rather popular hosting service. So yes, North America is admittedly better served. Only way to know how bad the latency really is, though, is to give it a try yourself.  You can run a server yourself, too, of course. If you start it from inside the server browser, it'll get published onto the list of servers so other players can find you. Don't expect to host a 64-player frag-fest unless your Internet connection has a fast upstream throughput, but hosting a four-player co-op game should be fine."

Was the level creator asked or did these publishers just download everything they could off usenet and throw 'em on a CD and hope no one noticed?  6,000 .wad files is a lot of files... a lot of people to contact and get permission from.  Were the authors compensated in any way?"
Doom,3bfz8r,holemilk,0,Sun Jun 28 22:00:53 2015 UTC,These maps were all public domain since they could be downloaded at no cost.  The authors did not receive compensation.

If you don't mind playing with others, just join any server (as long as both of you join the same one) and you should be good to go. If you want a private match, from Doomseeker's top menu look for ""Create Game"" and it should open the server creation menu. Just toy around with the settings, be sure to check the Flags tab for a more customized game, and if you want you can set it to private or just limit the number of players to two. I have never done this myself, so I'm sorry I can't give you any more tips. Have fun!"
Doom,3bg9av,david_nvf,8,Sun Jun 28 23:25:33 2015 UTC,"The original Doom had a simple plot where scientists accidentally open a portal to hell, demons come out and kill everyone, then you fight them and enter hell to kill the big badass. It was cool and it worked well enough.  Then Half-Life 1 came along. It used a very similar plot, but added massive improvements in storytelling:   You are at ground zero when the portal experiment misfires and the invasion starts You hope for the soldiers' arrival, then you're horrified when they start killing everyone in a cover-up You uncover evidence of past portal experiments (""questionable ethics"") You see the military lose the conflict with the creatures You go through the portal on a suicide mission, to kill the creature holding the portal open   And then we had almost two decades of FPS games trying to improve on that.  How do we make a good story for a Doom reboot? Tricky question. It's not as easy as just going back to the basics, because other people have already examined the basics, learned the lessons and improved on them in many ways."
Doom,3bg9av,want_to_want,2,Mon Jun 29 11:18:48 2015 UTC,Maybe the demons will kidnap doom - guy's bunny again...
Doom,3bg9av,Mr_Baux,6,Mon Jun 29 00:14:53 2015 UTC,"""You have been activated"" sounds more like ""you've been sent to do this thing"", but a more military/professional sounding way. You do play as a marine, after all.   Maybe it'll have a Bioshock style plot twist   pls no. Not every story needs to have a fucking twist."
Doom,3bg9av,AhrmiintheUnseen,2,Sun Jun 28 23:58:22 2015 UTC,"I agree, a plot twist would be a bit dumb for a Doom game, and would probably be too predictable anyway."
Doom,3bg9av,Littleman88,2,Mon Jun 29 06:30:39 2015 UTC,"Like what?  DOOM guy IS the demon of demons?   The way he's ripping off jaws and punching through chest cavities all while annihilating an army straight from hell suggests as much.   He only eats souls for lunch to get a massive health boost and is eerily resistant to becoming a zombie where everyone else succumbed.  But him just being 217% bad ass works too.  TL;DR:  I don't think there's a plot twist that could do DOOM justice.  It would inevitably be eye-roll worthy.  There might be some suggestion of a story, but even ID has to know we're just here to shoot uglies.  A lot of uglies."

Doom,3bg9av,haunebu_wolf,3,Mon Jun 29 03:05:13 2015 UTC,"I just want the demons to be actual demons, not some experiments gone wrong. And I have a strange feeling they took experiment route..."
Doom,3bg9av,Scissorman1985,4,Mon Jun 29 07:29:38 2015 UTC,"Why not both? They open a gate to Hell and try to control and weaponize what comes through. Their attempts fail and Hell gets a new breed of cyborg/demon fusions. Just like the original. As long as the premise remains akin to the original, then the professional sci-fi novelist they hired to write Doom 4 can do whatever the hell he wants as long as he doesn't add gooey melodrama or a contrived plot twist."
Doom,3bg9av,want_to_want,3,Mon Jun 29 19:53:40 2015 UTC,"Thematically it would be cool if it were both ways. Humans trying to weaponize demon magic and demons trying to weaponize human tech. First you'd see imps playing like children with automatic weapons, then more serious demons becoming demon/transformer hybrids with tons of tiny intricate parts. And similar developments on the human side of the conflict, with the player learning some demon magics."
Doom,3bg9av,Scissorman1985,2,Tue Jun 30 08:56:37 2015 UTC,That would explain how the player is able to transform into a Revenant as shown in the multiplayer demo. I'm sorta hoping that applies to the single-player campaign as some sort of replacement for the berserk power-up.

Doom,3bg9av,cavalierau,2,Mon Jun 29 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"Is it confirmed to be on Mars? Very old Doom 4 news said that it would roughly follow the Hell On Earth plot, but that was before they basically started over.   I'm still holding out hope that the UAC level is a UAC facility on Earth. An Earth invasion raises the stakes, gives more possibilities for colour palette, and to me makes for a more compelling story."
Doom,3bg9av,Littleman88,3,Mon Jun 29 04:04:04 2015 UTC,"The Earth setting of the old Doom 4 was hinted at by one of the producers before the whole thing was shut down. In Bethesda's conference, it was confirmed that it will take place on Mars, but I wouldn't rule out the possibility that some levels may take place on Earth. And I agree with you, we would have 3 main Doom games that take place on Mars, not to count the spin-offs. I would welcome the change of scenery."
Doom,3bg9av,captaincrunchey,2,Mon Jun 29 06:30:01 2015 UTC,"DOOM gave Mars blue skies and grassy mountains.  It's not impossible for DOOM's Mars to be a terraformed Mars, or at least one in the process of terraformation (not a word) and colonization.  Well, correction - it wasn't Mars actual, but an even more absurd setting, Mars' moon, Phobos."

Like, I don't expect any huge twists, but I think there is a lot they could do to make the plot more interesting than just ""You are a marine, go to Mars and kill demons and shit."""
Doom,3bg9av,Niemand7,2,Mon Jun 29 06:21:19 2015 UTC,"i think it's because a lot of people currently into Doom grew up with the notion that it's ""not supposed"" to have a plot, and that including any sort of narrative at all is somehow blasphemous to Doom. they like to point out that Doom 3 (usually considered the least-Doomy Doom) had the most involved plot while also ignoring that like 90% it was totally ignorable by the player if you want."
Doom,3bg9av,Littleman88,3,Tue Jun 30 04:31:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it is kind of silly that people would be so adamantly opposed to the idea of including a plot in Doom. As long as it doesn't distract from the game, it should be fine."
Doom,3bg9av,Niemand7,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:53:32 2015 UTC,"The plot will have to minimize taking control away from the player and keep anything that dials back the action to short spurts, like that hologram leading the player to a dead dude with a red key card next to him (anyone else notice that card?)  Think more Portal's approach to storytelling.    We'll probably get history on what went wrong, advertisements for the UAC, scientific journals, etc, but I don't expect many if any actual cut scenes outside of dawning our helmet and weapon pick ups."
Doom,3bg9av,want_to_want,2,Mon Jun 29 20:03:54 2015 UTC,"I actually think that would be a great idea, If the entire story was about what happened at the base, and was told through that holographic drone. That way, the player could entirely skip the story if they wanted to to keep them in the rush of the game. Like you could still follow around a group of characters, but without taking control away from the player. I am thinking like Half Life 2 cutscenes.  The only real thing I want is maybe some insight to Doomguy. Might be challenging with him being a silent protagonist. I had an idea that the opening cutscene could be a flashback to Doomguy knocking out his CO for ordering him to fire on civilians (referencing the story in the old game manual). You could tell that story with little to no dialogue and it would still work."
Doom,3bg9av,Niemand7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"I had an idea that the opening cutscene could be a flashback to Doomguy knocking out his CO for ordering him to fire on civilians   In a more story-based shooter, I would vote for making it part of the game instead.  The story practically writes itself. Demons attack the Mars facility and civilian scientists are fleeing in panic. You are part of the military team sent to deal with the threat. Then your squad is ordered to kill the scientists as part of a cover-up, like in Half-Life. If you comply, your superiors finish the cleanup by killing you. So the only way to survive is to disobey orders.  It would be especially cool if there were many opportunities to disobey, up till the point where you've already killed the scientists, reached the extraction point, and the dropship starts firing at you. It would be kinda like the incinerator scene in Portal or an inversion of the ""No Russian"" scene in MW2. The player would need to literally ignore the game's chatter and objective markers, and instead start looking around for organic nooks and crannies, in order to go AWOL or attack their own squad. (If you just go AWOL, the game goes on but your squad still kills the scientists, so it's a difficult choice either way.)  Once that battle is over, the player character would take off their helmet, with all its remote cameras and objective markers, and stomp it into the ground. Then cock the shotgun, cue heavy metal music, and fade to the DOOM logo. The prologue is over and it's not a military shooter anymore."

Doom,3bcqyp,phipb,8,Sun Jun 28 15:14:12 2015 UTC,"Add Painkiller to that.  From 90s, Sin was good. Half-Life is also quite good (Duh), especially Opposing Force.   There aren't many ""old school"" shooters out there. Even the 'modern' ones like new Shadow Warrior and Hard Reset are pushing the definition of it. Though Serious Sam is still true to it's roots.  Modern shooters? Bulletstorm was quite enjoyable. It was nearly on rails shooter but the skillshot system was really fun (but yeah it did suffer from limited amount of guns on hand).  Another one that was arcadey was Gunslinger: Call of Juarez. It might not be like the others but action was pretty much constant, it had charm and gunplay was rather solid and satisfying.   Bioshock games are also fun to play. All three of them, second one may not have the stellar narrative but the gunplay and that drill are worth playing for.  I am also a big fan of the STALKER games. Certainly not old school, but those games are just a blast.  Not first person, but Max Payne is always a blast to go back to.  These are just some of the top of my head."

Doom,3bcqyp,phipb,0,Sun Jun 28 12:28:20 2015 UTC,Painkiller H&D is really good.
Doom,3bcqyp,General_101,3,Sun Jun 28 15:14:39 2015 UTC,No it is not! To this day the game is plagued by bugs and many other issues. Their latest patch broke the game more than actually helped it. If you exited the menus a certain way the game would lock up and display say the main menu and the LAN screen on top of each other. Most of the actual game is locked behind DLC. Meaning if you want to see the entirety of Painkiller in HD then you are going to have to cough up a lot more money. The community is pretty much non-existent and to add insult to injury the game gets progressively worse looking as you keep nearing the end. Some levels almost look like they were direct rips from the first game. Anyone who is interested in Painkiller these days should just get Painkiller: Black Edition and ignore Painkiller: HD
Doom,3bcqyp,HowardTJMoon,3,Sun Jun 28 21:18:25 2015 UTC,"What this guy said. HD is the worst possible way to enjoy the original Painkiller. Awful design choices and it just doesn't play right. Stick to Black Edition, it's better and cheaper and still holds up"
Doom,3bcqyp,phipb,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:28:18 2015 UTC,"I only played the singleplayer. Not sure if we're even playing the same game but everything in that game was very well done. I didn't run into any technical problems too. What exactly are these ""design choices"" you're talking about? I mean I know the community is pretty much non-existent. For a competitive game. Of course it's dead. The singleplayer is the part that's really good IMO. I even played a bit of multiplayer and liked it. I haven't made it to the end yet though. Also there's more than enough content in the singleplayer that I've played. Got it on sale and would say it was worth it. edit: for the record not saying Black Edition is worse. Just thought HD is completely fine."
Doom,3bcqyp,HowardTJMoon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:43:17 2015 UTC,"I've played the shit out of BE and HD compared to BE made some odd choices (i only ever played SP as well.) Little niggles like enemies appearing that don't fit the time period the map evokes, for example. The cool secrets of the original were severely dumbed down, and the fact that the majority of the maps (the 'good ones' in my mind) were locked out for overpriced DLC. Not to mention the homebrew maps they packed with these were atrocious.   It looked good but above all it just didn't feel like painkiller. I had a similar issue with the ROTT remake. It was probably me expecting too much from the game but it felt pointless when BE still looks and plays fantastic."
Doom,3bcqyp,phipb,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:02:27 2015 UTC,"As I said to the other guy, I didn't run into a single bug in the 3 hours I've played the campaign and I don't see the problem in DLC when the campaign is fairly long to begin with. Multiplayer community might be dead but that's to be expected. You're making it sound much worse than it is honestly. Wouldn't argue that BE is better tho just saying.."
Doom,3bcqyp,General_101,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:48:01 2015 UTC,"If you think that the campaign for HD is long then you have no idea of the amount of lost content that was in Black Edition. You may have not had any issues but I certainly did and so did my brother when we were playing together. We have very different hardware so it isn't tied to brand and these issues continued even after the update. No, I am not making it sound worse than it is. Painkiller: HD only bonus is graphics while taking away a huge chunk of content present in Black Edition. Black Edition is superior in every aspect except for modding and graphical fidelity."
Doom,3bcqyp,phipb,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:39:13 2015 UTC,"Considering that it did probably cost a lot of money to make, voice over work, new animations, etc, which means that less (good*) content is still perfectly reasonable considering also just how much there is, contrary to what you said, it's a really good game. The developers needed more money for the bonus content? I'm willing to support that.  Honestly I had a lot of fun in HD and I'm not sure how similar it is to BE exactly but I suggest to buy either one on sale."

Personal Favorites:  Unholy Realms (Classic design, FANTASTIC Hell levels)  Going Down (The most clusterfucky, chaotic,waves and waves monsters campaign I've seen. Made by Cyriak)  Pirates! (Pirate doom!)  Reelism (Very original wave-survival game. Has an absurd amount of random enemies, weapons, and powerups)  Stronghold - On the Edge (Professionally made wave survival with a hub area where you buy upgrades and items in between levels)  Epic2 (Ancient-egyptian temple campaign. Has a great atmosphere, frequent creative traps and sparse ammo really give you the feeling of exploring a dangerous dungeon. A rare example of maps where sometimes its wiser to run from some fights)  Cold as Hell (A survival-horror in an arctic setting. Slow, magazine-based reloading and needing to find safe places to use medkits makes for some desperate situations. Kind of a hit-or-miss with people, if nothing else it's unique)  Hell Ground (Hard as balls, absolutely terrifying, some of the most surreal mapping I've seen. Really beautiful  Sythe 2 (Short, hard maps. A classic)  EDIT:  Just as an aside, remember that with a few exceptions, no maps are made to be played with jumping or crouching; using them will break the levels."
Doom,3bdu6l,Ta0Ta,2,Mon Jun 29 00:28:00 2015 UTC,This response is pretty much perfect. Thanks for all of the suggestions :D
Doom,3bb15k,Hofmann83,9,Sat Jun 27 14:31:06 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/DISV44x.jpg (You can clearly see the horns in this one)  http://i.imgur.com/lX3kenH.jpg (You can clearly see the hoof in this one, so goat legs confirmed)  http://i.imgur.com/l50stcF.jpg (I think this is the best frame)  http://i.imgur.com/PAhMeqT.jpg (I think there are some Cacodemon tentacles and a hand on the top of this one)  What i also noticed is that the player is fighting at least 8 enemies at once, a Baron, two Knights, two Imps, two Pinkies, and potentially a Cacodemon, which is nice. And i think one of the Knights is fighting the Baron."
Doom,3bb15k,xblood_raven,4,Sat Jun 27 14:54:08 2015 UTC,"Great work! In terms of what I noticed. The Hell Knight reaches the Baron of Hell's chest so this creature is about 10 foot tall at least. There is a split between it's neck and chest which seems to be a crest of some sort as it extends to the back of it's neck in where both ends of this crest stop. It's colour is a darker red (I prefer this) instead of the pink but it does have classic horns pointing downwards.   It has red all over (instead of different colours on the chest and legs) and it's hooves are cloven with the classic bipedal legs (all the demons seem to have this look which does suggest an connection between the demons). It's pelvis is really bony and is very visible when looking at the Baron of Hell. Another very interesting point is that if you look a little bit below the crest I was talking about; you will see orange glows which seem to be demonic runes from what I can see.  The other interesting point is that the Baron of Hell is having a enemy infight with the Hell Knight and hits it with it's left fist (it's face seems to turn to a smile as it hits it. Also it could be grabbing the Hell Knight, not hitting it) putting the Hell Knight to it's knees and then proceeds to roar at it (or bite it's face and/or face off) before moving on to attack the player.  Lastly the Baron of Hell looks like the statue and the face seems to be like the classic with the dog face and white teeth."

Doom,3bb15k,captaincrunchey,2,Sun Jun 28 20:25:00 2015 UTC,I kinda like the new demon designs. The biggest and baddest demons have large horns so you can tell right away what the most important target is.
Doom,3bb15k,darkjesusfish,4,Sun Jun 28 00:26:44 2015 UTC,"I like that they managed to merge the doom 1&2 look with the doom 3 look. the Pinky, Caco and (from what little we see) the baron are strait up old school. the zombies and hell knights are 3. the imp and mancubus are a mix of both worlds.

Doom,3baiix,Gocatters1702,8,Sat Jun 27 09:57:12 2015 UTC,"In an age of unnecessary censorship and ridiculous stretches to make every piece of media as politically correct as possible, DOOM is something that the gaming industry needs – a large-scale, triple-A title that isn’t afraid to soak its hands in some excessively detailed demon’s blood.   Dude... I mean... Perhaps he didn't know about Doom, but did this guy ever played Bulletstorm? Or Shadow Warrior? Or Ninja Gaiden, Mortal Kombat, God of War and almost any game since the first Doom came out? This is the statement of a 15 year old who never played any violent game and speaks as there weren't any of them, ever."
Doom,3baiix,GillesDelacroix,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"Looks like a genY game reviewer, expect to see more of these.  I think Shadow Warrior is as close as we're going to get to an old school shooter being replicated on a modern day engine. It's not perfect, but it's one of the very few shooters I've actually been able to complete from start to finish, and still wanted more.  There's a lot of hype on Doom 4, but I can't help but feel they went in the wrong direction with some of their design choices. But eh, we won't know until the release."
Doom,3baiix,kiros_winstone,9,Sun Jun 28 03:53:16 2015 UTC,This guy is way too impressed by things that were introduced to shooters literally a decade ago.
Doom,3baiix,KingKane,2,Sat Jun 27 14:24:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wanna see less gore and more varied design styles within the same level.  I think they have the right amount of arcade-style action."
Doom,3baiix,KevvyLava,4,Sat Jun 27 14:26:00 2015 UTC,"I'm just not into some of these new trends in shooters like ""fatalities."" They're a cool little perk but they don't make a shooter good. It's too easy for developers to rely on these bells and whistles to cover up the fact that their game just isn't that fun."
Doom,3baiix,KingKane,2,Sat Jun 27 15:28:29 2015 UTC,"Right.  I also don't like the ""overly detailed Martian space station"" thing that is just like Doom 3.  You know, sparks flying around, panels missing, dark corridors, etc.  The original Doom didn't really get creepy until the second episode.  I do like how they made Doomguy move fast and smooth, like in the original.  Some of my favorite levels in Doom 1/2 are ones that are ""just levels"", not supposed to actually be anything specific.  e1m1, e1m4, e1m5, e2m1, e2m2, e3m6, e4m1, e4m2, e4m4, e4m6, etc."
Doom,3baiix,KevvyLava,3,Sat Jun 27 16:16:01 2015 UTC,"I was right with you until your last statement.  Almost all of those levels have names of what they're supposed to be.  E1M1, for example, is supposed to be a Hangar (the level is even called ""The Hangar"").  It wasn't really until DooM 2 (and, technically Ultimate Doom) that the levels started to just be whatever and had names like ""Dead Simple"" and ""Tricks and Traps"".  All the original Doom levels were supposed to be based on locations on the Phobos station that led to the gateway to hell."
Doom,3baiix,dpkonofa,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:05:24 2015 UTC,"They have names and they're supposed to be stuff kind of, but you'd never know without the name."
Doom,3baiix,KevvyLava,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:12:12 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that was more of a technical limit than a matter of intent.  The intended for them to follow the story line.  If you read the DooM Bible, you'll see that they cut down the cues in favor of the gameplay."
Doom,3baiix,dpkonofa,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:51:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was a technical limit.  They could have gone with different textures and more specific level design.  It was just ""good enough"".  It's not like ""Hangar"" looks like a hangar."
Doom,3baiix,KevvyLava,2,Sun Jun 28 23:19:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah the design doesn't seem like doom to me. Doom was all about Brutalism in its spaces. Lots of concrete slabs and flat surfaces. Of course this was due to hardware limitations, but it created an atmosphere that the new games have failed to represent."
Doom,3baiix,KingKane,2,Sat Jun 27 16:21:35 2015 UTC,Exactly.  Brutal Doom did it right where a fatality was rare like once or twice a level.  That's a neat little bonus.  But in the new doom it's constant.  It ruins the flow of the combat which is what DOOM is all about and even what they were saying they wanted to capture.
Doom,3baiix,Amerikaner,5,Sat Jun 27 16:43:00 2015 UTC,I guess we have to accept that Doom came out almost 25 years ago and the people who actually played it are a very small portion of who Doom 4 hopes to sell to.
Doom,3baiix,KingKane,4,Sat Jun 27 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"I think that's a stretch.  Any pc gamer in their late 20s onward probably played DOOM.  Besides, a good game is a good game no matter what. DOOM isn't still super popular on nostalgia alone."
Doom,3baiix,Amerikaner,3,Sat Jun 27 17:08:42 2015 UTC,It's like these people haven't played the new Shadow Warrior.
Doom,3baiix,Stinkfished,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:32:58 2015 UTC,As a newer doom player that started with doom 1 and 2 on xbox live when they came out. i do like the direction but at the same time its just not exactly what i started playing. the fatalities are cool and all but as someone said in the comments there to common and if they where not so common it be a lot better imo. On a random note i just downloaded all the extra dooms on steam and my god the creativity people have i truly respect on the doom engine.

Doom,3b7ad1,SwnSng,2,Fri Jun 26 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"The reason the placeholder date was Dec 31, 2015 was because it was an expected 2016 release but since Bethesda has now said Spring 2016...May 31 would now be the logical choice for a placeholder date. IOW it could come sooner..."

The honest truth is that even the developers don't know when the game will actually be released until their game gets through certification with the platform holders and gets approved for replication. All it takes is failing cert on something really dumb and you might have to resubmit... or if you don't have too many huge issues, you'll get approved for replication on the condition of a day one patch that fixes the most important of those issues."

Doom,3b7gdn,Scissorman1985,5,Fri Jun 26 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"I've watched the trailer and the demo many times and the level design is definitely more open than what was shown. In the trailer, Doomguy jumps over a railing and combats demons on a ground level floor that wasn't explored in the demo. There's no way they would enable mantling and the double jump if the levels weren't big enough to accommodate and justify the player's abilities. At least I hope so."

Doom,3b7gdn,Littleman88,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:33:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, so it definitely has some non-linearity. At the very least we can expect the game to be less linear than modern games. The whole section of the level seems to have a nice, circular and multi-layered feel to it."
Doom,3b6bma,TeregrinPook,13,Fri Jun 26 09:23:58 2015 UTC,"The fuckin wheel is in the way, fixed it:  http://imgur.com/Pq31Vyb  I like it how they fixed the Hell Knight redundancy from old Doom, making the Knights precisely in between Imps and Barons when looking at enemy size as well as their strength. In the original Doom Barons and Knights were too similar in size, design and strength. Here, Knights are like bigger and stronger Imps without fireballs, and i hope that Barons are bigger and stronger Knights with horns that throw fireballs."
Doom,3b6bma,Hofmann83,3,Fri Jun 26 12:13:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm just so excited to see the baron again... I really hope they make the Baron horned as well.  How weird that I have so much nostalgia for something that literally gave me nightmares as a kid."
Doom,3b6bma,loudbears,6,Fri Jun 26 16:51:51 2015 UTC,If you guys want to see a direct feed 60fps version of the trailer you can get it from here: http://www.gamersyde.com/news_doom_e3_trailer_is_here-16786_en.html  It definitely looks like the Baron has his horns!
Doom,3b6bma,FortofTwo,3,Fri Jun 26 18:36:40 2015 UTC,Nice! Best quality so far.
Doom,3b6bma,Hofmann83,3,Fri Jun 26 18:54:59 2015 UTC,You can see a really blurry image of the baron at 54 seconds on the trailer
Doom,3b6bma,techiesbesthero,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:24:04 2015 UTC,Holy crap I totally missed that! Baron looks freakin' menacing watching it in slow motion.  Thanks a ton for pointing that out! :D
Doom,3b6bma,loudbears,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:29:46 2015 UTC,Awesome! The silhouette instantly reminded me of the original games.
Doom,3b6bma,steelblade66,6,Sat Jun 27 23:04:49 2015 UTC,"Looking at that screenshot, I get the feeling an SMG will stand in for the pistol this time around.  Another Brutal DOOM influence I bet.  It's a low quality screenshot with tons of artifacting otherwise, with intense depth of field effect at play on top of that, even on the Hell Knight.  Though, the DoF only really applies with the weapon wheel active watching the videos."
Doom,3b6bma,Littleman88,3,Fri Jun 26 14:36:25 2015 UTC,God damnit I'm eager to see the new Arch Vile. Hopefully they'll be even creepier in the new DooM.
Doom,3b6bma,Harha,6,Fri Jun 26 10:51:38 2015 UTC,"I like the fact that bringing up the weapon selection wheel slows the game down. Gives you the opportunity to admire the monsters and textures, maybe plan your next move."
Doom,3b6bma,therightclique,7,Fri Jun 26 09:26:35 2015 UTC,That is exactly what Doom should not be. Doom should be about quick decisions and panic.
Doom,3b6bma,darkjesusfish,0,Fri Jun 26 21:13:20 2015 UTC,doom should be about aggressive killing of demons. As a console fps player I can tell you that without the slow down it would just encourage running to hide every time you need to switch a weapon because the fucking stick fucking flicks a little every fucking time you think you got a weapon and all of a sudden the fucking plasma rifle you selected is a fucking rocket launcher. this is not a problem you have with doom 1&2 while using the keyboard. I doubt pc users will need any time slowdown.

Doom,3b6bma,ChrisOfAllTrades,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:13:46 2015 UTC,There's a pretty exaggerated depth of field effect so you won't be admiring anything other than which weapon you should use to remove the demonflesh from the face in front of you.

Doom,3b6bma,Niemand7,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:54:48 2015 UTC,So what are the two new weapons going to be? Looks like some kind of SMG in the top left above the chainsaw. Rail gun below it?
Doom,3b6bma,Scissorman1985,2,Fri Jun 26 23:07:28 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that SMG is actually the chaingun. The icon is too small.
Doom,3b6bma,Littleman88,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:11:28 2015 UTC,"I would think if the icon is small, that would make it an SMG.  But reviewing the hell portion of the campaign video, it is indeed the chaingun."
Doom,3b6bma,captaincrunchey,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:24:27 2015 UTC,One of them will be a heavy machine gun with at least one attachment. Nice to have something in between the shotgun and chaingun.
Doom,3b6bma,Niemand7,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:00:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. It always felt weird to me that the original Doom didn't have any kind of assault rifle weapon, especially since the Doom marine sprite is wielding one."

Doom,3b81yr,c_t_f,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:23:27 2015 UTC,"The versions used in the videos are using different chipsets.  Old DOS computers had different ways of playing music, using a variety of sound chips that could be put (or were already) inside of them.  I.E., here's a video with Duke Nukem 3D's theme using different chipsets, just to get a general idea of how many there are and what they sound like.  That unfortunately means that if you wanted to listen to the original, non-emulated version of that song you'd have to go onto ePay and buy a DOS computer with the desired sound card. If I remember correctly there are ways to emulate it, but I don't know how, besides running the game in DOSBox and letting it run in the background while you listen to the music."
Doom,3b81yr,ON3i11,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:12:07 2015 UTC,If you really want to listen to the song you are going to want to download a software midi synthesizer like TiMiDity++ or Fluidsynth and the correct soundfont file. Find out what kind of midi device the soundtrack (or specifically the song) was composed with and download the appropriate  soundfont file for emulating that device if you want it to sound like it did when being composed. Alternatively you can download a soundfont file for emulating a midi device used for sound playback on an old computer if you want it to sound like it would to a consumer.

Doom,3b5urk,De-M-oN,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:56:02 2015 UTC,Slade is a good wad/pk3 editor. But for level editing I would rather recommend GZDoom Builder (based on Doom Builder 2)  Slade had some trouble handling my 800 MB music file though. It crashed everytime I tried to replace/add a song.  That didnt happen with XWE.

Dont worry, ive decided to move on to modding C&C. just ban me.   Your wish is my command, sir.

All the secrecy Bethesda and id were maintaining during all this time didn't contribute to make me feel comfortable with it (a closed demo in a QuakeCon nobody outside the hall would ever see? Come on...). And finally the resignation of John Carmack, which added technical doubts to my initial creative ones. All in all, I didn't give a penny for this game.  Boy, am I glad they changed my mind with those gameplay videos at E3. Now I'm really impressed with everything it's been shown and almost throwing money at the screen."

Then at E3 gameplay came out and it shut a lot of those gripers up! Since we are not excpecting DOOM until Spring 16, I think there are things that can change and there is plenty we have not seen.

It's been so long without good Doom or Quake games though, long enough that if the game manages to suck we really aren't losing anything; the classics will remain classics and Doom will just die (like it had been since Doom 3 really)."
Doom,3b1sjb,8bitterness,2,Thu Jun 25 16:36:13 2015 UTC,I'm really hoping the multiplayer will be something that lasts. I have a feeling it could with snapmap etc. Really looking forward to this game.
Doom,3b1sjb,badxreligion,2,Thu Jun 25 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"I think it looks great! The more I watch the more old doom references I see; the door opening up revealing a mancubus, pools of blood, satanic symbols on the ground, fast game play, shotgun acting as your primary weapon. I am very very excited for this game."
Doom,3b1sjb,pugdawgg,2,Thu Jun 25 18:19:44 2015 UTC,"Doom is my 2nd favorite game of all time; I play it every damn day and never get bored with it. With that in mind, I think the new game looks awesome. My only real concern is the level design. In the demo, lots of alternate paths and open corridors were apparent, even though the guy playing it obviously only took one route. Now, the game can have all the awesome weapons, gore, and demons it wants but if the level design doesn't keep more than ample room open for exploration and combat then this is only Doom on the surface. If it does, then all will be well in a Doomed universe."
Doom,3b1sjb,Scissorman1985,2,Thu Jun 25 18:23:44 2015 UTC,"Gotta highlight that the thread is about the positive of the game, I tried creating a thread before but it had to die due to haters.  You know that the developers have to be careful to retread old grounds, which they are going back to the roots of Doom 1 and 2.  My only concern is snapmap won't be as versatile as they are making it out to be, but with what we've seen you can definitely make something somewhat to what you are envisioning. With what I saw of it, I know I will definitely spend countless hours on it even if it is restrictive in creativity.  My other worry is that some of the enemies from the original games won't make a return. They obviously gotta hold back on some of the enemies when still in development, but I hope we get to see the likes of the Lost Souls, Arachnotron, Spider Demon, Arch-vile, and others.  I do feel that this game will bring the oldschool Doom we know and love and bring it to the newer gaming era. Definitely will be a better ""Doom"" experience than 3, no doubt."
Doom,3b1sjb,LossOfSanity,2,Sat Jun 27 07:41:17 2015 UTC,We need more doom 1 and doom 2 and less of doom 3
Doom,3b1sjb,aloha22,2,Thu Jun 25 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"The game is fine I guess, but I'll have to wait until its release to really form an opinion.  I think most of the criticism it's getting is because people have been fantasizing about how a modern take on the old, classic Doom games would be for ages, so a lot of different expectations were and are floating around"
Doom,3b1sjb,JustGabriel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:47:32 2015 UTC,I just want to try it for myself.
Doom,3b1sjb,Pookaball,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:35:12 2015 UTC,"While I think the game could still use a little tweaking on coloring (Cacodemons should be red, this is mandatory) and making guns sound more powerful, I'm still hugely pleased with what I have seen from the game.   Obviously the initial demo was pared down a bit to make it less intimidating to the console dudebros, but the snippet of multiplayer gameplay gives me flashbacks of Quake 3. Powerups, strafing and bunny-hopping- it's so good to see you all again.   Snapmap looks wonderful; I'm a little concerned that id will not put as much effort into the singleplayer because of it, expecting fans to make their own content, but I'm already enthralled with the interface. I've drawn up ideas for my first few maps already.   A few have voiced complaints about the new soundtrack direction, but I don't mind it. We've heard barely any of it, plus it's being helmed by Mick Gordon, the guy behind the new Wolfenstein games' fantastic soundtracks. They prove his ability to make crushingly heavy metal when it's being called for.  All in all I'm quite happy with the new Doom. It's not exactly like Doom 2, and I wouldn't want it to be. There are more wads than I could ever reasonably play through already. What matters is that it feels like Doom should. I bet we'll see a lot more come QuakeCon this year."

Sure there's a few thing thats Doom purists hate (Hell should be more red dammit), but time has moved on. But this new Doom just feels like the Doom I imagined while playing the old games.  The carnage!!! I mean you're fighting the armies of hell so Doom  should be as evil, brutal and as blood soaked as possible (when I got to close to Revanents in Doom 2 and got punched I knew they were nasty bastards and new Doom shows them to be just that)   I'm 37 and don't have much time for games anymore but I'll be buying this!  I just hope it isn't shit like Doom 3."

I'll be hyped and excited too.  I really, really, really, REALLY hope the things I didn't like in the trailer gets a serious overhaul before launch day."

Doom,3b1sjb,zzzornbringer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:23:02 2015 UTC,"no, there are more bad things about rage. it uses many modern game mechanics like aiming down sights, regenerating health, cover shooting... not to mention the ending which was inexcusably terrible.  here's a video that reflects my thoughts about it pretty well. it's a two parter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVFrAsxjxLs"

Doom,3b2kao,Gothic_Banana,6,Thu Jun 25 14:27:55 2015 UTC,"All the positive remarks on this level I've seen refer to the aesthetics and architecture but I haven't seen anything pertaining to the playability of the level, which to me seems very poor and un-fun. For me a good Doom level just flows, and this level is like the anti-flow."
Doom,3b2kao,pereza0,2,Thu Jun 25 14:50:02 2015 UTC,"I thought it was pretty good, I played it for the first time this week. Especially compared to the map that preceeds it (Downtown, I hate it with passion).  I felt it escalated nicely, it wasn't too strechted out, secrets were placed in logical places if you paid attention... It doesnt constantly pull ambushes and that sort of shit.  This map has good flow as long as you are paying attention. I also didnt know how to get to the last blue door, but I knew what the only area I hadn't visited was and kept track if it. It was just a matter of getting there. Checking the minimap made it easy enough"

Doom,3b2zj9,SwnSng,3,Thu Jun 25 21:06:40 2015 UTC,"I figure if they can get DOOM 3 to run on VR devices, they can get DOOM 4 to run on VR devices.  I sincerely doubt a game needs to be built from the ground up to work with VR.  Not the first time I've heard a developer state something entirely possible isn't at all good for game play for an absurd  reason.  Now, motion sickness from a game not built form the ground up to consider VR?  I can get that.  That still shouldn't be a reason NOT to include VR - just a caveat to keep a barf bag nearby."

Doom,3b279i,Half-Jaw,3,Thu Jun 25 12:25:18 2015 UTC,"When speaking about the enemies, I only partially agree. I do agree that the Imps need to be able to be more easily distinguished from the Zombies BUT I think The Revenant and The Cacodemon surpass even the originals. The Mancubus, Hell Knight and Pinky are great too.  Doom 64 had filters as well and it worked just fine."
Doom,3b279i,therightclique,3,Thu Jun 25 12:24:16 2015 UTC,Doom 64 had filters as well   This. Here are examples from wikipedia and the Doom Wikia.  Doom 4 doesn't seem so bad now.

Doom,3b279i,pereza0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:53:32 2015 UTC,It was not a cash-in at all. It was the most matured version of Doom and had the best atmosphere. Many (such as myself) consider it to be the best Doom.
Doom,3b279i,Plastic_Indian,3,Fri Jun 26 06:49:03 2015 UTC,"There's a difference here. Doom and Doom II might have had some brown textures, but it didn't have a yellowish brown filter applied to EVERYTHING. It honestly bothers me much like how every damned movie seems to have that stupid blue filter applied to everything. It just looks bad to me. Also, Doom and Doom II had enemies that ran a broad spectrum. From bright red, blue, green, black, and PINK...   Honestly though, the ENVIRONMENTS aren't what I personally have a problem with, it's the bland enemies. A bunch of washed out drab brown monsters just looks boring. Obviously from the doctored screengrabs of the Cacos, it shows that they could add quite a bit of color and still look pretty good.  Again, as I always say - I am holding judgement until the game is released. We'll see what the final product is next year sometime maybe."
Doom,3b279i,saegiru,2,Thu Jun 25 12:08:33 2015 UTC,"Expanding on the bland enemies, I have a problem with bloodthirsty DEMONS from HELL that politely hang back and wait their turn while you freeze in place to do finishers/extended chainsaw animation on one enemy at a time; might as well have them pull out tea and crumpets while they wait. What is this, a turn-based RPG?"
Doom,3b279i,saegiru,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:18:07 2015 UTC,I dont think this is the case. In the demo the chainsaw kills were never performed in the presence of other enemies.  It would be very dumb to be able to chain kills like that

Doom,3b279i,TheBeardofGilgamesh,3,Thu Jun 25 22:26:18 2015 UTC,Why is it awful? It's a foundry with lots of molten metal. Makes sense to me and it looks good to me.

Doom,3b279i,Neon_Ronin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:50:21 2015 UTC,"On one hand, I think it's neat that the enemies have colors that blend into the background (makes them harder to spot if they aren't moving and they can jump you more easily). The yellow filter...I don't want everything to be yellow, and would be OK with there being ""accent"" white or red lights here and there.    On the other, I'd love to see more colors on the monsters - not the cartoonish ones from Doom 1&2 (sorry guys, those colors look cartoonish to me - too bright and saturated), but accents that would serve as additional deterrents. The colors from Doom 1 are much too bright and saturated, IMO; whenever I got to a level with those red&black walls my eyes would hurt for minutes.    Would be neat if there were more colors in the background, too. That bright purple powerup looked nice compared to everything else. And music similar to Doom 1&2 would work nicely; right now, the world looks depressing and grim, but the fatalities are hilariously over the top. There should be something extra to tie these two together. Anyway, that's my 2 cents on Doom 4. I can't wait to play it!"

Doom,3b093s,SpehlingAirer,7,Wed Jun 24 22:46:56 2015 UTC,I love Brutal Doom as well. Its just impressive how he did the new graphics (fatalities especially) so well done. I mean: I really wonder that how he did that? The graphics arent there so he had to make the graphics of for example an imp which is with its back laying on the floor and gets punished into the face by the doomguy. The game doesnt have that - so he had to make the sprites. And I really wonder and find it impressive that it is so authentic done as if the original game has this graphics.  The only thing I dislike is the health of the marines. They're absolutely overpowered even at Black Metal. But mainly because they refuse to die.

I have to admit, though, I was a little bit underwhelmed with v20. And in the interim between finishing the games again and the release of v20, I tried the Smooth Doom mod and played through the first half of Doom 2 again and I feel a bit like I'm having a hard time getting into Brütal Doom again.  I still like it, but now it seems a bit loud and garish in comparison, and no where near the level of polish (despite all the entertaining tweaks and additions) as Smooth Doom.  Seriously, if you're looking for a lightweight enhancement mod for Doom, get Smooth Doom. The enhanced animations make it so much nicer to play."

I did play with it once with classic mode and it was alright but all the bells and whistles that came with BD were just flashy stuff that doesn't add or take away from the game IMO. All the gameplay additions also sucked major ass until very recently, having the Doomguy talk and act like a fucking retard was such a stupid idea.  Mark4's attitude could really be done without though, he's fucking toxic and narcissistic as hell. The mod is alright, all the authors of the mods he took are pretty talented as well.  This is all my opinion tho."

Doom,3b093s,MrZzul,2,Thu Jun 25 07:45:15 2015 UTC,You must be me.  I just finally installed Brutal Doom last night after having basically the same thoughts.  This is the most fun I've had gaming in awhile.
Doom,3b093s,Amerikaner,2,Fri Jun 26 20:24:41 2015 UTC,It really is simply a lot of fun. Hard too!
Doom,3b093s,JohnnyK988,2,Sat Jun 27 01:09:12 2015 UTC,"BD isn't my style, but I can definitely appreciate all the hard work these guys put into that mod. I especially like all the new animations, they're really well done. Just crazy how far they pushed the Doom engine, and (sort of) kept the Doom spirit. Again, not for me! I'm a vanilla dude."
Doom,3b093s,alkatrazjr,2,Thu Jun 25 02:05:32 2015 UTC,"give it that extra something new while not changing the core.   Not really, the way Brutal Doom is played is completely different compared to vanilla."
Doom,3b093s,guran33a,5,Wed Jun 24 23:26:48 2015 UTC,"It's different (just in a good way though, it's definitely improvements over vanilla Doom) but at the same time BD works very well on the vanilla maps.  It's one of the best singleplayer FPS experiences I've ever had, it got the right speed, feels very responsive and the weapons got the right feeling with awesome sound effects, the right amount of kick and response when you shoot enemies; it feels satisfying every time.  Sergeant Mark is a genius when it comes to putting that together, but sure BD has some weak spots. I think that the rolling and the taunts are unnecessary, just makes it feel ""cartoonish"" and lowers the quality but you don't have to use them so it's a no-problem really."
Doom,3b093s,shadesofice,2,Thu Jun 25 00:29:48 2015 UTC,The taunts are unnecessary and childish in my books.
Doom,3b093s,Littleman88,4,Thu Jun 25 18:52:25 2015 UTC,"True, but the core of what makes DooM great is still there."
Doom,3b093s,C4Cypher,4,Thu Jun 25 00:34:04 2015 UTC,"After Brutal DOOM and especially Project Brutality (The expanded version of Brutal DOOM) I can't go back to vanilla.  By comparison, vanilla is unsatisfying and slow.  Weapons just lack the oomph, and the pistol still ranks as a PoS, where as BD wants every weapon to have a place.  Project Brutality/Brutal DOOM simply improves on core game play in all the right ways.  Things like a talking marine and a roll feature I never use could have been left out, but they don't interfere with the experience either.  Reloading seems to up the intensity of game play I've found, making me a little disappointed DOOM 4 won't have reloading.  Instead, it looks like it will have a shotgun that can't hit $#!% past 3m, which I find even more disappointing.  And ADS?  It's a zoom feature exclusive to a  few guns, which I find a welcome addition because it's not necessary to ADS for said guns to function.  A fast DOOM marine DOES NOT make a game fast or intense, walking speed is enough in most cases even - enemy speeds and projectile velocities, attack rates, etc make a fast DOOM game however.  Vanilla DOOM lacked intense enemies.  I do think if the technology and game play concepts existed back in 1993 with the idea of making DOOM the arcade shooter it is now/was/whatever, DOOM would have been much different (and more violent) by default - in a good way."

I stumbled over a clip on YouTube and thought that the video was modified, because that was never ever in-game footage. New graphics, lighting/particle effects, freelook and all that stuff in a game that is that old? No way!  I loved Doom back in the days and wanted to play it again sometimes but it was banned in my country, so there was no easy way to get your hands on it. But then I saw it wasn't banned anymore and I could even buy it on Steam. Well I bought all three of them, tested Brutal Doom and I had the same reaction, it literally blew my mind. It makes Doom even better, all the fun and memories from my childhood came back.  There are many very good mods out there but for me Brutal Doom is clearly the best one, maybe because my first encounter with mods was Brutal Doom and I had no idea about how you can modify Doom, for example GZDoom I had no idea that this existed.  And for me the new DOOM looks very disappointing but I'm not even mad about that. Because I can play Brutal Doom and I have WADS for years."

It's just a generic twin stick shooter with cringeworthy dialogue, a main character nobody besides underclassmen in highschool can relate to, a poor respawn system, and it tries to redeem itself on shock value alone (which actually takes even more away from the game, like how you have to do a mini-cutscene any time you want to execute someone, the only way you can heal yourself, and you can't ensure someone will be executable).  Not only is the game's content nowhere near as provocative and obscene as the hype would suggest, it still tries to use that to carry itself."

There's little relevance to that point though - DOOM 4 borrows more from modern games with a nod towards the old ways.  To be fair, the gore was a no-brainer.

Doom,3aui8j,PsychoAgent,6,Wed Jun 24 12:25:45 2015 UTC,"Serious Sam 3 became like the CoD    What? The differences were so minute. All they did that really impacts gameplay was remove powerups such as Double Damage or invulnerability. Everything else was kept the same.  Few guns had reloads and some had aiming down sight which made hardly any impact on the overall gameplay. Secrets were there just as before, where you can find guns early. All guns were pretty much the same in terms of balance. The amount of enemies was more than ever before.  On serious difficulty final mission ran up to 2500 enemies. It really tested how you managed large encounters and which guns you prioritize and where.  The only off game in SS franchise is SS2. TSE was an improvement on TFE and BFE was phenomenal in both upping the scale as well as showing how a old school game can be made into a modern FPS without sacrificing what made the old games so good."
Doom,3aui8j,mmSNAKE,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:45:08 2015 UTC,"That's what's bad about SS3.  They never bothered to improve upon the original games which I found highly flawed.  They just improved the graphics.  The movement system still felt clunky, the pacing of the intro levels did not motivate me to keep playing, and I felt I was always scrounging for ammo and health.  Micromanaging ammo and health should not be a concern in a high octane arcadey shooter like the Serious Sam games."
Doom,3aui8j,kwahoo2,2,Wed Jun 24 14:16:46 2015 UTC,"They never bothered to improve upon the original games which I found highly flawed   Well you see, a lot of people found them to be exactly as they should.   They just improved the graphics.    And breakable cover, and secrets that are more incorporated into the environment, and upped the scale of battle. What honestly most of the audience wanted for these games.   the pacing of the intro levels did not motivate me to keep playing and I felt I was always scrounging for ammo and health   Pacing for earlier levels was I assume done for benefit of newcomers, before dropping them into hundreds (and thousands) of enemies.   Micromanaging ammo and health should not be a concern in a high octane arcadey shooter like the Serious Sam games.   Well yes it should. That is what seperates it from most of today's games. You can't just blindly go and shoot. You have to know how to engage, with what to engage. What guns for what enemy. Constantly switch. Priority targets, etc. This was the point of the very first SS game.  I completed Serious difficulty on TSE without getting hit once (though the bouncy room and the tube spinning room took several tries). Never ran out of ammo. I finished BFE on Serious and the only rationing of ammo was from Minigun or Cannon, since they are ""kill anything guns"". Sniper and Laser were strictly secret guns. So outside of secrets you wouldn't find ammo for them, or even found them. In any case I don't think I can finish the game without getting nicked, but when knowing how the game is played it isn't a concern at all.  It seems to me you wanted something else out of Serious Sam. What the game did in design it did so deliberately. With enemies that don't drop ammo or health. With secrets that give a huge leg up, with actual tactics in middle of hectic combat."
Doom,3aui8j,CharlieLove,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:22:35 2015 UTC,"They just improved the graphics. The movement system still felt clunky,   What? The movement is completely different. SS3 can be parkour 90% of time.   I felt I was always scrounging for ammo and health.   What?, the second time. There is  A LOT of ammo and health, infinite ammo crates, melee, much less ammo-hungry minigun. Most gamers start a level with 50 health points and finish it with 100 or more."
Doom,3aui8j,PsychoAgent,2,Wed Jun 24 16:17:04 2015 UTC,"I never really clicked with Serious Sam. The way you move and shoot never felt particularly great to me.

Doom,3aui8j,PsychoAgent,10,Tue Jun 23 20:42:02 2015 UTC,"I know right?  As much as I loved the freedom and openness of old school games, they were created before any conventions of good level design were established.  Some were downright confusing."
Doom,3aui8j,Littleman88,12,Tue Jun 23 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, maps in DOOM were cleverly made most of the time, often segregating regions of a map by texture and design.  The problem was simple though - most people have God awful senses of direction and can't seem to remember landmarks.  If you're honestly getting lost in a single room, you're just bad.  Multiplayer maps in any game today are built practically the same way, there's just no actual direction the player needs to move in like with a single player game.  I wouldn't call a lot of today's levels ""good"" design, so much as just so linear it's impossible to get lost, thus the birth of the term ""corridor shooter.""  Were some of DOOM's maps labyrinthine?  Absolutely.  I find these to be rarer however.  A lot of the time, it's more a matter of DOOM banking on a player's curiosity and the willingness to explore every nook and cranny for goodies and toys.  Most games only really encourage this with some odd collectable trophy 90% of the player base doesn't really give a $#!% about.  Good level design generally guides the player forward in a clever way, while offering a variety of tactical approaches to a fight.  Half-Life 2 and Halo realize these traits in having players essentially fight enemies in small isolated arenas and moving from arena to arena.  Guiding them though?  Usually done by waymarker or denying them the chance to back track.  In a game like DOOM, while not fully utilized, those little health/armor and ammo pick ups as well as key colored doors serve well as guides.  So basically, ""CoD"" generation players weren't trained on game play that encouraged them to scrounge around for supplies and identify landmarks to determine where they are, and that's why they might have trouble moving through even some of DOOM's more basic maps and having a hard time finding their sense of direction or where to go.  Regenerating health and enemies that drop ample quantities of ammunition as well as a list of guns that are negligibly different from one another all but removed the necessity of looking around as opposed to simply plowing forward.  Unfortunately, going from following subtle guides and recognizing landmarks and navigating arenas to moving down corridors and following way point markers is much easier than vice versa."
Doom,3aui8j,CharlieLove,2,Tue Jun 23 19:57:17 2015 UTC,"I was considering more the Quake 2, Half-life, and Counter-strike era to be the golden age of where level design conventions were established.  Not talking about CoD era.  And alhough I appreciate the freedom in the old school games, you should remember, even some players back then also took issue with backtracking and aimless wandering.  Sure it's fun if you know the map inside out, but I remember the second level in Syphon Filter 1 where I missed the cue and got no further direction from the game on how to proceed.  Took me a good hour of trial and error to figure out that I had to turn my flashlight on in one of the corners to find a switch that shuts off the gas so that I could extinguish a pipe flame and move through a tunnel.  Teenage me had the time and patience, but these days, I'd say fuck it, got better shit to do.  Hence the need for streamlining level design and other gameplay mechanics.  Granted game devs have taken it too far and single player games have practically become on rails experiences with the occasional cutscene thrown in.  But there can be a good middle ground.  I felt like the Half-life games did it pretty well.  Timesplitters is another honorable mention."
Doom,3aui8j,PsychoAgent,2,Tue Jun 23 21:37:19 2015 UTC,"I'll admit backtracking in DOOM for some levels was overkill.  There's one map in DOOM  E2 where I literally didn't have to visit half of it before I could complete.  So maze like is this level, I stumbled upon the secret exit by accident.  This map represents the ""open world"" conundrum: sure, you can go anywhere, but most of it isn't necessary to visit.  You just don't know where you're going.  THIS is bad game design.  Open worlds only really work for MMOs, and even then, most MMOs still treat them like on-rails levels.  Take the latest Arkham Knight.  This entire city... how much of it does one skip either via bat mobile or gliding?  But I more intended to primarily refer to the E1 layouts.  Though they also have back tracking in parts, a lot of them are roughly straight forwardly laid out with plenty of opportunities for rewarding exploration.  The fact that people can still get lost on these maps blows my mind.  Just poke around until a door opens.  There's only 2-3 tops at a time.  It makes me wonder if they even look at the terrain as opposed to just following some line or arrows on the floor or bee lining it to some glowing dot on the horizon.  Thankfully, some maintain good level design and gunplay though like Half-life, Halo, etc although they're more ""open"" corridor than actually like DOOM.  I miss looking for blemishes on walls and for the latter, scrounging around for health packs, minor power ups, armor and ammo, messing with traps like crushers, walls revealing monsters, and the like.  DOOM 4 better bring a lot of those pick ups back.  Secret rooms I think are going to be a little harder to pull off in snapmap."
Doom,3aui8j,mr_dfuse2,3,Wed Jun 24 00:11:14 2015 UTC,"A few levels in Doom 2 were especially confusing, but pretty much all of the core maps that Romero did in 1 were very carefully thought out.

Or at least using zandronum or gzdoom for some ease, like mouse look and more amount of options.  The differences in level design from older games to today's games are quite stark. If people never played games like that it isn't surprising they get slightly lost. I used to get lost when I was younger playing this until my mind learned to remember landmarks, learned to use the map and just pay attention to texture changes (for secrets and level sections).  When you play games levels that are essentially corridors with big arrows pointing where to go this can be quite a shift.  While Doom wasn't the most clever in terms of design (Something like Hexen or Blood beat it in complexity and how clever the designs were) it is still fairly iconic. It is sort of amusing when I could probably finish E1M1 or Map01(D2) with my eyes closed based solely on sound input. But I guess my childhood options and amount of games available to play were limited in comparison to folks today."

Doom,3azt5y,Gvulture,8,Wed Jun 24 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you walk as ""we"". These are your opinions and only yours.  Not to say I want a new-school Doom but when you make a thread as uninformed and pretentious as this, it's actually pretty annoying to have you think you're backed up by the whole Doom community in this.  With that out of the way, and knowing I come off as rude:  Your crosshair point is ridiculous, you realize Killing Floor has iron sights, right? The only way for a lack of crosshair to work would be with autoaim and no one needs that AT ALL in 3D environments.  The run stuff is something you should bind yourself when the game is out.  The names are the least important aspect of the difficulty, I could care less if they were called 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The challenge is what matters and not the name.  Only Nightmare involved actual ammo management (unless you're trash) and having several guns share ammo actually makes it easier. I also support shared ammo but you really went all out on that point you tried to make.  Making ammo hard to find isn't something I'd personally consider important, but whatever man.  I actually agree with no checkpoints, quicksave is all that is necessary to please everybody but I'm sure the game will have checkpoints and that's a completely fine.  If you want metal music you're probably not going to get it. Open your music player or play Killing Floor instead for this one. Not to say metal doesn't belong to Doom but it is a fucking fact that the new aim is an industrial sound and that's actually much better than metal or rock music for this type of game in my opinion (obviously my personal opinion here).  I would like the piñata stuff gone too.  Doom is not as focused on exploration as Metroid. Not even close. Keycards are simple and definitely fun. I wouldn't be mad if they're absent. There's plenty of lazy, crappy ways to implement keycards and the sole inclusion of them doesn't guarantee good level design.  And honestly I don't need to comment on the rest, those are also opinions and valid. I wouldn't expect Doom to be a dumb humor game; Serious Sam already does it.  But seriously, you're comparing Doom to games that are not even first-person shooters and then asking the devs (who owe you nothing at all) to make the game similar to fucking Final Fantasy, Fallout, and Diablo? If that's all you want, please don't buy the new Doom and just play the classics. Sure, if the developers screw this game up they will get no sympathy but it's far too late for making this kind of thread (lets me know you just found out about the game and couldn't care less about following it's development process) and you emit that ""I'm an ideas guy!"" aura that the Doom community doesn't need.  We've all great ideas and would like the game to be made specifically for us, but it won't. If you can't adapt to a new challenge (again, considering that the game doesn't suck here...) you probably shouldn't play Doom at all.  Sorry for looking rude here but for heaven's sake just fucking read the other threads in this Sub at least."
Doom,3azt5y,8bitterness,2,Wed Jun 24 21:48:31 2015 UTC,"I respect your comments but you obviously didn't read the first part of this post, I am all for adapting to change but you have to realise Bethesda said themselves this game is focusing on the core DOOM fans and my posts are what a lot of fans really want, they honestly want nothing more than 1 and 2 remade into HD and I know that doesn't sound great for a company that wants to maybe try something new but that is simply what happens when you have a old dead IP that has nothing to do with today's meta of gaming and is being brought back, a lot of people don't want modern ideas brought into it, a lot of people just want DOOM, this won't happen but you also can't tell me that the things I've suggested are ludicrous and haven't been on every DOOM fans mind.  Also the point about me comparing other games to DOOM, it's not COMPARING it's taking example of the quirky things the games of the 90s had, they all had a distinct art style and out of all the games I listed they were much more than the generic genre, DOOM was released in 1993 and Fallout/FF7 1997 I was simply making the point how this game does not need to take itself seriously to keep up, DOOM is not like other IP's it's stuck in a nostalgia time warp where new gamers don't care and old gamers adore, it doesn't need anything honestly from todays FPS games, it needs what it had and the 90's had a very different tone that should be kept intact for DOOM I feel, hard to explain but you really have to look outside of the box than simply saying ""you're labelling different games, bad point"".  Also before you comment on someone else's post about wanting DOOM to be like the originals realise what's happened with past E3, this E3 has run 80% on nostalgia with Fallout, StarFox, Halo, Final Fantasy 7, FF7 Remake alone should give you a big indication that fans are always going to be split on these sort of topics, 1 audience wants a REMAKE and others want a REMASTER. I accept change for DOOM but I feel like this last year id Software do need to add attention to detail because I feel like so far the DOOM 4 demo we got shown was lacking in areas that aren't hard to tweak for old school fans to fall in love with it as well as new comers of an old IP."
Doom,3azt5y,8bitterness,3,Wed Jun 24 23:52:59 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that what you and many others seem to be looking for is nostalgia. The 90's will never come back. There's nothing in common between the games you listed other than the decade in which they were released.  Frankly, Doom doesn't need remastering, it's already as close to perfection as it can be; it's reached it's full potential. The only way to go now is forward by implementing new gameplay mechanics.   This new game isn't a remake of Doom 1 either, it's a whole entire reboot of the franchise, you cannot expect 1:1 classic Doom here.  Making a Doom game with exactly the same gameplay and world navigation would really turn some of the game's virtues into flaws. I see no reason not to add vertical movement to the game and at the time the reason the game was 100% horizontal was because it just wasn't possible with what they had to work with.  I guess that what it comes down to is that your suggestions are weak. Several of them have been improved upon (the game is already fast and we've seen that im some Snapmap footage, there's no health regen, I'm sure you can turn the piñata stuff off, no crosshair is only fit for shooters that aim for realism in their gameplay, game will obviously come with secrets like all their fucking games do, etc.) and you're just asking for things without proposing how to fulfill your requests. With that attitude I assure you 100% you will never be satisfied with the end product.  As a note I don't understand what you meant by saying I OBVIOUSLY didn't read your post; there's nothing written up there that contradicts my statements."
Doom,3azt5y,darkjesusfish,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:26:42 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the hate for the pinata method. in a game based around killing demons do you really prefer scrounging around the level for things that make no sense being there (really? a health pack in hell?) or would you prefer killing demons for things it makes no sense for them to have. personally, in a game about killing demons I want the killing demons part to be the part that helps me kill more demons.  Im not against in level pickups, but why the fuck should that be the only/best way to get ammo/health."
Doom,3azt5y,8bitterness,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:09:27 2015 UTC,"I prefer health packs because they're just traditionally there and can be strategically placed at times and it's kinda fun.  The issue I see with the health drops is that in higher difficulties you should get killed in a few hits anyway so they won't save your life when you get swarmed and if they were to do that then they would also make the game a little too easy. I guess it's also weird that the demons just drop some magic icons for ammo and health. They could've been a little more creative with that.  Health pickups that are placed around the map are just very traditional old-school FPS elements and I think they should stay. Health drops from enemies are a little too similar to health regen and in fact they can even be a little more ""casual"" since you don't even take cover, you just keep killing stuff and healing with every kill (wcs)."

That being said I love quake too so I had lots of fun with doom 64. But even the intro to doom 64 does exactly what quake does. here is the intro and some gameplay from the original doom 64"

Doom,3arny1,SwnSng,2,Tue Jun 23 02:10:01 2015 UTC,"I would politely disagree on most of the analysis.   Game is fast   No it is not. If it has bunny hopping mechanic from like Painkiller, or double dodging from UT, that would speed it up or the sprint similar to old Doom games, as long as you can fire while sprinting, but just from the movement shown in the demo. No it is not.   The game gives just right amount of enemies at you.   Again I disagree. Hand full of enemies is hardly what I would consider ""right"". But we can simply disagree on that point.   Guns   Guns are fairly weak, shotgun takes too many shots to kill fodder enemies. It is also ineffective unless very close. It doesn't have to snipe, but 15 feet away it should be about as good as 5 feet away. Plasma gun is sad. Just sad. The only gun that has anything going for it is SSG. At least that chunks point blank. Chainsaw I have mixed feelings for. I guess it would have great use vs isolated enemies, but I doubt I would wanna use it in a shootout.    Animations are good and varied   I will agree. They are fantastic.   Executions were too much of a focus in the video. I dislike enemies giving health or ammo from it. Even if it just a chance. More tension and skillful play comes into the scene when you don't have enemies that can substitute for mistakes. In most old school shooters if you made a mistake you had to find health and ammo, not just run to the first enemy and bam iframes execution with health and ammo shower. Less risk involved.  Also what I'd like to be, is that you are not invulnerable during executions. I don't know if you are or not. But I'd like if enemies shoot the crap out of you  when you do it. and it causes you to die. That way it wouldn't make it cost effective to execute so much.  I also don't have a problem with having executions, but I'd rather make it like Serious Sam BFE. You have them, but in bigger fights (not even massive ones) if you do it, it is too much of a risk of death being hit by other things as you do it. To compensate for it you can just execute fodder enemies without weakening them, and bigger enemies once they are weakened.   Also having smash mode like brutal doom would be great to keep the flow of the combat going.  Something I'd also like to bring up that I haven't seen much around here is secrets. What I like about secrets is that you could get powerful guns earlier than intended. You had little ammo for it but it was a big help if you knew where the secret was. With the custom animation pickup for weapons I have a feeling that won't be the case, also with health and ammo showers from executions I don't see much reason to search out for secrets. Just extra armor isn't enough incentive. The new Shadow Warrior had this issue. as well.  Gore wise. It was cool but hardly the best gore game I've seen about. Killing Floor 2 might have the best gore system to date once it is complete. Soldier of Fortune 2 still as old as it is, leagues ahead of most games. Granted demo really didn't demonstrate what their gore system was fully like (unless you count scripted executions). What would be awesome if guns did dynamic damage, shoot a foot off, or shoot a part of their head off. Stuff like that, where we have full control over what sort of damage we deal to the demons.  So what is better scripted detailed gore animations, or dynamic damage that depends on player input?"

Doom,3apsx4,SwnSng,10,Mon Jun 22 14:55:50 2015 UTC,"So, is this what we have decided to complain about now?  First it was the speed of the Doom 4 demo, then it was the Music, then it was the number of enemies, and then it was the level design. Now we are complaining about the title and trying to establish what it should be called? I'm sorry, but there are some entitled people on here. Everyone on /r/doom seems to think they actually have a say in how this game is made. Believe it or not, iD is actually making a new Doom game based on their own production design which was developed by a lot of hard working people who have put a lot of love and time into this game. So, perhaps, just let them make the game? As for using 4 satanic symbols to signify the game? No. There is nothing wrong with calling it Doom 4. Just as with the 4th Led Zepplin album, everyone calls it Led Zepplin 4 (some call it Zoso). Everyone is going to call this Doom 4. Why is this complicated?"

Doom,3alzmp,SwnSng,7,Sun Jun 21 15:12:32 2015 UTC,"It's too slow!   TL;DR → It's probably faster than it looks.  You can't really make a good judgement on speed based on the E3 demos, as they tend to take their time to show off the art and environment, and exaggerate camera movements that make for nicer viewing. Even then, the snippets of PVP footage they showed off look like they're about on par with Q3A.  If you're looking for OG-Doom levels of clip, just play the originals. Now that jumping is a luxury afforded to basically every shooter since Quake, there's no need to compensate by having players capable of outrunning their own RPGs (and if you're absolutely adamant, dyed-in-the-wool stubborn on this point, and still aren't satisfied: mods).  Anyway, just think about it - they want to produce something they can show off and it's hard to show off something that moves faster than most people can keep up with. For better or worse (depending on your personal preference) games development is shifting toward games that are as fun to watch as they are to play. ""Filmic"" in ""cinematic"" are annoying buzzwords that us cynical folks are are already tired of, but gaming is a visual medium. Like it or not, sometimes people want to make things that look cool, as well as feel cool. Finding a balance is hard - but it's basically impossible if your goal is to please everybody.   There aren't enough monsters!   TL;DR → Quality over quantity.  The new AI look like they're much more competent enemies than those in the originals. It made sense to spam you with enemies back then because they were dumb as dogshit, even on the higher difficulty levels (hell, even Nightmare mode made up for it by just constantly spawning enemies).  Plus Doom never really had you being swarmed. Yes, enemy counts were kind of high, but it wasn't like Serious Sam levels of enemies. Average encounters were made up of clusters of about 4-8 enemies, with larger set-piece encounters having around 12-16 enemies every now and then (depending on difficulty level, of course).  And again, it's hard to really make a judgement on this based on the E3 footage - a good movie trailer doesn't give away the best parts of the movie; given how much work the devs have undoubtedly poured into this, I'd wager there's some pretty cool shit awaiting us when the game's finally relesed.   Ugh, QTEs...   TL;DR → They're not QTEs!  The takedown animations are just that: animations. I've said it elsewhere, but to those bemoaning the inclusion of QTEs into Doom don't know what they're talking about. It's not a QTE; it's just flashier way of doing the standard FPS melee attack animation than the hand-goes-foward-monster-falls-down schtick that FPS games usually do. Yes, once you see all the takedowns, the novelty will wear off in the same as Duke Nukem's quips or FarCry's healing animations or Halo's assassination animations or GTA V's character swap introductions or whathaveyou - but if you're seriously going to whine about a detail they've added; an ostensibly superfluous element that they've crafted purely to add flavour and delight to the game - then I'm not really sure what to tell you other than... I don't know... maybe make your own breakfast next time.   The chainsaw animation plays every time!   TL;DR → As a defacto superweapon, it needs to have a place in PVP.  This is probably the closest I've heard to a valid criticism. The chainsaw animations play every time you kill something, and for a game all about speed, forcing players into a locked animation while they watch enemies die seems anathema to the free flow of movement Doom is generally known for.  The problem is twofold: chainsaws are kind of hard to do convincingly in games, and the chainsaw - being iconic to the series - needs to both be larger than life and useful in PVP.  Typically when doing chainsaws, you have one of three routes; do a rapidfire hitscan weapon with zero range, do a chain""sword"" or do an instakill weapon with a lock-in animation.  Most games with chainsaws have historically fallen into the first camp (Killing Floor, OG-Dooms, Doom 3, Q3A, Unreal Tournament, Fallout: New Vegas, Left 4 Dead etc). The benefits of this style are freedom of movement, which is probably why it's been favoured by FPS titles in the past, but the cons are that it doesn't really 'feel' like much of a chainsaw; especially if you understand what zero-range hitscan means. You essentially just run at enemies, and they either fall apart as you approach, seldom even slowing you down, or they shrug it off as a glancing blow (especially in PVP) only to turn around and fill your face with hot lead.  The second style, the chain""sword"", is basically just that; a weapon that you wave at enemies that usually kills them instantly irrespective of where you hit them, which is dressed up with the sound and visuals of a chainsaw (think Saint's Row The Third, Dead Rising 2, Lollipop Chainsaw, Warhammer 40K: Space Marine etc). This style has the benefit of at least looking like a chainsaw is being used, but while great for the arcade-style titles, isn't very suited to tightly-wound shooters, especially if you're trying to make the chainsaw feel weighty and threatening (as opposed to a stick that, when waved, makes baddies turn into giblets).  The final style - which now includes Doom - is the lock-in animation. A one-hit kill which triggers an animation that I can only really recall previously seeing in the Gears of War franchise. Now, I'm probably biased in this respect as someone who enjoyed how the Lancers in Gears worked, but the idea of making it a kill-on-contact weapon seems great to me. Hearing the saw rev up in PVP sends shivers down your spine, because you know that once they close on you, you can't always just backpedal and blow them away after taking minimal damage.  While this could be counteracted by upping the DPS of a Type 1 chainsaw, it wouldn't make for the same kind of spectacle as a Type 3. Frankly, having the chainsaw as a superweapon just makes sense to me. It's so iconic to the franchise that it'd seem like a missed opportunity if they didn't find a way to make it useful in PVP, and if Gears has taught me anything, it's that butchering someone in PVP with rusty chainsaw looks - and feels - way more satisfying when you have an opportunity to savour the moment.  I mean, honestly, how often do you use the chainsaw when playing the original Doom games? Because as it stands, I only use it when I run out of shotgun shells.  Honorable mention to Dead Island Riptide for making the closest thing to a blend of all three types I can think of."
Doom,3alzmp,siledas,5,Mon Jun 22 14:04:47 2015 UTC,"(CONTINUED)   It's not Satanic enough!   TL;DR → You got me there, it;s not.  Does that really matter, though? The original games came out at a time when gaming was a much smaller industry and being transgressive was cool (and kind of expected) because the risks were much smaller - dev teams were essentially small groups of twenty-something year old guys who didn't really care what critics thought, and controversy usually had the effect of giving them free publicity.  Nowadays, controversy usually means lawsuits from puritanical busybodies and articles from tabloid gaming sites about how gamers are all obese basement-dwelling, racist/misogynist/neckbeard/euphoric/fedora-wearing/brony/mouth-breathers.  The Satanic imagery was just part of the parcel of the original dev team, in someways, cheekily wagging a middle finger at society. As such, Satanic imagery specifically isn't all that important to what makes Doom Doom.  That's not to say I wouldn't love to see more of that classic flaming-goat-pentagram upside-down cross shit in Doom, but honestly, I understand why they're not laying it on thick, and frankly it's not an integral aspect of why the original Doom is still enjoyable today.   The demon designs aren't demon-y enough!   TL;DR → ...demons don't exist?  Okay, so generally, this is a complaint about the art direction as a whole, but I've often heard it expressed as disappointment over the demons not looking like ""classical demons"" - especially the Cyberdemon, which I've heard looks too much like a moose.  Now, don't get me wrong - I've been a fan of Doom since the beginning, and I love the creature design of the first games - but the art style was all over the place. It had no cohesion. It drew inspiration from 80s Metal albums and Dungeons & Dragons, and blended it all in a brightly coloured, B-movie sci-fi aesthetic. The point was that it didn't really care that it was weird. It was cool and subversive and undoubtedly a product of both it's time and sub-cultural context. That kind of thing - besides being hard to do with today's dev teams, which now oftehn number in the hundreds - would probably just seem weird by today's standards. Insofar as developers are still doing it, they're usually love letters to those days when it was still normal (think FarCry Blood Dragon, Alan Wake's American Nightmare or Hotline Miami). I think part of the problem is that since the end of the 90s, it's hard to point at something (or some number of things) that can really define the intervening decades as well as Doom's influences can define the time that it's from.  To people saying that Doom's new art style is derivative and unoriginal have missed the point. The original Doom unashamedly ripped off a ton of things that the devs liked - the difference was that it wore those myriad influences on its sleeve, even if they came together in a clumsy way, and that's what made it endearing - it was essentially a mishmash of fan-service to whatever the devs were into at the time. Call the new art direction what you want, you're not likely to see anything like what the original guys did with the original game ever again. At least, not without a bunch of lawsuits associated with it.  So yeah, games have art styles now, and art direction is expected to be visually and thematically coherent. While that means we may never see another Doom quite like the original, in my opinion, that's probably a good thing.  Firstly because the original is special to me precisely because it's kind of weird, but most importantly because my appreciation for something isn't predicated upon whether or not it'll eventually be superseded in every way by its successors. That's just weird.  Plus, I don't just want to be fed the same thing again and again. There are already some insanely popular shooter franchises (which shall remain unnamed) that essentially slap a new label on corn flakes every year and call it innovative while their audience continues to fill up their bowls and ask for more.  I like that the new Doom is different, even if I ultimately turn out not to like every one of these differences in the long run. Variety is the spice of life, yadda yadda yadda.  Ultimately, just wait until you get your hands on it before venting your bile ducts.  If you still don't like it then, well - to each their own. Frankly, I'm fuckin' psyched!"

Doom,3alzmp,want_to_want,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed with many of your points about the art style, but IMO the issue is a bit simpler than that. The enemies in original Doom did actually have a coherent art style, though they didn't mesh with the levels very well. The big problem is that the art style doesn't easily translate to detailed 3D. That's not a problem unique to Doom. Try reimagining Nuclear Throne characters in detailed 3D, and you will also suddenly find that you need actual creative effort. The low-res art style just doesn't carry you all the way.  If you think of the task as not ""translating old Doom aesthetics"", but ""reimagining cyborg demons in detailed 3D"", many possibilities come to mind. For example, you could do what the Transformers movies did and make the creatures more mechanically intricate, so a cyberdemon would look like this. But of course that's not the only possible approach."
Doom,3alzmp,litdoomer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:03:56 2015 UTC,"You're being way too defensive and making a lot of assumptions.  Nevertheless I hope you're right but the proof (trailer says otherwise).  Nobody is saying doom4 is bad because it's different.  We are saying it's looking bad because it's so similar to all the other FPS' of today, more so then DOOM itself. Not good.  It's also clearly way too slow.  Not only is it clear in the SP video but the multiplayer video makes it glaringly obvious.   Quality over quantity is a cop out.  Having the capability of having more demons on the map/in each room  in substitution of some worthless graphics does nothing but allows infinitely more possibilities for different types of enemy encounters.  If ID does not want to add it then at least add the capability so the community can.  Proof: 20 years of history with doom1/2 modding/mapping.  I would agree it needs a fuck load more satanic imagery as well.  It's as if the creators don't even listen to the music of the beast any more."

Nobody is saying doom4 is bad because it's different.    Well, some people are. At least in the sense that it's not a carbon copy of the originals.   We are saying it's looking bad because it's so similar to all the other FPS' of today, more so then DOOM it's self.   How so? Health pickups, no ADS, faster clip, tons of guns, gory as all hell. Seems pretty distinct to me.  Sure they've added things like double-jump and mantling, but mechanically speaking, FPS game design is essentially remixing and tuning known variables these days. Their only options are to do modern game design, make the same game that Carmack and Co. did in the early 90s or try and strike a balance between the two, which appears to be the path they've gone for.  As far as I can tell, it looks like they've done a good job to this end, but like I'd said before, if the goal here is to impress every fan of the series, the task becomes Sisyphean.   It's also clearly way too slow. The multiplayer video makes it obvious.   Again, from what I can see in the videos, multiplayer clip looks on par with Q3A. If that's too slow for you, I'm not really sure what I can say, other than you might be setting your threshold for what qualifies as 'fast' a bit too high. It's obviously not as fast as the original games, but that's not a goal I ever expected them to reach (let alone aim for)."
Doom,3alzmp,Gothic_Banana,3,Mon Jun 22 23:36:47 2015 UTC,"I think the reason why everyone is complaining about the number of monsters that are faced at one time is that we're so used to playing WADs where the skill level needed to complete them is much higher than the skill level needed to complete doom 1 and 2. I mean there's always slaughter maps like holy hell and sunder, which are ungodly hard, but even WADs like Going Down, which was in last year's cacowards, are much more difficult than the original maps. And don't forget that when the ultimate doom was released with the addition of episode 4: thy flesh consumed, that new episode was advertised as being ""insanely hard,"" while in comparison to most WADs these days it isn't. The same thing happened with the release of Doom 2, with ads calling Doom 2 even harder than its predecessor. And when we take into account Doom 3, which had a bigger focus on the horror elements, the number of monsters you faced at any given time was roughly 1/2 to 3/4 the average amount in the originals. I'm sure with the release of Doom 4 next spring we'll see maps with hordes and hordes of enemies being thrown at us pop up in snapmap in no time."

Doom,3alzmp,mmSNAKE,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:40:17 2015 UTC,"I think they need to do whatever they need to do to allow us to make rooms with 20-30+ monsters AT LEAST.  It does not matter if they are all there to begin with or if they teleport/trap in somehow via line def trigger or whatever the hell.  If that means reducing the graphics then so be it.    Gameplay > graphics.  The more the merrier. The more we can have on screen at once then the more options there are to make intense and unique gameplay situations. One person mapping a room with 20+ daemons of their choice can make a completely different combat experience compared to another person mapping a single room with 20+ daemons. The proof of this is the hundreds of gigs of fan made wads from doom1/2. People in the community arguably make better maps and combat situations compared to the actual game creators with the exact same amount of resources. I know slaughter maps and wads like Drown In Blood or the like can get boring after a while and are out of the question with these insane graphics but don't bullshit me and tell me that it does not require skill, concentration, stamina to continuously dodge hundreds of player seeking rev missiles for an hour and playing these alternative map styles can be a breath of fresh air once in a while. A variety of small and narrow rooms with close encounters, mid sized rooms with traps/surprises/environment damage, and large scale mass demon holocausts all fit together and keep things fresh. There is a certain warm and fuzzy feeling you get when you spray a side by side stoeger coachgun buckshot across 6 or 7 bodies thenwatch them crumple to the ground four or five times within the same room.

Doom,3alzmp,TheGamePhilosophe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:36:36 2015 UTC,"My favorite instance of combat for older school shooters using Doom as example would be E4M3. Play that on Brutal Doom or Project Brutality on hardest difficulty. Especially project brutality.  That is an example where you juggle 10+ enemies at a time while still keeping it fair, focused and varied.  Serious Sam BFE (came out 4 years ago), for me is far better than any of the modern FPS games that came out. Hectic, arcade shooter where target priority, movement, environment and proper selection of arsenal really shines. That sort of stuff brings a smile to my face as I play.  Doom 4 is comparable to a lot of other shooters today. Or at least the demo is. This isn't bad, and I will probably like it for different reasons, but it isn't what I'd want out of a Doom game. Looking at the pace, target priorities, gun damage, gun efficiency in ratio to enemies. Game is comparable to games like Bioshock, new Shadow Warrior (though not on the hectic combat part with amount of enemies), Bulletstorm, Duke Nukem Forever, Hard Reset, Rage, Singularity etc. Now all those are fun games imo (except DNF, ugh), but they lack the frantic movement, pressure, strategy or tactics in older more twitch based shooters.   You might like Episode 1, I don't really. I generally replay E4 more than any other when ultimate doom is taken into consideration. I also like plutonia maps, TNT is a hit or miss and I use Doom 2 to test new mods because of my familiarity with it. Now with official release of Project Brutality the added difficulty, options and tactics is what makes all that shooting experience that much better. Though some maps the random factor can clearly tip the scale one way or the other if starting fresh (I'm looking at you Get 2 It).  What this game might offer. I don't know. It's early to tell with still a year off. The plasma gun might end up awesome instead of shooting sparks. The shotgun might actually be formidable against fodder enemies and there might be an option that speeds up the game (kind of like Turbo mode for DMC games). Any of that sort of stuff along with higher enemy density, options to not have health be dropped by enemies would make this amazing from from a new point of view and from taking older games into consideration.  I would just prefer new Doom to stand out, and not copy what most of the market is doing these days. Perhaps it will, but in the demo shown it does not."
Doom,3alzmp,pereza0,4,Sun Jun 21 17:14:36 2015 UTC,"Its still a bit early to tell, with the enemy number stuff.  Also, DOOM4 seems to have an emphasis on verticality none of those games had"
Doom,3alzmp,Littleman88,2,Sun Jun 21 17:17:53 2015 UTC,"Its still a bit early to tell   This point gets made a lot, but realistically, very little can be expected to change with the time remaining. Keep in mind that this game will have to pass console certification, which can take two months. They will not be able to make any more changes to code at that point. So this means they have maybe 8 months left for development.  With that much time, they are not going to risk major changes to the engine or level design. This time is for bug testing and optimization. No one is going re-record sounds or change the pace/nature of combat.  Id is clearly happy enough with where the game is at right now that they unveiled it publicly. They touted its speed, so clearly what we were shown is ""fast"" enough in their minds. They showed us an early map and a mid-game map, so we got a good sample of the gameplay. We have a very good idea of what the combat will be like. They made it quite clear in the demo.  Pipe dreams about how id is going revamp the whole game based on fan reactions or that there's some ""secret"" doom game hidden behind what we were shown are just that: pipe dreams. What we saw is what we're going to get essentially.   And to those who would point out that this was the year-old QuakeCon footage, so ""who knows where the game is at today,"" I would point out that id wouldn't do anything less than put their best foot forward for a reveal, so if they had better gameplay to show, they would have. Furthermore, if what we were shown is not representative of the game fundamentally, it would be false advertising."
Doom,3alzmp,pereza0,2,Sun Jun 21 21:36:16 2015 UTC,"I still wont be jumping to conclusions until I have more info.  These two demos were mostly about showcasing environments, enemies and weapons. From what I saw in the multiplayer trailer player speed seemed a lot faster there. Could it be they are inconsistent across SP and mp? Or did they just slow the walking speed for the demos? I wont pretend I can tell.  Similarly, I wouldnt automatically assume that there are not going to be higher enemy counts than what we saw in the demo until we have more info.  Not expecting DoomII enemy counts but I would be surprised if the handful of enemies shown in the trailer is everything the game can handle.  I doubt there will be keycard hunting or big complex levels but I read that arenas will generally be a bit open (the Hell one kinda was)"
Doom,3alzmp,Littleman88,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:14:17 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly confident there will be keycard hunting and complex levels.  ""Big"" however I'll agree is ambiguous.  Maybe maps could be big, but they might lack decoration to compensate.  Map editors like Snapmap tend to have hard imposed limits so people don't feel compelled to make some world sized facility and decorate every bleeding square inch of it and blowing away all but the most hardcore of gaming PCs.  As a baseline, I figure it will at least double the capacity of Timesplitters: Future Perfect's map creator, and that's a lowball number.  I could make pretty big maps in that creator, but at 50 enemy spawn locations tops, I was limited to smaller maps just so each encounter could include a few targets at once.  I doubt ID would settle for so few targets in Snapmap.  We certainly won't."
Doom,3alzmp,Hofmann83,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:50:49 2015 UTC,"Either way, snapmap is probably just a tool made so anyone can use it (including a guy with a controller like in the video).

It's actually a HEAVILY optimized engine, since it was designed to run Rage at 60fps on the Xbox360 and PS3. A great amount of work was put into optimizing Tech 5 for 60fps on aging consoles, especially the PS3.  This obviously doesn't excuse them from the shitty texture pop-in that a lot of people experience(d). But, with the right settings, even my potato computer is free of the pop-in."

I'm amused by how this has become relevant for players who played the classics after Doom 3.  Before I forget, here's a protip of mine own: Arch-viles have a very high pain resistance, therefore their attacks have a low chance of being interrupted with most firearms. Enter Super Shotty; at melee range the SSG has a 50% chance of putting an Archvile in pain-state and interrupting their attack. This is because of the high pellet count hitting him all at once.

Doom,3ai1ix,De-M-oN,4,Sat Jun 20 14:15:05 2015 UTC,yes the chaingun and thats a HUGE advantage.  It saves so much ammo. Its unbelievable. Never hold fire if not close range. And yes you can snipe enemies from any range due to this.

Non-hitscan monsters won't ever fight with another monster of the same type (ie imp vs imp won't happen). And also no monster will ever fight an archvile.

Doom,3ainj7,Scissorman1985,5,Sat Jun 20 20:53:54 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind a level or two of quiet suspense before the demonic shit hits the fan. That's one thing Doom 3 did well; the superb build-up to the sudden but inevitable explosion of weird supernatural horror.
Doom,3ainj7,argv_minus_one,2,Sat Jun 20 23:12:42 2015 UTC,"I hope there is one—a skippable one—to watch and be amazed at the first few times, and then periodically rewatch for nostalgia's sake."

Doom,3ainj7,PancakeMSTR,4,Sat Jun 20 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with an introductory section like Doom 3 and Half Life. It sets up the background and atmosphere and establishes the ""normal"" circumstances and setting before it all gets torn the fuck apart. However, I would prefer it to be more like Half Life's in that you can just sprint through most of it on subsequent playthroughs. Doom 3's intro had far too much ""stand still while characters talk at you.""   Basically, if it takes me less than 5 minutes on secondary playthroughs... whatever. That isn't terribly offensive. Just don't make me sit through a feature length film. each time."
Doom,3ainj7,slushcountry,4,Sun Jun 21 04:59:36 2015 UTC,"Dude...I don't get this. That was what made Doom 3 amazing to me. It gave you such a sense of atmosphere.   I, for one, hope they take Doom 4 in the direction of a real horror game. Doom 3, but refined and better."
Doom,3ainj7,argv_minus_one,4,Sat Jun 20 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"you and i agree, but we're in the minority. personally, i'd love to see a big contrast between legit horror segments and big demun shootan parts. make it like a roller coaster, not just endless pew-pew-pew. if it's all action, then really none of it is.  see, that's the thing, everyone acts like doom 1 and 2 were just endless action but a lot of the maps actually made great use of tension-building elements and map structure for their time. i hate to go all no-true-scotsman on this but i swear most of the people begging for ""more action"" are just Brutal Doom bandwagoners (which, idk, seems to be the target demographic for Doom 4...)."
Doom,3ainj7,PancakeMSTR,3,Sat Jun 20 19:28:53 2015 UTC,Brutal Doom doesn't break that tension. E1M8 isn't any less creepy-tense-awesome just because the Barons explode more messily.  I enjoyed Doom 3. I also enjoyed Brutal Doom. I'm with you—I want both!
Doom,3ainj7,monkey_butt_plug,2,Sat Jun 20 19:54:13 2015 UTC,"Right, I think that the best solution is striking a balance.   I really loved Doom 3, but one of its failings is that you can kinda beat the whole game by waiting for an enemy around a corner to shoot it point blank with a shotgun.   Which is kinda why the foundry section in the Doom 4 demo  looked pretty neat, it's a big open arena.   But at the same time, Doom 3 really excelled, in my opinion, in making the world feel real (in it's own way), and it certainly provided a fantastic atmosphere.   And, again, with the Hell-knight hologram recording scene in the Doom 4 demo, that bodes well for there being a good atmosphere in the new one as well.   At any rate, I hope it comes out really well, and I'm definitely super excited for the new Doom."
Doom,3ainj7,S1GMA,2,Sun Jun 21 19:03:08 2015 UTC,I will bet my money that there is an opening cutscene leading to the camera entering the marines body.  Just like doom 3.  id has opened many games in a similar way.

DOOM 3's kinda was like that, as it didn't really slow down the game too much, but the characters were uninspired and the whole thing was just plain boring. The only interesting parts were the Bioshock-style audio logs, but they clash with the fast pace nature of DOOM 4's gameplay. I really hope id knows what they are doing.
