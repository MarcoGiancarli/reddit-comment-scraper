Indiana,3e4pj6,Besca,9,Tue Jul 21 22:58:41 2015 UTC,But poverty is up 30% since the recession.  It's almost like we ditched all our well-paid jobs and replaced them with shit jobs.
Indiana,3e4pj6,Used-Car-Salesman,6,Wed Jul 22 02:01:25 2015 UTC,"I mean, that's pretty much what happened.  Couple that with the fact that a lot of Indiana's workers are aging blue-collar workers who don't have any certifications because they didn't need one when they started doing their job 40 years ago, and you have a compounded problem. Even when blue collar work opens up, the positions that pay at a rate comparable to what these people used to make require some pretty specialized credentials. In the East Central Indiana region, former factory towns like Anderson and Muncie get passed over when factories open, because company R&D shows that the existing workforce lacks the skills they'd need.  My job is actually to help people who receive government benefits transition to the workforce, and it's really hard to tell a guy who made $40/hr driving a forklift for a few decades that he'll be lucky to get $12.75/hr to do the same thing now. There's still a belief among a lot of that workforce that the high-paying factory job for people who didn't graduate high school and refuse to get an HSE is coming back."
Indiana,3e4pj6,TitoTheMidget,2,Wed Jul 22 02:19:25 2015 UTC,"In Indiana, if you didn't at least graduate high school, you should probably just jump off a bridge. I think even McDonalds wants people to at least have a HSD now.   That forklift driver was probably in a union way back when. Unsurprisingly, when a state declares war on unions like Indiana and many other Republican states have, employers get away with paying new hires a fraction of what that job used to be worth. If you complain, you get fired for not being grateful enough that the company didn't just pack up and move to China.   The worst thing is the state is spending literally billions of dollars in tax credits and free infrastructure improvements and virtually free property/construction to poach jobs from other states. It's just reinforcing this negative feedback loop that only has one outcome: Worse wages and conditions for workers, and fatter profits for executives and shareholders.   It just makes me so goddamn angry to see Pence and his buddies cheerleading for Indiana's economy when even a cursory look at the actual numbers shows this state is a freaking toilet."
Indiana,3e4pj6,Used-Car-Salesman,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:29:21 2015 UTC,"And, my perception anyway, if you were a hiring manager and saw a guy with a Bachelor's degree and some solid work history in his field, you wouldn't even consider him for that same $12 forklift job. I've left the degree and some of my work experience off my resume to try to get some of those jobs. My Dad loves to tell me about the time he took a crappy job in the '80s bagging the topsoil they sell at Lowes, but the reality is, I'm never, ever going to get a job like that no matter how much I need it.  One of those interviews I did have was to wash dishes for $8/hour, and it started with both of us admitting that I knew I wasn't going to stay longer than I had to but needed to keep my electricity on, and that I knew the owner would much rather have somebody who could grind away at that station and pay rate forever. We shook hands and that was the end of the interview."

Indiana,3e4pj6,Solkre,9,Wed Jul 22 01:36:35 2015 UTC,"It's more like ""getting given up on"". I have bills and 3 kids, great experience and degree, and have had 4 interviews in 18 months. When every job you apply for is ""perfect for me!"", and also 800 other people, it gets frustrating and hopeless. So, the next day, you don't apply to so many. A few days later and it becomes vacation. A few weeks later, and it's like ""well, I know I need this but it's $8/hr. and 20 hours a week when I used to make $40k annually, so why bother?"" More frustrating and hopeless, and as you fall behind on those bills and disappoint those 2 (or 3) kids, it spirals."

Indiana,3dxir5,PacoBedejo,2,Mon Jul 20 23:44:11 2015 UTC,"Having a licence to carry and knowing how to defend yourself ( or at least not shoot yourself) is far different then knowing how to defend others in an hostile shooter situation. Teachers and even many of those military recruiters aren't trained in this type of situation, to minimize risk to others. It's easy to shoot back, it's not as easy to do it in a way to preserve the lives of others ( besides yourself)."

Definitely an improvement over some other states.  The only way it could be better is if teachers had the choice to be armed, or at least designated staff."
Indiana,3dxir5,gpia7r,5,Mon Jul 20 15:42:09 2015 UTC,"The only way it could be better is if teachers had the choice to be armed   I wholeheartedly disagree for both practical and emotional reasons.   The practical: In Indiana there are no mandatory gun safety classes that have to be taken to get a carry permit. It's possible for someone who's never shot a gun before to get their carry permit. That already makes me uncomfortable when I'm walking around with my kids at Kroger. Now add into that a place where kids are the majority, and the parent has no say in whether or not they want an untrained individual carrying a deadly weapon around them. There have to be some standards, and right now, as a parent of two young kids, I would feel like my children would be less safe with a teacher carrying a gun. Now, if there was some kind of mandatory gun safety and  situational response training similar to what our police get for these teachers, I might feel differently about it. But as it stands, no way would I feel comfortable with that.  The emotional: do we really want to live in a place where we have to have armed guards standing in every door? Why do we have this problem with mass shootings? It's not because we have more guns, Canada per capita has just about as many guns. What is wrong with our culture that has nursed this environment of violence? Is it sparse access to proper mental health treatment? Is it deeper than that? I don't know. What I do know is that I don't want my kids to grow up in a world where everyone needs to carry a gun to feel safe."
Indiana,3dxir5,MatthewSmith58,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:22 2015 UTC,"I would imagine, and encourage, some sort of situational training for any teacher or staff member that wished to be an armed responder.  I don't think this sort of special case should fall under the same civilian rules for self-defense carrying. Schools are easy targets for those that want to be glorified on the news for a month or so.  We don't have a shooting problem, we have a school shooting problem.  These people pick them, show no remorse.  Historically when they are confronted with an armed response, they end up killing themselves on the spot.   Regarding today's climate... I absolutely see the need to increase firearm use.  People like ISIS are telling American sympathizers to target our military in their homes.  These people seek out places like recruiting facilities... which are gun-free... because they know they won't be met with resistance.   People in these high-risk areas should have the option to protect themselves.  In the instance of schools - I'd prefer an officer be on the school grounds at all times.  That's all that's needed, that presence.  It doesn't create a negative environment for the students.  It's just a layer of deterrence that can only cause a positive outcome.  There are plenty of people that would volunteer for this cause.  There are people right now showing up at military recruiting facilities and ""standing guard"" outside.  It may be more symbolic than anything, but it shows people would be willing to do it."
Indiana,3dxir5,gpia7r,3,Mon Jul 20 18:35:50 2015 UTC,"The issue is a little more than school shootings. The shooting in Charlotte, the shooting in Aurora, the shooting at Ft. Hood, shooting at the Navy Yard, the couple from Indiana that killed the police officer and put a Gadsden flag on his corpse, two people today who got shot on Rural Street...all had nothing to do with schools. And that's just off the top of my head, I'm sure there are more examples. Schools are obviously are target for someone who wants to kill a lot of people, but it's not the only kind of gun violence problem we have. It's especially bad because it targets some of our most   vulnerable citizens, but it's definitely more than just a school shooting problem.   And I'm a little uncomfortable with people volunteering their time for protecting those vulnerable places. Like, why are you off work at 2pm on a Monday? And if we're asking for volunteers to protect our schools, who can be at a school from 7am-3pm standing guard without some kind of compensation? Maybe someone who's retired? But then you've got to think, is that really okay? It's a question of quality. I'd rather have nobody than some George Zimmerman-esque  vigilante following around kids they deem to be suspicious.  I'm not saying the no gun zones is the best solution, but what I am saying is that letting anybody willy-nilly carry a gun around a bunch of kids is not a great solution either. It has to be a little more thoughtful than that."
Indiana,3dxir5,MatthewSmith58,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you've said. But I'd like to point out that the best thing to do is to let teachers achieve some sort of qualification, then pay them extra if they responsibly carry at work. Adding to the school's protection is valuable and should be highly regarded and at least minimally rewarded."
Indiana,3dxir5,PacoBedejo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:46:23 2015 UTC,"I would support something like that if the standards were clearly defined. I'm not the kind of guy who hates guns or distrusts everyone with a gun, because I really do feel most people who carry are responsible people.

I would expect if my kid's school were going to let someone carry around my kids that they would at least be compensated for their time. With that you can demand quality service."

This is the closest I can find:  http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2012/07/24/three-wounded-as-gun-discharges-inside-dallas-wal-mart/  The bullet caused debris to hit the ankles of 3 other people.

While I think it's gross negligence to leave your children wholly unguarded, it's a popular enough form of negligence that I suppose you ought to have the ability to decide whether your child attends a safe school or not. There's no better way to ensure this ability to choose than to put education into the competing hands of free enterprise.   do we really want to live in a place where we have to have armed guards standing in every door?

The ease and availability of firearms made it possible for this terrorist (let's call a spade, a spade) to commit this terrible attack.  If less guns were available to begin with, perhaps, this situation would never have happened.

Indiana,3dru4u,hansorg,5,Sun Jul 19 23:42:39 2015 UTC,I just don't think it's a good idea to legally enable every security situation to turn into the shootout at the O.K. Corral. I know there are two schools of thought on this. I'm just in the school that thinks less guns is better than more. Especially considering that for every gun that exists in a particular location it becomes 7 times more likely that you're going to hurt yourself or someone you know than actually successfully fend off an intruder.
Indiana,3dru4u,sleeplessorion,0,Sat Jul 18 23:56:31 2015 UTC,"So your saying they shouldn't be able to defend themselves? If ""less guns is better"", should we disarm all the police?

Indiana,3dnin3,Solkre,2,Fri Jul 17 22:50:35 2015 UTC,"The interesting thing here is that the surplus resulted from Pence ordering state agencies to cut their budgets by 4-5% regardless of what the legislature says. The legislature is supposed to have control over the budget process, but they gave the governor special powers to make decisions when the legislature isn't in session, and he's abused it to force more (and less obvious) budget cuts on the agencies to build this little pile of money.   Yeah, a rainy day fund isn't a bad thing, but that money could go to restore some of the huge number of government jobs cut since the recession, or fix crumbling roads, or gasp even start transitioning Indiana toward clean energy.   It does no good sitting there as a conversation piece for Republicans to point to and brag about how responsible they are."

Indiana,3di42z,TheClapper,4,Thu Jul 16 19:32:09 2015 UTC,If they can keep people. The turnover rate at that warehouse is atrocious. I walked out after three weeks a month and a half a few months ago and the staffing agency they use has been calling me daily trying to get me to come back. It's not the worst job in the world but it was pretty miserable.
Indiana,3di42z,Seiroku,3,Fri Jul 17 02:12:02 2015 UTC,Can you explain why it is miserable?
Indiana,3di42z,Idie_999,3,Fri Jul 17 05:09:56 2015 UTC,"I was a picker, which I'd heard was a lot of walking, but that's not the whole story. I pushed a cart for ten hours at a time across solid concrete or some kind of wooden paneling in the upper floors. I had to bend down, stretch up, lift, push, and pull, and the entire time you're lugging around this 3lb scanner that records your number of units per hour, and actually has a countdown timer for some kind of 'average' time it should take you to get to the next item on your list (usually about two seconds faster than a normal walking pace would get you there). You'd push your cart to the aisle and row where the item was listed, reach up or bend down (about 10ft clearance, and the shelves were stacked to the ceiling) to grab your item, scan it, and toss it in the tote. Only sometimes your item looked exactly like every other one in the box, but they all had different UPC codes and the scanner would beep sternly at you every time you scanned a wrong one. I once had to stand at one bin for something like fifteen minutes scanning through about sixty identical wallet clip boxes before I found the right one. And if you tried to increase your average item count by keeping your tote through more than a couple of orders worth of stuff, the supervisor would close out your tote and send you a text on the scanner saying to make sure to send your totes in every 15 minutes.   I was monitored every step of the way by one of over 3000 cameras in the warehouse, which may not bother some, but it made me slightly uncomfortable. Also, since they deal with electronics, you couldn't bring your phone into the warehouse. They have security gates and metal detectors at the exits, and if you just happen to be groggy from waking up an hour ago and forget that your phone is in your pocket, tough shit, you're gonna spend either your whole first 15 minute paid break or half your lunch standing at the security desk waiting for one of the security crew to come and make sure that, yes, this is your phone, just let us get a copy of your MEID number and you can go, and then the next day you get slapped with a writeup. For forgetting the goddamn thing in your pocket. All this, even though almost 95% of the electronics are locked behind a caged-in fourth floor that you have to have special clearance to access.   The worst part, though, was the walking. I bought new shoes two weeks before starting there, and when I quit they looked and felt like I'd worn them for a year. My feet hurt so bad at the end of the day that I didn't want to move, and no combination of insoles or inserts helped. Tried soaking my legs in a tea tree salt mix with no relief. Ten hours straight on concrete is hell. All of this combined into a miserable month and a half (I forgot about a couple of weeks in my initial post, must've blocked them out) of Hell. Some people can handle the walking, some can handle being watched, some can handle the bullshit, but it definitely wasn't the right job for me."

Indiana,3dhv7y,Tonamel,5,Thu Jul 16 20:37:56 2015 UTC,"You're right that I can't find a more recent picture, but here's a study from 2009.   Barefoot walkers had wider feet and more equally distributed peak pressures, i.e. the entire load carrying surface was contributing more uniformly than in habitually shod subjects, where regions of very high or very low peak pressures were more apparent.   …  The evolutionary history of humans shows that barefoot walking is the biologically natural situation. The use of footwear remains necessary, especially on unnatural substrates, in athletics, and in some pathologies, but current data suggests that footwear that fails to respect natural foot shape and function will ultimately alter the morphology and the biomechanical behaviour of the foot.   I'm not a super evangelist for being barefoot, really, I just know some of the arguments. I figure as long as you can wiggle your toes, you're probably doing alright."

Shoes and socks is pretty much the norm (especially with a trail run). Typically the mix is about 80 / 20 male female (no surprise)  If it is their first year it may be a smaller crowd (BB was about 45 the first year and now over 150)  Nobody will judge you if you do / do not wear something while running so do whatever you are ok with.

Indiana,3dh76u,ChineseEyes,2,Thu Jul 16 14:10:29 2015 UTC,"I think most people realize that. They probably think that ""druggies"" (read: meth heads, because that's what we have in Indiana) will hide weed in with the hemp. They don't know that to get good weed, the very last place you'd want to put it is a hemp field(!), and that people already do that with corn fields. This is where legalization in other states really helps. If you can already get Colorado or California weed, why bother with Indiana weed? Other states have already cashed that chip. Indiana is in a prime position to move on hemp, however. Knowing how backward and behind the times my state can be I really doubt we'll be the first ones out of the gate though. One can always hope.

The best description I've heard of her tenure as superintendent of public instruction is that she never stopped campaigning. My impression of her is that she is ineffective, self-centered, and a demagogue. I've heard her speak, boring, unoriginal observations and generic promises wthout any concrete plan of action.

Indiana,3dedjw,What_Truth,3,Thu Jul 16 05:00:34 2015 UTC,"Just a warning, I'm going on a big rant here. Ritz is going to be the target, but it may not necessarily be her fault. /disclaimer  Glenda Ritz sucks. I mean truly she sucks. It is partially not her fault, but what's become of everything since her election has been awful for the Democrat Party. First of all, it may not be totally her fault because the Ds just tossed the teachers unions a bone and let her be the sacrificial lamb to what was going to be a Tony Bennett steamrolling. However as the late summer months wore on it was clear that many moderates had some real issues with our education system's direction. Whether it be statewide testing, common core or school grades a lot of moderates were pissed. This led to a pretty historical victory for Ritz as she was the candidate that was not Tony Bennett.   Never mind that she was a school librarian and ISTA board member who oversaw a $30+ million dollar ponzi scheme against ISTA members. Also let's take a moment and realize that yes, she was a librarian. I don't know about you guys, but my high school librarian basically supervised proper use of the library and study halls. That was it. There are umpteen thousand teachers in the state that were more qualified than her. She just happen to be a prominent member in the teachers union and got the nod.   When she gets into office, the first thing she does is cause untold chaos at State Board Meetings. It was partially her fault, it was partially the fault of the governor appointed board members. 1-2 of them in particular. But in the face of adversity she handled it about as poorly as you could. She walked out of a meeting when things weren't going her way. Had her staff shut down the live streaming and take the equipment with them so that the board couldn't continue their public meeting without her. She took her ball and went home.   She went before the state legislature's Education Committee to lobby for some of her proposed legislative changes. Testified, but refused to take questions and walked away before any could be asked. Leaving her staffers to answer any questions or concerns.   She withheld updates from the SBOE on the readiness of some statewide testing changes. She was asked about them months in advance and didn't inform the board that could do something about the testing that stuff was not going to work out until it was too late to adjust the test or change the dates of testing. This resulted in a pretty embarrassing execution on the part of McGraw Hill and local administrations.  Amidst all of that, she is somehow the face of the Democrat Party. Not Joe Donnelly, not Scott Pelath or Tim Lanane. Hell not even John Gregg. Glenda Ritz. With her victory we basically handed control of the Democrat Party to ISTA and said here, go win us elections.   How did that work out? ISTA outspent every single other organization in the 2014 elections and lost a net 5 legislative seats. They achieved what was nearly demographically impossible. Turning a Republican super majority into an even larger majority while spending $1.25 million in the process. Hell even the Indianapolis school board members that received Ritz and company's backing lost.   I'm not even a staunch Democrat or Republican. I feel that Indiana is best served when both parties of our two party system are strong. Instead we have a Republican party with a deep roster of capable and qualified candidates. And a Democrat party that is retreading candidates from the 90s and early aughts. Now I know there is plenty of talent and new blood out there, but where is it? At this rate we're likely going on 16 years of a Democrat party in the wilderness. Personally I think we/they should be throwing Joe Donnelly in front of anyone and everyone. Even Republicans like that dude. He needs to be the face of this party. Instead we have the zero cooperation, no effort, self-centered echo chamber that is Glenda Ritz. It's like if the Republicans had managed to get Richard Mourdock elected.   TL:DR I think Ritz is bad, yet her victory made her the face of the party. She's been terrible and it has set the Democrats back years in competitiveness. Instead of being offensive in strategy they have to sit and wait for the Republicans to screw up to have a legit shot. Even then, their chances aren't the strongest."

However, having met both him and Ritz he's the superior thinker, has more class, and definitely more composure.  I get the sense the major players in the Democratic Party are almost afraid of Ritz. She commands a large blocks of tea party like email organized Voters but the Democratic Party has failed to build anything similar. I also get the sense that many people are simply patiently waiting for her to fail under her own incompetence and are not willing to risk any political capital challenging her in public."
Indiana,3dedjw,sleeplessorion,2,Thu Jul 16 14:34:23 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Adbul reported that basically the entire party mechanism tried to talk her out of this governor run. There's a lot of fear they're going to lose the Superintendent office in the process.

They all think she's an idiot and panicked slightly when she actually won to be superintendent.   Edit: Let's give a little more concrete example. She ran for Superintendent 3 years ago now. She's still carrying a $35k debt from that election that has yet to be paid off. Against the advice of everyone but her inner staff, she stated she was going to run for governor. Pretty much no one showed up to her big kick off announcement. In the mean time she's raised $30k and spent more than that. Meaning she currently has less in her account than when she started running for governor. There is lot of evidence out there that her DoE staff is doing campaign activities on state time, she raised a chunk of that $30k in January and February when there is a moratorium on campaign fundraising and the media can't even contact her campaign because they have no idea who to call.   Now of course it isn't a perfect analogy, but if she can't handle running a campaign for governor how in the world is she going to handle running the actual state. Add in the fact that ISTEP was a nightmare under her watch and she's probably the worst option of the 4 currently running. Teachers love her and nobody else. Her original victory was a firing of Tony Bennett and nothing more."

But, since you really wanna pull the generic ""but Europe"" & ""but Asia"" cards, I'll only say that just because their theft-based government education centers are more effective than ours doesn't mean that theft-based government education is the best way to go. Kids don't learn in schools. Schools are daycare. In my experience, kids learn best in a healthy Montessori-like or apprenticeship-style arrangement. There aren't any worthwhile studies to cite either way, as there's a deeply entrenched financial interest in the current arrangement.

A lot of what's left are, by objective measures, doing worse than public schools. There are some great private and charter schools, but there are also a whole lot of shitty ones.  The state has poured a lot of time, money and effort into its privatization efforts, and there's no evidence that our education system is any better off as a result. Meanwhile they've been hamstringing public school budgets to try to feed more money into this private school system that has produced very few quality schools.  I'm not opposed to the idea that moving towards a more privatized educational model can work - but there's little evidence that that's the case, and I am opposed to essentially warehousing hordes of students whose parents can't be bothered to give a damn about their education in public schools that lose funding with every student they lose."
Indiana,3dedjw,Mega_Dragonzord,2,Thu Jul 16 01:13:49 2015 UTC,"We also have a system in place to close failing charters. Many neighborhood schools have been 'failing' for decades. At what point can we look for alternatives and say they have failed?  Also, many charters are giving kids much more opportunity than they would otherwise have under no choice. Many of those failing charters are failing because they are growing so fast and the newer children are so far behind. Most show that the kids that stay with them move ahead faster than in their home schools.  And there is a whole truckload of data that people are better off now than they were. In the past only 15% of all school systems had anything at all to offer kids who were working ahead of their peers. Now there are virtual charters that let any kid in the state work as far ahead and as fast as they like. These kids can take high school courses while enrolled in middle school. Compare that to ten years ago where it was unheard of to care about a middle school student who could be doing calculus.   Neighborhood schools are getting as much money per student as they used to. There is no divine right that gives schools corporations  10 grand a year for every child born in their district. Schools corporations have to get over that feeling of entitlement. If they have less money it is because they are educating fewer kids. Don't call that injustice. Call it smaller."

Indiana,3dedjw,PacoBedejo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:45:01 2015 UTC,"The issue in your link was remedied in this last legislative session. Corporations with low complexity rates (code for low poverty) were getting the shaft in comparison to other school districts.   Studies have shown that high poverty neighborhoods need more funds to accomplish similar academic outcomes to their wealthier brethren, but the disparity was insane. They changed the funding formula this year. Munster was one of the top ""winners"" with this change.   As an aside, the bottom of that link is completely garbage. Funding was cut in 2009 because we slammed into a recession. Property values went in the tank, tax revenue bottomed out hard and the choice was cut spending or drastically raise taxes. The schools were the last ones to receive a cut. They have since been restored to historically high funding. Nearly a $1.5 billion increase in the last two budget cycles."
Indiana,3dedjw,whtevn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:41:24 2015 UTC,"School funding is really complicated and I don't know anything about Munster specifically, but I'll assume based on some of the other school districts listed that you have a problem with funding because you are in a fast growing, fairly well off school district. Those are the places that are suffering the most under the new formula that went into effect about 2008. That problem is actually a different one than just losing kids to charters.   Basically the formula was designed (as I understand it) to smooth things out for districts with falling enrollment and made too many assumptions about well off school systems being able to take care of themselves. I think eyes were on IPS and not Carmel at the time. So for example, if I put my kid in kindergarten and then withdraw that kid, if the school system has falling enrollment, the district will still get 80 percent of the money for the next year, 60% the next and so on as it decreases by about 20% each year. So the elementary school where my kid went first is still getting money for years. Because no trailing money is given a school if enrollment is growing and because new money is phased in, schools in fast growing districts are getting less per student because they are pretty much missing out on a lot of complexity dollars.   I think to correct this a new formula will have to have money follow more closely the child instead of primarily funding school districts  with some tweaking for growing or falling numbers.  That sounds like it will also cause pain and be hard to do. Some school corporations (Zionsville and MCCSC as examples) are passing local funding bills to just pay the schools more. I realize that solution is also painful."

Indiana,3dbbd5,mysteriousPerson,4,Tue Jul 14 23:07:34 2015 UTC,"Hi,  I'm a Mormon, and I wanted to invite readers of /r/Indiana to take advantage of a genuinely rare opportunity to see the inside of a Mormon Temple. (The church is officially known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.) Each temple is opened to the public once, for a brief period, after it is constructed. Then, the leader of the Church comes and blesses the building, and it is no longer open to the public.  We won't try to convert you--you just tour the temple in groups with a guide, who explains the significance of the rooms. They have interesting names. One room usually contains a statue of 12 oxen carrying a baptismal font, in accordance with our practice of baptizing living people on behalf of those who have died.   Of course, they'd love it if you asked to learn more about the religion, but they know that most people are just interested in seeing the inside of our temples.   It's super interesting, fun, and free.   God bless,  /u/mysteriousPerson"

Indiana,3cwp1d,pateras,9,Sat Jul 11 12:43:09 2015 UTC,"There's semi-famous enduro (long distance off-road motorcycle race) that goes through one of the camps at Roselawn called the Summer Bummer. It's held in August, and it's always hot as balls. There's a lot of jokes in the pits about ""watch out for the Bares.""   So my row starts and about a mile in, there's 2 cute 20-something girls nekkid and cheering on all the riders as we passed. ""Gonna be a good race,"" I think as I throw some horns and ""wooo!"" on the way past them. As enduros are long races, we follow the course off the property.   Four grueling hours later, 99 degrees and million percent humidity, starting to suffer from dehydration, more sand whoops than I ever wanted to see, and nary a nipple since those four at the start. I start thinkin, ""watch our for the bares, my ass. This is a bunch of bullshit."" Had I been more alert, I would have noticed the trail thread back into the property.   I round a corner and can see some people a few seconds up the trail. There's a little jump, so I goose it, launching out of the woods into a clearing. Still in the air, I see them. A baldish gentleman in his 60's and a Crave Case north of 300lbs, accompanied by his lady friend of a similar vintage, with skin that appeared to be made of Jack Links beef jerky...both jumpin up and down and cheering like contestants on the Price is Right. Holy shit. My brain locked up as the bike landed. My foot slipped off the peg and I landed on the tank square on my balls. The bike managed to stay up-right and I just kept going. Made it through the finish a few minutes later, got to my pit, and barely got my helmet off before I hurled.   Watch out for the bares, indeed."

I understand now why the legislature has put so much emphasis on education and skills training in recent years. If our workforce was even middle of the road we'd be a top 5 state. Instead we're sitting at 13. Quality of life and workforce are the only categories where we are below average and in those cases we are significantly so.   A new LGBT non-discrimination law and improved health would help significantly in that quality of life ranking.

It's located on the southwest side of town and has a lake and trails. Metea (N side of FW near Leo) is pretty nice, as well, though not as big.   The Children's Zoo is nice and has some biking trails in the surrounding park area that people utilize for foot traffic, as well. There's a creek that runs through it and a pond with birds and stuff outside the zoo, too.   Little bit farther out, there are some state parks. My personal favorite is Chain O' Lakes near Albion. There's at least 16 miles of pretty ell-groomed trails out there. Canoeing and kayaking out there is so fun because the lakes are literally all connected (hence the name). Ouabache State Park is near Bluffton (S of FW) and there's a few around Huntington, as well.

Sherbert and Yoder require a very strict scrutiny, but in Yoder, Burger says that    Thus, if the Amish asserted their claims because of their subjective evaluation and rejection of the contemporary secular values accepted by the majority, much as Thoreau rejected the social values of his time and isolated himself at Walden Pond, their claims would not rest on a religious basis. Thoreau's choice was philosophical and personal, rather than religious, and such belief does not rise to the demands of the Religion Clauses.   I would submit that the CoC has missed those wise words of Justice Burger, and is trying to get philosophical/personal beliefs treated as deeply held religious beliefs.  Such an approach, while legally quite interesting, is destined to fail.  I question their attempt at being a test case not because their leader is nuts, as others have suggested, but because they have no case.  Their church has existed for months, not generations.  If Thoreau's musings do not meet the test, the ramblings of these folks certainly do not."

Indiana,3cl5pi,zardwiz,3,Thu Jul 9 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"The effects of marijuana are relevant, because the RFRA requires the government to prove it has a compelling interest, and is using the least restrictive means. If marijuana is largely harmless with almost no externalities, the state will have a much harder time justifying the prohibition.  I agree that they may run into trouble proving the sincerity of their beliefs. That doesn't mean it's impossible. The 9th circuit court already recognized that smoking marijuana was a valid religious practice for Rastafarians. If a Rastafarian church were to open up, it may pave the way for this type of church."

They would have a much eaiser path had they just opened up a Rastafarian church.  I don't disagree with what they're trying to do, it's just not the road I might have chosen as a test case."

Indiana,3cl5pi,gpia7r,13,Wed Jul 8 19:38:30 2015 UTC,"The idea is not that the RFRA specifically legalized something, but that it increased the Government's burden of proving that they have a compelling interest to restrict any activities associated with a religious belief and that they do it in the least restrictive way possible.  While I don't think the church will even get as far as being recognized as a religion, they are making the case that arresting people for something that is legal in other states (unlike Heroin, Cocaine, and Murder) is not the least restrictive thing they could do and, in fact, the Government does not have a compelling interest to restrict religious use of something that you can get a prescription for in half of the country."

Indiana,3cl5pi,hoosierstateofmind,-4,Wed Jul 8 23:46:29 2015 UTC,They are recognized as a religious organization. Not a religion.   Just reread that. I'll wait.
Indiana,3cl5pi,silverhythm,6,Wed Jul 8 23:52:14 2015 UTC,There is a difference between the IRS designating your organization a religious non-profit for tax purposes and the court considering that organization a religion as established under case law.

Indiana,3cl5pi,silverhythm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:09:42 2015 UTC,"That's why this RFRA law is actually really important. The United States government cannot recognize religions. They are in charge of protecting sincere religious beliefs under the first amendment. But can make no law recognizing one religion over another. Without a RFRA law (or other court precedent, which we had before this and therefore the legislation was unneccesary) you would not be able to challenge the government on your sincere religious beliefs.   Now with RFRA you can. And if they are deemed sincere, such as say Holy Rosary Parish, the IRS will give you large breaks on certain taxes. Or if you're Muslim, you can grow a beard in a prison where the rules say no facial hair. Or the Amish won't be required to put headlights on their buggies. Or Rastafarians can possess and smoke weed in very specific, tightly controlled situations.   The reason why Levin and his folks are fighting a losing battle is because they've made if very public and very clear that they're just doing this to take a piss at the state."
Indiana,3cl5pi,hoosierstateofmind,3,Thu Jul 9 00:18:45 2015 UTC,"And if they are deemed sincere...   DING DING DING! There's the problem. The state is deciding which religions get legal protections and which don't. If we want to mandate that there be headlights on buggies, everyone should have headlights on their buggies. If we want to mandate that you have to be clean-shaven in prison, you have to be clean-shaven in prison. Now adopting this philosophy means you have to repeal a boatload of laws and regulations that restrict people's behavior more than is necessary to further a compelling government interest. But that wouldn't be so bad, would it?"
Indiana,3cl5pi,silverhythm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:31:45 2015 UTC,"You aren't repealing any laws, you are providing exemptions for overly burdensome laws and regulations to someone's sincere beliefs. In Islam it is a part of their religion to grow a beard. That has been shown for centuries as a widely held, sincere belief. It's very easy to prove. Missouri was sued for that rule. The court ruled the prisoner was right. He can now grow a tightly regulated 1 inch beard. Still enough to adhere to his religion, but not so much that it interferes with the safety of the prison.   The Amish don't have to use electricity on their buggies. But they do have to use highly reflective signs on the back of their buggies and solar powered lights for night travel.   A group of Native Americans can possess a very very small amount of peyote for a specific marriage ritual.   All of these things are very good in my mind. We're a nation of freedom and if you can convince a judge or series of judges that you sincerely believe that smoking marijuana in a very specific situation brings you closer to your deity or religious enlightenment, then you should be able to do it. The Rastafarians have shown and can do just that. These people are very obviously not genuine in their beliefs."
Indiana,3cl5pi,hoosierstateofmind,6,Thu Jul 9 00:39:40 2015 UTC,"They have a case, as it is difficult to show a ""compelling governmental interest"" to deny marijuana as a part of a religious ceremony."
Indiana,3cl5pi,silkysmoothjay,4,Wed Jul 8 19:55:38 2015 UTC,"Katz, the IU law professor, said the First Church of Cannabis will have to prove it's a sincere religion, not just an excuse for users to get together and smoke.  Katz doubts Levin will be able to convince a judge that the religion is true.  ""If the past is any guide to experience, he's not going to get very far,"" Katz said.  ""That's mainly because these people, while they are nice and delightful, are from a legal perspective that I think most judges would view them as goofballs.""   They don't really have much of a case. This isn't the first time RFRA has been used to test drug laws and it has succeeded like once. In a very specific and long standing religious ceremony. These guys ""became a religion"" 3 months ago.   I know we all would love for this to be successful to varying extents, but it just isn't. Legal precedent would have to be flipped on its head. There has and always will be a compelling government interest to enforce whatever drug laws they have on the books."
Indiana,3cl5pi,hoosierstateofmind,7,Wed Jul 8 20:33:02 2015 UTC,"So the RFRA only applies to well-established, mainstream religions? Nobody interrogated the owner of Memorie's Pizza about whether or not they go to church every Sunday or pray before every meal, how do we know their beliefs are sincere and they aren't just looking for excuses to be homophobes?  Didn't the federal RFRA come about in part because niche Native American religions wanted to use peyote in their ceremonies?"
Indiana,3cl5pi,silverhythm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:03:23 2015 UTC,"Memorie's Pizza did not use the RFRA as a legal defense. The whole situation was them announcing they planned to discriminate, voluntarily closing due to outrage, and then reopening after a fundraiser. It never went to court."
Indiana,3cl5pi,NaturalSelectorX,-5,Thu Jul 9 13:21:24 2015 UTC,RFRA applies to actual religions. These people are as real of a religion as Jim Jones. And Memories Pizza didn't descriminate against anyone or anything. If they did they would have to pass the same test as these folks. They would also fail as a government has a compelling  interest in preventing discrimination.

This group can claim to be a religion, argue it in court and then a judge will decide how genuine their beliefs are.   Scientology has sued the IRS several times for a religious exemption on certain taxes. A judge has ruled on mutiple occasions that they aren't genuine in their religiosity.  A judge will rule similar in this religion that happened to become a thing during RFRA when their religious leader has been telling everyone the whole way they doing this just to fuck with the new legislation.

Indiana,3cl5pi,silverhythm,0,Wed Jul 8 23:56:25 2015 UTC,Incorrect. The Church of Satan (a widely known atheist organization) is widely recognized as a religious group by pretty much everyone but the IRS.
Indiana,3cl5pi,hoosierstateofmind,4,Thu Jul 9 00:00:07 2015 UTC,So in other words the weed church has already gotten more legal recognition than they have? I'm skeptical the courts would support their religious beliefs if it was about anything much more controversial than monuments near public buildings. Certainly not if they claimed to commit what would otherwise be a crime as part of their ceremony.

The state has to show that it has a good reason to prevent the religious practice, and that there is no reasonable alternative.

They want to do this because no pro-environmental entity in Indiana will do this.

If I'm missing something, tell me."
Indiana,3ck5yw,hansorg,2,Thu Jul 9 18:35:25 2015 UTC,"The situation, as I understand it, is that the EPA wants to fine Indiana farmers for knowingly polluting local bodies of water with their waste.   It's a lot more than just farmers. The new regulations allow the EPA to regulate ""temporary"" bodies of water. That means that overflow ponds, drainage ditches, and even bodies of water on golf courses now fall under federal authority.   Additionally, ""knowingly"" has nothing to do with it. One major concern is that drainage ditches are often shared by multiple landowners. If pollution from another field flows into your drainage ditches, you are now responsible for the pollution that flowed through your land. This will either result in lots of red tape and disputes over the legality of attributing pollution in a waterway to the owner of the land or it will force many farmers to not share drainage systems (resulting in less efficient drainage).   They want to do this because no pro-environmental entity in Indiana will do this.   That's true. IDEM isn't going to push this type of regulation anytime soon.   The people currently occupying our Statehouse are against the EPA doing this because they are more concerned with farm profits and ""states' rights"" than protecting Indiana's environment.   Everything is a trade-off. Even the most pro-environment folks recognize that. We could ban fossil fuels and significantly reduce our emissions, but that would have a significant negative economic impact.   Treating smaller bodies of water the same way as larger waterways isn't the best route in my opinion. Drainage ditches for farms are going to have higher levels of pollution from fertilizers, but when they eventually drain into larger bodies of water, the levels are below the requirements. The Army Corps of Engineers said they will work to further clarify the rules, but as it is written right now, having the same requirements for small, temporary bodies of water as larger ones doesn't make a lot of sense.   If they come back and make changes to the requirements of those bodies of water, then I think some states will back off. But I agree with Zoeller in that all bodies of water shouldn't be treated the same way by the EPA. I don't necessarily agree with him that this is a 10th amendment issue though."

Mike Pence is never going to champion ANY pro-environmental cause in the state if it would burden businesses even a few dollars per year.

How? Sustainable farming by organic and non-chemical means. All farms need to shift towards permaculture principals, companion plating, composting, and natural soil restoration. Farms will be less productive, yes, but in the long run they will produce very little waste/pollution and it will curb the dangers of large industrial farms like soil degradation, aquifer poisoning, mono-cropping, pest resistance, and so on. We have to shift towards smaller, local community farms in large numbers rather than a few huge industrial farms."

Within distance of Nashville, TN - St. Louis, MO - Indianapolis, IN - Louisville, KY. Growing tremendously each year on the East Side of town. Each side of town feels like a different area completly (West Side is way more of a country feel and East Side is more of a city feel). Tons of local favorites to try out for food, shopping, and visiting. Fall Festival every October (look up). Shrinersfest every summer. Like any city though there will be problems. 2 Colleges (University of Southern Indiana- Division 2 Athletics) (University of Evansville - Division 1 Athletics). Downtown is currently in a long debated growing process with hopes to rejuvenate the area with more life. And if you are not comfortable with a wide variety of people every day you could try Newburgh, Indiana which is a small town connected to the east side of Evansville. Beautiful place, very low crime and a little bit higher quality of life compared to places in the area. Victoria National Golf Course is right by Newburgh and it is quite the sight to see if you love golf courses beauty. And of course, you never know what kind of weather you'll get in a day- could be 90 degrees one minute then snowing the next!"

Plainfield has become the distributing hub of many shipping corporations and it's a booming suburb of Indianapolis. Meaning you can live minutes from work and minutes from more entertainment than you're exposed to in Champaign. Ex. we have professional and semi-professional sports teams, an art scene that isn't connected to some university class, etc. If you still want to get the college campus experience you're an hour from IU and an hour and 20 from West Lafayette. That and the cost of living down/over here is like 4th lowest in the country.

My guess is that they feel a more non-partisan commission will do a better job at keeping like minded individuals voting together in districts. As things currently stand there are legislators that represent say Zionsville AND communities on the Illinois border. How like minded are those folks? Likely one chunk of that population is going to get ignored. Whereas if that border territory was instead voting with a Terre Haute population they would likely get a more fair representation.   This isn't to make a comment about any particular legislator. I just looked at a district map and picked out one that stood out most.

You have to meet a population requirement for even districts and to meet that any districts in rural Indiana have to be massive. Most of his population comes from Hendricks County and Kokomo even though they are a tiny portion of the real size.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

In today's information age, your assertion would be easily contradicted with the fast and furious fiasco, or the fact that states that require drug testing for public benefits spend more on said testing than they save on denying benefits to people who would otherwise qualify. It's logical fallacy to put the interest of the state ahead of the rights and freedom of people who want to believe in Judaism consume a demonstrated beneficial product that's been in existence for thousands of years in thousands of cultures.

I understand why its worded that way.   While the general population believes people are born this way; if this law defended gay marriage on the basis that gays are born that way, it would come under much more legal fire because we haven't conclusively proven beyond a reasonable doubt that people are born gay.

Indiana,3bakl3,dirtydyno,12,Sat Jun 27 10:32:37 2015 UTC,The primary elections are always the first Tuesday in May.  May 3rd 2016 is our next primary election.  Not really hidden...not really.  It's been this date for decades.  In the primary you'll find many many democrats and republicans alike running unopposed...you need to not only vote but you need to run against them.
Indiana,3bakl3,Besca,7,Sat Jun 27 13:36:04 2015 UTC,"The primary is not hidden, what the fuck are you going on about?  The primary election is always the same time every year. It is the first Tuesday after the first Monday of May.  Voting locations are not mysterious, either.  You can look up your voting location quite easily at this link  You wrote all that bullshit on your post, yet you didn't provide any useful information.  Everything you need to know about voting in Indiana is at this website:  https://indianavoters.in.gov  (thanks, big government! lol)"
Indiana,3bakl3,woohoo,-6,Sat Jun 27 15:00:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for making my point!   ""The first Tuesday after the first Monday of May"" ... That's actually pretty cryptic, and that website is about the only place your going to see it publicized.   The only date on the calender that is more cryptic is Easter, but it uses lunar cycles.  But, wait a minute some years there is a primary and some years not?     I know this, but do most people in this state?   People busy with jobs and families?  I sometimes lose track of these things.  Do a survey of the people around you, do they know?  Whats wrong with the first Saturday in May?  Why do we have to play weird games to put it in the middle of the week on some indeterminate day in may?  What is the purpose of this?  The only purpose I see is to make people forget about when it is?  On top of that you better figure out how to get down to the polling station while working and picking up kids before the daycare closes.  Indiana has the shortest polling hours in the country.  And, yes often polling stations are hidden/moved around.  Especially if you live near some college campuses.  They put a sign on mine ... er uh during the primary, which I missed!  Not during the general election when I showed up.  I voted in every presidential election since I was eligible, in 1988.  If someone like me gets disenfranchised how many others did.  Had to get to work though no time to look at websites and make calls.  If you don't think these shenanigans are going on just look at the congressional district gerrymandering for Franklin college."
Indiana,3bakl3,Besca,2,Sat Jun 27 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"Indiana polls are open 6AM to 6PM...and if you can't make it during those hours you can fill out a paper absentee ballot way before the election.

On top of that you better figure out how to get down to the polling station while working and picking up kids before the daycare closes.    Sure, the state could do more to help people vote, like these other states do. But you have 5 months to figure it out before the next election.  Not to mention early voting and absentee voting http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/2402.htm   And, yes often polling stations are hidden/moved around.   NO, the locations are NOT hidden.

I was making minimum wage, but was forced to pay Union dues, Union initiation fees, etc.    None of us minimum wage guys had any interest whatsoever in joining the union. I mean, we were being paid the lowest amount it was legal to pay someone in the United States.  What the hell were we getting for our money?  Anyway, we'd all put off joining the union until they forced us to do it. Then they'd deduct Union dues, Union back dues, and Union initiation fees from our checks.

You have no recourse if the employer decides that NONE is reasonable.

Indiana,3b6vzi,mbarnar,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:22:49 2015 UTC,It isn't states rights really. It is economics. There are significant trade offs for carbon neutrality. It isn't that they hate the environment. It is more that they hate the Great Depression.   Now great depression is hyperbolic but you get what I'm saying. This is about what is an acceptable trade off to clean up our production methods.

Indiana,3b6vzi,mbarnar,0,Fri Jun 26 14:34:48 2015 UTC,"A pretty great economic argument can be made for environmentalism in the long run. It's easy to look at the immediate results of reducing carbon emissions and ignore the long term consequences of inaction.  Alternative energy is an inevitable trend.

Indiana,3b6vzi,MrFordization,-1,Fri Jun 26 15:15:30 2015 UTC,"We have to start somewhere. As a species we are heavily investing in alternative energy technology. All environmental concerns aside using a mix of alternative energies of all variety is objectively superior to burning fossil fuels. For one very clear thing there is no heavy, dirty, and expensive transportation from an expensive and dirty mining site to a production facility. We can keep the mess contained at the production facility.  The crucial factors right now are the related rates. Dollars per watt-hour, volume of coal/oil per watt-hour, surface area of solar panel per watt-hour, cost of facility maintenance and capital per watt-hour, these kinds of things. We are closing the gap on these rates and it is reasonable to assume that these alternative technologies will be more cost effective than traditional methods in the near future.  We are already seeing Asia surpass our productive capacities in an alarming number of ways. If we don't jump on this technology we could easily be to the twenty-first century what the Soviet Union was in the twentieth: a dangerous superpower with lower than average quality of life and backward technology with leaders claiming it is the best in the world.  If we want to maintain our tradition of being the best country in the world we must take big risks on new ideas.  -Another good question, how does the rate of carbon taxation relate to the rate of government subsidy for fossil fuels?

Indiana,3b6vzi,MrFordization,0,Fri Jun 26 16:18:45 2015 UTC,"There is very clear collected data that the earth is warming at an alarming rate. Yes, it is true that the earth has varied in temperatures for billions of years. What is alarming about the data the scientific community has collected over the last one hundred years is that the delta temperature is crazy off the charts. The change is happening too fast.  Any change that is too fast has the potential for destructive results, which is basically the heart of your argument against accelerating the change in our energy production.  Believe what you want about the consensus in the scientific community - if we don't develop and adopt new technologies we will be left behind. Alternative energies are economically better than burning fossil fuels. Anyone who argues otherwise is under a delusion that economics is all about the bottom line on a business ledger. The opportunity cost in dangerous labor alone is ridiculous. Moreover petroleum products are finite. You can argue all day about how we can have alternatives ready by the time it runs out... but what happens to our production of plastics?   There are so many reasons to support alternative energy that has nothing to do with buying into the climate change."

I depend on what common sense tells me. The sun is the largest, most powerful source of energy in our region of space. It is therefore logical that we should develop technology to harness and utilize that power.  Wind has been used to power things since before electricity. It's an obvious choice. The water at my parents house has been heated with geothermal energy for a decade now and has saved a considerable amount in energy cost.  I don't think the changes climate scientist are urging are bad. It's hard to see them as bad unless you pity the oil or coal industries. We didn't pity the typewriter when the computer came along.

You can stay on you parents insurance until you are 26, instead or getting kicked off at 18 or when you leave college. Do you need immunizations, birth control, or any kind or preventative testing like blood pressure checks or cancer screening? You can get all those on your regular insurance with no copay. All this happened when the law passed. Maybe you didn't notice. So even if you don't need the subsidies, and you have regular insurance, the law is already helping YOU and bringing down the deficit of our country, which was skyrocketing due to healthcare costs. These are now coming down. If states like Indiana would accept the federal subsidies and expand Medicaid, more people would be covered, and it would economically help the State. But many Governors, like Pence, refuse to do so for no good reason, and it is costing people's lives."

I believe that when the law was originally written that the federal government thought that more states would jump on the exchange band wagon in which this case would have been moot. After the large number of states did not set up their own exchanges they should have amended the law to include those that were insured under the federal exchange. But they had to ""Pass the bill so you could see what was in it"", and they passed it without fully understanding what they passed. If more time would have gone into a comprehensive overhaul of the system, not putting lipstick on a pig, I think we wouldn't be in the situation we are in.   I believe that for the healthcare system in this country to truly be on the side of right insurance needs to go away. It is because medical facilities and insurance companies have colluded that the prices have gone up. By breaking up this price gouging ring people would be able to afford the medical care they need with little to no assistance from third parties.    I'm not letting Brown and Scalia off the hook.

Other than that, I tried two other times to start a conversation, both of them failing.  3) Ivy Tech  The college I'll be attending. I go there to use their precious precious internet (currently on my phone). I try and sit next to people when I can, but they all seem to be in their own world, and I have found no opportunities to jump in. I introduced myself to one girl once that was having trouble with her laptop. I build computers, and I offered to help her, but she declined and then left shortly after.  4) Librarys  Started a conversation with a pretty cool guy, but he looked about 30 years older than me, so I don't think that really counts. Most people in the public library here look like they just got off a really bad cocain trip anyway, so maybe I'll avoid that...  There was one girl I wish I talked to though...she was reading Catcher in the Rye, and I could have said something about that, but my sister was with me and wanted to leave so I didn't get the chance. Too bad, too.  5) Gym  No luck, everyone there looks like they are about to break me and half and feed me to their pet pitt bull.

You'll definitely scare some people away but you're already at zero friends, so what do you have to lose?    28 moves?  is that a military thing?  I was in the military and definitely noticed the change in atmosphere when I moved back to Indiana.  Everyone here already has friends, so they're not too eager to add another.

There used to be a festival in Muncie where I would fly called Summer Heat, and I know of pilots in Anderson and New Castle as well, though the sport is dying in Indiana as it gets more difficult to find sponsors.  The $250-300 per person should get you about 45 minutes to an hour in the air, and honestly covers fuel and vehicle costs.  That's not a bad price at all.  Angola is a good festival and if you want a tethered flight, they are usually 10-25 per person, and it's just up and down for a few minutes.  Still neat. You can also always contact a pilot and see if they would exchange some crew help for a ride.

Indiana certainly could produce more power by solar--specifically, since we are #1 in manufacturing as a percent of our economy, there are certainly a lot of manufacturing plants and warehouses that should have rooftop solar arrays, and the state should be encouraging that--but we are 13th in the country for wind, which is not too shabby.  http://www.awea.org/resources/statefactsheets.aspx?itemnumber=890"

Seems to me though, that we Hoosiers used to pride ourselves on our willingness to embrace new businesses and technologies.   I don't know a whole lot about the legislation that is being discussed, but it seems to me that perhaps we could look at funding other methods of energy production and looking at reducing our reliance on coal in the long term. Say like over the next couple decades."
Indiana,3azjr8,dreckmal,-2,Thu Jun 25 01:06:03 2015 UTC,"We are embracing new businesses and technology. We're the 2nd state per capita in the usage of solar energy. Just because there are new options doesn't mean we should throw pragmatism out the window. We can't just say, ""yep fuck coal and throw out the 10,000 jobs that go with it."" In some areas of the state, the only well paying jobs are that of coal miners. Whole families greatly depend on that industry and these aren't places that will just have someone else come in and fill the niche. If coal is gone, whole communities will be forced to uproot and move somewhere else.   Add in the fact that these EPA regulations are a step above regulations that were put in place several years ago and have yet to be implemented and you see where opposing such regulation becomes not only an option but a pragmatic one.   In an analogy, let's say in 1995 the recommended number of steps per day (it seems everyone has some sort of fit bit anymore) was 6,000. It is mandatory that you walk those 6,000 steps a day. Then the EPA comes along and says, our study shows it should be more like 10,000. Everyone goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's nearly a 70% increase in mandatory steps. Someone sues and it is being fought out in court. While that court battle is happening the EPA comes back and says, now it is a mandatory 14,000 steps. Do you see where that is a problem? We're not even sure the previous increase was deemed appropriate by anyone other than the EPA at this point and they're coming back and essentially enacting a 120% increase on what our current standard of 6,000 steps are. If I were a politician whose state relied heavily on coal production to employ a large swath of my people, I'd call shenanigans too.   There is zero pragmatism in what the EPA is doing with these new standards. And everyone in southern Indiana has a brother, or an uncle or a friend who would lose their job under these new EPA standards.   Edit: To give a little more of a real life feel to this scenario. The town of Linton, which was founded in 1831, is almost entirely based on the existence of coal mining. These EPA regulations would shut down their coal mines. 5000+ people would either have to completely migrate to somewhere else in the state or live in dirt poor poverty conditions. Switz City, Worthington, Sullivan a town of 20,000 would be cut in half, Bicknell, Owensville, Oakland City, Petersburg, Bloomfield, Carlisle, Dugger all names of towns that would, if not be wiped off the map, become shells of their former selves. I would imagine many would become drug havens."

I'm not personally invested in the topic specifically, and am with you that we should work very hard towards reducing the need for coal. It's a lot more than just should we pollute like crazy or not. We're talking about thousands of lives here in Indiana and hundreds of thousands in the United States. There has to be some trade off, give and take. Even if it was technologically feasible to stop using coal yesterday, it would likely be a very poor policy decision to do so.

They are literally arguing that abandoned properties in other communities have a valid basis for assessing the taxable value of properties elsewhere that are in thriving communities.  If that's true, why not base the taxable assessment of suburban Indy properties based on suburban Gary/FW/South Bend/etc properties?  edit: /u/woohoo reply is also the strawman fallacy because I never suggested that businesses like Meijer weren't being taxed on corporate income like every other Indiana corporation.  My point is that they are manipulating the tax system to argue that their properties are less valuable than they are in reality - they want to pay the tax rates of a ""thriving"" property based on the value of ""abandoned"" properties, and that is bullshit.

Indiana,3awk44,PAJW,2,Wed Jun 24 12:23:47 2015 UTC,"IC 6-1.1-31-6(c) provides that ""with respect to the assessment of real property, true tax value does not mean fair market value.  Subject to this article, true tax value is the value determined under the rules of the Department of Local Government Finance"".   True tax value shall mean market value-in-use, which is defined as follows:  The market value-in-use of a property for its current use, as reflected by the utility ceived by the owner or by a similar user, from the property.  True tax value may be considered as the price that would induce the owner to sell the real property, and the price at which the buyer would purchase the real property for a continuation of use of the property for its current use.  In markets in which sales are not representative of the utility to the owner, either because the utility derived is higher than indicated sales prices, or in markets where owners are motivated by non-market factors such as the maintenance of a farming lifestyle even in the face of a higher use value for some other purpose, true tax value will not equal value-in-exchange.  The market value-in-use standard includes a market value-in-exchange component in markets where there are regular exchanges for the current use.  Sooo, what Meijer and Walmart are arguing is that what they have is a big, cheap building with florescent lights, tile floors, very few partition walls, and limited bathroom facilities.  Which is correct, the construction costs and depreciation of their buildings means they are not extremely valuable by themselves.  If the big-box owner leaves (like many KMarts), the next buyer is probably another bigbox, who will do an extensive and expensive remodel.  I am not sold on the ""dark store"" theory because those vacated stores are not in locations economically feasible for big-box retail, whereas current stores are in economically feasible areas.  In the cases where shuttered stores are bought by another, the remodel costs approach the costs of a new store.  Where the assessors are probably missing the value is the land.  The concrete and wire and all of that is not very valuable, but a busy bigbox site in a good area is."

We might see some shenanigans in a few states, but by and large I think many people are going to realize they were on the losing end of history and that continuing to take that stance reflects poorly on their other objectives.   If we were to see some shenanigans, this is what I expect:   Adoption restrictions. Things like allowing adoption organizations to deny placement because to same sex couples, possibly direct attempts to bar same sex couples from adopting. This issue has already come up some in a few states, and it will eventually make its way into the courts when someone manages to pass it. I would keep an eye on some of the Southern and ultra conservative states for this issue. I don't see this becoming law in Indiana, but it wouldn't surprise me to see it proposed at some point.  Discrimination/RFRA laws. Unfortunately, I think we got to be the whipping boy here, so I wouldn't expect this to be an ongoing thing.  Court cases to deny same sex spouses benefits.

None of these are necessary for the safe performance of an abortion, but it severely limits the doctors and facilities that can perform them.

Indiana limestone was used extensively in rebuilding Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire. Built in 1959, the architecturally significant St. Augustine's Episcopal Church uses Indiana limestone in the interior. New Yankee Stadium in The Bronx, New York, opened in 2009, extensively uses Indiana limestone paneling on its exterior facade. The original 1930s buildings of Rockefeller Center use limestone from Bedford. In 1955 the Tennessee State Capitol exterior was renovated using Indiana limestone to replace the poorer quality Tennessee limestone that had started to deteriorate. Indiana limestone has been particularly popular for the construction of university buildings in the Midwest. The Neo-Gothic campus of the University of Chicago is almost entirely constructed out of Bedford, Indiana limestone; in keeping with the trend of post-Fire buildings using the material. The campus of Washington University in St. Louis, both new construction and its original buildings, makes use of Indiana limestone (along with Missouri Red Granite) in its collegiate gothic architecture. The majority of Indiana University, Bloomington was constructed out of limestone. In addition, many buildings on the north side of Michigan State University use Indiana limestone. Both structures of the Kenosha County Courthouse and Jail in Kenosha, Wisconsin, were built out of the limestone. The rock was used as far north as the Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Limestone#Notable_buildings"

Indianapolis Zoo. A great zoo, and home to the world-famous International Orangutan Center. Connor Prairie Living History Museum I'm probably missing a ton of stuff. Visit Indy.   Day Two - South Central   Columbus, IN is supposed to be one of the nicest small towns in America, and the whole city is basically a world-renowned architectural museum. Anyone who studies architecture knows Columbus. While you're there, visit the restored Zaharakos Ice Cream Parlor and see their player piano. Brown County State Park & Nashville, IN. Beautiful views and an artsy, folksy town catering to Brown County visitors with many locally-made food, handicrafts, art, and furniture. Bloomington. Home to Indiana University. Among the highest densities of international restaurants in the country. I like Anatolia. Dalai Lama's brother lived there (recently deceased), was an IU professor, and established the Tibetan Cultural Center to preserve the culture of the Tibetan people.   Day Three - Southwest  Somebody help me out, here, because I don't know much outside of Central Indiana.   Vincennes. It's the first city in the state of Indiana. It has a lot of history, and even hosts a national park, of sorts. You can visit the mansion of Governor and President William Henry Harrison. It was also the first brick house in Indiana and the center of government of the Indiana Territory. Evansville. The major city in southwest Indiana, and on the banks of the Ohio River. Home to some of the best schools and libraries in the world. Evansville is really a vibrant city with a rich history, but I don't really know much about it. You'd do well to ask around on reddit about things to do, there. New Harmony, IN. Host of several weird utopian communes in the 1800's. Interestingly, New Harmony was immensely important to American history. Among other things, this town, and its people, were absolutely instrumental to the foundations of American geology, the founding of the Smithsonian Institute, public schools, trade schools, libraries, and more.

I've done a lot of barn weddings, and they seem like they have gotten more popular in the past couple of years. None of the barn weddings I have ever been to have been even 1% as classy as the bride tried to make it. It's a good idea, but usually the execution doesn't quite work out as planned. In my experience there are always horseflies, wasps and bees. Even if the barn itself isn't being used for animals anymore, you can still smell it, especially if its hot out. The last barn wedding I went to there was a horse paddock behind the bride and groom with gorgeous white horses in it. It was really nice until one of them took a huge shit while the bride and groom had their first kiss and everybody started laughing.  If you have a barn wedding, I'd recommend a place where all the farm stuff is just for looks and it isn't actually being used for animals or crops or anything anymore."

In all honesty the protection from a tyrannical government probably isn't the most effective argument for the second amendment, but it does serve as somewhat of a deterrence to dickbaggery. As the Japanese said, You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass. That somewhat applies to some sort of government resistance.   But truly the best argument for the second amendment, especially here in Indiana is the fact that the cops aren't showing up until it is too late. And that is assuming you have the opportunity to dial 911 first. The likelihood someone kicks in my door in the middle of the night is low.

Indiana,39z28g,elight86,0,Fri Jun 19 14:18:31 2015 UTC,"5.56 is much less likely to overpenetrate than buckshot, or even handgun rounds. The AR platform is also more compact, and there's very little recoil. Plus, you get 30 rounds in the magazine, instead of 8.   There's something in the /r/guns FAQ that explains this."
Indiana,39z28g,sleeplessorion,-1,Tue Jun 16 05:51:01 2015 UTC,The ability to fire more rounds faster at your target.  A .223 has less chance at over penetrating and going through walls than 00 buck.  Reloads are a million times faster with an AR.

Seriously though, 2nd Amendment rights don't extend to black americans and the 13th Amendment allows for incarcerated slavery.

My favorite part is when arguing against them, they'll claim suicides don't count when adding up all the deaths caused by firearms.

I don't know a lot about the NRA but the claim seemed unbelievable (not outrageous, just possibly untrue) so I googled it.  Thought I would share the info.  I didn't downvote your original comment, btw.  Anyway.. I inherited a .22 rifle and a 12 gauge but I'm not really a gun enthusiast.  My 8 year old son knows that I own them and where they are locked up and I'm pretty hesitant to demonstrate how they function to him, in the same vein that I haven't shown him how to use my table saw - it's not need-to-know information for him right now.  You seem pretty thoughtful, so what would you say to that?"
Indiana,39z28g,jbrogdon,2,Tue Jun 16 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"So first of all thank you for securing them.  Kids are very curious and every time I hear about some idiot leaving a gun laying around I want to hit something.  If you have anyone in your home who shouldnt handle firarms, they should be in one of two places:  in your physical possession or in a quality safe.    Now when it comes to kids and guns, I'll restate, kids are very curious and even if they act uninterested if they can possibly get to the gun they will.  A good way to combat this is to take away the mystery.  At some appropriate age (will vary by the kid), I think it's a good idea to let them see them, handle them, and explain the benefits and dangers of firearms.  When approriate I also demonstrate what they can do when used unsafely with some melons.  Both of my kids (in their teens) are now very safe shooters themselves, but when they were younger, if they wanted to see a firearm all they had to do was ask.    You should also make sure they know what to do if they see a gun when you aren't around.  The NRA has a great program called Eddie Eagle that teaches ""Don't touch, leave the area, tell an adult.""  I have a very clear memory from when I was 7 or 8 of a friend showing me his dad's revolver while we were at his house alone.  He got it from quite high up and far back in a closet...not cool."

No? That's because blacks with guns are considered gang members and must be killed. Wow, it's almost as if the civil war never really ended."
Indiana,39z28g,Servicemaster,2,Tue Jun 16 21:56:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry that does appear to be false information.  The media is largely responsible for the false images of the majority of black Americans involving firearms (particularly gangster rap).  I know it's anecdotal but a large portion of my family is black and all but a couple of them have an Indiana LTCH and carry daily.  I may have unknowingly  passed along a flasehood but calling someone who you disagree with a racist is usually a sign that you have a really shitty basis for your argument.  Also, the black panthers did stage a pretty widely covered open carry protest, so as a matter of fact the answer to your question is yes, yes I have.  Quite frankly a LOT MORE legally armed black Americans is something I would love to see.  It's amazing how much crime evaporates when criminals find out their victims are likely to fight back."

I'm just going to eat all these downvotes because I just don't understand it. I don't understand the mindset.

Indiana,39z28g,XSVskill,-1,Tue Jun 16 23:04:31 2015 UTC,"No. A crime is no less of a crime if there is no gun involved.

I have seen this pathetic sight paddling on Prairie Creek reservoir, which receives much less farmland runoff than would the proposed Mounds Lake Reservoir.  THESTARPRESS  Plea made to reject Mounds Lake commission  The agricultural watershed upstream of Anderson has some of the highest fertilizer application rates in the U.S. Factory pig farms dispose of huge quantities of manure on these same fields. This agricultural land has drainage tiles that straight-pipe these pollutants into streams and then the White River.  Combined sewer overflows in Muncie and other towns dump sewage into the river any time it rains. Does a reservoir filled with this water sound like something you would swim in? Mounds Lake fish dinner anyone?  If you want a peek into what a future Mounds Reservoir will look like, take a trip across the Ohio border to Grand Lake St. Mary's. This reservoir also receives run-off from surrounding farmland. Fish populations in this lake are collapsing and algae in the lake are so toxic that the county health department warns against any contact with the water.  The environmental consulting firm working for the Mounds Reservoir project suggests retention dams and constructed wetlands in Delaware County could clean-up such pollutants. But these would impede drainage, increase flooding, and ruin the White River for Daleville and Yorktown.  Dam proponents tell us we need a $27 million Phase III study to determine the feasibility of this reservoir. This is a classic trick to get us to allow this process to continue. As a professor of ecology, I can say there is no doubt the proposed Mounds Lake Reservoir will be an algae-choked, silt-filled, sewer-tainted pond that will degrade the local environment.  This environmental disaster will cost at least $450 million of someone's money. The dam proponents can't say who will pay the bill. Creation of this reservoir will flood parts of Mounds State Park and destroy a dedicated state nature preserve for the first time in the history of Indiana; as if the state has so much nature left we can afford to drown some of it.  The Daleville and Yorktown councils should not even consider joining the proposed commission so they can have ""input"" to the process. If they don't join, the commission can't be formed and the $27 million for a feasibility study won't be spent. If the process is allowed to continue, proponents will just keep talking about this dumb idea louder and faster until they can convince the gullible to go along. The elected leaders of Daleville and Yorktown need to kill it now.  David C. LeBlanc, is a biology professor at Ball State University."""

We did, however, have local laws such as Indy's anti-discrimination ordinance, which could've been overridden by our original RFRA. This would have let companies (which are not all given rights by other states' RFRAs, at least until another Citizens United-esque ruling doing so) exercise religious rights by terminating employment of those suspect classes and claiming immunity under our RFRA.  If you add anti-discrimination language into the bill (as we finally did), remove the ability for RFRA to be used in employment decisions, or disallow it to be used by companies (a majority of RFRA states) then you've got something defensible. We originally did not do that, and it was well known here at the time that it was on purpose."

Brown-Forman Corp., whose brands include Jack Daniel’s and Southern Comfort, said Thursday it will spend $12 million to buy and expand an Owen County mill to make wooden staves and end pieces for bourbon barrels.  It will be the first Indiana operations for Louisville-based Brown-Forman, one of the largest wine and spirits companies in the world, the Indiana Economic Development Corp. said. The 15,000-square-foot mill, located in Spencer, will be expanded and 50 people hired to run it.  The barrels will be assembled at another location.  “As the Brown-Forman whiskey portfolio expands, we continue to look for new outlets for increased capacity,” said Greg Roshkowski, vice president and general manager at Brown-Forman. “We’re excited to develop operations in a new region as this new mill in Indiana will provide the materials we need to continue to grow the Brown-Forman brand.”  The IEDC offered Brown-Forman up to $350,000 in state tax credits if it creates the promised jobs.  Founded in 1870, Brown-Forman sells 25 wine and spirit brands. And it has a long history of barrel-making. Its original brand, Old Forester Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whisky, was America’s first bottled bourbon."

Book It! was also criticised by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) in 2007 who described it as ""one of corporate America's most insidious school-based brand promotions."" A pamphlet produced by the group argued that the program promoted junk food to a captive market, made teachers into promoters for Pizza Hut and undermined parents by making visits to the chain an integral part of bringing up their children to be literate. However, a study of the program found that participation in the program neither increased nor decreased reading motivation. The program's 25th anniversary was in 2009. The Book It! program in Australia ceased in 2002 when Pizza Hut in Australia was removing its dine-in stores as Australians opted for take away pizza instead of dine-in."

Trust me, they will stop.  In all seriousness I can't believe no one did anything, where's staff? Security? Even police?"
Indiana,395fxp,mbarnar,4,Tue Jun 9 17:43:46 2015 UTC,"In the videos I've watched, The staff notices as soon as the fight starts and goes to get help (I assume police) Many employees are not allowed, for lawsuit purposes to physically deal with altercations. Not even security at places like Disney world are permitted by management to physically restrain customers. They are told to call the police, and let them deal with it.   We can't fault the people for filming, because when the police arrive, they are going to need video as evidence in order to come to a fair ruling.   So why didn't any of the bystanders break up the fight if they aren't limited by Wal Mart's corporate policy? My reason? Fear of lawsuits. In America, absolutely dumb suits are tried and damages actually awarded all the time. What if a man tries to break of the fight and the women want to fight each other so bad, they take a swing at him. Can he hit them back? What if the kid doesn't like his mom being pulled away and she bites him in the leg? Can he shove the kid away? How hard can he push him until it's child abuse? Too many questions.  And for what? There isn't a clear victim here. Both of them seem to behaving extremely poorly... So why would anybody risk breaking up a fight for these two people, in a country where, no joke, people have successfully sued Honda for making Seatbelts too difficult to remove after accidents whilst drinking and driving.  EDIT: I mean, the biggest reason I wouldn't step in to break up a fight between these two stupid people, is because if they sue me, the jury is likely going to be filled with basically the same stupid people."

Indiana,3925o0,MrFordization,7,Mon Jun 8 23:20:57 2015 UTC,"The crazy thing about this issue is that it ultimately boils down to the philosophical question of when a fetus is a human. That is what lets each side call the other murderers or crazy. I have this problem of alarmist, hostile rhetoric talking to people about vegetarianism because nobody likes to be accused of murder.   Now sure, the state is obligated to take on unwanted babies but then all of sudden they become entitlement spending and the same people we see hounding the government to make abortion illegal are demanding entitlement spending be reduced, or eliminated. Moreover, regardless of if the money is there, adopted children, who are lucky enough to get adopted, face a whole array of psychological problems.  It would be great if we lived in a society that truly valued every single life... but our attitude toward many people shows that we only really value the ones that can carry their own weight. While that continues to be the case, the idea that orphaning a child is the story book ending alternative to abortion is farcical."

There is never a 'good' reason to murder anyone."
Indiana,3925o0,MrFordization,6,Tue Jun 9 00:17:39 2015 UTC,"I did not accuse you of wanting to cut entitlements, but you have to admit there is a large population of people that share the same perspectives.  I agree that a perfect society does not include abortion. To the point where I believe in a perfect society there is no outlawing of abortion.  We live in an imperfect society. Simply outlawing something does not erase its existence. If you truly want to end abortion you must target the human misery, the pessimism of society, and somehow expel it. Passing a law to forbid abortion is only going to contribute to the misery that perpetuates it to begin with."

Indiana,3925o0,PlasmaBurnz,-1,Tue Jun 9 15:54:17 2015 UTC,"Viable means that the child could survive outside the uterus.  Thus non-viable means that the child would die if taken from the uterus.  To say that viability somehow conveys life is nonsense.    Further, it can't be clearly defined.  It depends on the environment and available resources(like EVERY OTHER LIVING THING).  With enough technology even a blastocyst is viable outside the uterus.  We can't muff this one because we are talking about human beings.  If you are hunting and you see something moving in the bush which might be your son, you don't shoot first and ask questions later.  Caution sides with not acting.    So what would you call the dismemberment of a viable fetus?  The definition of abortion I see in the dictionary doesn't include a clause like that and applies to every deliberate termination of pregnancy."

Indiana,3925o0,PlasmaBurnz,3,Mon Jun 8 22:31:07 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who got one a couple years back.  The clinic in Pike's the only clinic in like 200 miles to offer any sort of legal services and it's unnerving seeing fanatic people foaming and frothing at the mouth, waving their signs and screaming at women who go in there. It's so bad that people have to be buzzed into the clinic from the foyer itself as a safety measure.  Not only that, but the law forces women to sit through an hour long read through of what they're about to do as a means to guilt trip them. Then they have to sign said paper work of the read through. And what's more uncomfortable is that by Indiana law they have to provide the option of showing the ultrasound of the fetus to women who are going to have an abortion.   The procedure costs half a grand out of pocket because insurance will not cover it. It's not cheap getting legal abortion services and then faced with a mob standing outside the clinic ready to dig their claws into the poor women who go to the clinic- it's more than enough to put off a lot of people from seeking the help they need.  Not only that but Indiana's littered with billboards screaming pro-birth, which only fuels the whole demonization of women who do seek safe abortion for whatever personal reason. It's none of their business what a person does or doesn't do.   The world isn't all goddamned fucking sunshine and rainbows. Having a child costs money and a woman's health. Then with the State struggling to find funding for children's programs and cuts across the board in social services and the like- there's no possible way the State can sustain its goddamned bullshit selfish Pro-Birth propaganda. You can't have your fucking cake and eat it. Yeah it sucks that women have to abort, but it's goddamned reality. I fucking hate this state's ass backwards views on women and choices.   Not everyone comes from a fucking happy go lucky supportive family. Lots of women out there don't have the fucking luxury. My friend happens to be one of many in a situation without a family and not many friends to fall back on if shit hits the fan. Life happens, shit happens. We deal with it. A woman can always have children when she's in a better situation- but a dead woman can't contribute to shit and a baby sure as hell can't until it turns 18."

He had no victim profile, thus making him so hard to find. He didn't target girls of any size or age of features The only recepit for your ""area"" is the car rental in Chicago/Notheren Indiana and the toll road. Since we know for a fact he drove to New York before Vermont I don't know how you can take that as ""evidence"" of him being in Bloomington since I90 is the fastest way to New York from Chicago and you have to go through the Indiana toll to get there. There are no reports of a victim of his ""escaping"". The next victim of his after the VT couple was Samantha Koening, who was 5'4/140lbs/brown hair and brown eyes.....Lauren was 5'0/90lb/blue hair and eyes."

Indiana,38g7rv,jccalhoun,4,Mon Jun 8 19:05:46 2015 UTC,"There's several things I recall reading. I can just find a few pieces without going into a long drawn out search. But here's a quick summary.  *On June 2nd he flew to Chicago, rented a car and drove to Vermont to murder a couple ( Bill and Lorraine Currier) in their home. For some reason he drove down I65 towards Bloomington that night before showing up 4 days later in Vermont to murder 2 other people.    One of the most damning is probably his next victim  Samantha Koenig who was the same height, weight and could pass for a body double.    I am guessing the reason they haven't found her body is because they're looking locally. The three boys in question couldn't have killed her and hid her body well enough to not be found for 4 years. Impossible, not in that short of a time. Israel Keyes dumped her body a few hundred miles away in a spot he had prepared years or months prior. He planned 2 years ahead to murder someone in Vermont and even stashed a murder kit.   It's just my theory, no one else seems to connect the dots so I'm probably wrong. I've just never seen otherwise and everything I read points to him."

You may have guessed 41, but that's second to.... I65.   Where was he between 6/2 and 6/5? In Indiana at least for a portion of  that time.   could he have Drove from Chicago to Bloomington, found her drunk, kidnapped and killed Lauren, then drove to Vermont in 3 days? Absolutely. When he killed the couple in VT he had a murder kit he had hid a few years prior. He was flew into Indianapolis in 2007, drove 550 miles in 2 weeks, then went home. Maybe he hid one of his many murder kits then for a Bloomington murder.   Again, if there was absolute proof it wouldn't be a theory. So it's just that, a theory."

Fastest way to Indy is I-65...you're at least 2.5 hours from Bloomington by the time you come around I-465, and get on SR 37 South.  Bloomington is about 40 miles from I-65.  But I see what you're saying..."
Indiana,38g7rv,Besca,4,Fri Jun 5 20:30:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, on the south side. On the north side of Indy, where he had receipts 65 is the fastest.

Indiana,38d3do,amarokstar,15,Wed Jun 3 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"My favorite one so far.    M Dwane Kinnett, if you are correct, then Bruce cannot receive the award, as he no longer exists. Caitlyn, the new entity who in effect killed Bruce, has not even gotten a participation ribbon at a track meet, and has contributed nothing to the field of athletics. Lauren, on the other hand, was a standout high school player, and for too short a time, a college athlete.   That some crazy mental gymnastics."
Indiana,38d3do,amarokstar,4,Wed Jun 3 23:35:45 2015 UTC,That is incredible...
Indiana,38d3do,strbx,14,Wed Jun 3 23:37:55 2015 UTC,"My first thought, ""Why not both?"" was addressed at the end of the article: An online petition has been started requesting Hill and Jenner receive the award  Edit: I'm transgender. If you want to have this debate, have it with me."
Indiana,38d3do,daphnephoria,14,Wed Jun 3 16:09:23 2015 UTC,"[edit: previous deleted comment asked why Jenner deserves the award]  Because Jenner's public coming out is extremely influential for both the trans* community and the United States as a whole. By her being able to proudly state that she is a trans* woman, the trans* community gains more traction towards acceptance. Also, she is a great example for trans* youth who are afraid of coming out. Essentially, she deserves the award because she's setting an incredible example and she no doubt fought an immense amount of fear to be where she is now.   Obviously that is not to say that Lauren Hill does not deserves the award. But I think it's clear that both women exemplify what the award means."
Indiana,38d3do,strbx,4,Wed Jun 3 17:07:19 2015 UTC,"Are /u/Besca's comments being deleted by mods or is Besca deleting their own comments? Not that I agree with them, but I think when a bigot makes a hateful comment they shouldn't all of a sudden get scared and try to hide their dirt.   Jenner isn't a woman. Grab his DNA, check his cellular chromosome count...he's a man, man and always will be. If he feels better pretending to be a woman, let him, it's a free country but it's not award winning."
Indiana,38d3do,MadPinoRage,-13,Wed Jun 3 17:17:32 2015 UTC,"Why is he a bigot? His comments made no vulgur overtones, and his language was clean. He just expressed that Bruce is indeed still a man. Transgender is just changing clothes, and calling yourself by the opposite sex. What bigotry did he display? Quite honestly I think you're the bigot. He exclaimed that it's a free country and Bruce can do whatever he wants.  Just because he proclaimed that he doesn't view Bruce as a woman does not make him a bigot. Though I'm sure for defending him you'll probably call me one as well."

Indiana,38d3do,Rjp_85,2,Thu Jun 4 11:00:57 2015 UTC,"I totally accept her decisions. I have no problem with the LGBT community   I'm interested that in a previous comment thread you defended yourself against being called a bigot because you ""accept"" Jenner's transition and ""support"" the LGBT* community.   Can you explain to me how that statement of supposed support and your above comment are at all consistent with one another?"
Indiana,38d3do,strbx,-5,Thu Jun 4 12:56:03 2015 UTC,"Well I could really care less what he does.  Does acceptance mean that I have to agree? No not at all. He's a male. Plain and simple. So what are you looking for? Because the fact that he is a male, and its fact he indeed did kill a woman due to his careless driving. I can be PC and I can speak my mind. Both are tolerant, and accepting of the LGBT community. It doesn't mean I agree with it."
Indiana,38d3do,Rjp_85,6,Thu Jun 4 16:31:39 2015 UTC,"Caitlyn is not a man. She may have male characteristics, but there is a clear difference between sex and gender. And Caitlyn's gender is that of a woman. So refusing to call her by her chosen name and stating that she is a man is, in fact, bigoted in that it is being intolerant of her identity and her choices to come forth and request that people call her Caitlyn (as the Vanity Fair cover says) and refer to her with she/her pronouns."
Indiana,38d3do,strbx,-12,Thu Jun 4 16:53:21 2015 UTC,But she is a man. Caitlyn was born a male. I have no problem with the lifestyle he chose. It's still not bigotry pointing to science and saying she is a man.
Indiana,38d3do,Rjp_85,5,Wed Jun 3 23:29:19 2015 UTC,"You are correct, Caitlyn was born a male. However being male and being a woman are not mutually exclusive. Your genitals do not dictate your gender identity.   So you are incorrect when you say you are ""pointing to science and saying that she is a man."" She is and always has been a woman. Your ""science"" has no bearing on her gender identity.  Also, the bigotry in question is rooted in continuing to refuse to use both correct gender pronouns (and I notice that you actually used both ""he"" and ""she"" in your response) as well as Caitlyn's chosen name.   edit to try and help clarify: ""Male"" and ""female"" refer to biological sex (physical characteristics such as reproductive organs). ""Man"" and ""woman"" refer to gender identity (which has nothing to do with biological sex)."
Indiana,38d3do,strbx,-2,Wed Jun 3 23:45:52 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected because you are absolutely right. Man and women are gender identity. While male, and female refer to the sex of the individual.   I just don't feel as there's bigotry when someone who accepts their lifestyle doesn't believe to call someone a women when they decide to changes genders.  I might be wrong in today's PC world but I totally accept her decisions. I have no problem with the LGBT community. I just don't think its right to call someone a bigot because they used a ""he"" instead of ""she"". There's no malcontent in the message. It's just verbiage."
Indiana,38d3do,Rjp_85,4,Wed Jun 3 23:53:27 2015 UTC,"I believe the accusations of bigotry come from the explicit choice to disrespect Jenner's requests that she be called ""Caitlyn"" and that she be referred to with she/her/hers pronouns. This along with likening being trans* to 'playing dress up,' which is frankly just offensive and completely incorrect.   I won't split hairs with you about what is and is not bigotry, however I think we can all agree that choosing to so blatantly disrespect another person's wishes in such ways is rude and tactless."

Indiana,38d3do,MadPinoRage,-3,Wed Jun 3 22:20:14 2015 UTC,"Seems like a dodge to me. Just blindly calling someone a bigot you should be able to defend those positions when questioned.

Indiana,38d3do,MadPinoRage,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:00:34 2015 UTC,"Because Jenner's public coming out is extremely influential for both the trans* community and the United States as a whole. By her being able to proudly state that she is a trans* woman, the trans* community gains more traction towards acceptance   Do you think her coming out would have been as successfully with out the skin bleaching to hide the leather of a 50 year old sun baked man, the removal of the adams apple, the narrowing of the nose and addition of artificial breast tissue, all in attempt to fit the part of a ""traditional"" women?  I mean I see the argument that she deserves the award because she's a signal to the trans community that its ok to be yourself, that you don't have to hide......but is that really being yourself? Why have all the operations if this is about her accepting who she is as a person? How does having larger more symmetrical breasts or a smaller nose make her feel more complete as a person?  I guess it just seems like such a hypocritical society we live in. If Melissa Mcarthy were to have surgery to loose 150 lbs and then start showing up magazine covers talking about how much happier she is now that's she skinny and that she always knew she was a skinny girl in a fat woman's body the people applauding Jenner would be burning her in effigy about how bad of example she is to women struggling with body image.  So courage if you're born with the right parts is accepting your faults and the things about your body you'll never be able to change....but courage if you're born with the wrong parts is having the money to get the right ones.  And just to note. I have no problem with trans people. I don't understand the disorder and I never will. But they don't affect my life in anyway so its not for me to understand."
Indiana,38d3do,WorsechangethanObama,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:12:15 2015 UTC,"To answer your initial question immediately: no, I do not think that Jenner's coming out would have been so successful without adhering to society's standards of feminine beauty. I think it is safe to say that society would have been much more wary (and probably spiteful) towards a public figure coming out if they had no surgery. But these are baby steps. And this fact does not change anything about the way Jenner's coming out should be perceived or the validity of Jenner's courage.   This is because Jenner does not represent all trans* women. She only represents herself. This video does a great job of explaining that. If she feels more ""complete"" with bigger breasts and a symmetrical nose, I see no problem with it. Cis women have plastic surgery all of the time to look more like who they want to be. This is probably thanks to a brutal society's stagnant understanding of how a woman should look- but that's a conversation for another time. Basically: women that want to look the way society's likes best are allowed to want to look that way. We just have to remember that the opposite is also true.    So courage if you're born with the right parts is accepting your faults and the things about your body you'll never be able to change... but courage if you're born with the wrong parts is having the money to get the right ones.   Jenner is not brave for having enough money to buy surgeries. Jenner is brave for coming out to the world as a woman- it's as simple as that.   Many trans* women are not interested in fitting into stereotypical molds of femininity, just like there are many cis women who are not interested in the same. Masculine cis women are still women, and masculine trans* women are still women, too.  So Jenner deserves the ESPY award for being trans* and having the courage to come forth and pronounce her true identity to the world, not for undergoing however many surgeries she may have had. Had she never spent a dime on altering her appearance, then she would still deserve the award.  In summary: Her trans* identity is what matters, not her appearance."

Indiana,38b7bu,yellowspectralstar,3,Wed Jun 3 12:37:51 2015 UTC,"I want the path that will most likely end the republican party.  If Hilary gets elected most likely the republicans will put up their most conservative male candidate or a conservative woman.  In either case Hilary has it.    I obviously will vote for Bernie if he gets nominated.  But she has the money and more people know her name.  The democrats are also the only ones who care about the elderly, the poor, minorities, and the disabled.  The republican have done nothing to help the poor or needy except to tell them that friends/family, charity, and non profits should take up their needs and not the government.  To me that is the epitome of being morally bankrupt.  The day of ""Fuck you got mine""  should and will come to an end."

Indiana,38b7bu,guitarist_classical,5,Thu Jun 4 11:07:48 2015 UTC,"Again, this could be ignorant optimism (or really just frustrated with the frustration) but wouldn't it be worth at least attempting to get a candidate nominated who has substance and isn't one of those two evils?   Sure, we can always fall back to the depressing idea of electing the lesser evil but it'd be ludicrous (or just lazy) to automatically follow that philosophy instead of challenging it."

Every time I see a Hillary stickers these days I just sort of quint to make sure i'm seeing straight and shake my head. Not really disappointment in that person who is such a Hillary supporter, but more because of how obviously fucked up it is that we're going to have a Bush vs. Clinton election .. again"
Indiana,38b7bu,Effability,-4,Thu Jun 4 00:57:34 2015 UTC,"The entire point of Sanders' campaign is to force Hillary to tack ever so slightly to the left until the primaries are over and she shakes up the Etch-a-Sketch and reverts to being a ""centrist"" pro-business Wall Street bootlicking closet Republican.   I really do love Bernie Sanders, but he's a million years old and the Republicans are putting out a bunch of engaging (read: crazy) young/attractive people. It's suicide for the Democrats to put some geriatric white dude at the front of their party.   The Democrats need to come up with something soon, because the image of Hillary as an inevitable wealthy steamroller crushing anything and everything on her drive to the Presidency plays in to the classic Hillary stereotype that sunk her last campaign. The country sees her as a ruthless, power-hungry bitch that cares more about winning than anything. She will doom the party in 2016."

Perhaps I'm just being too optimistic about this elections, thinking voters will be attracted to ideas of substance and an honest candidate.  Bernie's age is definitely a con but I'm not so sure that him getting the nomination would guarantee a Republican victory. His ideas and practices transcend the blue/red political grouping. Would you be opposed to him getting the nomination instead of Hillary?  Because I'm right there with you, Hillary would be the doom for the Democratic ticket. Though the republican candidates are younger I have yet to see any of substance, with Rand Paul making an exception.  I'd like to see an actual President elected, I'm tired of settling for the puppet who is slightly less evil."
Indiana,38b7bu,yellowspectralstar,-1,Thu Jun 4 12:00:01 2015 UTC,This is nonsense. Hillary and Bernie's voting records are nearly identical.   A primary is merely a contest of which personality is best poised to further the party's agenda in a general election -- and that goes for both parties.

I was disarmed in the middle of a busy Subway by two cops that think they knew the law (they didn't.)  It wasn't a pleasant experience.  Best to avoid the hassle and have the LTCH on your person.  Flash it, and be on your way. You don't need to provide anything more than showing the pink paper/card.  Edit:  Here's a thread (one of many) about it on the INGO forums  http://ingunowners.com/forums/carry-issues-self-defense/374942-carry-without-ltch-card-you.html  Edit:  I want to add something to this.  IMPD has been told as of last year to no longer confront people that are carrying a firearm.  They should only ask about your license to carry when you are involved in a situation with them.  Approaching you out of the blue is supposed to no longer occur (though it does, at times.)"

Indiana,387nt5,bmxkeeler,-4,Tue Jun 2 16:00:30 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with responsibility. It's a preference. Wouldnt asking the question to begin with show that I would prefer to follow the law?

Indiana,3816h7,TheSeeker00,7,Mon Jun 1 12:31:25 2015 UTC,"I can imagine the Indiana Democratic Party being very conflicted about this. They understand that the success they have had in running for governor has come with candidates like O'Bannon and Bayh, not Ritz.   Her winning would be incredible for the party, but that's a huge gamble. Channel 8 and Abdul Hakim-Shabazz have both referenced polls showing Ritz with a lower approval rating than Pence after the RFRA controversy. If she can't get past Pence at his low point, I can't really see her having much of a chance.   In the end, I expect that she won't get the nomination. Democrats have a great chance to win back the Governor's office, and it would be crazy to throw that away with a long shot like Ritz.

Of course this is only anecdotal evidence from just a few people, but even members of her own team close to the situation are thoroughly unimpressed. She's all politics and no policy."

Indiana,3816h7,20PNP20,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:41:39 2015 UTC,She shouldn't focus on shutting them down.  That takes to much of a line in the sand stance.  If you take away state funding and made them operate like private schools then they will wither up and die.

Indiana,3816h7,Sebastion_Shaw,3,Mon Jun 1 13:46:33 2015 UTC,You're leaving out the opposing factor though. She ran against Bennett who was disliked even by Republicans. In Republicans minds (I have several friends who said this to me) they were not voting for Ritz but against Bennett. In a gubernatorial election she won't have those same Republicans in her vote total.

Even though a lot of Republicans are peeved off at Pence, in a very similar fashion as Bennett, if given the choice between him and Ritz, they're most likely taking Pence. Plus Glenda Ritz is terrible in front of a camera and if there's one thing that Pence is good at (usually, minus that RFRA debacle) is being able to work a room."

Those in the party that aren't teachers are pissed that she's going to run in this primary and then if she loses still try and be superintendent. They're already recruiting new super candidates to make sure she can't do that.
Indiana,3816h7,hoosierstateofmind,2,Mon Jun 1 13:15:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not a teacher, and I'm not pissed she's running...That makes no sense.

Indiana,3816h7,Sebastion_Shaw,0,Mon Jun 1 13:44:23 2015 UTC,"That's her intention according to the political gossip reporters. If she loses the primary she's just going to go back to the state convention and bid for the superintendent nominee again.

Running a state government likely has more similarities to running a school district/department of education than to a private sector company."

So legally speaking, yes it is enough to warrant criminal charges (put in place to deter predators from creating a system of manipulation).  But I get your point. It seems that most people that have commented so far, think that 22 year olds should be able to get 17 year olds to have sex with them.   Perhaps the law should be based more on their opinions of cases like this.     [edit] Its also important to understand what a youth shelter is.  It is a place meant to shelter kids from abuse.  Abused kids.  An adult meant to protect kids from abuse and to assist in teaching them to cope with it, engaged in a sexual act with an abused minor.  ...To be a shelter worker, in a position of power, and to consider complicating a kid's (or ""kid's"" if you think of 17 as an adult) world, is itself a crime in my opinion.

Indiana,37wvia,Metabro,1 point,Sun May 31 16:41:21 2015 UTC,"Section 63. Indiana of article  Ages of consent in North America:       The age of consent in Indiana is 16.  A close-in-age exception allows minors 14–15 years of age to legally consent to sex with a partner who is less than 18 years old.  IC 35-42-4-9 states: ""Sexual misconduct with a minor Sec. 9. (a) A person at least eighteen (18) years of age who, with a child at least fourteen (14) years of age but less than sixteen (16) years of age, performs or submits to sexual intercourse or deviate sexual conduct commits sexual misconduct with a minor, a Class C felony.""  Under certain aggravating circumstances, the offense increases to a Class B felony or to a Class A felony. The law allows the actor a defense to prosecution if the victim is currently or was previously married (the absolute minimum marriageable age in Indiana is 15), although this defense does not apply in the case of violence, threats or drugs. The law also allows a defense if the actor is within 4 years of age of the younger person and the two were in an ongoing dating/romantic relationship. This is not a close-in-age exception though, but merely a defense in court. The law also allows a mistake of age defense if the actor reasonably believed the victim was 16 or older.  The age limit rises to 18, according to IC35-42-4-7, if the actor is an adult who is the guardian, adoptive parent, adoptive grandparent, custodian, or stepparent of the minor; or a child care worker for the minor; or a military recruiter who is attempting to enlist over the minor.

Indiana,37wvia,autowikibot,2,Sun May 31 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"The entire reasoning for this law is to keep adults from getting jobs working with 16 and 17 year old teens for the purposes of hopefully engaging in sexual acts of some sort.  Too many employers today won't say or write one thing bad about a past employee, as they are too worried about getting sued for liable and/or slander.  This happens in K-12, law enforcement, etc..  All you get is ""They worked here from this time to this time.""  That is it.  A lot of these cases used to get swept under the rug because the younger person was 16 or 17, but the seducer would just go and get another job and target young adults of the same age over again.  They knew the age of consent was 16 so they would just make sure that is how old the person was.  Do we really want adults of any age purposely targeting 16 and 17 year olds who they are in a position of authority over?  I don't think it should be a felony, nor do I think one should have to necessarily register as a sex offender, but it should at least be a misdemeanor crime and one that should have mandatory reporting if discovered by another person.  Something should follow these adults around so that other employers know what their true motives might be."

Mullins  - Before the RFRA Nesbeth v. U.S. - Was prevented from asserting RFRA by trial error   Those are just the first four. The majority of the list involves cases that didn't apply the RFRA, or occurred before it was a law. The RFRA was created, in part, as a response to someone who was denied benefits because of his religious use of peyote. The law invalidates the precedence of cases before it, and creates a new test by which courts evaluate these claims."

Or is she trying to ""constructively evict"" you, i.e. make it uninhabitable so that you leave?   I think your local HUD office could at least refer you to the appropriate agency to help. As far as I know, there's not a state service that helps protect renter's rights (other than HUD), but there are usually local ones. So I would check with your city/county/township (all of them)... this could be part of code enforcement, apart of a department of development, or possibly the health department. If you are in the city of Indianapolis, then http://www.indy.gov/eGov/City/DMD/Housing/Code_Inspect/Pages/home.aspx is the place to start. Like I said, your local HUD office will be able to point you the right direction too. Lack of hot water and windows being nailed or painted shut is all code violation.   If your landlord has actually filed in court against you, take lots of pictures and write out all of your documentation, make 3 copies of all, and you don't have anything at all to worry about in court even without a lawyer.

Indiana,37cmed,hoosierstateofmind,1 point,Tue May 26 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"The difference here is that the First Church of Cannabis was approved after the law was passed, and part of getting a ""church"" or ""religious organization"" approved is to have the government go through every single one of it's sacraments and doctrines. Part of it's sacraments and doctrines are that they can smoke weed whenever they want.  The Indiana government approved that. If they don't allow it, they're violating their own governmental law."
Indiana,37cmed,Minifig81,5,Tue May 26 20:22:34 2015 UTC,Nope. The state approved the First Church of Cannabis as a non-profit  domestic corporation. It did not approve it as a recognized religion.

Indiana,37cmed,hoosierstateofmind,4,Wed May 27 01:26:40 2015 UTC,I'm a lawyer. We already had judicial precedent for RFRA. Which is why this bill was so dumb and unnecessary. We just codified what was already in existence here in the state. An unnecessary and politically messy step to gain absolutely nothing. If someone wanted to challenge the state in this manner they could have challenged that precedent for quite some time.  Edit: I'd welcome another lawyers take on this if they feel I'm off base.

That, and smoking marijuana is still illegal at the federal level, so even if Indiana state police don't do anything, the feds still might."
Indiana,37cmed,TitoTheMidget,12,Wed May 27 01:57:20 2015 UTC,"How about I make informed statements as someone who works and lives in the legal world? They're going to get arrested and the court will not uphold a RFRA defense.   There is no crazy loophole in this bill. The only difference between before the bill and after is that you can try a RFRA defense in court even if the government isn't a party to the case. This religion is not sincere, the burden of proof is on the religion to prove sincerity and there is a plenty of information out there on Bill Levin to show that the man does not sincerely view marijuana use as a religious ritual. Edit: Even if the belief is proven to be sincere, which is a long shot. It then has to be decided that this is an undue burden on that religious belief. Upholding drug laws has proven time and time again to be a viable burden on one's religious beliefs. The few cases where someone used RFRA to get away with using drugs were very small one off ceremonies where there were only 2-3 participants with a very limited quantity.   Anyone showing up to this and smoking is going to get arrested for possession and use and RFRA won't protect them. I'd advise anyone thinking about showing up to stay far away."
Indiana,37cmed,hoosierstateofmind,7,Wed May 27 11:48:02 2015 UTC,It's going to take long after July 2nd for there to come results from this. They'll have to 1) be arrested. 2) Go to court. 3) Claim religious freedom. 4) Have that claim not thrown out of court. 5) Make that argument. 6) Have that argument upheld. 7) Appealed. 8) Perhaps appealed again. 9) Upheld for good if everything goes right.   PM me sometime in late 2016.
Indiana,37cmed,hoosierstateofmind,8,Wed May 27 12:37:10 2015 UTC,"The only way no one gets arrested is if they do nothing wrong. You honestly think this state is going to let people openly taunt our laws by smoking weed out in the open in a very public manner? The point of this is to get arrested and test the law. They'll either go through with and end up with some sort of Marijuana possession and distribution citation/arrest and then the legal system will go into works. Or they'll chicken out, talk a big game, but never actually openly break the law."

Are you going to shell out 5-10k for legal defense with little prospect of winning? You will bar yourself from ever getting educational loans, several types of jobs and put a serious delay on your next year due to sitting in court constantly.  Bill Levin has enough for as much legal defense as he wants. Do you? Most of the people going are nothing more than a pawn for this guy.   This is not how laws are changed. As much as I wish it were, this is not. The media will find the one or two people behaving like assholes and focus on them. If they don't exist, the state will just put some undercover cops in to start shit. This event could be 100 lawyers and 2 crack heads and guess who the media will focus on? The crack heads.   I just can't help but picture you in a few months when a judge makes an example out of you while you're thinking ""What the fuck did I expect to happen?"". Even worse? You'll be part of the program they use to further prevent us from legalization. At some point they'll compile all the arrests they make from marijuana related ""crime"" and you'll be one of those numbers.

Yes. And tribal practices are recognized religions.   It also doesn't need to be a ""recognized"" religion; the government doesn't determine what is a legitimate religion.   Again, yes it does, for legal purposes at least. If you were right, you could get out of literally any crime by saying you did it because of your religious beliefs, and the prosecutor couldn't question that. Or, better yet, I could just claim tax exempt status as the pastor of the ""Church of TitoTheMidget."" Doesn't work that way, champ.  There's no singular entity that recognizes a given religion's legitimacy in the US, and it's largely up to each agency. For example, the Army recognizes the Church of Satan as an official religion, but the IRS does not, and Anton LeVay is not tax exempt. Getting recognized as a legitimate officiant for a marriage is generally pretty easy, getting recognized for tax exempt status is generally pretty difficult, as is offering a religious defense in court.

If you were right, you could get out of literally any crime by saying you did it because of your religious beliefs, and the prosecutor couldn't question that.   This shows me you have no idea what the RFRA actually does. It's not a pass to break the law, it's a legal test applied by the court. The state has to show that they have a compelling interest to not allow an exception, and that the interest is served by the least restrictive means. By your logic, any ""recognized"" religion would be outside of the law; they aren't.   Getting recognized as a legitimate officiant for a marriage is generally pretty easy, getting recognized for tax exempt status is generally pretty difficult, as is offering a religious defense in court.   There is a long history of the courts evaluating sincerity. The belief and person holding it are evaluated on their own.

Indiana,37ch67,unabiker,11,Tue May 26 17:59:55 2015 UTC,This is a big deal for the interstates. You get grandma going 65 in a 70 and riding right next to a semi. Holds up traffic and increases the likelihood of an accident by about 50%.

Driving down I-65, one semi in the right lane going 65, and another semi in the left lane going 66 to try and pass the semi in the right lane. 10 miles later, semi #2 finally succeeds in passing semi #1.  Makes me wish I had James Bond-style weapons mounted to the front of my car.  This law still isn't solving either scenario, though, unfortunately."
Indiana,37ch67,Clavis_Apocalypticae,7,Tue May 26 21:28:36 2015 UTC,The drivers usually don't have much control over that.  Lots of companies set governors on their vehicles that don't allow them to go any faster than that.  They'd pass faster if they could.

I let them move over and pass whenever I can.  Or you can play chicken with them when they can't see you in their blind spots.  If you're next to them long enough that they can make the decision to change lanes and you're sitting in a blind spot, then that just means you weren't passing them fast enough"
Indiana,37ch67,nerdy_redneck,3,Wed May 27 10:22:45 2015 UTC,I understand them though. Many trucks have self regulated speed limits. A company will fine a driver if he is going over say 68 miles per hour for any length of time. They have GPS systems in them to regulate that.

Indiana,37ch67,ghosttrainhobo,3,Tue May 26 23:56:45 2015 UTC,"That addresses the asshats that sit in the left lane going slower than the flow of traffic. However, I am more annoyed with everyone on 3+ lanes (like 465) constantly passing on the right  when the left is totally clear. It really  escalated after cops started ticketing tons of people in the center median (which was mostly started because of a stupid news story), like people thought they would get away with speeding in the further right lanes. It changed the whole flow of traffic. It's bullshit when you have people using those lanes for entering / exiting and there is constantly some asshole zipping around everyone on the right (oh and fuck using their signals). Left lane hogs are annoying, but so many choosing to pass on the right for no reason is dangerous. People don't expect traffic to be zipping up the right side even if they should  be watching."

The real purpose is to prevent selfish/thoughtless people from camping the left lane and holding up traffic and/or causing people to have to pass on the right.       Except as provided in subsection (c), a person who knows, or should reasonably know, that another vehicle is overtaking from the rear the vehicle that the person is operating may not continue to operate the vehicle in the left most lane.   https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/d/c/b/1/dcb1fa00/HB1305.06.ENRH.pdf       I can't tell you how many times I've been stuck in a 20 vehicle car-line, doing 10 under the limit for miles, just to find out it was because of some idiot going well under the limit and forcing people to pass on the right.      If you watch any amount of dashcam videos of car crashes, you'll notice that that scenario precedes a significant number of crashes due to unexpected stopped traffic which is harder to see since the driver is on the left while exits and stopped vehicles are very frequently on the right."

Permits and inspections take a huge chunk of investment time. What I don't see a large market for is companies handing over proprietary information and recipes. If a truck has gone to the trouble of investing in a mobile kitchen and service window, why hand that over to someone else? Food trucks already dish out a chunk of money to be in IFTA (which runs the city clusters and First Friday at the Murat) so why would they voluntarily pay a fee to have someone else cook their food? If trucks are looking for a larger customer base, go brick and mortar. Nicey Treat survived the winter, Scratchtruck should be resilient enough to make it. What am I missing??"

Followed, of course, by legal proceedings in which the ""church"" is found to be bogus for any number of reasons and therefore provides no protection from the marijuana laws. Followed, finally, by an amendment to the law specifically saying that it applies only to ""commonly and widely recognized religions.""  Think of it this way: Could someone create the Church of the Beautiful Child as a legal cover for child molestation? True, the Catholic Church operated this way for many years. But I don't think they saw their religion as a work-around of the laws they were breaking.  As you said, this won't end well.  Edit: grammar"
Indiana,371xc0,BlisterBox,2,Sun May 24 14:30:59 2015 UTC,The catholic church was never designed a legal way to get around child molestation.

Indiana,36ytl3,say592,1 point,Sun May 24 00:28:27 2015 UTC,"I live in South Bend and love it. We are centrally located, so it's easy to go to Chicago, Indy, Fort Wayne, or Lake Michigan. I live close to Notre Dame, so I have really benefitted from the development of that area and can easily bike to plenty of restaurants and shopping, as well as sporting events and things that are happening on campus. When I eventually buy a larger house, it will likely be in this same part of town. Another good contender is closer to downtown, which is really starting to revitalize.   I take issue with anyone who says there isn't anything to do, or the area is crummy. There is more of a PR problem, and people don't take the time to seek out things to do. If you actually pay attention to what is going on in the city, you won't have problems finding events and things that peak your interest. Judging by the low turnout for things though, most people don't. That's a shame, because it becomes a self perpetuating cycle, event turnout is low, event quality goes down, turnout gets lower, event is canceled. For the times you don't find something, again, Chicago, Indy, Fort Wayne, etc are all nearby."

Indiana,36lfk7,ZRX1200R,6,Wed May 20 13:05:36 2015 UTC,"Here's the abstract:  Through ethnographic methods and dataset analysis, I explain the process through which top-performing students in rural Indiana identify, apply, and choose a postsecondary institution in light of the region’s social heritage, continuing economic and population decline, and correspondingly limited educational resources—especially for high aptitude students. The interviewed students’ choices reflect a hundreds-strong dataset of their peers graduating in recent years. A vast majority of these students choose in-state institutions; their choices differ from metropolitan students particularly as the latter appear much more likely to attend elite or out-of-state institutions. College choice to top-performing rural students is a matter of matching what they desire to get out of college with a number of individual social, financial, and educational affects and limitations. College visits and an anticipation a “good fit” on a particular campus are centrally important. The factors that result in most students attending in-state institutions are, in varying degrees: ignorance of the college choice process’s intricacies, their secondary schools’ emphasis on these institutions, a strong desire to pay in-state tuition, and a discomfort of going too far from home. Patterns also exist among the few independent, intellectually engaged students who consider elite colleges and particularly religious students who consider Christian institutions."

You could also get in touch with the people who run Creme de la Crop in Valpo, they are very knowledgeable on all that.  A local service club might be a good place to start looking for volunteers."
Indiana,36dw9b,crackthecracker,2,Tue May 19 13:35:19 2015 UTC,"I don't live on the area, but that sounds like an awesome idea on many different levels.  My only question is are there any barriers that go towards planting on abandoned property?  I think if you could get enough volunteers and sell the produce and be able to be self-sustaining that the area would see huge improvements over time.    It's cool to see people trying to find ways to improve their communities. Best of luck!"
Indiana,36dw9b,l3ri,1 point,Mon May 18 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"I LOVE this idea! Everyday I drive through my neighborhood (Bates-Hendricks, Indianapolis) and see all these empty lots and even a greenhouse that has been up for sale for about 2 years now and just think look at all the places where we could have community gardens! And one random day on Google Maps, I was looking at the street view and noticed that there USED to be a giant community garden on one of the biggest vacant lots. There was a sign, so I looked them up. Apparently there used to be a group called Green Acres that had a community garden in my neighborhood. They moved to another location and I drove past but it has been abandoned. Please, keep us updated!"

Numerous parks, low crime rate, several festivals during the year, county fairgrounds hosts the county fair every late summer.  I'd be OK living there.

That begs the question: WHY WERE THERE 17?  We all knew he bred dogs and seemed to really enjoy it. He acted as if he loved his pets.   Knowing him, none of this was supposed to happen. I feel like he just let the population get out of control and wasn't willing to admit he needed help. Like I said previously, he is an incredibly lazy individual. I feel like he just lost the will to clean and care for them anymore. He just stopped giving a fuck.   His parents paid his bail, all $85,000.

Edit: And there are corporations on both sides, bigger ones on the Sunday sales/cold beer sales.  Wal Mart/Kroger/Marsh would LOVE Sunday and cold sales.  They are already open and already have the resources.  It's liquor stores and distributors that would be hurt by the move.   A politician pushing for Sunday sales won't gain many new voters, but it will definitely lose them voters."
Indiana,3564e6,isubird33,1 point,Thu May 7 15:46:19 2015 UTC,"There is NOTHING that would need to change from a distributor or liquor store perspective if the sales are passed.  Well, maybe in the actual manufacturing of said alcohol being increased, but isn't that the point of running a company like that, to have your product flying off the shelves so that you can make a profit?  There is nothing that says that Distributors would be forced to deliver on Sundays.  Make all deliveries on Saturday or Friday.  Then it is up to the stores to order the product they expect to sell over the weekend.   There is nothing that says that Liquor stores have to open on Sundays to sell their products.  Just continue to run M-Sat, no one will care, faithful customers will always be there.  The only perk I get from going to a liquor store is Cold beer.    So in order to appease all, I'd say that they allow Sunday sales of Liquor, but prevent Grocery Stores from selling it cold.  That way, liquor stores are still the only place to get cold beer M-Sat and grocery stores can increase their alcohol sales on Sunday.  Also, get rid of that BS about having to separate where the alcohol is sold in the store.  I'd much rather a parent stroll their kid through the liquor aisle than be forced to leave them alone while they go into the area (too many sickos out there these days).  That's just my 2 cents, take it how you want."

Indiana,3564e6,say592,5,Fri May 8 04:12:28 2015 UTC,"I know that, but it is still a prohibition law that is in place.  Sure liquor /grocery stores and preventing it because they don't see a profit.  But what does that have to do with the Indiana citizen that is not a part of those corporations?  Nothing.  Grocery stores would be all for it if they didn't have to create some BS area for adults only to peruse (what is this a video store from the 90's?).  Most of them already have an area for alcohol, it's just not roped off.  They wouldn't be required to hire anyone else, their major argument was the fact that the bill had them having to build an area just for alcohol (put in there by liquor store lobbyists).  IMO, if the liquor stores don't want to be open on Sundays, so be it.   Keep your doors closed, but don't punish everyone who wants to be able to buy alcohol on Sundays by preventing companies that want to be open to selling it from doing so."
Indiana,3564e6,PlasmaBurnz,0,Thu May 7 14:43:54 2015 UTC,"The grocery stores did support it until that provision was added in the last bill.  The point you are missing though is that there won't be a dramatic increase in sales. People won't be buying more alcohol just because they can buy it on Sunday. It's lot like they couldn't drink on Sunday. So if you are a liquor store, and you are closed on Sunday, someone who wants to buy will go to a big box store. It's the same sales, just spread out over the course of more days. That is more overhead, which means higher prices at liquor stores. Eventually that could lead to stores going out of business.   Now I agree, we the people want to buy on Sunday, so we should! It's just there is more to it. This will effect small business owners the most. They will absolutely lose money. Telling them to suck it up is a tough sell, and will require additional restrictions on their competitors, or loosening of restrictions for them. The approach right now has been to penalize grocery stores, but I think that is the wrong approach. We should allow liquor stores to sell more things, advertise in new ways, etc. That will get them on board."

Its the fact that if I want to drink and run out on a Sunday (maybe I had an all night bender and want to continue it?) I can't go buy it without paying some overpriced bartender.  The fact of the matter is, there is no reason why, as a consumer, I shouldn't be allowed to purchase something that is in a store 24/7.  If Kroger is open on Sunday and I want to buy a case of beer since it is on their shelves, I should be able to.  The shitty part is that liquor companies don't want grocery and convenience stores getting their business because they are already staffed for the sales and gain no more overhead (where the liquor stores would be complete opposite).  So the people whose BUSINESS it is to sell me these things doesn't want to anyway.  So guess what, I don't go there to get my alcohol anyway!"

Yes, it's fucking stupid as hell, but it's like I can't buy alcohol on Sunday?  Big fucking deal.  It could be worse, there's several states that have dry counties.  Imagine having to drive 2 counties over to buy alcohol.  I grew up in Knoxville, TN which is in a ""limited"" county; you can buy beer just about anywhere you'd expect (the local gas station chain actually has a really good selection of beer), but to buy liquor or wine you have to go to a liquor store.  On Sundays, you can only buy beer and only after 12pm.  Liquor stores cannot sell beer, only wine and liquor."

Indiana,350c65,I_Love_McRibs,2,Wed May 6 12:18:30 2015 UTC,"Carmel doesn't have $1B in debt, at least not in the terms that most people use.  if you go out and get a $100,000 mortgage on your home and someone then asks you how much debt you are carrying, how do you answer?  Do you say that you have $100,000 of debt?  Or do you add up all of your mortgage payments over the course of the loan and respond with that number?    Nearly everyone recognizes the principal owed as the amount of debt that an entity or person is carrying.  The total payments associated with retiring that principal are going to be more than that, but nobody calls that their current debt."

Austin, Indiana is a desolate little town with pretty much nothing but some old houses and trailers set up surrounded by fields. It is a tight community of rural good people. I think that the HIV outbreak is a direct result of Indiana's refusal to allow drug users clean needles and the closeness of the community. When you are a drug addict and you are sick and you have a rig and your friend does not it is common to share the needle, especially when the person is a brother or a lifelong friend.  I know how bad that is but it is the truth.  Give everyone clean needles, and set up some suboxone clinics close by and the HIV will be contained very easily."
Indiana,34xrns,FamiliarHandle,2,Wed May 6 02:53:20 2015 UTC,"No, I've never been there.

I go to IWUG and VMUG and a couple other gatherings a few times a year and I like seeing the same folks all the time, but with different name tags.  It's nice to have that many employment options.

We called the Silver Lake PD to come take care of it, and after reviewing everything, including the envelopes, they acted like they weren't even surprised.  It's a pretty big problem in Kosciusko county. Well, I mean, it's a big problem everywhere, but for a county of ~75,000 people, there were meth busts almost daily in the paper for a stretch. They're rebranding the Super 8 in Warsaw after a brief shutdown because people were buying rooms to cook on the daily.  Then there's the idiot that had a couple of one-potters out in the open on their moped at Walmart.  It's just everywhere, with occasionally tragic outcomes."
Indiana,34kf00,fistful_of_ideals,2,Sat May 2 05:21:16 2015 UTC,I remember reading about the Super 8 rebranding. Growing up in Warsaw it was hard seeing a lot of those stories in the paper daily. At least it seems like today it isn't as bad as it used to be.

Indiana,34keqh,Old1e,4,Sat May 2 03:17:01 2015 UTC,you are woefully uninformed.  It is illegal to possess a needle with intent to use narcotics and in order to buy needles you have to put your name on a registry.  No drug addict is going to do this for fear of prosecution.  Needle exchanges are not pointless they save thousands of people's health and lives every year and there is overwhelming data that supports this.  In Indiana needles are definitely not widely available.

As the Head Teacher, she has been completely locked out, and unable to carry out a large percentage of her duties.

Indiana,34e40x,FamiliarHandle,-2,Thu Apr 30 18:58:05 2015 UTC,The huge problem is this. Obamacare does not fund a lot of things for small hospitals. Haven't you noticed the huge amount of closures and buy-out of county hospitals? Medicare pays for 50-70 percent of things. Now take a small county hospital. That treatment more than likely won't be paid for. It actually comes down to money. Drug users are highly expensive to treat and little funding for county hospitals.

Indiana,34ai2u,TitoTheMidget,0,Thu Apr 30 05:46:15 2015 UTC,Being a red or blue state is only part of what makes a state strategically valuable in the electoral college.  Only 18 states have produced a President. Almost half of all the Presidents have been from 3 states.  In the last 50 years only one president has come from a state with less than 16 electoral votes and he was exceptionally presidential.
Indiana,34ai2u,MrFordization,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:09:25 2015 UTC,"This all assumes that you'll win your home state, though. Not always the case.  Also, nominee != President. As I just pointed out, the last guy the Republicans nominated was from blue state Massachusetts with 11 electoral votes. So even if a candidate from Indiana doesn't eventually win the Presidency, that doesn't preclude them from being nominated, which is what we were discussing in the first place.  I'm also dubious of your claim that Bill Clinton was ""exceptionally Presidential."" An electable candidate, yes, but he's not exactly the type of person I picture when I think ""President of the United States.""  50 years also seems like a bit of an arbitrary cutoff, as there have only been 7 Presidents in that time, and one of them was not elected at all."
Indiana,34ai2u,TitoTheMidget,1 point,Fri May 1 06:12:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to say it couldn't possibly happen for a Hoosier, it's just extraordinarily unlikely. I don't believe Pence ever had a shot at it.   You can go back farther than 50 years and see the same trend. It's not entirely arbitrary because in the 19th century the country was smaller and Indiana had much more national political presence because the population was differently distributed.  Bill Clinton has incredible, impeccable charisma, regardless of his politics he has the Jacksonian everyman appeal. Mike Pence has shown us that he is not exactly a smooth operator.  The real problem is that unlike the case of Mitt Romney, the 2016 election is looking like more of a fair fight. Romney was nominated into a race he stood little chance of winning. From the beginning polling data predicted Obama would be a second term president. Plus he had been Governor in another state so his origin state is less relevant.  There are plenty of reason why I believe a Hoosier nomination is extremely improbable, but it is just an opinion. Nobody is clairvoyant. However, history and the general national attitude toward Indiana, even before RFRA, lead me to believe that we aren't going to see a Hoosier nomination anytime soon."

When Benjamin Harrison was elected) we had 15 electoral votes and there were less total votes in the college, now we have 11. Sure we might have a fluke year like 2008 but for the most part we are dependably a red state with a shrinking number of votes and thus from the perspective of the national conventions we hold little strategic value in the electoral college. Maybe a candidate appears that is so presidential that the numbers don't make a difference, but that person was never Mike Pence."

Indiana,34ai2u,DanteEstonia,6,Thu Apr 30 15:15:55 2015 UTC,"But the pastors said the “fix” is discrimination against Christians.   That which you do to the least of thee, you do unto me. Gotta love Christians who use the faith of Christ to tear homosexuals a new one. No sanity at all, just intolerance and hate in the name of their make-believe religion. Gay rights have nothing to do with Christianity, so tired of churches trying to force their morality down the rest of the country's throat. They say the same about gay rights advocates, forgetting the basic tenets of liberty and the pursuit of happiness.   If two guys kissing hurts your liberty, you have issues...see a shrink, not a state representative."
Indiana,34ai2u,somanyroads,2,Thu Apr 30 07:48:52 2015 UTC,Mike Pence as a 1 term governor is far from assured. These guys in the articles are so crazy that the Indiana Family Institute kicked them out of their group.

Of course this is Reddit where ignorance is upvoted and the truth is buried."
Indiana,34ai2u,fw2a,3,Thu Apr 30 12:12:07 2015 UTC,I appreciate your comments and don't understand why you're down voted for your honest opinion. My question is where do you feel your's or other's freedom infringe upon the freedoms of others and how can we more find a common middle ground?
Indiana,34ai2u,reillyr,2,Thu Apr 30 00:24:33 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm not really saying that I do agree with not providing a service to anyone personally, simply that I agree you should have a right to.  What kind of middle ground is there?  You either believe the government should be able to force you to commit acts against your conscious at the point of a gun or you don't.    Do you agree with forcing doctors to provide euthanasia in states where it's legal even if they don't want to at the jeopardy of losing their medical license?  If you own a t-shirt shop and someone comes in wanting a shirt that says ""the only good nigger is a dead nigger"" on it, should you be able to refuse?  Why is it OK to refuse that and not OK to refuse to support a type of relationship you feel is detrimental to society (even if you're wrong)?  I mean your statement is pretty contradictory ""your freedom to infringe on the freedom of others""...wouldn't that mean they're infringing on MY freedom by forcing me to do something I don't want to?  Also, how is not providing someone a service infringing on their freedom?  If I refuse to help you pick up rocks in your yard, have I infringed on your freedom to do so or find someone else to help?"
Indiana,34ai2u,fw2a,4,Thu Apr 30 00:43:56 2015 UTC,"I do believe the government should be allowed to force businesses to comply with federal law  I do believe doctors should follow the best medical decisions for  patients and should not inject their own personal beliefs.  I think they should be able to object, but this is not similar as they aren't turning away a person based on age, sex, sexual orientation, race, or nationality but solely based on a vulgar request.  My point was that there is a fine line when that must be maintained between a person's freedoms and other's rights to not be infringed by the practice of those freedoms."
Indiana,34ai2u,reillyr,-4,Thu Apr 30 02:19:15 2015 UTC,"So all doctors must perform abortions?  Who is the arbiter of what is vulgar?  Why is sexual orientation elevated to the same status as race?  Can you prove it's an innate characteristic we're born with and not a choice (even if it may be a subconscious one)?  I know several gay people who would argue with you on that:  http://socialinqueery.com/2013/03/18/no-one-is-born-gay-or-straight-here-are-5-reasons-why/   So you have no problem with forcing morality at the point of a gun as long as it's YOUR morality.  That's not freedom, that's not ""tolerance"", it's despotism.  Agree with me or else."
Indiana,34ai2u,fw2a,5,Thu Apr 30 02:28:49 2015 UTC,"You have a tendency to create straw-man arguments and that doesn't really work well in a honest discussion. I am not the one making decisions on what is medically responsible, that should remain with medical boards, the Surgeon General, and others that are capable of making intelligent informed decisions. If abortion is legal and in the best interest of the patient then yes I don't feel a doctor should have the right to object based off personal choices. They can choose to not participate in that field if they don't agree with society."
Indiana,34ai2u,reillyr,-1,Thu Apr 30 02:37:07 2015 UTC,"So do you believe in freedom of religion?  Do you really have a freedom if the Government can choose where, when, and how you practice it?  It's not a straw man argument, I don't believe I've falsely portrayed anyone else's statements in mine.  I believe in freedom to the extent that practicing yours does not unduly harm others, and I believe in a strict scrutiny interpretation of harming others.    Not to completely bunny trail, but you say the decision should be made based on what is ""medically responsible"" as defined by boards and appointed bureaucrats.  What if the sole reason for the abortion is the desire of the mother to not have a child.  Sure there are good arguments that having the child will cause psychological harm to her, well if the doctor has a sincere belief that the abortion is the murder of innocent life, is her psychological well being more important than the doctors?"

Indiana,34aav1,GreenLizardHands,3,Wed Apr 29 15:51:50 2015 UTC,"I'm from the area, but have been living elsewhere for about a year and a half now. Marion is pretty nice, and small enough that biking isn't tough, though I'm not sure you could use it as a primary means of getting around. There's a greenway that runs to Sweetser on one end, and Jonesboro on the other, which is about 15 miles end to end, 30 some miles for a round trip. There's also a path along the river that you can walk or ride, which goes from just near the town square to the main park.  There are really nice neighborhoods (Shady Hills and Shady Hills Estates, for example), but there are also neighborhoods that aren't all that nice.   There are some really good local restaurants. If you like Mexican food, Casa Brava and La Chareada are the stuff of legends. There's also a small Sushi place (I'm assuming it's still there, haven't been in awhile). There is also Payne's Frozen Custard, which is great. And Ivanhoe's isn't too far away. There used to be a place on the river called ""The Mill"" (because it's in what used to be the old mill), and it was nice, but I'm not sure if they're still open or not. I believe so. If you're willing to drive out to Converse (~20 minutes), they've got a great BBQ place (or at least did a year ago). It's also got your standard chain fast food places (McDonalds, Hardees, Wendys, Burger King, Rally's, Culver's, Taco Bell, Fazolli's, Jimmy Johns), and a couple chain dine-in places (Cracker Barrel, Pizza Hut, Steak'n'Shake, Buffalo Wild Wings, Moe's). I'm sure I'm missing some things, but that's all I can remember off the top of my head.  There are a few bars, but I would pretty much just go to Buffalo Wild Wings on Wednesday (which is their pint night). There's also Folkie's, Good Time Charlie's, and a couple of places in ""the village"" (the area around the intersection of 30th street and washington street). For the most part, I'd classify these as sort of ""working class"" or ""blue collar"" bars, but since Marion is a factory town, that's what you get. Since the college is a Christian college with a fairly strict no drinking policy, there aren't really college bars. There used to be a place called Beatnik's that was a bar and music venue, but I'm not sure if it's still open or not. There are a couple local coffee places as well, some of which are pretty good, apparently. There's also a Starbucks if you just want that.   There's a pretty big park with playgrounds for kids, and wide open grassy areas that you can use for picnics or frisbee or whatever. They have tennis courts, and a few baseball diamonds. I don't think they have basketball courts, but I might just not be remembering them. There are a couple of golf courses in the area too, if that's your thing (Arbor Trace and Shady Hills are the ones I'm thinking of).   One of the nice things about Marion is that it's near a lot of other things. You're only 40 minutes from Kokomo, about an hour from Indianapolis, about an hour from Muncie, and about an hour from Fort Wayne. So it's easy to do day trips on the weekends, and there are lots of options for where to go when you do.  If you've got specific questions, let me know."
Indiana,34aav1,twisted_bass_man,2,Wed Apr 29 20:48:49 2015 UTC,"I think a little bit of this is going to depend on what you're currently used to. I'm from an area south of Marion.  My Chicago friends really find the Anderson and Muncie areas completely unlivable because they are spoiled by the boutique food and constant new places to visit where they're from.  However, if you're from another small city, you might find Muncie has an edge over Anderson.  There's a lot of youth there, so I don't know if it's perfect for professionals.  I've only spent a little time in Ft Wayne, so I can't really speak to it.  Best of luck with your move."

Especially since there are accident-related closings on I-69 ALL THE TIME.    AND they're getting ready to start what looks like a rather lengthy repaving project soon, too.

In fact, as soon as that religious freedom thing was enacted, muncie put nondiscriminatory ordinances in place. We have a great farmers market, nice parks, a very long rail trail and a river trail as well.

Small towns in the area will be walkable/bikable and many will have nicer neighborhoods you could move too, but restaurant choices will be limited and you'd have to drive to a nearby large city to find any sort of night life."

It's a little bit of a drive, but basically a straight shot down 69, so it's an easy one. Rent in Muncie is pretty cheap, too (at least compared to where I live now-Valpo) since it's a college town.  The downtown community in Muncie has a lot to offer, in my opinion. You just have to know where to look sometimes. Lots of bars, too. The Herot is an awesome bar downtown with more beers than you can imagine."

Walnut is perpendicular to the streets between Washington and Main if that helps."
Indiana,34aav1,isubird33,2,Thu Apr 30 00:09:45 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Downtown Muncie as well, and it's nice. Easy to walk to the downtown bars if you live less than a few blocks away. A lot of the bars on the north side of the river are ""college bars"", which people out of college will probably want to steer clear of. But the Heorot and Savages and the Fickle Peach are all good. Craft Beer is easy to find in the area, and pretty cheap compared to living in a lot of other places. They are building a hotel downtown now, and there will be a Three Wise Men brewery opening up there. So you will be able to walk to get growler fills.   A few good local places to eat, as well. Casa Del Sol is the local Mexican place, which is passable, but it's no La Chas or Casa Brava (both located in Marion). Amazing Joe's is a great burger/steak place. There's a Scotty's Brewhouse, which I personally like, but I have friends that think it's just okay. All your standard chain places, plus some rarer things like Chik-Fil-A, Firehouse Subs, Panda Express. If you do cooking at home, there is a local butcher shop called Lahody's that is really great for steaks (and probably other things too).   One downside to living downtown is the trains. You get used to it after a few months, and I think they're working on getting a ""quiet zone"" ordinance or something (so trains have to go slowly and can't use their air horns in town), but as of a week ago I can confirm that this hasn't gone through. Like I said though, you get used to it.   As for what Downtown is, here's ""the passing of the Buffalo"", which is a statue that pretty much marks the southern edge of downtown. If you go east or west two blocks, and north all the way to the river, I'd call that downtown (as well as the surrounding area, north of the train tracks). But most of the businesses in the area are in the rectangle with Charles as the southern edge, Washington as the northern edge, and High Street and Mulberry as the West and East edges, respectively."

From http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1307729/pdf/pubhealthrep00030-0079.pdf   Despite high levels of knowledge about risk, multiperson use of needles and syringes is due primarily to fear of arrest and incarceration for violation of drug paraphernalia laws and ordinances that prohibit manufacture, sale, distribution, or possession of equipment and materials intended to be used with narcotics.    and from http://www-hsc.usc.edu/~tvalente/Publications/Valente_etal_JUH.pdf   In 1992, Connecticut changed the state laws to permit sale and possession of up to 10 syringes at a time. The CDC, in conjunction with the state of Connecticut, conducted initial studies that examined whether IDUs utilized pharmacies and discovered that they did. The CDC and the state of Connecticut then examined how pharmacy utilization affected needle-sharing behaviors in the two samples of IDUs that were interviewed: 52% reported sharing needles before the law changed, and 31% did so after the law changed.   From http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3456352/pdf/11524_2006_Article_31.pdf   Secondary exchange occurs when a network of IDUs sends one person to the NEP to get needles for the group. The disadvantage to secondary exchange is that only the index person develops sustained contact with the NEP and access to the ancillary services it provides. Moreover, the information received at the NEP by the index person is not reinforced by other nonattending network members. If network members take turns attending the NEP, it dilutes the effect of individual contacts. These disadvantages are further exacerbated by satellite exchange.   Basically, all of the articles that you provided address the struggles of attracting target populations. I don't have time to read all of them, but I'm very confident you will find similar discussions in each."

In the case of Lauren Spierer that was because she had parents with a lot of money and an intense desire for their daughter to be found. It's no mystery why her case got attention for so long even if the student body had a reasonable guess as to what happened. I'm sure the police had the same guess, but without a body the parents still wanted closure which they never got."

I do websites, SEO, and content marketing for a living, and I will gladly comp him several hours of my time so that he can associate his business and his personal views.  My thoughts are that if he is given a platform, one of two things will happen.  Either those who agree with him will flock to pay him for his work, in which case he is rewarded for his righteousness and leftist me is wrong; Or, he will lose business as a result of expressing those views.  I'm willing to take the chance and give him a freebie because I think the market will decide whether his type survives in the long term.  I extend the same offer to other Indiana businesses who believe their personal views are relevant to their business or their choices of whom to serve: I will donate my time and energy in order to allow you to express your views on a wider arena.  If you want to be a ""Christian Indiana business"" or a ""straight only Indiana business,"" I will gladly help you get there.  I believe that by giving someone this platform, I will engender dialogue and maybe even a bit of respect, and in the long term either I or the business owner will be absolutely proven to be correct.  I also don't think for a second that the business owner in question is willing to associate his opinion on a properly marketed website, because he is (right or wrong) in the minority by far.    Disclaimer: This offer is good for the first business owner willing to express a right or far right opinion as to who they serve, or to associate their personal feelings at length with their business.  One offer is available, at a maximum of twenty hours of my time, this offer has no cash value.  Either you walk away a hero, like Memories Pizza is to many people, or you get a boycott for expressing your opinion - I make no guarantees as to results, but if you're willing to make that gamble I'm willing to help you up the stakes.  Full disclosure: I don't give a damn who you marry, have sex with, or associate with.  But I believe in the First Amendment and I'm happy to give you a platform if you're willing to take the risk.  I'm left of center, at least for Indiana, but I respect and am happy to amplify the views of anyone willing to step up to this challenge.  Both David Duke and Malcom X are hate-filled and largely wrong.  But neither deserves to have their opinion pushed under a rug.  My personal opinions are irrelevant - if a few thousand words of content opens dialogue or encourages people to think about the politics of our fair state and what a mess those politics are, I'm entirely OK with writing it.  In the unlikely even that more than one person wants to take me up on this offer, I will consider a heavily discounted rate for additional takers.  Only one freebie is available, though.  Who's going to step up to the plate and irrevocably tie their business to their personal views?"

Indiana,33f1l7,nsdwight,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:54:26 2015 UTC,"That is actually incorrect. Generally speaking, courts agree that suspicion-less drug testing is unconstitutional under the 4th Amendment with the exception of government employees who meet some special job requirements (e.g. public safety positions). Since there is no evidence that backs up claims about individuals on welfare using drugs at a greater rate than the general population (there is actually studies that point to the opposite), there is no reason to have suspicion that the general welfare applicant is using drugs. It just perpetuates the stereotype that those among us with the least means are of those means because they have made worse choices (e.g. drug use) than the rest of us. Changes to the laws can avoid this constitutional debacle, though, by asking an applicant to indicate whether s/he has a history of drug use and, if s/he checks yes, testing would be constitutional (or has been perceived as such)."

To be completely honest, I wouldn't expect many (if any at all) of the individuals using heroin to have ever stepped into a Planned Parenthood (despite what Pence has claimed in the past).  Please, stop spreading this narrative. It is not true. Pence is an asshole, and Republicans obsession with destroying Planned Parenthood has caused many negative effects.

It sounds logical at face value, but we know that it hasn't had much (if any) impact on the HIV outbreak. PP has struggled to attract needle users for many years and it's been a major priority for them. However, because of how much Republicans hate them, they are very hesitant to market themselves as a resource to needle users and other high-risk individuals. Just think about it, if Planned Parenthood came out and started talking about how they are working to support drug users, it would just give more fuel to Republicans to ban them completely.

From the same source:   The first stage of HIV infection is defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a CD4+ cell count of at least 500 cells per microliter or a percentage of CD4+ cells at least 29% of all lymphocytes. People in this stage don't have any symptoms.   AIDS.gov has some interesting information as well:   Within 2-4 weeks after HIV infection, many, but not all, people develop flu-like symptoms, often described as “the worst flu ever.”   So it doesn't just ""feel like HIV,"" you might just think you have the flu.   After the acute stage of HIV infection, the disease moves into a stage called the “clinical latency” stage. “Latency” means a period where a virus is living or developing in a person without producing symptoms. . .It is important to remember that people in this symptom-free stage are still able to transmit HIV to others.   You cannot blame HIV away by attacking the people who have it and making it out to be a ""choice"" they made. It will still kill them, and they will continue to spread it to other people. We need to approach this problem with real solutions, which means using science, evidence, and medical expertise, and not moralistic political judgement. Mike Pence needs to take his ego and his ideology out of this fight."

It's quite laughable to believe that PP would have prevented this from becoming an epidemic. You seem to have a very distorted view of people who use services provided by PP.  However, you can put a good amount of blame on Republicans for this. The stubbornness over needle-sharing programs, and cutting public funding to hospitals may have helped to contain this. Reports have continued to show that many of those infected with HIV were aware, but continued to share needles. These people are addicts and the threat of AIDS isn't a deterrent for heroin users.   There are plenty of reasons to criticize Pence and Indiana Republicans on this issue. However, bringing up Planned Parenthood is nonsense and it makes you seem like the type of person that only gets their news from ThinkProgress."

You could bring down the number of abortions nationwide by funding PP at a level that allows them to do their jobs, but the anti-choice mother fuckers would rather have the abortions than fund the clinics that could help the women before they get pregnant.   As a side benefit, these same clinics offer testing for HIV that would allow people with the disease to take precautionary measures.   Your claim is bullshit."

Indiana,33cahd,Solkre,-4,Tue Apr 21 11:38:50 2015 UTC,"Republicans have nothing to do with the illegality of funding needle exchanges.    Needles, like pretty much every other device used by trained professionals, are controlled devices and require a prescription to be dispensed.  To get a prescription, you need a medical necessity.  There is no medical necessity here and no physician would risk his or her license to facilitate a drug addict to inject a potent opiate analgesic with a huge risk of death.  These are matters of fact and exist on the federal level, not the state.  Untrained people should not be in possession of medical devices, and especially not for uses like this.  There's a reason that the ER gives you a script for Vicodin and doesn't send you home with a bunch of syringes and vials of morphine after an orthopedic injury."

Indiana,33cahd,pasaroanth,-3,Tue Apr 21 20:26:06 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that it isn't an epidemic and it's a lesser of two evils thing, but it's still the government funding illegal activity.    Their mindset (which isn't all that outlandish) is that ""if we start handing out free needles it's like we're saying it's okay to shoot up illegal drugs"".  Keep this in mind: in 2014 there were nearly 1,000 (999) drug-overdose deaths in Indiana.  In 2012 (the most recent statistic I could find) there were 509 new HIV infections.    I've been in medicine for going on 15 years now, 10 of which were in EMS as a paramedic.  In my coverage area of around 60,000 people, we had an unresponsive/not breathing person as a result of IV drug use once every 36 hours, on average.  Without EMS intervention using Narcan, they would be dead.  Period.    I get that this whole HIV thing is fucked up, but the opiate drug epidemic is also pretty fucked up.  I'm very conflicted on the idea of providing people needles to shoot up drugs that they have NO idea the purity, concentration, reaction, or source of.  Yes, we're helping solve one problem, but we're exacerbating another."
Indiana,33cahd,TeeSeventyTwo,2,Tue Apr 21 16:41:43 2015 UTC,"You can frame it as funding illegal behavior, or you can view it as funding safe behavior. Harm reduction is the most effective way to deal with the public health issue of drug abuse, and refusing to devote resources to protecting drug users does nothing to solve the problem of drug use--rather, it exacerbates it.  What you should be reading from the statistics that you provided is that people are shooting up anyway, they're just doing it with dirty needles. No one sees a syringe and thinks ""oh, I guess I'll get into heroin now."" It goes the other way around: desperate heroin addicts seek out means of continuing their use of the substance, even if those means are extremely risky.  I'm worried that you're a healthcare provider and this is your outlook on the issue; it's extremely outdated and ignorant of the dynamics of drug abuse. You need to cite evidence supporting the claim that free clean needles increase intravenous controlled substance abuse rates significantly if you're going to make a good case for not helping to fight an HIV epidemic.   May I remind you that at the same time needle exchanges were controversial for Reagan, so were pamphlets giving gay men information about protecting themselves from HIV. Reagan didn't want to ""support"" gay sex either, and viewed the issue as identical to that of the needle exchanges. So he refused to use either method to help stop HIV, and as a result the epidemic of the '80s raged under his watch. Margaret Thatcher, on the other hand, allowed at least for needle exchanges, and Britain as a result saw a great reduction in cases compared to the United States. Conservatives have a very poor record when it comes to HIV, and this kind of thinking (of ""condoning"" ""evil"" behavior) needs to put to rest permanently."
Indiana,33cahd,pasaroanth,-2,Tue Apr 21 19:21:26 2015 UTC,"YOU ARE NOT FUNDING SAFE BEHAVIOR  DOING DRUGS IS NOT SAFE BEHAVIOR  THIS SHIT IS NOT DEBATABLE  I'm not fucking daft enough to think that needle exchanges don't have a public health benefit of reducing disease transmission, but giving addicts fresh new needles doesn't just suddenly make shit all sunshine and rainbows after that.  They're still buying shitty drugs made by who the hell knows who in who the hell knows where.    When I administer a med, I take EXTREME caution in keeping a sterile environment (fresh needle, alcohol on the vial cap, alcohol on the IV port, fresh needle after drawing up).  These people are using drugs that were divvied out on a dirty table, weighed on a dirty scale, stored in a ziploc bag made in china, and cooked up on a nasty old spoon that rolled around in the floor of their car.  Then they push the needle through their dirty, bacteria covered skin without any sort of antiseptic use.  You really think that shit is without risk of infection?    Guess what: very nearly as many people die in the US from MRSA ALONE, not including the hundreds, if not thousands of other infections.  And guess what else?  What you shoot up, you skip through the body's amazing defense system and that infection immediately becomes systemic.  That blood goes to every part of your body.    You're cutting out the ""I didn't get an infection from the person who also used this needle"" part, but it is most definitely not devoid of infection risk.    I'm done with this thread.  Everyone's thought processes are based on this convoluted idea that if we give addicts fresh needles then we can just sweep that whole problem under the rug because it's all going to be okay since their HIV risk will become diminished."
Indiana,33cahd,TeeSeventyTwo,4,Tue Apr 21 19:34:58 2015 UTC,"You have a very narrow understanding of this issue, and are refusing to view drugs as a complicated public health problem. Like the police, you want to see it as a one-dimensional problem that can be solved with a little more lecturing, or a few more arrests, etc. You're not the first person to wish that opiates would just go away, but they have a history of evading prohibition that stretches back to before this country was even conceived of.  No one here thinks that needle exchanges are going to erase the problem of HIV utterly, or stop heroin use. What people are saying is that blocking needle exchanges is refusing to help address a problem for no reason other than an ideology obsessed with rigid morals and punishment. All evidence is against you. You are becoming furious at people for proposing solutions that you don't like, but offering nothing whatsoever to help otherwise. You've been dealing with this problem for a long time by your own admission, and yet it's still a problem, so maybe your guidance isn't all we need.  You can be ""done with this thread,"" but unfortunately the consensuses of science, medicine, and public health are turning against your way of thought as well, and so there may come a day when you will either have to open your mind to new evidence-based solutions, or be ""done"" with medicine."

Cigarette harm reduction is taking it from a 5 to a 3 on the potentially immediately out of 10 harmful scale.  Giving them fresh needles to avoid getting HIV is taking it from a 10 to a 9.8.    Come back and talk to me after you've been the one to let a family know that their son is dead because he shot up some ""heroin"" that was laced with fentanyl and injected entirely too much.    Controversial or not, the government paying for and supplying needles for people to use ABSURDLY dangerous drugs is ridiculous.  Maybe spend the money resources on addiction counseling and letting them know that sharing needles is a high risk of HIV?  That's working towards solving the core problem, not putting a really shitty dollar store band-aid on it to try to fix one of the (in all reality) less harmful side effects.    I'm not hip on getting fucking HIV, but leaving behind my family sounds a lot worse than that."
Indiana,33cahd,C-64c,3,Tue Apr 21 18:24:50 2015 UTC,Needle exchanges in most parts of the US offer many resources beyond just clean syringes. Education and directing clients to resources they may not be aware of is a big part of what they provide. Many offer Narcan (and administration training) as well.

I'm not on a judgmental pedestal here.    My point is that this is not a permanent fix.  It's a temporary solution to what is really a very, very small part of that drug abuse epidemic.  This is the same as getting a can of spray paint to cover up a big rusty spot on the frame of your car before you sell it so the buyer doesn't see it.  Yeah, the rust is unsightly, but your real problem isn't the looks, it's the lack of frame integrity.    We need to work on solving this problem.  I've seen entirely too many kids die from this shit.  Hell, one of my first calls as a paramedic was for four 18 year old kids who decided that it'd be cool to score some heroin for their sleepover graduation celebration.    Two died, one has permanent brain damage from hypoxia, and the other is mentally fucked for life.  My biggest fear, as I've said before, is that this will infer that this is an OK thing to do.  You and I may see this is harm reduction, but an addicts mind sees this differently.  They may interpret it as ""well if the government is cool with buying me needles, they think it's okay right?"" or ""the biggest thing I was worried about was using dirty needles, now that that risk is gone I'm golden!""  Anyway, I have a ton of reading to do.  Sorry about your loss, trust me when I say I've seen the pain that this shit has caused.

Indiana,334bvi,MentalAsFog,0,Mon Apr 20 11:00:54 2015 UTC,"From the article:   Money could also be an issue as lawmakers weigh their options. Since 1989, the federal government has banned public financing of needle exchange programs.    From whitehouse.gov:   On December 16, 2009, President Obama signed into law an end to the longstanding ban on most Federal funding for needle exchange programs, giving us more opportunities to stop the spread of HIV and other infections among injecting drug users (IDUs). The Administration continues to support a consistent policy that would allow Federal funds to be used in locations where local authorities deem needle exchange programs to be effective and appropriate. Unfortunately, Congress has reinstated the ban.   But, to clarify (from rhrealitycheck.org):   Harm reduction as an approach is controversial because many legislators and members of the public make the knee-jerk assumption that it signifies approval of drug use. But it’s worth stating clearly that syringe exchange programs are not federally illegal; they just can’t be paid for by federal dollars. Aside from keeping programs from using money they’re already receiving (for HIV testing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for instance) that limitation also bottlenecks funds that could be coming from state and local sources.  “States are not undertaking syringe programs because they see the federal ban as sort of a scarlet letter,” Michael Collins, policy manager at the Drug Policy Alliance, told RH Reality Check. “When the ban was lifted during the Obama administration’s first two years, we did see an uptick in states’ interest and funding. When we have the ban in place, it’s incredibly counterproductive for states having syringe programs.”   So, Indiana could have the program, we just can't pay for it with Federal funds."

It's my opinion that he will transition the issuance of marriage licenses to a ""private moral authority"".  This will allow the private marriage license holder to pick and choose who can get married, leaving the state out of it and protecting all from lawsuit.    I believe that this will be harder since he had to revise it to include anti-sex discrimination but it will only take time until a smart lawyer can word it just right."
Indiana,32wz74,87westy,2,Fri Apr 17 16:25:24 2015 UTC,It's my opinion that it would be political suicide for him to do so at this point.
Indiana,32wz74,emmOne,2,Sat Apr 18 12:14:34 2015 UTC,Anything he does now is just to further his cronies.  There is a low probability he will be elected to a second term.

Indiana,32wz74,MisterSanitation,3,Fri Apr 17 19:28:05 2015 UTC,"Amen to this. If you have REAL religious reasons to do something, why should anything stop you?  It's depressing that the whole conversation, conservative and liberal, was always about business. ""Businesses should be able to refuse to be part of ceremonies they can't consciously participate in."" ""We should hit Indiana in the wallet to change their tune.""  If it has anything to do with God or human rights, then it should never be about money."
Indiana,32wz74,samrequireham,-9,Sat Apr 18 00:13:27 2015 UTC,"He's right that Pence shouldn't have caved to economic pressure.  Otherwise he was just another ignorant piece of shit forcing his beliefs on others through the form of madness where equality trumps justice.  His fame didn't come from understanding law, God, morality, or anything in between, but he's acting like it was.  Fanning the flames of trumped up moral outrage against good people.  This guy should stick to music and quit being a dick."

I subscribe to Abdul's Cheat Sheet (seriously a great $25 if you're trying to stay up to date on the in-state political gossip) and there's been a lot of chatter in there that he's kinda been abandoned by the establishment right. You don't need the establishment to necessarily win primaries, but if you don't have the support of the establishment ""Indianapolis Republicans"" you will not win an statewide general."

That was well before RFRA, so I can imagine his numbers never really got too high to start with."

Indiana,32wz2l,GregOfAllTrades,5,Fri Apr 17 16:41:09 2015 UTC,"The law probably didn't legally do what everyone was saying. The fact that there is enough uncertainty that I had to say probably, means that the clarification at least was necessary. The uncertainty being that you had to trust the courts to make the right decision when it was inevitably tested. Over 22 years of RFRA the judges have made the right call on those cases. But you know, you never can be certain."

Though I never used that statement, because come on, no layman is going to read a bunch of legal speak and be able to settle on what it means. I was convinced and still remain convinced that it was ultimately a bill that did nothing (we already had court precedent supporting what the language of the bill stated). Of course, I'm also well aware that in politics, perception means more than reality a lot of times."

He passed a law that would protect small businesses, anger people who wouldn't vote for him, and please people who do.  It was a good move.  However, adding the clarification that will likely be used in courts to nullify those protections make him look weak-willed and compromised.  Matters of right and wrong like this can't be compromised for money or state publicity.    Let them keep their money, let them hate us.  Those are petty trifles compared to justice.  The acceptance of contraceptives, divorce, homosexual acts, and now recognizing same-sex pairs like marriage has put the West into a nosedive, so the way forward is the opposite of where they are going.

Still doesn't change the fact that he is a moderate Republican   Congrats, you found a single year where he sided with Republicans higher than normal, yet still less than half of the time.

Given that modern progressives (not the ""ban all social ills"" folk) tend to support anti-prohibition, it seems to me that the most likely core of the anti-legalization movement is going to be social conservatives, law enforcement unions, and any of those organizations which make money from arrest and penalizing those who partake.  This would mean, however, that the anti-prohibition team really is the strange bedfellow combination of Democrats and economic Republicans.

Let's be honest, what you really don't like is more people working together having more power than you do alone, and that's why people band together in the first place.

Indiana,32psq6,intravenus_de_milo,2,Thu Apr 16 15:30:54 2015 UTC,"What does that even mean? Really?    It means that the ideas of parties are sorta ridiculous. Labels, across most aspects in life, in general are ridiculous. I have had this debate many times with people. The people that are happy with the system of course don't see the problem, they are part of the problem, they just don't know it.   And why?   There are many reasons, if you're serious about having a discussion I'd be happy to converse about it. However, I don't feel like pouring my ideas out to people on reddit who just want to knock others down though, which based on your next statement, seems like that's pretty much what you want to do.   Let's be honest, what you really don't like is more people working together having more power than you do alone   Let's really be honest and say you have no right to make that assumption, and to say it with such authority.   If you want to get elected you need people to knock on doors, make phone calls, stuff envelopes, set up office, and otherwise do all the boring work of campaigning.   I know how elections work, I've participated in many aspects of the current political system through much of my adult life (everything from campaign volunteering, to social activism like organized protests).

That's ~27k, if we assume all 2014 votes in fact cast a vote for sec state.  For local office, that's only about 500 signatures (Vigo County), but I'm not going to foment change as the township trustee...  (Actually, that wouldn't be a bad position to effect some change, because the way they handle allowing people to use the local free clinic is abominable, but that's neither here nor there.)

Indiana,32psq6,whatisupdoge,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:03:36 2015 UTC,We already have a very very weak executive. And the legislature in this same bill stripped governor powers as well by making some board members legislative branch appointments.
Indiana,32psq6,hoosierstateofmind,0,Thu Apr 16 15:46:47 2015 UTC,3 Board members are legislative branch appointments. 10 are appointed by the governor. The governor was basically given the ability to control who becomes the board chair.
Indiana,32psq6,whatisupdoge,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:55:51 2015 UTC,Right. I'm just saying the legislature has diluted the governor's power here as well. What if Jon Gregg is governor in two years? He's now lost some ability to control the process as well
Indiana,32psq6,hoosierstateofmind,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:00:40 2015 UTC,The governor didn't lose anything. He gets to appoint 10 of the 13 board members. Before the bill he was able to appoint 10 of 12 board members. One vote isn't changing his grip on what the board does.
Indiana,32psq6,whatisupdoge,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:03:44 2015 UTC,"It's not over yet, but he now gets 10 of 13 votes instead of 10 of 11.

Dilution of power on the board is not a good thing for the governor even if he still controls the majority because of the quotas."

Indiana,32psq6,mhoner,6,Thu Apr 16 11:13:40 2015 UTC,They're not removing her from office. They're making the State Board of Education chairmanship elected from board members instead of automatically having it go to the superintendent.

Indiana,32psq6,whatisupdoge,2,Thu Apr 16 15:05:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think they should be elected. Governor and Legislature are the offices constitutionally charged with education, they should have the greatest say. I felt that way when it was Evan Bayh and Sue Ellen Reed and I'll feel that way in the future. State Superintendent is an administrator, not a policy creator."
Indiana,32psq6,hoosierstateofmind,5,Thu Apr 16 16:28:09 2015 UTC,Her elected office is Superintendent of Schools. The state board of education is an entirely different entity but answers to the superintendent. She still holds 100% of the power granted to her elected office. Historically the sperintendent became the chairman of the BOE by default. This is what they are attempting to change.

Indiana,32q2j6,cbacca,3,Wed Apr 15 20:16:52 2015 UTC,"I'd pump the breaks on the histrionics over CCW. In the end, we're talking about probably 4% change in pricing for local governments. You can keep wages right where they are and make up 4% on the back end in efficiency or material costs. If we were talking 10-20% like the non-union folks would want you to believe then maybe freak out. If we're talking reality it probably is not that high or as disastrous as the union folks make out.   This is essentially a rehash of Senator Michael Young's floor speech as I was watching yesterday. Of everyone that spoke, he seemed to be the guy that wasn't just throwing talking points at a wall to see what sticks."
Indiana,32q2j6,hoosierstateofmind,2,Thu Apr 16 12:37:17 2015 UTC,I honestly hope you are right.
Indiana,32q2j6,Girl_Named_Sandoz,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:24:16 2015 UTC,"Me too, but I guess I don't understand how if they don't HAVE to pay a certain wage, why they WOULD keep wages the same. Why not just bid the job for about the same price as usual and then pay the workers less as long as it doesn't go so low you can't hire anybody? Not that I agree with it, but I don't see why this wouldn't be a common sense business decision."
Indiana,32q2j6,thyming,2,Thu Apr 16 15:02:08 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I am afraid of happening. Out of state companies could come in and bid the jobs for slightly less to get the job and pay workers significantly less. Well see how it all plays out.
Indiana,32q2j6,hoosierstateofmind,4,Thu Apr 16 16:11:14 2015 UTC,"You're going to be replaced by a Texas contractor who employs undocumented workers.  Things could turn around in 2017 after the elections, but that's a long time to wait."
Indiana,32q2j6,Girl_Named_Sandoz,-2,Thu Apr 16 16:45:17 2015 UTC,"Because a certain wage usually guarantees a certain level of ability. For example, someone with a Masters is not going to work for minimum wage at McDonald's. They're overqualified. You're going to get what you pay for in that minimum wage position. That's also likely what you're going to get with low wage laborers. These guys aren't going to just start making $10 an hour. The example the Senate kept using yesterday was Allen County/Fort Wayne projects. Allen County used the lower wage of $28 an hour. Fort Wayne School Corp used the higher $40 an hour. So even the basement ""bidding"" of the CCW was still a very good wage. And of course that $28/hour is likely to go up the more skilled you are. That's how literally every other job works."
Indiana,32q2j6,hoosierstateofmind,3,Thu Apr 16 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"No, they aren't going to make $10 an hour, because that's too low to be able to hire someone as skilled as you need for the job such as an electrician. How about $25 an hour vs. $28 an hour though? That sort of thing is what I'm thinking is much more likely, and it does affect people."
Indiana,32q2j6,bt112506,-2,Thu Apr 16 17:46:21 2015 UTC,That's firmly middle class money.
Indiana,32q2j6,bt112506,2,Thu Apr 16 18:47:18 2015 UTC,Skill is a lot in construction but it is not everything. Will the out of state laborer work overtime and not report it? Because employers still ask for that. Will safety be a top concern? We have safety meetings every week and or every day depending on the job. Will the job be done right? A lot of universities and state jobs have been cutting back on inspectors lately. Lots of really shady stuff happening around this. Just based on the fact it was introduced by a Koch pac makes me squeamish.
Indiana,32q2j6,bt112506,2,Thu Apr 16 17:19:01 2015 UTC,Just curious was you Union or nonunion?
Indiana,32q2j6,PlasmaBurnz,4,Thu Apr 16 00:07:33 2015 UTC,I've worked non union and union. Am currently union. Would love to have stayed that way. Considering that the lowest bid is going to get the job it's not going to matter. The companies that were non union will have to bid jobs so low I won't accept the wage. I've got my associates degree and 5 years of apprenticeship  and countless upgrade classes. I fully believe my time is worth 25-35 hr and I have the skills to back it up.
Indiana,32q2j6,CrackerJoe,3,Thu Apr 16 01:04:20 2015 UTC,Yea I agree. I'm also union.

Indiana,32kxjk,hoosierstateofmind,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:53:04 2015 UTC,"Frank Marshall calls himself a lifelong Republican, but on Monday he stood on the steps of the Statehouse and denounced GOP leaders for their efforts to kill Indiana’s 80-year-old common construction wage.  Marshall, a second-generation contractor from Valparaiso, told about 8,000 protesters that he regretted donations to Republicans who want end the system that sets wages for workers on public projects.  “I’m going to tell you, I’m sorry I did that,” said Marshall, setting off a roar of approval from construction workers who traveled from all over the state to protest the proposal that has strong backing of Gov. Mike Pence.  “I feel a strong of sense of betrayal,” Marshall said after leaving the podium to make way for a long line of speakers. “I just don’t think there is anything wrong with a man or woman earning a fair wage.” It was a theme repeated throughout the two-hour rally, which was organized by the Indiana Building Contractors Alliance.  Repeal supporters claim that ending the law, which sets union-level wages on public construction projects such as schools, saves taxpayers money by permitting the free market to determine worker pay.  The Building Contractors Alliance, made up of 4,000 contractors, cites the prevailing wage’s origins as a 1930s-era protective measure to keep out-of-state contractors with unskilled workers from undercutting local companies on government jobs. The wage covers more than $1.5 billion in public construction projects a year and 75,000 workers.  Strong opposition has also come from the state’s building trade unions, which have partnered with contractors to create apprenticeship training programs that lead to high-skilled, good-paying jobs. The legislation to repeal the wage law sprung forth unexpectedly earlier in the session, coming on the heels a court decision upholding the state’s contentious right-to-work law, which has weakened labor union membership.  In late March, the Republican Pence’s campaign bought $250,000 worth of ads supporting the repeal of common construction wage, with the governor saying the law “is outdated and costs Hoosier taxpayers millions in additional building costs.”  The Republican-controlled House passed the legislation before it was taken up by Pence allies in the Senate, which is expected to debate the measure Tuesday and take a final vote on it later in the week. Democratic leaders at the rally condemned the proposal as a Republican attempt to gut middle-class wages.  “We will not have working men and women of this state nailed to the cross of low wages,” said House Minority Leader Scott Pelath of Michigan City.  He and other Democrats said Republican leaders who underestimated the fallout from the divisive Religious Freedom Restoration Act — which had to be amended to quell a storm of national criticism — also underestimate the fallout from what Democrats say is an attack on working families. But some of the strongest criticism of the repeal effort came from Republican legislators who voted against it and from contractors who said their longtime support of GOP leaders has earned them little in return.  Sen. Ed Soliday, R-Valpraiso, criticized leaders of his party who’ve claimed repealing the wage could reduce the costs of public construction up to 20 percent.  “That a myth,” said Soliday, to a cheering crowd. He urged protesters not to make the legislation into a partisan issue or one that pits business against labor.  “If we make this political ... Republican versus Democrat, business versus labor, we’re going to lose,” he said.  Mike Menke, head of the Indiana State Pipe Trades, said Republicans have increasingly found support among union workers who hold conservative views on many issues.  “Most of the people in this crowd have been ardent supporters of the Republican Party,” Menke said. “This is the God, guns, and babies crowd right here.”  Portage Mayor James Snyder, a Republican who opposes the wage repeal, got a rousing cheer when he quoted President Ronald Reagan and said Republican leaders forget “that the sweat of a man’s brow is the fuel of this nation’s economy.”  His words resonated with a group of union electricians from Kokomo. “I think everybody should be concerned about this, whether they’re Democrats or Republicans,” said George Gardineer. “If they repeal this and start sending money out of state, it’s not going to do us any good here.”  Also in the crowd was Rep. Mike Karickhoff, of Kokomo. He was one of 13 out of 70 House Republicans who opposed the wage repeal.  Karickhoff said he hopes his Republican colleagues will pay attention to the voices at the rally. “In my district, trade unions are high-profile,” he said. “They do a great job and even the private sector understand their value. So it’ll be interesting to see what the Senate does as this bill continues to advance.”"

I am pretty sure most Hoosiers really do support treating me like a real human being, despite what you obviously wish.  It's a pity that me being myself offends you.  But your opinion is NOT that of the majority of people, and especially my fellow Hoosiers.  This was me a couple of weeks ago, during the Trans Day of Awareness, and the period coincidentally right after the RFRA was passed and caused such a shitstorm.  During those weeks, I have walked around here in Southern IN, Sellersburg no less, and was welcomed enthusiastically by all of my usual haunts.  They went OUT OF THEIR WAY to be nice to me, making sure I knew I was welcome in their establishment.  Y'all really are living in a bubble if you think you can transmit your ignorant, bigoted hate to the rest of Indiana based on its rural nature.  They are still decent people, and increasingly I believe they live in a horribly corrupt state, politically, which is the ONLY reason the RFRA passed.  It certainly was not the main agenda of the people who run my corner Circle K, or the Meijer down the road, or the two Tumbleweed restaurants I frequent, nor the Kobe steakhouse on the river, nor Rocky's just a block away, nor the Waffle House two blocks away.  NONE of those folks had a burning need to eject me, humiliated, from their store as they hurled 'tranny' and 'faggot' at me.  In fact, there has been exactly ONE restaurant host who has mistreated me in my 9 months of transition, here in Southern Indiana.  I saw in his Yelp reviews he's not doing too well with other people either.    It's a shame you are clinging so tightly to this hateful idea like it's your shining golden nugget of moral perfectitude.

Indiana,32ijm5,dv1155,5,Tue Apr 14 19:04:52 2015 UTC,"What's cruel is the left's abuse and exploitation of mentally ill people to use as a political talking point instead of encouraging them to seek help.   And what kind of help would you have a transgender person seek?  For context, though it is included in the DSM V for Mental Disorders, the current label is Gender Dysphoria and not Gender Disorder. This recognizes the fact that transgender people suffer from a type of neuro-somatic parallax that is most likely congenital in nature and highly treatable through hormone therapy and possibly surgery. The need for the latter only arises if the individual has passed puberty and typically, the farther past puberty the more likely surgery would be needed to correct body dysmorphia. But, there are all types of variance in this.  People who could be described as ""haters"" (I'm looking at you /u/dv1155) typically only qualify older male-to-female transgender individuals in their bias as that group probably has the most difficult time with transition and blending in with their gender. However, ""haters"" often dismiss the fact that female-to-male transgender people exist, and possibly at similar ratios within society."

Indiana,32ijm5,imnotboo,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:48:33 2015 UTC,"I'm your huckleberry.  Psychotherapy for transgender individuals is necessary to determine if there are any underlying factors causing someone to self-identify or report a gender dysphoria such as alcoholism, physical/mental abuse, etc. Those are things that can be treated separately and may help resolve a perceived gender dysphoria. This is the way that axis of diagnosis works.  Part of the reason that trans people seek psychotherapy (a big part) is because of society's negative treatment of them, aka YOU. If you're wondering how or why Indiana's original RFRA was discriminatory, you are part of the problem."
Indiana,32ijm5,daphnephoria,-9,Tue Apr 14 14:40:25 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason that trans people seek psychotherapy (a big part) is because of society's negative treatment of them   Wrong, it's because they have a mental disorder. There is no evolutionary benefit to humans changing their gender and becoming non-reproducing. There is not a single scientific argument you can present for transgenderism being normal, only political. It's part of the liberal war on science."
Indiana,32ijm5,dv1155,6,Tue Apr 14 16:24:49 2015 UTC,"LOL! Go to school. It will help to remove your head from your ass and is better for your posture.  People often use the term ""mental disorder"" as a write-off category, like labeling someone ""crazy"". Gender dysphoria is a little different than any other qualified mental disorder and is treatable, much like depression. The definition of gender dysphoria (as we call it today) is evolving as we learn more about it. When you say, ""There is not a single scientific argument you can present for transgenderism being normal, only political,"" you clearly have no understanding (nor do you want to have) of transgender issues. Much to your own detriment. Understanding the issue will not only help with empathy, but also will lead to constructive solutions. Being a bigoted Hoosier only leads to the detriment of your state, currently being recognized around the nation as a ""hate state"".

Indiana,32ijm5,PlasmaBurnz,5,Tue Apr 14 13:21:03 2015 UTC,"You can try to reword it all you want but it comes down they to deny a service that would be offered to someone else no problem.  That is discrimination.  You are trying to justify it by separating the two.  It's not same-sex marriage, it's just marriage.  You can try to redefine it all you would like, they are the same thing.  You can yell and scream until you're blue in the face, but in the end it's all the same the same thing. Two folks getting hitched.    And why are you trying to make your point sound more educated by attacking me personally and trying to incorporate a Chinese dictator.  If you honestly think your point is valid, let it stand on its own merits.  This isn't a left vs right issue. It's not liberal vs conservative.  It's a human rights issue.  Hence the reason why most people in general think this is nonsense."
Indiana,32ijm5,mhoner,9,Tue Apr 14 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"That isn't refusing to serve people based on their sexual orientation, but what they want to do.   Isn't the reason they want to have a gay marriage just a bit (maybe like 100%) related to them being gay?   They wouldn't serve a wedding between two straight women either.   And this has happened when?   It's not based on their inherent characteristics(like racism), not even beliefs(like religious discrimination)   If you think that people are born gay, then it would be an inherent characteristic.  If you think that people choose or just merely believe they are gay, then it wold be a belief.  So I guess no matter what you think, it's discrimination.   Those are the facts   K."
Indiana,32ijm5,stickyrickysanty,-5,Tue Apr 14 17:42:55 2015 UTC,"Isn't the reason they want to have a gay marriage just a bit (maybe like 100%) related to them being gay?     No.  If it were, they wouldn't serve gay people on any and every other occasion.     And this has happened when?     Why wouldn't it?  Stuff like this is to be expected.  To think same sex marriage is possible requires such a breakdown in reasoning that it makes marriage arbitrary.  Thus anyone can get 'married' for any reason.  Though it's mystery why such an amorphous blob would continue to justify government regulation.  Until the government gives up on marriage due to its acquired incompetence we will just have to put up with absurdity.     If you think that people are born gay, then it would be an inherent characteristic. If you think that people choose or just merely believe they are gay, then it wold be a belief. So I guess no matter what you think, it's discrimination.     I guess you misread me.  It doesn't matter if its a belief or a genetic/developmental characteristic.  It has nothing to do with who the person is, but what they are trying to do(same sex wedding).  Weddings are celebrations of the complete union between the bride and the groom.  Replacing the bride with another groom transforms it from a union into a mockery of humanity and a celebration of sexual abomination."
Indiana,32ijm5,PlasmaBurnz,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:24:43 2015 UTC,"But in Indiana it is perfectly legal to discriminate against gays for any reason.

This often makes people think they've found some unusual snake.   FYI for people: Poisonous snakes in Indiana are exceedingly rare. There are a few species of rattlesnakes, which are unmistakable, in very confined geographic areas in Southern Indiana. Then there are the Cottonmouths (aka Water Moccasin) and the Copperheads. In my experience everyone in the state swears they had a Cottonmouth or Copperhead in their yard.   ALL poisonous snakes in Indiana are pit vipers. Without exception. Look for the telltale pit in front of the eyes and the elliptical pupils. If it has those two features then stay away. If it doesnt have those features your likely looking at a garter snake."

In fact if you live north of I-70 and saw one you were almost assuredly at a zoo. If your in the Hoosier national forest or another state forest down south you MIGHT have seen one.
Indiana,329xxh,imnotacrazyperson,1 point,Sun Apr 12 20:49:42 2015 UTC,"I live in a fairly rural area with creeks and lots of thick wooded areas.  We get copperheads here, but never in the yard.   They are pretty thick in the state park nearby. I've seen a couple of them there, and that is somebody who knows where to look and is actively looking for them.   I'm not saying a copperhead encounter in the state is not going to happen because we do have them, however I think most people are confused about the snakes that they see in their yard every year.  Fox snake can look like a copperhead from a distance I guess if you don't get a good look at it.  I think some cottonmouth yard sightings might actually just be black rat snakes.  Those are abundant.  Either way, I wish people would just leave them alone. I'm always hearing somebody talk about how they had to kill the snake in their yard or they want to know how to kill snakes that get in their yard.  If you leave it alone, it will move on when it no longer has a food source.  No need to kill anything."

If that were the case they'd be opposed to capitalism, since capitalism--and especially laissez-faire capitalism--is a fundamentally authoritarian mode of socioeconomic organization.  Capitalism rests on the institution of private property, which literally cannot exist without systemic violence.  If you advocate capitalism, you advocate slavery.  The ""laissez-faire"" part simply means a ""laissez-faire approach to people who would oppress and enslave others,"" which has nothing at all to do with real freedom.  If you believe in private property, you don't believe in ""free and open borders"" in any meaningful (that is, not purely formalistic) sense.  You believe in slavery, coercion, aggression, and tyranny.  Real libertarians are and always have been anti-capitalist anarchist communists for that very reason.  Individual liberty simply cannot exist without collective ownership of the means of production and equal distribution of social wealth.  Why do you hate freedom so much?"
Indiana,320rw1,GregOfAllTrades,0,Thu Apr 9 22:06:29 2015 UTC,"capitalism--and especially laissez-faire capitalism--is a fundamentally authoritarian mode of socioeconomic organization.   Capitalism: property rights and voluntary exchange of goods.  How is this a ""fundamentally authoritarian mode of socioeconomic organization""?   Capitalism rests on the institution of private property, which literally cannot exist without systemic violence.   Incorrect. If I lock the door to my house then I am initiating violence on no one. Btw when you make this argument you are TRYING to show that our ideology is inconsistent within itself. I am sure you know that a state LITERALLY IS systemic violence. so if you are not opposed to systemic violence, then by your own logic you should favor libertarianism.   If you advocate capitalism, you advocate slavery.   How so? If everything in capitalism is voluntary and slavery being not voluntary, then it would seem that this statement is logically invalid.  And btw I know you have no problem with slavery if you advocate for a state, so you should actually favor libertarianism by your own logic.   If you believe in private property... You believe in slavery, coercion, aggression, and tyranny.   No. Property RIGHTS is the idea that you own yourself and things you create/physically change or things you voluntary exchanged for.   Real libertarians are and always have been anti-capitalist anarchist communists for that very reason.   REAL libertarians are anyone that advocates for property rights (there are some disputes about what constitutes property) and the non initiation of force.   Individual liberty simply cannot exist without collective ownership of the means of production and equal distribution of social wealth.   No because these systems require a state, and the state is a monopoly of force on a geographical area.  Now, to wrap it all up, why do libertarians advocate to limit or remove the power of government? Because psychopaths will use it for their own self interest, or to achieve power for its own sake. In a capitalist society psychopaths work for you, in a state you are enslaved to the psychopath."
Indiana,320rw1,TheYetiCaptain1993,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:51:27 2015 UTC,"Capitalism: property rights and voluntary exchange of goods.   Private property, yes, which can only exist on a foundation of aggressive violence.  As for voluntary exchange...well, under capitalism there's nothing voluntary about it.   Property RIGHTS is the idea that you own yourself   See, that's just it.  You don't own yourself.  To own yourself requires a distinction between you and yourself, which is the root of slavery.  Those of us who value freedom and individual liberty reject the authoritarian dictum of self-ownership, and instead embrace the idea that far from owning ourselves, we are ourselves and are entitled to dignity and autonomy due to that very fact.   No because these systems require a state   Please stop making shit up.  The state is an instrument of class domination, which does not exist in a free--that is to say, a communist--society."
Indiana,320rw1,TheYetiCaptain1993,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:18:34 2015 UTC,"Free and open borders improve capitalism.    You like the concept of borders, just as long as the state is not the one enforcing them.  You are fine with me crossing between the US-Mexico border without hassle (I am too, don't get me wrong), but I would imagine you are also the type of person who is not fine with people crossing into your private property without your permission.  /u/Gregofalltrades point is that capitalists must be pro borders (private borders at least) and and restricted access to territory, because that is the whole point of private property.  So saying Libertarians believe in free and open borders is not entirely true; they believe in free and open state borders.      Capitalism is not slavery. Slavery is slavery.    It is not chattel slavery, no.  Coercion and exploitation are inherit in the system though.  The capitalist, who controls the capital and the productive forces, has the upper hand in all bargaining and negotiating positions.  It has not been, nor will it ever be, an equal or fair relationship between employee and employer.  The capitalist can pay significantly less than what a laborer is worth because the laborer has no choice but to accept the wage, lest he/she or their family starve.  This is not a voluntary relationship, and this type of worker-employer relationship is used both here and abroad, because it is fundamental to capitalism.  No, it is not nearly as bad here as it is in other countries, but it exists and it is still bad.  And large amounts of our daily life are being subsidized by exploitative labor conditions.  The western middle class way of life would not be able to survive without it.     Fencing people in by invisible borders is violence.    I agree.  Though, I'm not sure to what extent you actually agree either.     It is comical you say ""I hate freedom"" while advocating against freedom and insisting people have possessions or ownership stripped by them, even through violence, to reach what you view as social equality.    You actually love freedom.  You love freedom for those that have the financial capacity to be a member of the ownership class of society, which is almost no one.  When it comes to the rest of society, you are OK with people people dying of preventable diseases, starving when we produce more than enough food, and going homeless when there is more than enough space and shelter for them, as long as ""your"" (in the very unlikely event that you are a member of the ownership class) property rights are not ""infringed"" upon."
Indiana,320rw1,GregOfAllTrades,1 point,Tue Apr 14 04:53:02 2015 UTC,"Depends. If the private property is, say, a crop and you are driving a truck through it and destroying it I would probably say I would have a problem with that.    That is one thing, and that would be your right to do so under out current set of property rights, I won't argue otherwise.  My point was that the principle of exclusion is still there and still important   A border to a private property can only limit access of entry. It does not have the capability to limit you leaving it like a state border does.    Yes, it cannot limit ability to leave, but it still does limit access to entry.  There is a right of exclusion here, as I said before, and functionally that is nearly the same as a state border.  Now, you will get no argument from me that a state not allowing people to leave it is bad, my argument is that zones of exclusion created by property rights and states are bad as well.  In particular I am against absentee ownership, if that helps you understand my positions more as I will explain in more detail    Which is good. The hierarchical relationship pushes employee to desire to be employer. This gives people a goal to succeed and the largest catalyst of new business (which creates more jobs). This is why capitalism works so well.    We disagree here.  I don't think hierarchical relationships push most people to desire to become an employer because I do not believe that most people wish to control other people.  People work hard enough already, I think most people just want a say in the decision making process about what to do with the products of their hard work.  And even if this did push people to want to become employers, should that necessarily be encouraged? Should people be encouraged to escape exploitation by exploiting other people? Not everyone can be an employer, and in the end the problems of worker alienation and unequal power relationships goes unsolved    I've worked in numerous places in Indiana and abroad. I pick where I work. I do not accept jobs that do not pay what I believe as fair. Only the worst of the worst unskilled labor would fit your fantasy. Addressing their deficiency is a better solution than rewarding failure and punishing success (aka the socialist way).    The ""worst of the worst"" labor still has to get done.  And most people around the globe are doing this type of labor.  I'm sure you are a smart and hardworking person, and I am not even being condescending, I am actually sure that you are.  The problem is the example of one person cannot be applied throughout the entirety of society, and your situation cannot be replicated for the earths 7 billion inhabitants.  Someone has to do the hard, unskilled labor, and they shouldn't be punished for contingencies largely out of their control.  The vast majority of people, both here and abroad, do not have the luxury of being able to pick and choose employers and negotiating fair wages.  And the system is not capable of providing that opportunity to the vast majority of people.       You really want to argue that almost no one owns anything?    That is not my argument, though I was not as clear as I should have been.  I am sure you have a smartphone, a car, a house, a laptop, clothes, etc etc.  These are possessions.  You use them, and because you use them you have the right to exclude others from using them.  They are yours.  Private Property in the sense I was using, when reduced to its simplest form, is absentee ownership.  It is owning something that others use.  That is something that almost no one has the resources to do.  I said almost no one is in the ownership class because almost no one absentee owns things except for the extremely wealthy.  I take it you don't own a factory, or a large industrial farming operation, or a mine, or a software company with dozens of employees.     AIDS is preventable but people still die from it. Saying I am ""OK"" with the reality that diseases kill people doesn't say much. Why do you hate those people so much to let them die?     Are you OK with large multinational corporations attempting to prevent the sale of cheaper generic forms of drugs, and selling drugs to cure illnesses in places where the people generally can't afford them? In essence, should someone go without care because they cannot afford it or cannot access it, and the people capable of opening up that access choose not to?    The real problem is getting the food to the people that need it. That is far more complicated than it sounds.    Oh I agree, I know how complicated distribution can be, and how much waste exists, not out of malice or incompetency, but because it is really hard to do much better.  But there are still ways of improving the situation and getting food to those who need at, and lack of material resources is still preventing people from eating.     Unlike you I've worked with the homeless. You are not addressing their real problems by merely giving them shelter.    No, you are not addressing all of their problems by giving them shelter.  The system requires a disposable underclass, some have called it an ""industrial reserve army"".  Capitalism will not end homelessness, and no solution within a capitalist framework will solve the problem.  It's part of the reason why I look to alternatives to capitalism."

Indiana,31ugtn,sirmaxwell,4,Wed Apr 8 06:20:30 2015 UTC,"So from what I've read, it seems like repealing the Common Construction Wage would allow for out-of-state workers to swarm in and take over large construction projects in Indiana for less wages than local workers...  No wonder Pence supports repeal."
Indiana,31ugtn,hansorg,2,Wed Apr 8 17:09:35 2015 UTC,There are valid points on both sides of the debate. But the reality is the Common Construction Wage is intended to prevent out of state companies from undercutting local companies.   You either support giving local businesses an edge and keeping money in the region along with semi-decently paid workers or you support giving less money to the lowest bidder (and lowest bidder quality) and that money potentially/likely leaving the state.
Indiana,31ugtn,internetpolice2143,0,Mon Apr 13 04:23:49 2015 UTC,"I'm lost as to the economic logic that would bring this particular outcome to realization.    For every union contractor in Indiana that pays union scale, there are also non-union contractors that pay merit scale.    For electrical, you have Ermco on the union side, Gaylor on the non-union side.  For mechanical you have Leach & Russell on the union side, and DEEM on the non-union side.  I'm not as familiar with GC and the other trades, but I'm assuming it is similar.  So why wouldn't this work go to Gaylor, DEEM, etc?  You know, the non-union contractors that are already here in state?  How is some contractor from Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, or Kentucky going to compete with them?  They would have to pay hotel costs, transportation expenses, per diem meal costs, etc.  Gaylor and DEEM just have to cover the hourly wage.  The money would still go to in-state contractors."
Indiana,31ugtn,labuzan,9,Wed Apr 8 17:17:34 2015 UTC,Southern contractors pay absolute shit wages compared to Indiana (not that ours are that high).  They can pay low enough wages for their out of state labor and still under bid local contractors.  What makes you think they'll pay per diem and lodging?
Indiana,31ugtn,saintsagan,2,Wed Apr 8 20:09:20 2015 UTC,"They don't have to pay any of that stuff. The only people this benefits are the owners of DEEM and Gaylor. Their workers will make less on state projects with more hours. And no overtime, but expected to work Saturdays."

I really don't feel strongly one way or the other, but now I want it to happen because the unions obviously think I'm stupid."

So if this passes to achieve the desired savings construction workers who build your roads, bridges, schools, hospitals would be making somewhere in the ballpark of 5.50-9.50 an hour. Do you really think a guy making that kind of money is going to give a shit how good the weld (or even know what the proper weld is) on that giant I-beam over your heads? Or how about the tensile strength of the hangers for pipes/ducts? The lobbying group that introduced this bill actually has info about how to get guest worker visas for your construction employees. Not that I am against foreign workers because I am not. I'm just saying someone from a third world country who has no education in the construction trades should not be working on our projects. So many DUMB things about this bill. Just another reason my family and I are thinking of moving. Which makes me terribly sad because this is home. :("

When Indiana is #3 and New York is #50, they're not saying, ""New York is the worst state, economically,"" they're saying, ""Indiana is poised for substantial growth. Invest in Indiana. New York is not expected to grow much in the near future."" As others have mentioned, ALAC is a known conservative political organization, and their indexes almost certainly have a large degree if bias. Consider that their economic outlook rankings have almost exclusively red states at the top and blue states at the bottom. A precursory look at how they calculate their index shows that they place a heavy emphasis on tax and regulatory burdens. Taxes and regulations are most certainly not the only dimension of the competitiveness of a state."

Indiana,31r3fj,ADPowers001,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:59:05 2015 UTC,I was in a political organization on campus. Leaders and some people running for office encouraged us to register to vote at our Bloomington addresses to vote for them because we lived there most of the year. This was years ago.   Always seemed kind of weird to me because we were just students. Then again we weren't spending much time in our hometowns either. I can guarantee no one in Bloomington was affected by this and both parties were doing it.

It will make voting on an Indiana ballot more inconvenient for a student who is an Indiana resident going to college out of state. And it will also make voting on an Indiana ballot more inconvenient for students originally from out of state who have been long time Indiana residents. In short, it will make voters who are far more likely to vote for Democrats have a harder time voting in Indiana. Same as our existing voter ID law. And that's exactly the way state Republicans want it."
Indiana,31r3fj,hansorg,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:11:51 2015 UTC,"Disagree completely. The only inconvenience I'm seeing in this bill is that you have to pick an address. If that's inconvenient to anyone, I'm not sure how that person ever makes it to the polls in the first place. As law currently is written, you do not qualify as a voter in a precinct for which you are there for temporary employment, education or renovating a property to move into unless you're intending to make it a permanent home (which is basically unenforceable). This language says you can do that, but you have to pick. Can't vote ""back home"" and at school. Which is something towns like Bloomington and West Lafayette struggle dealing with. They always have a metric ton of provisional ballots because of the uncertainty."

Nothing makes up for a lack of nurturing from a mother. I'm glad to see Indiana has a program like this."
Indiana,31mr9q,djtterb,8,Tue Apr 7 05:11:11 2015 UTC,"would have been more progress if she was simply on house arrest, seems silly to me to do it this way for a non violent offender."
Indiana,31mr9q,Bashasaurus,1 point,Tue Apr 7 06:51:18 2015 UTC,"The issue is see with this program is that there are a lot of mothers that would love to stay home during the first year of their baby's life, but cannot afford to do so either because they are a single mother, or they need two incomes to support a family.  She committed a crime.  She now gets to spend more time with her baby, she doesn't have to work, and gets housing and food paid for (compliments of us taxpayers).  And the nursery sounds like it has some nice amenities, taking into consideration that it is a prison.  I absolutely agree that she is unlikely to continue a life of crime.  I just think it's unfair to many other mothers who have not committed a crime."

Pence is on vacation for at least a week, I hear. So he lost last week and this week.  They've effectively undone several years of economic development and lost votes for next year's elections if not many local races this year. More cities will strengthen protections for LGBT which will be used to show the momentum change, losing more support from the Christian Right.

If not for Ball State's influence, it might be very different.  New Castle, however, is rough.  Very little industry, very white trash.  I don't say that to be mean, but it's just true. I personally feel more conspicuous in New Castle than I do anywhere in East Central Indiana.  Anderson's reinventing itself too after losing all of the GM/Delco jobs.  They have the Nestle plant, which has helped, and many travel down 69-S for jobs.  Anderson's been through rough times, but it's getting better there too, in my opinion.    TL;DR:  Muncie is fine.

When we lived in Fort Wayne, I moved a big geocaching event from Davisburg Michigan to the Kendallville Fairgrounds. Year 1, I set up some things on my camp site and was working outside until maybe 2am. Sometime between 2 and 6, someone stole a bunch of stuff. I went to report it at the PD and the officer said he had to move out of town because crime was so bad. However it worked out, it was only the beginning of August and it was already the hundredth or so police report filed. He told us how many reports get filed annually. It worked out to 3 reports per capita annually. Annually.   The the police were also stalking geocachers AT THE FAIRGROUNDS. The mayor had told them that we'd rented the fairgrounds for the week but they took that as license to harass our folks even where we rented. The mayor took care of it but only after the CVB made some calls.   Lots of good things, too. Bought a motorcycle for a great price a week later. They lent us some stuff to cart things around when we struck out at getting golf carts the first year.   It got moved to Waseon, Ohio after twice in Kendallville and there was a lot less hassle."

Indiana,31gabp,Metabro,1 point,Sun Apr 5 05:49:46 2015 UTC,"Well post a link hill jackie: Racial Incident In Indiana MARTINSVILLE'S SAD SEASON  Martinsville, Ind., ought to be basking in the accomplishments of the girls' basketball team at the town's namesake high school. Through Sunday the team had won 45 straight games and was ranked second nationally by USA Today. Instead, this basketball-crazy town, the hometown of John Wooden, is reeling from a harrowing racial incident during a boys' basketball game that has put Martinsville High on probation with the state athletic association and imperiled the future of the school's athletic program.  According to an Indiana High School Athletics Association (IHSAA) report, on Jan. 23, as Bloomington High North's racially mixed team got off the bus upon arriving for a game at Martinsville, about a dozen Martinsville students greeted the visitors with a barrage of racial epithets. Sue Beerman, principal of Bloomington North, said that the comments included: ""Here come the darkies."" Not surprisingly, the evening was marked by animosity.  During the junior varsity game several Bloomington players were bitten by Martinsville players. During the varsity game a member of Martinsville's all-white team elbowed a black North player in the stomach so fiercely that the player began vomiting. As he was doubled over on the sidelines, a fan yelled, ""That nigger's spitting on the floor! Get his ass off the floor.""  According to a report that Bloomington North filed with the IHSAA, epithets like ""baboon"" and threats such as ""You're not safe in this town"" continued after the game, which Martinsville won 69-66. ""It wasn't just nasty,"" says one Bloomington North fan, an adult who was in attendance, ""it was downright scary.""  The severity of the sanctions handed down by both Conference Indiana (the league in which Martinsville plays) and the IHSAA, among them a ban on Martinsville's hosting conference games in any sport until February 1999, is without precedent for an Indiana high school. The IHSAA has also warned that another incident of this sort involving a Martinsville team could result in suspension of play for that team.  This wasn't the first time that charges of racist behavior were leveled against one of Martinsville's teams. In the last year at least two high schools in central Indiana have dropped the Artesians from their schedules after games were marred by brawls and racial slurs. School administrators in Martinsville--which has few black residents among its population of 12,000 and has long had a reputation for Ku Klux Klan activity--were unwilling to discuss the incident or its aftermath.  Beerman says ""the matter has been resolved to our satisfaction,"" but the actions of her school's girls' team, which is racially mixed, speak louder: The Cougars chose to end their season and forgo a chance at a state championship rather than take part in the first of their sectional games, scheduled to be played at Martinsville High."
Indiana,31gabp,WintryFields,2,Mon Apr 6 17:04:10 2015 UTC,"I was at that game.  The crowd was chanting here come the Arties in the gym because surprisingly the mascot is the artesian well.    And while in the stands I heard no racial insults, just complaints to the ref that you would normally hear in a bball game where both teams are being physical.  Because of the stupid 1950s case of that Hendricks county truck driver killing the black bible saleswoman people have heard what they want to believe in martinsville.  And it's just silly.    I've been sexually and racially harassed much more often in my few nights in Bloomington than all my years in martinsville.  And like a reasonable adult, I don't judge the whole town for it."

It's not an outright racism, but rather a lock your car doors and talk about ""them"" at the dinner table kind of thing. This in no way applies to everyone, but I've seen people gasp and step away when I tell them I live on the east side and go to Warren Central.

Indiana,31e642,ceilte,9,Sat Apr 4 07:51:02 2015 UTC,"So when you say corporate religious rights, remember we're not talking about Eli Lily here.  Companies that are publicly traded or have decent sized boards cannot have religious beliefs from a court perspective because of the diversity of their ownership.  Based on what we saw in the Hobby Lobby case the business needs to be either a ""closely held"" corporation or have some other type of limited ownership like a small partnership or sole proprietors.    edit Also for clarity, nothing in the tack on they did to the bill changed that in any way, that's the way it's always been."
Indiana,31e642,Old1e,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:21:07 2015 UTC,"Companies that are publicly traded or have decent sized boards cannot have religious beliefs from a court perspective because of the diversity of their ownership.   That's not true. That reasoning was used for the federal RFRA to expand the definition of a ""person"" to apply to companies. The Indiana law explicitly includes companies, so ""closely held"" is not a restriction."
Indiana,31e642,NaturalSelectorX,0,Fri Apr 10 15:12:43 2015 UTC,So you're telling me that a court would allow a company with 30 board members and thousands of shareholders to claim religious freedom?  You're smoking crack.
Indiana,31e642,Old1e,2,Fri Apr 10 16:44:57 2015 UTC,"Under the Indiana RFRA, that is true. Here is the entire section:   Sec. 7. As used in this chapter, ""person"" includes the following: (1) An individual. (2) An organization, a religious society, a church, a body of communicants, or a group organized and operated primarily for religious purposes. (3) A partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association, or another entity that: (A) may sue and be sued; and (B) exercises practices that are compelled or limited by a system of religious belief held by: (i) an individual; or (ii) the individuals; who have control and substantial ownership of the entity, regardless of whether the entity is organized and operated for profit or nonprofit purposes.   Notice how you only need ""substantial control or ownership"" of the business, not that it be closely held."
Indiana,31e642,NaturalSelectorX,0,Fri Apr 10 17:09:26 2015 UTC,So no offense intended (because it really isn't) but you're reading this from a plain English perspective and not a legal one.  Get any 2 bit lawyer in here and they'll agree with me.    What control and substantial ownership means to you isn't what it means to a judge.
Indiana,31e642,Old1e,2,Fri Apr 10 17:58:53 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear what ""control"" and ""substantial ownership"" mean, even to a judge. For example, if the board members of Marriott International didn't want to open event areas for gay weddings, this law would apply to them.    So no offense intended (because it really isn't) but you're reading this from a plain English perspective and not a legal one.   Laws are written in English. Unless you can show me a way in which this law would exclude publicly traded companies, your interpretation is wrong.   You are trying to apply the precedent set by the SCOTUS decision, but that doesn't apply to the Indiana law. The federal RFRA did not define ""person"", and the court interpreted it to also apply to closely-held businesses since they were close enough to the apparent intention of protecting individuals.   The Indiana RFRA actually defines ""person"" to include organizations and businesses. There is no need to postulate if the legislators intended to also protect businesses, because it's spelled out in the law. That is why they are different."
Indiana,31e642,NaturalSelectorX,0,Fri Apr 10 18:20:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I'm a big company.  My board has on it 2 atheists, a muslim, 4 catholics, 2 pentecostals, 2 jews, and 3 people who sort of believe there's something out there.  I want to argue that providing drugs/devices that terminate established pregnancies substantially interferes with the organizations ability to exercise it's religious beliefs.  5 of my 12 boardembers are on board with our decision, 4 don't particularly care, and 3 are dead set against the policy.  The judge will take one look at that and laugh my ass out of court.  Unless they're basically a religious organization in general the idea that a publicly held organization could ever claim a religious exemption is laughable, and nothing in this law changes that.  Yes in strict interpretation in does but when confronted with any kind of reality based situation it would never work."
Indiana,31e642,Old1e,2,Fri Apr 10 18:59:14 2015 UTC,"This is where a judge would interpret whether or not you have sufficient control. I would imagine if there is enough support on the board to actually implement the policy within the company, there would be enough control among those individuals to qualify for protection. In other words, if your group has enough power to dictate the official company mission; you probably qualify for protection."
Indiana,31e642,NaturalSelectorX,0,Fri Apr 10 19:04:59 2015 UTC,"Probably, but you're going to have to prove you have the same deeply held belief that substantially interferes with your ability to practice your religion.  Of course if you have public shareholders you're also SOL unless you can prove they all feel the same.  So...again...we're back to closely held corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietors.  Glad you've agreed with me."
Indiana,31e642,Old1e,4,Fri Apr 10 19:11:23 2015 UTC,"The same as it was previously. There are countless examples of this thing being applied elsewhere like the Muslim not shaving his beard in prison, or the native American smoking peyote"

The church of cognizance also involved 100+ pounds of weed and various other factors showing it was just a commercial front for drug dealing, with money going to pay bail for people.  I haven't found a case for legitimate personal use of small quantities where RFRA was shot down.  Maybe someone with west law or lexis nexis can?

The clarification doesn't make it illegal to discriminate against gays, it just says that you can't use this law as the basis of your discrimination. Since gays are not a protected class in this state, you can discriminate against them at will, with few exceptions (such as housing) because there aren't any laws against it."
Indiana,31bwe9,estranho,6,Sat Apr 4 05:30:57 2015 UTC,"The other big exception would be those municipalities that had existing anti-discrimination laws above and beyond the state's, like Indianapolis."

Indiana,31bwe9,SpartanBurger,5,Sat Apr 4 13:57:04 2015 UTC,"Supporters of the law said from the start that the law wasn't about discrimination, but the opponents said that it opens it up to discrimination and could be interpreted as such. The clarification was added to make it clear that it's not about discrimination. All of the people yelling that ""Pence caved"" are proof that they wanted it for discrimination.

There was no rational persuasion used anywhere in the movement to change the RFRA.  There was plenty of economic and media bullying.  There was plenty of rage and demonstrations.  But there was no argument for public good, no argument for justice, no argument from human nature.  Just overly emotional outcry that someone would be inconvenienced because others still manage to have objective moral standards.    The only argument for the LGBT movement was one for legal indifference out of respect for privacy.  So give someone what they want that was thought to be indifferent to the public got sodomy laws etc repealed.  This has all changed with the move to treat same sex couples as if they were married.  If we were rational, we would only do that if there was some good to be had in those couples, but there is not.  They can not in principle perform the act that justifies societal recognition of sexual pairs.  So we are acting irrationally and the need for the RFRA and the outrage at it's passing is a further expression at that irrationality.  So our nation slides further into shit."

Indiana,31dqs3,DStoo,1 point,Sat Apr 4 13:36:55 2015 UTC,"No. That's what distinguishes GoFundMe from Kickstarter. All proceeds raised on Kickstarter - even those over the goal - MUST be used on the project you started the Kickstarter for.  That's intended to reinforce the idea that donating to a Kickstarter means your funding will actually go to the project and you won't be scammed, but it becomes a hindrance for wildly successful Kickstarter projects - for example, Anita Sarkeesian gets a lot of flak for not spending all of the money her Kickstarter raised - the implication being that she pocketed the rest - but it's actually a violation of the Kickstarter TOS and therefore a breach of contract if she were to use it to, say, fund another Feminist Frequency project or whatever. She could be sued for that. There's only so much money can buy when it comes to making YouTube videos, so the rest of the money just kind of...sits there. Unable to be used for anything.  GoFundMe has no such clause in their TOS. That makes it more open for scams, but also more open for hugely successful fundraisers to operate with more sense."

Indiana,319047,MrDrProfessor,3,Thu Apr 2 23:44:29 2015 UTC,"That map is not as accurate to that statement (it's also outdated and missing Utah). That map shows states that have employment discrimination laws in place for all employment where sexual orientation is a protected class in the case of employment. However there are several states where sexual orientation and gender identity are treated as protected classes in employment opportunity for employment with the state itself (ie schools). Indiana is one of these states. Due to Executive Order 13672 all civilian federal jobs (ie postal service) can not discriminate due to sexual orientation or gender identity, which will soon carry over to those businesses that have federal contracts and the appropriate number or employees. Also consider the non-discrimination policies in effect in the private sector; 89% of Fortune 500 companies do this for sexual orientation and 66% for gender identity.   With the addition of Utah all of the States on that map have state legislature that makes sexual orientation and gender identity a protected class when dealing with housing providers (NY, NH, and WI only having sexual orientation however). Although any federally-assisted housing program, in any state, can not discriminate. Adding on to that any housing organization that receive HUD funding are also not allowed to discriminate based on sexual orientation due to HUD regulations. Lastly there's hate (bias) crime legislation. 45/50 states actually have any hate crime legislation, of those 30/45 cover sexual orientation and 16/45 cover gender identity. Indiana actually has no hate crime legislation but does collect hate crime data. The state does define what a bias crime is but there are no enhanced penalties to the crime, unless however it warrants federal investigation in which case the Matthew Shepard Act kicks in."

Indiana,319047,WintryFields,4,Fri Apr 3 04:12:15 2015 UTC,"The RFRA actually was more specific in limiting Government overreach than the First Amendment. The rights delineated in the Constitution always had limitations, and the Federal RFRA was more to push that line closer to individual liberties than government intrusion.  I'll repost the history I wrote in /r/Indianapolis ... IMO, it's interesting, but I enjoy reading about law, so hey:  The RFRA (42 USC 2000bb et seq) itself isn't the problem, it's the expanded language they put into it: I'd go so far as to say that without the expansions the RFRA would be seen as a pretty positive law. The federal RFRA was, after all, designed to help protect religious minorities from heavy-handed government encroachment, which I think everyone agrees is a good thing.  The problem is that by opening it up to non-government-related lawsuits and greatly expanding the types of ""persons"" that may use the affirmative defense it opens itself up to abuse and judicial reinterpretation.  One of the situations that originally led to the Federal RFRA was two Native Americans who took part in a peyote-smoking ceremony and were subsequently fired from their jobs as counselors at a private drug rehab clinic, where they tested positive for mescaline (from the peyote). In applying for unemployment benefits, they were denied with the Oregon Employment Board finding that they were terminated due to work-related misconduct. (See Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon vs. Smith, 494 U.S. 872.) The Employment Division was overturned on appeal, then many fascinating things happened if you're into procedural law, culminating in certiatori and review by the U.S. Supreme Court.  After review, remand, and reinterpretation, the Supremes put their recording gig on hold in order to decide that as the law against mescaline ingestion was generally applicable and not aimed at the Native Americans in this case, the previous decision was correct and that law (as well as the denial of the unemployment benefits) was correct.  So, at this point one could fairly interpret this to mean that the government decided to stomp over a religious belief. It also means that the ultimate blame should reside on Oregon, not Indiana. (Sorry, Oregon!)  Congress whipped up the RFRA (passing 97 to 3 in the Senate) and Clinton signed it, where everyone lived happily ever after...  ...until the Supreme Court determined in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 that the law was actually overly broad and that Congress didn't have the Constitutional authority via the supremacy clause that it thought it had, and couldn't apply the law to the states.   At this point, we have a good law that was crippled when applied to the state and lower levels of government. The states quickly modified the RFRA to apply at their level also, leaving the language fairly unchanged where possible.  Then Indiana came along and tried to pass its version, one where a business could use the religious belief affirmative defense, not just individuals. So, they wanted to comply with that Hobby Lobby decision and protect closely-held and religious companies. They also removed the requirement that the government be a party to the suit.  Either of those, alone, wouldn't be a huge problem, but when taken together it could allow for just the sort of rejection of clients based on religious belief. Note that this doesn't imply that there's a license for bakers to refuse to make wedding cakes for lesbian couples: They would still have a day in court and have to prove their case, which is actually fairly unlikely, but it's a possibility. What's worse though is that as a state law it effectively overrides local municipal codes that might be brought by the plaintiff against the gay-refusing baker in this theoretical suit. The municipal codes (such as the Indianapolis Human Rights Ordinance ) might well be struck down by a court due to the conflict with the RFRA.   Or it was, anyway, as the anti-discrimination provision seems to have mostly plugged that hole. As far as what is going to happen now that companies can make religious claims just as people have and without needing the government as a party, though, I have no idea and only time (and our judiciary) can tell."
Indiana,319047,Umpa,-1,Fri Apr 3 12:30:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I completely agree. Though, many would say that the 1st Amendment has been trampled on in the past 20 years by certain government entities and affiliations, consequently having people demand more protection for religious freedom.

I realize that John Mellencamp was born and raise there, and therefore, I thought it was more of a liberal state.   However, looking into the history of Indiana, it is Conservative and Racist as all fuck.  Out of all of the Midwestern states you are solidly conservative.    You have Southern influences creeping up, which separates you from the more liberal area Midwestern states such as Iowa and Minnesota.   What is shocking is the large KKK influence on Indiana.  At one point in time, one in three white men where apart of the Klan in Indiana.     Therefore, it is really not surprising that Hoosiers target gays.

Reddit is very liberal and likes to dig into the past of a certain hated topic and dig up a lot of dirt on that subject in order to make it seem worse than it actually is. It doesn't bug me so much because I'm finding out a lot of cool information, but I realize that there's usually a lot more to the story. Comments usually help a lot with clarification or showing that there's more than what is initially claimed."

Comments usually provide some alternate viewpoints but they are sometimes buried at the bottom.

Indiana,3179rq,SpartanBurger,3,Thu Apr 2 19:44:22 2015 UTC,"The nice thing though is that they give you the chance to filter the comments by different categories. Which is a great feature. The problem is that I think most people prefer to have the comments sorted by ""Best"". I can't blame them because that's what I have my comments set as, haha. It'd be nice if there was a way to select certain comments to be like ""featured"" or something. I know that there's gold, but not everyone is willing to just give it out."
Indiana,3179rq,ass_pineapples,2,Thu Apr 2 19:47:05 2015 UTC,Yeah the different sorting systems are useful.  I do think the system works well for the majority of topics but maybe not so much for controversial news/politics.

Indiana,3179rq,ass_pineapples,-2,Thu Apr 2 19:49:41 2015 UTC,Although it's completely justified thanks to Pence.    Something a childish liberal would say. Pence has done a lot of great work for this state. It's not his fault that some liberal bloggers misrepresented this bill.

Indiana,317066,bernie16wb,3,Thu Apr 2 18:43:28 2015 UTC,"Actually, no, the Supreme Court decided in City of Boerne v. Flores (521 U.S. 507) that Congress had overstepped its bounds by applying the Act to the States. They held that the supremacy clause had, in this case, been over-extended by in effect modifying the interpretation of the 14th Amendment. It's a good argument, but its failure is the trigger for this wave of state-level RFRA laws.  Prior to the corrected language, assuming it goes forward, the bill is as described by Chuck Schumer, the author of the Federal RFRA: Justifying discrimination in the name of religious freedom. [1]. After the language? I'm not sure what it would do. I suspect we'll find out soon, though."

Indiana,317066,bernie16wb,2,Thu Apr 2 19:50:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say, as WP does, that it's more an issue of Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Association (485 U.S. 439), but certainly that decision built on Boerne v. Flores in challenging the extent of the supremacy clause. I'd note that IMO there are some instances where the amendment wouldn't be needed, though, as a number of agreements with Native American tribes were created as treaties, and I can't think of any instances where treaty law was subsequently (successful or not) overruled by state law since the Civil War.  Also, I'm not a treaty law expert or diplomat, so you shouldn't base your treaties with indigenous peoples on my opinions."

Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association, 485 U.S. 439 (1988), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled on the applicability of the Free Exercise Clause to the practice of religion on Native American sacred lands, specifically in the Chimney Rock area of the Six Rivers National Forest in California. This area, also known as the High Country was used since time immemorial by the Yurok, Karuk, and Tolowa tribes as a religious site.

The only things I ever saw them use were vague talking points about freedom and liberty and no ""here's a situation where this bill would have helped""."
Indiana,317066,4mb1guous,10,Thu Apr 2 17:02:18 2015 UTC,"The Native American ""joke"" was actually what led to the Federal RFRA signed by Clinton.  The Amish have acquiesced to putting up SMV emblems on their buggies and carry lanterns, but otherwise wish to keep to themselves and eschew modern technology... or more accurately, they don't want to invest themselves in that which isn't necessary.  This bill doesn't provide protected class status to GLBTQ folks and our veteran community (another new addition that people haven't noticed, I think) but I'd like to think now we're at least in a slightly better position than we were before: If we can persuade the IGA to pass a human rights law for those two groups also, I think it would actually work with the RFRA to put us in a very short list of states that strive to respect everyone.  Which, IMO, is a pretty noble goal."
Indiana,317066,Vitapak,5,Thu Apr 2 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"The weird thing to me is that Scalia issued the majority opinion in the case regarding the native americans basically saying they weren't exempt from following the law even though it prohibits them from exercising their religion because ""where will it end"" and everybody would want an exception etc. 25 years later somehow the same guy thinks corporations are people, they can be religious AND they can opt out of laws because of their religion.

Indiana,317066,Vitapak,2,Thu Apr 2 18:17:45 2015 UTC,The buggy one is really silly IMO. We have safety standards for our roads and they shouldn't be able to be overridden just because your religion doesn't believe in them.   If lights should be required on our roadways for safety reasons then the Amish should have to use them or stay off the road.
Indiana,317066,silkysmoothjay,5,Thu Apr 2 17:24:55 2015 UTC,"They do, the standards were written with the Amish buggies in mind. We also have SMV farm equipment such as tractors, and if you'd like to say that farm equipment should stay off roadways... in Indiana... then you're on your own. :)"
Indiana,317066,hoosierstateofmind,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:30:32 2015 UTC,"I'm in Ohio, I'm aware of farming. Most of the tractors have lights anyway, at least that I've used. However that's kind of irrelevant to my point.   The point was that if the people who make road safety regulations deemed that no vehicle should be without lights in any circumstance (I don't think that's the case since they have exemptions for things such as tractors, etc) then what your religion says about lights shouldn't matter. Your religion doesn't get to trump everyone else's safety."
Indiana,317066,Vitapak,2,Thu Apr 2 17:58:40 2015 UTC,"True, and if push came to shove I could see the Amish adopting clip-on electric lights if they were ultimately mandated.  On the other hand, they're a surprisingly powerful political force in the area from here to Pennsylvania, so I don't think legislators are interested in pushing the issue."
Indiana,317066,Vitapak,2,Thu Apr 2 18:05:45 2015 UTC,They're one of those forces that there is somewhat of an unspoken agreement with. You don't show up in droves to vote and we'll do our very best to keep your lifestyle in mind when we do legislative work. There was an interesting podcast on this American Life about how disruptive groups like that can be to our political system. A group of hasidic Jews pretty well burned a school corporation to the ground when they were pushed enough to get involved in local politics. Some groups like the Amish could very well do a lot of work in Northern Indiana and parts of Southern Indiana if they so chose.
Indiana,317066,Girl_Named_Sandoz,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:55:49 2015 UTC,"IDK about Pennsylvanian Amish, but I know in general that the Amish, by a virtue of their interpretation of pacifism, are conscientious objectors to voting. Thus, while it is likely that if legislation targeted them or harmed them in a way, a larger portion of the Amish would vote, I believe that the majority would continue to not vote. Protests might be likely however."

If you google, ""Gay couple suing business"" you'll see multiple examples of businesses choosing not to cater a wedding and getting sued because of it.

This is from their website:   Eric Miller, the Founder and Executive Director of Advance America stated:  “It is vitally important to protect religious freedom in Indiana.  It’s the right thing to do.  It was therefore important to pass Senate Bill 101 in 2015 in order to help protect churches, Christian businesses and individuals from those who want to punish them because of their Biblical beliefs!”  Churches, Christian businesses and individuals deserve protection from those who support homosexual marriages and those who support government recognition and approval of gender identity (men who dress as women).  SB 101 will help provide the protection!  Here are just three examples where SB 101 will help:  Christian bakers, florists and photographers should not be punished for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage! A Christian business should not be punished for refusing to allow a man to use the women’s restroom! A church should not be punished because they refuse to let the church be used for a homosexual wedding!"
Indiana,317066,hoosierstateofmind,3,Thu Apr 2 18:03:07 2015 UTC,"Those bakers, florists, and photographers offer their services to the public. If they want to not offer it to some people because of race, religion, nationality, etc they should be a private club.   Who is asking men to be allowed to use the restroom?   And a church is generally considered a different type of entity than a business no? I don't think they're usually held to the same standards."
Indiana,317066,Clavis_Apocalypticae,2,Thu Apr 2 18:12:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, Eric Miller and his group grossly misinterpreted the legislation. His people are the reason that this blew up the way it did. I would be shocked if this doesn't create a very real and very strong schism in the state Republican party over social issues. Daniels called it a truce back in 2008. I think a lot of Rs will push for something more than a truce going forward. The hard rights rhetoric has just been too much."
Indiana,317066,hoosierstateofmind,2,Thu Apr 2 18:58:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, the ""private club"" is how a lot of bars in the south got around having to admit black people. I agree with you, a church is totally different and I don't think in ANY circumstances a church could ever be compelled to hold a gay wedding unless they want to. Also, I think the outrage about ""men using a woman's restroom"" is aligned with the push in some places (NV,FL,TX) that is going on to make it illegal for a transgendered person to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with."
Indiana,317066,Clavis_Apocalypticae,2,Thu Apr 2 19:01:17 2015 UTC,The bigger question now; will it pass?

I'm sure there are other social conservative groups that will lodge a protest if they haven't already.    I'm on the fence if there will be enough social conservatives willing to back down to get it to pass.

He was a very introverted, sweet, loving person. He found out he had HIV but didn't want anyone to know that he was gay, so he didn't seek treatment. We lived in the deep south, and while our nuclear family was not very religious, our extended family consisted of strict southern baptists. After a while he got sick and moved back home, telling my mom that he had got the flu and it wasn't going away. He was rushed to the hospital when he became extremely ill one night, and the doctors told my mother that he had tested positive for AIDS. My mother, not knowing that my brother already knew, tearfully told him that he had AIDS, and he just quietly said ""I know, mom. I'm so sorry"". He died less than 4 months later, never being able to overcome that initial sickness that landed him in the hospital. Many of my strictly religious family members changed their outlook on gay rights after that, and while a few of them don't support gay marriage, they always support me when I speak about how important the fight for gay rights is to me."

She is then parked in a Kohls parking lot which would be safer for him as well.  The whole process was delayed a few minutes by driving to Kohls.

Indiana,319sx6,Danishsnow,7,Fri Apr 3 03:29:26 2015 UTC,"Hello, and welcome to /r/Indiana. The Religions Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is supposed to help solidify our 1st amendment right to practice religion. It acts as a defense if a business/individual/corporation says no to doing an action that goes against their closely held religious beliefs. For example, a Jewish delicatessen worker can refuse to handle pork products and feel completely safe behind the law while doing so, or another case was a Muslim convict was told to shave his beard off while incarcerated. He stated that he was a Muslim and he was allowed to keep the beard as long as he shaved it down to a half inch (1.27 cm).   The real rub everyone is having with RFRA is that Indiana has no LGBT protections state-wide. So, a Christian baker may refuse to make a cake for a gay wedding. For a more extreme example, a Christian business owner may also refuse to hire a homosexual.   Most people want it changed to protect homosexuality, however, the legislators were not going to change it until corporations threatened to withdraw from Indiana. During the one week it has been since RFRA was signed, we stand to lose 254 million dollars.   There are proposed changes to it currently being reviewed, but they haven't been signed as of this posting.  That is the basics of it.

Not sure how some ones sexuality prevent some one from serving them any kind of food.  Homosexuals use the same money as everyone else with the same buying power.  Chalk this up to this is the will of the Free Market that conservatives love so much.  The owner expressed his opinions(though I wonder when he decided to be Heterosexual...I think I decided that the same time I decided I to be tall) which is 100% his right under the freedom of speech.  He is not getting any reprocussions from his government over his stance, but the people of the state are just using that same freedom against him.  He expressed an opinion that is unpopular and now he has to pay the price for it.

Indiana,317zod,Clavis_Apocalypticae,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"Indiana state senate passes very vague Religious Freedom Restoration Act bill that is similar to, but not the same as those passed in many other states and the federal level. The main difference being that it allows the unnecessary burden on an individuals religion to be used in court even if neither party is the government.  Many individuals and LGBT organizations realize that, because the bill is extremely vague and sexual orientation is not a protected class in Indiana, businesses in Indiana could potentially use the bill to refuse service to gay customers. This information makes its way to major news agencies, gets spread around the internet, twisted around with a lot of misinformation to make it sound even worse than it already was, and leads to several other states speaking out against Indiana, as well as tons of businesses and individuals ""boycotting"" the state.  Governor Pence tries to interject himself into the news to clarify that the bill's original purpose was not to discriminate against anyone, but to provide a legal defense for individuals who believe that their religious beliefs have been unfairly burdened.  As of today, an amendment to the bill has been proposed to clarify that it is not to be used to discriminate ""on the basis of race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or United States military service"". In many people's eyes this is a good compromise as it prevents the main issue that most people have with the original bill, while still allowing for the more legitimate uses of the bill. Others are opposed to the added language because they believe that it should be their right to refuse service on any grounds that they see fit.  As far as people actually leaving the state, I haven't personally heard of anyone going that far, but I can't say it isn't possible.  tl;dr, Indiana senate passes bill that could allow for discrimination, huge backlash, a little bit of backpedalling, (hopefully) a relatively sane conclusion."

That toxicologist said he did a lot of research and couldn’t find any scientifically reliable ways to test her blood for those drugs.  He then tried to do the test his own way and said he couldn’t find any traces in her system.

Indiana,315c6j,Vitapak,-4,Thu Apr 2 02:49:51 2015 UTC,My religious liberty is at risk because:   A) Being a member of my faith means that I can be bullied without legal recourse. B) I am no longer allowed to use my faith to bully gay kids with impunity.  So citing religious reasons for not serving a hypothetical wedding that is against your personal beliefs and then receiving death and arson threats where those people delivering them will most likely not be legally punished IS in fact threatening to religious liberty.  I wasn't sure until now.
Indiana,315c6j,bernie16wb,6,Thu Apr 2 16:13:17 2015 UTC,They have legal recourse against the people that threatened them though. People being absolute assholes and doing that is terrible but not really relevant to the discussion of the law IMO.

Multiplied by the thousands of times every day that this happens across the state.  I'm on board if you are."
Indiana,315c6j,Vitapak,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:10:21 2015 UTC,"I'm a live at let live person.    I don't care if your LGBT or straight or whatever color or region you come from...I just want everyone to be productive members of society.  I think that people have a hard time accepting that the entire world isn't going to like you or agree with what you believe in, be it religions or sexual orientation.  That said, I also think people have a hard time accepting that people are different and will have varying beliefs.  Both are unfortunate realities that people need to get over.  I don't agree with threats, shames, or basic liberty denials in any form because it conflicts with my ""productive member of society"" belief.  At the same time, I don't think that a business should be forced to service an individual in the same manner that an individual isn't forced to purchase something from that business.  Economic freedom goes both ways for me.  I don't purchase from businesses that have anti-firearm policies and beliefs because that's an important issue to me.  That doesn't mean that I want the place to burn down or them to go out of business.  They made an economic decision based on their beliefs and I respect that, I just won't spend my money there.  Life goes on.    I've said it in another thread a few days ago, I'd rather know that a shop owner is a legit bigot therefore letting me know not to shop there verses him having to hide it and earning my money.  That said, I have no issue with what the owners the pizza store said.  They have no problems serving LGBT, just didn't want to cater a wedding that they don't believe in religiously.  They have that freedom, IMO, in the same way that the LGBT couple has the freedom to get the pizza from another store.  Do I think it's the right decision?  No, but to me it's theirs to make."
Indiana,315c6j,marvin02,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:35:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say that generally works. I would love to have a better guide to which businesses I should give my money. But you don't need a law to allow a company to publicly state that the owners are bigots, and this law wasn't going to make any company owners state their beliefs publicly. That pizza place was never going to be asked to cater a gay wedding, so if they didn't (stupidly) talk to some reporter looking for a story, who would know?  But creating a law legalizing discrimination and giving basically explicit approval to bigotry is a much bigger deal than just outing business owners that I don't agree with."

Indiana,315jd9,gpia7r,7,Thu Apr 2 03:50:06 2015 UTC,"'Compromise' is a funny term here -- if you read the article, it came out of a 'deal' between Republicans and business leaders.  Life in a supermajority, I guess"
Indiana,315jd9,kickit,2,Thu Apr 2 11:27:32 2015 UTC,"It's really just a compromise between them and the 21st century, if you think about it."
Indiana,315jd9,TeeSeventyTwo,2,Thu Apr 2 13:06:36 2015 UTC,"Indiana Republican leaders are set to announce a deal Thursday morning that alters Indiana's controversial ""religious freedom"" law to ensure it does not discriminate against gay and lesbian customers of Indiana businesses.  The proposal — which grants new protections for LGBT customers, employees and tenants — is set for a 9 a.m. rollout at the Statehouse and a 9:30 a.m. committee hearing. It closely mirrors a draft plan that was circulated early Wednesday morning and could potentially quell concerns that have made Indiana the focus of national derision for one very intense week."
Indiana,315jd9,ceilte,-1,Thu Apr 2 11:58:58 2015 UTC,"Likely to simply reinforce that the law has no intention of ""allowing"" discrimination. I somehow think the outrage will remain, regardless."
Indiana,315jd9,TeeSeventyTwo,1 point,Thu Apr 2 03:51:31 2015 UTC,"But it did have exactly that intention:  http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/what-makes-indianas-religious-freedom-law-different/388997/   Democrats also offered the Republican legislative majority a chance to amend the new act to say that it did not permit businesses to discriminate; they voted that amendment down.   Republicans had an opportunity to do literally exactly what they are doing right now, and they decided overwhelmingly against it. They're not ""fixing"" it because we all misunderstood their intentions, they're ""fixing"" it because we all picked up on what the RFRA was from the get-go and are making them own their own discrimination bill."

That is just how I feel. I do have sufficient empathy however to realize that homosexual people are in the same boat. They can't decide who turns them on any more than I can. It's just the way they are.  Which means that refusing to cater for their weddings is no different than refusing to cater black weddings. It is discrimination, plain and simple. I hope that these people take their  GoFundme money and retire. They should not be running a business that is open to the public."

Indiana,31546o,meme-com-poop,9,Thu Apr 2 05:24:52 2015 UTC,Death threats are despicable.   Bigotry is despicable.   Hopefully those making death threats will be punished for their misdeeds just as the bigots are being punished for theirs.
Indiana,31546o,Clavis_Apocalypticae,2,Thu Apr 2 02:17:22 2015 UTC,"First, did they contact the press or did the press contact them, initially. Second, did they record any of these threats. Ever since this story came out, I've been getting a vibe that they're just trying to play it up for the Chick-Fil-A effect and get a bunch of business once Fox news talks about them.    Edit Am I missing the part in the article where it says they were being threatened?     Phone calls and social media responses over the remarks have now forced the restaurant to shutter until temperatures cool.     That could just be people asking them to change their position. I doubt it, but it could be."
Indiana,31546o,meme-com-poop,-10,Thu Apr 2 05:26:14 2015 UTC,"The word ""bigot"" in response to these people is really a stretch.  They said they were happy to serve all customers, including LGBT, in their stores.  How does that make them a bigot?   They said they didn't want to cater a private event, such as a wedding. Who's to force them to do this?  They also claimed they had never been asked to cater such an event.  Let's not apply the word ""bigot"" to absolutely everyone because they have a religious background.  If they came out and said they hate gays, then by all means, call them a bigot.  But these people did NOT turn down gays once.  Not even once."
Indiana,31546o,gpia7r,6,Thu Apr 2 02:33:22 2015 UTC,"Weasel words, just like every other post you've made on the subject of RFRA.  Discriminating against people for their intrinsic being is wrong. I don't care what kind of pretzel logic you engage in to rationalize it, it simply isn't ok.  They said that because they are a ""Christian"" business, that they would never cater a same-sex wedding.  It doesn't matter that they've never been asked to cater one, or that they likely never would be asked to cater one. The prejudice is there, plain as day.  Anyone who holds prejudice against or discriminates against LGBT people is a bigot, just as those who hold prejudice against or discriminates against black people is a racist. Hiding behind the shield of their religion doesn't make any of it ok."
Indiana,31546o,Clavis_Apocalypticae,-5,Thu Apr 2 03:08:09 2015 UTC,"Yet these attacks on them are purely based on their religion.  What do you call those people?  I'd love to remain a ""live and let live"" person, but militant totalitarians are forcing me to choose a side.  They were targeted by the reporter because of their religious background.  They chose a company, shone a light on it, and said ""attack.""  The business should NEVER have talked to the reporter, and I hope they learn that lesson.  But they are a business that operates and serves ALL people, including LGBT, throughout their normal routine.  The reporter found a single example that would be outside the business' routine, and that's what everyone is claiming bigotry and discrimination on.  Most ridiculous part of this whole thing: the Pizza restaurant didn't even turn anyone away. They answered a hypothetical question.  This isn't anti-bigotry.  It's anti-religion.  Also, again, ad hom... really not necessary."
Indiana,31546o,gpia7r,6,Thu Apr 2 03:22:16 2015 UTC,"I'd love to remain a ""live and let live"" person, but militant totalitarians are forcing me to choose a side.

Indiana,31546o,Cletusvandayam,2,Thu Apr 2 03:41:29 2015 UTC,"Religion isn't an intrinsic quality, it is a learned behavior. There's a big difference.  The reporter didn't put words in their mouths, they spoke their mind in the name of their religion of peace and love.  If I call you an idiot, that's ad-hominem. I didn't do that.  I did, however,  say that your arguments suck, because they do. They're some of the most intellectually dishonest that I've ever had the displeasure of reading in my 5+ years on Reddit. Which is really saying something, because I used to spend a lot of time in /r/politics.   Attacking your argument is called debate, not ad-hominem. Learn the difference."

They're closing because of threats of arson and death on them because they probably wouldn't cater a gay wedding... but are happy to serve gay customers in their stores.   Gee golly, that's just the worst.  The threats were definitely warranted.  The journalist responsible for this crap is probably pretty happy with themselves."

Not just in Presidential elections, you need to vote in the boringass midterms, too.  Encourage others who feel the same to vote.  Call, email, and write physical letters to your elected representatives to respectfully express your views on issues.   Attend town hall meetings. Ask questions.  Volunteer in campaigns you support.   Write letters to the editor in your local paper praising politicians who support things you like and to respectfully call out those who don't.   Don't ever assume that ANYONE in government is any smarter or more knowledgeable than you are. About ANYTHING. They're just average people with above average ambition and usually their fair share of luck. Don't ever let someone win a debate by 'appealing to authority'.  Your greatest civic duty is to always question your government and hold it accountable."

He's terrible, sure, but he's only a symptom.  We voted on the most important offices in Indiana during the 2014 election, the House & Senate. Dems lost 2 seats in the House, 3 in the Senate. Not that the Legislature couldn't have ramrodded this bill through without the extra seats due to the ridiculous amount of Gerrymandering that's gone on over the last decade, which is another massive issue altogether."

Those facilities offered HIV testing, education/counseling services, and served to track community drug usage/HIV rates.

One of our nation's biggest problems is that only people with whacky beliefs are voting in the primary. All the Republican politicians are so worried about a primary challenge from the right that they do crazy things.   If you were a Republican then by the time you had a choice between Pence and Gregg it was not going to go well for you.

Indiana,310bxt,Clavis_Apocalypticae,3,Wed Apr 1 10:50:32 2015 UTC,"Rant time...... Mike Pence just committed political suicide (obvious I know) he would have been WAY better off either tabling the bill and letting it go into effect by default or better yet using common sense and vetoing the damn thing.   It has always been legal to discriminate against gays in Indiana!!! They are not a Federally or State protected class under the civil rights laws (they might be soon). So the whole ""point"" of this law is pointless.  Then as long as you have 6 or less employees you can discriminate against anyone for whatever reason you want in your company. Dont want to hire that lesbian, black, jew for example?? Have less than 6 employees? You do good!! You dont have to hire her and you can even tell her to her face why. The best part is it is legal!!!   We need to get rid of the quite frankly toxic Democrats and Republicans in this state before they run the state, and the country into the ground. We need to accept that both parties have good and bad ideas and take the best of both and combine them into a modern political ideology that can move the country foreward instead of being stuck in a purgatory like political system.  End rant....."
Indiana,310bxt,knifeoholic,3,Wed Apr 1 06:17:35 2015 UTC,"The beautiful irony of this situation is that it will greatly accelerate the timetable for LGBT to become a protected class.  If you think about the Civil Rights movement in the 60s, a large portion of the country was largely apathetic toward the plight of black equality. It wasn't until they were confronted on a nightly basis with images of peaceful protesters getting their skulls cracked open and being torn apart by police dogs on national TV did the tide of wide-spread public opinion turn.  Humans have a finite capacity for the number of people that they can be empathetic or sympathetic with at any given time. But it can be these boiling point moments that get people to expand their little monkeysphere and consider the real-life consequences of their apathy, and perhaps realize that this about real human beings, with real lives, with real feelings, who only have fewer rights than they only because the majority has told them NO. Emphatically."

I'm sure you can understand that all of this with the RFRA is absolutely horrifying to Hoosiers - not just some, but a vast majority.  Our state is the laughingstock of the nation.  Our economy is going to crumble if we continue along this path.  I love this state so much, and I want to be involved in politics later in my life. This has been my goal since I've been 6 years old.  For the first time in my life, I am thinking maybe that is not a good idea, that maybe my attention would be better spent on another goal in another place.  If you knew me, this would upset you, because I've been a Leslie Knope-esque Hoosier idealist for my entire life.  I take offense to your words because it is so deeply personal to me.  I have friends who are seriously considering leaving the state.  I want to stay and fight, but perhaps that isn't a great idea. For the first time in my life, I can't say that Indiana is an awesome, underrated place because I am so embarrassed by our local government.  I've literally been ill for the past week because of this insanity.  If the state's citizens have done one thing wrong, it is our voting habits - both by electing Pence, and by not voting in high percentages.  But even the people who voted for Pence for governor thought they were getting Mitch Daniels 2.0 - a relatively quiet moderate not inclined to engage on social issues.  But I knew better, because Pence was my congressman for many years.    I voted in 2014.  I vote in every election.  I did not vote for Pence because I know who he is, and I do not like him.  Pence has so little respect for me and my family because we don't look like him and his family.  He has never been able to answer the question why he doesn't respect gay families.     Again, I think we're on the same page here, but I'd encourage you to communicate your thoughts with a change in style.  Cheers."

It's your tone that is bringing on the downvotes.   Most people in Indiana have no idea who their state representative is, yet they love talking about federal politics like it's a sport. Politicians at the Statehouse, who are your neighbors, are making more decisions that affect your life on a daily basis much more than the president or our crummy Congress.   There are 71 Republican reps in the House and 29 dems. It's even more top heavy in the Senate. I don't care what side you're on, a party having so much control that they don't even need the other side to show up in order to have a quorum for business is ludicrous and that's why we're in this mess.

I'm all for private businesses and people pursuing their own beliefs, but I'm also totally okay with them being punished by the market when those beliefs are immoral.  To pretend that the only reason they didn't want to serve at a gay wedding was because it was a ""private wedding ceremony"" is dishonest. They would serve a heterosexual wedding."

This issue seems more and more anti-christian than anything.  I'm not a religious person myself, but I damn sure will defend a person's right to be religious.

Why on earth to do we need a public accord saying two people love one another?  That isn't our business.  Emotions only affect the common good indirectly.  In the case of romance, it does so through sex.  Sex is intrinsically related to the production of children and very important to their formation.  Obviously children are critical to society.    Love is a sign of health within a marriage, but it comes and goes.  Thinking love is the foundation of marriage is a recipe for disaster given the fickle nature of human affection.  Further, such a view doesn't inform the rights and responsibilities of marriage.  It's likely the view of marriage you put forward is directly responsible for the high divorce rate and the decline of marriage.    Did you seriously think an emotion is a foundation for law?"

And no Jesus did not do away with any of the old testament doctrine.  However beating your children is moral, rape is moral, slavery is moral, raping your slave is also moral.  Try to read the bible once in awhile."
Indiana,310oue,peart,8,Wed Apr 1 13:32:07 2015 UTC,"Like most people on earth, believe them to be immoral.   Actually, you're incorrect there, so I'm not sure where you got your statistic for that statement. The view on homosexuality varies from country to country - with religion being a large factor in the overall un-accepting view. There is not a giant overwhelming un-accepting stance on homosexuality, shown by the PewGlobal study of 2013. Also, the fact that the acceptance of homosexuality has been on the rise, especially in the past 2 years, would only increase the results of these statistics.   Countries with more strict centralized religions (Ex: China/Russia, The Middle East, Africa, and some Asia/Pacific countries such as Pakistan or Indonesia, etc.) show the lower statistics on acceptance, while countries where religion is less centralized and/or less likely to be forced upon citizens (Ex: The United States, Canada, Europe - with Poland in the middle ground, Australia, The Philippines, Japan, Latin America, etc.) show a more accepting view of homosexuality.   We can see that the countries that allow freedom within government, varied views with religion, and lifestyles in general are more accepting of homosexuals. On the other hand, the countries that have a lower acceptance rate are generally countries that have strict centralized religions, less freedom within government, less freedom with different lifestyles in general, and does not allow for more open-minded views to be present overall. Education is a big key in the knowledge gained about topics such as sex/gender, sexuality, brain and behavior, and psychology as a whole. The more accepting countries have education systems that can properly teach people about humans and relationships - including all of the topics I just listed above.  Age also has a defining factor in the statistic of acceptance for homosexuals. There is a positive correlation between individuals who are in the younger age groups (18-29) and (30-49) in comparison to the older individuals within the study (50+). This shows us that the younger generations are more accepting of people and their differences overall with a progressive mindset and progressive core values.   You can find a direct link to the study here: http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2013/06/Pew-Global-Attitudes-Homosexuality-Report-FINAL-JUNE-4-2013.pdf   They aren't refusing to serve them because they involve gay people.    Yes they are. The weddings in which they are denying service to are LGBT weddings - they involve gay people. Period.    If they refused to sell pizza to gay people ever, then it would be discriminatory.   It is still discriminatory when they deny service to a LGBT wedding, because they are denying to sell their product to a certain group of people based on sexual orientation. Regardless of the fact if they would serve to gay customers on a daily basis, the fact that they deny service to LGBT weddings is enough to show their discriminatory ways. Wedding or not, denying service to anyone due to sexual preference, race, gender, age, etc. is discrimination."

Indiana,30zrm4,mbarnar,4,Wed Apr 1 02:38:23 2015 UTC,"It's implementation will not protect religious entities.  The training and such that goes into it will be for Christianity only.   This institutionalized conjoining of govt and religion is exactly what Jesus was against.  It's why he flipped the tables.  It's why he said to leave it to Caesar.  He died on the cross because of it.  Those folks had to protect their religion, you know.  He had a ""differing opinion"" about religion that went against the will of the state -but mostly it went against the Religious Right.  No the implementation of this law will only benefit the same types of people that Jesus fought -the religious business conservatives (the Sanhedrin) who call on Pilate (the State) to do their bidding.  He wasn't being conservative with his viewpoints.  He never was.  To the Pences and ""Popes"" of his day he was a heretic.  That's what Jesus preached.  That if you want to be Christ-like you should question, and blaspheme even if it gets you killed.  Hell you should walk into your Church and start tearing shit up.   Because at the end of it is God.  You won't know the answers.  Even with your dying breath you might question Him.    But the second you think you've got it.  The second you stop questioning.  The moment you say, ""We know the answers.  Let's conserve what we think we know with our narrow little flawed minds, because we know the truth.""  Then you corner yourself into flawed ideas about religion.  You open yourself up to having Christ's words twisted by the Roman's that killed him.  You have strict hierarchy put into place which distances the poor from God through systematically neatly flipping the Tables back over and setting up new doves to sell.  You have businesses saying that they need the legion to protect their flawed concept of what Jesus wanted.    If Jesus came back today they wouldn't say that he hung with prostitutes and thieves.  They'd say that he hung with the social conservatives and business conservatives.  They'd say he talked with the people that didn't take the book of Matthew to heart.  ...Also:    All things considered.     ""I'm surprisingly accommodating to black people.  All things considered.  How insulting."

But when he talks about how a CEO that commits such a serious misstep as to breach his fiduciary responsibilities to the company that it becomes necessary to remove them from their position, it seemed much more reasonable to me because he's right.  The parallel between CEO of a corporation and the governor of a state is direct and apt. And Pence, either through action or inaction, has breached his fiduciary responsibilities to the State of Indiana.  EDIT: I just finished watching Pence's press conference from this morning.

Indiana,30xyl1,peace_train8410,30,Tue Mar 31 19:02:01 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the anti-discrimination side tried to add such a provision during the voting process, and the legislature voted that amendment down 40-10.

Indiana,30xyl1,BlueCamel420,11,Wed Apr 1 00:54:51 2015 UTC,"Except they don't have just as many rights as everyone else. I'm not sure if you've been living under a rock, but that is the point of this whole ""gay marriage"" thing, because couples that are in marriages recognized by their state have another set of rights that are unavailable to gay people wanting to get married.   Here is when people usually say, thinking they are so clever: ""They CAN get married, just not to the same sex HARHAHRARH."" Sure this is true, but I hope they then find an argument other than ""sanctity of marriage"" because perhaps nothing makes the sacrament of marriage less holy than one partner entering in it for benefits.  Here are some protections that are denied to same-sex couples who can't get married in their states:   Death: If a couple is not married and one partner dies, the other partner is not entitled to bereavement leave from work, to file wrongful death claims, to draw the Social Security of the deceased partner, or to automatically inherit a shared home, assets, or personal items in the absence of a will.  Debts: Unmarried partners do not generally have responsibility for each other's debt. Divorce: Unmarried couples do not have access to the courts, structure, or guidelines in times of break-up, including rules for how to handle shared property, child support, and alimony, or protecting the weaker party and kids.  Family leave: Unmarried couples are often not covered by laws and policies that permit people to take medical leave to care for a sick spouse or for the kids.  Health: Unlike spouses, unmarried partners are usually not considered next of kin for the purposes of hospital visitation and emergency medical decisions. In addition, they can't cover their families on their health plans without paying taxes on the coverage, nor are they eligible for Medicare and Medicaid coverage.  Housing: Denied marriage, couples of lesser means are not recognized and thus can be denied or disfavored in their applications for public housing.  Immigration: U.S. residency and family unification are not available to an unmarried partner from another country.  Inheritance: Unmarried surviving partners do not automatically inherit property should their loved one die without a will, nor do they get legal protection for inheritance rights such as elective share or bypassing the hassles and expenses of probate court.  Insurance: Unmarried partners can't always sign up for joint home and auto insurance. In addition, many employers don't cover domestic partners or their biological or non-biological children in their health insurance plans.  Portability: Unlike marriages, which are honored in all states and countries, domestic partnerships and other alternative mechanisms only exist in a few states and countries, are not given any legal acknowledgment in most, and leave families without the clarity and security of knowing what their legal status and rights will be.  Parenting: Unmarried couples are denied the automatic right to joint parenting, joint adoption, joint foster care, and visitation for non-biological parents. In addition, the children of unmarried couples are denied the guarantee of child support and an automatic legal relationship to both parents, and are sometimes sent a wrongheaded but real negative message about their own status and family.  Privilege: Unmarried couples are not protected against having to testify against each other in judicial proceedings, and are also usually denied the coverage in crime victims counseling and protection programs afforded married couples.  Property: Unmarried couples are excluded from special rules that permit married couples to buy and own property together under favorable terms, rules that protect married couples in their shared homes and rules regarding the distribution of the property in the event of death or divorce.  Retirement: In addition to being denied access to shared or spousal benefits through Social Security as well as coverage under Medicare and other programs, unmarried couples are denied withdrawal rights and protective tax treatment given to spouses with regard to IRA's and other retirement plans.  Taxes: Unmarried couples cannot file joint tax returns and are excluded from tax benefits and claims specific to marriage. In addition, they are denied the right to transfer property to one another and pool the family's resources without adverse tax consequences."

Indiana,30yv2s,Clavis_Apocalypticae,5,Wed Apr 1 02:15:13 2015 UTC,"Some coroners have very interesting ideas about what ""found"" means...  False Certainty - Why did the pathologist in the Purvi Patel feticide case use the discredited “lung float test” to show her fetus was born alive?   There’s another reason Patel’s case deserves scrutiny. It has to do with how the prosecution went about establishing the fetus’s condition upon birth. At the center of its presentation was a method that involved removing the fetus’s lungs and placing them in a container of liquid in order to see if they would float. The theory behind the method, which was developed during the 17th century but has been questioned by modern medical experts, holds that if a lung does float, it means the baby drew at least one breath of air before expiring, and that if it sinks, the fetus was already dead by the time it left the womb.  The procedure, known as the “lung float test” or the “the hydrostatic test,” was carried out in this case by forensic pathologist Joseph Prahlow, a past president of the National Association of Medical Examiners. Prahlow, who declined to comment for this article, testified in court that the lung of the Patel fetus did indeed float, suggesting it was born alive and that its mother could have taken steps to keep it that way. Prahlow supplemented the evidence from the float test with other findings, testifying that the lungs looked full of air when he removed the fetus’s chest plate during the autopsy, that the air sacs in the lung tissue looked expanded when he looked at them under a microscope, and that the weight of the lungs—approximately 21 grams—was consistent with a live birth. Prahlow also testified that, according to his analysis, blood had started flowing to the lungs, which would have only happened after the baby had taken a breath.  “It’s an absolutely discredited test,” said Gregory Davis, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Kentucky. “It boggles my mind that in the 21st century … this test is still being relied upon to determine whether a baby is born alive or dead.”  Davis is not the only forensic pathologist who believes the float test is unreliable. The most recent edition of Knight’s Forensic Pathology, a widely used textbook, says “there are too many recorded instances when control tests have shown that stillborn lungs may float and the lungs from undoubtedly live-born infants have sunk, to allow it to be used in testimony in a criminal trial.” The authors of another textbook, Essentials of Forensic Medicine, called the test “pointless” in 1984.   http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/30yu7e/indianapolis_first_woman_in_us_sentenced_for/cpx4awq"

I'm not sure what 92 counties Pence was talking about but in the '98-'00s my little town managed to run a family out of town (at least out of school) because they had an adopted black son.  I've noticed a large political shift among my old friends as well. Those that stayed in the county seem to be against this. Anyone that got out and traveled (even if it was just to a 'big city' like Lafayette or South Bend) usually ended up more 'liberal' and don't care about the war on drugs or gays. Those that stayed in town just keep sharing Fox News articles.   people will continue to find a reason to keep that going.   Depends if some southern state decides to double down and go forward with their own, more anti-LGBTQ bill. Everyone will forget about Indiana.

A particular group of elected officials (who were not elected on the premise that they would draft a bill like this) decided that they'd pass an overly vague law that could enable potential abuse.  Misguided as their actions were and as much as they should rectify the mistake, it does not make sense to punish an entire population for the actions of a few.  To be completely honest, the words being thrown at the residents of Indiana are far worse than I've ever heard directed towards LGBT people here.

But pissing off Marc Benioff, when he has an investment in something you control, is just a recipe for social media disaster.  He has a lot of clout in the tech industry, and it's no surprise to me that he could influence so many tech leaders to step up with him.  Gen Con was the other real catalyst, in that they also provide a major investment in Indy. Their disagreement meant a very tangible number that people could rally behind. Worse, still, it pissed off the geek crowd. What happens when you anger the smart and inventive people? They fight back, and roll for criticals.

Mitch kept the religious wing of the Indiana GOP in line, which made the Republicans very appealing to most in Indiana.

Indiana,30vrmr,occamstaser,9,Tue Mar 31 14:19:19 2015 UTC,"My issue with it is that it extends additional protections to people with religious faith. I don't have a religious faith, however I do have moral convictions but I am not covered by this law. This makes me a secondary citizen. If have a dispute and don't want to perform a service for something I am morally opposed to, I am not covered.  All of this is, of course, secondary to LGBT concerns, but if they were protected then this is the problem I see. Religious people should have no more rights or freedoms then a non-religious person and laws like this change that."

My fear is that we are creating ways to marginalize groups in the future.  We protect LGBT today, but then we have to wait on bureaucracy to catch up when the next group of people is marginalized.  Creating extra steps in the government creates bigger government down the road.

Indiana,30xeob,Anadyne,10,Tue Mar 31 14:16:48 2015 UTC,"They are very specific with their words. It's not a ""license to discriminate"" because you have to go to court and prove that you are burdened. Does it enable discrimination? Yes.   The law exists to give businesses first amendment religious protections, and specify a test for determining whether rights were violated.   Also, since the issue at hand, at least in the media, is discrimination based on religious beliefs, couldn't the State Government just simply add an addendum that would make it illegal for any businesses openly doing business with the general public to discriminate, and any businesses that have reservations about doing business with the general public retain a sort of ""private club"" status that only caters to select individuals?   Absolutely, they tried to amend the law to prevent discrimination, but those amendments were rejected. The problem is that religion is a ""protected class"" in the law, and sexual orientation is not. Unless you protect sexual orientation, it won't be considered ""discrimination"" under the law."
Indiana,30xeob,NaturalSelectorX,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:41:34 2015 UTC,Could you give an example of how it enables discrimination?
Indiana,30xeob,Corew1n,6,Tue Mar 31 17:36:06 2015 UTC,"Sure. First, a little background:  Section 7 of the law includes businesses in the definition of a ""person"".  That means a business open to the public can have religious beliefs.   Section 8 of the law starts like this: ""Except as provided in subsection (b), a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion,even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.""  What is a rule of general applicability? Local anti-discrimination laws. Many cities and counties in Indiana have local ordinances that prevent discrimination against homosexuals. This law lets you defend against violating those with your religious belief.   Go to a religious bakery and try to get a cake for a gay wedding Bakery says ""we don't make cakes for gay weddings, our religion prohibits that"" Court declares that they are substantially burdened, and overrules local ordinance."
Indiana,30xeob,NaturalSelectorX,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:48:35 2015 UTC,"Yet if it was a regular cake, for say a birthday, which happens to be for a gay guy, they wouldn't have legal grounds to deny service?  I guess I'm questioning whether discrimination is a viable term when it only applies to one particular event, but not any other."
Indiana,30xeob,Corew1n,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:45:57 2015 UTC,"They may still have legal ground, but it might be harder to explain how gay birthdays are a religious burden. It gets muddy because a bakery offers many products. If we think about Christian adoption agencies, they would be able to refuse adopting children to gay couples. A daycare could refuse to accept children with gay parents."
Indiana,30xeob,NaturalSelectorX,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:53:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, the adoption one probably possible, but I don't think a court would rule in favor of a daycare doing something like that.

Indiana,30xeob,Hurrah_for_Karamazov,2,Tue Mar 31 19:15:35 2015 UTC,"What's different is that the caterer (or whomever) is choosing not to participate in a particular activity. He or she is not choosing to discriminate against a person. As I wrote elsewhere: The issue is whether the person is refusing to participate in an act as compared to treating the person unjustly based on what they are. Not serving a gay person just because he's gay? Not alright. Not participating by serving someone in his gay marriage (regardless of his actual orientation)? Completely reasonable. In the same way you may refuse to cater a protestant anti-gay rally, but would otherwise serve any of those same protestants in any other context.   Even if I were to accept this incredibly strained argument that not servicing a gay couple's wedding because you believe their union is sinful isn't actually discrimination based on who they are, it still looks like you're discriminating against them, the people requesting the service. ""I refuse to participate in your wedding because it's gay"" and ""I refuse to participate in your wedding because you're gay"" both cash out as discrimination against a person by denying them service."
Indiana,30xeob,thor_moleculez,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:03:28 2015 UTC,"No, because the discrimination doesn't look to the person at all. People are protected, not activities.

It's the rally that upsets you and causes you not to serve, not who or what he is.  People have a lot of trouble distinguishing between ""being gay"" and ""having a gay wedding."" It's philosophically and legally sloppy."
Indiana,30xeob,Hurrah_for_Karamazov,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:31:16 2015 UTC,"People have a lot of trouble distinguishing between ""being gay"" and ""having a gay wedding.""   I understand the distinction, even though I don't think it's a meaningful one. But even if I accept this very strained distinction, the conclusion that you're discriminating against an event is not entailed.  The event didn't walk into your anti-gay flower shop and ask for flowers; a person did. You denied the person's request because the event the flowers were meant for was a gay wedding. You're discriminating against a person by refusing them service, on the basis that the requested service necessitates participating some event you believe is sinful."
Indiana,30xeob,thor_moleculez,2,Wed Apr 1 13:47:12 2015 UTC,"You're refusing to help a person with a particular activity. That is not discrimination against him, as any person (him or any other him) could walk into your store and you would likewise deny the request.

You say, ""no, sorry, I don't do gay weddings."" The same Asian walks into your store and requests you photograph his heterosexual wedding. You say yes. What has changed? Only the event.  What would normal discrimination look like? An Asian walks into your store and requests you photograph his gay wedding. You say ""no."" The same Asian walks into your store and requests you photograph his heterosexual wedding. You say ""No, I don't serve Asians."" In this case, he, what he is, is the motivation of the discrimination. The event is irrelevant, as the discrimination runs to the person, not the event.  It's not just a semantic distinction. It's a fundamental distinction concerning the motivation of the person refusing and the meaning of his refusing. Beyond just the legal difference, there's a moral difference as well.

Here is the text of the Act:   (a) In general Government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section.  (b) Exception Government may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person—   (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and   (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.  (c) Judicial relief A person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government. Standing to assert a claim or defense under this section shall be governed by the general rules of standing under article III of the Constitution.   Here is the Text of Indiana's ""Anti-Gay Law""   Sec. 8. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.  (b) A governmental entity may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if the governmental entity demonstrates that application of the burden to the person:  (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and  (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.   Sec. 9. A person whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened, by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding. If the relevant governmental entity is not a party to the proceeding, the governmental entity has an unconditional right to intervene in order to respond to the person's invocation of this chapter.

Is it simply that the ones there that supported the law had a D in the chyron after their name?  By the way, appeal to emotion and ad hominem - you didn't fare well in debate class did you?"
Indiana,30us4z,bonked_or_maybe_not,-2,Tue Mar 31 17:55:15 2015 UTC,read the post below mine dumb ass. protected class. ARE THE LGBT A PROTECTED CLASS????

Indiana,30us4z,p1ratemafia,7,Tue Mar 31 15:03:40 2015 UTC,But sexual orientation NEEDS to be added to the states civil rights laws. Otherwise it may not be the intent of the law but i can see it still ending bad with peoples hands tied.

Indiana,30xoua,thabe331,22,Tue Mar 31 17:55:35 2015 UTC,He's full of shit.  This law is about discrimination.  Plain and simple.

Indiana,30xoua,DonnieNarco,23,Tue Mar 31 15:46:20 2015 UTC,Why was this law needed? When were the rights of the religious being trampled on?  It's not a coincidence that this law was pushed right after gay marriage was legalized in Indiana.  There's a reason why he won't make LGBT a protected group in Indiana.

Indiana,30xoua,MC_Carty,-10,Tue Mar 31 21:18:18 2015 UTC,INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana Gov. Mike Pence says he wants legislation clarifying that a new religious-freedom does not allow discrimination on his desk by the end of the week.
Indiana,30xoua,calisto77,18,Tue Mar 31 15:35:03 2015 UTC,"If the law was never about discrimination, as Mike Pence claims, then why ask for legislation by the end of the week for ""clarification""?   Sounds like ""cover-your-ass"" bullshit to me."
Indiana,30xoua,cavernph,4,Tue Mar 31 15:55:14 2015 UTC,He probably wants clarification himself so that he can then regurgitate that information when asked the same questions.
Indiana,30xoua,litper,2,Tue Mar 31 16:45:19 2015 UTC,DAMAGE CONTROL!!!!!!HE KNOWS HE IS IN A FUCK TON OF TROUBLE POLITICALLY. PUT A FORK IN HIM.
Indiana,30xoua,CharlieMopps1,-19,Tue Mar 31 21:19:51 2015 UTC,"Eh, sounds more like repairing the damage done by the media.  The law could use more clarification, and most level-headed, rational people here cite the ""loose language"" as a problem.  If that is resolved, it could help."
Indiana,30xoua,NaturalSelectorX,14,Tue Mar 31 15:56:26 2015 UTC,What about their explicit unwillingness to define sexuality as a protected class? That would have prevented all of this but they out and out refused to do so. Seems pretty obvious to anyone paying attention what the intent of the bill was. The media is not to blame here.
Indiana,30xoua,VarsityPhysicist,-13,Tue Mar 31 16:03:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say that's a separate social issue that will likely need to be handled by a different Governor.   The Matthew Shepard Act already protects orientation as a protected class, I believe?  Though that may be specific to hate crimes"

Indiana,30ulyq,HKBFG,3,Tue Mar 31 03:54:49 2015 UTC,"You're right. But my smarmy correlation leaned more toward the religious hypocrisy mindset, as it's not uncommon to read about preachers/ministers who denounce homosexuality--and some of those are the vocal, active ones--are actually, behind closed doors, partaking in it (Ted Haggard comes to mind)."
Indiana,30vglo,chemistry35,6,Tue Mar 31 00:57:33 2015 UTC,Good for them. I was hoping to see something with more teeth from Gencon after their first letter.
Indiana,30vglo,alephenon,3,Tue Mar 31 03:47:47 2015 UTC,What would you expect them to do? Cancelling this year would piss off all the attendees who have already paid hotels and flights etc. They have a contract to go until 2020.
Indiana,30vglo,jaymz668,3,Tue Mar 31 04:06:56 2015 UTC,"I doubt anyone has set-in-stone plans for next year, however. Depending on how it goes this year (and it may be perfectly fine, since Indianapolis is more left-leaning than the rest of the state), they may decide to break the contract after this year's convention."

Truthfully - in a ""right to work"" environment that Pence favors, an employee isn't at will (see what I did there?) to demand answers from an employer, just as a constituent isn't at will to demand answers from Governor Pence.    Let's make the question as simple as possible and quote George S's interview with ""Yes or no should it be legal to discriminate against gays and lesbians?""   Anything other than ""No"" is less than the people of Indiana deserve."
Indiana,30w0gp,jbrogdon,2,Tue Mar 31 04:41:05 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, they are going back to ""clarify"" the law and clean up their mess. Why they rejected these ""clarifying"" amendments in the first place is still a good question."
