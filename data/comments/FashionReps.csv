FashionReps,3e4qs5,blurzyo,2,Wed Jul 22 00:54:34 2015 UTC,They are a nice color. You can't really buy Chelsa boots for the price you got it for. You should get a pair again. But how is quality of the denim? Soft?
FashionReps,3e4qs5,repaccount,2,Wed Jul 22 01:15:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input, setting it up with HP Dragon now.  The black denim is like a rough denim texture (Similar to a raw denim texture if you've felt them), and the blue one is softer, like regular jeans.

FashionReps,3e1yeu,HiHoBigBootyHoes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:38:58 2015 UTC,perhaps it's clothing made at the same sweatshop factory as legitimate apparel but sold to unauthorized resellers as opposed to shipped commercially
FashionReps,3e1yeu,Frankie_F,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:28:31 2015 UTC,"The term ""Unauthorized authentic"" is pretty far-fetched, just think of it as a higher grade replica."
FashionReps,3e2f3m,OchoChino,3,Tue Jul 21 13:00:18 2015 UTC,I am also annoyed as I have a bit of credit left because for the fifth time in a row I ordered but one of the two things I ordered was out of stock(at least I was finally able to order one thing!). I believe around 6pm(I'm in CA) they will fix their servers as that's when customer service gets on.

FashionReps,3e1lrc,Holmework,3,Tue Jul 21 08:02:23 2015 UTC,If you're buying a CDG hoodie you might have more to worry about than just the floating E. Since that logo is mirrored it leads to other issues. The letter may look jumbly or not straight. Various letters might be higher or lower than others. Look closely at the pics.

If you're really wanting to get some authentic designer cop from the store. A gucci belt will run you 160 to 225 at Neiman Marcus or like 225 to 325 from the gucci store. A lot of the times Gucci will have an online sale and belts will be like 150."

(As in, when its midday, is that dial pointed to 12? do the smaller dials move when you start the timer? Reps of mk watches usually won't bother with making the smaller dials move because they're only fashion watches. The C in Michael defs isn't right, but it could just be a faulty one. If the smaller dials definitely don't move at all, then its fake for sure. If they do, you probably just got a faulty watch"

FashionReps,3dr24h,LinkinMode,3,Sun Jul 19 05:51:44 2015 UTC,"The hoodies are absolutely terrible the caravaggio print is way too big, if you compare it to authentic pictures. If you don't want your friedns calling you out, I'd buy from this link: http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.5-c.w4002-11016810964.34.sCY8Pb&id=43810873795 it is really good for its price, and the store has other on-point products, the only flaw I could find was that the screen printing was little less glossy than the authentic, maybe its the lighting in the qc pics. The collar is good. If you're trying to spend more, the tees from http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=2013.1.1998246701.3.0IwmIR&scm=1007.10152.7196.0i520017590213&id=520208961509&pvid=b73fc57d-1fe9-4e02-9c0c-c224d1fe6fdb is the best possible one. It is around 90 USD for a rep, but worth it imo, from the pics, it looks like it could fool even Virgil. They almost look too good, but I you'd get bait and switched as the store has a crown rating. Things to look for in an authentic one are the seam on the back, if the tee is white, the print on the back should be glossy, and the collar should have a thicker cloth, you'll know what I mean when you look at authentic pics. Good luck on your purchase!  EDIT: The screen printing on the first link is A LOT less glossy than the authentic on white tees, get a black tee its not noticeable on them."

FashionReps,3drw1a,s_adi,2,Sun Jul 19 06:23:52 2015 UTC,"Versace VE2120s are good. They're all over Ali, only one quality level AFAIK but the ""green/gold"" ones are the best colorway because they don't cover the arms in cheap-looking paint. The only problem is that the screws tend to loosen up pretty easily, but that's an easy fix (just keep a glasses screwdriver around the house). They're like $7, so I bought three pairs, because them being all lens across the front makes them easy to break if you drop them. But they look accurate and actually protect your eyes unlike most sunglasses reps."

I do not know your job occupation, your age, your personal interests, or the style you hope to achieve. I suggest checking out  /r/malefashionadvice before you invest your paychecks into your clothing.   IMO, this subreddit is broken down to two groups... streetwear and designer wear.  Street wear being SUPREME, BAPE, Nike, Jordans, Yeezy Boosts (some might argue the later),  Raybans, Stussy, Obey, Hood by Air, etc...  Designer wear being GVC, LV, Hermes, Ferragamo, Balmain, SLP, Cartier, etc.  Just keep in mind this subreddit has all ages of individuals with a heavy bell curve leaning towards teenagers and late 20 year olds so you'll always receive conflicting advice here."

FashionReps,3doiab,haloyo,3,Sat Jul 18 11:43:03 2015 UTC,"Off white flannels almost always have the wrong print. The ones that have the right print are around 500 rmb and are too short. If you want I could link you some of the right print ones.  These are 2 with the right print but too short that i found with a super quick search of ""off white flannel""  1 2"
FashionReps,3doiab,taboorGG,2,Sun Jul 19 17:56:47 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, thanks for taking the time to find these. Don't know much about off white, but I guess these seems pretty good. You say the only problem is, that they are too short. So why don't you just size up?"
FashionReps,3doiab,haloyo,3,Sun Jul 19 22:20:53 2015 UTC,"its true that you can size up, but as /u/basedm1k3y said, the flannel pattern itself is too short. I think as long as you size up, nobody is really gonna notice that the pattern of your flannel is off"

FashionReps,3doiab,taboorGG,2,Sun Jul 19 22:50:54 2015 UTC,Only xs and xxs. Is it just wierd sizing or do you have to be like 160cm tall to wear these?
FashionReps,3doiab,BasedM1K3Y,2,Mon Jul 20 00:43:06 2015 UTC,"The fit of the authentic is oversize, so xs would be like an m, this is good as it fits like the authentic. Check the site measurements to see how it will fit on you."
FashionReps,3doiab,taboorGG,3,Mon Jul 20 00:49:05 2015 UTC,"Alright, so you feel like these flannels are really good? Just don't want to be called out, but I have really no idea about off-white, so can't really tell what is good and what is not."
FashionReps,3doiab,BasedM1K3Y,2,Mon Jul 20 00:53:08 2015 UTC,"Depends on the people around you, on the street I don't think anyone is going to stop you and inspect your flannel, but if your friends are hypebeasts like mine, if you do get called out, say your product is an xs. If you google the flannel or look at retailers like revolve, the flannels pictured are size medium, so the print obviously will run longer, you can explain this. I'm honestly considering buying this.  EDIT: The second website's xs is 80 cm in length, so buy one that fits big on you, compared to your regular tees.   EDIT 2: The print on the second site looks wrinkled lol I hope the ones they send are good. The only reason I'm considering the second site over the first is the crown rating on the 2nd site."
FashionReps,3doiab,taboorGG,2,Mon Jul 20 01:04:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, also saw the wrinkeling. I really doubt it's gonna look like that if you buy it, just wierd they would use that flannnel for their pictures.. Anyways, tell me which one you're gonna end up buying!"
FashionReps,3doiab,BasedM1K3Y,2,Mon Jul 20 10:41:23 2015 UTC,"I mean the first link has better pictures, but the second link has a higher store rating. I'm still not sure, they both have tagged pics too. I'll probably order from the 1st link ( http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.64.AdPIh9&id=44256015064&ns=1&abbucket=8#detail ) because the second one only has up to size xs and I'm 6'1 so I'd need a bigger size. The 1st link goes up to a size medium, I'll probably get a size small. Good luck on your purchase!"
FashionReps,3doiab,taboorGG,2,Mon Jul 20 17:18:17 2015 UTC,"Hey btw, as you seem like you know a lot about this stuff. How good are Pyrex reps? As in the flannels and hoodies? Searched around in the sidebar, and seems like there is a lot of mixed opinions about this."
FashionReps,3doiab,BasedM1K3Y,2,Mon Jul 20 17:14:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not looking to buy the pyrex shorts so I wouldn't know about those, the hoodies are bad because the caravaggio print on the front touches the pockets or almost touch, which the authentics do not. If you look at retail pictures, just google ""off white hoodie"" you'll see what I'm talking about. Barneys has good pictures. The flannels like we talked about are mostly bad, but the links above have the right print so you'd be good ordering from either http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.64.AdPIh9&id=44256015064&ns=1&abbucket=8#detail or from http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.24.AdPIh9&id=44285234299&ns=1&abbucket=8#detail as these two stores that got the print right. The fit is oversize, so look at the measurements they provide for you. Size xs would have a length of ~82 cm."
FashionReps,3doiab,BasedM1K3Y,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:33 2015 UTC,i actually have no clue about their flannels. i think theyre supposed to be oversized but i have no clue if reps come oversized already. ill hit u up in a second about that once i look thru some more reviews.

FashionReps,3doiab,BasedM1K3Y,5,Sat Jul 18 02:09:25 2015 UTC,"Man. Judging from the pictures and reviews of the hoodies I see compared to the auths i've seen IRL, they're almost flawless.  The printing on the offwhite (auth) hoodies look kinda cheap and the fabric is whatever, so from my point they're pretty dang on point."
FashionReps,3doiab,Delvonte,2,Sat Jul 18 03:10:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply fam. Right it should be pretty easy for them to replicate since the whole back of it has white stripes and it says white. The only thing that would be a challenge would be the picture/art on the front.
FashionReps,3doiab,AngelWoosh,2,Sat Jul 18 23:05:21 2015 UTC,"actually the hoodie reps are pretty bad, the print touches the pockets and even the ""good"" ones, even though their prints don't touch the pocket, they still have a print that is too big."
FashionReps,3doiab,Delvonte,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:46:59 2015 UTC,youre right. i wouldn't worry about a rep. even the shittiest quality hoodies are real good.
FashionReps,3doiab,BasedM1K3Y,2,Sat Jul 18 04:53:24 2015 UTC,"same goes with the shirts too, touched/saw a few authentics and i had to think for a second... are these reps? nah they can't be.... looked at them several times, front and back. the shirts are just simple screenprints on normal ass tees, i don't see the difference between an auth and rep unless the shirt is abnormally shitty quality and the print is off"
FashionReps,3doiab,Delvonte,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:09:51 2015 UTC,"most off white tees are on when it comes to the print but the best way to tell if theyre fake is the back seam. a lot of high end designers add a seam throughout the back of their tees to make a much more fitted fit. and then not all off white tees have that, but the majority do. thats the way i can tell asap."
FashionReps,3doiab,BasedM1K3Y,2,Sat Jul 18 06:21:10 2015 UTC,Do any of the reps have the fitted fit designer thing?
FashionReps,3doiab,AngelWoosh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:00:28 2015 UTC,"theres one seller who seems to have that thing. its the first link, 2makergoods. if u look at his pics he provides u can clearly see it but im not sure i they actually have it cause the price is so low."
FashionReps,3doiab,Snkrheadlord,2,Sat Jul 18 18:56:26 2015 UTC,"yeah, a lot of them don't have the backseem, actually. Only a few of them do."
FashionReps,3doiab,Snkrheadlord,2,Sat Jul 18 10:09:23 2015 UTC,"The hoodies aren't supposed to have a seam lol, only the tees. All tees have the seam on the authentics, no exception."
FashionReps,3doiab,Snkrheadlord,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"That much is obvious. And no, not all tees have the seams on  them.  You even seen an auth in person? Get outta here with your no knowledge having ass."
FashionReps,3doiab,Evotee,2,Mon Jul 20 00:13:34 2015 UTC,"LMFAO, plz link me any off white tee, without a seam, from any retailer. And yes, I see off white tees quite a lot, I live on Madison Ave lol  Edit: If you did see one in person, it is hard to see the seam it isn't really visible unless you are up close, so that might be why you think they don't all have a seam, if you go to Barneys and look at their off white inventory, I can assure you all their tees have seams"
FashionReps,3doiab,OGMR,3,Mon Jul 20 00:52:41 2015 UTC,Just watch out because some of them have a plain black dangly pully hood thing that I can't think of the name of instead of the black and white one
FashionReps,3doiab,OGMR,2,Sat Jul 18 07:21:51 2015 UTC,"Oh the drawstring? Damn, so do you think it's like a hit or miss with buying the fake version?"
FashionReps,3doiab,BasedM1K3Y,2,Sat Jul 18 23:03:42 2015 UTC,hoodies or tees? most hoodies are a hit but finding good tees are difficult. unhs has good ones but not many designs and kinda pricy. 2makergoods on taobao got the best tees and hoodies and lowest prices.
FashionReps,3doiab,BasedM1K3Y,2,Sun Jul 19 02:52:09 2015 UTC,Yea a lot of people are telling me taobao has better items for better prices. So I guess that's a win-win? I saw the NY supreme box logo for around ¥55 which converts to $0.44. Lmfao is it legit? Thanks for replying too fam

FashionReps,3dkt0t,SS1999,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:17:16 2015 UTC,Is the exportclothes one any good in terms of quality?
FashionReps,3dkt0t,rep_out,2,Fri Jul 17 22:28:43 2015 UTC,"I never ordered from there, but I have been reading a lot of postive things about them.  There is also a couple of Youtube videos reviewing HM X VERSACE from Exportclothes, go look for them.  The jacket is really 1:1 on the videos, but some comments seem to say that ""they ordered the same and got shit quality"" but it might just be competitors"
FashionReps,3dkt0t,SS1999,2,Sat Jul 18 13:56:43 2015 UTC,All the H&M Versace bomber jackets are from the same factory. They stop making them or you can say improving them a long time ago. The jacket is NOT 1:1 due to the fact that the real one has velvet sleeves while the replica uses Nylon.

FashionReps,3dk52f,wolfcult,7,Thu Jul 16 22:37:29 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the seller running away with your money. Aliexpress has got your back. If there is no tracking number posted within the listed processing time, you will automatically be refunded. Aliexpress uses Escrow system, which means the funds aren't released to the seller until you confirm the receipt of goods, or until the purchase protection expires.      Some shady sellers would post a fake tracking number, and if that happens to you, you can start a dispute and Aliexpress will refund you the money. Sometimes, on cheap items it is too expensive for the seller to ship with a tracking number (usually on sub-$10 items) the seller would post a link to the page which shows when the item ships. Don't worry about it too much, I've been buying stuff off AliExpress for probably 2 years now, and to this date have not been scammed. There have been small issues, but they have always been resolved fairly by the AliExpress dispute team."

FashionReps,3dfrq3,aminoacid91,2,Wed Jul 15 22:54:41 2015 UTC,No problem! Hope I answered all of your questions :)
FashionReps,3dfrq3,billb90,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:20:43 2015 UTC,How do cards fit in the sleeve? Is it a good fit and can you fit multiple cards per sleeve? And does the wallet get super thick if you fill it with everything?
FashionReps,3dfrq3,mariuszsanitariusz,2,Thu Jul 16 06:16:33 2015 UTC,Cards fit great! It does need to somewhat be broken in by placing cards inside of it. The leather needs to stretch a bit before it is able to put cards in. I'd say that it can fit two cards per slot max. The wallet itself won't get too thick. I'd say its bigger than your normal lv wallet though. You should be able to fit a decent amount of things.

FashionReps,3dfrq3,HennessyLM,2,Thu Jul 16 08:05:11 2015 UTC,I can't link you directly to the store due to the fact the aliexpress would shut down the store.. BUT you are able to contact her by emailing her asking which item you'd like to purchase and she can help you from there.

CDG, I copped some and they are decent quality but it seems the products aren't available at the moment?  Then there's also these regular shirts who seem to be decent   Would look into:   Saint Laurent Paris (best way to get them is through UNHS there's lots of reviews on this sub as well)  Fear of God bomber  Representclo jeans  These are some of my favourite reps but we'd really have to know your style first to determine what we could recommend you."

FashionReps,3d8b8u,repcitybitch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:42:09 2015 UTC,Darn that's too bad. I'll still do a review once I get them.
FashionReps,3d8b8u,TopShelfReps,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:54:27 2015 UTC,i bought the 2140s a while back the biggest size and i noticed arm and the face dont align properly and seem like a big give away. what i mean is usually on the originals i think it makes a perfect 90 degrees without either piece sticking out but on mine the arms seem to be too far inwards. obviously not a big deal unless somebody is really close though. what are your thoughts
FashionReps,3d8b8u,TopShelfReps,2,Tue Jul 21 06:42:16 2015 UTC,I did a review on these vs my authentics.. these are honestly way off in shape. They dont have the same tilt that the authentic wayfarers do.. it throws it off. but overall build quality is pretty solid.
FashionReps,3d8b8u,repcitybitch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:25:25 2015 UTC,"yeah, but without having the two next to each other, it is almost unnoticeable"
FashionReps,3d8b8u,TopShelfReps,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:43:32 2015 UTC,"It just feels different on face, i dont know how to describe it. I mean, i got my authentic pair on eBay for $81. Worth every penny."
FashionReps,3d8b8u,repcitybitch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:00:32 2015 UTC,on the officials are the face and the arms aligned perfectly? cause the pair i got are off by like 3mm where its pretty noticeable if you are standing beside them
FashionReps,3d8b8u,TopShelfReps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:43:15 2015 UTC,"Depends which model you are comparing, hopefully not a 50mm and a 54mm"

FashionReps,3d8b8u,AnonymousKIA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:27:29 2015 UTC,Yeah i tend to stay away from 54mm raybans since they resemble the 2 dollar knockoffs too much.
FashionReps,3d8b8u,freshairr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:57:14 2015 UTC,you mean they look terrible? or more of the knockoffs are 54mm

FashionReps,3d8pxm,wutangm8,3,Tue Jul 14 12:14:13 2015 UTC,Why get reps of stuff that you can buy for less than $100 and even cheaper at an outlet store? Genuinely curious
FashionReps,3d8pxm,bored_lad,7,Tue Jul 14 13:00:52 2015 UTC,Im in Australia dude there is no outlet stores in my city. These hoodies are like $150 plus here... So i think RL stuff is held higher here because it cost more/rarer (barely any stores sell).
FashionReps,3d8pxm,vokesy123,2,Tue Jul 14 14:09:10 2015 UTC,Same for us I'm in Ireland and these are €130 and never go on sale or get discounted. If someone orders they should do a review.
FashionReps,3d8pxm,wutangm8,2,Tue Jul 14 14:36:07 2015 UTC,"Personally I buy reps because I like the designs and can't really find anything in my price range that is affordable.

FashionReps,3d8pxm,Yung_Lee,2,Tue Jul 14 13:49:11 2015 UTC,"Yea i get that but if you can get better quality shit for damn near the same price and not have to deal with China, then why get reps?"

FashionReps,3da1la,DontPushTheCush,2,Tue Jul 14 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"damn in the states if you go to marshall's you can get one for like 20$, the only reason why its less than in stores is because its older seasons/a year old, but I don't see the difference"
FashionReps,3da1la,based___god,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:15:40 2015 UTC,IN on daily thread about how cheap RL is in the US and how expensive in europe... :(
FashionReps,3da1la,Da4orce,4,Tue Jul 14 18:19:19 2015 UTC,In every thread asking for RL reps you usually have someone ask the same question you posted and someone explaining that EU/Australia have to pay 3-4 times more for the same stuff. Every.. Fking... Day..
FashionReps,3da1la,SupaHotFlame,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:22:56 2015 UTC,A basic Polo is $80 on sale here in Canada.
FashionReps,3da1la,bored_lad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:25:37 2015 UTC,As we keep saying in ever thread when people ask we're paying 4/5 times what your paying using sometimes more. There is also only one shop in my area that sells RL it has a small selection and I'm fairly sure it never gets anything new season or anything always just a few polos and button downs noting else. That shit never goes on sale here either unless its some weird size like 3xl.

FashionReps,3d80o3,based___god,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:49:08 2015 UTC,As a rule of thumb take a decimal out and add 1 to the left-most.   200 Yuan = 20 + 10 = 30ish USD  Or use google Kappa
FashionReps,3d80o3,razji,0,Tue Jul 14 23:43:16 2015 UTC,Just copy the currency with the yen symbol into www.Google.com  example: ¥245 to usd

I bet if that size 14 sells well they might make a whole lot more in a 14 so that's pretty great actually. Everyone wins in the end.

FashionReps,3d3va0,manashas97,6,Mon Jul 13 08:46:05 2015 UTC,"hoodies are great quality, and they have nice ass embroiderys so I'd just save up and order the legit one. plus it's OVO there isn't really a replica market."
FashionReps,3d3va0,NickVsYou,-1,Mon Jul 13 09:21:46 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of OVO stuff on aliexpress actually, there's certainly reps of it."
FashionReps,3d3va0,Osoconceited,3,Mon Jul 13 13:18:54 2015 UTC,"There are OVO ""reps"" on ali, but not really anythine from Drakes Legit Clothing line per say. Its only screenprinted/ Ironed on OVO owls on basic black tees"
FashionReps,3d3va0,louis_vuitton_dam,2,Mon Jul 13 17:10:20 2015 UTC,none
FashionReps,3d3yn2,nzahir,3,Mon Jul 13 09:37:54 2015 UTC,"No off-white tees are gonna be 1:1 quality, just not popular enough.  But they're a couple of replicas on Stayfashion and a ton on Taobao, just have to judge the quality for yourself."
FashionReps,3d3yn2,Tixoz,3,Mon Jul 13 09:53:07 2015 UTC,off white reps are always slightly off. On tees the major flaw is the majority don't have a seam on the back and the material is off. In real life they fit oversized and are thin and the seam easily shows. The print looks like tape and most reps just don't have the quality of the print. Taobao is you're best option but you have to shift though a lot of pages
FashionReps,3d3yn2,TheAfterEffect,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:54:40 2015 UTC,"Do you know anything about their flannels? Thinking of buying one, but cant really see the flaws myself."
FashionReps,3d3yn2,taboorGG,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:11:30 2015 UTC,"Most flannels have the wrong pattern. I've been searching aliexpress and taobao for a good rep, but almost all have the wrong pattern. The ones that have the right pattern are around $100 and are too short. I don't think the demand is there for these flannels, which really sucks. In real life the flannels seem very stiff and heavy which is also probably difficult to replicate."
FashionReps,3d3yn2,haloyo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:00:30 2015 UTC,Lots of flaws with flannels. The pattern on the flannel is usually off and real ones fit a size larger and are really long.
FashionReps,3d3yba,Fuckinglaced,5,Mon Jul 13 09:33:15 2015 UTC,w2c h&m replica... lmao
FashionReps,3d3yba,based___god,4,Mon Jul 13 13:20:42 2015 UTC,The shoe costs 40-55$ in store so no one would profit much making replicas because the market of people looking for replicas of those is little to none. Gonna just have to buy em from the store.

FashionReps,3d2ujz,seamill,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:34:51 2015 UTC,"Stitching looks sloppy on the black one? Also, hows the brim? Someone mentioned its kind of soft."
FashionReps,3d2ujz,honestasianman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:34:47 2015 UTC,how do i fix the strap one the last batch black cap?
FashionReps,3d2ujz,anassouseh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:24:39 2015 UTC,am i the only one that notices the biggest flaw in my opinion like aren't S logo caps supposed to be a bit shiny? the legit ones appear to have a bit of a glossy finish on them and these are not glossy at all
FashionReps,3d2ujz,brucybruh,0,Sat Jul 18 08:32:07 2015 UTC,could be wrong but i believe that the little hatch on the back should be silver and the strap black. i think theyre trying to fix this in the next batch
FashionReps,3d2ujz,probablybrody,2,Mon Jul 13 02:20:33 2015 UTC,"It is black/silver on the Black cap, and brown/gold on the navy. I believe this is the corrected version but I could be wrong."
FashionReps,3d3c1s,G0DG0DG0DGOD,4,Mon Jul 13 04:44:49 2015 UTC,"Nope, they come from the exact same factory, except that PerfectKickz is cheaper.  We also have discounts for both of those sites.   Black balmains are by far the closest because the color is really easy to get right.  They will be identical, but I wouldn't say perfect, but good enough that you wouldn't get called out :)"
FashionReps,3d3c1s,Tixoz,2,Mon Jul 13 06:06:01 2015 UTC,Are the UNHS Balmains similar quality to the PerfectKickz jeans?
FashionReps,3d3c1s,rep_out,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:52:57 2015 UTC,I think they're the same.
FashionReps,3d3c1s,Tixoz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:56:58 2015 UTC,What are the flaws? This is just out of curiosity
FashionReps,3d3c1s,aree93,-1,Mon Jul 13 14:56:22 2015 UTC,". Do not buy any other colour than black, all the other reps look really bad. There's a lot of tells but the wash is what really gives it away."
FashionReps,3d3c1s,TopShelfReps,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:58:39 2015 UTC,It cant be that bad
FashionReps,3d3c1s,cumsquatt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:46:10 2015 UTC,It isn't that bad. Out of the 5 jeans i've ordered - there's minor subtleties from the authentic but its very difficult to tell.
FashionReps,3d3c1s,wutangm8,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:59:07 2015 UTC,It isn't. If you can LC jeans based off the wash color like you've seen every pair of balmains ever produced then you might have autism lolol
FashionReps,3d3c1s,TopShelfReps,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:06:34 2015 UTC,Yeah that's insane
FashionReps,3d3c1s,JakeSLac,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:13:04 2015 UTC,yep and wash varies slightly on same pairs
FashionReps,3d3c1s,aree93,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:27:43 2015 UTC,It might sound stupid but if you've seen the authentics of the same pair of replicas then you can clearly tell the difference.
FashionReps,3d3c1s,aree93,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:38:55 2015 UTC,"Btw: compare the ""rips"" and ""tears"" of the replica jeans to the authentics. That's one huge flaw that all balmain replica ""destroyed"" jeans have."
FashionReps,3d3c1s,wutangm8,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:41:18 2015 UTC,What I'm saying is that nobody is going to scrutinize a pair of jeans that hard when you're wearing them.
FashionReps,3d3c1s,aree93,2,Mon Jul 13 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly,  I'm just trying to help out. He's asking about the flaws and I'm telling him that the things that I pointed out are the flaws.   And when you say that it ""isn't that bad""(the wash) look at these replica sandblasted Balmain http://imgur.com/a/Bcu63 and compare them to these authentic ones: http://imgur.com/a/FzYW3. Now answer me this, you don't see the difference?"
FashionReps,3d3c1s,wutangm8,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:21:05 2015 UTC,Ok but that's not something that someone will call out unless they know every single wash of balmains that's ever been made
FashionReps,3d3c1s,aree93,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:37:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, you've got think about what kind of people you're talking about. The people that would call you out are the ones with authentics, those same people spend 1400$ on a pair of jeans and can clearly tell the difference.   I love Balmain, that might be a reason why I can tell them apart so much but it doesn't mean that I would be the only one. More than you know can tell the difference 'cause honestly all replicas just look like shit(excluding the black ones). They look poorly made without any effort put into them which is why even regular people that just simply know the brand will be able to tell."

FashionReps,3d2v3g,NickVsYou,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:00:23 2015 UTC,Yes  Edit: they have to order the item in for you to get QC pics so to send you pictures you do need to pay first but if you don't like the quality of the item they send it back and get you another one and the process repeats until you find one you like.

FashionReps,3d2upi,judged87,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:21:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, any of the trusted dealers on replica-watch.info will have them, generally about $200-300 for a submariner, not sure about other models."
FashionReps,3d2upi,Aiden6,3,Mon Jul 13 03:05:08 2015 UTC,Heres a review. I got this a few months back and I would say it is sure as hell worth the money.  https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/33m1z6/review_11_rolex_submariner_from_timepalacenet/
FashionReps,3d2upi,NonchalantNinja,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:41:45 2015 UTC,Ill break it down for you and help you out.   Most decent reps will be around 350. Some of the best reps out rn are the sea dweller and the ceramic submariner both from noob factory.   The submariner date V5 is out of stock from some trusted dealers and available from others but this last stock has datewheel and sel flaws so check for that in the QC pictures. The GMT-2 is good BUT the movement doesnt let the GMT hand stack correctly so it is a noticeable flaw when compared to the reps. The new JF v2 Yatchmasters are suppose to be decent but they look ugly imo so I dont know the flaws or how they compare. The v2 SD4000 is good but just check that the 6 and 9 markers are straight along with the datewheel not being centered.
FashionReps,3d2upi,Poffstah,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:19:19 2015 UTC,"I would recommend checking rwg or rwi just to get the hang of things. I myself bought a submariner fron twgtwg.com and it looks like it's genuine. Go for the A2836 movement, or else you're just going to get crap. Dont buy swiss movement."

FashionReps,3cxd3g,selekthor,5,Sun Jul 12 03:00:07 2015 UTC,I'm with you on this one. Wearing even a discreet LV backpack like the Michael is gonna stress you out and likely result in it being stolen unless you're really careful.
FashionReps,3cxd3g,Walt_F,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:03:04 2015 UTC,I agree with this going around with a LV bag is just asking to get stolen. Even if its not stolen by someone from your school your basically asking to get jump on your way to or from school.

The customer service with KB turns very poor as soon as you western union him your money. It will take days to get a responce back form him or from his supplier.   If there is a problem with your order, you will automatically be called a liar and it is the ""First time"" he ever had a problem with a customer.

The lining in the wallet is better quality fabric than that of the card holder, as is the packaging the wallet comes with. I also have a passport holder, which is the only piece that has the correct stitching.  The materials on Goyard make it easy to replicate pretty well for cheap, as long as the leather on the inside is actual leather and the stitching holds. I'd go with taobao or Ali on these."

FashionReps,3ces4f,avzt,2,Tue Jul 7 10:12:20 2015 UTC,"I have these. While a great pair of shoes and head turners the flaws are obvious for those who know, which lucky is only a few hah.   Mesh is not dense enough on these reps. The authentics have a very tightly woven pattern and this make it appear slightly darker than the other red tones on the shoe. They have yet to fix this issue. Very heavy on the padding on the inner portion of the shoe. Authentics, not so much. They're idea of ""red"" is more of a pinkish hue. That self-explanatory  Shape is slightly off, mostly in the heel height and around the air bubble. Nothing noticeable once on foot.    That being said, they look great once you are wearing them. I actually took a red marker and colored all the mesh on the shoes and the difference was night and day. It removed some of that pink color as well as making the mesh seem much more authentic.   tl:dr Decent shoe, bad rep. White and blue in this style are much more accurate. For the price, go for it homie."

We asked him to verify himself by having something official message us or contact us, such as a Skype, Live Chat, or Official UNHS Email. He was unable to do that and proceeded to give us a run-a-round on how he can't. I contacted the official UNHS Skype and they had no idea who this guy was, and said he was likely just a fan. He was noticeably disrespectful and irritable in the Modmail, and UNHS has always been really nice and careful with their support. It leads me to believe he is just a fan, maybe looking for some free items through promotion, or just bored with his time. We've decided to ban him for now, maybe he'll provide sufficient proof in the future, it would be great to have a UNHS rep on here, but this guy is just a fan with no real information."

Once they receive the package, they will scan it and find out its the wrong zip code. They will then send it to the correct facility and ship it to you. It will most likely delay your shipment by 1 day.  TLDR: No, you don't have to do anything."

If they start talking to you face to face and they know about Supreme (owned a box logo piece themselves) they might realise. It looks good enough for people to think it's legit if they just pass you in the street and what not.

FashionReps,3c8ftx,Delvonte,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:40:04 2015 UTC,They fixed the italics and the water mark and the double stitching. just got a new one from them and they fixed everything as far as I can tell

FashionReps,3c4z8z,PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES,2,Sun Jul 5 01:32:45 2015 UTC,is that still true? i just got into reps and started reading up on the subreddit and i feel people are saying recently that unhs's supreme hoodies etc. have uncentered bogo or floating e's etc...  can you tell me your opinion on this? i really wanna start ordering this stuff but i dont wanna get burned
FashionReps,3c4z8z,madshrooms,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:24:34 2015 UTC,Well to begin with unhs is one of the most trusted sellers on AliX and has one of the most high quality reps but not all reps are perfect. As for the unhs supreme hoodies they seem to have the floating e  but its not super noticeable at a distance unless someone is inspecting it. From what I've seen BlackJason has the best supreme hoodies (located on taobao)  AliX is safe on the most part but its the sellers you have to be careful for.... as for taobao I'm not as experienced  Hope that helped :)
FashionReps,3c4z8z,AbrahamBapesta,2,Sat Jul 4 22:52:04 2015 UTC,"I just looked at BlackJason's stuff. I'm new to this shit, so please bear with me, but it appears Bhiner is listing items in stock that Taboa says aren't. I really want to nab a Bogo hoodie, particularly the snow camo one, and I know I'll never be able to afford a non-retail real one. Bhiner is saying it's in stock, in my size (S) and that it's only about $60.   Am I looking at it wrong or should I jump on this????"

FashionReps,3bv4ft,avarism,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:05:14 2015 UTC,You can buy an SLP Biker Jacket on StayFashion i believe but the quality won't be the same as the original also you should just buy a biker jacket from H&M or Zara instead. Its under $100 & its better quality than the reps will ever be.
FashionReps,3bv4ft,RodyFashion,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:31:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I already have a zara's biker jacket and it's quite nice, just looking for some alternative."
FashionReps,3bv4ft,yung-nivek,2,Thu Jul 2 16:39:31 2015 UTC,the SLP Biker Jacket is like $700 on stayfashion lol. Tbh dude you aren't gonna get a decent biker jacket from China for less than $100. If you're looking to buy a new one just check out Zara or H&M as they basically make SLP replicas lol
FashionReps,3bv4ft,repthrows,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:25:44 2015 UTC,Yeah and I don't like it as well. Guess I'll wait for some more zara.

FashionReps,3br8yz,ChasinPatMan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"Biggest and quickest tell is the wash. So many weird ""light"" washes that are out.

FashionReps,3br8yz,aree93,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:19:35 2015 UTC,The rip patches on balmains are more random. The reps are consistent from pair to pair.   Rep balmains aren't the best. Only people with real balmains could possibly tell based on wash.

FashionReps,3brc59,DeadStockWizard,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:38:23 2015 UTC,"The legit ones? Because they're super hyped, and based on the fact that I've never seen this particular one, it's most likely rare and very old. It's also M, which is rare (not as much as small). They're also tnf so they aren't low quality, with the designing of Supreme this makes them nice (to those who like Supreme)."

FashionReps,3bo5qw,ManUpKyle,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:35:52 2015 UTC,"How was the material on it?

FashionReps,3bo5qw,polopolo16,3,Wed Jul 1 01:07:10 2015 UTC,Definitely not a wool-like material and it isn't floppy or flimsy. I can't remember exactly what the legit S cap feels like but I know it isn't far from what the rep feels like.

Supreme however is world famous, and especially now there are TONS of hype beasts, so if you wanna wear it go ahead, but be prepared to come up with where you bought it, how much you paid and at least have some idea about Supreme.  I wasn't intended to be mean or turn the guy away, but he wants Bape and Supreme which are far from simple."

People only wear Bape and Supreme because people will go ""wow he wears Supreme"" which is one of the reasons OP is looking for those clothes.  There's no argument that Bape and Supreme are not ""basic"", Bape is a full zip hoodie with a mask on the front, to me that isn't exactly basic. That's what I was saying, that he isn't buying Supreme because of the way it looks or because he likes it, but rather because of the reputation it has and what people will think when he wears it."
FashionReps,3bf2ro,borzoixboxchaos,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:25:39 2015 UTC,What are you going on about? Anybody on this subreddit is buying bc of name brand recognition. None of these clothes have anywhere NEAR the quality or fit of the authentic. That is the main reason I rarely wear my reps.

FashionReps,3bcyx8,yanayam,2,Sun Jun 28 15:29:46 2015 UTC,Uniqlo doesn't cost a fortune though. $20 for a sweatshirt isn't that expensive considering the higher end brands like reigning champ go for $100+. Quality blows H&M out of the water.

FashionReps,3bf8f9,RepCity,14,Sun Jun 28 18:14:43 2015 UTC,No. You could literally walk into a supreme store and ask for bags and they would give them to you for free. The idea that people would spend any money at all on a branded plastic bag is depressing.
FashionReps,3bf8f9,TheRedComedian,-8,Sun Jun 28 18:53:54 2015 UTC,"Didn't know that, but they definitely won't do that for Hermes and Gucci and all that, which is why there's a market for replica bags of those brands and people pay extra for receipts and bags."
FashionReps,3bf8f9,Dogexecutive,5,Sun Jun 28 19:03:11 2015 UTC,That's because they sell replicas as authentic. They are scammers dude

Even on their good one, it has the right box (which I haven't seen elsewhere) but the wrong screwdriver, which is a pretty glaring flaw."

FashionReps,3bbqkz,imaqdodger,0,Wed Jul 8 22:04:19 2015 UTC,Overall pattern of the wallet is wrong. Not bad for a $35 wallet though. The box as expect is a typical bad quality fake
FashionReps,3bbqkz,basedyeezy123,2,Sat Jun 27 19:55:13 2015 UTC,Explain?
FashionReps,3bbqkz,AggrOHMYGOD,2,Sat Jun 27 23:01:59 2015 UTC,"Using this as a comparison from the LV website. Authentic has 7 columns as far as I can tell. This one only has 6. Also, the black boxes shouldn't have a sideways pattern."
FashionReps,3bbqkz,basedyeezy123,2,Sun Jun 28 00:30:12 2015 UTC,"Also, look where the wallet bends. It's bending at the wrong spot because the wallet's pattern is wrong. It's supposed to fold inbetween the black and white squares, but in this case, its folding in the middle of a black square."
FashionReps,3bbqkz,AggrOHMYGOD,2,Sun Jun 28 00:41:00 2015 UTC,"Naw you're right, it folds in the wrong spot. But yeah, for 35 dollars, who gives a fuck hahahaha. A friend of mine had the authentic LV Monogram wallet and he thought my Damier wallet was legit. So I'm pretty impressed with it. For 35 bucks I'd def recommend it over those other sites which charge you 100+ dollars or w/e. Definitely go with exportclothes and this agent and you'll be set."

The only flaw on them is the accent stitching around the quarter, which isn't tucked in.

First one: the wash is off and the seaming is completely wrong.   Second one: the wash is very very bad(not even close to the original).   Third one: Is probably the best out of the three but still has some wash-lines(?) on the thighs that aren't as visible on the authentic.

FashionReps,3b16ro,iamblayne,6,Thu Jun 25 03:29:45 2015 UTC,"It completely matters on the maker of the reps, Union House sizes in U.S. sizing, while others do Chinese sizing which is usually 1-2 sizes smaller like others say.  The best thing to do is get measurements from the seller beforehand. That way you end up with what you want and not guess."
FashionReps,3b16ro,borzoixboxchaos,3,Thu Jun 25 03:54:01 2015 UTC,"general rule of thumb is to go up once or twice, depending on what type of clothes it is/brand. for example: go up a single size on something tts, but if its a fitted brand like gucci then you should go up twice."
FashionReps,3b16ro,youngmiquel,3,Thu Jun 25 03:37:52 2015 UTC,"i'd say it's a pretty safe bet to go up at least a size if you're going for designer stuff. i usually wear a medium to a large in most clothes (EX. american apparel, h&m, hanes, gildan) but with YSL, CDG, givenchy i need to go XL"
FashionReps,3b16ro,mikeyj6969,2,Thu Jun 25 03:49:29 2015 UTC,Rep shirts are almost always a size small. Check measurements on everything if they're available. Keep in mind a US chest size in XL is about 121 cm. UNHS tees are 116cm chest which is technically still XL but smaller than a US XL.

FashionReps,3azkh2,eth0ng,2,Wed Jun 24 20:34:58 2015 UTC,"Most camps have terrible stitched on bogos, bad tags, and eyelets don't line up when the camp is folded in half."

FashionReps,3az5dj,Spurs4life22,6,Wed Jun 24 17:49:33 2015 UTC,For 17 bucks its not bad. I personally would've paid the extra 10 or whatever it might be for the higher quality ones with the correct drawstrings and color of the bape camo.

FashionReps,3axi6r,Dil26,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:32:25 2015 UTC,"you need a agent. taobao is pretty complicated the first time ordering. after finding whatever you want to purchase, you need to find an agent (someone who will recieve the product in china, and then ship it to wherever youre at), after you find your agent (there are a ton but bhiner, zarmark, mistertao, dotdotbuy, and taobaoing are the best. id reccomend dotdotbuy only cause hes the cheapest) you need to go over to their own website and choose the products. if you need help post on the sub or try looking @ the taobao guide on here."
FashionReps,3axi6r,Dil26,2,Thu Jun 25 03:28:01 2015 UTC,ok. Also how much do they charge for this service?
FashionReps,3axi6r,Dil26,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:56:18 2015 UTC,"it really depends on the item. i dont wanna give you misinformation so just go over to the searchbar and type in ""taobao agent"". all i know is that dotdotbuy is the cheapest and REALLY fast."
FashionReps,3axi6r,Da4orce,2,Thu Jun 25 04:17:35 2015 UTC,Its telling me those are $147.   Is that right?
FashionReps,3axi6r,Rep-tile,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:43:39 2015 UTC,thats a place holder price. the place holder price is 880 yuan but theyre always on sale for i think 88 yuan. thats a bit over 14 dollars.
FashionReps,3axi6r,based___god,2,Fri Jun 26 04:06:07 2015 UTC,When do you think they will be on sale again?
FashionReps,3axi6r,Charly_36,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:15:44 2015 UTC,theyre on sale right now. theyre ALWAYS on sale idk why its coming up for you as 880. if it still doesnt show up as sale then message me.
FashionReps,3axi6r,based___god,2,Sat Jun 27 03:56:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I see the sale price. But through Bhiner it shows the original price.
FashionReps,3axi6r,wutangm8,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:38:46 2015 UTC,"oh youre right, thats why i dont really mess with bhiner. im afraid it'll charge me for original instead of sales price. i THINK theres a way to add the sales price. if you cant find it then use dotdotbuy, cheapest and you can imput the sales price."
FashionReps,3axi6r,Charly_36,2,Sun Jun 28 18:53:12 2015 UTC,Just copped 3 Tees. The price is so cheap. Used dotdotbuy. Thanks a lot for the link.
FashionReps,3axi6r,Dil26,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:22:38 2015 UTC,please do a review when you get em. and how much did you pay for each/shipping/agent fee? thanks
FashionReps,3axi6r,borzoixboxchaos,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:28:46 2015 UTC,"RL is 130€ for a shirt and about 90-100€ for a polo. At a sale/clearance you get max ~50% off but you better be the first one there, shit sells out quick. So getting clean looking reps for 20€ is interesting for most non-americans."
FashionReps,3ayjxr,szymonbrodziak,2,Wed Jun 24 15:14:40 2015 UTC,"Well here are your basic reps:  Union House (UNHS) delivers SP (Super Perfect) quality box logo hoodies. Typical flaws with UNHS hoodies are floating e's, large hoods, and small errors. The biggest flaw they have is their floating e.  BlackJason7 produces SMP (Super Max Perfecr) quality, these are very nice, the floating e is still there but not as apparent. His hoodies are a bit better quality than UNHS but the problem is that his logos are not stiff and do not bend, which is evident of being fake. And to top it all off his box logo is of the incorrect grain, UNHS however does have a correct grain.  So they both have their flaws and perks its up to you. Others are usually subpar."
FashionReps,3ayjxr,borzoixboxchaos,2,Wed Jun 24 16:33:35 2015 UTC,Thanks man. And do you maybe know how frequently blackjason or unhs restock? Because I'm looking for black bogo hoodie (with white supreme sign) and they both dont have them right now. I've only spotted it at store called 77kg. Is it a lot worse quality than blackjason/unhs?
FashionReps,3ayrb3,themlkman,2,Wed Jun 24 16:08:12 2015 UTC,"Without looking I'd say you may be out of luck unfortunately, unless you got one personally made.  Also if its possible can you post some pics of your jacket if its not too much hassle? I'm really torn on getting the map or plain black. Thanks :)"
FashionReps,3ayrb3,sxt60,2,Wed Jun 24 20:24:55 2015 UTC,"Ahhh i really want a hood :( the map jacket i got was from UNHS i think but they dont sell them anymore, the materials were really good and the print was 1:1, the black one is also the same, it depends on what look you want really, i think the black is better"
FashionReps,3ayrb3,sxt60,2,Wed Jun 24 20:31:34 2015 UTC,I think they look really good without the hood as it gives a more clean look :) and David is selling some still so I may cop one :)
FashionReps,3ayrb3,Dogexecutive,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:36:13 2015 UTC,I believe the flaws are that map placement and order are off
FashionReps,3ayquf,vip0,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:04:53 2015 UTC,Looks pretty good to me. Only flaw that I can tell is that the box doesn't seem centered. Could just be the way it's folded though.
FashionReps,3ayquf,RolloTamaci,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:59:10 2015 UTC,Yeah the white ann. tee's are off centered. I heard the grey/black is good

FashionReps,3aykvn,Tixoz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:14:21 2015 UTC,hmm i guess its a bit hit and miss to be honest. It just seems the reviews are realllyy sketchy (not real) and in some cases take your money and never send the item/fake tracking number.

FashionReps,3axm5h,youngmiquel,4,Wed Jun 24 09:04:14 2015 UTC,Dotdotbuy is the cheapest hands down.. 5% service fee (3 if you have a student email address) and like 20$ ems shipping for anythig under 1kg but in order to navigate the site you have to basically use chrome to translate everything for you
FashionReps,3axm5h,ii5i,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:03:44 2015 UTC,whats a student email?? thanks btw

FashionReps,3ax9k8,Airplane_Mode,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:13:23 2015 UTC,I'm always a skeptic with these posts. He knows you're going to post it so of course you're going to get great service and a decent product because it's easy marketing. I prefer my companies with consistency at a fair price and I don't feel David offers that despite his numerous praise here daily.
FashionReps,3ax9k8,electric_feels,3,Wed Jun 24 12:15:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've been more or less fucked by David, so he's not getting any more of my business.  Order shoes and request pics -> I am promised pics  David ships without pics -> I am promised refund + shipping costs back  Receive shoes that don't look good -> Ask to return and tell him shipping to China is ~$40 (which apparently is not OK)  David changes his mind and just paypals me $25 to $35 (don't remember exactly).  And the first time I ordered from David (Bred 1's) he sent me 1 SMP shoe and 1 UA shoe, which he later admitted to when I showed him pics - but basically just told me I could get a small discount on my next order."
FashionReps,3ax9k8,ieatass_ama,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:23:54 2015 UTC,"My first order from David was also a bad experience so I'm honestly not the biggest fan either, but I was surprised David actually shipped me my stuff even after being taken off as partner or whatever.    I get your complaints of consistency too, but is anyone really consistent when ordering from China?"

FashionReps,3avy3p,OchoChino,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:40:37 2015 UTC,"I mean, everyone knew it wasn't real and the print isn't as good as it should be. It's more of the threads and sewing of the jersey because at the bottom, I have loose threads and already unloosened the bottom of the shirt."

FashionReps,3avy3p,arsenalboy8,3,Tue Jun 23 23:24:42 2015 UTC,I'm just a fan of the design. That logic goes for every brand though doesn't it? Why would you buy an off-white t-shirt for £150 when it's just a £5 tee with a print on it? Thanks for letting me know about the sizing though!

FashionReps,3avkd9,AxelWanSumBred,3,Tue Jun 23 21:12:30 2015 UTC,Have you tried googling Taobao agent or looking in the sidebar? Don't be lazy.
FashionReps,3avkd9,Airplane_Mode,2,Tue Jun 23 21:53:48 2015 UTC,"yoybuy, bhiner, dotdotbuy, these are all agents you can use.   I recently ordered a pair of shoes through dotdotbuy, they're pretty fast, ordered the shoes through them on Saturday, and they received the shoes, and shipped them out yesterday. I'll update when I receive the shoes to see how fast their shipping is. People have said bhiner has expensive shipping too, but I've never used them."
FashionReps,3avkd9,noside10,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:18:07 2015 UTC,does dotdotbuy give QC pics?
FashionReps,3avkd9,Hoothoog,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:47:39 2015 UTC,"Not that I know of. Bhiner does a quote, and gives you QC pics though. But bhiner is really expensive shipping. dotdotbuy is all in Chinese so MAYBE they do QC pics? Not 100% sure."

FashionReps,3avkd9,youngmiquel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:01:22 2015 UTC,"okay so i think ive found out what i need but just in case, please read the post i just made. http://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/3b1746/someone_please_help_me_ordering_off_dotdotbuy/ the other thing i wanted to ask was lets say i order 3 things from the same seller, do they arrive to dotdotbuy's warehouse at the same time or sepereatly? and if they do does he ship each piece individually or with the others? last thing was lets say i ordered from a bunch of different sellers, does he ship everything together or does he ship by seller orders? thanks!!!"
FashionReps,3avkd9,noside10,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:19:11 2015 UTC,"I looked at your thread and I'm not sure why the price is blank. You might have to wait for someone who has more experience with that to help you.   1) They SHOULD arrive at the warehouse at the same time since they're all from the same seller  2) dotdotbuy lets you take control of how you want the items shipped. when they arrive in their warehouse, and pass inspection, they get put in your ""storage"", which then you pay for shipping and they ship everything to you, so it depends if you want it shipped together, or not  3) read answer 2"
FashionReps,3avkd9,youngmiquel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:44:12 2015 UTC,alright bro thanks so much. i was looking around for guides and there was only 1 but it was a video in broken english. glad you helped me.

FashionReps,3arwzz,fuccboisupremo,2,Tue Jun 23 08:00:08 2015 UTC,Hood feels very large but that might be the way it was designed + comparing side by side photos authentic hoods look a tiny bit smaller but that might be because of the angle/distance the photos were taken at. Thanks for the info!

FashionReps,3arv88,inexpungeable29,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:32:03 2015 UTC,"You know I've looked at this a couple of times and I agree, the person trying to detract from purchasing is someone else in the same thread that outright calls the OP outrageous for his listing price. Walt_F's post was implicitly asking for that kind of response.  Calling a post thread crapping is the least professional response a mod could have. if someone said that to me, I would be extremely confused and want to know more"
FashionReps,3arv88,autourbanbot,0,Wed Jun 24 05:28:25 2015 UTC,"Calling a post thread crapping is the least professional response a mod could have   It is a practically universal term used on internet forums.  http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=thread+crapping  I have witnessed veteran users and moderators alike call out threadcrappers on a replica forum much larger and more developed than ours. One time, in a situation EXACTLY like this. Only instead of a Supreme box logo hoodie and the floating E flaw, it was a Noob V3 PAM111 and the Incabloc flaw."
FashionReps,3arv88,Tixoz,3,Wed Jun 24 23:10:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't say the word was wrong, but thread crapping is vague. You shouldn't use urbandictionary or other forums as a reference. We are our own sub and the definition of thread crapping in the link you provided about sales threads is more negatively down-voted than it is upvoted, so it's very much out of context"
FashionReps,3arv88,borzoixboxchaos,0,Thu Jun 25 01:11:48 2015 UTC,"Nah. That's all very flawed reasoning. I spelled out very clearly what constitutes thread crapping on this sub:   Quite simply: if you do not have something nice to say (""good luck with the sale"" or similar), and are not interested in purchasing, do not comment on sales posts.   And why can't urbandictionary or other (more advanced) forums be used as references? Just because? Doesn't make much sense.  But I see why you're being such a contrarian  Interesting that this was is your first post ever to Fashionreps, and first post on reddit in 10 months.  You stopped posting on Reddit in Late July 2014. TTWPMike started posting September 2014.  You and TTWPMike both frequent /r/leagueoflegends, /r/exo, and often talk about being a Bronze player in LoL.  Pretty weird huh? You must be the same person. Or is it just a crazy coincidence?  You can whine about your banning on Repsneakers as much as you want. It won't change anything. I will not allow you or other self-righteous people like you to get in the way of progress for this sub."
FashionReps,3arv88,beginningatdawn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:33:55 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of thread crapping :      v. Thread crapping occurs when a person comes into a thread and posts something contrary to the spirit/intent of the thread, often derailing the discussion or turning it into an argument.     Coming into a thread titled ""I love my new Apple Macintosh!"", and posting ""PCs are better and cheaper"" is thread crapping.    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"

FashionReps,3arvcg,RetroSupreme,3,Tue Jun 23 00:29:32 2015 UTC,Where did you buy the 20th from?
FashionReps,3arvcg,SimplyJoseph,3,Tue Jun 23 02:00:35 2015 UTC,"found the listing on craigslist, bought it through paypal. Seller said it was 100% in the invoice, it came with the supreme invoice, bag, and stickers that were the same kind that supreme included with orders during that drop.  Also the seller apparently owns or is affiliated with a sneaker consignment shop in San Francisco because the invoice and listing were labeled as so."
FashionReps,3arvcg,Spurs4life22,3,Tue Jun 23 02:25:51 2015 UTC,"if unhs reps are the best around, then this has to be authentic because there is no comparison. I have not seen any reps that get the tag completely right and the 20th stamp right as well. Only thing that is off is the tag is a little bit stiffer than my other supreme tags, it was not noticeable but i really scrutinized this shirt for every little detail that made it stand out as different.   I am thinking that all authentic shirts will have some differences in them due to quality control issues."
FashionReps,3arvcg,Spurs4life22,2,Tue Jun 23 02:28:31 2015 UTC,Can you link to the seller please my man?

FashionReps,3asc3q,iheartraybans,3,Tue Jun 23 02:56:37 2015 UTC,How's the difference in quality of the Ray bans you sell compared to the authentic ones?
FashionReps,3asc3q,Burro123,4,Tue Jun 23 03:17:47 2015 UTC,"First off, I would consider myself to sell a high level of fakes. I say this because simply from a looks perspective they are just about spot on. I am yet to find a glaring flaw in any of my pairs. Occasionally you will notice a very minor issue like the ""p"" not being as clear as you would want but overall looks wise its near-impossible to find a mistake.  From a material perspective you will notice a difference mainly in two places, the metal and the screws. The screws are generally a bit lighter than authentic ray ban screws, causing the hinges to be lighter than they would be on an authentic pair. With the metal, you will notice that it an overall lighter material used. The official ray ban metal (and plastic for that matter) tends to be a heavier material, giving an authentic pair noticeably more weight. While this does not tend to be an issue, the screws on a fake pair tend to give out much faster than on a fake pair. That being said, you can always bring them into your local lenscrafters or any other store who will replace them for free most of the time."
FashionReps,3asc3q,avarism,3,Tue Jun 23 03:33:01 2015 UTC,is there gold signet rayban reps?
FashionReps,3asc3q,hattmall,2,Tue Jun 23 18:44:25 2015 UTC,Whats a good price for fake raybans?
FashionReps,3asc3q,hattmall,3,Tue Jun 23 04:03:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, the first thing to know here is that the markup is HUGE. I purchase my pairs for $5 a unit and I sell for up to $45, so its important to know how to haggle (NOTE: I am in America, I would not necessarily apply all of this to overseas purchases). My general price point starts around $30 but I am willing to drop down to $25 or $20 based on the age and popularity of the model. This is why it is important to ask sellers questions. Like any other rep, we have certain models with which the quality has since been updated, and others where they style simply does not sell (I had clear, non prescription ray bans at a point in time, i was willing to accept anything for those). So, to give you a short answer, $30 is a fair price point in general, but i would say that there is a $10 dollar variance based on the seller and the model, and always do your best to haggle or to try to work out a better price (I know I always will give people a better price if they buy multiple pairs!)"
FashionReps,3asc3q,ii5i,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:23:31 2015 UTC,So what about the ones on Ioffer for like $10 - $15 are they junk?
FashionReps,3asc3q,basedyeezy123,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:02:31 2015 UTC,Yes. With those you are generally getting the lowest quality of glasses out there with the ray ban logo screen printed in the corner. simply stated you're buying crap and I can guarantee you its worth the upgrade to the $30 price range
FashionReps,3asc3q,blacktothafuture,2,Tue Jun 23 05:23:07 2015 UTC,are there good 2132 reps? i've mostly only seen 2140 so far
FashionReps,3asc3q,Gadar,2,Tue Jun 23 06:47:01 2015 UTC,"Is it normal for the $30 2140s to not be as ""crooked toward your face"" like the original wayfarers? Not sure if my rep is the same model, but i see people with gen wayfarers and its really angled"
FashionReps,3asc3q,yung_lean,2,Tue Jun 23 10:20:09 2015 UTC,"I have found that the rep 2140s can be crooked towards your face. As you said, the angle might not be as strong but it is definitely noticable to the person wearing them. I wish I had a better answer to give you but to summarize, they are angled generally just not as much."

FashionReps,3asc3q,honestasianman,2,Tue Jun 23 05:44:23 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, to be honest I havent heard a thing about this. Fake Ray Bans are not polarized, but I assume that they aren't too bad for you unless you are excessively observing the sun. that being said, if you need polarized sunglasses, toss the extra dollars out there for some polarized lenses."

FashionReps,3arxv7,basedyeezy123,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:01:18 2015 UTC,"They're pretty legit. You'll be SOL if there's an order problem.  I received the wrong bag size (LV Brooklyn MM instead of PM) and they blamed me for not specifying on the order form even though I did. Lol. Eventually I got them to own up to the mistake and they offered me the usual $15 discount on a future order. Not my preferred customer service anymore, but you win some and you lose some.  Most of the time you'll be fine though. Based on what I've seen, they are good about sending you well-QCed stuff. And their prices are very fair. Especially if you're buying bags.  Fill out the order form with what you want, email it to them, and they'll edit it with the prices and total shipped cost."

It's a Medium, which ended up being a tad too tight on me, so I'm trying to get rid of it. For reference, I'm 1.75m and ~80kg.  The quality of this tee is very good, and I believe 77kg's stuff has been reviewed here in the past. I can take some pics of the tee if you'd like, but it's identical to the photos provided in the Taobao listing I provided above. The only difference is that mine doesn't have the cardboard 'Supreme' tag since I took that off when trying it on.  I'd be willing to let it go for $25 + shipping (I'm in the US), which I feel is fair considering I've only worn it once. Let me know if you're interested."

FashionReps,3almr9,bn879,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:59:59 2015 UTC,I'm curious as well. Been looking for one forever.

I wore it quite a lot but still got very lucky and sold it for a high $200 and a pair of air force 1's, there are other brands who have released this dipdye shit in the last year and a half, so you might want to try that.  the only reason why this sells high to this day is because lolrafsemensXDDD  it is a nice piece though ngl"
FashionReps,3am302,jacobegan,4,Sun Jun 21 15:45:18 2015 UTC,That's floating e though :(
FashionReps,3am302,TTWPMike,-1,Sun Jun 21 18:08:35 2015 UTC,No need to thread crap. OP posted clear pictures of the flaw and you bringing attention serves no purpose. It just detracts from his sales thread.
FashionReps,3am302,TTWPMike,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:29:31 2015 UTC,Aren't you the one that said the other day that if something if off to say why. Im not thread crapping. It's an important detail that others should be aware of before potentially buying something the OP did not mention.
FashionReps,3am302,TTWPMike,0,Mon Jun 22 03:03:09 2015 UTC,"Nope. That was not me. But it doesn't matter because this absolutely is thread crapping. Try this on any other forum and you will be met with the same reply.  The floating E flaw is a well-known flaw that is found on the vast majority of these hoodies.   It is clearly pictured, and if someone has a problem with the flaw, they will simply not buy.  Provided the seller includes honest and detailed pics, there is no reason for non-buyers to make comments criticizing the sales post.  Your comment was uncalled for. No debate."
FashionReps,3am302,Walt_F,0,Mon Jun 22 03:29:46 2015 UTC,"That was Tixoz, someone who had the right idea in mind, unlike yourself There is no debate, because you don't know why I made my comment, you just assume it's to ruin his thread. I know for a fact not everyone that sees these threads is a rep-supreme expert and might not recognize the errors.   And that wouldn't be the case on any other forum because not all mods address people as poorly nor publicly as you just did. Educational posts are the backbone of this sub, we comment all the time about the floating e from UNHS, we are not criticizing their work in order to prevent people from using them, just spreading the message."
FashionReps,3am302,szymonbrodziak,2,Mon Jun 22 03:51:08 2015 UTC,"You're making no sense.  A sales thread is not the appropriate setting for ""educational"" comments. Use common sense please. There are a million other opportunities to educate people if that is your goal.  It's ridiculous that you believe this is even remotely appropriate.  I have witnessed users on other replica forums get harshly reprimanded for comments on sales threads almost exactly like yours. They are handled publicly and said thread crappers are deservedly shamed. You evidently take our lax policies on this sub for granted.   Hold this ban"
FashionReps,3am302,mughu,0,Mon Jun 22 04:38:25 2015 UTC,I'm willing to go lower than the BIN because it's not an excellent rep. It was just a round estimate really.

FashionReps,3am302,Paddyr83,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:36:29 2015 UTC,"Want to sell this hoodie to get an authentic one so looking for a quick sale.  BIN: £60 (includes +4% and shipping fees inside UK)  I'd say it was a good price for this hoodie, condition is 9/10 worn it a few times no signs of wear or marks.  If there is a lot of interest I'll be taking offers but I'm not going to charge rape prices as it's only a rep.  Size: Large, fits pretty TTS. Measurements are 57cm pit to pit and 70cm length.

FashionReps,3amlr2,oJellyTots,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:37:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for support guys. Sorry for being so dumb with this sidebar thing cause it clearly says all I want to know. I'm not american and completely new to reddit (created account solely for this purpose) so please forgive me ;) Also, I have one more thing to ask: I've visited UNHS site (because I've read that they make good quality supreme reps) and on their site they have both ""normal"" black box logo and tonal black and they even have link to their aliexpress store there, but I don't know why the offers on aliexpress look like plain black hoodies, without box logo. Do u have any ideas? Do you know how frequently they restock they products, because right now it looks like black hoodies are sold out on their aliexpress site. here's the link: http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Union-House-UNHS-Sup-Supremes-Exclusive-Sale-1-1edition-Box-Logo-Hoodie-Multiply-black-burgundy/1036352_32311551550.html?spm=0.0.0.0.2K2Tf3  Also, do u think that this offer from aliexpress will be good pick, or - as oJellyTots said - taobao using an agent will be a better option?  EDIT: How do I know, when searching on taobao, that the item is SMP quality? Just the good looking photos is probabily not enough, i guess..."

FashionReps,3agl3f,Holmework,2,Sat Jun 20 00:57:25 2015 UTC,"It was a pretty limited collab release, Titolo x Asics ""Papercut""  camped outside a boutique, if i recall correctly there was only 15 pairs released in New Zealand, im sure you can find them on ebay though.  Reps to retails, obviously the attention to detail isn't quite there. The reps have pretty messed up toe boxes from time to time and heard the suede material pairs are trash. I got denim though and I actually love them. Very comfortable, they fit quite small though so size up.   I reckon they're about 90% on point, under scrutiny they're gonna pass as legit, I had to fix the stripes logo on the side because it had alot of overlap, only took about 5 minutes with a box cutter knife though"

Apart from the horrible packaging and the fact it was called 'Sex in the City,' it was terrible and I ended up with a severe allergic reaction.  I'm gonna say it's not worth it. Unless you run through bottles of cologne and there is no way you can afford the real stuff, I'd just stick to authentic, especially because it lasts longer and is the real thing. When you start buying rep cologne are you buying it because of the name or because of the actual scent? It's not like clothes where a shirt is a shirt; there's chemicals and additives that get it to a specific formula that you can't replicate without losing something. If I've made a mistake, please correct me. But otherwise I'd just buy the real stuff."
FashionReps,3adiue,illuminatihotline,2,Fri Jun 19 08:23:23 2015 UTC,"Oh wow that's crazy...I wonder if its like the from the same chinesen labs that make the bath salts, because Cologne is just like a mixture of chemicals pretty much"
FashionReps,3adiue,tfot,3,Fri Jun 19 15:25:21 2015 UTC,Big difference between rep and tester. Tester is the authentic cologne just in a tester bottle. Check out some whole sale sites. Nothing better then a clean scent.

FashionReps,3adiue,Alimoose,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:42:22 2015 UTC,"Well hopefully he isn't selling higher quality reps and calling them testers. Testers are supposed to be the real cologne but without the original box and most of the time without the cap. $50 is a great deal though, especially for Tom Ford. I'm not sure why the missing cap and box make it so cheap, but testers are usually around that price, so if you don't mind that, then it's the best way to go when it comes to buying cologne."

I wear it all the time and I've had a couple of problems. The screws seem to come loose fairly easy so I have to tighten them about once a day. It is already showing very small scratches on it. Thankfully, it isn't turning my wrist green and it does look pretty good. Looking at it on my wrist I don't think anyone would know that it wasn't authentic, but I expect that after a longer period of wear that it'll show a lot of scratches."

If it's worth it, I might order through dotdotbuy. My first time buying from taobao so there's a lot of stuff, still not sure which is the best agent.   That's crazy it was only four days, is that the standard shipping time or did you pay extra for faster shipping?"
FashionReps,39z87f,OchoChino,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:40:16 2015 UTC,The lowest top up for dotdotbuy is 10 US i think.  As for shipping this was the third cheapest option. they say 5-10 days max which cost about 120 Chinese for 1.100 kg soo umm about $19 US. This was the first time i had used Taobao and another post suggested dotdotbuy

FashionReps,39x5r2,fyyag,2,Tue Jun 16 06:08:55 2015 UTC,"It doesn't go too deep I don't think. Well personally, I like to wear nice instantly recognisable brands. Growing up I had to buy a lot of clothes from Thrift shops because both my parents were studying at University. Once I got my own income throughout school I started buying nice clothes, people actually started complementing me because the things I wore didn't look like they were smeared with snot and left in a corner for 3 years. I quickly started to run out of money buying nice clothes, when I realised that I could get the same item for literally 30% of the price, I remember my first replica item was an Adidas jacket. It took weeks to ship but finally came and I was stoked. Since then I've been half and half with my replicas. Usually things like jeans, boots and jackets I stick to legit brands for quality, but when a brand offers nothing more than hype I always go replica, so a lot of my t shirts are replica, some replica Jordan's, replica hats and shit. Really at first it was to fit in, but now I just enjoy mixing quality clothes with really nice brands and getting compliments over it. It's actually kinda addicting once you spend less than $80 on a jacket and you get a shitload of compliments on it."

Some tips for me getting good stuff is when they have photos on asian models vs models from catwalks and the actual designers photos. Also I look at their feedback. The ones you posted seem to have photos in their plastic wrappers which leads me to believe they are photos of what they manufacture. Also 90% feedback is pretty good - I dont go lower than 85%. Just keep an eye out for asian sizing as its quite different from standard sizing.

Regardless, I'm super excited for this and wish you luck!  Since you want to use your site as a portal to your stock, I recommend tagging your pictures with some kind of code or number, so when people skype you than can be like ""Yeah I want S142 sz 42, B245, W42"". It would help you keep track of inventory, and also make placing orders faster and make the process easier for everyone."

Like im talking material that isn't even good enough to call a shirt, like I had one and the sizing was WAY off, like two sizes too small and the print got washed off after a few times wearing it. Also the material was so thin you could barely even call it a shirt. Not all 20$ shirts are that bad but BE CAREFUL because there is plenty of bad reps out there. But the UNHS quality shirt should be much better, is it 60$ worth of quality? Probably not, you should be sure to ask for more detailed pictures in the items you are interested in.

FashionReps,39bpj9,wutangm8,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:57:26 2015 UTC,"The trunks and ties are a nice pickup! But the wallet is really bad. The card slots aren't center with the stitching around it and the overall quality looks sloppy, especially the ID flap and that top right corner in the picture where the wallet is open. Plus the ""Louis Vuitton Paris"" text on the box is facing the wrong way, which is a dead giveaway. Definitely go for the authentic wallet, or even go for one of the more nicer reps which'll run you about $100-$150. The difference in quality with either of those will stun you compared to the wallet you've received."

We sweat over the smallest details, when really, most high-grade reps are more than accurate enough to write any minor flaws off as innocent factory inconsistencies.  All credit goes to Fakemaster on RWI."
FashionReps,39bllj,jj_north,2,Wed Jun 10 17:39:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly, some people are extremely anal about everything. Bitching about something minor like a spot on the sole or stitching that's slightly off. You're buying items from a Chinese bootlegger, be thankful that sellers even send out QC pics. You are getting stuff that looks 90 to 99% the same as the authentics for a fraction of the price.   And seriously, no-one will ever see or notice those small flaws or inconsistencies. If you get called out just be confident and play your part. For instance: when you're wearing a 20k AP and only wear designer/brand clothes, while you're 19, drive a 3k car and live in the hood, people will get suspicious. As long as you look like you can afford it nobody will call you out."

FashionReps,39azft,Foruncande,2,Wed Jun 10 15:12:40 2015 UTC,i don't own any sunglass reps but there's debate one whether or not sunglass reps block uv rays or not.  i've talked to two optometrists that have suggested purchasing a uv meter to see if the reps are able to block uva/uvb.
FashionReps,39azft,cumsquatt,3,Wed Jun 10 16:04:05 2015 UTC,Yeah the raybans vendor I buy from shows pictures of their sunglasses in a tester. I'm ordering a pair of Oakleys that say they have UV protection but don't show a picture of a tester.

FashionReps,399406,nosupport,4,Wed Jun 10 06:18:59 2015 UTC,You can try to ask the seller if he can do that. Otherwise any local eyeglasses store can do that with no issues.
FashionReps,399406,lospokedash,3,Wed Jun 10 06:21:19 2015 UTC,Go to your local optician for the lenses. There is zero room for mistakes when it comes to your eyes and vision. Quality control is way more important in comparison to reps.

FashionReps,39603h,Osoconceited,2,Tue Jun 9 14:35:06 2015 UTC,"Jacket arrived in about 2.5 weeks after ordering because it took the seller a while to ship it, still a nice enough shipping time to the EU. It's very thin, I wear a white shirt in the fitpic but if I wore a black one you'd probably see it through the jacket. I was expecting this though and I like it.  You can flex a shirt with a nice print or other brand through the jacket. The jacket came pretty wrinkled up because it was in a simple plastic package, not in a box or anything.   Only thing that I didn't like is that there's some (very) small ink stains above the Pigalle logo as you can see in the picture. I might be able to wash that off, though. I literally just got the windbreaker in the mail.  Edit: I sized up and bought the jacket in XL which fits perfect. I'm usually M/L 1.85m 75KG"

BLACK with purple however was a general release and more suitable to be worn. The LV logo, which was cancelled,as well as the ""Serpentine"", which was a Japan only release for the opening of one of the stores, are very rare and would be obviously fake. I actually owned one last season and sold it for $450, so the only box logo tees I would recommend are the 20th anniversaries, they resell real ones at $150, which is a bit easier to swallow as opposed to $300+. If you have any other questions let me know."

FashionReps,3942bh,wutangm8,2,Tue Jun 9 17:58:26 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, you are correct. However, human interaction doesn't work like this. For example: If I show up to class sporting a brand new Cartier Love bracelet (estimated value $5,000), someone will take notice and ask me multiple questions about it. Sometimes they would do this in front of a group. These could be completely innocent questions, but it forces you to lie (unless you want to be known as the wanker that buys reps).   If it was an authentic item, I wouldn't sweat it. But having people closely exam your new rep is a scary feeling.  tldr: You can get away with wearing reps if you don't have any friends."

If you're wearing shabby jeans, a faded tshirt, and driving an '87 Honda that is four different colors of primer, but you're wearing a Jaeger LeCoultre Master Tourbillon, anyone who knows what that watch is will know you're wearing a fake.

Even if you don't like a fuck nigga, act like you do, get their contacts, and ditch their ass. Shit, I'll be working with Ian Connor in a couple of months, my ass would not be doing that if I didn't network and learn how to act around people i aint like"
FashionReps,3942bh,Yung_Lee,2,Tue Jun 9 09:15:28 2015 UTC,"I don't get why so many people are so concerned with being called out. It seems so exhausting and not at all worth looking into reps at all if you're constantly worrying. Then to go so far as to lie and pretend it's authentic when questioned is a whole other level of bizarre to me.  I wear reps because I like the authentics a lot but cannot justify (or in some cases afford) the prices they charge. And I'm okay with admitting that.  If someone asks me how much I paid for it, or if it's real, I'm honest.  Then what? Someone makes fun of you for not spending 1100 dollars on jeans? Do you know how ridiculous that is? I fail to see how wearing a replica of an item that costs an exorbitant amount of money is any stupider than spending an exorbitant amount of money on that item to begin with. It's just a matter of perspective. They think you're a poser, you think they have more money than brains.  Think about the people you are stressing over and trying to impress, they really aren't worth it."

EDIT: My only complaint is the case of the Aviators, it's kind of thin material. I'm not sure if the normal Aviators case is thin but it isn't too big of a deal. The case of the Wayfarers is the same as my authentic."
FashionReps,393m0s,SFmale,3,Tue Jun 9 03:14:44 2015 UTC,I bought the Clubmasters off this seller and it had the branding on the arms. A complete disappointment considering how good their Wayfarers are.

FashionReps,393m0s,Foruncande,2,Wed Jun 10 14:56:27 2015 UTC,"They seem pretty sturdy, I was at an outlet mall yesterday and was checking out all the different authentic raybans and the aviators seemed to be just as durable.   I am more careful with them than my wayfarers because the thin frame seems more fragile but as long as you don't abuse them you'll be fine. For only like $12ea I'm ordering a few more pair plus some clubmasters.   EDIT: Also I've had my authentic wayfarers for about 4 years and I've stepped on them, sat on them, etc. Apparently a friend of mine even ran his over in his jeep while in the case and they were fine. (major fluke imo, I think mine would break if I ran them over lol)"

FashionReps,39122e,Senzoring,2,Mon Jun 8 13:53:12 2015 UTC,"Unhs hoodies are actually pretty on point. If the floating e bothers you then you'd want to make sure you get QC pictures before hand, but I've seen some near flawless. Stayfashion hoodies are UNHS and SMP, and you can use the side bar to decide which one you think would be better or worse... they both have flaws and advantages. I haven't personally ordered one, but most people say that blackjason7 has the best bogos. Of course he is on taobao so you would need an agent, and also make sure you get QC pics. You can also find them on aliexpress, but most will have atleast a few flaws.  Good luck!"
FashionReps,39122e,bathingwithapes,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:34:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Got a few pm's and I'll check theirs out. If not, I'll pull the trigger at UNHS."
FashionReps,39122e,bathingwithapes,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I bought a UNHS from ali, it's a cdg so I went ahead with ali since they all have a few flaws for the CDG. I'll be posting a review once I get it :) https://m.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/38qd6s/not_2014_supreme_x_cdg_hoodie_otw_will_be_posting/"
FashionReps,39122e,SmiteVale,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:33:19 2015 UTC,How would you get QC pics? Would you request the QC pics from the agent? Or try to send a message to blackjason himself?
FashionReps,39122e,bathingwithapes,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:24:41 2015 UTC,"You would ask the agent and the agent would ask jason. So basically the agent charges a fee, like a certain percentage of what you pay. You tell the agent you want to see pictures before he sends it to you, so he sends you pictures once he recieves them from the taobao seller (jason). If its not to your standards, you tell the agent to tell jason you want another, the agent keeps the fee for the original item (not much) sends it back to jason and he charges you a fee for the next item and the cycle continues until you get the one that you are happy with."

I was gonna get my prescription filled at a walk-in store, but since my prescription was kinda high (-7.00 and - 6.50 with astigmatism), I would need some high index lenses. I shopped around and was quoted around $120-180. But I found that [39dollarglasses.com](39dollarglasses.com) has a re-lensing service where you can send your frame and they'll put in lenses of your choice. Mine ended up being ~$90 for 1.67 index lenses. I mailed them on Friday 5/29, was delivered to their location in Hauppauge, NY on Monday 6/02, and they ""received"" them (put it in their system) on Friday 6/05 because they ""get at least two bags of frames""  for their re-lensing service a day. Depending on the lens choice (progressives and photochromics would take longer) , it would take 7-14 days for them to have the service done, shipped, and delivered to your door."

FashionReps,38qxsv,hashback,4,Sat Jun 6 02:23:58 2015 UTC,"Actually it has a couple flaws I bought one from my Mom and I must say it is nice but there are flaws. One the pattern is uneven, slightly but still. Secondly, there is not model tag to identity the manufacturing date. Thirdly, the sizing bands do not have indentations. Fourthly, the pattern only follows the end-start rule laterally and not longitudinally speaking. Which basically means when an icon get cut off, the other part of the pattern should begin on the other end.  Other than that it's a nice bag. My mom really enjoys it, I spent $180 for the bag and DHL express shipping."

Prices aren't all that great compared to buying it directly from china like you'd do online. Also the stuff they have is mostly low or the lowest quality. You pay a premium, but it's a fun experience to buy some reps on a street market. Remember you can drive prices really far down, haggling is part of the experience. And never buy something for the asking price."
FashionReps,38pqyl,jj_north,2,Fri Jun 5 22:07:48 2015 UTC,"Can I haggle in English? Also do I have to pay for stuff with cc or with their money? Shit this sounds fun lol, is there anything you would recommend buying?"
FashionReps,38pqyl,jjgoon,2,Fri Jun 5 22:09:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah the haggling comes down to throwing around numbers, you won't be really talking English, although most vendors will speak basic English.   For these situations you should pay cash, just get yourself some liras and you're set. Just make sure you don't take out too much cash, just remember that the locals will try to get as much money out of you as possible.   The last time I went to Turkey I got a few branded polos and shirts, nothing special really. Just get something that you like and to commemorate your trip."

Four days later get invoice.  Three days later get item.  Wrong belt buckle - and although the belt quality looks okay, the buckle itself isn't authentic looking.  It's too big and gaudy.

FashionReps,38dzia,Alimoose,6,Wed Jun 3 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"Ordered it from Yourcartier.com for $95 and free shipping Shipping took a little over two weeks. It was ordered on May 19th and arrived today, June 3rd. Quality is excellent. The bracelet has some weight to it and comparing the actual bracelet to the rep, I don't see any differences at all. The gift bag and dust bag seem fine as well, but the certificate and box are clearly not that great. I believe the box is an older model box and the certificate came a bit bent at the top left corner. I don't know the exact sizing of the real certificates, but the certificate that came with my rep is fairly small and doesn't feel like it is great quality.  I've never actually seen one of these bracelets in person. I'm just going by images of the authentic ones on Google and eBay and other forums, and it seems to be a 1:1 replica. Again, I'm no expert and haven't seen one of these in person, so please let me know if there are any flaws that you see on the bracelet itself, compared to the authentic. I never dealt with customer service but they had automated e-mails that kept me up to date with every single step in the process of shipping my bracelet (payment confirmed, order processed, packed and ready to ship, shipped).   Please feel free to post any comments, questions or concerns. Hope I was able to help you guys. Thanks!"

FashionReps,38dzia,throwaway-af,6,Sat Jun 6 17:58:31 2015 UTC,"Bracelet looks great. You used to be able to get these for $20-25, but it looks like most sellers at that price point are bait-and-switching now that cheaper reps of the post-2011 version are out. Screws are popping out a little just like they're supposed to.  The box is an older version. I don't know how old, but the real ones have come lined with white satin for quite some time now, and are square with the holder for the screwdriver at the bottom/front rather than on the side. Doesn't matter, most people don't know.  The bag is crap, same one David sends out. Lettering is too thick, with ropes that don't go through the sides of the bag and end in shoelace aglets. The texture of the bag is closer than some places, but has way too much lamination. Dust bag is the worst I've ever seen, with terrible lettering that looks like someone with a glitter pen attempting to freehand the logo, and it looks like felt rather than velvet.  The certificate is the worst part. The fonts and spacing are off on every English part except the word ""CERTIFICATE."" The language is Japanese, but the stamp is from Paris, so it should be French. The stamp is also for the non-existent Cartier Frenchship Store, which I assume comes from friendship stores, which are something that's popular in China but not elsewhere. The paper and everything looks fine compared to the real deal (minus the fact that there's no ID number or signature, which you could easily fix yourself), but the details are all fucked.  All that said, you're wearing the bracelet, not the packaging or accessories, and the bracelet looks real fuckin good."
FashionReps,38dzia,swaggyd007,2,Wed Jun 3 19:57:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't care much for the accessories. I just didn't know where to find a similar quality bracelet by itself. Thanks for the feedback!"

I message him ""oh i didn't have that buckle in stock""   So you weren't going to tell me?  I don't plan on paying a dime more on shipping either as it's not my mistake...

FashionReps,388oux,aree93,2,Wed Jun 3 22:04:47 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest, even the best Balmain(jeans) reps are bad. Out of all the reps I've seen only TWO pair of jeans look somewhat identical to the authentic.   The first one is http://www.bhiner.com/taobao-agent/42845962216 . They look good and you can't really go wrong unless someone specifically wants to touch the fabric to get a feel of the wax.  The second one is http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Medium-Washing-Balm-in-Jeans-2015-New-Arrival-Pleated-Motorcycle-Denim-Pants-Men/32293776506.html . They look almost identical but the stitching and colour of the threads are completely wrong. The colour of the pair is also too ""washed"" on the replica compared to the authentic.   I have one other pair of replica Balmain but they were my first pair and look really bad so won't even bother going into detail over those. (http://cdn.iofferphoto.com/img3/item/589/044/727/o_balmain-men-s-blue-casual-paint-point-fold-jeans-d502.jpg)  What I'm trying to say is that it's really easy to tell when you see a pair of replicas.

Here's a couple of pictures of the authentic then the replica ones. http://imgur.com/a/cdsWX   First there's the threads, they're gold/gray. The authentics have a clear yellow stitching which makes the pair not look simply ""blue"", if you understand.  Then there's unnecessary washing lines on the back, both on the butt and on the lower part of the leg. (Picture 6)  Hope this helps, if not PM me."

FashionReps,387zm4,Dirtynarkotics,2,Tue Jun 2 14:51:15 2015 UTC,99% of people seeing him in this shirt will have no idea what it even is.  And the people who do know about the shirts aren't going to know all the fine details.  And if someone comes up to you and mentions something so what?
FashionReps,387zm4,BrawnWithBrain,2,Tue Jun 2 19:31:57 2015 UTC,Exactly what I'm saying. I could go on for days w how much the sneaker rep community stresses tiny details but it's not worth kt

So Small fits tight on me while medium is a bit big. This jacket fitted a bit big on me. So i'd say, if you want it to be tight on you go TTS and if you want it a bit big go size up. I recommend going a size up."
