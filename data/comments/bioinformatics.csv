bioinformatics,3e4bdr,morphinemachine,5,Tue Jul 21 23:16:21 2015 UTC,"That's fair.  I'm aware most all start ups are super labour intensive and maybe by using the word I inspired an image of a grandiose organization. As a company we're looking to hit a niche market and I don't envision the informatics part to be a ridiculous amount of work.  We're not large or even off the ground yet. It's currently a small team doing part time work after our day jobs. Team currently consists of me (Genetic Technologist, MSc Biotechnology and Genomics), PhD Physicist/Mathematician and an MBA Business student.  I think, conceptually, it could be a nice supplemental income with very little work. I don't envision this to be the uber of bioinformatics or anything crazy."
bioinformatics,3e4bdr,morphinemachine,4,Tue Jul 21 23:30:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a little skeptical -- the company may not have grandiose plans, but if you plan on being a startup in the sense that I understand the term (i.e. you're going to try to get funding from VCs and such), I think starting any company, no matter how small, requires a lot of time and effort from everyone on the team to have any sort of success or to be anything more than a hobby.

bioinformatics,3e4bdr,biocomputer,4,Wed Jul 22 02:29:00 2015 UTC,Do you have customers lined up? Are there even that many people still doing microarrays?
bioinformatics,3e4bdr,CountOneInterrupt,4,Wed Jul 22 00:08:10 2015 UTC,"I think they're still often used for diagnostic purposes because you're screening the same panel of genes, snps, whatever, over and over and over for each new patient.

It's a Direct to consumer company so having no customers at this point in time isn't weird.   I currently work in clinical genetics and yes, microarrays are super popular right now. Often there isn't need for all the excessive data that NGS platforms give, most arrays are very targeted.   We're actually only going to be looking at 20 SNP's to determine a genetic risk score for a certain trait, but having a background in microarray/NGS data would be super helpful, as that's where most of the source data comes from."

bioinformatics,3e4bx1,niemasd,6,Tue Jul 21 21:19:30 2015 UTC,For DESeq2 this is actually a pretty complicated procedure. For a highly expressed and well behaved gene (variance is proportional to expression) you basically get the mean fold change between the groups of replicates. For other genes there are all sorts of modifications to that value to make it more useful for ranking genes.
bioinformatics,3e4bx1,drnknmstrr,3,Tue Jul 21 23:09:10 2015 UTC,"Regarding further information, the respective papers (and/or documentation) probably are a good start. But the short version is that the 'measured' expression level for a sample merely based on read counts is biased in several ways, the most obvious being read depth, so you can in principle correct these (for each sample individually) and then compare the expression levels, but this is still suboptimal, because taking the information from the different samples and different groups can help estimate the true expression values much better. So what several tools do (I think DESeq2, I don't know about CuffDiff) is actually model all gene expression levels as Possion or negative binomial distributions at the same time including all the possible influences, and the log fold-change between those values is what is then reported."

Due to the relative lack of biologists with quantitative/programming skills, rightly or wrongly, many open positions ask for these skills (which you have in abundance) in detriment of in-depth knowledge of biological problem. Since you have a biological sciences background, it should be easy to pick up at least some basic concepts. Actually, from the summary of your research experience:   PhD in systems neuroscience computational biology master's degree graph theory for studying brain connectivity    I would say you already doing bioinformatics. It's a broad church.   I've been thinking about maybe doing a placement in a more traditional biology/computational biology lab before I graduate - how much of a difference would this make? (it would likely be for 1-3 months, depending on permission from my PI).    It could certainly help you decide what exactly do you want to do and if you like it. Actually, reading over your post, it is not clear to me what is exactly that you want to do? Sequence analysis, protein interactions, image mining, in silico evolution, development of NGS mapping tools, just play with biological data (and what type), etc, are all ""bioinformatics"".   Edit: just to clarify, you have the skills to go to an academic lab (or a facility) and start working on most stuff as in-house data analyst. However this will not give you much freedom to chose projects. If you want to run your own project, you better have at least a broad biological/technical topic of interest.

I have a BS in Biomedical Engineering, but my University program did not include a lot of biostatistics or genetics, which is something I've definitely had to learn and play catch up with; I think the biggest thing I brought to the table (and why I was hired) was that I was involved in Cancer research in school, and I DID study a lot of Pharmacokinetics, which is huge in precision medicine (especially with cancer).  I think this is the field to get involved in, especially with the new reimbursement structuring for genetic tests, which are going to make medical insurance companies way more willing to cover genetic testing, and so there will be a huge increase in the number of genetic tests performed in the US.   The work is hugely rewarding and interesting; I have learned more in the last 6 months than I probably internalized during two years of college classes. And being able to apply that knowledge to improve analytic practices, and make sure the kid who is suffering AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) gets the critical drug he needs in a matter of days now rather than weeks?

I can't give you too much advice heading into grad school (I will be trying to return to school to get a masters in Bioinformatics myself within the next year or so -- there's just so much to learn!) but I can say that even my colleagues who have PhDs in the field still are reading papers and learning about the technologies on a daily basis. Read everything you can get your hands on. Assuming you are still in Undergrad, use the school library to get access to journals and pick up some articles.

bioinformatics,3dui23,moodee,8,Sun Jul 19 16:33:39 2015 UTC,"I did this!  Started my Ph.D with only wet-lab experience.  I'd not done anything on a computer besides basic Google-fu for troubleshooting personal issues, and I didn't even know how to get to the command line, much less run anything from it.  I showed up at grad school and couldn't find a first rotation slot.  I went to our bioinformatics-based lab and said, ""Hi.  You interviewed me, so I remember you, and I need a rotation slot for my first rotation.""  ""I don't know any bioinformatics or computer stuff.  I don't really even like bioinformatics.  I'm not going to join your lab.  I just need something to do for my first month or so of school.""  The professor said I was more than welcome, handed me a book, and told me to learn Unix and Perl.  I actually enjoyed the rotation - and for the next few rotations after that, back in wet lab world, I kept on comparing things to bioinformatics.  By the end of my third rotation, I realized that I had to crawl back to that professor, my hat in my hand, and beg for him to let me join after all.  He happily agreed, and now I'm building computational bioinformatics tools!  So it's definitely possible.  If you want to make the transition easier:   Start learning more about how the tools you use work.  You likely won't get to pick your own area to focus on right away, but knowing which area of bioinformatics you want to move into will help.  There's a lot more freedom in bioinformatics, I feel. Learn some code!!  At the very least, learn to move around in a Unix system with the command line.  Consider buying a Mac. Pick up either some basic Perl or Python.  Codecademy has a great free course that can teach you Python basics. Talk to bioinformatics professors in grad school!  Having a connection makes joining the lab much easier, especially if you don't have a lot of background experience. During grad school, you'll also take some courses.  Plan on throwing in a stats or CS course to help balance out your shortcomings.   It's definitely possible to switch from a wet-lab background to bioinformatics.  Similarly, lots of CS people who look at bioinformatics need to make up for their lack of background in biology.  It just takes a little work."
bioinformatics,3dui23,Romanticon,3,Sun Jul 19 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"That's great news! I definitely plan to get more aquatinted with my tools.

I'm actually already for comfortable with Unix, and have a bit of coding experience (small things like building pipelines with Python glue)  I think my biggest concern is the theory side of the math/stats and CS, how have you found picking those things up? I've never taken linear algebra and my calf background was very mechanical, I'm afraid those will limit me from making real contributions."
bioinformatics,3dui23,jjberg2,2,Sun Jul 19 21:28:42 2015 UTC,"I think my biggest concern is the theory side of the math/stats and CS, how have you found picking those things up?    So I came from a wet lab background and transitioned to doing theoretical and statistical genetics in my PhD (as did a number of folks in my lab).   When I started grad school the last math classes I had taken were some courses in multivariate calc and linear algebra during my freshman year of college, and I had exactly one semester of statistics. Now this is basically what I do, and I pretty much had to relearn it all in grad school.   I'd advise that you plan to take a few math/stats courses as part of your graduate curriculum, but don't expect this to patch up all your holes. Expect to spend a chunk of time reading on your own (I spent a lot of time reading math/stats/theory papers from my particular sub-discipline), and don't expect it all to sink in right away. I probably struggled with feeling left behind/out of my depth a fair amount my first year and a half or so, but now at four years in I rarely feel that way, and when I do it's because I've deliberately chosen to read something that I know is beyond my current reach.  It's a bit like drinking out of a firehose at first, but as long as you believe you have a mind for the math (e.g. you did well/enjoyed math in high school), even if you don't think you're a brilliant mathematician (I'm certainly not), you'll be fine. That's the nice thing about math and stats in biology. You don't have to be especially skilled in the way a true mathematician or statistician would be. You just have to get yourself a solid and well-rounded understanding and then learn how to apply the math/stats you do known the biology problems you find interesting."
bioinformatics,3dui23,Romanticon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:11:13 2015 UTC,"Hehe.  I confess that the last stats course I took was in high school, and my CS background has been largely self-taught.  Perhaps not the best thing to declare on the bioinformatics sub...  I think it depends a lot on the area of bioinformatics you focus on - and the lab you join.  My lab is super helpful, friendly, and collaborative.  Indeed, even my PI doesn't have a stats background, but she works with another professor who does, and he's more than happy to offer up his expertise.  Similarly, my work is more on the area of building new tools by combining existing parts than it is on some of the mathematical know-how behind how those tools were constructed.  I do a lot of reading when I need to understand a math concept, but my personal work doesn't require as much stats and pure math as I feared going in.  Again, as I mentioned before, you can always look at taking a stats or math-based course in the first year or two of grad school - it's a little extra work, but it will give you a lot better foundation for moving forward into computational bioinformatics areas."

bioinformatics,3dui23,evolgen,2,Wed Jul 22 09:32:54 2015 UTC,"My transition was more difficult than yours, but it worked out eventually.  I did a BSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics with only 4 CS courses, targeted to biologists. For my final year project, I did a pure bioinformatics project, aiming to transition to in silico stuff.   Then, I went and did an MRes in Computational Ecology/Evolution stuff, which was quite the big jump for me, as I had never heard of terms such as carrying capacity or resilience. I'm soon starting a PhD on more of that stuff, hoping to include some bioinformatics side-projects in it.  I've written all that to tell you that if you spend enough time seeing what's out there and filling any gaps that you find, nothing can prevent you from forging your own dream path."

The main reason I did it was to expand my background of molecular biology and get a feeling of what whole organism biology and ecology is, in a computational manner.  Also, I wanted to increase my chances for an interdisciplinary PhD, combining mini-projects with genes and physiology, all the way to evolution and ecology. Now, this won't be so much the case for your PhD, as you don't want to jump to a whole new field.  Learning how to program in a language such as Perl, R or Python would be my first step if I were you. It doesn't matter which one you choose that much, as further down the road, you'll probably find useful to know at least some bits of all three of them.

When I was in high school, I wanted to get into software development. So I picked up Java. I played with Scheme, C, Python, etc, but Java was my clear forte. I then switched from software to something called BioMolecular Engineering. So I have a BS in that field. Combo of Mol. Bio, Chem Eng, Bioinformatics, Math, Chemistry, etc.   I was set up for working at the bench once I got my BS in 2013 since I disliked chemical engineering. So I devoted myself to improving my software and bioinformatics experience. I ended up working 2 part-time jobs in bioinformatics and an internship in bioinformatics and software development through Google Summer of Code, along with finishing a year of a master's in bioinformatics.

Plus, I wanted to get a job more quickly, partially because I was tired of having a engineering degree and failing to find any employment. So I just went with a master's in my city.   Regarding my glut of part-time jobs, I was lucky (or cursed because I moved around so much).  First,I made a connection with a local bioinformatics professor my senior year of college. I worked in her lab full-time for about 2 months with about 4 months of part-time work preceding that. I just did low-level coding work in Java, CSS/HTML, etc.  Barring some irregular 16S rRNA job I worked as a contractor from October 2013 to Februrary 2015, I didn't have any luck finding decent money/work until April 2014, when I got into Google Summer of Code 2014 working with JSBML. Good experience, I recommend it to anyone who has nothing planned over their summers and are on the younger side.  After Google finished and my master's started, I got a part-time job at another university a few miles away doing exome analysis (knowing the very basics of RNA-Seq and Linux, dunno how I was chosen :P) I heard about this job through the bioinformatics department.

Sometimes groups/labs are full or don't have funding and you'll need to find an alternate. Start introducing yourself, repeat what you've said here, and see what the professors think.

bioinformatics,3dfnpc,Melliferan,4,Wed Jul 15 22:11:18 2015 UTC,"If its a highly conserved gene, you are in luck. If you have the coding sequence (CDS) of this gene for one member of the family/families you are looking for you can do:  1) If you have a gene name (i.e. Major outer membrane protein, ompA) then you can enter this name into NCBI ""gene"" database and it should pull up all the sequences annotated with that name. If it's annotated with a different name though - then this method won't pull it up.   2) You can cut and paste the nucleotide sequence into NCBI ""BLAST"" and search using MEGABLAST (for highly conserved sequences) or discontiguous BLAST or BLASTn for highly discontiguous/distant matches. You can also do this with the translated protein sequence (using the protein search in BLAST) and back-translate to DNA. This should pull up results for everything even remotely similar/related to your gene and some results that are in no way related... this is good if your gene is annotated by different names in different species.   3) If you have an idea what processes the gene is involved in (i.e. flagellar assembly, nucleotide synthesis etc) you can jump on KEGG pathway (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) and click through to find sequences and all sorts of information through there."

Having read through the TopHat documentation I now know that there are an almost infinite set of ways in which the program could be run, but this doesn't necessarily help me work out which is best for my particular circumstances. This is an area where tools could improve, i.e. rather than listing all the parameters, list recipes for different usage scenarios.  Ultimately, you may have to choose a bunch of different parameter combinations to try on a small test data set and hope that you learn something useful from them."

bioinformatics,3d4rlj,shellsgotclass,3,Tue Jul 14 19:07:28 2015 UTC,"The bioinformatics community seems to produce a lot of computer programs that are more-or-less thin wrappers around algorithms.  Perhaps there is something inherently versatile and abstract about this kind of software that dooms us to the risks described in the OP's blog entry.  If we want to get beyond this, it will probably happen when we develop sophisticated software that is oriented around vertical markets. Software of that kind will be easier to understand and apply correctly."
bioinformatics,3d4rlj,BrianCalves,3,Tue Jul 14 01:44:46 2015 UTC,"This is also a good reminder to avoid filling your software with arbitrary ""magic numbers"", even if you make them theoretically tunable as default parameters that the users can change."
bioinformatics,3d4rlj,Epistaxis,2,Mon Jul 13 22:40:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, but for the sake of discussion, what do you recommend, instead?  We could refrain from supplying default values, and require the user to enter every value explicitly. Some might argue that that exonerates the author of the software from any whiff of liability. However, it is easy to imagine every confused user plugging in arbitrary values they read somewhere on the Internet, with the same result as if the software had supplied a default value.  I expect that sort of thing happens a lot, presently, with those computer programs that require configuration files to be supplied at each invocation of the program. The user often copies the configuration file from someone else with as little understanding as if the program had supplied a default value?  Do you have an approach that you prefer?"
bioinformatics,3d4rlj,BrianCalves,2,Tue Jul 14 02:10:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, but for the sake of discussion, what do you recommend, instead?   Don't write code that requires ""variable constants"". Write code that inspects its environment and inputs and determines what constants are appropriate, with optional overrides where that's appropriate.  For instance - don't ask the user for the number of threads to use and default to 2; default to the number of cores where you're running, with an option for the user to specify more or less than that (there are applications where you might want to bottleneck threads so your IO can keep up, for instance.)  Users should be able to rely on your defaults to mostly do the right thing, because the user is going to know a lot less about your software than you do. Your defaults are the most defensible choice of parameters in most cases, or should be. Putting all that on the end user is an abdication of programmer responsibility, and indicative of the relatively low quality of development in a lot of bioinformatics applications."
bioinformatics,3d4rlj,crashfrog,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:19:46 2015 UTC,"I like the approach you suggest. Though I've found it difficult to follow, or to involve dire trade offs.  For example, it might be necessary to scan an entire data set, or (re-)perform calculations repeatedly, in order to apply heuristics that choose parameter values. That could increase program runtime by 2x, 10x, 100x, or more. Although, it can be useful to have that kind of robust capability, from time to time.  In fact, we might expect authors to perform exactly this kind of analysis before drawing conclusions or publishing. Although I'm not sure this kind of research/analysis is often performed. ;-)  It used to be, and sometimes still is, difficult to detect available processors/cores, physical memory, virtual memory, where-and-how-much scratch disk space is available; depending on what programming languages you're using, and how many operating systems you support. And the resources available might suggest radically different computational strategies.  Still, I'm glad you suggested this approach. You remind all of us to apply it more often, or, at least, to aspire!"
bioinformatics,3d4rlj,BrianCalves,2,Tue Jul 14 18:55:26 2015 UTC,"If I have cynical hat on, I'd say that sometimes leaving command-line set parameters is a quick and easy way of getting around a comment/complaint from a reviewer. Instead of having to decide and then subsequently demonstrate and justify in a paper what an optimal or default parameter should be, it is left to the user to make that determination with only a best guess left by the script author. This can provide flexibility, but only if you know what you're doing.  Edit. I am not suggesting to do this, but that it is something to be aware of."
bioinformatics,3d4rlj,andypandypidillypoo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:52:22 2015 UTC,"I think this ties into a broader problem: understanding the models used from reading the paper is usually hard.  Before you get get the pitchforks - while someone that has been active in the field of the paper for some years might have a considerably easier time understanding, we need to ask ourselfs if we want to really only write for that audience exclusively. After all, isn't it the case for most groups that coding gets off loaded onto students?   And more broadly, what about other groups of people that may want your research to be more accessible? I'm primarily thinking journalism here, but also why shouldn't, for example, high school students be able to understand, and maybe even to some degree replicate, your research?  Now it's pretty obvious that the style of writing of papers isn't going to change anytime soon, and neither is the publishing industry. My vision is that, ideally, every time you publish a paper you also publish a blog entry that describes your paper on a more abstract level.  The opportunities that modern web technologies offer here are pretty fantastic in my opinion. Interactive visualizations like this will only get easier to use. Tailoring text to the individual that reads it is actually possible, even if the frameworks to do so may not exist in the extend that they have reason to. The option to allow anonymous commenting could also encourage a more open discussion."

bioinformatics,3d6nzj,AwesomeeExpress,5,Mon Jul 13 23:04:07 2015 UTC,"Careers rarely go the way we expect.  They are long winding adventures that span decades, and often take us to unexpected places.    Overall, you're not asking the wrong questions, but your ""options"" are far from limited to what you've listed.  As u/niemasd has pointed out, PhDs in bioinformatics are generally a good way to go.  It means 5 years instead of 2-3 years, but usually you receive a reasonable (if meager) salary.  But, a PhD does two things for you: it raises the salary cap and opens doors to leading groups or teams.  The danger of a PhD is that you have to find a lab that challenges you (without killing you) and to know what skill sets will be in demand when you get out, and then bust your ass to make sure you're damned good at them.    One of the many differences between a masters and a PhD is in who does the selection of skills.  In a masters degree, you spend your time doing what other people tell you.  In a PhD, you are in charge of your own destiny, and the only person you can blame afterwards, for anything or everything, is going to be yourself.  Risk and reward are proportional.  Landing a job is a good option, but competition is fierce for good jobs in bioinformatics, depending on where you are.  You have to ask if you really are the best candidate for a specific job, and if that's the job you want.  You'll be competing with biologists and engineers and computer scientists, so consider how you'll stack up.  Also, nothing wrong with the status quo.  By all means, if you're still learning a lot from your current job, then maybe it's not time to leave yet.  The advice I usually give to people in your situation is this:  Find your dream job, then decide how you're going to get there.  If you try to plan your career without knowing where it's going to take you, how good do you really think your plan is going to turn out?  Regardless, good luck with the hard decisions ahead."
bioinformatics,3d6nzj,apfejes,2,Tue Jul 14 02:49:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback!  So the major thing for me that led me away from a PHD in the first place (from going into a Immunology PHD that I originally planned to do) is that in the end the life style didn't appeal to me. As I have gotten older and now have a family, being able to support them but also have time for my own interests as well is important to me.   I enjoy working with data, and its a skill set I have always enjoyed utilizing but never focused on because of my previous interest/goals. I have looked at bioinformatics/statistics/software engineering jobs that have been posted at companies/agencies in my area and the work consists of what I currently enjoy doing (albeit at a more professional level) mixed with stuff I know I am capable of but just don't have experience with yet.   When looking at these positions, not many of them required PHD's and my thoughts were that my path to get there is either to keep working/building experience until I can land a job somewhere or just commit to getting a master and risk doing it out of pocket in hopes that I can land a job. I know PHD is another route but out side of that I am not sure what my options are."
bioinformatics,3d6nzj,apfejes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:40:47 2015 UTC,"I totally get it - it is VERY difficult to go back to school when you have a family, both financially and in terms of time commitment.    Actually, if you were thinking of doing a Masters, I'd seriously consider doing it somewhere that would allow you to transfer to a PhD, if you wanted to.  Effectively, that allows you to get in with a 2 year plan, and extend it to a PhD, if you discover that it has some merit.  If not, you can always leave after the Masters and not look back.  At least, in Canada, students who enter into programs like that are generally paid for the masters, which should make it easier.  In the states, I'm less familiar with the fee structure for the MSc programs.  Unfortunately, bioinformatics is unlike most tech fields, and there really is an academic heirarchy - the work force is mostly composed of programming biologists who expect the biology career ladder to be imposed on the engineers and programmers, but I suspect you know that already.  Even in industry, there are strong influences of that.  Finding a BSc leading a team of PhDs is practically unheard of.    Anyhow, it sounds like you know what you want, and have a good idea what you're willing to do to get there.. so you're probably not far from making a decision.  Your idea of building experience is probably good - that's how everyone develops their career, if they have aspirations.  The question is always how you build that experience quickly in order to position yourself for the next good experience. (-:  P.S. You put your age as 27 - in bioinformatics, most of the people I know have incredibly long career trajectories - I didn't finish my PhD till I was 34, though I took a few years to do the start-up thing and have both a masters and a PhD. Life happens... I spent far too long worrying about how old I was compared to my peers.  In the end, it doesn't matter, and really isn't losing sleep over.  (Though, it was good motivation to get my PhD done quickly!)"
bioinformatics,3d6nzj,niemasd,3,Tue Jul 14 15:49:34 2015 UTC,"You mentioned getting a masters in bioinformatics/statistics/CS, but one possible option is to apply for PhD instead since many Bioinformatics (and hard sciences in general) PhD programs offer tuition waivers with stipends, whereas most MS programs have you pay completely out of pocket, so PhD may even be cheaper than MS. It's more time, but you'll have higher opportunities in the end and you'll probably save money as far as the actual degree goes"
bioinformatics,3d6nzj,HOBrFINCl,2,Tue Jul 14 01:32:36 2015 UTC,"I think it depends where you are! In some countries it might be faster to get a Master's, and may be all you need for a job.

bioinformatics,3d6nzj,hervold,2,Tue Jul 14 13:42:23 2015 UTC,Thanks! I have considered a PHD but I turned away from that route (as I was originally planning on an immunology PHD) as I have a family now and I can't see myself making less than I make now for 5 years when most of the masters programs in my area are only 1.5 years and cost differential should pay for itself with the increased earnings as long as I can actually find a job.

The short answer is that you would 1) transfer your data to storage attached to the HPC cluster (typically ftp/sftp/gridftp/aspera).  2) run cluster commands against said data.  3) download or display the results on your local workstation.  Before you do anything, if there is a wiki page, a users manual a regular WebEx etc for new cluster users, watch/read/review it thoroughly.  All HPC systems are different.  You need at least a basic knowledge of what sort of scheduler (SGE/UNIVA? Torque? Virtualized?) they are running and how to interact with it, available queues, and the library of HPC-enabled software and algorithms and how to load them (directly? Via modules?).  We have a bioinformatics HPC core.  I cannot tell you how many times we had new users who completely jacked up the system until we developed a compulsory intro session for all new users."

bioinformatics,3cyn2z,Quietstorm685,5,Sat Jul 11 23:38:55 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not so much ""convert"", since the files aren't interchangable.  BAM is simply a file that contains the aligned read fragments.  It contains the aligner's best guess as to the origin of each fragment.  In contrast, MAF is what you get after you call variants (eg, the places where the fragments indicate that the person/thing you sequenced differed from the reference genome) and take the time to annotate them to indicate what the effect is.  The TCGA hosts the specification for the Mutation Annotation Format (https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/Mutation+Annotation+Format+%28MAF%29+Specification) , and there's a good page on biostars (https://www.biostars.org/p/69222/) that seems to have a lot of useful information on it.  I have to admit, though, I don't actually know what software converts a snp call to MAF, or rather, provides the annotation.  Hopefully someone else can follow along and fill in that gap."
bioinformatics,3cyn2z,apfejes,2,Sun Jul 12 02:52:34 2015 UTC,"?? MAF is another alignment format .. are you thinking of VCF?  Both lastz and last output MAF, and both may have some utilities to convert MAF to SAM (then SAMTools to BAM).  Edit: TIL MAF is also a variant call format! nvm..."

bioinformatics,3ct8yx,eskal,3,Fri Jul 10 16:17:24 2015 UTC,"Just give each 16 threads (assuming each core has two threads). That makes a lot more sense than some odd number like 20(16 is a power of 2).   Also, don't forget about the bottleneck of four bwa processes writing to disk concurrenty."
bioinformatics,3ct8yx,EthidiumIodide,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"as far as CPU bottlenecking goes, would I be correct in guessing that running with 20 threads each when there are only 32 cores will not make them slower? As it is, it seems like they've settled on giving each main bwa instance  8 full cores' worth of CPU time regardless of the number of sub-processes/threads. In terms of CPU time needed, it should work out the same either way as long as all cores are in use, right?"
bioinformatics,3ct8yx,TheLordB,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"My suggestion would be install a monitoring tool like ganglia if you haven't already.  Generally what I do is quite literally watch ganglia and whatever goes over the limits or make it turn red I reduce (red means something is being overused).  It might be a bit overkill for a single server as ganglia is mainly designed for clusters, but I do think it would be useful.  Generally I try to go about 10% under the limits.  So if I have 20CPU I try to do 18 in use, 100GB ram use 90GB, etc.  If you see anything spiking in ganglia that is generally bad.  That said I really don't know how much in ganglia needs to be configured to give me the nice graph that anything spiking above it's charts is bad.  It is nice to have sysadmins (especially ones that can be bribed with beer).  I think most of it comes with the default install though the default install is a bit of a pain."

That'll tell you which one is faster."
bioinformatics,3cqjfy,ParaFilmIt,4,Thu Jul 9 23:42:09 2015 UTC,"The Pythonpath is a list of directories that the Python interpreter will look in to find modules when you invoke ""import my_module"". But I don't think BLAST+ is a Python module, I think it's a compiled executable. So you can't import it into a Python script.  What you can do is use Python's subprocess module to call out to the shell and collect the input. subprocess.check_output is the relevant function. Basically, you want to give it two parameters, the first being the string you want it to try to run:  output = subprocess.check_output(""blast+ --some-opts /path/to/a/fasta/or/whatever"", shell=True)  (shell = True means that it calls out inside of a login shell, which gives you access your PATH envvars, which is more like what you're used to in the Terminal.)  output will then contain the stdout output of running the tool, which is probably what you want to parse. (If I remember BLAST correctly, because I wrote something like this, it's a human-readable alignment report unless you specify one of BLAST's table/xml output formats.)"
bioinformatics,3cqjfy,crashfrog,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:46:38 2015 UTC,I'm a bit confused by this. I was reading this post using BLAST+ and I got the error as flitrfli in the comments and saw this posted as a solution:  That error message is indicating that the blastp command is not found. You need to ensure that it is installed and that it is in your $PATH.
bioinformatics,3cqjfy,crashfrog,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:23:45 2015 UTC,Is this basically what you're suggesting? To use the subprocess module to add BLAST+ to my path?
bioinformatics,3cqjfy,KeScoBo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:24:46 2015 UTC,"The shell (bash, in your case) isn't just an environment for working with folders and files and programs, it's also the interpreter of a programming language called ""bash"". Like most programming languages it has variables you can declare. There are certain variables that get set automatically for you, on login, to set up a workable environment for your convenience; these are called ""environment variables."" PATH is an environment variable (""envvar"") that your shell references to find command-line programs. (Like certain other languages, including Perl, Bash requires that you explicitly ask it to evaluate the contents of the variable as opposed to the variable pointer itself, which you do via the dereference operator prefix '$'; hence it is common, but technically incorrect, for people to refer to environment variable names with that prefix, as your quoted material does - '$PATH'. Python, on the other hand, has implicit variable substitution which is why you've probably never heard the term 'dereference operator.')  For instance, if you type ls -lah, to see the contents of your current directory and their metadata, then bash looks in the colon-delimited list of paths in your PATH environment variable, and looks inside each path for an executable called 'ls'. Usually it'll find that program where it lives: /bin/ls, typically. It then executes that program, passing the string '-lah' as the contents of the ""argument vector"" or argv.  If you've ever installed a command line tool, or thought you did, and then went to use it, and the shell spits back:  my_tool: not found  it's because nothing with the execute bit was found in any of the directories in your PATH called 'my_tool'. This is the problem your quoted solution was trying to solve, and as described, it's different than the problem you have, which is that (I think?) you're trying to import into Python something that isn't a Python module. You said that you were able to call BLAST from the command line, which is a different problem than what is going on in the Biostars thread.  Post the error you're getting and I'll see if I can help. BioPython's interface over BLAST is notoriously shitty, though, and I've never seen an application that isn't better solved by just calling out to the shell directly, using subprocess."
bioinformatics,3cqjfy,crashfrog,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:53:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the detailed post. Seems like a lot of misnomers being thrown around that complicate the picture. What do you recommend someone new to programming do to learn the true fundamentals? Right now I feel so dependent on forums and I feel like I do things without truly understanding what's going on. Not a good foundation to build upon.   As far as the BLAST+ problem, I followed the instructions here and have been able to use the BLAST+ ""Blast2Sequences"" for my project."
bioinformatics,3cqjfy,crashfrog,3,Fri Jul 10 02:32:42 2015 UTC,"I've been in a similar boat for most of the past year. What I've found to be helpful is to not use anything until you understand at least ~60% of what it's doing. It's not worth it to wait until you're 100% clear, because you'll traverse endless rabbit holes, but if you take the time to actually puzzle out at least a little bit of every problem, the knowledge starts to accumulate.  And keep doing what you're doing - build tools you'll actually use and ask questions. Stackoverflow has been really great to me, but I always make sure to Google and read and Google and read a bunch before I ask a question, and then I mention in my question what I've read and what's still confusing."

If you have genomic data etc. you might want to look into the visualization packages in bioconductor (I forgot how they are called), but there was at least one good one, I think it was called Gviz or so."

However, ggbio does some things that are not possible in Gviz (Karyograms came to mind), and the underlying plots are ggplot2, so one can thinker more freely.  Ultimately it very much depends on what type of data the OP has. I would hazard a guess that ggplot2 will suffice for most of his needs. Getting the data into shape as an R beginner is a pain though."
bioinformatics,3cp3uw,mentafresca,4,Thu Jul 9 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"Uh... No?  The sequences you get from the RNA-Seq are going to be fragments of the transcripts.

bioinformatics,3cp3uw,calibos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:37:32 2015 UTC,"What?  De novo assembly is building transcripts without using a reference genome.  Mapping the reads to a reference genome, calling variants, and rebuilding the transcripts is very possible.  I've even done it by mapping reads to a related species' WGS when I didn't have the correct reference available.  As far as OP's question goes, I did it using samtools' mpileup command."
bioinformatics,3cp3uw,apfejes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:43:08 2015 UTC,"That isn't what OP asked.  He wanted to know if he could use the sequenced fragments to obtain the full length transcripts without doing de novo assembly.  The answer is no.   He can do many other things, including aligning to a reference genome and doing variant calling, and then making assumptions about the original transcripts, but if he wishes to do what he actually asked about, then assembly is the only way to do it."
bioinformatics,3cp3uw,calibos,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:56:14 2015 UTC,"I don't really see a meaningful distinction here, but maybe we're interpreting what OP actually needs differently   There are only 2 issues that I see with this approach.  First, low/no coverage regions obviously don't have high quality base calls for his individual so he would need to determine whether to fill in with the reference sequence or mark it as unknown.  Since he didn't actually specify that he needed full length transcripts or all full length transcripts, I don't know whether OP cares.  Second, structural variations wouldn't be detected, but most people aren't looking for SVs, and those who are generally have a vague idea how to find them.  Since OP didn't mention them specifically I doubt those are what he is interested in identifying."
bioinformatics,3cp3uw,apfejes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"It's semantics.  I was answering what he asked. You're answering what else he can do.

bioinformatics,3cp3uw,Darigandevil,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:34:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can easily view variants in a genome browser. however, because the reads are too short, it will not be easy to phase them.  Get your bam files from your alignments (e.g. accepted_hits.bam from Tophat / Bowtie), index them with samtools, then open it with a genome browser like IGV. You can see SNP data there. If it's only for a few genes, you can try to piece together phasing information.  PM me if you need more details."

bioinformatics,3co35m,pblova91,3,Thu Jul 9 14:29:56 2015 UTC,"There are several E. coli strains on NCBI that have been resequenced and annotated throughout the years and genotypes revised due to this.   However, general good microbiology technique is to make multiple glycerol stocks of strains when they are originally acquired. This way you can go back and streak out fresh plates of the bacteria for different experiments, limiting the mutations caused by propogation. This is not the case with people doing evolution experiments where it would then be standard practice to sequence the strains every so many propogations to analyze the mutations that lead to different phenotypes."
bioinformatics,3co35m,pblova91,2,Thu Jul 9 13:54:45 2015 UTC,I was briefly working in a phage lab studying adaptive evolution and we would do this all the time. The difference here is the constant selective pressure(s) being experimentally applied. It sounds like an interesting thing to do for your strain if you have some extra money for sequencing.
bioinformatics,3co35m,jlynnrd,2,Thu Jul 9 14:02:22 2015 UTC,"That's effectively what I'm thinking is going on - that over the 12 years, the strain will have mutated such that the organisms at the moment has developed into a much more 'culture-adapted' phenotype than it was when initially sequenced in 2003 (a few years after isolation). You could call it the inadvertent evolution experiment.  I work in proteomics so my interest lies in the degree to which tryptic peptides may have changed over the 12 years such that any data analysis we do - using the 2003 genome as a searching database - may not be the ideal route and may indeed be limiting what we're able to find in our proteomic data.   Any suggestion on organisms who have had a similar (deliberate) evolutionary experiment where I might be able to access their data?"

For drosophila cell lines somebody also did a resequencing to see how much copy number variation was going on (quite a bit) and in the 2 most extreme cases they also sequenced the same cell line from two different labs (and they didn't match all to much).

For better or worse, Vim and Emacs conform to the 'alien artifact' theory of user interface design. So the learning curve is a tad brutal. The other downside is that once you master Vim and Emacs, you may find it difficult to tolerate Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and their fanboys.  Which is not to say that IDEs are without virtue. They are great. They just tend to lack precisely those virtues which Vim and Emacs happen to possess, and vice versa.

bioinformatics,3cjvp6,aconz2,5,Wed Jul 8 14:42:57 2015 UTC,"Why are you using a Python script for this? md5sum does everything you need, and most likely much faster."
bioinformatics,3cjvp6,DangerousPie,3,Wed Jul 8 15:22:27 2015 UTC,My first thought is that you should just let your trusty script run longer.
bioinformatics,3cjvp6,Simusid,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:22:20 2015 UTC,I would... but after several hours I realized it's not a feasible solution in the long-run . I will have hundreds of files to check in the near future so run time will be an issue.
bioinformatics,3cjvp6,TheLordB,2,Wed Jul 8 15:18:24 2015 UTC,Keep in mind you are going to be limited by your IO.  I'm fairly sure md5sum has to read every bit (my quick googling has failed to confirm or deny this though).  So if it takes you 1 hour to read a 100GB file it is going to take 1 hour to do the md5sum.  Also python may be much slower unless it is hitting a c library to do the check summing.  I would also stick with the builtin GNU md5sum rather than using python.  Also might be worth not bothering and just going with it.  I have never bothered to checksum these things unless I actually get an error.  I don't think I can think of a time where there was an actual issue with the file being corrupt though I have ruled it out a few times.
bioinformatics,3cjvp6,arstin,3,Wed Jul 8 15:48:38 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly sure md5sum has to read every bit   It does. A checksum based on the first 5MB could only be used to verify the integrity of the first 5MB.   Also might be worth not bothering and just going with it.   Doing the check is a good habit. Like all good habits, you have to weigh the inconvenience against the risk of inconvenience. The chance of getting a corrupt, but well-formed fastq file is really, really low. So as long as your tools croak on malformed input, you are probably safe. But if you have tools that are happy to take garbage in and spit garbage out you can end up wasting a lot of time tracing an error in the middle of your pipeline back to corrupt fastq files."
bioinformatics,3cjvp6,crashfrog,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:35:33 2015 UTC,"Also python may be much slower unless it is hitting a c library to do the check summing. I would also stick with the builtin GNU md5sum rather than using python.   My sense of it is that Python is calling down to C-based hash libraries, but you're still going to see a slowdown from Python's slower IO. You can really speed things up, though, if you remember to explicitly read through large-ish blocks (I usually pick a couple of mb) instead of using Python's file-iterator construct (i.e. 'for line in filehandle:'.)"
bioinformatics,3cjvp6,hywelbane,2,Wed Jul 8 23:41:39 2015 UTC,"What are you doing with the BAMs after you check the md5s?  I ask because it's possible that you could integrate the MD5 checking into another step that you need to do and make it essentially free.  As /u/TheLordB points out, you're almost certainly IO limited - even if your filesystem can sustain 15MB/s, it'll take two hours to read through the entire file.  Not sure if you program or not, and in what language...  One approach, taken by HTSJDK (of which I'm a contributor) is to create input and output streams that really just pass the data through, but on the way through use Java's MD5 digest implementation to calculate the MD5 of the data flowing through the stream.  The result is that the library can generate MD5s with nearly no additional overhead while either reading or writing a BAM file for another purpose.  I imagine it's probably not that hard to do something similar in Python or another language."

I really just need to get out there and start talking to people in industry that can help me direct my dissertation in a way that will make me desireable to industry. There are some meetups I plan to go to, I have friends who have worked in industry, conferences and summer schools to make collaborations, and I am sure there's dozens of people on campus who would be willing to offer their advice.    My advice would be to see if you can find a different lab in your program, or try to set up a dual-PI scenario, hopefully with someone in e.g. the CS or stats depts at your university or a nearby university.

Though probably somewhat hard to get quite that high right out of school even with a masters.  I really wish academia didn't push down salaries so much...

I'm pursing my PhD in Health Informatics after I finished my MS in Bioinformatics.  My favorite image to explain the spectrum of health informatics compared to bioinformatics is this one. Bioinformatics really focuses on molecular and cellular level of things. Health Informatics aligns more with clinical informatics and public health informatics. So while bioinformatics is focused on the micro level, health informatics is more on the macro level.  Since you've got the health IT background, really the tools you will be learning about is how to extract meaning from all that data you've been compiling in EHRs. Network analysis, text mining, medical ontologies, and clinical decision support systems are all things that you will probably get exposure to.  So to answer some of your questions:   Would the MS in Health Informatics provide any value based on my experiences?    Yes, you've had exposure how to use these tools, now you will be in a position to learn on how to improve them and gain better understanding from the data embedded in those systems.   Will my experience + MS Health Informatics allow me to join the world of Bioinformatics one day if I choose to do so? I’m aware I would need heavy Biology knowledge in addition to the technical skills.   Yep, to be successful in bioinformatics you really need to understand the biology. The wider your base of knowledge, the more useful you can become. A lot of bioinformatics folks that I know that have come over from the CS end of the spectrum started small, perhaps with a single organelle, or system and slowly expanded their knowledge from there. Given your skill set, I would probably advocate to look into translational bioinformatics more so than straight bioinformatics. Bioinformatics makes the discoverers, translational bioinformatics tries to figure out how to apply those discoveries.   Any Health Informatics communities and resources out there?   AMIA is a good starting point. I submitted to present at their annual symposium but didn't make the cut. There is always next year.  Hope this helps!"

bioinformatics,3cg3af,ringo_24601,2,Thu Jul 9 14:09:55 2015 UTC,"I've worked in academia as a Bioinformatics research assistant in the UK (3 years) and now I work in health IT (10 years).. so I guess I've done the opposite of what you're trying to do. I am a Genetics major and have a masters degree in bioinformatics. Moving from Bioinformatics to medical IT was scarily easy and my skill set was well received.  The key difference, I think, comes from the complexity of data. In health informatics, you are dealing with complex data objects, that contain fairly simple data items. Bioinformatics deals with more simple data objects, but far more complex data items.  There are branches of bioinformatics that involve themselves with data mining (e.g. R use) that you might align yourself with well. There are similar issues with ontologies (e.g. SNOMED codes) and biological ontologies. You'd probably be better looking at these sort of areas of bioinformatics than the -omics side of things.  Career wise, i'm sticking in medical IT. I have been approached by bioinformatics startups to work on the 'medical IT' side of things - but ultimately medical IT pays better. We've got some work on a national genomics database coming up, so that pleases the science-geek in me.  Honestly, I don't think there is enough overlap in 'informatics' between your course and say, MS bioinformatics, to really provide an easy transfer.

bioinformatics,3cfe1a,bozleh,2,Tue Jul 7 15:50:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe! From what I've noticed, the term multiallelic (tri-allelic, etc.) refer to locations that have multiple reference bases. But in the case where you find two non-reference alleles at a location with just one reference base maybe it should be referred to as ""multiallelic non-reference""?"
bioinformatics,3cfe1a,heresacorrection,2,Tue Jul 7 19:06:50 2015 UTC,I don't think there is a specific name for such a thing. You would just say that there are multiple allelic variants of the given gene.  However it's not clear how you are defining your mutation. Are these SNPs or INDELs or something else?  Are they in the same location or just different parts of the same gene?  A compound het is a specific case in which both alleles are recessive per se.
bioinformatics,3cfe1a,heresacorrection,4,Tue Jul 7 18:13:34 2015 UTC,"I've been doing some digging and I think you are correct, there may not be a specific name for this type of occurrence.   To answer your question: this is a single SNP where one allele ended up being a G, the other a T, with neither being the reference A.   So it is a heterozygous mutation, but obviously I feel uncomfortable calling it that because one would then assume one allele is reference while the other is either G or T. Which isn't the case."

I think it's honestly between you and your supervisor/PI. Seeing as how a decent percentage of bioinformatics positions are in academia or follow academic culture, it seems like ad hoc arrangements regarding telecommuting is the norm.

bioinformatics,3cd0lw,BrianCalves,2,Tue Jul 7 00:37:11 2015 UTC,"do you predict [telecommuting] positions becoming more common in the future?   Not anytime soon. Telecommuting requires self-discipline and good communication skills. And there is no reliable way to measure productivity in many jobs. In light of those difficulties, supervisors often prefer to visually confirm that worker butts are in company chairs 8+ hours per day.  If the economy deteriorates, people will probably become anxious, causing a reversion to authoritarian employment policies (even less telecommuting).  There will always be exceptions, but I don't expect to see a big shift in favor of telecommuting. A lot of companies would rather pay a cadaver in a cubicle than hire a telecommuter.  Ironically, if you want to telecommute, find a group of like-minded individuals and move to some hellish far-flung continent. Then pretend that you don't speak your employer's language.

However, I work on a team that's become quite close knit, so it is probably unrealistic to think that I could direct projects remotely.  There are just too many details that need instant feedback.   We did use skype and set up meetings, all that jazz, but it's just not the same.   Would I hire someone to work remotely?  Probably not, unless it was in the same circumstances I was in - temporarily on the way to relocating.  It turned out to be a great transition and really made the whole thing much more bearable:  I had already made massive strides in the development component of the position, and knew my colleagues before I officially started on site, so the job itself wasn't a surprise (at least, it wasn't more stressful than before) during the move.

bioinformatics,3ca4ib,iggyazaleatown,3,Mon Jul 6 08:08:15 2015 UTC,"I always make a point of telling people that bioinformatics isn't one career.  It's a broad category of careers.  There are people doing bioinformatics (computational biology) who know next to zero programming, but use computer tools developed by others to study biology.  There are programmers who know zero biology, who help other people develop tools.  The best part of bioinformatics happens in the middle, when people know both the biology and the computer science, because they can be the real innovators.  They can invent and test their own tools, they can use algorithms to develop insight into the biology, and they can build off the biology to develop better algorithms.  Industry needs all types of people, since ""industry"" isn't a single thing, and there will always be companies looking for different skill sets.  However, the best paid positions will generally go to the people who live on the middle ground, spanning both degrees.  To know programming, you can get by being self taught or with a bachelors.  Programming is all about patters and routines and learning best practices.  These are things you can learn on your own...  and most likely a bachelors or a couple years of real experience will suffice to become good at it.  (Some people, less, others... more.)  As for the biology, that's all about exceptions, and principles, and understanding how all of the layers of complexity interact.  A masters or a PhD in biology or bioinformatics can be a major game changer - particularly since bioinformatics is still pretty academic in nature.  (There are definitely people who started before there were actual PhDs in bioinformatics, and such, but that's becoming more rare, as mobility in the field is becoming more tightly tied to academic qualification and experience.)  So, at the end of the day, the real answer is that you need to decide what you want to do in bioinformatics, and then figure out what qualifications will get you there.    But yeah, R... wouldn't go there unless you have a reason.  It's one of the tools, but not the only one.  (It's also the hardest for people who don't have a programming background, and is the least transferrable knowledge.   Most languages share a lot more in common, so learning python will help you with other languages, whereas R is really ""unique."")"
bioinformatics,3ca4ib,apfejes,2,Mon Jul 6 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I guess my main question is -- will my job prospects be extremely limited without a masters? Are most companies against self-taught coders? I'd prefer going into the programming aspect of bioinformatics, and would be fine starting off at an entry position if I was able to further myself, career-wise, in the future."
bioinformatics,3ca4ib,apfejes,3,Tue Jul 7 01:50:24 2015 UTC,"Don't think of the market in terms of what you're willing to take.  Employers don't really care about that.  Instead, for every position you're interested in, think about who else is applying for the same job.    If you want an entry level programming position, you're probably up against people with comp sci bachelors, or engineering degrees.  Why would they hire a biologist?  Who would you pick?  The core of the matter is how you show to a prospective employer how you can do the job - a repository of good programming examples, contributions to existing projects, experience building software in a team.  The more you can show, the better you can compete.   Obviously, you're coming in with a biology background, so think of the jobs that you'd be qualified for with and without a masters - and think of the experience you'd bring if you had two years of bioinformatics hands-on practice. Which would an employer rather have?  Yes, that depends on the job, and that brings us back to where I started.  Figure out what job you want, then figure out what you need to get that job."
bioinformatics,3ca4ib,neurobry,3,Tue Jul 7 02:34:58 2015 UTC,"Don't worry too much about C++ at this stage - yeah, it's a nice plus, but in the end I write C++ code about once a year because there are just very few cases where there really is the performance demand that requires it. The most important thing for you to learn right now is going to be unix/bash and affiliated commands (grep, sed, awk, etc). I've been doing bioinformatics for about 5 years, and while I may write code in different languages at different points in time, writing one liners and pipes is by far the more common task that I'm faced with (I do a lot of perl one liners as well). Learning a good text editor (e.g. vi/vim) is going to also be very useful (ie coding without a mouse).  Following that, I'd prioritize python heavily (with numpy/scipy along with a plotting program) unless there's a specific R/Bioconductor library that you need. After that, THEN you dig into C++.  Regarding education, I'd suggest a masters in CS and then go into industry. You might waste too much time in a bioinformatics masters which would end up just repeating stuff you already know (yawn operons).  Good luck!"

It's totally possible (in fact, I've done it), but if you want the best chance for the long run, having a really solid platform to work from is critical.  In any case, you need some solid math to be able to speak confidently about statistics, which is a MAJOR part of bioinformatics these days. Look at some job advertisements and see what they ask for - 90% of the time, there is a requirement for R/Bioconductor together with a strong understanding of statistics."
bioinformatics,3ca4ib,rudyzhou2,2,Tue Jul 7 08:39:10 2015 UTC,"I would suggest the more the better but you would suffice with good linux/python and/or R to start.

bioinformatics,3bx3em,rainbowmoose420,14,Thu Jul 2 21:35:04 2015 UTC,"Ok --- so it seems this question comes up a lot (I'm going to sit down and write a blog post about this at some point).  There are a couple of things worth pointing out from your question.  First, most packages do not support the use of TPM or FPKM for differential expression testing.  This means that e.g. it's completely wrong to feed them to programs expecting counts (e.g. DESeq2 or EdgeR).  One reason for this is that these measures are normalized.  What I mean by this is that, for example, if you sum the TPM of all genes/transcripts in a sample, the sum will always be 1,000,000; this is a direct result of the way TPM is calculated.  FPKM will behave in a similar manner (though, as many have pointed out, TPM should always be preferred to FPKM which has a more arbitrary and less stable normalization term).  Some tools do make use of FPKM for differential expression testing (the Tuxedo tools), but they also maintain extra information about samples (e.g. the total number of reads) that allow for the proper comparison of these normalized measures across samples.  On the other hand, most popular stand-alone DE tools (e.g. DESeq2, EdgeR, etc.) expect counts as input.  This is because they perform their own, internal, normalization to help account for effect size (1000 reads coming from a transcript means something different when there are 10 million reads in my sample vs. 50 million). My personal recommendation would be to use salmon (disclosure: I'm the author of this tool ;P) to process your sample, and then feed the ""NumReads"" column (appropriately rounded) to a DE tool like DESeq2.  That being said, the pipeline that it sounds like you followed (i.e. TopHat => Cufflinks => CuffDiff) is not unreasonable --- these tools were meant to be used together.  While some recent surveys have shown that they can be outperformed by other methods, I don't believe there is anything systematically wrong on that front.  On a finer point, regarding what was said by the professor that    FPKM values are too normalized, and that you loose accuracy if the gene is incorrectly annotated and/or the gene is very short or very long.   apart from what I mentioned above (i.e. FPKM values are already normalized by the number of mapping reads so you don't want to use them with a tool that then performs its own, separate normalization) --- this statement doesn't really make sense.  Perhaps we're missing some context.  You might always lose accuracy if the annotation is incorrect.  Furthermore, transcript length can be a confounding factor, but this is moreso the case for methods that don't attempt to resolve the origin of transcriptomically multimapping reads (e.g. HTSeq) than methods that do (e.g. Cufflinks)."
bioinformatics,3bx3em,nomad42184,4,Fri Jul 3 02:05:08 2015 UTC,"Man, Rob. You're everywhere :).  I would actually argue that the cuffdiff pipeline is a little unreasonable. The ballgown paper showed a skewed pvalue distribution for differential expression of what was null data.  The rest of it, I agree with."
bioinformatics,3bx3em,merkinj,5,Fri Jul 3 03:53:44 2015 UTC,"Reddit is basically where I live ;P (big fan of /r/programming, /r/cpp, /r/compsci etc.) Thanks for your comment; I remember seeing this in the Ballgown paper now.  The claim is that this leads to a significantly reduced sensitivity, right?  That is, CuffDiff tends to fail to call truly DE genes as DE.  I guess I should re-word / amend my response a bit.  The approach the OP has taken isn't theorietically wrong (i.e. a tool can make use of FPKM if it also knows the full library size (because e.g. one can always recover the estimated # of reads from the FPKM, library size and transcript lengths)), but, as you point out, the CuffDiff approach is significantly flawed --- probably for other methodological reasons."
bioinformatics,3bx3em,nomad42184,2,Fri Jul 3 14:20:18 2015 UTC,"Heh, i lurk some of those, though i don't code in c++.  Yeah, that sounds familiar.

bioinformatics,3bx3em,leftyteck,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:49:27 2015 UTC,"Cuffdiff now includes a new statistical test. Prior versions used a delta method based test, which lacked power for designs with more than a few replicates. The new test directly samples from the beta negative binomial model for each transcript in each condition in order to estimate the null distribution of its log fold change under the null hypothesis.   Sampling from the beta negative binomial distribution means they are using the counts, which are generally assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution, such as by other DE packages like DESeq2 or edgeR.  The beta negative binomial distribution is a discrete distribution, so it couldn't be used with a continuous measure like FPKM.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_negative_binomial_distribution  Edit: this article goes much further into the new algorithm. They don't use what they call the ""raw counts"", but they do use counts following ""isoform deconvolution""   Cuffdiff 2 assumes that the expression of a transcript in each condition can be measured by counting the number of fragments generated by it. Thus, a change in the expression level of a transcript is measured by comparing its fragment count in each condition.    http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n1/full/nbt.2450.html"

bioinformatics,3bx3em,splatterdash,4,Fri Jul 3 03:07:55 2015 UTC,"Is it necessarily wrong to present data as FPKM values?   I can be wrong, the original author (or one of the early ones) who proposed FPKM now revised his stance and suggests TKM's (I'm talking of Lior Pachter who is also behind the suit suite)  The short version is many genes are up regulated FPKM of constantly expressed genes will effectively decrease.  That said FPKM is generally better than raw read counts, I have never heard that criticism before. If the gene is incorrectly annotated you will lose accuracy in any case. And with the raw reads you will get differences just due to the sequencing depth, so you at least have to correct for that.  (The only real problem I can see with FPKM/TKM is regards to what your professor said is that for very short genes, dividing by the gene length can make noise fluctuations seem much more significant. But I am quite sure that Cuffdiff takes something like that into account.)"
bioinformatics,3bx3em,murgs,4,Thu Jul 2 22:07:58 2015 UTC,"That said FPKM is generally better than raw read counts   Not for differential expression analysis. As Rob (/u/nomad42184) explains above, several DE tools simply don’t accept normalised counts as input, and do the wrong thing when force-fed normalised input. This is true for both FPKM and TPM, by the way."
bioinformatics,3bx3em,guepier,2,Fri Jul 3 09:08:14 2015 UTC,"Ok, that was bad wording, but the DE tools that use count data as input transform it internally to FPKM/TKM or something very similar, so the differential expression analysis is based on it and not the raw read counts after all. And I agree Rob explains it all nicely."
bioinformatics,3bx3em,murgs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:25:00 2015 UTC,"the DE tools that use count data as input transform it internally to FPKM/TKM or something very similar   No, the normalisations used in DE tools are not related to FPKM or TPM. The whole point is that FPKM and TPM do a within-sample normalisation, which allows comparing features within a library.  Differential expression analysis doesn’t compare features within a library however. On the contrary, it compares features between libraries — so these normalisations couldn’t be less well suited:  Assume you have a feature matrix M where m[i, j] is a count for feature i in library j. FPKM and TPM makes features m[x, j] and m[y, j] comparable. But DE tools need to compare features m[i, x] and m[i, y].  And the reason that DE tools don’t accept FPKM/TPM input isn’t only because they perform (a different) normalisation internally, but because FPKM/TPM actually loses information from the raw counts (this information can be retrieved, but not from the normalised counts alone)."
bioinformatics,3bx3em,guepier,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:23:08 2015 UTC,"No, the normalisations used in DE tools are not related to FPKM or TPM. The whole point is that FPKM and TPM do a within-sample normalisation, which allows comparing features within a library.   They both have a sample size correction which isn't needed if only comparing inside a library. Sure they are the most crude ways of doing it (TPM being actually relatively good given you only look at the single library) and therefore the DE tools use the raw counts and more sophisticated normalizations (comparing multiple libraries), but saying they aren't related is just as wrong as my bad initial formulation that they are always better. (Since as you say you do lose information.)  The point I was trying to make was that comparing raw read counts is worse than comparing TPM's, if you compare them directly. If you use an analysis tool that of course isn't the case. I.e:  DE normalized/modelled > TPM > FPKM > raw counts"
bioinformatics,3bx3em,murgs,9,Sun Jul 5 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"So first, I'm by no means an expert on this, but I figured my input might be useful. I've previously heard criticism against FPKM in that the normalization factor can be different across samples which would create differences across the samples being compared. I searched around and found this paper which says something similar about FPKM to what that professor told you. Some people thus prefer TPM for its fixed normalization factor allowing for better comparisons across different samples. The researcher who created FPKM actually changed his stance on FPKM and recommends TPM. As far as using raw values in a differential expression analysis, I've never heard of this. Library sizes vary and thus normalization should be performed before trying to do some type of differential expression analysis. The normalization technique that should be used, however, still varies as there doesn't appear to be an agreed upon standard at this time."

RPKM was in Mortazavi's original RNA-seq paper.  But Pachter is also behind TopHat and Cufflinks, so he's much more responsible for how everyone's using FPKM these days anyway. And he says don't."

bioinformatics,3bx3em,jehosephass,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:25:50 2015 UTC,"Can you explain how FPKM gets ""screwed up"" for long or short genes?"
bioinformatics,3bx3em,leftyteck,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:40:16 2015 UTC,"While I'm not a believer that it actually does get screwed up --- there is an artifact that appears when using FPKM with effective length correction for very short transcripts.  The effective length of a transcript is simply the sum of the characteristic function on the transcript convolved with the fragment length distribution (i.e. you compute, at each position on the transcript, what is the probability that a fragment could start there given the empirical fragment length distribution).  Effective length correction is meant to account for the fact that e.g. you can't sample a fragment of length 500 starting from 100bp before the end of the transcript --- essentially, it accounts for ""edge effects"".  However, for very short transcripts, the effective length becomes tiny.  This can tend to over-correct for sampling bias, and can lead to vastly inflated estimates of the FPKM of very short transcripts.  Of course, this problem doesn't really pop up if effective length correction isn't enabled (Cufflinks e.g. has an option to turn it off) --- but having the correction on is the default behavior.  However, I'm not really sure what the complaint is for long transcripts."
bioinformatics,3bx3em,nomad42184,2,Mon Jul 6 04:53:33 2015 UTC,You should definitely be displaying the normalized counts (CPM/RPKM/FPKM/something better) when presenting your data (e.g. bar plots). The raw counts are essentially meaningless if you haven't normalized to library size. You can show the raw counts for informative purposes; but to make conclusions based on them is not a wise decision.  As other users have noted you shouldn't be feeding these normalized counts into DE programs as raw counts. But as far as your question is concerned it doesn't seem like that's what you are doing...

More coding knowledge may help you write scripts for data munging/analysis faster but at the end of the day, you'll need to come up with interesting biological findings to publish so a good grasp of cancer biology is pretty important. My impression is that most bioinformatics lab take students as the cost for bioinformatics labs is typically lower than a wetlab. When  I went to interview, I talked to a few PI's about their research and learnt whether they took students or not. Also GSBS covered first 2 years of stipend, so your PI doesn't have to pay you until your 3rd year.     It takes somewhere from 4-6 years to finish.    I like that my lab is small (me, post-doc and another grad student) we all have our own projects, my PI doesn't micromanage, the downside is that if i need help with coding or analysis tools, I'll have actively find students in other labs or go on biostar/seqanswers/stackexchange. So really think about what kind of lab you want to be in as there are very different bioinformatics/biostat lab.
