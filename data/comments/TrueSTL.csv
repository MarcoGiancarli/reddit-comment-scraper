It’s not just that we have an irreconcilable difference of opinion. It’s that we, the veterans of /r/teslore, BGSF, #memospore and the like, are vastly better informed on the nature of sources, unreliable narrators, and the history of Michael Kirkbride’s involvement with Bethesda than the people (seemingly! I haven’t seen any evidence to the contrary!) we are arguing against who attempt to insist upon canonicity. Really, just look at any recent BGSF thread where this is brought up - a dozen anti-canon experts post intricate, essay-length explanations while the two or three canon-advocates seemingly don’t process, understand, or engage with any of the evidence, and just retreat to petulant complaining. I don’t even approach this as a matter of philosophy. There’s simply a knowledge deficiency on one side of this that turns the whole thing into a farce. It’s not elitism to recognize the truth that we ARE the elites, people who debate the intricacies of lore on BGSF or /r/teslore or TIL, and among our number there are vanishingly few people who have ever mounted a sustained defense of canonicity in the Elder Scrolls, while the vast majority of us who DO wade into these debates attack the concept. Because a defense can’t really be made in good faith by a scholar as informed as we are. Anyone who looks at the preponderance of evidence with an open mind knows this. At this point the only people left arguing against it are the willfully and aggressively ignorant."

They contain many, usually unisexual flowers, arranged closely along a central stem which is often drooping. They are found in many plant families, including Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Moraceae, and Salicaceae. For some time, they were believed to be a key synapomorphy among the proposed Hamamelididae, but it is now believed that this flower arrangement has arisen independently by convergent evolution on a number of occasions.

TrueSTL,3cohgf,Qu1nlan,8,Thu Jul 9 14:29:44 2015 UTC,"this question can be seen this way  In Skyrim, there is a piece of dialogue that says   ""Dwarven centurions are the largest and strongest creations the Dwemer left behind after their disappearance. Designed in the form of a massively armored warrior with a hammer on one arm and a spring-loaded battleaxe on the other, they are formidable enemies that typically serve as the boss of their dungeon. In addition to their incredibly strong melee attacks which can be on par with those of a dragon, they can unleash a powerful steam breath attack that functions like a shout. Combining these features with the set of resistances that nearly all Dwarven automatons have and their very high health stats makes them an adversary not to be trifled with. Usually centurions are not found simply wandering around a Dwarven ruin, but instead are found immobile within their charging gantries until they are activated either by proximity, lever, or being attacked at range. This can oftentimes give ranged attackers a chance to get a few shots in with either their bow or a spell before the automaton can fully activate and engage in melee range. In some cases these great constructs are even used as traps to prevent any would-be treasure hunter from plundering the ruins they protect. If you are a low-level melee character, a surprisingly effective strategy is to get as close to them as possible, to the extent that your character is physically touching the centurion's legs. This is effective because centurions cannot lower their arms or tilt their heads to attack enemies beneath their shoulders, thus enabling you to encircle them and avoid their attacks with relative ease. Another great strategy is to get them stuck outside of a small hallway and get out of range of their steam attack, allowing you to hit it with ranged attacks. It is worth noting when facing them that they are immune to nearly all shouts except for Unrelenting Force, which causes them to stagger, and Marked for Death. Sometimes when using Unrelenting Force on a centurion before it has activated from within its gantry, it can be rendered inert and it will not activate immediately, enabling you to strike it at will for a time. When defeated, a centurion can be looted for a guaranteed Centurion Dynamo Core, a Grand Soul Gem, a number of Dwarven scraps, leveled arrows, and a few precious gems.""   , and if you look at the way the dwemer sometimes burn black here, it would not be hard to infer that Powered combat armor[1] is the peak of armored infantry technology, initially developed in the West Tek Research Facility laboratories. Now, only the most technologically advanced factions with ties to pre-War military or government, such as the Brotherhood of Steel or the Enclave, have access to them, and only the latter possesses the technology required to manufacture new power armor models, such as the advanced power armor and advanced power armor Mk II. Before any users can use power armor however, they must receive power armor training first.  The first version of power armor successfully deployed in combat was the T-45d model, which originally ran on small energy cells, burning through them at an alarming rate. In response, later versions were manufactured with built-in Microfusion Packs.  The most advanced pre-War model, T-51b power armor is fitted with a back-mounted TX-28 MicroFusion Pack which generates 60,000 Watts to power the HiFlo hydraulic systems built into the frame of the suit. Made of the poly-laminate composite, the T-51b shell is lightweight and capable of absorbing over 2500 Joules of kinetic impact. The 10 micron silver ablative coating can reflect laser and radiation emissions without damage to the composite subsurface.  T-51b power armor and later models also include a complete waste recycling system.  In one of the conversations with Ricky in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Honest Hearts, it is revealed that the eyeslits of T-series power armor are bullet-proof.  The Hēi Guǐ stealth armor kept the Chinese near the same level as the United States, but not by much.  Here is another point, in this apocrypha [insert an fanfic here], it is suggested that the [question] can also be seen in this way [insert a point which is essentially the same as above], although I personally think that [insert shitty headcanon that nobody asked for and tells also basically the same thing]  In addition, in this MK text, [Insert yet another confusing MK text], he said that [a quote], now this maybe [confusing/hard to understand/outright strange], but I think that it actually means [insert pointlessly long explanations of MK text which has already been explained two years ago], now this might seem completely irrelevant, but also consider this [yet another MK text], it starts to make sense. Now you might consider MK's source to be not canon, [insert yet another MK rant], but I do believe that this piece is well written.  In conclusion The Dragonborn add-on added a couple follower automatons to the game. These automatons function identically to the corresponding automatons above in combat style and behavior, but are friendly toward the player, can be spoken to, and can be recruited to follow the player. These followers occupy the creature follower spot, and can thus be used alongside an NPC follower, but cannot be used alongside another creature follower. Unlike other followers in-game, these creatures do not level with the player, but instead have their stats fixed when the player enters the cell within which they exist, in this case Kagrumez's interior. Power Armour is an advanced form of powered combat armour, worn primarily by the Space Marines and the Chaos Space Marines. It is a completely enclosed suit of combat armour composed of shaped Adamantium and Plasteel plates, encased in a Ceramite ablative layer. Each suit possesses a full suite of life-support functions for operation in hostile environments, an automated medicae system to provide some level of first aid to a wounded wearer and a highly advanced and fully integrated tactical targeting and threat analysis system known as Auto-senses. The suit would be heavy and cumbersome to wear but for the electrically motivated fibre bundles within the armour that replicates the wearer's movement and enhances his strength beyond its already considerable superhuman baseline (for Space Marines). Whilst Power Armour is most commonly associated with the Space Marines of the Adeptus Astartes, the Sisters of Battle and many Inquisitors also use powered armour of one sort or another. Typically, however, these armours may not contain the same strength-enhancing properties or life-support functions of Space Marine Power Armour, nor do they always provide the same level of protection. The enclosing suits of armour worn by Space Marines are made from thick ceramite plates and would be cumbersome but for electrically motivated fibre bundles that replicate the movements of the wearer and supplement his strength. The last gene-seed organ to be implanted in a Space Marine –- the Black Carapace –- rests beneath the skin, itself fitted with neural sensors and transfusion ports. These plug-in points mesh with Space Marine Power Armour, linking the wearer's nervous system to his suit's mind impulse controls, turning the suit into a second skin that moves with all the speed and precision of the Battle-Brother's own body. Without the Black Carapace, Space Marine Armour is almost useless, and it is therefore the most distinctive feature of a Space Marine and the true mark of the Adeptus Astartes.There are several patterns (or ""marks"") of Power Armour, whose appearances differ significantly. Many older marks have special associations for certain Chapters and are often worn by their ceremonial Honour Guards or elite units. Power Armour is maintained by skilled Artificers who are not Space Marines, but servants who spend their lives working for the Chapter. Especially talented Artificers are justly celebrated, and examples of their work highly prized. Elements of ancient armour are religiously hunted down, for they carry both the history of the Chapter and the deeds of heroic individuals. Such pieces are lovingly restored and painstakingly engraved with new designs. As a result, it is quite common to find Power Armour that combines pieces from different marks, every greave and gorget a recollection of mighty deeds and battles won.
