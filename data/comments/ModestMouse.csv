ModestMouse,3e49se,DfizzleShizzle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing for strangers to ourselves. I was going to buy the cd at this record store by my place, but I've had the album since it leaked and whenever I buy cds I never listen to them, I always just buy them to support the artist and so I have something physical to show for the money I paid for. So in the end I just bought the record and used it as a poster. The cover looks great on the wall as do the planets on the records themselves. Definitely thinking of buying some other records of theirs even if I dint own a record player."

ModestMouse,3e24fc,tynamite,4,Tue Jul 21 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"Monitors so that he can hear himself and his band mates. You wouldn't expect it, but its VERY hard to hear yourself and other instruments when playing a show. With mm adding so many touring band members, a lot of monitors is probably necessary."

I hear influences from Modest Mouse, Built to Spill (especially in your direct homage in ""No Matter"", and Elliott Smith, but it still has a very unique sound. I'm honored to be your first bandcamp supporter. So much great music coming out of Philly these days. Keep it up!  Do you know Alex G or Cold Foamers?"
ModestMouse,3dxv6q,styrofoamboots7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:19:03 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I'm glad a BTS fan got to hear that :) Thanks for the support!  Elliott is great. I love singing along with him (not saying I do it well :-p) so I'm glad a bit of his sound made it into the EP :)  I don't know them? Always looking for new music though - got any specific recommendations from them?"
ModestMouse,3dxv6q,styrofoamboots7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:31:21 2015 UTC,Well Cold Foamers only has one released EP called All Cold Everything and I guess I'd say start with Alex G's newest album DSU. It's not my favorite but certainly the most refined and well produced. The reason I mention them is they are both really great small indie bands based in Philly with a similar style to yours. There's something about Philadelphia musicians. I don't know what it is but every time I hear great music these days I look to the side and see Philadelphia.
ModestMouse,3dxv6q,swiftmaggot,6,Wed Jul 22 04:48:50 2015 UTC,"I dig it! If I may offer my opinion- I think the distortion of your vocals is just ok. I really am enjoying the music but it tends to swallow the defining edges of your voice especially in places where you sing the same notes as you're playing.  Which isn't a bad thing by any means. Reminds me of very early MM or Neutral Milk Hotel. Impossible Engine is a lovely track, the second half/crescendo is a whole lot of fun. Overall this is really solid, keep it up!"
ModestMouse,3dxv6q,deadkathy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:20:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, vocals are tough for me and the overdubbing tends to wash away the edges. I plan on trying for a clearer (but I still like the lo-fi to some degree) vocal sound for the future. NHM is excellent - an honor to be compared there as well :)"
ModestMouse,3dxv6q,raining_picnic,4,Tue Jul 21 11:27:15 2015 UTC,"Wow. Excellent stuff, dude. Impossible Engine is definitely the highlight for me. I really hope you keep making music, and I hope you share it here."
ModestMouse,3dxv6q,IAmACollegeStudent1,2,Mon Jul 20 23:24:36 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks a bunch! Yeah Impossible Engine and/or Point Nemo were probably the inspiration for the rest of the EP. I have plans for a second, maybe even third EP now so... hold tight :)"
ModestMouse,3dxv6q,TheAllStarrBand,3,Tue Jul 21 11:24:36 2015 UTC,good job dude!

ModestMouse,3e0rzw,PlacentaSandwich,5,Tue Jul 21 04:34:31 2015 UTC,"The entirety of this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3SAui320L8   Don't know much about it other than it was just a live improv thing Isaac did at the end of trucker's atlas (crazy to tag another 4 minutes onto the end of that song). Also cool how a lot of the lyrics/themes were in M&A's ""The Stars are Projectors"" and ""Life Like Weeds"" that weren't released for another year or two.  I like the idea that we get to know everything when we die. Would be tight."
ModestMouse,3e0rzw,jerpty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:27:00 2015 UTC,"ooh yeah I love that one. My favorite in that song is ""you'll pace around this building, you'll pace around this planet.""

This was a great show, very high energy and the sound was different than I've ever heard them, but the setlist kinda disappointed. I left during Widespread Panic, and I said in the car that if Modest Mouse had played until midnight, I'd still be right there. It was hot as balls, but worth every second."

ModestMouse,3e1ahw,The_Moondoggie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:25:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah right. I think it's fair to say that, even though none of us really know Issac, his Twitter account wouldn't look like that. I can't imagine a guy like him wants a twitter, anyways."

ModestMouse,3dy9p3,MsMagee,2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:25 2015 UTC,Good to know! I live close enough by that I was planning on arriving early and doing some scouting!
ModestMouse,3dy9p3,wheaser,3,Mon Jul 20 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"I got my Modest Mouse setlist at a festival, but what usually works is, try getting there early enough to be up front, and hang out a bit while the stage is being packed up and ask one of the crew members (not security) for a setlist. They're usually pretty sweet about it as they get asked at nearly every show.   Meeting them, MsMagee has the best advice, find the busses and try to hang out for a bit after the show (or get there WAY early and try your luck). Sometimes you have to do a bit of waiting for the artists to leave the venue. Hope this helps! Enjoy your show!"
ModestMouse,3dy9p3,MsMagee,3,Mon Jul 20 19:29:49 2015 UTC,"I know it can be a long wait after, but before hand the band is in a really different mode.  They are fine tuning the set list, warming up and getting their heads into performance frame.  So, just be aware that before the show you might get a different vibe because of their being preoccupied with the job of being ready for performing and all that goes with it."
ModestMouse,3dy9p3,wheaser,2,Mon Jul 20 20:30:23 2015 UTC,Agreed!
ModestMouse,3dy9p3,SpinsFerDayz,2,Mon Jul 20 23:12:13 2015 UTC,I went to a festival concert in June. I tried to figure out that same thing but security was pretty tight around the stage... Good luck! Let us know what happens!

ModestMouse,3e04x4,gcola12,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:02 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be offensive, but it sounds like they are making fun of the song."
ModestMouse,3e04x4,MsMagee,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:03 2015 UTC,No not at all. Its actually a tribute. It's just a bluegrass banjo cover. They do a lot of other artists also. I think it's unique and fun.
ModestMouse,3e04x4,NGMCR,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"These guys are fun.  They aren't supposed to BE, MM but they are a kick."

I got absolutely bashed for saying I think this album is terrible. Maybe it's just hipsters or something. This album is a bad tribute. Lyric censoring & soul-crushing. Not only is it a bad  tribute to MM, its also just a lackluster bluegrass album as a whole"
ModestMouse,3dztu4,Cry_ery_tyme,5,Mon Jul 20 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"They have been touring hard all spring/summer.  I bet they are tired, also I bet playing at festivals suck.   If they play at a stand alone concert they know the audience is packed with fans.  At these festivals who knows who is out there."
ModestMouse,3dztu4,CanoeShoes,3,Tue Jul 21 00:19:03 2015 UTC,"From the looks of the set list they weren't given a very large amount of time for their set. Some festivals are like that, and when you have as big of a catalogue to play from as MM and fans wanting so many it can be difficult to meet All expectations with the time constraints placed on them."
ModestMouse,3dztu4,Hissmam,4,Tue Jul 21 02:50:12 2015 UTC,No not at all. It was hot as hell and they were probably exhausted from their tour. I had a blast. That show alone was worth the trip. Oh man. I lost my shit when they played spitting venom. And when Isaac walked of stage at the end of tiny cities for like 2 minutes to inhale a cigarette then comes back out screaming into his guitar. Of man. I still can't process everything that happened. I'm more that happy with the show. Plus in a festival setting they are pretty pressed for time. I'd rather them say as little as possible so we can hear as many songs as possible. AND THEY FINISHED WITH SHIT LUCK?!? Like I don't even. The crowd went nuts.
ModestMouse,3dztu4,Khaga,4,Tue Jul 21 15:11:04 2015 UTC,"Yea idk what OP is talking about, seen em 3 times and 2 were full sets in venues. Any band is going to be restricted at fest shows and I still liked them here better than some of the venue ones. We got styrofoam boots shit luck and Dramamine in the same set at a festival. Are you kidding me? That made my life. They were bringing it from the get-go and I don't see how anyone who was there could think differently."
ModestMouse,3dztu4,thatsabadkitty,3,Tue Jul 21 17:56:44 2015 UTC,the energy was so good. maybe it was just me but i feel like the crowd went the hardest during their show out of all the shows that i saw that weekend. everyone was just belting lyrics out and having a blast. im so glad i went and cant wait to see them again.

The last word seems to be Eric didn't want to comment and Jer said in an interview Eric got tired of touring and wanted to spend more time with his kids. Isaac speculated in a few interviews that Eric was probably sick of dealing with himself (Isaac) personally.
ModestMouse,3dvyad,Right_All_The_Time,8,Mon Jul 20 00:12:09 2015 UTC,ah. yeah ive always envisioned isaac as being a difficult guy to work with. well god bless eric. hopefully he'll do some collab tracks one day or maybe just not be a touring member but someone who can occasionally add his brilliance to this band.
ModestMouse,3dvyad,sky4,5,Mon Jul 20 00:13:54 2015 UTC,Awesome bassist.. He put his time in though. It's great he can spend time with his family.
ModestMouse,3dvyad,Droooops,3,Mon Jul 20 02:04:37 2015 UTC,I follow him on Instagram. He only posts something once every like 4 months. But as /u/Right_All_The_Time said he just wanted to spend more time with his kids.
ModestMouse,3dvyad,Right_All_The_Time,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:12:50 2015 UTC,What's his handle on Instagram?
ModestMouse,3dvyad,Droooops,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"judyericseattle Jeremiah's is sluglife ..he is much more active.  I guess it's worth noting Brock's is just ibrock, but the profile is defunct."

ModestMouse,3dvyad,Right_All_The_Time,0,Tue Jul 21 04:12:20 2015 UTC,Cute kids. Yeah I don't really blame him for wanting to spend more time with them.
ModestMouse,3dvyad,maxwellsearcy,2,Mon Jul 20 15:45:13 2015 UTC,The show I saw yesterday really put it in perspective for me that the new lineup is handling his departure well. The things they're doing to jam on some of the classic Eric Judy basslines like Tiny Cities?! Amazing.
ModestMouse,3dtcoh,justaboxinacage,10,Sun Jul 19 06:55:22 2015 UTC,"Saw them on this tour in Columbus. Drove from mid-Michigan to see it as it was the closest place they were playing. So unbelievably good, and this medley was the PERFECT way to end it. Also, a really hot chicks boob fell out next to me, so that was nice."
ModestMouse,3dtcoh,eatthomaspaine,6,Sun Jul 19 11:27:16 2015 UTC,"This was... just so fucking incredible. I'm nearly speechless. Isaac's raspy whispering of I Came As A Rat.. my god.. and then when it picked back up, ahhh. And the crowd was amazing too, they shouted at all the perfect moments. Thank you sooo much or sharing this."
ModestMouse,3dtcoh,deadkathy,3,Sun Jul 19 09:30:41 2015 UTC,still listening. reminds me of good old mm. probably because it is. i actually loved the WWD era. people dont like that cd. ive listened to MM since 2000 and i enjoyed WWD a fuckin' lot. this is good shit. reminds me of that truckers atlas jam ...or this one i should say https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3SAui320L8
ModestMouse,3dtcoh,raining_picnic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:44:58 2015 UTC,"Meh. I've been a fan for most of my life and there's fans that have some reason or another to bitch with every album. I remember the people saying they got too full of themselves with M&A, ""over-produced"". They said they sold out with Good News. Went off the deep end with WWD. Over produced again with Strangers. It's all noise. All the albums need to grow on most people, then they become classics. It's happened every time."
ModestMouse,3dtcoh,TrueBlue224,2,Mon Jul 20 04:25:50 2015 UTC,Yesssss. It's awesome. It's so quiet and chill.

ModestMouse,3dt72k,trashrabbits,7,Sun Jul 19 05:34:25 2015 UTC,They were fucking amazing. Hell of a performer
ModestMouse,3dt72k,I_CAN_SMELL_U,4,Sun Jul 19 05:43:52 2015 UTC,Whoever had the Custom Concern sign must have felt like the coolest person there. I was stunned when they actually played it for their encore.
ModestMouse,3dt72k,8-bitCowboy,4,Sun Jul 19 09:13:37 2015 UTC,"That was me! :D I was so blown away when they played it, although I'm sad they never acknowledged the side with the picture of a Baby Blue Sedan. But after a show like that, it's hard to be disappointed about anything"
ModestMouse,3dt72k,13ANiSH,2,Sun Jul 19 19:09:01 2015 UTC,"DID NOT get the Baby Blue Sedan reference! I took it simply as a reference to ""This is a long drive for Someone with Nothing to Think about."" I wonder if the band got it. In any case, props for getting them to play one of their best and most classic early songs! That really made the show feel special!"

ModestMouse,3db9ge,Evan1337,17,Wed Jul 15 02:03:46 2015 UTC,Teeth Like God's Shoeshine. It exemplifies all that MM is known for in one song. What this guy said.

That being said, I'd pick from this list: Teeth Like God's Shoeshine, Edit the Sad Parts,  Baby Blue Sedan, Grey Ice Water, Cowboy Dan (maybe my top choice just because I've never met someone that didn't like this song), Styrofoam Boots, 3rd Planet, The Stars Are Projectors, Night On the Sun, Parting of the Sensory, Spitting Venom, Pups to Dust, or Shit in Your Cut.  I'm avoiding all of Good News in that list because I'm assuming if they're buffs and appreciate Indie they already know that album inside and out.

ModestMouse,3db9ge,comfort_eagle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:20:21 2015 UTC,This is trick but I would choose either parting of the sensory or spitting venom.  Not because they're both long though that does have a part.  Both songs go through a simple beginning and end up at a chaotic ending yet beautiful at the same time.

ModestMouse,3dae6k,MsMagee,2,Mon Jul 20 03:50:12 2015 UTC,Oh yeah? Any examples?
ModestMouse,3dae6k,bebopott,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:41:14 2015 UTC,"Sure! God, I hadn't thought about this for a few years.  Yeah, I used to think that in Baby Blue Sedan he was actually talking about a previous love whose name was Henry.  I guess I was mostly projecting my own coming out experience through Brock's own melancholia for urban expansion.  Other examples, ""Working on Leaving the Living"" was a lyrical mantra in convincing myself that coming out was necessary and that eventually ""everything would be alright.""    This is awfully much more personal than I intended it to be.  But I guess my own personal rage of even having to ""come out"" was always at the core of what I heard in his lyrics--An anguish of even having to justify one's own personal life.   In college there was a jerk from the marines who liked to bully the fuck out of the fact that I was in the humanities department.  Totally immature dickwad.  So one day a buddy of mine jokingly left a quote from ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes"" on my door, and the residence assistant surely thought it was the bully after me again.  Specifically it was ""I'm going to hit you on your face, I'm going to punch you in your glasses.""  Since then, the lyric kinda stuck with me.    Lastly, in ""Lounge"" the This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing To Think About version, the repeated verse in convincing himself that he now has a girlfriend from the city always seemed so fitting for a case of the closeted denial.  I guess I can't point to anything truly specific aside than from an intentional misinterpretation.    And yeah, a bear kinda guy too."
ModestMouse,3dae6k,MsMagee,2,Tue Jul 21 06:06:20 2015 UTC,"Regarding your ""Issue"" with Inline image 3:  I see it quite differently.  When he pulls out the sapling at the end, is not intended to indicate him being the Savior of the Sapling.  Rather, if you watch carefully his scepter has changed multiple times from the Genesis part of the video [the beginning] to the murder of the Tie King.  Even the light bulb scepter itself goes through a devolving process.  So, in Greed, he ultimately first murders the Tie King, and then destroys the, now last, sapling and uses it as his final scepter. The last short finds him claiming Dominance over a plundered and destroyed world.  So when he pulls the sapling out at the end, it is taking you full circle from the Genesis of the growing sapling, through, to the jealous desire to own and control all, and ultimately the Disintegrated, Ruined and Used Up World of the same forest we saw in its infancy during the Genesis portion.    I guess  that there are likely as many interpretations as there are people who have watched the video."
ModestMouse,3dae6k,MsMagee,2,Thu Jul 16 00:00:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure why everyone else is hating, but I loved reading this! I had so many issues with the video that I couldn't put into words and you've done that perfectly here!   Visually I enjoy the video, but conceptually I just felt it was so messy. The abrupt intro was honestly my favorite part of the whole thing."

ModestMouse,3d678o,Jimmyjames4,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:05:15 2015 UTC,Coheed and Cambria are very good. The vocalist may take some getting used to though.
ModestMouse,3d678o,gustr15,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:46:26 2015 UTC,Any tips on what I should start with? Or are their albums relatively good/similar?
ModestMouse,3d678o,Jimmyjames4,2,Tue Jul 14 13:23:32 2015 UTC,The first three are my favourites. Start with In Keeping Secrets and then try Second Stage and Good Apollo
ModestMouse,3d678o,gustr15,2,Tue Jul 14 13:31:05 2015 UTC,Thanks!
ModestMouse,3d678o,Jimmyjames4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:26:25 2015 UTC,In keeping secrets is their best imo but id say start with good apollo. Easiest to get into.   Actually fuck it. Listen to the new album. The Afterman. It's amazing.

ModestMouse,3d678o,PREPAREyourANGUS,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:54:43 2015 UTC,It wasn't at Xfest in San Diego back in June. They played 10 songs. I've seen MM live two times in my life and I would recommned to NOT see them at any festival. My friend also went to see them at Cochella a couple years back and they cut them off in the middle of Float On cause they were playing too long.   EDIT: They were given 55minutes at Xfest in SD and they were THE headliner..
ModestMouse,3d678o,bwatters,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"Go on setlist.fm and look at the sets for the festival shows. Theyll probably get an hour and play 12 or 14 songs. They will DEFINITELY play dashboard, lampshades, ocean breathes or world at large, float on, dark center and/or tiny cities, cockroach, and ground walks/best room/ or tortoise. The other songs they play will be up in the air.  You MIGHT get night on the sun. Theyll probably close with good times, different city or something different! Don't expect an encore."
ModestMouse,3d678o,antemasque1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:03:28 2015 UTC,Well I looked at the set list for that show last year and they gave Weezer 18 songs. I just can't figure out if it's Modest Mouse or Rise Against that's going to get the most time
ModestMouse,3d678o,Life_of_Arctic_Sound,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:20:15 2015 UTC,I went to Edgefest last year and Weezer played for about 2 hours and Brand New played for probably an hour and a half. So it all depends if Modest Mouse is headlining or Rise Against.

ModestMouse,3d0e8o,Jame_Jameson,7,Sun Jul 12 13:06:53 2015 UTC,One of my favorites as well. This version gives me chills.
ModestMouse,3d0e8o,pm_me_some_pancakes,6,Sun Jul 12 15:18:47 2015 UTC,It's definitely the added violin that just escalates it for me. I'd love for them to re-release this in studio with the extra strings. I really love the extended version of Blame It On The Tetons because of that reason
ModestMouse,3d0e8o,bimmyoftheages,3,Sun Jul 12 16:09:26 2015 UTC,"I had never heard this song before just now, mostly because I've always just stuck to their actual studio album releases, seems like I've made a bit of a mistake."
ModestMouse,3d0e8o,suspensionodisbelief,2,Sun Jul 12 20:37:21 2015 UTC,That album (Building Nothing out of Something) is great. If you don't want to listen to it all from the get go check out specifically tracks 3 / 6/ 7 (this song lol)/ 11/ & 12. But believe me it's all worth it.
ModestMouse,3d0e8o,TheBashfulPanda,3,Sun Jul 12 23:16:31 2015 UTC,Cool version.  The video description comment made me cringe though.

It is so disappointing and frustrating to look forward to a show and the sound is dreadful. If they can send a man to the moon why is this still such an issue? It has actually led me to see a lot fewer shows. Why spend a shit load of money to be disappointed .

Australopithecus (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX4sS5ks18I) -- I wish there was one more verse, to at least get a full repetition of the first few lines ""... friend to the end but it's over, over...""  The first half of Space Travel is Boring (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmmtkOPGMj8) -- The second half is fine. The first half is fantastic but short.  The part of Blame it on the Tetons (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1UzPkkuOtU) with the piano, near the end (about 4:30 in).  The last minute of Grey Ice Water (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErPqjCGpqu0) (from about 4:15) -- This is the 45-second section that repeats ""On the arctic glass"" after the snare drum drops out."
ModestMouse,3cuvs2,Dastraussiv,2,Sun Jul 12 22:31:43 2015 UTC,"The part of Blame it on the Tetons... The last minute of Grey Ice Water     I agree with all the songs you linked, but I've thought the exact same thing about these two for so long. I frequently play just that one part of Blame it on the Tetons through the end. I think it annoys my gf."
ModestMouse,3cuvs2,wormyrocks,2,Mon Jul 13 03:50:14 2015 UTC,I hear you. Sometimes I play Blue Cadet 3 on repeat to sort of approximate a longer version.

ModestMouse,3cm3t8,ajdj99,3,Thu Jul 9 07:38:01 2015 UTC,"My first time seeing Modest Mouse too, I enjoyed the hell out of it. Setlist could have been more tailored specifically for me, (add Gravity Rides, Doin the Cockroach and Spittin Venom and it'd be pretty much spot on though) but that's always going to happen.  And I got my favourite song, Cowboy Dan, so I wouldn't dream of complaining (if anyone is still pissed off at the loudmouth Australian cunt who got way too excited when Cowboy Dan started, I apologise profusely.)   Side note, it was also my first time seeing a show in England, are the crowds always so seemingly uninterested in what's on stage? I saw probably less than 10 people aside from me moving about most of the time, and a lot of crossed arms and blank expressions."
ModestMouse,3cm3t8,JoeCallon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:49:39 2015 UTC,"The crowd was absoloutely awful, people were throwing half empty cups in front of them, smoking 24/7, moving around and pushing people out the way during songs. The guy right of me started telling a joke to his friend during the cowboy dan breakdown. At least they were loud and there was certainly an atmosphere."
ModestMouse,3cm3t8,gobeye,2,Thu Jul 9 11:23:26 2015 UTC,"Wow, that sounds awful. I didn't notice any smoking outside of the passout smoking area, throwing cups, or talking during songs, but any of that would have put a damper on my night."

ModestMouse,3cjacv,ugly-casanova,2,Sat Jul 11 21:43:32 2015 UTC,I personally was really satisfied with the setlist. Sure I wish they had played Dramamine or something else from that album but overall the song choices were pretty good. Bukowski was played so that makes me v. happy and the fact that they ended the whole thing with Sugar Boats (which is my fav song from the new album) made the whole thing even more special.  Sound was not a problem for me but that might have been because I was right in the front so I heard them perfectly. Hope to see them again in the future :D
ModestMouse,3cjacv,DemonsInTheDesign,2,Thu Jul 9 12:19:45 2015 UTC,I was right in the front too! Got there 40min before doors opened but it was still pretty empty at 7 lol. I think the sound could have been better but I don't think it was terrible - and I loved the setlist. I know people love to hate on Good News and We Were Dead but I still really like those albums.
ModestMouse,3cjacv,MsMagee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:43:27 2015 UTC,"Aw man that's wicked! I was the girl with glasses, ponytail and dressed in a grey shirt. If you ever noticed someone like that even.  Yeah it was pretty empty till about 8 or 9 but I guess everyone was there for Modest Mouse rather than he two opening bands.   Speaking of the people from the front -was it me or most of those who were lucky enough to catch the front seemed to be very quiet for the entire thing?? I was expecting them to be more excited. The people behind us were dancing and screaming but front people..not so much. Very odd!"
ModestMouse,3cjacv,DaleGribble23,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:19:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I noticed that as well, one girl in the row of people behind looked like she was having the time of her life but people on the front were doing naff all.

ModestMouse,3cjacv,Phnxhdsn,4,Thu Jul 9 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"I thought the set list was poor. I thought the sound was poor, couldn't hear vocals, couldn't even hear Isaacs talking between songs.  I had high hopes from reading prior set lists,  but nothing at all off LCW and so few off any of their best albums."
ModestMouse,3cjacv,DemonsInTheDesign,2,Wed Jul 8 15:30:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the sound. The sound guy didn't even seem to be paying attention half the time. I noticed Isaac miming ""more vocals"" to him at one point, but he was looking somewhere else entirely. I think he was staring blankly at the drummers or something at that point. Then later on he mimed for more backing vocals for Lisa, sound guy wasn't even at his desk at that point."
ModestMouse,3cjacv,Fointy_Pinger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:20:47 2015 UTC,"Do they have their own sound guy, or do they use the sound techs from the venues they play?"

ModestMouse,3cjacv,MsMagee,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:13:54 2015 UTC,That sounds like the Chicago incident when his jaw was broken by the kids in the park near where MM was recording.  He had his jaw wired that time. This happened in UK in 2007 I think _so more than 5 years ago. They played a number of shows before he finally had to call it and have surgery to repair the damage.  I truly hope he didn't get hit again on this trip...  He may have been talking about it because I'm sure the memory of it has stuck with him. It's a wonder he can still sing after so many face beatings!
ModestMouse,3cjacv,MsMagee,2,Wed Jul 8 17:34:55 2015 UTC,Yeah it was May 2007. I saw them at the Ritz then and Isaac was wearing an eye patch. I think it happened in Birmingham? I met the band after the gig and got a pic with him...cropped myself out here though! http://i.imgur.com/upqQbPq.jpgl?sort=3&o=0
ModestMouse,3cfo8e,Maplemore,6,Tue Jul 7 15:29:58 2015 UTC,"Apparently opening up for them is Gene Ween. Whether you'll regret missing him is a separate story.  Actually, knowing that might've made me buy a ticket. I've seen Modest Mouse twice in the past year, but never anyone from Ween. Too bad that now I can't make it, so I even can't stubhub a ticket. :("

ModestMouse,3cfo8e,Shiningtoast,6,Tue Jul 7 18:09:08 2015 UTC,"They are always late. Always. I've seen them 3 times and they were almost an hour late every time. The last time I saw them, Isaac talked about how every day when he wakes up, he thinks ""We are going to be on stage late tonight"".   So for example, the last time I saw them, doors were at 7:30, opener was at 8. MM was supposed to start at 9. It was almost 10 before they got on stage."
ModestMouse,3cfo8e,NEOOMGGeeWhiz,3,Tue Jul 7 17:16:04 2015 UTC,"In Manchester tonight they took stage about 2 hours after doors opened. That 2 hours was for the 2 supporting acts & setup time.  Also most people only got there about an hour and a half after doors opened, I guess they weren't interested in watching the supporting acts"
ModestMouse,3cfo8e,Bearmodulate,2,Tue Jul 7 23:42:18 2015 UTC,You'll be fine even if there isn't an opening band. In general most bands don't take the stage until 30-40 minutes after when the ticket says they will.   You might miss the first song or two but it won't be terrible
ModestMouse,3cfo8e,cowboy_danMM,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:14:54 2015 UTC,"If you mean an hour or so after the ticket says the show starts, you will not miss Mouse. Their openers typically play 30-45 minutes, and then Mouse usually takes the stage 45 minutes-1 hour after that."

I don't mind them being late, but I do wish they'd play longer sets to make up for it. I spent 4 hours in the rain and still was pretty far back from the stage, so that part was kinda annoying. So I wouldn't worry about being an hour late. You probably won't miss anything."
ModestMouse,3ce0bm,catfaic,6,Tue Jul 7 04:24:37 2015 UTC,"If I'm remembering correctly the LCW and Long Drive records were reissued at the same time.   My guess is that someone dun goofed at the pressing plant and the pressing plates got mixed up. I'm sure more than one was pressed like that before it was noticed, and yours most likely slipped through quality control. Probably not exceptionally valuable, but interesting for sure.   I would shoot Glacial Pace an email, no doubt they would replace it for you for free."
ModestMouse,3ce0bm,Shiningtoast,0,Tue Jul 7 05:39:59 2015 UTC,i had just boughten LCW and M&A on vinyl and both skipped terribly brand new out of the packaging. swapped my moon vinyl and havent tested it yet but the LCW they didnt have another of so instead i got like 35 in credit. i think theyre having a hard time with these pressings. i heard theres like 2 companies or something that makes all the records for the US so its not unheard of with the speeds they have to try to produce them at

ModestMouse,3cavfg,vighhiolet,4,Mon Jul 6 13:52:06 2015 UTC,"Here is what I read by Andrew Almond from Gigwise. "" Modest Mouse, had by frontman Isaac Brock’s admission been “liberated from their equipment”. Whether this meant that they’d had it nicked, it hadn’t arrived on site, or something other wasn’t explained but regardless the band pulled in a large crowd and played a competent set.""  Too bad.  I hope it is found or returned, that would be hard to deal with at any time.  Edit: sounds like it was stuck in France.*"
ModestMouse,3cavfg,MsMagee,2,Mon Jul 6 14:23:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was there, Isaac for the small bit that he actually talked said at the start about not being able to use his own instruments or something and seemed very grumpy :(,  they played a lot of mainstream songs as they aren't as known in the UK which was slightly disappointing too so they seemed mediocre following a great performance from The Hives cause I was at the very front for both!"
ModestMouse,3cavfg,Phnxhdsn,2,Mon Jul 6 15:34:15 2015 UTC,Yeh he seemed pretty agitated the whole show- I would be too given the circumstances. I'm just gutted that that's London show. I don't understand why they're not doing a proper show.
ModestMouse,3cavfg,Phnxhdsn,2,Mon Jul 6 19:23:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm gutted that that was the first time I've seen them live and it was rather disappointing compared to what I've seen of their live shows, who knows, is a shame."
ModestMouse,3cavfg,timetobenice,2,Mon Jul 6 20:00:51 2015 UTC,"I was there. I absolutely love Modest Mouse, but I was disappointed by the set too. I'm from Seattle and I've only lived in London for 7 months, so I have to ask: are most festival audiences that humdrum, or is it just because Modest Mouse is much less popular here than in their hometown? I hopped over to the stage with Bleachers afterward and there wasn't much excitement there either, but I didn't stay much longer."
ModestMouse,3cavfg,Phnxhdsn,3,Mon Jul 6 19:15:33 2015 UTC,"People were pumped for The Hives and I assume Noel Gallagher but yeah Modest Mouse are barely known in the UK. Yeah me and my girlfriend went home at like 7ish too, oh well."
ModestMouse,3cavfg,sterance,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:03:57 2015 UTC,"I considered going, but I didn't and it sounds like a good call. I'd only have been going to see them, so I'm really disappointed that not only was this their only London show, but  also their only show in the south of the UK. A few years ago I missed out on tickets to see them here in Brighton and was secretly relieved when they cancelled the tour - I suppose I naively assumed they'd re-book the same venues when they eventually got back on the road. Humph."

ModestMouse,3c8gcd,daebat,2,Sun Jul 5 21:49:14 2015 UTC,"Essentially what I do is I take high quality versions of a track, separate the left and right channels and convert them to mono. I then invert one side and then recombine the two tracks and what happens is that frequencies that were the same between the two left and right channels cancel each other out and expose other sounds you might not have heard. I did this for the entire album so if you all like these I can upload more."

ModestMouse,3c0ify,Izonus,8,Fri Jul 3 19:15:34 2015 UTC,"The closest thing that i've heard where Isaac has a style like that through the album is Good News, so you should compile all the songs together for her. But some of them, (aka float on and all the other softer songs) so you should probably include Bury Me With it and cut out all the other ones that don't fit the standard. Jesus Christ Was an Only Child, in a way, fits the style but pretty inconsistent-like. Doin the cockroach is a pretty good candidate I think. Cowboy Dan, Teeth Like God's Shoeshine, Beach Side Property. beach side has a pretty good flow of the angst in isaac's younger voice, which is what i think you're looking for, but it breaks off here and there for a little bit. Edit the Sad Parts is lyrically powerful and has a good consistency on that voice strain that isaac is pretty well known for."

ModestMouse,3bv7bp,perfekt_disguize,4,Thu Jul 2 18:48:30 2015 UTC,People tend to confuse the word retiring as a synonym for giving up on life.

ModestMouse,3bv7bp,Jcbhnn,0,Fri Jul 3 05:47:35 2015 UTC,"Haha oh come on, I've lived in both Portland and Denton, and my best friend lives in Austin. Denton is no where near as bad as either of those places. I absolutely love it here because it like the other two cities in view but still has the texas charm and small ish town vibe. I like to think that if ft worth and Austin had a baby it would be Denton."
ModestMouse,3bv7bp,bzsteele,10,Fri Jul 3 04:43:00 2015 UTC,"I love Isaac interviews. Haha. Interviewers never have any idea what they're getting in to, and Isaac can ramble on about nothing and go off topic while somehow remaining on topic for so long.   So funny."

ModestMouse,3bv7bp,HolyFiloni,3,Thu Jul 2 16:01:16 2015 UTC,As a Portland resident for 17 years I agree with Isaac completely. It is a fun place to visit but I am totally completely over living here. And it is ridiculously expensive.

There was a bearded drag queen in a bar who looked like the bassist He has bathroom mats onstage because he messed up his back from years of touring.   At least I think that's what he said!  They also did a small bit of a Beat Happening song (don't know which one though, sorry) somewhere towards the end of the set. Maybe before Ansel?"

Going solo though like OP, just can't get my friends into them :/  I was just wondering about this too, when are you guys thinking of getting in line? I don't really want to be standing outside for hours beforehand, but I don't want to end up stuck at the back unable to see anything for the show either! Now I also don't know how popular they really are in the UK, so I don't know if it will be a ""get there super early and queue for hours"" or a ""stroll in as the support takes to the stage and get a drink"" kind of deal.   (As another thought, do you know who the support are?)"

About arriving there, I arrived for doors last time there wasn't much of a long queue and they had a support as well.

I've never heard of either of them so I guess I've got some listening to do!  Thanks for the tip on doors. I guess I'll get there a bit before, but not too early. Probably go for a couple pints elsewhere before or something.   Oh it's also apparently sold out now, which is cool!"

ModestMouse,3bw8s8,brtt150,0,Fri Jul 3 02:30:06 2015 UTC,mp3 isn't a high quality format so upconverting it wouldn't maintain any of that.
ModestMouse,3bw8s8,kurtless,5,Fri Jul 3 13:33:30 2015 UTC,You don't understand. Audio CDs aren't mp3s. You can rip them to .wav for lossless audio. It's not upconverting anything.  Edit: I just realized you assumed I meant to buy a digital copy. I'm talking about an actual CD.
ModestMouse,3bw8s8,kurtless,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:38:03 2015 UTC,I did mean digital but I honestly did not know that you could rip wav from a cd. Thanks for the info!

I just heard this on the radio like 10 min ago and it sounded like a club mix and it irritated me that the radio has to change music like this.

You've got different ""rulers"" with different crowns, horns, keys, colander, forks, bits of metal, etc. fighting over a little tree growing in their world of garbage. I wasn't 100% until the Mountain reference at the end with the eye/skull crush, but that seals the deal for me. Trailer Trash Westeros. imo."
ModestMouse,3br5ee,MsMagee,3,Thu Jul 2 03:19:44 2015 UTC,Isaac wearing furs and scrap metal with a god damn scepter adorned with a broken light bulb. Russel sporting a golden crown of dirty keys. Jeremiah rocking a crown of forks with a tablecloth headdress. And Jim Fairchild: the Angel of Plastic Bags.    Excellent.
ModestMouse,3br5ee,Melleh17,3,Thu Jul 2 05:51:04 2015 UTC,Did you notice the scepter changes three times as the song progresses from the genesis phase to the murder?
ModestMouse,3br5ee,thismadhatter,2,Thu Jul 2 05:56:32 2015 UTC,"The first one looks like a mushroom, then there's the flashes of him looking like he's tripping.... then it's a knife. Interesting. Good call."
ModestMouse,3br5ee,MsMagee,2,Thu Jul 2 23:06:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, after the organic mushroom/root,  it's a light bulb that gradually gets more and more broken, then the knife and ultimately, after the murder, he pulls out the last remaining sapling and uses it as his triumphant scepter.  This video is so packet with metaphors.   edited for typo"
ModestMouse,3br5ee,spork_br,3,Fri Jul 3 03:06:57 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, frightened and aroused"
ModestMouse,3br5ee,tinylaugh,2,Thu Jul 2 06:16:32 2015 UTC,Man this is their best video yet.
ModestMouse,3br5ee,some1onredditsaidit,2,Wed Jul 1 19:42:21 2015 UTC,holy shit.    Spot On
ModestMouse,3br5ee,MsMagee,2,Wed Jul 1 20:29:02 2015 UTC,Wonder if Isaac came up with the concept..  It's strange and artsy and Isaac in gold booty shorts.. I loved every minute of it!
ModestMouse,3br5ee,gtnover,2,Thu Jul 2 00:34:10 2015 UTC,"Fantastic! Insane King Isaac defeats the tie monster in an Oregonian clear cut wasteland. The Modest Mousiest thing ever. Also, it looks like he's singing into a morel mushroom."
ModestMouse,3br5ee,FPE-Locke,2,Thu Jul 2 01:56:54 2015 UTC,"My favorite part is where Isaac is saying ""the part of the ground,"" etc. in normal clothes and with a smile, like it was taken from some kind of audition."
ModestMouse,3br5ee,ItsFromMars,6,Thu Jul 2 02:52:46 2015 UTC,"Yes! that part was all the creepier because of the sweet, sincere look on his face."
ModestMouse,3br5ee,Bazzcry,2,Thu Jul 2 03:04:51 2015 UTC,Why do they cut the best part of the song out?????????
ModestMouse,3br5ee,seaseme,2,Thu Jul 2 03:13:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people are saying Game of Thrones.  Probably because they have short memories.  What Isaac does to Danger Ehren is actually what Roy Batty does to Dr. Tyrell in Blade Runner.  The Moon & Antarctica was named after a forgettable, minor line from that movie, so it's clear that Isaac is a huge fan."
ModestMouse,3bs4ou,fokerpace2000,2,Wed Jul 1 18:29:39 2015 UTC,I got Kirby's!
ModestMouse,3bs4ou,Poke-hey-mon,2,Thu Jul 2 00:09:24 2015 UTC,I think I got russel/Lisa's. Not sure but stage dude seemed to rip it up from that area
ModestMouse,3bs4ou,blackhawk-846,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:07:10 2015 UTC,What do the little numbers and letters next to the song names mean?
ModestMouse,3bs4ou,Novocain-Stain,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:25:28 2015 UTC,"Wild guess is that they play some songs differently live, depending on the setup."
ModestMouse,3bs4ou,jacktree,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:33:20 2015 UTC,Didnt play Different City though and Ground Walks was the encore. Sick show though!
ModestMouse,3bslrz,monaks,3,Wed Jul 1 20:30:24 2015 UTC,"They've been playing in Europe lately, so the opener is probably different. They'll probably announce the opener for St. Augustine in the next week or so, and it'll probably be a Glacial Pace band.  Personally hoping for Mimicking Birds."
ModestMouse,3bslrz,tissin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:50:56 2015 UTC,Haha yes. No doubt I think it'll be a band signed with Glacial Pace. I saw Morning Teleportation last year with MM and Mimicking Birds earlier in March but would love to see Mimicking Birds again
ModestMouse,3bslrz,fokerpace2000,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:53:38 2015 UTC,Thanks Tilly for the update
ModestMouse,3bslrz,Tweek444,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"In Europe they have World Gang opening up, which apparently is   Jeremiah's side project. I can't find much info on 'em other than this Soundcloud."
ModestMouse,3bslrz,tynamite,2,Thu Jul 2 08:27:34 2015 UTC,Did they have Jeremiah play during the opening act? That's crazy to play two shows back to back.
ModestMouse,3bslrz,Tweek444,2,Tue Jul 7 17:08:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah but they're an electronic act so they were just playing synths and drum-machines. It was really cool and weird though, they both stayed under these space blankets for the entire show."
ModestMouse,3bslrz,tynamite,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:52:41 2015 UTC,Oh it's a two piece band? That's cool. I'll have to check them out.
ModestMouse,3boa4i,daebat,8,Tue Jun 30 20:31:33 2015 UTC,Whoa.  Colour me impressed.
ModestMouse,3boa4i,ShawnisMaximus,2,Tue Jun 30 20:58:23 2015 UTC,I know! They go together nicely.
ModestMouse,3boa4i,modestrat,7,Tue Jun 30 21:08:00 2015 UTC,These album concept photos are a nice coincidence.
ModestMouse,3boa4i,welldon3_st3ak,2,Tue Jun 30 22:41:14 2015 UTC,Who are half those people in the mm one?
ModestMouse,3boa4i,0piat3,2,Tue Jun 30 23:28:41 2015 UTC,real talk
ModestMouse,3boa4i,TyrannosaurusMax,3,Sat Jul 4 16:36:49 2015 UTC,The two songs worked extremely well together. Very impressive
ModestMouse,3boa4i,NeighborhoodTunnels,3,Tue Jun 30 22:12:36 2015 UTC,"Damn, I was not expecting this to be so good. Amazing job."
ModestMouse,3boa4i,_Tundra_Boy_,4,Tue Jun 30 22:47:59 2015 UTC,OMG. I fucking love grizzly bear. And fleet foxes. And wolf parade. Lots of animal themed bands  This is freaking awesome. I love whoever made this
ModestMouse,3boa4i,ghost_victim,4,Wed Jul 1 02:45:12 2015 UTC,Well that was fucking awesome. Good job on the vocals for Two Weeks.
ModestMouse,3boa4i,MisterPee,3,Wed Jul 1 05:33:40 2015 UTC,That was awesome. Two great songs individually and surprisingly great together. I don't know how many times I've heard those songs and would have never thought to put them together.
ModestMouse,3boa4i,ThePlatypusSays,2,Tue Jun 30 23:56:36 2015 UTC,FanFuckingTastic!
ModestMouse,3bml15,TwoOneEyedDogs,17,Tue Jun 30 13:00:40 2015 UTC,"""Encore"""
ModestMouse,3bml15,perfekt_disguize,17,Tue Jun 30 15:17:01 2015 UTC,"Scream ""shit luck"" as loud as u can"
ModestMouse,3bml15,laidgoose,9,Tue Jun 30 14:32:23 2015 UTC,"Just make noise, as long as the crowd shows some enthusiasm they'll probably be back out."
ModestMouse,3bml15,collisions,2,Tue Jun 30 13:17:54 2015 UTC,Oh trust me ill make noise :D thank you :)
ModestMouse,3bml15,MsMagee,2,Tue Jun 30 14:23:22 2015 UTC,"Make noise, but just don't be upset if it is at a Festival rather than a venue and they don't come back. It is only because of the time constrains that swampsounds referred to."
ModestMouse,3bml15,Coleslaw19438,12,Tue Jun 30 18:37:48 2015 UTC,Just scream freebird at the top of your lungs.
ModestMouse,3bml15,panzerfausten,5,Tue Jun 30 16:55:36 2015 UTC,huehuehuehue
ModestMouse,3bml15,Mister_Misnomer,2,Tue Jun 30 18:28:58 2015 UTC,DESTINY'S CHILD!
ModestMouse,3bml15,NGMCR,2,Wed Jul 1 03:55:12 2015 UTC,Life's too fuckin short to hear or play Freebird
ModestMouse,3bml15,swampsounds,3,Wed Jul 15 13:38:17 2015 UTC,"If you're seeing them at a festival, its more than likely they they wont play an encore. Its just festival etiquette, the acts are all under heavy time constraints. If they're playing a venue, you should just should whatever, untill they come back on."
ModestMouse,3bml15,Archaeoculus,3,Tue Jun 30 18:00:41 2015 UTC,"Shout in German. If you're lucky he'll ask what zugabe means and you can tell him, encore!"
ModestMouse,3bml15,conkedup,2,Tue Jun 30 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend screaming ""King Rat"". When I saw him last he was about to go off stage and when I screamed that he said fuck it and played that song. Best concert ever"
ModestMouse,3bml15,JonnyTango,2,Tue Jun 30 18:10:34 2015 UTC,"Hey, are you going to the concert in the Utrecht as well?"
ModestMouse,3bml15,antemasque1,4,Tue Jun 30 22:39:45 2015 UTC,"If they plan an encore, which they usually do, it will happen regardless.   But definitely just shout free bird."
ModestMouse,3bml15,ShawnisMaximus,-4,Tue Jun 30 17:38:29 2015 UTC,"""you guys suck"" usually works."
ModestMouse,3bml15,lsda,5,Tue Jun 30 16:08:40 2015 UTC,He's not seeing primus
ModestMouse,3bp288,BurgersWelldone,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:09:41 2015 UTC,Same here. I need to find out the schedule before I buy a ticket because I'd only be going for MM. And I'm 45 minutes outside Philly.
ModestMouse,3bp288,datkidbrad,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:19:06 2015 UTC,Then why not go both days?  You don't see any other artists you would want to see?
ModestMouse,3bp288,MeanwhileOnReddit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:14:44 2015 UTC,Not enough to justify paying the ticket price/travel costs/beer and food prices.
ModestMouse,3bk900,ZazDupree,2,Mon Jun 29 22:18:26 2015 UTC,I never realized that. I see how the outro reminds you of Trucker's Atlas. They're super long on some songs and serve strong purposes which I love (TA being the feeling of drugs seeming to last forever.)
ModestMouse,3bk900,ZombieSlayerTank,2,Mon Jun 29 23:01:40 2015 UTC,"Take a look at the music video for The Ground Walks, With Time in a Box. It basically confirms what you said."
ModestMouse,3bk900,anyhistoricalfigure,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:16:13 2015 UTC,amazing
ModestMouse,3biyv2,SpinsFerDayz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:44:15 2015 UTC,I'm so shocked there's no hate.
ModestMouse,3biyv2,maxwellsearcy,2,Fri Jul 10 23:28:16 2015 UTC,"Same here, I'm not complaining."
ModestMouse,3bjfhk,jimbojangles1987,4,Mon Jun 29 18:43:58 2015 UTC,"Nothing more needs to be said. Great song. I get extremely sad at ""my daddy quit his job today,  well I guess he was fired but that's okay"" and I am not really sure why :/"
ModestMouse,3bjfhk,gcola12,3,Tue Jun 30 05:19:00 2015 UTC,Will always be my favorite song ever. Saw them in upstate new york last summer and they played this in the pouring rain. Mother fucking glorious.
ModestMouse,3bjfhk,royboyblue,6,Tue Jun 30 17:48:23 2015 UTC,Yeah? What's the point?
ModestMouse,3bjfhk,funran,10,Mon Jun 29 23:09:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean...does there need to be a point?  I was driving this morning and saw a pack of wild dogs crossing the highway, around 10 or so, and I slowed down but the truck next to me didn't and he hit one of the puppies. It was very sad, but it made me think of this song. So, I guess, that's why I posted it.  But really it's just a good song."
ModestMouse,3bjfhk,funran,8,Tue Jun 30 01:51:03 2015 UTC,"You should have told that story with it. Of course it's a good song, but in a sub of MM fans im not sure anyone will be exited to see a youtube link of a well know song and nothing more. There is no supplemental content. The story of course would be that missing content."
ModestMouse,3bjfhk,0piat3,4,Tue Jun 30 02:35:30 2015 UTC,"Ahh, that makes sense. I guess I just figured fans would appreciate the song, especially if they hadn't listened to it in awhile.   But ya, the story along with it gives the post meaning, so I get what you're saying."
ModestMouse,3bkcyn,iamtraviscd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:50:29 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it's a soundboard recording, because quite honestly, the sound wasn't the greatest. It was over-modulating quite a bit at the show.  It still kicked ass, but it would be really nice to hear a soundboard recording of it."
ModestMouse,3bk336,bacomm_,2,Mon Jun 29 21:34:05 2015 UTC,Hey I am!!!!!!!!! = )  So psyched for MM and The Hives its unreal never seen either.
ModestMouse,3bk336,Phnxhdsn,2,Tue Jun 30 21:21:51 2015 UTC,"Same, I'm hyped for both of them, only problem being the sets are only 45 minutes long each, kinda wish it was longer."
ModestMouse,3bk336,Phnxhdsn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:56:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah Just checked the stage listings, yeah I'd rather have 2 hours of Modest Mouse instead of 2 hours of Noel Gallagher but oh well, gotta take Modest Mouse when you can get it in the UK! haha"
ModestMouse,3bdefq,antemasque1,21,Sun Jun 28 04:04:43 2015 UTC,"I was there, and I wish this had been the actual setlist, but someone has been messing with it. My friend got a setlist off stage so I could update this post later with the actual setlist.  edit: here is the setlist. They did not play Be Brave, I Came as a Rat, Doin' the Cockroach and Sugar Boats but they played King Rat, Ocean Breathes Salty and The Ground Walks aswell."
ModestMouse,3bdefq,Marra_marra,2,Sun Jun 28 14:39:08 2015 UTC,please deliver! =] edit: thanks!
ModestMouse,3bdefq,maxwellsearcy,24,Sun Jun 28 14:59:17 2015 UTC,EDIT THE SAD PARTS?
ModestMouse,3bdefq,tissin,10,Sun Jun 28 04:10:43 2015 UTC,And trailer trash...
ModestMouse,3bdefq,NEOOMGGeeWhiz,14,Sun Jun 28 05:17:28 2015 UTC,"Edit the Sad Parts hasn't been play in 20 years, and was only played once Trailer Trash is actually fairly common"
ModestMouse,3bdefq,tissin,7,Sun Jun 28 05:34:38 2015 UTC,"It also says they played Tundra/Desert which hasn't been played in 14 years. If this turns out to be real, holy...  I think editor is trolling, because he also put Dirty Fingernails on there and took it off."
ModestMouse,3bdefq,justaboxinacage,5,Sun Jun 28 06:27:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, and ""A Life of Arctic Sounds,"" which has also been on hiatus since the Good News tour."
ModestMouse,3bdefq,maxwellsearcy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:02:03 2015 UTC,Interesting. Do you mean that the only public release of Edit the Sad Parts we've ever heard is the one on Interstate 8?
ModestMouse,3bdefq,thegreatjaadoo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:47:57 2015 UTC,"That wasn't even a public performance. The ""Live in Sunburst MT"" is actually a demo tape that the band sent to Up Records."
ModestMouse,3bdefq,maxwellsearcy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, iirc, it was recorded in a backyard shed, but it wasn't a ""performance."" Some fans jokingly call it modest mouse's first live show, though.  Edit: the vinyl re-release of I8 is really good, everyone should buy it."
ModestMouse,3bdefq,marumaruko,3,Wed Jul 1 18:38:08 2015 UTC,would have been amazing. It's one of my favourite songs of all times and would die to hear that in Berlin when I see MM for the first time after 7 years (back then in Munich for the We Were Dead tour).
ModestMouse,3bdefq,fokerpace2000,10,Sun Jun 28 19:55:25 2015 UTC,I think someone's fucking with it
ModestMouse,3bdefq,justaboxinacage,7,Sun Jun 28 04:10:49 2015 UTC,All edits by same user. My god what if its true.
ModestMouse,3bdefq,justaboxinacage,4,Sun Jun 28 04:14:08 2015 UTC,"I'm calling B.S., but if it were true, it's one of best set lists I've ever seen. It doesn't have any tracks off We Were Dead. That and because Edit the Sad Parts and a couple other rare songs are on there all together makes me think it's fake."
ModestMouse,3bdefq,gcola12,4,Sun Jun 28 05:49:18 2015 UTC,"Dashboard, yo."
ModestMouse,3bdefq,luftwaffles1337,3,Sun Jun 28 15:48:56 2015 UTC,That was added afterward. How convenient.

ModestMouse,3bdefq,iamtraviscd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:25:19 2015 UTC,it's very wrong  source: was there

ModestMouse,3bdefq,UlyssesTheSloth,3,Mon Jun 29 00:34:18 2015 UTC,I call fake. This setlist is too fucking incredible for even MM to pull off on this tour.
ModestMouse,3bdefq,ClintonHarvey,2,Mon Jun 29 22:52:37 2015 UTC,"""Teeth Like God's Shoeshine"" and it can officially be the best setlist ever"
ModestMouse,3bdefq,justaboxinacage,2,Mon Jun 29 14:04:10 2015 UTC,holy shit this list is legendary. Edit hadn't even been played for like twenty years
ModestMouse,3bdefq,Bill__Buttlicker,2,Mon Jun 29 14:22:55 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, 9, 10, 12, and 13"
ModestMouse,3bdefq,luftwaffles1337,2,Tue Jun 30 03:39:00 2015 UTC,Tundra/Desert and Edit the Sad Parts have both been removed and it still looks kinda fake. Is there anyone on this damn sub that can give us the real scoop?!
ModestMouse,3bclv4,Flambolt,5,Sat Jun 27 23:08:01 2015 UTC,"Drummings a bit sloppy, but overall it's a good cover. You hold the sticks weird as well."

ModestMouse,3b9jq7,Shauncy_,3,Sat Jun 27 02:22:01 2015 UTC,"It looks pretty much like a six point locking tremolo, which come on most strats. The metal piece underneath it though looks like an add on, and since you can bend with it, the piece underneath it kind of makes the bridge a Floyd rose and strat hybrid. It looks pretty cool man."
ModestMouse,3b9jq7,SargeCobra,2,Sat Jun 27 02:50:21 2015 UTC,Ah thats neat! And thank you! Its alot of fun to play on. And it makes playing alot of Modest Mouse songs much easier.
ModestMouse,3b9jq7,ugly-casanova,3,Sat Jun 27 02:52:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a pretty standard 6 point bridge. Do you have it set up to be slightly floating? You'd be able to bend up then."
ModestMouse,3b7m6k,unplacid,10,Fri Jun 26 16:53:06 2015 UTC,Open that shit and spin it
ModestMouse,3b7m6k,TheAllStarrBand,8,Fri Jun 26 17:46:22 2015 UTC,"If it says Matador on the back for the record company, keep it sealed.  If it says Up Records on the back for the record company, I'm not entirely sure if that's the original shrink wrap. Every sealed Up Records copy I've seen has this sticker on the front."
ModestMouse,3b7m6k,Styrofoam--Boots,3,Fri Jun 26 19:27:54 2015 UTC,It's from Up records. I really hope I didn't get ripped off. Here is a picture of the back. caption

I never would have removed the sticker so idk...perhaps it was reshrunkwrapped but i doubt it."
ModestMouse,3b7m6k,Funkbass,6,Sun Jun 28 08:02:30 2015 UTC,"The collector in me says nope, but records were meant to be played. So long as you have a proper setup and care system go for it."

ModestMouse,3b1l4z,Bill__Buttlicker,19,Thu Jun 25 07:25:15 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it's an age thing.  Isaac Brock is 39 now, he was 17 when Modest Mouse first came about, when you're a teenager you're all angsty and rebellious and that's what gives birth to these crazy emotional and dark and weird songs. However then time passes and you grow up and all these teenage issues fade and become irrelevant and your music changes with it, those issues you were always so hung up over as a teenager are irrelevant now and music is now less of ""this band just really describe how I feel inside"" and more ""this band is great, they sound amazing"". People are expecting Isaac, a middle aged man with his life figured out, to put on the mask of a depressed, possibly suicidal, teenage boy, so he can write songs ""like the good older stuff"", and that's just unrealistic. Even if he did manage to it wouldn't sound genuine anyway, the reason it worked so well was because he had an incredibly difficult childhood so these woes were honest and you can hear the genuine emotion in his voice, it wouldn't be the same coming from him now.  Another good example of this is Bright Eyes, they were a hugely important band to me in my teen years and Conor Oberst has followed a similar pattern to Isaac Brock musically in that he released all this crazy emotional stuff when he was young and now he's grown up and it's all a lot safer sounding. I hadn't listened to them for years so I went back through their albums again. Older Bright Eyes stuff meant so much to me when I was 16, it really captured my woes in life etc and will always hold a very special place in my heart, however now I'm older and looking at it objectively, his newer songs are much much more well crafted and just better than 4 chords on a badly recorded acoustic guitar while Conor Oberst practically cries over the top. If I'd never heard of Bright Eyes before and was listening to them for the first time I'd write off the first few albums as just being angsty teenager noise.  The same applies to Modest Mouse, songs like Edit The Sad Parts and Workin' On Leavin' The Livin' are beautiful and haunting, but if you take away the emotions and your nostalgia, World At Large and The Ground Walks With Time In A Box are much better written and composed songs, and far more reflective of someone who's technically old enough to be a grand dad now."

ModestMouse,3b1l4z,matckama,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:05:21 2015 UTC,Wonderfully put. Thank you.   Ps-it's strange for Dale Gribble to make so much sense
ModestMouse,3b1l4z,Bill__Buttlicker,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:34:03 2015 UTC,"I think this is such a salient thing to say. Isaac and the whole band are different people now (and I mean that literally, too, only Isaac and Green are left now, right?) There's no reason they should be making anything remotely like ""old"" Modest Mouse. The old Modest Mouse is dead, and that's just the way things go. You walk around dying every second too, becoming someone new. There's something to be said as well for how long the new albums have taken to make. He's lived with this music and really bled for it, and the old stuff is just thrown out there raw for everyone to look at. That's not what Modest Mouse is anymore. This is the real Modest Mouse, this is what the music is supposed to sound like."
ModestMouse,3b1l4z,maxwellsearcy,3,Fri Jul 10 23:52:49 2015 UTC,"Longtime MM fan here, since 99 and I've long tried to analyze what exactly happened between 'old MM' basically Parlour Tricks EP and everything before it and 'new MM' which is Good News to present. I've come up with why fans have made a distinction.   It really started with some specific sounding tunes on Good News that sounded kind of unlike anything MM had ever done before. Tunes like The Devil's Workday, Dance Hall, Satin in a Coffin, there was a very specific and noticeable change in two key areas: Isaac's vocals and vocal delivery changed, his 'pretty' singing was gone and it was more of a gruff, shouting style vocal delivery that was not really present at all on (for example) Moon and Antarctica save for maybe the chorus of Tiny Cities. So to longtime fans you have Isaac singing on half the album in a very different manner. The other key change was the addition of horns, trumpets. I love horns in other indie rock bands (Broken Social Scene) but for me I just don't think they fit very well in a lot of the new MM material. Also Jeremiah didn't play on Good News and I think that adversely made the drumming less interesting.   So for many MM fans this was a jarring change. We went from the gorgeous vocal delivery in Night on the Sun to a drastically different sound in Satin in the Coffin, etc in the span of only one release.   I honestly also don't think the success of Float On was a problem for ""old MM""  fans. That is one of the better songs on Good News for sure.   That being said I do put myself in the ""old MM"" camp and I am not particularly a big fan of Good News or We Were Dead, however the one area I disagree with the OP of this thread is when it comes to Strangers To Ourselves. I think it's a pretty great album and a return to form. Save for Pistol which again has the same abrasive 'new Isaac' vocal delivery that old MM fans will hate. And Wicked Campaign which sounds like new alternative crap. But the rest of STO is pretty decent IMO."
ModestMouse,3b1l4z,Right_All_The_Time,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:39:15 2015 UTC,"Isaac's vocals and vocal delivery changed, his 'pretty' singing was gone and it was more of a gruff, shouting style vocal delivery       I don't agree with this: ""Different City"", ""Alone Down There"", every single song on This Is A Long Drive except ""Mechanical Birds,"" ""Lounge (Closing Time),"" ""Shit Luck,"" ""Jesus Christ was an Only Child,""Cowboy Dan,"" ""Doin' The Cockroach,"" etc. There isn't a Modest Mouse album that doesn't have some kind of gruff shouting on it."
ModestMouse,3b1l4z,maxwellsearcy,6,Sat Jul 11 00:00:23 2015 UTC,"I don't get the hate for the new stuff, but it seems that some fans of long lasting bands feel that way. Death Cab For Cutie also has a fractured fan base, with people saying they'd like DCFC tore turn to their ""old"" sound.   I've always preferred to hear bands I like grow and try different things.   As an example, I grew up on Metallica. I loved their first bunch of albums. I felt they (and to me, metal as well) peaked with ...and justice for all. The black album was ok, commercial. Then the Load albums came out, and I loved them. Different approach. But the fans went ballistic, wanting the old sound back. Sadly, Metallica listened and came out with St Anger. It was terrible to hear these guys trying to sound like angry teenagers again. I actually felt embarrassed for them.   Long story short, appreciate the growth of a band. You don't have to like the new stuff as much as the old stuff. But I'm pretty sure you wouldn't like hearing the same [insert favourite album here] for twenty years."

ModestMouse,3aze40,DarknessLeo,14,Wed Jun 24 18:52:47 2015 UTC,"The few lyrics that aren't repeated are fantastic:   I'm gonna angle for telepathy cuz I don't know the words to say.  Well I'm gonna act up but not in your fuckin' play. I'll let you win the argument if things still go my way.  Well I haven't had enough and I said I had my fill. The past does not exist and I'm told it never will. I guess that I'm stuck here like a plant on a windowsill.  I'm gonna give myself a shot, I could get myself a pill, I'm gonna go and try to buy a little more time to kill.   and this Ugly Casanova shared lyric:   Committing crimes running down the alley.

ModestMouse,3aze40,forgivedurden,8,Wed Jun 24 22:05:31 2015 UTC,I guess during the recording of Good News Issac said the band used to get drunk and play this song over and over as a rant just to have a good time and yell and shit..

ModestMouse,3aze40,dylonpollak,5,Wed Jun 24 20:45:35 2015 UTC,I like it well enough. It helps that it's on what I consider to be the better half of Good News.
ModestMouse,3aze40,bigbadbiggie666,6,Wed Jun 24 19:17:49 2015 UTC,I've always liked it as well. But there are very few MM tracks that I don't like

ModestMouse,3awgh8,RiversideRhino,25,Wed Jun 24 01:32:46 2015 UTC,"Absolutely my favorite song on STO. Great imagery in the lyrics, pulsing guitars, and rangy vocals.  I think this verse is the most memorable part of the entire album:   ""The family living upstairs must have a fleet of ridin lawn mowers/While the novelist to my right's convinced that every woman's a whore/But he bothers me time and again to set him up with my very best friends and I say ""Wut?!""/Says he doesn't restate but he will not shut up!""  It's so offbeat and odd, and that makes it great. The sound of genuine confusion in Isaac's voice when he says ""what"" makes me chuckle every time.  And how could you not love the way Isaac pronounces ""westren?"""
ModestMouse,3awgh8,deadkathy,10,Wed Jun 24 02:25:17 2015 UTC,"I first heard it as ""restroom concerns"""
ModestMouse,3awgh8,iamRYANGOSLINGama,5,Wed Jun 24 02:59:57 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's on purpose. Isaac likes to play with words. (Etceteranough?/Is there enough?) I think he wants you to hear restroom and western at the same time. That's why he sings it so oddly. The song is about how as a western, modern, society we'd rather stay in literally any room if it meant avoiding staying outdoors. He goes on to describe some quite annoying living conditions, and points out those are still better than living with nature to western society (nature, in his opinion is the best room, and it's the last room we want.) These restroom concerns are all I ever really seem to be concerned with. ""You want to stay where there's no toilet, are you crazy?"" I know the lyrics are written as western, but I think it's both. That's just how clever Isaac's lyrics are."
ModestMouse,3awgh8,justaboxinacage,3,Tue Jun 30 04:28:03 2015 UTC,I don't think he intends for you to think it's restroom as well. He's just saying West'ren sometimes
ModestMouse,3awgh8,FloaterFloater,7,Thu Jul 2 10:10:25 2015 UTC,"My favorite line is ""Go reckless, unharmed//Yep, the shut-ins, they're well armed//Well, we all led the charge//'Til we ran aground in our party barge//"" Such a wonderfully written song.

ModestMouse,3awgh8,mogaly,5,Wed Jun 24 07:58:44 2015 UTC,one of two on the album! He also says it like that in Pistol
ModestMouse,3awgh8,ghost_victim,9,Wed Jun 24 16:04:53 2015 UTC,"My favorite song from StO. I think in a lot of ways, it's one of Isaac's most personal songs. Like everyone else, I love the ""...What?!"" line, perfectly delivered to show Isaac's disdain and confusion with this growing phony culture. I have this theory: at the beginning of the song, the first time the chorus comes in, he's obviously addressing these people who are obsessed with the ""Western concerns."" He's asking them, isn't it hard being tired all the time? But then, when the song slows down, and reaches the part:   I am going to bury my head in the woods right now /  Scan for some mycelium and bring a little back to town   We know from interviews that that's what Isaac actually did at some point during the 7 years between albums. Burnt out, he went to a forest and just spent time there away from everything. I think there, when the chorus hits, he's no longer addressing other people, he's addressing himself. Don't you know it's hard, feeling tired all the time? Such simple writing imbued with this wonderful, powerful duality in the context of the song. Far and away my favorite from the album, and I think I would put it in my top 10."
ModestMouse,3awgh8,TempSpastic,4,Wed Jun 24 14:17:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree that the first ""Doncha"" is sarcastic and mocking and the second is sincere.   You really get the Long Drive feel that Isaac doesn't fit in with the rest of society. The second half Doncha to me is him saying ""You think I want to feel like an outsider and see the hypocrisy in everything? Who would volunteer to feel exhausted all the time? I'm just going to remove myself and bring my own happiness back with me. Then that doesn't last and we get the awesome last verse."
ModestMouse,3awgh8,talexsmith,6,Wed Jun 24 17:46:44 2015 UTC,"Hi, lurker here on the MM sub. This is my fav also. It's odd how the songs, lyrically, especially with MM songs, invoke so many old thought/ memories/ emotions. The lines you mention are ones that stuck out for me also(as well as the rich sounding bridge directly afterwards). Anywho, I went and checked out the lyrics for this song which, to be honest are a mystery throughout the album to me. Fascinating stuff:here's the link as I'm sure formatting will be screwed up if I paste. Just superb writing..."
ModestMouse,3awgh8,bluebus74,6,Wed Jun 24 03:09:28 2015 UTC,One of the songs I memorized quickly off of StO. It's just so fun to sing along too.

ModestMouse,3awgh8,EthanWins,4,Thu Jun 25 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"Love this song and album, I love the imagery (The bathroom's outside Police tape is tied To the doorknobs of rooms Nine through thirty-two) the jamming out in the middle is great, and I adore how he gets into damn near ranting in the middle. The song goes into a really slow pace halfway into itself which is nice. Then the song sings to which the lyrics are sang in the same tone but it now feels even more like a party song which is really great. Definitely one of the best songs on the album."
ModestMouse,3awgh8,lazorgod,5,Wed Jun 24 03:21:06 2015 UTC,"Westren concerns Oh Issac, I adore you and your mispronunciations! It adds to the charm :) Also this song is one of my faves on STO."

ModestMouse,3at8ay,-shifty-,6,Tue Jun 23 19:23:25 2015 UTC,LSD = acid. Also there would be no point to doing LSD mid-show since it takes a few hours to really kick in.
ModestMouse,3at8ay,willb483,6,Tue Jun 23 12:45:56 2015 UTC,Acid takes like a half hour to kick in. At least in blotter form. And I don't imagine it's longer with tabs or liquid.

ModestMouse,3asbhg,iamRYANGOSLINGama,23,Tue Jun 23 02:51:15 2015 UTC,"One of the big things that keeps me coming back to Modest Mouse is that different songs will hit you, and really connect, at different times in your life.  Sometimes when things aren't going so great, you'll hear some songs that just hit you at such a deep level, songs that you've heard so many times.  But this time, at that moment, it makes more sense than any other song would.  And when situations are different, you'll connect more with other songs on that same level.   Some songs connect with pain, depression, and the like, but others with curiosity, and engagement, and embracing life.  It's something that's very unique (to me, at least) to Modest Mouse, and the reason to play their library on random regularly; you may never know which song will be the one you'll connect with at that point in time."

ModestMouse,3asbhg,ClintonHarvey,11,Tue Jun 23 11:03:54 2015 UTC,"I actually once did an analysis on their discography. My theory, or at least how experience it, goes like this.  It starts with a protagonist living an isolated life in the country, expressing the loneliness of such a life (long drive). In an attempt to escape this emptiness, he ventures to the city, only to find the same emptiness  (lonesome crowded west). Then, he says screw society and tries to embrace loneliness  (M&A). That doesn't work, so he tires just drifting  (Good news) and even traveling the oceans  (dead before ship sank). Giving up, he tells the masses of this emptiness we all apparently feel with the latest album. The cover of this album is a trailor park, so having covered cities and rural areas, this covers the suburbs. Thats the story that unfolded in my mind when i tackled all 6 albums at once"
ModestMouse,3asbhg,sex_panther96,4,Tue Jun 23 06:13:28 2015 UTC,Cool theory. There's definitely allot of traveling and isolation in his lyrics.
ModestMouse,3asbhg,SickPuppyLover,3,Tue Jun 23 14:25:48 2015 UTC,"Just a few days ago, I was thinking about all the different associations I've made with MM songs.   The most oddball one I have is with Trailer Trash. Four or five years ago, my friend ""Jane"" showed me Modest Mouse, and I was all about it. Not long after, she became pregnant at 16. Her boyfriend at the time was quite a mess, which is a whole story of its own, but ultimately, Jane ended up with nobody to accompany her through her abortion procedure.    I can't remember if I offered or if she asked me, but it's not really important to me anyway. I ended up going with her so she didn't have to go it alone, and while we were waiting in the lobby at Planned Parenthood, I pulled out my MP3 player and she requested Trailer Trash, which I hadn't listened to yet. It was my first taste of LCW, and I really enjoyed it. But I was quite worried that the experience of the procedure would taint my regard of the song, and possibly the band as a whole.    Mouse is still my favorite band, though, and it hasn't even come close to changing since. If anything, the experience is another that only strengthens my love of their music. Thinking back on it now, this experience is actually the first of the many associations I've made with Mouse songs."
ModestMouse,3asbhg,HeyLookAtMyBeard,5,Tue Jun 23 05:21:08 2015 UTC,"That experience fits into the theme of the song too- dealing with life as it is (at least in my opinion). Thanks for sharing, I'm glad to see that MM has made an emotional impact in other people's lives as well."

Now when I listen to it, I get a different association just because I'm in a different place in life. It's truly an honest song.  Custom Concern also really related to depression for me, alongside with the repetition in our daily lives and need to fit into society's standards for living.  What I loved about modest mouse was that their songs were about real themes in life, and not necessarily just about love. Just gritty, real, and honest emotion."

He's letting the guitar feedback in the room then cutting the signal rhythmically. Literally clicking it on then off with the beat. In this era he was using a Fender Super Six Reverb (hilariously big for a combo amp) with the spring reverb set pretty high.

ModestMouse,3ar0d8,Danae-rain,5,Mon Jun 22 20:28:48 2015 UTC,"I wish they would still play Teeth like God's shoeshine.  The last time I remember seeing them play it live was maybe 2003, so at least I got to experience it once.  Hopefully they'll play it at the Hollywood Forever show in August."
ModestMouse,3ar0d8,ClintonHarvey,3,Tue Jun 23 11:02:32 2015 UTC,"Man, I thought about going to this show. I'm regretting my decisions."
ModestMouse,3ar0d8,rustycherry,2,Tue Jun 23 03:05:34 2015 UTC,"I was at this show too, and this set list blew me away. Also they extensively jammed out every song. I have a feeling this show was being recorded, because all of there other set-lists lately have been similar, and this one was not."
ModestMouse,3ar0d8,STICKSTICKITY,2,Tue Jun 23 15:47:35 2015 UTC,I was there! It was one of the best I've seen them play. However I was at the concert he cut himself during jamming tiny cities so I've seen him at one of his craziest! Big fan! Great show!
ModestMouse,3ar0d8,sjurrens,2,Tue Jun 23 23:30:12 2015 UTC,"Drove 5 hours at 5 a.m to get there, was too early, still managed to miss the first 2 and half acts, arrived in time to catch the last part of the act before modest mouse, heat and lack of fluids made me slightly delusional, yelled along with the lyrics like a bit of a fool due to being so ecstatic to be there and see them live, left to drive another 5 and a half hours back, arriving home at roughly 5- 6 a.m. so fucking worth it."
ModestMouse,3ar0d8,SynatiousDisease,2,Wed Jun 24 04:48:12 2015 UTC,What a much better setlist than the Firefly show.
ModestMouse,3aqppl,DarknessLeo,11,Mon Jun 22 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"Night on the sun is one of my absolute favorite songs in the world.   The bleak soundscape and emotional poignancy that stems from just a few choice lines and, at heart, two chords really speaks to Isaac's masterful songwriting ability. Not many people can create a 6 and a half minute song that bleeds this degree of atmosphere while maintaining such a simple structure. Not many people can even create a 6 and a half minute song worth listening to."
ModestMouse,3aqppl,totemair,5,Mon Jun 22 20:23:03 2015 UTC,The Japanese version of Night on the Sun has an extended version of the song:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmzBcu8TWgc
ModestMouse,3aqppl,Styrofoam--Boots,6,Mon Jun 22 20:31:01 2015 UTC,Its my favorite EP they've released by far.  Night on the sun is also easily my favorite song.  I also feel like So much beauty in dirt doesnt get enough recognition. It's such a beautiful song.
ModestMouse,3aqppl,dylonpollak,6,Mon Jun 22 22:35:01 2015 UTC,"So much beauty in dirt is easily in my top ten favorite songs. I just wish it was longer, then it would probably be top five. Such a great song."
ModestMouse,3aqppl,baconator0213,3,Mon Jun 22 22:53:32 2015 UTC,Your Life is just an earlier version of Lives. I'm pretty sure it's well known.

ModestMouse,3aqppl,beard_lover,2,Mon Jun 22 23:04:00 2015 UTC,"""Your Life"" is fantastic, you're right that it seems unknown among fans. The lyrics are amazing, and that riff...so, so good."

I saw them in Tampa and the show was great, but the crowd were a bunch of listless losers not even reacting to the music. I remember I was leaving when they started the encore and I started dancing and grooving, but the crowd was like a sheet of ice."
ModestMouse,3aov5s,donald20,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:30:07 2015 UTC,I was not fond of the crowd when I saw them in Kansas City either. Hoping the Omaha festival is better this year.
ModestMouse,3aov5s,Nubraskan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:58:05 2015 UTC,I didn't like the crowd at Firefly this year. I thought they were terrible. Everyone was waiting for Float On to come on and meanwhile people were yelling and crowdsurfing and just in general taking up space at a show they shouldn't have been at. I was 5 rows from the front and almost nobody around me knew any songs other than Dramamine and Float on.
ModestMouse,3aov5s,datkidbrad,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:12:31 2015 UTC,I've seen MM several times in the KC area and the crowds have been terrible here post-Float On.
ModestMouse,3aov5s,kurtless,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"The crowd wasn't terrible at all where I was, you could hear the people's voices overpowering the band for a lot of key segments and the cheers waiting for the encore were loud as shit.  I was pretty near the front though.  Also I was so happy that they played A Different City."
ModestMouse,3aov5s,Draylin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:21:17 2015 UTC,"Outdoor shows tend to be lackluster, but in a venue setting is where you will really get what you are looking for."
ModestMouse,3aov5s,STICKSTICKITY,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:50:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Saw them in Oakland a few years ago. Minus waiting for them to get on stage for nearly three hours, it was an excellent show."

ModestMouse,3aiqvw,awag,2,Sat Jun 20 22:04:31 2015 UTC,I was watching on AXS. I thought they were only pausing and were going to start up with the last part of the song but then the crowd started cheering and it was over.
ModestMouse,3aiqvw,tissin,2,Sat Jun 20 16:28:21 2015 UTC,They usually do that :/

ModestMouse,3aiqvw,yelleknave,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:38:36 2015 UTC,When they were playing Teeth in the mid 2000s they would always cut it off before the second explosion in the song. It always baffled me.

ModestMouse,3aifvq,tissin,2,Sat Jun 20 14:23:11 2015 UTC,They showed the whole set on AXS channel

ModestMouse,3a69c4,MsMagee,5,Wed Jun 17 16:58:20 2015 UTC,"You mean the next new album?  I think they will most likely continue presenting Strangers to Ourselves for these summer tours before they roll out songs from the one they are working on.  Besides, looking at their tour schedule they obviously haven't the time to be actively working on a new one now.  This touring gig is hard work, and any time between tours [which is not much] should be occupied with taking care of business on the home front, not writing and recording a new new album."

But choosing what songs to put on the playlist was very difficult, and in the end, I simply couldn't find a place for any STO songs without stretching the playlist length too far. If there was going to be one on there, it would be either Ground Walks or Pups To Dust.  To me, Modest Mouse songs are like boobs: Some are better than others, but they're all great.

ModestMouse,3a85jg,IsaacBrak,3,Wed Jun 17 23:55:04 2015 UTC,"Modest Mouse won't be doing the ""classic album"" set at Riot Fest. I doubt they would do that at all for some time, if ever. Doesn't seem like Isaac's thing. The money is definitely better. Thurston Moore said when Sonic Youth was offered shows doing Daydream Nation there was like $20k more on the table for playing that album. However IF MM ever did a show playing TLCW or M&A I would probably be willing to get on a plane and travel just for that. Isaac likes money but he also has ethics and doesn't like being told what to do."
ModestMouse,3a85jg,Right_All_The_Time,4,Thu Jun 18 14:12:13 2015 UTC,They will play Sad Sappy Sucker in it's entirety. Isaac will prop up a little answering machine on a stool with a speaker and you will all enjoy it.

ModestMouse,3a4ru9,awkwardlyfeminine,3,Wed Jun 17 22:18:11 2015 UTC,"This is also a pretty fun song to play on guitar. It's slow, but surprisingly detailed.  Here's the tab. (This is the only tab I've found that is actually good. There are some really bad ones, and probably some that don't have the detail that this song requires) You only use F, C, G, and A chords, but there are one or two variants of each -- only adding or removing a finger or two; nothing crazy. You'll get it.  It ends up not sounding as ethereal as the album version, but it's a good effect for one guitar."

ModestMouse,3a3shf,VB_srl,23,Wed Jun 17 00:26:00 2015 UTC,Underrated: karma payment plan
ModestMouse,3a3shf,stankyschub,11,Wed Jun 17 02:03:45 2015 UTC,Everything on The Fruit That Ate Itself is underrated.
ModestMouse,3a3shf,IceCreamSocialist,19,Wed Jun 17 05:01:22 2015 UTC,"I'd argue Talking shit has some of their best lyrics. Discounting a song because it's inferior to another song is pointless, as then every song ever written excpet ""the best song"" is over rated, because its inferior to the best.  Agreed on space travel and march into the sea!"
ModestMouse,3a3shf,r0sebery,4,Wed Jun 17 01:57:28 2015 UTC,"Then again, there is no such thing as a best song ever. There is just a tribute."
ModestMouse,3a3shf,RazorDisaster,2,Wed Jun 17 11:46:06 2015 UTC,"I really like the line about a ""bad tempered prom queen at a homecoming dance"", but other than that none of the lyrics really mean much to me. I like the message and idea of regretting one's decisions, and I think the song's lyrics portray this well. But I think the whole thing is a little pretentious with how it shares it's message.  I do like the song, and looking at the lyrics while writing this post has made me appreciate it a bit more, but I don't think it's the masterpiece everyone says it is."
ModestMouse,3a3shf,r0sebery,3,Wed Jun 17 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"I guess it just depends on where you're at.   ""And I claim I'm not excited with my life anymore  So I blame this town, this job, these friends, the truth is it's myself  And I'm trying to understand myself and pinpoint who I am  When I finally get it figured out, I've changed the whole damn plan""    Pretty much sums up how a lot of people have felt or will feel at some point in their life."

Yes it's good, but it's not what people say it is   Underrated - Little Motel. I'll probably catch a lot for this, but this is definitely a personal thing and likely has a lot to do with what was going on in my life when I first heard it.   Underrated - The View. I just really like this tune.   Underrated - Custom Concern. I don't hear much about this one but it's one of my favorites."

I was listening to Trailer Trash in class today and I had to hold back tears during the solo. As for Talking Shit, it's silly to say that the lyrics are inferior to one another.

ModestMouse,3a3shf,davey101,9,Wed Jun 17 16:50:28 2015 UTC,Good call on Space Travel!  Underrated - Steam Engenius. It's different and funky with some fun lyrics. I prefer the earlier stuff but I really do like WWD a lot.  Overrated - Whale Song. Seems like a cult favorite on here but I never really got into it.

There's just something about the strange, almost fun anxiety on this song from everyone swapping instruments. It's almost like it was conceptual. By singing about struggling to swim as they're struggling to play these foreign instruments.   Overrated: Blame it on the Tetons - This is a personal thing. It feels like a wedding feels to me, and I really don't like weddings, for the most part."

I actually think it's underrated. I know it's well loved by most of us here, but that's about it. I rank it as my second favorite album."
ModestMouse,3a3shf,deadkathy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:32:51 2015 UTC,Oh really? Maybe then. I thought I always saw people putting Satellite Skin in their top 5. Maybe I'm mixing it up with another.

ModestMouse,3a28bl,itsmekyle02,3,Wed Jun 17 04:09:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it goes all the way to Steamboat, but it's OpenAir CPR. 102.3 FM/1340 AM in Denver.   They'll be sending it up to Fort Collins soon too, maybe that'll be close enough to you?"
ModestMouse,3a28bl,seth227,5,Wed Jun 17 04:54:40 2015 UTC,I hate radio edits
ModestMouse,3a28bl,matckama,0,Wed Jun 17 02:45:00 2015 UTC,There are cases where radio edits make long as hell songs easier to listen to.
ModestMouse,3a28bl,bigbadbiggie666,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:49:31 2015 UTC,That's certainly true. But I personally would still prefer the song as presented by the artist.

I contacted Fat Possum and they sent replacements,  these were better,  but not much. I wish they would've done a better job with these represses."
ModestMouse,3a34sb,twofacedmonster,2,Wed Jun 17 06:03:09 2015 UTC,"Baby Blue Sedan on both my LCW and BNOOS represses sounds a bit off compared to the digital version, but that's really all I've noticed and it could just be that they used a crappy master for the vinyl. The rest of the represses sound fine for me. I haven't managed to pick up Everywhere yet, thanks for reminding me :)"

ModestMouse,39xn4r,Funkbass,17,Mon Jun 15 18:46:35 2015 UTC,Saw someone say in a thread close to when the album came out about this song: I really wish they drew out this song similarly to the Whale Song and really jammed on it for another 4 or 5 minutes.   Love this song but it feels so damn short.
ModestMouse,39xn4r,WjB79,5,Mon Jun 15 19:10:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not an audio editor (I'm sure there is a better name) at all. But, I'll see if I can find similarities in the song where I could make the song longer."

ModestMouse,39xn4r,ThatOtherChrisGuy,3,Tue Jun 16 19:01:18 2015 UTC,I would like it more if it didn't sound crammed. It sounds like a long Long Drive song compressed into 3 and a half minutes.
ModestMouse,39xn4r,tournant,2,Mon Jun 15 19:33:55 2015 UTC,One of my favorites.
ModestMouse,39xn4r,FunFetishes,2,Mon Jun 15 19:30:19 2015 UTC,I'm surprised no one has pointed out its similarities to The Whale Song..... I loved the entire album entirely too much.

ModestMouse,39xn4r,FiftyCentLighter,2,Tue Jun 16 01:47:54 2015 UTC,"The second verse from this song contains some of my all-time favourite lyrics (I want to hear more about the Tortoise's story!), but the repetitive chorus and weird pacing to the song just don't appeal to me. It's just an uneven bumpy song. I dunno. Usually skip this one.  (Yet I love Whale Song!)"
ModestMouse,39xn4r,GeneralKrunch,5,Fri Jun 19 19:23:38 2015 UTC,I personally wasn't a fan. It just didn't appeal to me.

ModestMouse,39xn4r,gcola12,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:52:59 2015 UTC,I am enthralled with the meaning of the song. I believe it encapsulates STO and even Modest Mouse perfectly- humans had a chance but blew it.

ModestMouse,39xyoe,slashaholik,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:52:20 2015 UTC,That's crazy! was it on the side of the building where the buses park? It'd be a dream come true if they came back to the capitol one day. I'm currently trying to go to the brooklyn show but i'm without a ticket at the moment unfortunately.
ModestMouse,39xyoe,slashaholik,2,Tue Jun 16 01:04:07 2015 UTC,Yes it was! I'm so pumped for the Brooklyn show. I'm also seeing them this weekend at Firefly. Any show within like 5 hour radius I'm there lol

ModestMouse,39psj3,ghost_victim,2,Sun Jun 14 02:46:46 2015 UTC,Is this taken from any of the album art or was this an original idea of yours/the tattoo artist? Because it's awesome. You just made me reconsider getting a tattoo.
ModestMouse,39psj3,Frenchthealpaca,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:28:22 2015 UTC,I came up with the design but was very lenient in trying to let the artist show his style. I'll change some details in a touch up but I am really happy with how well he did.
ModestMouse,39psj3,jcsatan,2,Sun Jun 14 16:05:22 2015 UTC,Looks awesome! Love how you incorporated a rat as well
ModestMouse,39psj3,tynamite,2,Sat Jun 13 16:53:10 2015 UTC,I don't know much about tattoos. Is the color tattoo? I think it looks really neat. I like this Linda's of tattoos cause they reference sow thing without it being a logo.
ModestMouse,39o7kk,doyouspeakthelingo,14,Sat Jun 13 04:29:51 2015 UTC,A timeless album. Could have been released yesterday.

ModestMouse,39o7kk,gcola12,3,Sat Jun 13 23:26:06 2015 UTC,The best Modest Mouse album. Classic. Not a single remotely bad tune on the whole damned thing. The first one I fell in love with. Eternally kicking myself for not seeing them on the tour for Moon when I had a chance in fall 2000.
ModestMouse,39o7kk,Right_All_The_Time,2,Tue Jun 16 10:31:25 2015 UTC,So good

ModestMouse,39qi1o,deadkathy,23,Sat Jun 13 21:30:26 2015 UTC,"Not downvoting, but oh my goddamn, I can't understand how anyone who likes MM could dislike this song. It's probably my favorite just because it's the absolute quintessential MM song. Every element of them that I love is in this song. Mad Isaac, somber/pensive Isaac, sarcastic/irreverent Isaac. Loud, discordant rifts, purposeful tempo changes. Poignant lyrics (do you need a lot of what you got to survive?/I'm on the corner of this and this, this and this, and it's allllllllll wrong). Jesus Christ, I'm listening to it just based on this topic and I'm seriously getting irrationally upset. It's a perfect fucking song."
ModestMouse,39qi1o,Phidillidup,6,Sun Jun 14 04:34:32 2015 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better. This song (for me anyway) encapsulates everything I love about MM. Plus how can you not sing along when he defeatedly sings ""so long, farewell... goodbye."""

ModestMouse,39qi1o,pigslord,4,Sat Jun 13 23:09:32 2015 UTC,"agree to disagree, esp. the ""samey"" part. first time i heard Teeth, i wan't paying attention to track times or anything and assumed it was like 3 different songs. it has quite a bit to it in my opinion. Plus the energy in the track just gets me pumped, right off the bat. but hey, you're not a bad fan of mm for not liking it or anything. i'm all for hearing other opinions"
ModestMouse,39qi1o,auggien,3,Sun Jun 14 03:11:40 2015 UTC,"It's a really dynamic song, both sonically and lyrically. Sonically, we have the driving, twisted, furiously-anxious first riff. It starts the record off on a huge bang. Then, we get the strummed and frequently-muted guitar part for ""Oh! If you could compact your conscience."" It feels very vulnerable, and introduces the Modest side of the Mouse on what's arguably their best album right at the start. Then, it transitions into the dissonant descending arpeggio that could almost be from a Slint song. They pop-up a number of times on LCW, on what're also arguably the most stand-out tracks on the album, such as Lounge (Closing Time), Doin' the Cockroach, and Cowboy Dan. It introduces a deep melancholy, and is the perfect vehicle for the start of Isaac's commentary on the urban sprawl - also something LCW is known for. It closes off on ""so long, farewell, goodbye"", and the track goes DEAD silent. As all Mouse fans know, this is a false end, which is an incredibly daring thing to do on any song, let alone the first on the record. Then, Jeremiah jumps in with  a simple-yet exhilarating three-count on his drums (I don't speak the drummer lingo, folks, so correct me if I'm wrong). The song explodes into this frantic frenzy for these lyrics that just expose raw shame about it all. The song rides off on a return to the dissonant arpeggio, and it opens the perfect door for the more forgiving ""Heart Cooks Brain.""  It's definitely abrasive, but that's where much of its charm lies. It's meant to be abrasive. After all, you're given the raw topics of the entire record served to you in one track. With an album as dense as the Lonesome Crowded West, it's bound to be overwhelming. That being said, the song has quite a bit of merit. It's without a doubt my favorite Mouse opening track (sorry, Dramamine)."
ModestMouse,39qi1o,StrensmsToothInACan,2,Sun Jun 14 13:51:47 2015 UTC,"Not my favorite either. Just can't figure it out. I thought it was me. Cause sometimes I wont ""get"" a song for years and then bam I like it. But I don't think that will ever happen for this song. But you may be getting lotsa down votes cause lots a people love it."
ModestMouse,39qi1o,Danae-rain,2,Sat Jun 13 20:08:39 2015 UTC,"Respect your opinion but just a tiny correction - just to let you know the lyrics in the beginning don't all end in 'yeah.'

However I love that song and it's tied with Dramamine for best album opener. It's the purest form of mm that pretty much (for me) defines how unique this band is and why I love them. Strangers to ourselves (for me) borrows from all their sounds and is also good a example...

ModestMouse,39em40,iamRYANGOSLINGama,2,Thu Jun 11 14:51:30 2015 UTC,i agree on this. I don't really like the album version but this live MMIV record is pure gold.
ModestMouse,39em40,panzerfausten,4,Fri Jun 12 20:26:57 2015 UTC,When I saw MM like 10 years ago Tiny Cities Made of Ashes was the song that was totally different live. It was so HEAVY and much harder than the album version. I didn't like the song much until I heard it that way.
ModestMouse,39em40,BeardedBaseballFreak,4,Thu Jun 11 16:36:57 2015 UTC,OF COURSE WE KNOW. Kicked of their tour in Tampa with this song. It was FUCKING ELECTRIC. That fucker Isaac just hammered on those strings and blew my cranium apart.

I've been in dark times plenty of times in life. Shit, I'm in dark times right now.. But years ago they played in Austin while I didn't have my own place, I was just couch surfing, burdening my friends constantly... just trying to get my shit together. They played a show at Stubb's BBQ which is an outdoors venue that has an amazing view from the street (or the garage across the street) So I am unable to acquire tickets to this particular show so I watched/listened to the show from outside the venue. I lingered for a little over an hour after the show ended and low and behold who do I see?   Jeremiah exits a back door, followed by Eric.. Then out comes Isaac.  I shook all their hands and told them I really enjoyed the show, I joked with them all explaining that it hadn't cost me anything and I watched from the street but then quickly explained that I owned all their music (queue pulling out my Sad Sappy Sucker vinyl) and had seen them 9 times before, making this show my 10th Modest Mouse concert. Jeremiah joked that he had lost count of how many Modest Mouse shows he had been to a long time ago. We all laughed.  Isaac hung out for a bit with me and my friend, about 3-5 minutes beyond the duration of a cigarette. He signed my Sad Sappy Sucker vinyl and commented on how long ago he had written all the music on that album. It was surreal to hear him talk about his own music. I was able to tell him that his lyrics had helped me through some really dark stages in life and amplified the greater moments too. He noticed I had a hot air balloon w/ anchor tattoo on my forearm and we compared our tats, he said without a doubt mine was cooler because it was colored in. I then showed him my other tattoo which reads ""sharpen your teeth or lay flat"" written across a banner splattered with blood and a few loose teeth. I could tell the moment he realized what he was reading. A huge smile shot across his face and he said ""I'd love to do some more with that project if I could ever find the time."" I somewhat jokingly told him he should cover 'Smoke Like Ribbons' as Modest Mouse next time they came to Austin, and that their sets should be at least 3 hours long and he said ""You got it man."" albeit sarcastically, he said he would, damnit!   (They played their first show since the one I'm talking about 8 months ago and while he didn't cover any Ugly Casanova, they did play Night on the Sun, so that works..)  But yea dude... sorry you are goin' through shit right now. If it makes you feel any better I'm sure Isaac browses this subreddit from time to time so maybe he already knows you are grateful for his music.  TL;DR - Even if you can't afford a ticket just go to the nearest venue and you'll have at least a chance of meeting him face to face. It worked for me."
ModestMouse,3999p0,ComplacentCamera,2,Sun Jun 14 14:38:23 2015 UTC,Same here. I really dont know either. I thought about messaging his reddit account the day he day was on here....not sure if you tried that yet? Maybe send a letter to his house?
ModestMouse,3999p0,ComplacentCamera,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:39:49 2015 UTC,"I did a Google search trying to find contact information, but to me it all seemed like a bunch of bullshit. I remember watching an interview he did fairly recently, which I believe was through Vice, where they were discussing the current house/studio he had been renovating/living at, out in Oregon. But it's been a while and can't seem to find it now, nor do I recall whether they revealed his address. I thought about going to his labels current website and see if there was a way to get ahold of him that way. But I just had a gut feeling he wouldn't personally read it."
ModestMouse,3999p0,C34,2,Wed Jun 10 04:53:42 2015 UTC,"Is this the one? And you are probably right....he might not read it, and he probably wouldn't respond....but if you feel as touched as I am by his music, it doesn't matter. Just keep trying to contact him to let him know what impact he has had on your life. He may just respond he may not. But it would feel really great just to let him know what a big part of your life his music is. :) Good luck. I think I may try to contact him here sometime soon as well."

Isaac never even said a word to the crowd between sets.   However, I've heard that they were having sound issues and he was pissed about it. I've heard of people seeing them at other festivals and it being just as good as regular shows.   But, in my experience, the regular shows were much much much better.   If you want to see them, go see them. They were pretty much the reason I want to Hangout last year and I am still glad that I went."

They pretty much just played without enthusiasm and once it was over, that was it. I don't think I'll be buying tickets again to see them at a festival. The shows are much funner on their own."
ModestMouse,397jua,felicitas04,2,Wed Jun 10 20:37:09 2015 UTC,Ive only ever seen them once. Last weekend at BFD in Cali.   They also had sound issues there. Im pretty sure he was pissed off. He left real quick and just mumbled a thanks into the mic.  But for my first show he blew me away.

I saw them at governor's ball and the sound wasn't great and they played a short set. When I've see them on their own they play way longer, mix up the setlist more, and isaac usually gets more into it. That being said, it's still mouse and if you want to see them live you should go regardless of the setting : )"

ModestMouse,394d0p,eatintrees,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:17:25 2015 UTC,"They didn't play as long as I had hoped for. I think they played maybe 9-10 songs. My last MM show was in 2007 and they played 16+3 on encore. I was disappointed with no encore but that was the venues fault and not MM.  edit: I was also in the pit and they sounded like crap, at least the vocals.  The idiot DJ's they had talking between the bands said they didn't have time for a mic check so I think that was to blame. I could barley hear Issac, I could only clearly hear him when he would say ""Well!""."
ModestMouse,394d0p,bwatters,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:17:42 2015 UTC,Yeah the vocals were fucked up due the stage crew.. But that didn't stop me from singing every word for everyone else around me! It was still a great time.. I wish they would've done a small after show at somewhere like the belly up

ModestMouse,38z47n,CanoeShoes,7,Mon Jun 8 03:04:22 2015 UTC,"I see it as one of their finest. Maybe it's just because I'm a fan of Bukowski, but man, I think Buk's influence on Isaac's writing is big time. You can see it spill all over in this song."

ModestMouse,38z47n,fokerpace2000,-3,Tue Jun 9 19:02:00 2015 UTC,Sounds like I'm in the minority here but I think it's an obnoxious tune. It's good if you love the MM 2004-2007 sound where Isaac liked his screaming gruff vocal delivery and fucktons of horns and over-instrumentation and throwing everything and the kitchen sink into the mix. It's overdone. I don't rate No One's First that highly in general. Think it's their worst EP since Dirty Fingernails. Things imported considerably on STO (except for Pistol).
ModestMouse,38z47n,Right_All_The_Time,7,Mon Jun 8 07:16:11 2015 UTC,I need this Dirty Fingernails EP. Sounds rare.

ModestMouse,38uwuf,ben_jammin98,4,Sun Jun 7 01:08:16 2015 UTC,"It's just a floyd rose bridge in the past, without the whammy bar. Using the heel of the hand to push the bridge in, which bends notes up and pulling up under the bridge with the pinkie bends notes down.   See how there is a recess in the body below the bridge. This allows the bridge to be pushed in, normally impossible on a 'regular' style bridge. The bridge on his modern guitars however, is designed with Brock, for Brock, to allow this technique to be done with ease. Here is an excerpt I've photographed which give you a better idea of his modern guitars.   It's relatively easy to mod a guitar like a strat to fit a floyd rose on to it! You need just a little bit of woodworking skills and a knowledge of tools such as routers. I did it myself a few years back when I figured out this secret myself :)"

ModestMouse,38uwuf,defimeshun,2,Sun Jun 7 02:14:47 2015 UTC,That's the thing - I have the perfect example when he was playing a 1997 show at the Mercury Theater in Tennessee and I know I watched it (among many from that show) on Youtube. I just can't remember the damn song or video.
ModestMouse,38uwuf,defimeshun,4,Sun Jun 7 02:26:07 2015 UTC,"I know Isaac likes to move the whammy with the side of his hand, but I'm not sure what you're talking about."
ModestMouse,38uwuf,defimeshun,2,Sun Jun 7 02:26:57 2015 UTC,I couldn't see a whammy on his guitar at all. Just saw him use the side of his hand on the bridge that gave a whammy-ish effect. This would be so much damn easier if I could find the fucking video I was talking about.

ModestMouse,38teip,skyraiderofreddit,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:41:07 2015 UTC,A ukulele playing the chords accompanied by a guitar playing the lead parts might be your best bet. I'd imagine the lead parts would be very very difficult to figure out and play on a ukulele.

ModestMouse,38pxer,DrSilverworm,16,Sun Jun 7 04:58:59 2015 UTC,"“God” in this scenario isn’t being used in the Christian sense of the word, i.e. a personal creator who cares about your thoughts and day-to-day. It’s being used in a more pantheistic sense.  The Indians encapsulated a very natural way of living, they were at peace with their environment and surroundings. They were a peaceful society and a sustainable one at that.  We are the European assholes who carried out Manifest Destiny. That is, being selfish assholes who not only killed, raped, and ruined a peaceful culture but decided that it was our right to do so. And we called into play the false notions of a personal God to justify our actions.  So we killed God and used a silly and selfish (false) idea of God to justify it. This brings back the ideas brought into play in The Tortoise and the Tourist metaphor: religions use metaphor to convey ideas of truth about the world around us. Mankind has been known to use these metaphors conveniently for selfish gain, and disregard the parts of the religion that are less convenient but are trying to point to truth.  (taken from my analysis on Genius.com)"
ModestMouse,38pxer,zenarcade3,7,Sat Jun 6 04:26:06 2015 UTC,"The Indians encapsulated a very natural way of living, they were at peace with their environment and surroundings. They were a peaceful society and a sustainable one at that.   This isn't true at all, except in our idealized representations of the past. Amerind societies used controlled burns to make prairies and grasslands out of forests, they warred with their neighbors, they were the exact same breed of jerks we are. We just have better stuff today.   For the purpose of the song, though, our myths of the ""noble savage"" that you point out are definitely how I'd interpret that phrase. I just wanted to contrast modern stories with the actual past."
ModestMouse,38pxer,McCaber,7,Sat Jun 6 15:30:55 2015 UTC,Was this the only song with a banjo part on the album?

ModestMouse,38pxer,Hissmam,3,Fri Jun 5 22:47:32 2015 UTC,Cowboys killed plenty of Indians so I can see his point. God is an Indian and you're an asshole so get on your horse and ride.   Also think it's fucked up how he's getting downvoted for sharing his interpretation of this song. Isaacs said himself that he'd rather the listener make his own interpretation.

ModestMouse,38pxer,Hobbes42,3,Fri Jun 5 22:47:38 2015 UTC,"I think he commonly refers to God being an Indian giver, meaning he gives life and takes it away. Also you're an asshole anyway you don't deserve it, get on your horse and ride and enjoy life while ya can! That's my take"

ModestMouse,38pxer,Hissmam,2,Sat Jun 6 09:14:18 2015 UTC,"They didn't always kill Indians. There were times of peace, alliances between indians and white people, and rather than killing they sometimes took their land. I don't see the song as one about killing God."

ModestMouse,38pxer,Acetius,5,Sat Jun 6 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"Well, no one said God is an Indian was the best part of STO, so not the perfect parallel. They just like it, as I imagine they like the rest of the songs as well, and obviously a lot more. Horn Intro was much shorter and simpler so I wouldn't count it as much, and Interlude (Milo) is good in it's own way and does it's job of splitting songs.

ModestMouse,38gpgb,Bill__Buttlicker,8,Thu Jun 4 15:31:46 2015 UTC,"I saw them last summer and people were singing along to a lot of songs. Although, it can be a little tough cause Isaac likes to ad-lib sometimes and that'll throw you off if you're just trying to sing the studio version of songs. Plus there are songs like Dramamine that you kinda just wanna hear Isaac sing and take it all in so yeah, some songs have zero crowd singing.  But at the show I went to, they cut King Rat a little early (right before the deeeeep water, deeep water part) and the entire crowd just kept singing and essentially performed the rest of the song. It was pretty cool to be a part of, tbh."
ModestMouse,38gpgb,teddybadman,6,Thu Jun 4 05:36:11 2015 UTC,When I saw them at Forest Hills you can bet your ass that I was singing along like a maniac
ModestMouse,38gpgb,Selffaw,10,Thu Jun 4 15:55:31 2015 UTC,You're not wrong to sing along but I think the typical Modest Mouse fan is the type of asshole that figures I'm here to hear the band play and sing. Not the crowd do karaoke. I may or may not be one of those assholes.
ModestMouse,38gpgb,justaboxinacage,6,Thu Jun 4 03:29:28 2015 UTC,Kind of wrong. People were singing at the Buffalo show I went to in April and nobody seemed to give a fuck.

ModestMouse,38gpgb,justaboxinacage,9,Thu Jun 4 04:22:03 2015 UTC,"From my experience crowd singing unless it's a real definable singalong song is something that doesn't show up in bootlegs and live recordings for a lot of bands, not just Modest Mouse. It depends on where the microphones are or if the recording is from the board. Like when I hear live recordings of Pearl Jam playing to an arena and Eddie turns the mic to the crowd to sing a line themselves then you will defff hear the crowd, but Issac doesn't do that shit really. I saw the band in mid April and people were definitely singing along to some of the more well known songs. I was singing along and sorry but I couldn't give a shit if people don't like it, part of live music to me is about connecting with the band and part of that is singing along to the songs I hold near and dear. And near and dear is how I hold like nearly every MM tune. So go, enjoy the show and unless you have a truly abysmal voice and singing the wrong lyrics - sing along. Or mime the lyrics or whatever. Its your time with Modest Mouse and make the most of that time."
ModestMouse,38gpgb,Right_All_The_Time,3,Thu Jun 4 04:15:42 2015 UTC,Its your time with Modest Mouse and make the most of that time.   You just summarized my feelings on live performances better than I've ever been able to
ModestMouse,38gpgb,Bill__Buttlicker,5,Fri Jun 5 07:28:49 2015 UTC,"Nice. I've seen Modest Mouse live 4 times since 2004, so let's say that's 8 or so total hours in 11 years. And in between those few hours there are countless dozens if not a hundred hours spent listening to their music and loving their music privately. So when I finally get my few hours of time in the company of the same spot with the band I'm going to fucking enjoy it. If I've got a shit spot in the crowd, I'm going to move to a better spot. If they play a song I love, I'm going to sing along, if I dance and the folks around me are total stiffs, I'll move to a spot where the people actually having fun are."
ModestMouse,38gpgb,Right_All_The_Time,3,Fri Jun 5 14:00:50 2015 UTC,Note to self: next time I see Modest Mouse live find where /u/Right_All_The_Time  is and jam the fuck out
ModestMouse,38gpgb,Bill__Buttlicker,-7,Fri Jun 5 16:34:49 2015 UTC,"This is how I feel as well, though I'm always pissed after the show because my singing ruins a lot of my recordings, lol.  tbh even when other people sing I never hear them, it's too loud. Though I've never been to a show where I wasn't 1st-3rd row of bodies in the pit. Guess in seats or toward the back where you're standing it might be different, but that's what you get for being a pussy, lol."

Expect some dumbass to shout song requests as if they don't already have the setlist planned. Seriously the same guy yelled ""SHIT LUCK!"" In between every single song. If you yell something funny Isaac is likely to have a conversation with you while on stage (he seriously talked to me for like 5 minutes and everyone around just stared at me in awe)."

I about shit myself when he put his hand over his eyes to block the lights, looked me dead in the eyes and said ""what's that buddy?"" I repeated myself and he laughed and said something like ""but once you flood the gates, where the fuck do you plan on going?"" I replied with ""let's go party at your house!"" That was the one that initiated an epic Isaac Brock rant in which he talked about his house already being packed and somehow went into talking about his spice rack and how he already has too much curry seasoning."

ModestMouse,38dv7q,spork_br,7,Wed Jun 3 20:19:05 2015 UTC,"Highly doubt it. 1 hit and 2 minor hits does not make a RRHOF band. They deserve it don't get me wrong but they just don't have THAT much mainstream recognition. Look at it this way, Sonic Youth has been eligible for the RRHOF for 5 years and they aren't in. If Sonic Youth of all bands can't get in, the odds for other titans of indie rock like Modest Mouse or Pavement looks slim. Either way I'm sure Isaac couldn't give less of a fuck about the rock n roll hall of fame."

ModestMouse,38algz,Wutangerines,20,Wed Jun 3 02:00:26 2015 UTC,"It'd probably be something similar to like Catcher in the Rye, kind of angsty and anti-establishment (""God if I have to die, you will have to die, etc.) and also really depressed (""In heaven, everything is fine...)  but also full of wisdom and truth shown in a slightly humorous or kind of obscured fashion (""I could have my mind erased and still not know exactly what I don't already know""). Then the main character becomes a murderer (""I gawt my pistowl in the cahr, awhhhhuhh"").   or... The beginning chapter starts with the main character looking up at the sky after watching sunset with a girl on a hillside, both of them drinking beer. She comments on how pretty it is, and he interjects, saying it's stupid and pointless. When the stars come out, they reflect on how lonely it would be to travel in space. On their walk home, they see a scene of a guy who comes up to a jeweled tortoise -- the man kills to tortoise and takes the jewels. The kid tells the girl how pissed off at humanity he is and how fucked humans really are. He drifts away from the girl, eventually finding out she died much later in his adulthood (""when we die, some sink and some lay, but at least i don't see you float away""). In his old and bitter years, he tries to go sober (""need more sleep than coke or methamphetamine"") but fails. Eventually, he walks along, hobbling really, with a cane, when he stumbles across a tortoise. He locks eyes with it, looks up at the sky, and the novel ends before we find out what he does."

ModestMouse,3848hm,Rockasaurus22,3,Mon Jun 1 20:17:13 2015 UTC,This was my immediate thought as well. Angels and demons doesn't seem to fit Pistol remotely.

ModestMouse,3848hm,divingstation,3,Tue Jun 2 19:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think so, too. Lots of references to trees in that one. (Trees drop colorful fruits/Directly into our mouths... All the trees are turning colors now...All the ghosts of trees are coming out)  I wonder if the ""demons"" will sing the chanted part? (We greased all the ropes/We'll throw you a line/We're gonna break these borders/We're gonna pull things out)  On a side note, seeing the clear cut forests here  in Oregon is horrifying. I know they replant the trees, but it's still awful to see the absence."
ModestMouse,3848hm,tinylaugh,2,Wed Jun 3 04:00:23 2015 UTC,It's definitely The Ground Walks With Time In a Box. Fairly certain it's the same director as the last video..  I know a guy who knows a guy who told me that He's currently shooting a video for the RVA metal band Lamb of God. They have to go on tour this week so I bet this MM video should be done pretty soon.

ModestMouse,37lxi9,nedvedcrouch,1 point,Fri May 29 01:31:15 2015 UTC,In dc. I'm in Baltimore and it may be my favorite venue.
ModestMouse,37lxi9,paturner2012,1 point,Fri May 29 04:05:35 2015 UTC,Saw them at the 930 in 2000. That's a difference of math.

ModestMouse,37if5o,viberider,1 point,Thu May 28 17:30:33 2015 UTC,"I've heard of that! My mum picked up this sucker in Colombia and its pretty huge. Has no name brand, but it wasn't cheap. I did replace the needle too but been contemplating finding a decent turntable on a budget"
ModestMouse,37if5o,maxwellsearcy,1 point,Thu May 28 20:13:43 2015 UTC,Those needles...
ModestMouse,37if5o,Styrofoam--Boots,1 point,Fri May 29 01:32:44 2015 UTC,"I've never heard that! I just got a little crosley for 30 bucks new. Is it a needle problem, or does the turntable cause warping? What's the issue?"
ModestMouse,37if5o,brandondh,2,Mon Jun 1 14:54:22 2015 UTC,"Crosleys use technology from the 1950s. Their tonearms have insanely high tracking force, which means their needles dig into the record way harder than they're supposed to, thus ruining them. A standard turntable has a tracking force between 1-1.5 grams, while Crosleys are set around 4.6 grams. That's a huge change in tracking force! They do this because they use ceramic cartridges, which would skate around and skip if not set to an unreasonably high tracking force.  Crosleys also use bottom-of-the-barrel parts for the entire machine too, so the built-in speakers are complete garbage as well. Basically, they are the antithesis of vinyl (sounds like shit and destroys physical media).  Check out /r/vinyl for their various guides on buying used turntables, pre-amps and speakers, you can get a killer system for dirt cheap if you're willing to look around online."

ModestMouse,37j4nr,quizzer106,7,Thu May 28 00:26:20 2015 UTC,"This line up is fucking incredible. I knew in my heart of hearts that Modest Mouse would be playing, but The Pixies, Tenacious D, Coheed and Cambria, and MOTHER FUCKING CLOUD CULT!? Goddamn."

ModestMouse,37j4nr,SnavenShake,2,Thu May 28 15:34:27 2015 UTC,"I would start with Light Chasers, Feel Good Ghosts, and then Love.  I'm from Minnesota (so are they) so I've seen them several times - I even own a couple of their live show paintings (if you watch their youtube live concerts you'll see they have two artists that paint during the shows, its really badass)"
ModestMouse,37j4nr,built_too_spill,6,Fri May 29 16:35:24 2015 UTC,"I can't believe this line up, Modest Mouse, Pixies, Alkaline Trio, Explosions in the Sky, Millencolin, Rancid, Reverend Horton Heat, Get Up Kids, Less Than Jake, The Vandals. It's like all my teenage years phases rolled into one. Insanity."
ModestMouse,37j4nr,justaboxinacage,2,Thu May 28 04:05:59 2015 UTC,YES!!! If Faith No More gets added in the next wave of announcements I'll consider buying a two day pass.. For now though just hoping Modest Mouse and Tenacious D land on the same day. Wow. So glad I finally get to see this band.
ModestMouse,37j4nr,seth227,2,Thu May 28 00:31:24 2015 UTC,Are they also coming to the one in chicago?
ModestMouse,37j4nr,rapeisfunny69,1 point,Thu May 28 04:00:23 2015 UTC,I can't choose between the Chicago one and the Denver one. Fidlar is playing in Chicago but not Denver. And Pixies and Nada Surf are playing in Denver and not Chicago.

ModestMouse,37j4nr,MsMagee,0,Thu May 28 02:19:10 2015 UTC,Last year it was hosted in the parking lot of The Broncos Stadium in downtown Denver.
ModestMouse,37jijh,tinylaugh,5,Thu May 28 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"I'm going to the Missoula show, without a doubt. Who knew that my second MM show would be just a year apart from my first? They have a long history with this city. Obviously, Isaac is originally from Helena, but this was the first date in the US tour for Long Drive, and has been a fairly regular spot since."
ModestMouse,37jijh,StrensmsToothInACan,2,Thu May 28 11:33:10 2015 UTC,"see you there! last year was pretty excellent. i talk about that version of tiny cities, frequently."
ModestMouse,37jijh,flanneled_man,2,Thu May 28 21:08:54 2015 UTC,"Someone tried to mosh during that performance. I got a little thrown around, but it was a blast. That was an incredible performance all together. Broke was another highlight for me.  Mimicking Birds were really incredible, too.

ModestMouse,37jijh,deadkathy,2,Sat May 30 01:42:43 2015 UTC,I might be able to answer a few.
ModestMouse,37jijh,StrensmsToothInACan,1 point,Sat May 30 14:55:34 2015 UTC,"I want to get close to the stage as possible, how early should I show up? Also, will there be any bands opening for them? I mean, I'd think so, but nothing is listed."
ModestMouse,37jijh,deadkathy,2,Sat May 30 16:03:41 2015 UTC,"I would come an hour early. We did it that way, and there was already a pretty long line. The field is pretty large though, and a lot of people like distance to sit on blankets and such. Go right to the front. I'm sure there will be an opening act. I think they just have yet to announce who it is."

ModestMouse,37jijh,deadkathy,1 point,Sat May 30 16:32:28 2015 UTC,Missoula is too tough of a drive for me to make it to. Bet it will be a damn good show tho.

ModestMouse,37i570,tynamite,4,Wed May 27 20:26:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry for such a late post. I was at work when I got the notification and trying to buy a ticket.   I was so confused, I wasn't even sure if it was real cause nothing was announced and not on their website. I almost missed getting a pit ticket. Literally, a couple minutes after getting pit, it was sold out. I'm so lucky I had song kick cause ticket master wasn't selling yet.   IM SO EXCITED! FIRST MM SHOW!"
ModestMouse,37i570,blangatang,3,Wed May 27 20:28:39 2015 UTC,I missed out on the pit :( but I at least experienced it in Tampa. Thanks SO MUCH for posting. I got to secure a ticket in a section near where Isaac usually plays at. I'm driving all the way from Sarasota alone. Viscerally pumped!!
ModestMouse,37i570,blangatang,1 point,Wed May 27 22:00:27 2015 UTC,"Glad you at least got a ticket. I feel bad for posting so late. I was trying to but I was working. I'm driving up alone, too. GF doesn't like MM at all."

ModestMouse,37i570,catdadddd,1 point,Wed May 27 22:44:04 2015 UTC,Will they still have tickets? Everything was pretty much sold out from Song Kick. Still don't know the different between the pre sale on Ticket Master and song kick.
ModestMouse,37i570,blangatang,3,Thu May 28 00:08:00 2015 UTC,Song kick was just pre-sale so a certain number of tickets were allocated. Tickermaster will have more pit tickets available or atleast that has been my experience in the past.
ModestMouse,37i570,catdadddd,1 point,Thu May 28 00:11:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay. Still very excited I got pit ahead of time."
ModestMouse,37i570,blangatang,1 point,Thu May 28 00:25:52 2015 UTC,dang! If I can buy pit tickets on friday I hope I don't get stuck with the one I just got :(
ModestMouse,37i570,catdadddd,2,Thu May 28 02:53:24 2015 UTC,Not sure if song kick does refunds if not just post it on stubhub and make your money back. Getting pit tickets is definitely worth it.
ModestMouse,37i570,LordBridgewater,1 point,Thu May 28 03:05:27 2015 UTC,thanks! I'll get funds together and be ready on friday again.
ModestMouse,37hszf,RiversideRhino,19,Wed May 27 19:06:00 2015 UTC,"Arguably my favourite from the album. The part in the second verse starting ""Well the earth doesn't care"" is an amazing build up and I love it. The song also reminds me of ""March in to the Sea"" which is pretty sweet."
ModestMouse,37hszf,ajdj99,10,Wed May 27 20:32:03 2015 UTC,"""We're just a bit more piss to push out its full bladder.""  I love that line"
ModestMouse,37hszf,JordanSM,3,Wed May 27 21:13:14 2015 UTC,And I need my rocky little bits.
ModestMouse,37hszf,acealeam,2,Wed May 27 21:54:20 2015 UTC,"Yes dude, yes. This song is definitely tops."
ModestMouse,37hszf,maxwellsearcy,7,Mon Jun 1 14:47:56 2015 UTC,"This is probably my favorite from the new album. I have been listening to this song for at least a year now. I used to listen to the live recording, I think from Coachella. It's a great song! Hope he plays it next week in Mountain View."
ModestMouse,37hszf,felicitas04,2,Wed May 27 23:00:05 2015 UTC,It's my fave too. I loved it ever since the coachella version and I'm glad it's getting some love!
ModestMouse,37hszf,spork_br,2,Mon Jun 1 05:20:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I was really looking forward to ""Poison the Well,"" but I guess we won't get it until 2017."
ModestMouse,37hszf,maxwellsearcy,3,Mon Jun 1 14:51:27 2015 UTC,"As someone with anxiety, this song makes me extremely emotional."
ModestMouse,37hszf,Zack_of_Steel,3,Fri May 29 08:09:29 2015 UTC,"Easily my least favourite from the album, and has been since the first listen. (Although the breakdown is pretty sweet)"
ModestMouse,37hszf,Gatorinsti,4,Sat May 30 15:37:59 2015 UTC,"I started off loving it, being one of my favourites from the album, but it got really repetitive. It now lies somewhere in the middle for me. It's like a toned down version of March Into the Sea/Alone Down There."
ModestMouse,37hszf,uplm,3,Thu May 28 03:10:39 2015 UTC,"""Ants will climb around   all them heads of bronze.   At the Parthenon   the ants are climbing on..""   God damn shivers."
ModestMouse,37hszf,ratonMODESTO,1 point,Wed May 27 22:09:46 2015 UTC,"This one's my favorite and has been since the live performances a year or two ago. The classic, repetitive and inspiring Isaac scream of ""be brave!"" and the haunting lyrics, especially the ""Well the earth doesn't care and we hardly even matter..."" stanza, kill me. I can't wait to shout along with this song."

ModestMouse,37hszf,Comatmeskrublord,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:25:09 2015 UTC,Love the energy to this one. Probably my second favorite on the album to just close my eyes and zone out to.
ModestMouse,37g9sj,StrensmsToothInACan,12,Wed May 27 12:19:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this ""after the dust has settled"" review of Strangers.  I agree with you that, though it received some 'meh' type reviews initially, once it settles in, this album is going to become another classic.  It is a solid, well thought out album _as are your thoughts here.  My only suggestion is that you might want to edit the part about Ansel.  Ansel was Isaac's step-brother rather than his brother-in -law."
ModestMouse,37g9sj,MsMagee,7,Wed May 27 15:10:50 2015 UTC,"I really didn't like StO on the first few listens. I set it down for a month. I listened to it again afterwards and went on to listen to it 20 times that week. It really is a fantastic album.  I still don't like Pups to Dust, though..."
ModestMouse,37g9sj,SirKnightCourtJester,7,Wed May 27 14:58:57 2015 UTC,"Funny how people who like the same band can have such different opinions.  I played StO nonstop upon release and absolutely loved it from start to finish.  So much so that I drove my gf a little crazy by constantly listening to it.    Pups to dust is my favourite song from the album and probably in my top 5 modest mouse songs (tho to be fair, those top five songs do shift a lot as I fall in love with previously overlooked songs)."

I would have finished it by now, but my laptop had to get replaced and the .veg file was taken away with it. That means I'd have to finish the final third of this from scratch, and I don't know if I'd be able to."

ModestMouse,37hadm,SnavenShake,1 point,Thu May 28 00:53:04 2015 UTC,I'm convinced they'll be at Riot Fest. With no Denver or Chicago dates announced and the dates of Riot Fest for both shows being unscheduled on their website either it seems super likely.  In fact I am so sure I already purchased one of the early bird three day passes (plus even if they aren't playing Riot Fest usually has a great line up)
ModestMouse,37hadm,seth227,1 point,Wed May 27 17:14:34 2015 UTC,Desperately hoping for Riot Fest. I'll definitely figure out a way to catch the show if they're on the lineup.

At least the Lights Off for Danger album (all I've heard so far). Someone on their bandcamp described it as ""indie comfort food"" and I thought was pretty accurate. Nothing crazy but very solid."
ModestMouse,37gijp,viberider,1 point,Fri May 29 00:31:13 2015 UTC,"I found out about these guys when I was visiting Seattle a few months ago and looking up local PNW bands. They're from Portland, OR and I get a huge Modest Mouse vibe from them without trying to blatantly rip them off (well, except the guitarist/singer's name is Isaac, but he can't help that!).  My favorite songs are Where is Nebraska?, The Sky Was the Color of Television Tuned to a Dead Channel, and Lights off Speak Less. I'm interested to hear what you guys think!"

I really like the instrumentals of Twenty One Pilots, but I can't stand the lead singer. I tried so many times and I can't listen to him. I also like Arctic Monkeys, but all their songs sound the same to me. They sound good, but not varied enough. Although I can definitely see why a lot of people enjoy them."

This was my fifth year at Sasquatch and just about every year there is something wrong with the sound at one or multiple stages.

A little heavy on the Good News tracks, and I would have liked to see ""Coyotes"" as their slower song from StO rather than Strangers or Wicked Campaign. I don't think I should be complaining though.

ModestMouse,37akpc,asmart,1 point,Wed May 27 23:19:54 2015 UTC,"Somebody threw a deck of cards on the stage right before they came out, he picked one up and stuck it to his forehead and said, ""Its a 10. I know cause I looked."" and then went into the heaviest version of Word at Large I've ever seen them play. After that was over he went on to say, ""Thanks to the dickhead who threw a deck of cards at me. What the fuck did you think I'd do with them? Now there's shit all over the ground. You just littered, that's what you did."" He was feisty."
ModestMouse,37akpc,oofig,1 point,Thu May 28 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"ah! thanks.  I saw a comment on the Sasquatch Sub that mentioned something about it.  That fellow didn't go into detail, but expressed something other than feisty.  I prefer feisty."

ModestMouse,37akpc,oofig,2,Thu May 28 02:39:48 2015 UTC,"Ha! perfect!  Yeah I guess if you don't get him you just don't.  So to us he's clever, and to some he's an ass.  I like my version of clever Isaac, I'll keep him."

Actually paying attention to the lyrics and hearing them being sung really makes me take a whole new look at the song and makes me feel like I just heard it for the first time again. I've listened to so much of MM but it always brings a fresh feeling to the songs when you actually dive into the lyrics."

Tracks 16 through 24 on Sad Sappy Sucker were just Isaac messing around on his answering machine (he did a dial-a-song thing with his outgoing mesesage) and K Records had the release rights to them, so they threw them on the CD. You can see which songs they've done live and how many times here at the interstate-8 fan site. All though I'm sure they're missing the records on some very early performances."

ModestMouse,371t90,Styrofoam--Boots,1 point,Sun May 24 04:17:10 2015 UTC,Have any recommendations for a an alternative to Crosley but in the same price range? Or close to it?
ModestMouse,371t90,georgehimself,2,Sun May 24 14:13:33 2015 UTC,"It will largely depend on your location and luck, but buying used is often a great (and cheap) way to get a quality turntable. It's purely anecdotal, but I bought a Technics SL-D2 for $75 from a man on Craigslist early this year and it's been fantastic.  If you want to go new, entry level Rega, Pro-ject, and U-Turn are well regarded, but you'll pay near $200 or more. I'd recommend reading the sidebar on /r/vinyl, but be careful with the newer posts. Many of them are simply repeated questions or pictures of users' possessions - not particularly helpful."

ModestMouse,371t90,The_Commandant,3,Sun May 24 11:43:52 2015 UTC,"I believe the problem is that Crosleys' tone arms aren't counterweighted, so each time you use it the weight of the arm is entirely on the record and it creates scratches and fucks up the grooves.  EDIT: Basically all you can do is get a new, better turntable, sadly."
ModestMouse,371t90,ilive12,2,Sun May 24 11:54:58 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Thanks for the response!

The damage they do won't make the record unplayable, it will just very slightly degrade the audio over time. But if you aren't an Audiophile, chances are it won't matter too much anyway. I've played certain records on my portable crosley probably 50 times, but I haven't noticed too much loss of detail when I switch over to my audiophile setup."

ModestMouse,370ifa,Chawde,4,Sat May 23 18:53:28 2015 UTC,I really enjoy built to spill but I feel like they haven't evolved much in the past 20+ years.  What makes Modest Mouse endlessly enjoyable is the variety throughout there discography.
ModestMouse,370ifa,Srtviper,6,Sun May 24 01:58:52 2015 UTC,"I guess you could say that, although their new album where they strip everything back and go back towards their original sound, may be an evolution of its own. It was really refreshing to hear an album like theirs in 2015, especially after STO, where as I stated in one comment, the production gets in the way of the music"
ModestMouse,370ifa,Srtviper,2,Sun May 24 16:01:02 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong BTS offers a great sound it just gets old for me after a while.

But I figured I might as well make it as interesting as possible, so I am sending out this survey to see if there is a correlation between knowing Built to Spill and being a fan of Modest Mouse. I know that of course there is a corelation! These 2 bands were on the same label and Isaac looked up to Doug Martsch musically. MMs earlier stuff sounds very similar with the chord progressions, long winding song structures  and everything. Personally, I had my Modest Mouse obsession, then through them I discovered Built to Spill and can't stop listening to them now!   My personal opinion of the two bands is this I like them both equally   I find that MM has more intricate and interesting lyrics (not to say that BTS doesn't have interesting lyrics)  But Built to spill has better chord progressions and guitar rifs. (I just think Doug is a better guitar player than Isaac).  Modest Mouse has definitely got better drums, Jeremy wins easy  Bass is a close one, but I have to give the edge to MM and Judy  Best ""fuck it"" attitude, Isaac may be more upfront with it, but I think Doug has got the edge here, with the ballsy release of a not much produced, 90s style alt/indie garage rock in 2015 is just an ultimate ""we are gonna play the music we love to listen to"" attitude  sorry for the rant, but please take survey! Thanks everyone, and feel free to use this a discussion platform for the 2 bands!   edit:typo and formatting  edit2: Also to explain, the first question is really to only one that matters for the project, but I put the other ones just because I'm curious"

ModestMouse,370ifa,Right_All_The_Time,5,Mon May 25 04:53:29 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Modest Mouse and they are arguably my favorite band, Doug's guitar solos are something Isaac could never pull off. Especially the ones on Keep It Like A Secret. That album is just total fucking GUITARPORN"
ModestMouse,370ifa,StrensmsToothInACan,2,Mon May 25 05:54:34 2015 UTC,Agreed. Keep It Like a Secret is the album that really inspired me to play guitar. The fact that they can make a song like Carry the Zero or Time Trap with nothing but traditional instruments and have them sound so out-of-this-world still astounds me. That album (and PFNO) are absolute fucking top-tier guitarporn
ModestMouse,370ifa,StrensmsToothInACan,2,Wed May 27 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"Yup, agree fully. Those searing super melodic guitars on Carry the Zero And Time Trap like you said are unreal."
ModestMouse,370ifa,deadkathy,3,Wed May 27 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"They're both brilliant groups. Both are incredibly hard-working, but simultaneously Hedonistic. I think Built to Spill have a more optimistic view of the world. They're known for doing a slew of cover songs, while Modest Mouse pretty much sticks to the music of theirs that they love to play. They both have that Talking Heads approach to building songs from these brilliant little nuanced repetitions, and then freaking out over them once they're well established. Built to Spill tends to be more sardonic and based on wordplay lyrically, while Isaac is deeply observant of what bothers him about the world, and draws off of that lyrically with potent, surreal imagery. I love them both in their own right, really."
ModestMouse,370ifa,thequietthingsthat,3,Sun May 24 14:10:47 2015 UTC,"That's a really good way to put it. Built To Spill is definitely less serious, and more about funny or odd observation. Like the song ""joyrude""  which straight up mocks and calls out bands like Blink 182.  Definitely more focused on the music then the lyrics. In recent interviews Doug has stated that he struggles with lyrics, and is more interested with the musical side. Although I really do enjoy his lyricism. I've also noticed demeanor difference between the two. Doug seems like a really nice and happy guy, every interview I watch I just go, wow he's a really nice guy. And there's a video of him playing an acoustical performance in the street outside of a show in Boise for the fans who couldn't get in because it was sold out. What and awesome dude. Now don't get me wrong, I love Isaac. But he is very cynical and a bit of an asshole, which is part of why we love them so much. It just depends what your in the mood for! More guitar driven less serious indie rock, or more intricate serious drum driven indie rock."
ModestMouse,370ifa,LameLogan,1 point,Sun May 24 15:59:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. That interview from the Untitled documentary with Doug really highlights his generous demeanor. Also, part of what I love about Isaac's guitar playing is how he's sloppy, but can pull off a lot of things. He purposefully keeps himself uneducated, but still skilled. It's great. Doug's work is a squealing kind of intricate, and I love that too."
ModestMouse,370ifa,tynamite,2,Sun May 24 16:36:38 2015 UTC,That's a great way to put Isaacs guitar playing. Uneducated but skilled :)
ModestMouse,370ifa,tynamite,5,Sun May 24 17:11:12 2015 UTC,"Filled out the survey. I much prefer MM for the emotional punch and wild vocals. And the lyrics, as stated above, are more interesting and clever."
ModestMouse,370ifa,thequietthingsthat,1 point,Sun May 24 00:25:08 2015 UTC,"I think that overall MM has better lyrics and I also like the emotional punch, but I wouldn't underestimate Doug's lyricism either. He can be absolutely brilliant. The lyrics in songs like Randy Described Eternity, Carry the Zero, Kicked It in the Sun, Car, Made-up Dreams, Goin' Against Your Mind, etc. are up there with the best stuff Isaac has written IMO."
ModestMouse,370ifa,thequietthingsthat,1 point,Thu May 28 17:09:03 2015 UTC,"Your thoughts on Doug having a more ""fuck it"" attitude are interesting but I'd have to go with Isaac by a long shot. His music is so much more in your face and full of angst. His lyrics are much more laid out in front of you and he just freaks out on guitar while Doug is more composed. Plus, if you have a song about trying to take out god with a rifle, that's pretty ""fuck it"" to me."
ModestMouse,370ifa,thequietthingsthat,1 point,Sun May 24 05:35:52 2015 UTC,"That's a interesting way to put it. I find Isaac to be more of the ""fuck the world and challenge everything "" type  but I find Doug to be more of a ""fuck we will make the music we want to and if you don't like it we don't care""  which MM definitely had in their earlier stuff, but I feel is losing it currently"
ModestMouse,36zvrn,mywoodenbox,8,Sat May 23 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"I have quoted Isaac, Doug Martsch (Built to spill), and DOOM in essays. I like to pull quotes from music or philosophers to try and tie themes in the books into other art. I've gotten As on all of them (one of my teachers was a huge MM fan). Most notable was I used  ""My brains the cliff and my hearts the bitter buffalo"" to help explain how finding a balance between decisions made from your mind and your heart is key to living happy."

With a green book that had cool-ass art! I downloaded all the shared files I could find and realized that this was the band I'd liked years before , and their older stuff was even better.

I've listened to everything they've released since then with an eager ear and have never looked back. They've been my favourite band for basically as long as i've been listening to music.

It did amazing things for bands that wouldn't be where they are today without the exposure they got from that show, it came round at exactly the right time in terms of where music and the internet was at the time.

I ended up finding to or three more songs (I wasn't very resourceful).   Back in these days AIM and MySpace were big, at least from what I remember, and I had an online friend. A girl that I talked to but had never met, who was a friend of someone I worked with. Well at some point we decide it would be good to meet - and there we get to talking about modest mouse.  Turns out she loves them. Burns me three CDs full of modest mouse songs and the rest was history. (No, I didn't end up with her - I just listened to all the mouse I could find ever after.

I got out of bed and typed a few words into a Google search.   3rd planet. That was the song I heard in my dream. There it was, the song and album that I had heard briefly, months prior.

Turns out I had shit luck and I ended up falling back on working for the music department of a national chain.  I worked long enough to eventually raise enough gas money to limp my classic Chevelle back to my home state (I'm going up, going over to Montana).  Before I did, and while I still had my employee discount at the music store, I asked my buddy for a few ideas of bands I should look into.  My car didnt have a working radio/cd player, so I had a cassette boombox with mixed tapes to listen to for the nearly full day drive.  One of the bands my buddy suggested was Modest Mouse.  He had just been turned onto an album (Lonesome Crowded West, but that was not known at the time) and was raving about it, so I decided to give that band a try.  I eventually decided on one of their albums called ""This is a long drive for someone with nothing to think about""...because it seemed fitting.  I listened to it while I transferred it from the cd I bought to the tape I would be listening to on the road trip.   As you all know, that album starts off with Dramamine.  So it was that special ""love at first sight"" you only see in movies.  By the time Custom Concern finished out the 3rd track....I was hooked for life.  I got 2 other CDs which I made into 2 other tapes for the trip.  At this moment, I couldnt tell you what one of them was and I think the other was Sevendust's first album...but Im not sure.  Needless to say, I spent most of the trip with ""This Is A Long Drive"" playing over and over and over."
ModestMouse,36ykv1,paradigmevo,3,Sat May 23 14:13:46 2015 UTC,"There's something about Modest Mouse that just inherently appeals to Montanans. It's probably the clash of urban  vs. rural that still exists all over the state. We've been holding off mass development for so long, but things seem to be quickening. More and more empty buildings and apartment complexes too expensive for anyone to live in. More public land being sold to big oil and his other nasty destructive brothers. The Lonesome Crowded West still lives and breathes here. But when you can escape to the areas where nature still thrives and breathe the air fresh spit from the trees, you can tell Isaac was inspired by it, because that spirit of the wild keeps every Modest Mouse record swollen."

That month was particularly emotional due to my ex accusing me of a bunch of things so I was going through three different court procedings all at the same time and they all ended within a week of each other. So after two years of accusations and court procedings I was found not guilty of any wrongdoings but through the divorce procedings she gained full custody of our kids and our car and I was awarded more alimony and child support than I made in a month. So yeah, back to relevance, sitting there listening to random play all and wouldn't you know View came on. When it got to the chorus, I started laughing hysterically and crying at the same time. I then dove headfirst into the rest of their stuff. LCW is my favorite now TL;DR Got an album long ago, difficult times happened, The View is amazing."

ModestMouse,36yndi,SamGamesPro,2,Sat May 23 08:52:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I read an interview a bit ago where Isaac talked about the creation process and he said they've actually been working and reworking the album for the majority of the last 8 years, they weren't just taking a break."
ModestMouse,36yndi,platypossamous,2,Sat May 23 09:50:21 2015 UTC,"I love how raw the song is at this point. I love what it evolved into, but he should really release some early recordings of it. HEAR ME ISAAC? I WANT ALL OF IT! PLEASE TAKE MY MONEY!!"
ModestMouse,36yndi,tweak06,1 point,Sat May 23 13:04:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I didn't really point that out in the title. My bad. But you can really see just how much they have put in to this album when you hear that early version and hear how good it sounds. Then you realize that the lyrics are incredibly different and it shows you how much work that eight years consisted of.
ModestMouse,36yndi,roflspammer,2,Sat May 23 13:02:01 2015 UTC,Jeremiah is so fuckin good
ModestMouse,36yndi,anyhistoricalfigure,3,Sat May 23 17:34:53 2015 UTC,yeah. my favorite track for the drums is its all nice on ice alright. or maybe truckers atlas. either way he has some mad fucking chops.

ModestMouse,36p75c,justaboxinacage,14,Thu May 21 00:55:44 2015 UTC,"Cool read! Especially because I've noticed that this imagery is really ubiquitous with the band.   Was there a need for creation? / That was hidden in a math equation and that's this / Where do circles begin?  The universe works on a math equation that never even ever really even ends in the end / Infinity spirals out creation ...  The universe is shaped exactly like the earth / If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were  You were talk talk talk talking in circles that day / When you get to the point make sure that I'm still awake, okay?  Way in the back of the room there sits a cage / Inside is a clock that you can win if you can guess its age / Which you never can do because the time constantly changes  A full-year trip to the exact same spot ...   So on, so on, ad infinitum. This is all just off the top of my head.  In a lot of his songs he seems to be explaining that the world is just one huge Penrose Staircase, and there's no point in trying to solve it because it's unsolvable."

But then I decided that it was probably just Isaac yelling ""God damn."""
ModestMouse,36om3h,Hybridmomentsx,4,Wed May 20 23:48:05 2015 UTC,You mean .. WELL!
ModestMouse,36om3h,echo_astral,4,Thu May 21 11:41:58 2015 UTC,"I love this interpretation of these songs. Beautifully done! Though I definitely grasp these songs as stand alones, I've never picked up on all the correlations between these two particular tracks."
ModestMouse,36om3h,bnarows,4,Wed May 20 23:38:04 2015 UTC,"This is my favorite album from my favorite band and your explanation of these two songs only deepens my love for the album, and the band.  Thank you for posting this."
ModestMouse,36om3h,kiramazing,3,Thu May 21 00:19:19 2015 UTC,I'm a little skeptical of all the connections but the part about the telephone blew my mind. I've listened to those songs countless times and never thought much of those references being related. I think you're on to something there!
ModestMouse,36om3h,divingstation,1 point,Thu May 21 00:12:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! And yeah, I've been reticent to post it because I've been unsure as to how much of these are such stretches that they aren't even worth mentioning. But the telephone one was what made things kind of click."
ModestMouse,36om3h,DiegoGarcia1984,3,Thu May 21 03:28:12 2015 UTC,That telephone connection is fantastic.
ModestMouse,36om3h,divingstation,2,Thu May 21 07:55:45 2015 UTC,"While some of these specific interpretations and connections seem like a bit of a stretch, I've heard this theory before and would take it to be so- maybe for more of the album too, like Cowboy Dan might be the guy who winds up in Styrofoam Boots..."
ModestMouse,36om3h,rustycherry,4,Thu May 21 02:32:10 2015 UTC,"Cowboy Dan might be the guy who winds up in Styrofoam Boots...   That's a cool thought! It would be a really interesting bridge between a song like ""Convenient Parking,"" which is about the city growing like kudzu, and a song like ""Styrofoam Boots."" Certainly fits into the idea that the album is a swipe against this perceived divine right to grow our cities, ergo ""God pushed the city into me, so I'm gonna take him out."" It's appropriate that Dan would be the character to meet his fate (especially wearing boots).  I got a lot of thoughts about what this album means but the Shoeshine/Styrofoam Boots connection, real or imaginary, is the one that was gnawing at me.  I shoulda gone into musicology and wrote a thesis about this shit."
ModestMouse,36om3h,WjB79,3,Thu May 21 05:51:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah a lot of the songs on the album feel like they tie into each other. I interpret ""Trailer Trash"" to be about Dan's childhood and how he ended up with such a nihilistic worldview."
ModestMouse,36om3h,RightAnglePrism,2,Thu May 21 07:58:03 2015 UTC,"I had never made that connection, but from here on out that's how I'm going to think about it."
ModestMouse,36om3h,StrensmsToothInACan,2,Thu May 21 14:56:16 2015 UTC,Awesome fucking post dude. Love this idea and interpretation I've never thought about it this way before. While I liked LCW a fair bit only a couple months ago for whatever reason did I listen to it again and actually really listen to it. LCW is definitely tied for 1st of my favorites with M&A and BNOoS. TLGS and SB have been two of my favorite songs off that album I feel like you really have to know the lyrics that are being sung to hear them a lot.
ModestMouse,36om3h,StrensmsToothInACan,2,Thu May 21 16:56:42 2015 UTC,"While I find this interpretation fascinating, there are some things about the album (and in particular some of the lyrics you quoted) that make perfect sense and are an almost visceral description of feelings and actions and perceptions when doing a certain drug.  I was typing and realized, I had read it better said elsewhere so I will link that.  http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/15932/?&specific_com=73015336459#comments  This guy explains the song (and the true underlying recurring theme of the album) fairly well. And yes, it does have something to do with God, but that's in a way as a byproduct of the ""main topic"" (and Isaac's youthful preoccupation with meaning and theology)."
ModestMouse,36om3h,KnotNotNaught,1 point,Fri May 22 00:58:41 2015 UTC,"I love this theory. Don't worry about pissing off fans; art of all mediums belongs more to the one experiencing it than the artist themselves, and Isaac believes that too. You can take it wherever you want. I like the whole phone theory, because it ties into ""Long Distance Drunk"". It would make sense that God's the Long Distance Drunk, since he's not in control of anything, just like someone inebriated isn't in any kind of control of their body. Then there's the lyric ""Late AM and someone calls you on the telephone/ you want to be by yourself, and all alone"", which is sung through a telephone."
ModestMouse,36o6ac,echo_astral,8,Wed May 20 20:32:15 2015 UTC,I knew they had the same line but didnt realize it went back that far. Cool.

ModestMouse,36n4z7,RiversideRhino,13,Wed May 20 16:31:23 2015 UTC,I really like the song. It grew on me alot. Sort of the peaceful song after Sugar Boats.

ModestMouse,36n4z7,montgors,4,Wed May 20 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"The first time I heard the song I said to myself, huh, so mm is trying to make a killers song!  Still feel the same, but only in the beginning, after that they really bring it into their own style."
ModestMouse,36n4z7,TheSynicalMispeller,2,Wed May 20 21:26:25 2015 UTC,"Yes. I've also heard Phoenix. I think it's the weakest song other than ""Of Course We Know."""

ModestMouse,36n4z7,police-disco-lights,6,Sat May 23 02:29:35 2015 UTC,"Something about how Isaac sings   Well, you know I'm a bastard and we only just met I guess I probably shouldn't wear this big old sign round my neck   Just makes me fall in love with the song, and the light guitar right after it is just beautiful, the production value in this album really is incredible."
ModestMouse,36n4z7,TheSynicalMispeller,8,Wed May 20 21:29:32 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of people hating on it cause its the kinda song that is supposed to appeal to non-Modest Mouse fans and sorta bring them into the band. However, I think it's a great song. The lyrics are clever and it's got a great vibe to it."
ModestMouse,36n4z7,conkedup,6,Wed May 20 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"I love it, and the ""oh woah woah woah this wicked campaign"" part reminds me of the national."
ModestMouse,36n4z7,shrlock,3,Wed May 20 22:39:29 2015 UTC,"I love the imagery that it opens with. A soul lightening pause in life's struggles.  Perhaps placed on the album after Sugar Boats to signify a chance to stop if even for a short while to look around, wiping off the glasses to see things more clearly after the determined, almost cheerful, good bye vibe from Sugar Boats."

The line ""I just learned my face, but I forgot my name, I'm gonna wear this smile like it's some stupid toupee"" just made me laugh out loud and feel a bit better about my shit job, my not so where I wanna be life. My age and my finally SEEING myself but no longer remembering the ""person"" I named myself to be in my youth. I dunno, I just got it. That and ""I've still got opinions that I'm willing to claim, I'm gonna carry them around like they're some wicked campaign"". Different parts of the song but part of the same feeling of groking."

When you say we make the album, are you suggesting we take a vote for which songs, or...? Do we have a vote for each track one at a time? Like first we vote on what track 1 should be and then move on to track 2? Or do we vote on what all the tracks should be, and then vote on their play order?"
ModestMouse,36no0q,plasticgrass5,1 point,Thu May 21 01:07:59 2015 UTC,I just wanted to start a discussion but you're right. I wonder what the best way to go about it would be. How many songs to limit it to and how to decide the order of tracks. I would think voting to find the playlist first and then voting for the order once the songs are locked would be the best way to go.   There's an entire subreddit devoted to these community created albums so we have plenty of examples to go off of. I can start digging around and see what others have done.
ModestMouse,36no0q,panzerfausten,2,Thu May 21 03:25:27 2015 UTC,"My idea:   See what everyone feels the album should be. Do we make it a themed album? Is it a compilation of their B-Sides? Is it a fan made greatest hits album? Decide length, I say it must be under 120 minutes.  Have everyone make a track list and explain their reasoning. Eg: I picked ""March into the Sea,"" ""The Whale Song,"" and ""Ocean Breathes Salty"" because oceans and shit.  Vote on the lists and then have someone mix the winning one to equalize and make it sound tight as fuck."
ModestMouse,36no0q,maxwellsearcy,2,Thu May 21 15:05:27 2015 UTC,"I'm with you.   Style - I think we should let everyone shout out what songs they want instead of deciding upfront it's going to be a B-Sides album vs. a themed album though. I feel like that limits us on the songs. From the other subreddit albums the goal is to create a mix of songs that someone who never heard the band (at least outside of Float On) can get a taste of what they bring to the table musically.   Length - under 120 for sure. They do have some great long songs but 90 mins sounds like a good length to shoot for.  ""Oceans and shit"" LOL! I love it!  I had an idea of starting a thread with one song per reply and the highest point songs get chosen but then realized I can only reply to my thread once unless I keep replying to my reply's.  Any thoughts on how to find the most popular songs based on everyone's picks?"
ModestMouse,36no0q,wiggerliciousIII,2,Fri May 22 01:34:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe two songs from each album and EP voted on by the community? I agree with the length of less than 120 minutes.  For mixing the tracks, I think looking at set lists from the past years would be helpful"
ModestMouse,36no0q,maxwellsearcy,2,Sat May 23 00:34:23 2015 UTC,What about a cover reddit album? Many of us has some recordings!

ModestMouse,36j5zz,roflspammer,9,Tue May 19 19:48:48 2015 UTC,I was not expecting this!!!  Now all we need is a reissue of Sharpen Your Teeth.
ModestMouse,36j5zz,Srtviper,3,Tue May 19 20:14:28 2015 UTC,"that would be amazing!! Since this was an Epic release and I8 hit wax, maybe Baron Von Bullshit will see vinyl as well??? It'd be nice to have a proper live album that doesn't sound like crap and costs a fortune. Looking at you Live in NYC..."
ModestMouse,36j5zz,davey101,1 point,Wed May 20 03:48:27 2015 UTC,I wonder how well that would sell?  Is there much demand for live albums apart from the more devoted fans?  Although that's not to say I wouldn't buy it in a heart beat because I would.  I just wounder if they would be motivated to not only just reissue it but bring it to a completely new medium.
ModestMouse,36j5zz,Srtviper,2,Wed May 20 04:00:19 2015 UTC,"I8 is a good example. It's got Modest Mouse attached to it, sure. Beyond the devoted fan base I can't imagine anyone going crazy for that re-release seeing as it was a $40 CD on ebay for the past five years and it was a relatively unknown EP. I was very surprised it came out on vinyl."
ModestMouse,36j5zz,davey101,3,Wed May 20 04:09:49 2015 UTC,"relatively unknown EP.   I don't know about that. I mean, if we're talking about among Modest Mouse fans, among the generation who only knew what was available on the CD racks, Building Nothing was considered a pretty legit album. It's not an EP, it's LP length. Before Good News came out, I think it may have had as much or more play than Long Drive. It wasn't until later when Internet discographies started casting it aside into the ""compilations"" or ""singles and EP's"" category that it started to get lost in the shuffle. I'd be interested in seeing album sales for Building Nothing vs. Long Drive.  edit: my bad, I could have sworn that said Building Nothing when I started typing the above. Maybe you changed it?"

ModestMouse,36bff3,justaboxinacage,14,Mon May 18 00:41:38 2015 UTC,"Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down your own damn soul   I interpret it as Isaac spitting God's words back at him, demanding him to explain all that’s going on. To lay down the details of why we’re here and what we’re doing, because ""we just do not know""."
ModestMouse,36bff3,cheerio39,3,Mon May 18 03:56:34 2015 UTC,"The best part is the last line where he says ""of course we know""...it goes back to the Philosopher Alan Watts saying "" We are playing a game of life where we pretend that we don't know why we are here.""   Isaac is a genius..."
ModestMouse,36bff3,gcola12,4,Tue May 19 00:20:31 2015 UTC,"This wouldn't work because Jesus isn't commanded to by God. He knows he is God and just kinda does it. The whole Trinity thing is weird (catholic doctrine) but in essence, there are 3 parts of one God, and the function both independently and as one. Anyways, it wouldnt make much sense for God to command Jesus to lay down his life. Sort of implies he doesn't know to already do that"
ModestMouse,36bff3,jjdore20,1 point,Mon May 18 01:33:09 2015 UTC,"Well that part of the theory was a little more frivolous, but anyways I'm not sure if getting the bible exactly right would matter to Isaac's lyrics. You're probably right, though, God commanding Jesus probably isn't exactly what he's going for. Maybe just God commanding in general."
ModestMouse,36bff3,brtt150,2,Mon May 18 02:09:42 2015 UTC,"This is how I interpret it: God is allegedly omnipotent and thus when a person dies it is ""part of the plan"". To me, this song ties directly back to Ansel (""You can't know"") and his untimely death. So, Brock is angrily demanding God to die instead."
ModestMouse,36b8yp,daebat,6,Sun May 17 23:41:30 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't do that, they always play some old songs at their shows and there wouldn't be time for both"

ModestMouse,36b8yp,T00N,2,Mon May 18 01:57:06 2015 UTC,"No, but I'm sure you could find individual songs played live on YouTube."
ModestMouse,36b8yp,Right_All_The_Time,2,Mon May 18 02:28:05 2015 UTC,Nope. That's not the Modest Mouse way. Judging by the audience reaction at the Buffalo show I went to a month ago people don't know Strangers To Ourselves THAT well to digest the whole thing.
ModestMouse,36b8yp,ConnorCG,1 point,Mon May 18 04:49:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, MM puts out like four singles per record so it's tough to alienate a crowd like that.

Would be pretty epic if MM did it too but oh well :)"

I remember having all of them plus about 40-50 others all loaded into a playlist on WINAMP. There were some amazing track variations, random Isaac banter, jam sessions.. you name it.  There is a version of Cowboy Dan where he mumbles I Came As a Rat lyrics during the slow part and it all slowly leads back into the heavier part of Cowboy Dan. There are shows where you can tell Isaac is too drunk to really be performing, and there are setlists played to perfection that will give you goosebumps. All kinds of stuff like that. I remember listening to it from the 1995 stuff to most present. It is like traveling through a Modest Mouse time machine. Oh man this collection needs to be available to the people!

And yes, if I didn't want to share what I have, I wouldn't have said anything. :P The thing is, I know there are still a LOT more shows out there that I don't have. One in particular that I've been hoping to come across again is the DVD of 9/25/01. The show from the next night, 9/26/01, circulates pretty freely, but the one from 9/25 seems to have disappeared from the internet. I know it exists because I had it at one point and still have a low-quality conversion of it I made, but I deleted the original because I was dumb.  Anyway, I'll look into finding a good flash drive and we'll work out the details as far as getting it to you."
ModestMouse,3681fl,cheaha,3,Sun May 17 05:34:00 2015 UTC,Sounds good man. This is very exciting. This is monumental for any fan of the band.
ModestMouse,3681fl,Sparkle-horse,3,Sun May 17 06:09:38 2015 UTC,"Please keep me updated on this, I have been looking for something like this for a few years.  Cheers to both you gents"

Keep me posted on the flash drive and let me know if anything can be done on my end to help the process move along. Thanks again man, means a lot to me and I'm sure tons of others.  edit - I cannot express to you how much I appreciate you for doing this. I am listening now and getting chills down my spine. Damn near fighting back tears. I remember this show so specifically. It is a very nostalgic rush of good feels. I am there in my mind as I type this. I am so grateful for technology and the internet right now."

ModestMouse,3681fl,built_too_spill,2,Tue May 19 17:17:58 2015 UTC,That 1-15-2000 Crystal Ballroom show is amazing.  My favorite version of Trailer Trash (my favorite MM song) comes from that show.
ModestMouse,3681fl,StrensmsToothInACan,2,Tue May 19 21:21:23 2015 UTC,God I wish I could have been at this show..
ModestMouse,3681fl,Wheneveryouseefit,2,Sun May 17 09:20:04 2015 UTC,A site that had audio/video bootlegs contributed by many would be incredible. I have a few good shows that I havent seen online I would contribute to.

ModestMouse,367kks,HlGHsenberg,1 point,Sat May 16 22:54:39 2015 UTC,I like it. Your voice is pleasant.   The only complaint I have is that it feels a bit rushed. Almost like it's played at 1.5x speed.

It was Lampshades on Fire that really pushed me over for this tattoo.  As I said, I had the idea for years, then Lampshades on Fire said exactly how I felt and what this tattoo was going to be about.  I am going to get a rocket ship on the ditch of my knee next, then a nebula on my quad."

ModestMouse,364vz3,LameLogan,2,Sat May 16 05:50:45 2015 UTC,'King rat' was good but I am a sucker  for 'Tiny cities made of ashes'.  I am a huge fan so it was all so amazing.

ModestMouse,35zdbw,kultcher,2,Fri May 15 00:22:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I really wanted to have each song feel connected to each other in some way, and since lyrics are a big part of what makes Modest Mouse so great, I felt like lyrics should've been a top priority to drawing parallels."

ModestMouse,35zdbw,im_the_fart_man,1 point,Fri May 15 05:48:34 2015 UTC,Hi. I've been looking for people interested in MM to help me with something. I've been listening to an extended version of Spitting Venom and I was wondering if anyone knew the lyrics to 2 sections where he slurs a bit. I can't make out what song they are from. I'm aware there are parts from King Rat and I Came As A Rat. But I don't know the other 2. I made a reddit for it if you care to help. Thanks in advance.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/33tx5t/modest_mouse_spitting_venom_extended_version_help/

ModestMouse,35zdbw,shitcock55,7,Sat May 16 01:21:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, pull that back for a moment, please.  I want to know exactly why you call this cringeworthy. I spent a lot of time on it, and I created a story out of one of my favorite albums from one of my favorite bands.  Who the hell made you the boss?  Edit: If you call it cringeworthy because of how much time I spent on it, I should let it be known I write stories all the damn time. This time I just got inspired by an album, and wrote something I enjoyed. I think that's constructive enough."
ModestMouse,35zdbw,im_the_fart_man,3,Sat May 16 02:19:00 2015 UTC,for sure don't explain yourself to the fart man. creative writing is awesome and I'm glad you shared.

ModestMouse,3608gt,alltomata,7,Fri May 15 00:12:40 2015 UTC,"Well, it doesn't make you crazy to mishear lyrics but I have always heard ""remember through sounds"""
ModestMouse,3608gt,Chait-hei,3,Fri May 15 01:19:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other commenter, heard ""her"" until I finally looked up the lyrics and realized it really was ""through""; but it was too ingrained in my head, and I also liked that it made the song slightly more romantic if that's the right word. So I'm sticking with ""her""!"
ModestMouse,3608gt,A_Mediocre_Time,2,Fri May 15 10:17:44 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was ""her"", but once I looked it up and re-listened I realized it was ""through"", but I decided to ignore that because part of the beauty of Isaac's lyrics are that they can be interpreted in so many ways. I felt that remembering ""her"" sounds, smells and colours made it more personal and relatable to my situation and what I needed (during devastating heartbreak lol)."

ModestMouse,3608gt,Whalekin,1 point,Fri May 15 19:15:41 2015 UTC,"I seriously cannot hear ""through"" in that part of the song, it's always been ""her"" to me, it's just more relatable.   However, given that the song is widely agreed (I think) to be about urban expansion I think ""through"" makes more sense, since ""her"" is about a person and ""through"" is implied to be about a town.  I admire Isaac's ability to sing things in the most ambiguous way possible lol. Sometimes it's a tiny bit frustrating but most of the times it makes the song more personal and subjective."
ModestMouse,360kmx,uber_space_whale,3,Fri May 15 02:03:25 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not the same chords, but it's a similar progression and strum pattern. I could see why you say it sound similar."

I was big into that album before I left for basic training and this song and a few others got my through our runs we had to do in the morning. I would just sing it in my head and completely zone out. I also would get bored during our classes and since I'm a terrible drawer, I'd write lyrics all over my booklet we received.  I'll post a picture of some examples if anyone cares to see.  I love the symbolizism in the song as well."

ModestMouse,35u8u7,Right_All_The_Time,2,Wed May 13 18:16:04 2015 UTC,I would argue Pavement.
ModestMouse,35u8u7,Jackalaka,2,Wed May 13 23:01:47 2015 UTC,"This is true. In their day, Pavement was the definitive American Indie Rock Band, they basically took the reigns from Sonic Youth. But they broke up 16 years ago. I think Modest Mouse are now known as that band with the definitive American Indie rock sound who got mainstream popular on a couple of songs and have a pretty loyal fanbase."
ModestMouse,35u8u7,Right_All_The_Time,3,Thu May 14 02:01:52 2015 UTC,Despite not having been on an indie level for 15 years.
ModestMouse,35u8u7,Right_All_The_Time,9,Wed May 13 18:16:19 2015 UTC,They're still definitely indie...
ModestMouse,35u8u7,chefwafflezs,4,Wed May 13 19:50:31 2015 UTC,"That's the problem with defining a type of music by the distribution method. They're not indie, in the sense of they're not ""independent"" -- they're signed to Epic Records, a division of Sony Music.  Of course, they're ""indie"", in the sense of the sound of their music."
ModestMouse,35u8u7,zck,1 point,Wed May 13 21:02:18 2015 UTC,Don't they distribute through Brock's Glacial Pace Records? What's the distinction between Glacial Pace and Epic?
ModestMouse,35u8u7,Theoddonewhoknocks,2,Sat May 16 06:27:51 2015 UTC,"Don't they distribute through Brock's Glacial Pace Records?   Do they? My copy of Strangers to Ourselves says it's ""Distributed by Epic Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment"". Glacial Pace isn't listed anywhere on the album. Certainly Glacial Pace sold it, but I don't know how that fits into being a ""distributor"". Corporations are complicated.  The wikipedia page for Isaac says it ""used to be a subsidiary of Epic Records, but is now independent"". It doesn't cite this.  If I had to guess, I'd say that Modest Mouse signed a multi-record deal with Epic a while ago, so they can't release albums through other labels. But Isaac can use Glacial Pace to record and promote other bands.  Also notable: he used to do A&R for Sub Pop, a label which is 49% owned by Warner Music Group."
ModestMouse,35u8u7,zck,1 point,Sat May 16 06:52:48 2015 UTC,"I saw the glacial pace sticker that came with my copy, and I didn't expect them to include that if the music was produced by another company. I don't know how the term ""distributor"" fits in either. I mean, if Epic is the distributor, then clearly the label I bought it from (Glacial Pace) isn't the distributor. But they distributed it to me... I don't understand.  That sounds like a good guess! I just finished this huge paper on indie rock as a genre, and it turns out that it's way more corporate than my naive self had previously believed. This looks like just another example of that."
ModestMouse,35u8u7,Theoddonewhoknocks,2,Sat May 16 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"But they did define what it is, more or less."
ModestMouse,35u8u7,anyhistoricalfigure,6,Wed May 13 19:44:33 2015 UTC,Little bit off-topic but has anyone here successfully converted MM to any of your friends? Every time i try to play anything from them i think my friends might like they seem to just not like the band. I've basically come to the notion that you either love MM or hate em.
ModestMouse,35u8u7,CapoThirdFret,6,Wed May 13 21:08:46 2015 UTC,"I have! The key is to start them with the later stuff. ""Dashboard"" is an instantly charming song, and you follow that with ""Missed the Boat"" and ""Bukowski."" When you think they're ready, throw in ""King Rat.""

I liked Float On and Dramamine before I'd ever even met him, but I couldn't stand any of the other songs. I think The View and One Chance were the two songs he played me that made me actually give MM a shot. Dashboard and Little Motel were also two of the ones he used to ease me into them too."
ModestMouse,35u8u7,Rhinocerotic,1 point,Fri May 15 19:37:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, their newer albums like We Were Dead are much more accessible. I think that going backwards through their discography is the best way to get someone sucked in."
ModestMouse,35u8u7,Right_All_The_Time,1 point,Fri May 15 22:00:17 2015 UTC,MM is a bit of a hard sell for some people I find. It's the dynamic of Isaac singing pretty vs Isaac singing loud and brash. Some people just love the pretty singing and can't stand the other stuff.

ModestMouse,35xos2,raining_picnic,1 point,Thu May 14 15:15:00 2015 UTC,"I feel the exact same. Not a disappointment, just not as good as the other records. You gotta consider, though, the others are really hard to live up to."
ModestMouse,35xos2,swampsounds,7,Thu May 14 17:30:54 2015 UTC,"Im a sound engineer and I can say with 100% positivity that there is NO autotune on this album. On the track ""Pistol"", Isaac used a stereo pair of pressure-sensitive omnidirectional microphones that were then ran through an echo chamber. My only complaint with this album was how low-end heavy it was. I still think that there are five or six tracks that absolutely shine on this album (my personal favorite is The Best Room)."
ModestMouse,35xos2,gtnover,0,Thu May 14 15:44:34 2015 UTC,Really? What about time walks? Isaac certainly sounds like he's autotuned if not some other similar process.
ModestMouse,35xos2,ratonMODESTO,2,Thu May 14 17:28:55 2015 UTC,voice filters =/= autotuning  Also maybe Isaac has just improved his singing? That kind of happens after 20 years.
ModestMouse,35xos2,gtnover,2,Thu May 14 22:23:39 2015 UTC,I've found songs become better lyrically when you connect them to specific situations. The album hasn't been out long enough to do that I don't think
ModestMouse,35xos2,wiggerliciousIII,-1,Thu May 14 13:12:26 2015 UTC,"I just feel like all of the lyrics on the album are about how badly humans treat the earth, and while I do find that issue important, I don't find it as relatable as other lyrics from other albums."
ModestMouse,35xos2,raining_picnic,6,Thu May 14 14:34:28 2015 UTC,the way we feel about what we do is by who has watched us
ModestMouse,35xos2,modestlybuilt,-1,Thu May 14 15:47:38 2015 UTC,"Normally the themes are in the music. WWD was nautical, M&A was outer spacey. I agree the theme was lyrically this time more than music, so we get a better variety of sounds, at the cost of variety of lyrics. Overall this is my least favorite album released by them, but that could change. I love sugar boats, ansel, be brave, shit in your cut, pups to dust, wicked campaign, tortoise and tourist, best room, and ground walks.   But you're right, they all have the same message. The songs that I don't like as much are better lyrically though. Coyotes, strangers, and of course we know have great lyrics, but repetitive instruments.  We can nitpick all we want, still the best album of the last few years."
ModestMouse,35xos2,ratonMODESTO,1 point,Thu May 14 15:55:24 2015 UTC,"Look through the discography, and maybe with the exception of Long Drive/Lonesome Crowded West, they changed their sound significantly with every subsequent release. There isn't really any ""old"" Modest Mouse in a meaningful sense - M&A is way different from LCW, Good News from M&A, We Were Dead from Good News, and now Strangers from We Were Dead.  I do prefer their lo-fi stuff before these last couple albums. But it's not really fair to say that this album was a huge change and everything before it is their ""old style"". I also felt the lyrics are less relatable, but they're still of consistent quality so it didn't bother me. Isaac seems more or less satisfied with his own life, so he's thinking about wider issues."
ModestMouse,35xos2,calmerthanudude,0,Thu May 14 15:05:05 2015 UTC,"I think that the songs you mentioned are pretty good, along with most of the songs on the record. But none of them had that feel where I was just like really into it and kind of awe inspiring that they usually deliver."

The MM influence is very apparent and in this case that's a good thing. I like when people share music here but really appreciate it when it's fully realized art like this and not just a song or two hoping to associate themselves with MM.

I think I'm gonna give the album some more listens. It takes a bit for songs to grow on me but if you can get the echo in my head I'll keep coming back. 'Jacki Brady Swims' is very old-esque Modest Mouse. And I really love the composition of 'Jack Brady Grows'. Excellent job on this, you should be proud.

ModestMouse,35pndl,Dukeofstuff,4,Wed May 13 09:09:05 2015 UTC,"I'm really happy you dig it! I'm real self-conscious about sharing my work with strangers, so it's nice to see the positive feedback its getting. Unfortunately I didn't write that monologue at the end of Dead is God, it's Ravi Zacharias reading Nietzsche's ""parable of the madman"". The idea behind the song is that we put so much value into God and whether or not he exists, rather than placing value in the principles that a ""God"" would exhibit (love thy neighbor etc). In the song I say ""god is dead ain't that a shame, you'll never learn to love again"" which is basically the atheist in me saying do we really need a magic man in the sky to teach us how to love? It's a tongue-in-cheek response to people who think atheists are useless degenerates who just want to watch the world burn. TL;DR god doesn't have to exist for us to be good to each other."

ModestMouse,35m51y,echo_astral,6,Mon May 11 18:54:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's like /u/MsMagee said, in that people see the album as MM selling out.   But some of my favorite songs are on that album. Black Cadillacs and Bukowski are awesome songs, as are a lot of the songs on the album. Blame It On The Tetons is another of my favorites.   Whether they ""sold out"" or not, I appreciate good music and there was a lot of damn good music on that album."
ModestMouse,35m51y,Lt_CowboyDan,1 point,Mon May 11 20:22:38 2015 UTC,"I always told people (at the time of GNFPWLBN's release) ""It isn't selling out when you have put out 8 god-tier EP's and albums. It is just the recognition they have deserved all along.""

ModestMouse,35m51y,justaboxinacage,10,Thu May 14 05:58:08 2015 UTC,"I think that part of the hating lavished on Good News is the idea that they ""Sold Out' and that was the first really mainstream album.  So it is as much of a non-conformist judgment as it is a judgment based on the merits of the album.  I don't think they sold out.  They are realists and know that if they want to continue to make the music we want to hear, and also want to raise their families, pay utilities and buy groceries they must sell something.  They are judicious in what, and how much, they sell to afford them the ability to make music and earn a living.  None of these guys are living extravagantly."
ModestMouse,35m51y,CapnEdward,6,Mon May 11 19:39:20 2015 UTC,"I think the general consensus here is that all their albums are pretty good. You're preaching to the choir in here. I mean, my 7th favorite Modest Mouse album is still in my top 100, shit, maybe even top 30 to 50 albums of all time."
ModestMouse,35m51y,forgivedurden,5,Mon May 11 20:09:21 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. How can you hate an album that has an overall theme of ""hang in there, shit gets better""?"

How could any fan not appreciate so many of the excellent songs on Good News, especially if their main problem is that it was simply very successful?"
ModestMouse,35m51y,thequietthingsthat,2,Mon May 11 20:37:17 2015 UTC,I remember watching VH1 when I would get home from middle school just to see the video for Float On. I thought it was the best thing ever.

ModestMouse,35m51y,mcshmeggy,2,Mon May 11 20:20:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm kind of a M&A purist (favorite MM album and 2nd or 3rd favorite album of all time) but Good News is a fucking fantastic album and anyone who says otherwise is full of shit. I don't think there's a bad song on there. Also, I love This Devil's Workday and Dance Hall. Not sure why they get so much shit."

Suggestion here from a pale un-inked individual...use your BNOOS concept but use a different subject such as a ship or  # or diner or iceberg (not a lampshade though).
ModestMouse,35kn49,divingstation,15,Mon May 11 07:13:36 2015 UTC,"I just love the whole sound of it. The banjo, the horns, the incoherent ramblings of an unhinged man. Beautiful stuff."

The way the song just keeps building and relaxing is like a rollercoaster ride throughout, and it completely changes by the time you reach the end, but never breaks the continuity of the song. The way it does that so much reminds me of Teeth Like God's Shoeshine right off the bat, but there are many fantastic songs by Modest Mouse which do the same thing, while of course bringing a different, unique mix to the table."

I looked at other Modest Mouse songs and I then realized just why I appreciated them more than any other artist.   ""We choked on straight tap water well I'm gonna have to try the real thing  I took your lab by the collar and it knew not to swing  Anytime I tried an honest job well the till had a hole and ha-ha  We laughed about payin' rent 'cause the county jails they're free""   I love Modest Mouse because of how astoundingly amazing Isaac is with writing lyrics. They're so complex, and I love music that talks about much bigger topics than more simple problems like depression or love like a major percentage of music ends up talking about.  And don't get me wrong, tons of artists I listen to stick to those simple kind of lyrics, but Modest Mouse is my favorite artist for a reason, and this is the biggest one. they also sound rowdy and kickass in one track, then depressingly beautiful in the next."
ModestMouse,35kn49,Jax3636,3,Wed May 13 03:06:07 2015 UTC,"This song by itself is one of my favorite songs ever. But this combined with the music video, elevates it to one of the greatest pieces of cinematic art I've ever had the privilege to experience."

ModestMouse,35il2y,MsMagee,3,Mon May 11 18:56:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks, hadn't noticed.  I'm thinking that they must choose to sell the rights to the one song on each album which they know will get over played by the radio stations anyway and then keep the rest for us. Float On being the other example."
ModestMouse,35il2y,divingstation,3,Sun May 10 20:03:04 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to me how the second track on each of their recent albums is always an incredibly catchy pop hit. All of 'em are great songs, so I don't mind!"

ModestMouse,35iwqh,tynamite,3,Sun May 10 21:51:21 2015 UTC,"It's not exact, but I'm doing this the entire song, whereas in the actual song sometimes they'll go down instead of up (as noted with ""*""):  NOTE: Tuned half-step down (Eb Tuning)    V1 - Capo on 2:    Capo-Relative Chord Tab    A (x 0 2 2 2 x)   Db (x 4 2 2 2 x)   D (x 5 4 2 3 x)   F#m (*) (2 4 4 2 2 x)      V2 - Capo on 4:    Capo-Relative Chord Tab    G (3 2 0 0 0 3)   B (x 2 x 0 3 x)   C (x 3 2 0 1 x)   Em (*) (0 2 2 0 0 0)    I hope this helps. Since it's tuned in Eb and I'm using a capo, it's a little weird if you wanted to play anything on another instrument. I think this translates to:  Eb Tuning: B -> Eb -> E  Standard: Bb -> D -> Eb"

ModestMouse,35ho6p,RiversideRhino,26,Sun May 10 13:52:20 2015 UTC,Favorite song on the new album! It's just crazy and I love the octave thing they do with the later Bye Byes. It's a pretty wild ride and the song has a lot of progression like you'd find in stars are projectors or cowboy Dan or something.   It reminds me also a lot of steam egenius for some reason (tempo?) Which was my favorite off of we were dead
ModestMouse,35ho6p,wobowobo,17,Sun May 10 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"My favorite song off the album. Definitely in the same feel of songs like This Devil's Workday and King Rat. There is so many layers to this song and it gets crazy during the ""bye"" verse. Hope they play it live when I see them in August!"
ModestMouse,35ho6p,companion_kubu,6,Sun May 10 15:36:27 2015 UTC,"They did play it at the concert I went to (OKC). It was the second song right after Strangers to Ourselves. It was a great live song, I hope you see it as well."

ModestMouse,35ho6p,dromanoster,5,Sun May 10 16:03:14 2015 UTC,The first time I listened to the album this song stood out the most to me. I'm sure it would be in my top 10 modest mouse songs if I could ever choose them.
ModestMouse,35ho6p,divingstation,3,Sun May 10 16:50:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I said ""oh, shit!"" out loud when that opening piano riff came in for the first time."
ModestMouse,35ho6p,some1onredditsaidit,2,Mon May 11 07:25:01 2015 UTC,"I love this song live. The album version doesn't do it justice. The bass sounds like a tuba in the guitar chorus, which I'm not big on. It also sounds like the drums, which sound heavy and rocking live, are played with really thin sticks, which doesn't make sense. If the whole song sounded like the outro it would be better."
ModestMouse,35ho6p,beard_lover,2,Sun May 10 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"This song is so great. The energy, the lyrics, and the overall sound is awesome. It's definitely my favorite song on the album."
ModestMouse,35ho6p,relberso98,1 point,Mon May 11 06:16:47 2015 UTC,When Isaac said that he was obsessed with every little sound and every little detail of this album I like to think he thinks about this song in particular. There are so many things going on in this song and they all work so well together. Far and away the best song off the album and might even be too of all time favorite MM songs honestly.
ModestMouse,35ho6p,thequietthingsthat,1 point,Mon May 11 19:31:27 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love this track. It definitely has a ""classic"" Modest Mouse feel to it. The ""WELL""'s, the banjo, Isaac going back and forth between soft and loud vocals, etc. Fucking awesome song."
ModestMouse,35ho6p,phencer42,1 point,Wed May 13 15:43:53 2015 UTC,"I really like this song a lot and it's probably my favorite at the moment off of StO. Amusingly, I feel like they're channeling a bit of Of Montreal especially for the beginning of the track. That might just be me though."
ModestMouse,35ho6p,acealeam,1 point,Wed May 13 16:24:17 2015 UTC,"I was bored so I decided to write up an analysis for this song.  ""this rock of ours is just some big mistake  and we will never know just where we go  or where we have came from  these veins of mine are now some sort of fuse  and when they light up and my mind blows up  my heart is amused  so this heart of mine is just some sort of map  that doesn't care at all or worry about where the hell you're at  but you're right there""  The first section is about the earth, how life on this rock was just a mistake and nothing really matters. The human race doesn't want to learn anything (a theme shared with Of Course We Know at the end of the album).  Next we move on to a personal standpoint of the narrator. He claims his veins are a fuse leading to his brain, and when they light up, his brain blows up. This could represent the beginnings of depression, the brain blowing up into a container of dread. His heart  (sympathetic side) doesn't connect with people anymore due to this depression, and he feels disconnected with friends and family who are ""right there"" for him.  ""well i've been meaning to dismiss you yeah  i have some plans to dismiss you  so stand by, by, bye bye, bye bye  wave bye sugar boats  as soon as you paint ever last grain of sand  as you, soon as you paint ever star in the   sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky  wave bye sugar boats""  He's been wanting to tell people how he feels, but he can't really at the moment. The sugar boats represent a way of suicide (The purpose of a boat is to float on water, but sugar dissolves in water) and he gets distracted by these thoughts. ""wave bye sugar boats"" is the act of suicide, waving bye to the sugar boats as they leave the dock into it's demise. ""Painting"" sand and stars represents people trying to help him feel better, telling him stuff like ""everything will be better"" and ""life is worth living"", but to him this is just people covering up the truth and they'll have to wave bye to the sugar boats.  ""well i'm swatting at the mosquitoes as they are orbiting me  i'm orbiting the sun and this goes on and on and on you see  this heart of mine is just some broke machine   and when it gets going, and it often gets a going  it starts blowing steam  here we go again""  Mosquitoes orbit him, the Earth orbits around the sun, the sun revolves around in the galaxy and so on and so forth. This could mean he feels insignificant due to these facts, that he's just some mosquito sucking to the Earth's resources. Again we return to his sympathetic side, which is completely broken now. He is getting anger issues from this which makes him ""blow steam"".  ""this rock of ours is just some big mistake   and we will never know just where we go  or where we have came from  this watch of mine is like some sort of void  because when i look in, and i shouldn't look in,  i see it swallow my time  oh no there is goes!""  Time is passing by fast for him as he grows over, and all he is doing in life is wasting it and not doing anything important. (Not much to say about this verse).  ""i ain't getting on no fast plane, hell  i ain't getting on no stuffy train  sugar boats on the atlantic are fine  the sugar boats they're just fine  i'll stand on the deck so you can see  i'll stand on the deck so you can wave   bye, bye, bye bye  bye, bye, bye bye  bye, bye, bye bye   bye, bye, bye bye   bye, bye, bye bye   bye, bye   here's the ghost that goes and waves  bye, bye, bye bye  bye, bye, bye bye  bye, bye, bye bye  i'm the ghost that goes and waves bye bye""  He is done with life and doesn't want to get therapy or make himself better anymore by getting on a ""fast plane"" or a ""stuffy train""; suicide (sugar boats) will do just fine. His standing on the deck so they can see is him making sure all people (or even the entire world) that wronged him makes sure they see what they did to him. He waves bye to life, and becomes a ghost who is manically waving bye at the life he was handed (which to me makes the byes even more creepy now that i think of it, and it sends chills down my spine when Isaac belts ""I'M THE GHOST THAT GOES AND WAVES BYE"")."

ModestMouse,35fvlm,brtt150,20,Sat May 9 23:22:31 2015 UTC,"Went to a modest louse concert two years ago on SF. All I remember is smoking pot and singing. They didn't play as many of their older songs as I would've liked but it was still an awesome performance and I really enjoyed it.   Modest Mouse got me thru a lot of hard times in college. I don't listen to them as much now and wouldn't recognize songs from their newest album... But they will always have a special place in my heart because I felt very connected to their music and lyrics.   One of my favorite songs is ""Heart Cooks Brain""... Think I'll have a listen to it now."
ModestMouse,35fvlm,gretay,7,Sat May 9 23:45:51 2015 UTC,You should listen to God Is An Indian and You're an Asshole. It's off the new album and really reminds me of their Lonesome Crowded West sound.

ModestMouse,35fvlm,Frimsah,2,Sun May 10 21:53:00 2015 UTC,"They come to Florida pretty regularly, and play in 3-4 cities while they're here.  I've caught them in Orlando in 2008 (Hard Rock), 2009 (House of Blues), and last year at The Beacham.  You'll probably get to see them.  Provided you buy tickets before they inevitably sell out in a few hours."
ModestMouse,35fvlm,tynamite,1 point,Mon May 11 22:09:53 2015 UTC,Nice. I'll be more prepared for their next show in Florida. I completely missed last year by a long shot. I forgot about the show when I happened to be in Orlando and saw everyone lined up.   Just hope the next one won't be a festival; only reason I didn't go to the Tampa show.

I was making a CD with Ugly Casanova, and I saw I had some space left and stuck it on there.  Great ending.  Play it on a lot of road trips.  Isaac fucks up the verse, but it just doesn't matter.  He moves into Rat seamlessly, and his passion and his scatting are just amazing."
ModestMouse,35cmzu,OneWonderfulFish,2,Sun May 10 18:39:55 2015 UTC,This kind of makes me wish they recorded We Were Dead with the same sort of production as their first few albums. The lo-fi quality adds a lot IMO.

ModestMouse,35ab7k,Right_All_The_Time,1 point,Fri May 8 19:59:36 2015 UTC,I think people who say they don't like the album for the less than half dozen times the lyrics are censored are letting that overshadow a totally interesting and unique cover album.
ModestMouse,35ab7k,Acetius,2,Fri May 8 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"Didn't say I didn't like it, I even said that it was interesting. My complaint's more about their needless censoring implying that a benign lyric is obscene. It makes it look like they only took a cursory glance at the lyrics before deciding to throw out the original and substitute it with something half-baked and ""more tasteful""."
ModestMouse,35ab7k,elkvision,1 point,Fri May 8 19:39:14 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call it unique exactly since these guys pump out cover albums on a kid's bop basis. Some good cuts though but the morality inserted is a little distracting cause I lose myself in the song while trying to see it from the perspective of a person that thinks the word naked is obscene. That sort of attitude towards Isaac's lyrics makes it feel more like a money grab than an artistic endeavor for me.
ModestMouse,35ab7k,joshjcummings,1 point,Fri May 8 22:37:37 2015 UTC,I think it would be more important to listen to this from the perspective  of a fan of Bluegrass rather than a fan of Modest Mouse.  The chaste/religious underpinnings of Bluegrass music demand that they perhaps error on the side of caution.
ModestMouse,35ab7k,elkvision,1 point,Fri May 8 23:44:27 2015 UTC,"Good point and I had considered that...a holes and f bombs would sound totally out of place on a bluegrass album, might as well be a gin and juice ironic hipster cover..but some of the censoring I do find annoying."
ModestMouse,35ab7k,Right_All_The_Time,1 point,Sat May 9 07:47:28 2015 UTC,"No I think there is an obvious fondness for Modest Mouse's music. There any number of bigger bands they could make a cover album of, they would be more profitable. I don't think there is a HUGE element of censorship, they are a bluegrass band and they just don't want to sing the works fuck or shit or screw. Not a big issue to me."
ModestMouse,35ab7k,elkvision,1 point,Sat May 9 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"Any number of bands is right, and they certainly have tried...you realize they have well over 200 complete cover albums of different bands in this ""pickin on"" series? MM is just one of many they've cashed in on.  I do enjoy much of it though and my gf loves it...maybe too much for my liking, she'd probably rather hear this than my nonstop MM playing  ;) but lets not pretend this was some special tribute from a little old bluegrass band."
ModestMouse,35ab7k,qui_tam_gogh,3,Sat May 9 07:43:30 2015 UTC,"Personally I think this is decent, nothing life changing. My personal favorite is Dark Center of the Universe. For some reason that one sounds most believable as an actual blue grass song."
ModestMouse,359lxp,divingstation,18,Fri May 8 06:49:35 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you, and this may be an unpopular opinion but it's my favorite album of theirs. People as Places I'd my all time favorite song and Spitting Venom is absolutely amazing. So many other great tracks like Parting of the Sensory and Little Motel."
ModestMouse,359lxp,gabeohrilla,6,Fri May 8 13:16:02 2015 UTC,People as Places is one of Issac's best vocal performances in my opinion. Just the way his voice sounds like it truly yearns for the past people and places of the past is very incredible.
ModestMouse,359lxp,0ffGrid,3,Fri May 8 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"When his voice breaks during the line ""the people you loved but you didn't quite know,"" my heart follows suit."

ModestMouse,359lxp,Bill__Buttlicker,12,Sat May 9 00:55:25 2015 UTC,"Most of us over probably exaggerate how much we don't care for We Were Dead. It's still a solid album that I personally enjoy the fuck out of hearing. It's just when you compare it to Lonesome Crowded West or The Moon and Antarctica, it's just not as great in most of our opinions.   Then again everything is subject to personal tastes so if you enjoy it, keep enjoying it."
ModestMouse,359lxp,ConnorCG,4,Fri May 8 13:31:21 2015 UTC,"So I've been listening to Modest Mouse for a few years now, and I keep making an effort to get into their older stuff but it just never sticks. I think it has to do with production value more than anything, but I really wish I could get past it. The rambling and messiness and just sort of ""There's too much lo-fi sound going on"" feeling always ruins my ability to enjoy the music.  Is it something that you are ever able to get past? I don't want to give up on their earlier stuff because it's all anyone here talks about, but I really just can't see myself liking it."
ModestMouse,359lxp,Bill__Buttlicker,8,Fri May 8 18:31:41 2015 UTC,"What I'm getting ready to say is borderline blasphemous on a Modest Mouse subreddit: I hated Lonesome Crowded West at first for the same reasons you said. I couldn't figure out why everyone loved it so much, then I listened to it during a random road trip and it clicked. It's now a top album for me. It also helps to read along with the lyrics. Isaac is a goddamn master at writing and that can be washed out occasionally by not being able to completely understand him."
ModestMouse,359lxp,Anti-Bullshit_Machin,1 point,Fri May 8 18:40:54 2015 UTC,"Can I ask what you mean by lo-fi sound? It's just cause i hear people using that to describe the early albums but honestly bands like Sparklehorse and Neutral Milk Hotel are blatantly lo-fi with absolute shit production value, despite the amazing material, and there's no semblance of anything similar in Long Drive and LCW. The vocals are as clear as they need to be, the guitars, drums, bass, all of it is clear as daylight. So what's lo-fi about it?"
ModestMouse,359lxp,alltomata,2,Sun May 10 17:06:00 2015 UTC,"Those early MM albums are lo-fi as fuck. A lot of them were recorded in one take, with equipment that was not top of the line at the time. Very little production done on them overall, it's just the instruments how they sounded when it was recorded. This is mentioned in the pitchfork documentary, a fragment of some audio clip plays towards the end of Truckers Atlas and was ultimately left it because ""fuck it, why not?"""
ModestMouse,359lxp,ConnorCG,2,Mon May 11 01:45:00 2015 UTC,"Drums aren't big, guitars sound like they're recorded in a bedroom, Isaac sounds kinda far away. It's not like they sound terrible, but it's not high production value"
ModestMouse,359lxp,gtnover,1 point,Mon May 11 14:06:11 2015 UTC,Can confirm that it just clicks one day. For me it was driving from Michigan to Canada for lonesome crowded west. And then recently driving from Michigan to Colorado for long drive with nothing to think about.
ModestMouse,359lxp,MsMagee,6,Mon May 11 15:33:01 2015 UTC,"I think nearly all of Modest Mouse's album are initially underrated by critics, often even by fans.  And then they become classics."
ModestMouse,359lxp,NEOOMGGeeWhiz,6,Fri May 8 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of angst towards that album in this sub, which I don't understand. There are a lot of solid songs on it, and like you it was the first of their albums that I listened to so maybe that's why I'm biased. Florida is a great song, so is dashboard. Marr brought something to the table that I appreciate.  But I feel the same about Good News, it's got a lot of strong tracks on it and doesn't deserve the hate it gets.   MM is easily my favorite band. Don't get me wrong, LCW, M&A, and long drive, etc. are all awesome. I enjoy all their albums, but I'm not going to apologize for the fact that ""Little Motel"" is the song that got me hooked on the band.   Right now though, I'm listening to LCW on repeat. Such a good album.  Edit: but I also think this highlights something about Modest Mouse that we can all agree on. They can be appreciated in such different ways. It's always so awesome to see people's different opinions on the albums. And honestly, each one is so distinct that it's not that surprising. I for one think that they are all good in their own ways, but of course I have my favorites."
ModestMouse,359lxp,Shizzable,3,Fri May 8 20:36:41 2015 UTC,"We Were Dead is my personal favorite Modest Mouse album at the moment, and I honestly think it rivals LCW and M&A (controversial opinion, as most people seem to really favor their older stuff significantly). Songs like Fire It Up, Parting Of The Sensory, and of course Spitting Venom are completely phenomenal and have a ton of depth musically and lyrically. I absolutely love a majority of the songs on there, in fact when I was typing the brief list above I tried to include all of the songs I think are stand-out but I ended up just listing most of the album."
ModestMouse,359lxp,gtnover,1 point,Sun May 10 02:15:17 2015 UTC,"Little motel, people as places as people, and missed the boat are amazing songs too. No fillers In the album.

Yeah, this is one of their best albums by far. Some awesome experimentation and a lot of bizarre off-kilter tracks. Fly Trapped in a Jar has some of their best guitar work ever, same with Little Motel. In my opinion Fire It Up and Education bring it down like a half a notch, but that's why I got rid of them and replaced them with King Rat and Whale Song (King Rat after We've Got Everything and Whale Song after Fly Trapped in a Jar). Honestly, adding those two songs turns this album into the perfect ""drunken sailor's madness"" album."
ModestMouse,359lxp,chedderbom,1 point,Sat May 9 18:12:41 2015 UTC,"I love ""Education"" dearly, but if you replaced it with the absolutely magnificent ""King Rat""... I suppose I can understand!"

ModestMouse,359lxp,NEOOMGGeeWhiz,1 point,Sun May 10 20:55:36 2015 UTC,"Disagree. I'd say We Were Dead is correctly rated. It's not terrible, it's not amazing. It's just, at times, unmemorable. While Spitting Venom and stuff might be great if you go to a MM show a lot of people aren't exactly hoping for like Fire It Up over any number of much better tunes. For any other band We Were Dead would be a very solid album but Modest Mouse set the bar so high that it was disappointing."
ModestMouse,359lxp,NGMCR,3,Fri May 8 16:57:33 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that ""Fire It Up"" is a pretty middle-of-the-road track. But on the other hand you have ""Dashboard,"" ""People as Places as People,"" ""Education,"" ""Parting of the Sensory,"" ""March into the Sea,"" etc. ""Missed the Boat"" and ""We've Got Everything"" feel more like Shins songs than Modest Mouse songs, honestly, but they're pretty damn good Shins songs. It is an uneven album, but for me the highs make up for the lows."
ModestMouse,359lxp,gtnover,4,Fri May 8 18:16:00 2015 UTC,Parking of the sensory is a fucking great song.
ModestMouse,359lxp,dr__worm,3,Fri May 8 20:37:59 2015 UTC,"This is exactly correct. For any other band, WWD would be top-tier stuff. But for Modest Mouse, when you look at what they've done in the past and even looking at STO, its just a sub par effort."
ModestMouse,359lxp,SamGamesPro,1 point,Fri May 8 17:52:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah the worst song is fire it up. It's way better than wild pack of family dogs and as good as convenient parking or Jesus Christ was an only child though.  Marched into the sea, missed the boat, Spitting Venom, people as places as people, little motel, are all top tier unforgettable modest mouse songs. I would rank these very closely with the top 5 of any other album.  The difference in my opinion is there are no filler songs. Fire it up is still a good song but because it's not a filler song, and not a top tier song it gets frowned on. While God is an Indian and wild pack of family dogs just don't count because they are fillers."
ModestMouse,359lxp,gtnover,1 point,Mon May 11 15:54:26 2015 UTC,"i honestly hate how modest mouse fans underrate these great albums. March into the sea, dashboard, fire it up, florida, missed the boat, weve got everything, little motel, and spitting venom are incredible tracks and even the ones that arent my favorite are still very good.

I also don't see the reason to get a tattoo that will most likely be on you for the rest of your life and have no meaning to it, maybe you could explain?"

ModestMouse,356290,MsMagee,2,Thu May 7 18:53:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, my first go around of the album I spotted it. It kinda makes me wonder if the Of course we know is saying ""Now we know that it was the last time we saw them"" more of an after the fact statement."
ModestMouse,356290,Dandroid,4,Thu May 7 17:44:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I kinda viewed Ansel as Isaac trying to convince himself that he was justified in missing the death of his brother, with the constant ""how could you know?"", as if to say ""Can you blame me? There was no way to know"". But then with Of Course We Know, he is realistically coming to terms with the fact that he didn't say goodbye to his brother and it's his own fault. No amount of repetitive phrases can take away the fact that he isn't content with how his final interactions with his brother went. Plus it being the last song on the album serves as a definitive statement."

The way I see it, long drive is just about how life is just a repetitive, absurd task .  All you can really do, at the end of the day, is take dramamine (or whatever your drug of choice is) and try (and fail) to make everyone happy.  In this sense, we are strangers to ourselves (because we like to think of ourselves as logical creatures): we know life is absurd, but we just don't really give a shit and choose to enjoy it anyway. This is both a good and bad thing. Isaac talks about negatives more, like the environmental impacts and stuff.  But it doesn't really matter if what we do makes no sense at all, (like kissing on the mouth but still coughing down our sleeves, killing a tortoise that offered to tell us the mysteries of the universe, or destroying the planet that we live on) because it's just human nature. Of course we know we're all just strangers to ourselves, but not everyone breaks down and has an existential crisis over it."

Best present ever.   They're still some left I believe  http://hollywoodforever.ticketfly.com/event/849297-modest-mouse-los-angeles  P.S. Never been at this venue, anyone have some advice? Edit: Now SOLD OUT"
ModestMouse,356sv6,catlady_man,1 point,Fri May 8 19:27:57 2015 UTC,"No advice. It's kind of a first come, the closer you get kind of thing. Very small intimate venue, it's going to be magical."
ModestMouse,356sv6,mikeoley,1 point,Sat May 9 00:51:18 2015 UTC,"I got in the virtual line at noon my time today when they opened. It told me there werent enough tickets to fill my order (3 total, 2 friends and myself). I had to consistently refresh. I kept seeing there were none available, and when they were, there was never enough. After like 20 minutes of refreshing and trying I was finally able to score all 3. Now my friends owe me 100 bucks.  Did not expect this to sell out so fast. Is that absolutely it or are they selling more down the line?"
ModestMouse,356sv6,rszdemon,1 point,Sat May 9 00:56:48 2015 UTC,"Late to the party, but I got my single ticket! Can't wait to see them! First time since 2013 and third overall. See you there!"
ModestMouse,356qk4,cheaha,6,Thu May 7 15:52:36 2015 UTC,I'm predicting Strangers to Ourselves with some sort of brown or white vinyl
ModestMouse,356qk4,CanoeShoes,4,Fri May 8 05:13:49 2015 UTC,everywhere and his nasty parlor tricks?  plz?
ModestMouse,356qk4,TheAllStarrBand,4,Thu May 7 16:40:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely not, that would be in the hands of GP and Fat Possum. Newbury does represses of albums that are usually readily avaliable. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that it's BNOOS and I8. They did pressings for LCW and Long Drive when they were released so this is probably going to be colored versions of the new ones."
ModestMouse,356qk4,shoulderdeep,2,Thu May 7 17:45:29 2015 UTC,Possibly but that would surprise me since they were just reissued on colored vinyl within the last month.
ModestMouse,356qk4,mrfoeman,2,Thu May 7 18:15:49 2015 UTC,after the I8 and BNOOS represses were announced i emailed newbury and they said they had no intentions to repress those on colored vinyl. so i would be surprised if they changed their minds that fast
ModestMouse,356qk4,shoulderdeep,1 point,Thu May 7 19:35:43 2015 UTC,I8 is on blue vinyl in the UK.
ModestMouse,356qk4,unplacid,1 point,Sun May 10 14:26:26 2015 UTC,I know. Since them Newbury sent a email saying new Modest Mouse stuff is coming out.
ModestMouse,356qk4,raining_picnic,3,Sun May 10 14:39:50 2015 UTC,Here's hoping for Moon and Antarctica with 2004 cover art on light blue vinyl.
ModestMouse,353kru,Tentaclarm,19,Wed May 6 20:34:17 2015 UTC,Hi.

ModestMouse,353kru,unrelentingdepth,12,Wed May 6 23:15:32 2015 UTC,This post is definitely crashing!
ModestMouse,359g85,Hearbinger,7,Fri May 8 05:32:54 2015 UTC,GO TO A SHOW!! Then you might have more traction in commenting on a bands live performance.  BTW a shitty youtube video never translates well to anything  watch this in the meantime https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5l13fTcvlI
ModestMouse,359g85,lilsamg,8,Fri May 8 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"What? If anything Isaac overdoes it (in a good way) and gets so into it. Seriously, just listen to ANY recording of Sugar Boats, King Rat, Tiny Cities Made of Ashes, or Teeth Like God's Shoeshine and you'll see what I mean. To be fair, he was sometimes out of it in early shows (probably due to him be drunk, or high, or both) but he's usually a very energetic performer."
ModestMouse,359g85,Buffarrow,-5,Fri May 8 06:31:00 2015 UTC,"There are sporadic recordings that are nice, like I said. But in general, I think he lacks energy or effort. Look at this version of Missed The Boat, for example. Even a soft song like this is badly sang, his voice tone varies a lot through the song, he doesn't put energy into it, sometimes you can't even hear it properly. While it's still enjoyable, I think he could do much better with a little more effort."
ModestMouse,359g85,SamGamesPro,7,Fri May 8 06:37:30 2015 UTC,"I always felt like judging by youtube videos many modest mouse shows could be either a hit or miss, and often a miss, but i just saw them a few weeks ago and isaac was on fire the whole time, it was great."
ModestMouse,359g85,SamGamesPro,-5,Fri May 8 07:32:08 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I'd surely see them live if I had the opportunity, and I'm sure I would enjoy it immensely. But the fact is, I think he could do much better if he worked a little more on his singing, because he shows, in some performances, that he has the capability to do so, unlike some artists that sound differently live because of heavy editing on studio records."
ModestMouse,359g85,SamGamesPro,3,Fri May 8 13:49:26 2015 UTC,"If you'd notice, their playing to an Asian crowd. This likely means they are touring in Japan or basically in a timezone that is 13 hours ahead of what he's used to. Japan and overseas countries are normally at the end of the tour so he's been touring most of that year and these were probably some of his last shows. You never know what he's gone through in the last week in between each show."
ModestMouse,359g85,theredball,-3,Fri May 8 15:33:11 2015 UTC,"This is video I posted just one example, not the only one. Besides, he seems pretty energic, physically speaking. People here are always mentioning things like tiredness, but that doesn't convince me. He does that in a lot of performances, if he is always playing tired, he is just as guilty, that's his profession, after all."
ModestMouse,359g85,theredball,2,Fri May 8 16:10:40 2015 UTC,"So you're saying if you were 34, had been touring and making albums a majority of your life, you would still be at the top of your game every time you perform? I find that hard to believe. He's had lots of problems with drug addiction and even used to cut himself on stage. He was accused with rape and has stated that people would look at him with disgust every time he walked into a room. I'm not excusing him for being off on some nights, but I don't think it's right to say he doesn't try to sing."
ModestMouse,359g85,MsMagee,-1,Fri May 8 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert in music, specially in singing. When I say that it seems like isn't putting effort into singing is the way I have to describe what I hear. I'm not condemning him or anything, I'm just trying to express what I'm hearing."
ModestMouse,359g85,Right_All_The_Time,2,Fri May 8 19:28:59 2015 UTC,"It's obvious to everyone he isn't singing it like in the record, but it's extremely different from stage or microphone or cable setups then in a studio. You have to take in that, sleepiness, drugs, drama, everything else as well."
ModestMouse,359g85,MsMagee,1 point,Fri May 8 22:20:51 2015 UTC,"Well, singing is his profession, he should try not to exercise it while drunk, drugged or tired. It's a disrespect to those that payed to be there. That falls into the ""put more effort"" category I mentioned."
ModestMouse,359g85,radioshackhead,6,Sat May 9 15:34:37 2015 UTC,I mean he's dripping in sweat and playing a fairly slow song. Looks like they're playing that song basically to chill out.   He's fucking nuts on stage generally when i've seen him live. He just looks fucking exhausted on that performance of missed the boat
ModestMouse,359g85,failbruiser,-4,Fri May 8 12:05:30 2015 UTC,"I'm talking specifically about his singing, his voice. He doesn't put the same emotion or effort that we can hear in the studio version on some specific live perfornances. The end of some sentences is almost inaudible, for example. He seems to be singing like ""whatever, i'll just mumble the lyrics here to the melody"". Sometimes he employs good vocal power, sings a couple of verses nicely, and then goes back. Do you get what I'm saying? It's not about his stage energy, it's specifically about his voice and singing. Since I don't know much about technical features of singing, I'm trying to explain what I notice."
ModestMouse,359g85,Right_All_The_Time,5,Fri May 8 13:44:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I get what you're saying. I just think the lack of enthusiasm in the singing has to do with how tired he looks there.
ModestMouse,359g85,failbruiser,1 point,Fri May 8 14:05:21 2015 UTC,"It is a good hypothesis. At least you acknowledged it was there, which many people here couldn't. One thing that bugs me and I've been trying to point here is how he doesn't sing well or sustains the end of some verses: Notice, for example, around 0:55 into the song. The verse ""Oh, please, just last"" You can't even hear the ""last"". In 2:10, he sings ""Build that good goddamn"", and you barely hear goddamn."
ModestMouse,359g85,failbruiser,4,Sat May 9 15:40:24 2015 UTC,Please do your homework [go see a show and report back]. This is like judging a country by a postcard.
ModestMouse,359g85,Right_All_The_Time,-2,Fri May 8 16:36:58 2015 UTC,"Contact Isaac Brock and make him come to Brazil, then I'll go.  I was sure the discussion would get to this point. I explained, it's not about the energy of the show, or the band's stage presence. It's about his voice, his singing, which a video captures perfectly. My point stands."
ModestMouse,359g85,Right_All_The_Time,3,Fri May 8 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"You are more than welcome to your opinion, it doesn't make it the right opinion. It's unfortunate you live in a place a lot of bands do not tour in, but the tiny sample size of poor quality, poorly recorded and mixed and mic'd clips you are judging solely on isn't a good way to judge a band and a vocalist."
ModestMouse,359g85,StockmanBaxter,-3,Fri May 8 17:07:00 2015 UTC,"I see we won't achieve anything with this. I watched several clips of them playing live on YouTube, and the vast majority is not ""poor quality"". While some are good, many of them disappointed me specially concerning to Isaac Brock's vocals, which, like I said, are captured perfectly by videos. You disagree, that's alright."
ModestMouse,359g85,brtt150,3,Fri May 8 17:20:25 2015 UTC,"""I drew a blank""  Seriously. I like this reddit site because we discuss and sometimes agree to disagree without getting ugly or personal.  This is one of those times.   I hope they come to Brazil so you can see the real deal.  They were supposed to play in Rio a few years ago.  The band got there only to find that the Airline had failed to load any of their gear.  It all sat in on a tarmac in Dallas.  edited to correct auto correct!"
ModestMouse,359g85,brtt150,4,Fri May 8 20:26:30 2015 UTC,Are you talking about actually being there live or watching videos of live shows?
ModestMouse,359g85,rszdemon,-6,Fri May 8 15:29:06 2015 UTC,"I have never seem them live, but I'm talking about his voice specifically, not about the show's energy or anything."
ModestMouse,359g85,rszdemon,7,Fri May 8 16:11:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should be making judgments about the live performances of a ban you've never seen live. I've seen them numerous time and I've always thought he put in a lot of effort.  Edit: As a side note, I don't usually enjoy recording of any band's live performances. There's some Daft Punk and Modest mouse stuff that I only have live version of and I love them though. Do yourself a favor and see them when you get a chance. It's a totally different thing."
ModestMouse,359g85,SamGamesPro,-5,Fri May 8 16:41:06 2015 UTC,"You don't think a video capture his voice/singing with fidelity? Because I think it does. Evidently, the heat of the show has its influence towards the public. When I was listening to a recording of a show I went to, I noticed much more flaws that I had completely missed while I was there. You analyse it more coldly at home"
ModestMouse,359g85,SamGamesPro,2,Fri May 8 16:44:55 2015 UTC,"These shitty youtube videos are not an accurate representation, nor are TV spots that are mic'd and mixed poorly. You cannot make a technical assessment on a band's live prowess without actually seeing the live in front of you. Music is meant to be seen and heard in person not on YouTube."
ModestMouse,359g85,SamGamesPro,-1,Fri May 8 17:05:15 2015 UTC,"They aren't shitty, they're good quality. Yes, it's another experience to see it live, but it doesn't change the fact that a video captures the song accurately, it's a good source to judge."

ModestMouse,353oiw,Zack_of_Steel,1 point,Thu May 7 00:56:26 2015 UTC,"My guess is they've already booked to play Riot Fest and that's why nothing has been announced yet since they haven't posted the line up.   It's August 28th - 30th, they have nothing else listed for any of those dates, and with the ""Rodeo / Cowboy"" theme of the show this year they wouldn't be wildly out of place, not that it matters because Devotchka played Riot Fest one year as well."

ModestMouse,34yq9r,skyraiderofreddit,4,Tue May 5 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"Seems like Isaac doesn't like playing at festivals too much. I saw them at Hangout. He didn't say a word to the crowd. Like, not anything. Which is weird because he's typically pretty interactive. But he didn't say hi, bye, how you doing, nothing. Music was still good, just seemed like he didn't enjoy it."
ModestMouse,34yq9r,NEOOMGGeeWhiz,4,Tue May 5 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"I can relate to that, I can't stand festivals either. I would much rather see a smaller and more intimate show."

ModestMouse,34yq9r,go-cartMozart,4,Tue May 5 21:44:00 2015 UTC,yes there were some rude immature people there.  Modest Mouse is coming to my city for a smaller music festival in July so I'm gonna go there and see them.  I'm going to Shaky Knees this weekend :)
ModestMouse,34yq9r,cheaha,1 point,Tue May 5 22:03:52 2015 UTC,I'm going to SlossFest too. Hopefully the crowd will be chill.
ModestMouse,34yq9r,Fuzzy_Socrates,4,Thu May 7 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"I've seen them at plenty of festivals, but hangout was their worst show. The sound was terribly mixed and even after the first song I saw isaac point to his microphone, then to a his monitor, look extremely angry, and yell ""Fuck It"" (I was up front just for their set).  Hangout is a bad example for them at festivals. The headlined The Shaky Knees festival and played a vast majority of classics, and an epic 14 minute Whale Song. They were in Firefly three years ago, and they had a folktastic set, which progressively became more new. It depends upon the crowd, and the venue's ability to mix IMO."
ModestMouse,34yq9r,MsMagee,1 point,Wed May 6 00:14:16 2015 UTC,"And I think depending on the festival they are can be more limited on how much is time allowed for each band, so rather than spending time chit chatting [always a fun time] they just get down to business and try to get as many tunes played as they can.  edited because sometimes I can be dumber than I want to share with the world!  Half finished thought and hanging sentences etc."
ModestMouse,34yq9r,GravityRides,3,Wed May 6 02:07:43 2015 UTC,"Isaac is not a fan of festivals, espeically SXSW. When I met him last year some girl said to him ""I remember seeing you at SXSW years ago!"" and Isaac responded in a sarcastic/jokingly manner ""And we're never going to play it again!"" I skipped seeing them at a Radio Festival recently too and they were only limited to like 10 songs? Not worth it IMO, if you have to wait all day and hear other bands you don't like that are overplayed on the radio all day."
ModestMouse,34yq9r,spork_br,4,Wed May 6 05:44:13 2015 UTC,I look forward to watching them at ACL via YouTube :)
ModestMouse,34yq9r,lebeaura,3,Tue May 5 22:08:31 2015 UTC,Is that comparable to Travis County Limits?

The sound needs fixing, he complains about how hot it is, he lectures the crowd.. He loses his pick and dives under the stage to retrieve it. He has to duct tape his guitar strap on. Good stuff.

ModestMouse,34we22,asmart,3,Tue May 5 02:49:58 2015 UTC,Isaac screaming into that megaphone and swapping to the regular stage mic in Ice on the Sheets is the best thing I've seen in ages. Thanks for posting this!!

ModestMouse,34w1tv,divingstation,9,Fri May 8 04:22:27 2015 UTC,"I really love the ethereal sounding voices that start up near the end of the song, particularly Lisa's. She reminds me a lot of the female voice in Long Distance Drunk, that I adore so much. That kind of sound goes so well as a complement to Isaac's."
ModestMouse,34w1tv,Brutusness,9,Tue May 5 01:41:11 2015 UTC,One of the best lines on the album   The way we feel about what we do is by who has watched us

ModestMouse,34w1tv,beard_lover,3,Tue May 5 05:31:14 2015 UTC,I prefer the sound of this version that Isaac played in this video.

ModestMouse,34w1tv,dpog,-2,Sun May 10 16:34:43 2015 UTC,"I don't take away anything from it, or really any track on the new album. The whole album feels like Brock trying to make puns into something meaningful, and it just falters from the start.  Here's a youtube comment I saw.   Favorite off the new album. Damn near perfect. It just summarizes life perfectly in about 4 minutes. More or less, we stay the same throughout life. We have a pretty good idea about the difference between right and wrong. We judge ourselves based on input from others. We change a little over time, but since we're in the thick of it, we don't necessarily see it... so much to unpack here.   Except, there's nothing else to unpack. Humans are terrible. That's it. The entire album is ""Man is bad, and ruining everything."" It's like the Disney movie Bambi packed into an album, but you can only say ""Man is in the forest"" so many times within an album until it starts to run thin.  Don't get me wrong, I've been a huge MM fan since I bought M&A when it dropped, but ultimately this album has been a disappointment and I don't find myself coming back to it at all since release."
ModestMouse,34w1tv,im_the_fart_man,1 point,Fri May 8 00:48:16 2015 UTC,"It's funny you say this, because one of my favorite things about the new album is that Isaac seems like he's finally getting away from writing lyrics that mostly consist of random puns and ironic phrases. To me it sounds like he's writing music with real meaning again."
ModestMouse,34w1tv,BickNaymond,1 point,Sat May 9 17:26:01 2015 UTC,"As opposed to what exactly? Wordplay was always his writing style and it's present on this album, however, it all reinforces the same (tired) theme, which is my complaint."
ModestMouse,34vbcq,0ffGrid,11,Mon May 4 21:25:54 2015 UTC,Yep. Tremendously underrated just like everything on that album except for the whale song.
ModestMouse,34vbcq,wormyrocks,5,Tue May 5 02:29:05 2015 UTC,Can't tell if you're saying whale song sucks or that it's great and it gets the credit it damn well deserves.
ModestMouse,34vbcq,MisterPee,9,Tue May 5 03:28:19 2015 UTC,The second one
ModestMouse,34vbcq,wormyrocks,3,Tue May 5 06:31:34 2015 UTC,Good. Whale song is beautiful.
ModestMouse,34vbcq,MisterPee,14,Tue May 5 13:29:49 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite songs of theirs period - the only one I consistently listen to off of 'no one's first' album. Short song, quick witty turns of phrase - rather like beauty in dirt.  My favorite like is ""exchanging comfort for more fashionable clothes"". It's just kind of a rat-a-tat of cool lyrics and then it gets a little heavier, the same progression as spitting venom. Which is kinda cool."
ModestMouse,34vbcq,wobowobo,5,Mon May 4 21:38:18 2015 UTC,"one of my all time favorites. there's a video on YouTube where they play live in front of a festival flawlessly.  favorite part has to be the second half, right after ""yes everything just might fly by, no one is getting blamed this time""  beautiful fuckin song."
ModestMouse,34vbcq,ratonMODESTO,5,Mon May 4 22:52:01 2015 UTC,"""I drew a blank, we put it in a frame.""  I think its my 3rd favorite song on the ep behind only The Whale Song and Ive got it all(most). The whole ""hey there mister sweet and awful"" and ""tell your gods i wanna speak to their fathers"" is great."
ModestMouse,34vbcq,dylonpollak,4,Tue May 5 20:03:16 2015 UTC,"I love this song.  Every part of it.  ""Did you buy that face? No it's just a mask _so Happy Halloween!"" How can he push all of those words out of his mouth so fast? Interestingly it was from the time of the Financial collapse in 07-08 and I've always gotten a strong sense that it had to do with all of the blame game going on in the nation over who was to blame. As well a refection on how materialistic and mundane our society has become. I really like a lot of the songs from No One's First."
ModestMouse,34vbcq,MsMagee,2,Wed May 6 00:49:31 2015 UTC,"I love it! I have a cocker spaniel from the shelter, so I can relate :D"
ModestMouse,34vbcq,tinylaugh,2,Tue May 5 02:42:11 2015 UTC,It's really the only song I listen to off that EP
ModestMouse,34vbcq,0piat3,1 point,Tue May 5 07:37:02 2015 UTC,"Oh my God, where do I start...?  First off — The guitar. It starts off so soothing, simple, and playful, and it just gets more and more energetic, like a dog. And then, after a period of calm, it just starts... I don't know how to describe it, it just starts rolling in some majestic way. Then it gets tranquil, not in the way it was in the beginning, but it all pleasantly slows down. Then, it rockets back off, before descending to the original opening.   Brock's singing in this is phenomenal. Not in the traditional sense, but it works really freaking well for this song. He sounds like he's aimlessly ranting, but in some freakishly coherent way that it keeps in line with the peppery guitar, and the way he just sounds like he's breaking everything down with his shouting at the end provides a satisfying finale.  TL;DR, dat rolling guitar"
ModestMouse,34xid9,JonnyTango,1 point,Tue May 5 11:31:06 2015 UTC,GOOD NEWS they just announced a lot of Europe shows. Check modestmouse.com
ModestMouse,34xid9,Right_All_The_Time,1 point,Thu May 7 15:40:18 2015 UTC,there are no new europe dates actually
ModestMouse,34xid9,sadcomedian,1 point,Thu May 7 16:40:21 2015 UTC,"Ahh I saw 13 Europe/UK dates in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Germany, Poland, Netherlands, England, Ireland, thought they were new.  Keep in mind that Modest Mouse isn't as popular in the UK/Europe as they are in North America.  So maybe only 13 dates there for now isn't THAT surprising."
ModestMouse,34xid9,Right_All_The_Time,1 point,Thu May 7 16:43:22 2015 UTC,Yeah but two years ago they announced a shit ton of Shows for europe and then cancelled  them with the note that they would make up for it. Next year. That was i think two years ago and now they are playing 7 Shows on the european mainland and 7 in the fucking uk. Thats somewhat disappointing for me. :(
ModestMouse,34xid9,Right_All_The_Time,1 point,Thu May 7 20:54:24 2015 UTC,Is it just disappointing for you because of those 7 Europe shows isn't near where you live?
ModestMouse,34xid9,Right_All_The_Time,2,Fri May 8 02:23:18 2015 UTC,"Yes well last time they announced their shows it was directly in my city which is one of the biggest cities in Germany in one of the biggest metropole regions of the world. So its not like i live in the middle of nowhere and expect them to play in my city but it would be reasonable for them to play in my region. Last time the tickets here were selling quite well, they even had to change the gig into a bigger venue. I probably could go to the show in the Netherlands which is like a 2 1/2 hour drive (I know for most Americans this is basically next door) but still I just thought next time they would come to Europe they would announce a lot of shows like last time. Especially since the last time they played here is like over a decade ago."

I absolutely love it, I'll never skip it if it comes on.   As to the lyrics? The idea of a pack of feral dogs taking you up to heaven is a great mental image. Makes me think of the novel 'Rant' by Chuck Palahnuik and the packs of dogs that would terrorize the small trashy town Rant grew up in."
ModestMouse,34olfi,A_Mediocre_Time,7,Sun May 3 15:53:11 2015 UTC,"They played it live I think it was around when they took off in 2004. But he had said at the end of the song he mentioned it was ""A true story told by a liar."" It could have more meaning like you mentioned and it could just be a fun story he heard or came up with."
ModestMouse,34olfi,MsMagee,3,Sun May 3 17:15:34 2015 UTC,a [pretty] true story from Sunburst Montana
ModestMouse,34olfi,Getinthevandude,2,Sun May 3 22:27:04 2015 UTC,Minus the used condoms and feminine hygiene products?!
ModestMouse,34olfi,A_Mediocre_Time,2,Thu May 7 19:35:25 2015 UTC,"Haha exactly, minus the tumbleweeds of latex"
ModestMouse,34olfi,Getinthevandude,2,Thu May 7 19:48:21 2015 UTC,I'd like to know more about the Buster snake bite!

ModestMouse,34olfi,whofan012,4,Fri May 8 03:11:09 2015 UTC,"Gone from ""well that was weird"" on the first listen, to really looking forward to it on the album run-through. Probably the song that gets stuck in my head the most."
ModestMouse,34olfi,Colonel_Hapablap,3,Sun May 3 07:45:24 2015 UTC,"It's one heck of a come down from The Stars Are Projectors preceding it. The Stars Are Projectors is really intense, full on and philosophical, going over 8 minutes. Wild Pack of Family Dogs is mellow, relaxed and personal, not lasting 2 minutes."
ModestMouse,34olfi,TrumdiTehViking,2,Sun May 3 16:59:58 2015 UTC,"To me, the song is about how religious groups trend to destroy relationships outside of the church. I grew up in a protestant household in Idaho (the state with potatoes), but I always considered myself kind of agnostic. Recently, the Mormon community in my hometown converted my older sister to join, and my family life has been pretty shit since then. I guess you could say that the pack went and took my sister away. The song also has significant religious references because towards the end there is a line that says ""the dogs started floating towards the glowing sky"" or something closely related. I know Isaac had a pretty shitty relationship with religion because of how he was taught to speak in tongues and all, so this song is probably just ultimately about his disgust of organized religion. But I guess that's like my opinion, dude.  Also, look up Jesus Christ was an Only Child. That song has alot in common with this one."

ModestMouse,34olfi,jcsatan,1 point,Sun May 3 22:50:40 2015 UTC,Still one of the few MM songs I do not like. I will say the accordion towards the end helps it though.
ModestMouse,34olfi,bootthecat,1 point,Mon May 4 15:53:06 2015 UTC,"I never enjoyed it that much until hearing live versions. Don't think too hard, just enjoy the ride."
ModestMouse,34olfi,srdyuop,1 point,Mon May 4 19:15:41 2015 UTC,"I'm a few days late to this thread, but I just wanted to pitch in that I always thought this song was about being taken into custody by CPS. I have no idea if that was really the intention behind the song, however."
ModestMouse,34mzc1,NerfWrangler,7,Sat May 2 17:10:19 2015 UTC,Holy shit. Just experienced my first modest experience
ModestMouse,34mzc1,girlindie,2,Sat May 2 18:25:25 2015 UTC,And it was incredible.
ModestMouse,34mzc1,MsMagee,1 point,Sat May 2 20:37:31 2015 UTC,Sweet! Their concerts have been stellar this year.  Do you have a set list by any chance?
ModestMouse,34mzc1,danieldevill,1 point,Sat May 2 22:21:55 2015 UTC,Was also just there. I wish the audio on the vocals could have been louder though. I could hardly hear them sometimes.
ModestMouse,34mzc1,tissin,2,Sat May 2 22:27:08 2015 UTC,Care to share the setlist?

ModestMouse,34nleo,VoraciousViking,2,Sat May 2 20:23:50 2015 UTC,"That looks dope, man."
ModestMouse,34nleo,ben_jammin98,1 point,Sat May 2 21:49:15 2015 UTC,Thanks man
ModestMouse,34nleo,TrumdiTehViking,1 point,Sat May 2 22:32:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, you're the guy who started the ravens and seagulls discussion. I like you."
ModestMouse,34o0kb,ben_jammin98,9,Sat May 2 22:45:13 2015 UTC,"I can help with more bands: 764-HERO, Dinosaur Jr., The Shins, Sleater Kinney, The Sea and Cake and Heatmiser (Elliott Smith) are some to add to the list of bands who helped push the Northwest Sound.   The sound covers a lot. Mainly the Northwest Sound is a label put on all the indie bands that were based in the northwest. There are a lot of bands that share similarities in sound, but obviously each has a unique sound."
ModestMouse,34o0kb,Totnog,3,Sun May 3 01:21:57 2015 UTC,Death Cab for Cutie  I think ya dropped this
ModestMouse,34o0kb,TrumdiTehViking,1 point,Mon May 4 15:21:36 2015 UTC,Oh my :/ My sweet Ben Gibbard are you okay??
ModestMouse,34o0kb,Totnog,3,Mon May 4 23:54:13 2015 UTC,Shhh... Don't wake him up. He's sleeping in.
ModestMouse,34o0kb,TrumdiTehViking,4,Tue May 5 00:08:20 2015 UTC,Band of Horses and Sir Mix-a-lot.
ModestMouse,34o0kb,elkvision,3,Mon May 4 21:57:56 2015 UTC,"My friend's step dad actually knew Sir Mix-a-lot for a long time, but he only knew him by his first name. It wasn't until a few years after they had met that he found out his stage name."
ModestMouse,34o0kb,TrumdiTehViking,2,Tue May 5 00:07:00 2015 UTC,"I love me some Band of Horses, man."
ModestMouse,34o0kb,elkvision,2,Mon May 4 22:08:00 2015 UTC,Some indie-glam at it's finest. I love em too :)
ModestMouse,34o0kb,TrumdiTehViking,1 point,Tue May 5 02:06:15 2015 UTC,go down to   You from Canadia?
ModestMouse,34lole,Piecatcher,2,Sat May 2 07:02:09 2015 UTC,"Weird timing. I was looking at someone else's original music inspired by MM and it was OK and it reminded me of this that I""m pretty sure I saw on this sub... and I like it  http://pillfriends.bandcamp.com/  I like the song klonopin."
ModestMouse,34lole,ghost_victim,3,Sat May 2 09:53:55 2015 UTC,"I fucking love pillfriends. I recommend their album ""Blessed Suffering"" to any MM fan. The lead singer grew up obsessed with MM, and you can hear elements of it in their music.  They're like Conor Oberst+ Modest Mouse, but a bit noisier."
ModestMouse,34lole,deadkathy,3,Sat May 2 18:23:19 2015 UTC,"lol it rules that i keep seeing us get mentioned in this subreddit.  we literally are a band because of our mutual love for modest mouse.  i learned how to drum by listening to modest mouse. we used to cover trailer trash, sleepwalking and mice eat cheese live"
ModestMouse,34lole,lilbigmane,1 point,Wed May 6 21:14:54 2015 UTC,Whats up! I love your guys music. Please tell me there's a video of a Mice Eat Cheese cover you guys did.
ModestMouse,34lole,deadkathy,2,Wed May 6 21:59:07 2015 UTC,thanks<33  just an old shitty/shitty quality video of us doing sleepwalkin with sam ray https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01BYJMWHzR0
