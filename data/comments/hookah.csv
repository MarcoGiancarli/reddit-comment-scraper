hookah,3e5062,saharahookah,4,Wed Jul 22 00:24:07 2015 UTC,"I do not recommend popping a burn blister ever, it may be uncomfortable but I recently had an accident involving touching really hot metal and it's best to leave the blister alone and let it leak on its own and to never remove it, depends on how dirty it gets but it will hurt like hell and for longer if you decide to tear it off..."
hookah,3e5062,snakess2,2,Wed Jul 22 01:26:41 2015 UTC,"I actually experienced the opposite. Perhaps it changes depending on whether the burn was caused by a hot implement or by a hot liquid instead, but I spilled boiling water all over my hand, and half of it twisted up from the blisters. The first handful of blisters went away on their own, but the last few stuck around annoyingly long, so I popped them open and removed the skin flaps. They ended up healing practically by the next day, and they didn't hurt at all."
hookah,3e5062,Afrew,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:07:09 2015 UTC,"I guess it does, though from my experience it was simply extremely hot metal, there is not really any risk of infection or anything, I simply let it heal on its own, though the skin in the area is still a little rough, about 5 days later, but nothing hurts and no further blistering. I can only speak for ""Implement"" side of things, I have never really scolded myself with boiling water before, perhaps that's for the best as it doesn't sound particularly pleasant."
hookah,3e5062,snakess2,2,Wed Jul 22 03:15:40 2015 UTC,Usually it's more about infection risk u are usually okay to pop them if u wanna wash them constantly but it sounds like u shouldn't if it hurts worse hahahah
hookah,3e5062,SpookytheGhost,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:56:47 2015 UTC,"Washing the scolded area of skin with cold water seems to relieve it somewhat and stop it from swelling too bad, in my experience at least, if stuff has made it through the skin, then you are at risk of infection, other than that it's probably best to leave the blister alone afterwards until it goes away on its own, you're probably at a higher risk of infection if you pop or tear it straight away."
hookah,3e5062,snakess2,3,Wed Jul 22 03:18:08 2015 UTC,"Ouch, that looks like it hurt like hell. Not done that yet myself, but I have stepped on a rather large ember that I thought fizzled out."

I dunno, maybe it just isn't for everyone. I've only had tang once. It was horchata. Nothing I did worked. Packed in an alien, I tried 2 whole flats, 3 flat halves, 2 flat halves, 2 sheets of foil... Every time it just made you want to cough without ever getting much smoke. Honestly that flavor just kinda turned me off from Tang."
hookah,3e3hsq,steeltowndude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:49 2015 UTC,"its easy for people to say ""you packed it wrong"" you are right. thing with tangiers is all of the variables. you get one thing off by just ""so"" and your session can be ruined, its not very forgiving.   i can say that horchata is very heat sensitive, even in noir, more so in birquq but when you get it right, its pretty damn incredible."
hookah,3e3hsq,rosspod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:43 2015 UTC,"This made me stall on ordering horchata online because I heard how heat sensitive it can get. What is your advice for me if I were to get it in birquq, pack it in a phunnel and use a lotus? I have coco nara coals right now. Would you recommend 2 or 3 coals? The lotus top with the holes open, closed or should I just remove the top completely?  I found that letting the lotus heat cane mint birquq with the top off gets me an excellent taste!"
hookah,3e3hsq,thatsthejam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:17:36 2015 UTC,"I haven't really tried with my lotus and birquq. My advice would be to start with two and move up. you don't want to start with too much heat, you can scorch your bowl easily that way. Hopefully someone else who uses a lotus will chime in."
hookah,3e3hsq,rosspod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:27:08 2015 UTC,"Depends on the size of your bowl. In an 80ft i start with 2 titanium cubes (I guess 3 flats would be around the same) with the top off completely. It takes a little while to get going but it does not overheat. When I feel the smoke starting to whittle / want to test my luck I put on the lid with the vents open, and then finally I close the vent. The majority of the time I'm smoking, the top is completely off, and I often remove it after I had put it on if I feel it getting too harsh.  Important thing is to catch it early. I can never really smoke Tangiers when I'm sharing the pipe with a lot of friends. Someone will let it get way to hot and hand it back asking me to fix it, but at that point it's already ruined.  While Tangiers has provided me with some of the best smokes I've had, the amount of effort required is just too much for a nice relaxing smoke. I'm on the fence as to whether I'll be getting more in my next haul. When it smokes good, it really does turn out well. It's just achieving that consistently which is the problem."
hookah,3e3hsq,MrLeb,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:48:09 2015 UTC,I like going three flat cocos or two Prestiges with one on top until it fits in and the lid can go on.

hookah,3e3hsq,rosspod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:00 2015 UTC,"One other thing, to me there is a big big taste difference on the birquq version of oliloqui to the burley version. I kind of prefer the burley version and I get a sweeter taste out of the birquq.   Which line were you using?"
hookah,3e3hsq,spanky1337,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:30:06 2015 UTC,"I had similar experiences, but even once I got it right (I did, once or twice) all I could think was ""This wasn't worth it.""  Everyone will insist I did it wrong, or that i'm not a real fan of hookah, but I just don't find tangiers enjoyable enough to accept the fact that it takes me significantly longer to pack, and WAY longer to learn to pack it in the first place. That's just me though, I wouldn't say it's a bad tobacco, just that I think people hype it up a bit too much."
hookah,3e3hsq,figmaxwell,2,Wed Jul 22 00:57:23 2015 UTC,"I am not a tangiers person. I've tried a dozen or so flavor and have managed to get some pretty good sessions out of all of them. But there's a specific flavor that I can taste behind all of them that just doesn't do it for me. If it's not for you, then it's not for you. There's no need to push yourself to like it more because everyone else does. Different people have different tastes."
hookah,3e3hsq,AnxietyoO,3,Tue Jul 21 18:21:35 2015 UTC,"Ololiqui is a really bad one to throw the straw in on to be honest. It's a very very potent rootbeer flavor with some strong tobacco undertones. Have you tried Strawberry, Sourwatermelon, Pineapple, Kiwi strawberry, Kashmir peach, Kashmir cherry by any chance? These are just some flavors I'm throwing off the top of my head that have always been smooth crisp flavors.  Tangiers is not for every one, even if you're packing it perfectly it just may be a brand that you don't enjoy and there's nothing wrong with that. For me personally, it's always been a pleasure to smoke."

hookah,3e5g4c,tayllerr,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:35:09 2015 UTC,"(DISCLAIMER: I do not own a lounge or work at one; this is just what I've spoken to about/heard from lounge workers and owners.)  When it comes to picking your hookahs, Khalil Mamoon Cafe's are usually a good bet, paired up with Tonic 2.0 hoses which are actually a decent buy for the price; easily cleanable, too.  Because you'll more than likely be dealing with groups of people coming to smoke together, stocking up on Harmony bowls wouldn't be a bad idea; they hold a lot of shisha and are ideal for groups, and they fit nicely on KM stems.  If you don't plan on using quicklights, Hookahjohn sells Titanium lounge boxes; just make sure you've got a good gas stove running in the back. If you plan on using quicklights, Starbuzz now makes coconut instant lights that should work pretty well; just be sure to light them with a lighter and not on a stove.  (EDIT, because I left it out somehow) If you want to skip the whole heat-management thing with your lounge, then go ahead and get a Kaloud Lotus for every hookah. Typically, you can always lay one natural coal flat and a second stonehenged; your customers should be happy for an hour and a half or so."
hookah,3e5g4c,Gragorovich,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:56:48 2015 UTC,"It all depends what kind of lounge you want to open  Also more business would be in Houston than Galveston  You are probably looking at an easy 30-50k startup cost between hookahs, shisha, bowl, coals   Profit depends on the location and service   If you need help let me know and I can help out a bit with any questions"
hookah,3e5g4c,gayhomophob3,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:05:57 2015 UTC,"Brief experience helping a friend with his lounge. I would say not use any expensive bowls, because they are prone to breaking. Large, cheap Egyptian bowls should be fine. I agree with Gragorovich's suggestion of the hookah/hose. Your customers will appreciate coconut coals, and being indoors will probably reduce the smell using those.  Your startup costs can be pretty big depending on the style you're going for. Stoves, couches, music system, lighting, hookahs, bowls, shisha, coals, rent, to name some expenses. Unless you have been saving for a while you might need to take out a loan and have a business plan. However, you should always start small and work your way up. Being around a college usually helps too since that will be your biggest audience. Also you could ask for financial advice from a CPA if you know for a fact you want to do this. This may be especially useful because they can help you with calculating the cost/profit you may see. I wish you the best of luck!"

With AF, just about any fruit flavor with AF mint or AF fresh is a wonderful mix.  If they have Haze, go for either 50 Cents a Cup and What-a-mint, or Candy Apple Love and What-a-mint. 50CaC/W-a-m is more of a minty pink lemonade, unlike the Fumari mix, and CAL/W-a-m is like a sour candy apple (NOT a caramel apple; a very sweet candy apple)."

hookah,3e4v3n,Misterpopo06,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:59:34 2015 UTC,"I would suggest Lavoo, I own the mp5 model and it never lets me down. It's wide open, super easy to maintain and nice quality thick glass. I do suggest getting a better hose and a bowl adapter so you can place other bowls. Even though the stock bowl that comes with is nice, it is pretty deep. Let me know if you have any questions."
hookah,3e4v3n,gayhomophob3,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:15:04 2015 UTC,Regal  Alum D hose   Phunnel bowl - Tempura bowl  Lule Tray  And base you have your options  Or you could also look into Shikas
hookah,3e3xu3,BurritoIsLife,3,Tue Jul 21 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"I would first get a decent clay phunnel bowl like the Alien Mini or a tangiers small. If you have the hose that came with the KM then you should be fine for a while, but make sure you don't wash it or it will rust. Next I would recommend that you think about the lotus. It's a hefty sum of money but worth it in my opinion. I remember reading somewhere on this forum about a supplier on ebay that sells authentic lotus's for $25. If you search around I'm sure you could find the thread.  Also make sure you are using natural coals.This is even more important than getting a new bowl. The bad taste given off by quicklights (not to mention the health effects) is so bad it ruins a session for me.  Enjoy your new hookah!"
hookah,3e3xu3,computer7geek9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips, how would you Recommend I clean the hose? Cause I have two flavors for it and whenever I switch I can taste the other flavor a tad bit."
hookah,3e3xu3,BetterOffBen,2,Tue Jul 21 21:50:50 2015 UTC,"You don't clean the hose you've got. All you can really do is blow hard through it. Washing it will shorten its life by a lot. But here are my recommendations as far as upgrades:  1) Natural coals. Such as Haze or Titanium.  2) Good washable hose. I like the D-hose, aluminum or hybrid handle. They are a bit more expensive than others, but will hold up better.  3) A good phunnel bowl. The Harmony or OG Rook are good, or Alien Mini if you want something smaller.  4) Kaloud Lotus. Not really a necessary upgrade, but most like it for the consistency and convenience.   As far as flavors or brands, I'd say to just try out whatever sounds good. Everyone's taste is a bit different, so experiment to find what you like. But I saw you like fruity and minty, so you might try out Starbuzz Hard Rush."
hookah,3e3xu3,darkone253,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:58:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of this (could take or leave the Lotus, but I never have issues using foil). Once the KM hose rusts (and it will, eventually) the Grand Caravan washable is a pretty comparable replacement, imo."
hookah,3e3xu3,computer7geek9,2,Tue Jul 21 20:24:33 2015 UTC,I took apart my first KM hose about 6 months ago just for shiggles and it was disgusting. I did use it everyday for a year though...
hookah,3e3xu3,darkone253,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:03:43 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. I am sure some of the hoses I've had aren't too pretty inside...
hookah,3e3xu3,saharahookah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:14 2015 UTC,"You should get the apple on top for the bowl, I really enjoy using it because it helps the tobacco last longer. As for the KM hose that it came with do not wash it, it will ruin it. I recommend buying the KM washable hose, probably the best traditional hose I've found so far especially since your using a KM mini beast. Silicon hoses work great too as well as a generic washable hose which is cheaper than most silicon hoses but around the same price as the KM washable hose. For flavors I personally enjoy fumari, especially their spiced chai flavor. It has a very relaxing smooth smoke to it, not to mention the wonderful smell that comes from it. If you like to poke your own holes and use foil than get a vortex bowl, in my opinion they make good smoke production and are longer lasting than other traditional bowls. Also good choice with the KM mini beast. Its one of my favorite personal hookahs. I run a website called http://sahara-hookah.com where we sell all those products I mentioned. Also enjoy your hookah!!"
hookah,3e3xu3,HookahFresh,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:38:19 2015 UTC,"When you buy a hookah the three best upgrades for smoke quality and enjoyment are a quality hose, a quality phunnel, and a lotus. In that order. Each one makes a big difference for your sessions as your add them."
hookah,3e3xu3,KershawsBabyMama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:40:56 2015 UTC,I can see everyone here recommends I buy a lotus. Does it really make a huge difference?
hookah,3e3xu3,LawH00kah,2,Tue Jul 21 21:53:42 2015 UTC,"Somewhat. It makes a huge difference in the ease of use. You can get just as good of a smoke sessions with heavy duty foil as you can with a Lotus, foil just requires more attention. Heat management is much trickier, and it takes a while to master.  I likely have the same hookah as you, and I love it. I have an Alien Mini phunnel (great bowl, perfect for use for 1-4 smokers, lasts 60-90 minutes), Fancy Nuhose (washable hose for like $4, best bang for your buck out there), and a Lotus. I use the Lotus most of the time over foil because you don't really have to mess with it. If you have people over, or are playing video games, or just don't want to think about your session it's freakin awesome."
hookah,3e3xu3,LawH00kah,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:15:34 2015 UTC,"Well let us know what you like? If you like candy like shisha that wont burn easy then I'd go with starbuzz. (skip hookahfina I recently tried electric lotus and man that stuff tasted like soap)  If you want something cheaper but really good I'd say go with al fakher.  I'd stay away from Al Amir, though it gave a good taste and a decent smoke, it had a pepper taste in the papaya mango.  If you let me know what flavors, price you want to pay, and if you are in it for more teh thunder clouds or taste I can recommend some brands."
hookah,3e3xu3,hatiwulf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:01 2015 UTC,I like fruity flavors or anything really minty. And I would say I do love anything that provides thunder clouds.  Thanks for the help!

hookah,3e35jq,andycal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:45 2015 UTC,Congrats on your life-changing decision. First of all you get varying mileage when preparing your hookahs at home. That being said you would get the most amazing sessions just there. Gather your collection and smoke the flavors without mixing first to get a taste of them all and from then on you can start doing mixes. Getting a better bowl and hose + kaloud are steps you might consider once you get familiar with the methodology.  p.s. you AM reference made us all laugh in the office
hookah,3e35jq,alienshapes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:56 2015 UTC,"Assuming you have just the basic Egyptian bowl (clay bowl with 5 or so holes in the bottom of the cupped portion), you will want to get a different bowl for steam stones. Like juicier shisha, the juices from the stones tend to drip down the holes and into your stem/base. A vortex or phunnel bowl would work best.  Other tips: Natural coals are best, but take longer to light and can't be lit with a lighter.  Get a washable hose if yours isn't already. You can tell this by taking a magnet to it. If the magnet sticks, then it's not washable and you should avoid washing it, since the metal could can rust out."

I don't hang around here as much as I used to but I haven't seen these ""noob trap"" comments.  So I'm not sure what you are referring to.  When you buy a hookah the three best upgrades for smoke quality and enjoyment are a quality hose, a quality phunnel, and a lotus.  In that order.  Each one makes a big difference for your sessions as your add them.  Edit:  just to add, I don't see how anyone could argue that a quality session for 2 1/2 to 3 hours with only three coals on a lotus vs at least four to six coals with foil for a three hour session could possibly be even remotely in the same ballpark as justifiable to argue as a reason not to get a lotus.  Id tell anyone to get one just based on the money they save you in coals."

hookah,3dy5p0,eweyb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:20:44 2015 UTC,Apologies - noob trap was strong haha. Changed my wording. But I was referring to the general sentiment that the Lotus was a crutch and real pros and veterans use just foil.

hookah,3dy5p0,Yankeedude252,2,Tue Jul 21 03:18:53 2015 UTC,"I love my lotus. My only issue is that I feel like sometimes I'm getting less flavor than with foil. I'm not really sure if that's true or not, but it just seems that way for some reason."
hookah,3dy5p0,Yankeedude252,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:25 2015 UTC,Haha I've never had the flavor issue with the Lotus. I'm not sure why it would? Maybe you're not using enough heat. But yes. Love the Lotus. Also really want the MIG Razor.
hookah,3dy5p0,explodingmonk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:51 2015 UTC,"Ah, if you've never had the issue it probably has to do with my pack. I'm still kinda confused about packing for the Lotus, because everyone always says that it should just touch the nubs, but then packs it all the way up the rim where the shisha is mashed up against the entire surface."
hookah,3dy5p0,BetterOffBen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:55:40 2015 UTC,"Haha. I recommend packing it high enough that it makes good solid contact with the wider surface of the Lotus. In my opinion, packing to the nubs isn't enough!"

hookah,3dy5p0,dduurrttyy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:12:22 2015 UTC,"What are you smoking and how many coals are you using? Santino (maker of Crown bowls) made a good point: ""never smoke an under packed bowl, too much air circulating reduces your heat, which more or less boils off the nicotine, giving you a very rough, flavorless, thin smoke. """
hookah,3dy5p0,Bluesfire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:21:39 2015 UTC,"The brands of shisha I use are AF, Fumari, Argelini, Social Smoke, and occasionally something like FML. I used Haze coconut coals for a while, and used three of them. Now I've got some Mazaya square coals that I like a bit better, and I still use three of them. If I pack anything to where it touches the Lotus, including Haze, it burns like hell within fifteen minutes. This is using a Harmony bowl, by the way.  I underpack all the time and never get harsh, thin, OR flavorless smoke. I've been doing this for a while now, probably closing in on a year, and I promise you, I get as big of clouds as me or any of my hookah-smoking friends have ever seen. As a matter of fact, my friends prefer coming to my place to smoke rather than doing it themselves because I do it so much better than they do.  I wish I could figure out why shisha is so much more sensitive to heat for me than for others, because I can't even enjoy something like Haze. Haze either doesn't smoke well or burns, I've tried countless times and never found a combination that even gets a half-decent session out of it."
hookah,3dy5p0,daevl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:49:15 2015 UTC,"I might have to agree with you on that flavor bit. The first time I bought Tangiers Tropical Punch, my friends and I absolutely LOVED that flavor. Then sometime after I used it up, I got the Lotus and ordered some more Tropical Punch. It just wasn't the same. I chalked it up to a bad batch until I bought another batch and had the same issue. That said, I always very easily would get an ash taste to my shisha back when I used foil, and occasionally I'd pick up the coal taste. I'll never give up my lotus, but I may go back to foil and give tropical punch another shot for a little bit."
hookah,3dy5p0,HookahTom,2,Mon Jul 20 23:27:39 2015 UTC,"I got my Lotus about 6 months ago after using foil for years. I held out on getting one because I thought it was overpriced (which it is, honestly). Then I had some Amazon gift cards and saw one for $37 (pink handle of course) so I got it. I don't think I've used foil since. I really don't see a noticeable difference between the two methods and agree that the Lotus gives a much more consistent session start to finish due to the heat dissipation and reduced heat output. I enjoy the convenience of not having to rotate coals, which has led to far fewer accidents with dropping coals. I also find it is very hard to overheat the bowl while using the Lotus.   I would disagree with the point you made about being screwed hard if you get too much heat; you'll notice it getting too hot, and if you pull a coal or open the vent or take the lid off, then I find the temperature drops to a good range pretty quickly and you're good to go. That said, if you leave it sitting there burning for several minutes, then yeah, that bowl is toast. Though the same is true with foil.   At the end of the day, smoking hookah is all about the smokers' enjoyment. It's a personal experience. Feel free to do whatever makes you happiest."
hookah,3dy5p0,fuzzymidget,2,Mon Jul 20 20:22:09 2015 UTC,Lotus allows me to bale lazy and not have to faff around with foil.
hookah,3dy5p0,Yankeedude252,2,Mon Jul 20 20:35:08 2015 UTC,"Was a huge lotus fan, got the fireflower now and its just much better, really would like a MIG razor next but so expensive.  Fireflower feels very much like a lotus 2.0 to me, Really good changes they have made, can fit 3 full size flats easily or 6 stonehenged flats (not that you would ever need to) and the ridges on the bottom are great to stop the coals going out.  Only downside is that vents open on the fireflower doesn't seem to cool it down as much as open vents on the lotus so I need to remove the lid more often near the beginning of a session. But I find 3 flats, lid on to heat up, remove lid for awhile and then lid on vents open then vents closed is perfect for a round of coals on a small bowl  I still use foil sometimes, mainly if i'm having a party as I prepack a bunch of bowls and foil and hole them at the beginning of the night and just grab them and swap them as each bowl is done."
hookah,3dy5p0,fuzzymidget,2,Mon Jul 20 20:48:22 2015 UTC,"Started with foil, bought a lotus. I love it but every now and again I do foil bowls as well because they both have pros and cons."

hookah,3dy5p0,AdamantiumFoil,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:48 2015 UTC,Read the post but not the comments. Honestly I believe it comes down to personal preference. I do not look on a lotus as a disability. Do I think everyone should learn foil? Absolutely. Do I think foil is better? I'm not really inclined to say yes or no. I love my lotus. I love foil. Both are great in the end it all is about enjoying your session. If you are happy then that's what matters. I use foil more than a lotus but that's just because I like the ritual of setting up my bowl and poking holes. Nothing wrong with either way IMHO
hookah,3dy5p0,fuzzymidget,3,Tue Jul 21 16:15:20 2015 UTC,Never going back to foil.  Might someday swap out the samsaris though one day and see what an alien mini does with the lotus.

hookah,3dy5p0,fuzzymidget,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"Is that a brand specific commentary or just sort of in general?  I see people using different bowls, but the I bought the combination with the samsaris so I've kinda been just going with it as a unit."
hookah,3dy5p0,AdamantiumFoil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:19:01 2015 UTC,"I bought the Samsaris long after I bought my Lotus. I had been using the Lotus with a cheap phunnel bowl. The Samsaris never smoked right for me; it constantly burned the shisha. The phunnel worked great, and I got a Harmony bowl and it's fantastic with the Lotus.  As far as the Alien Mini goes, one of my friends bought one and I tried it out with my lotus and worked beautifully. You have to be careful not to overpack it (or, I do anyway. I seem to pack much lower than other people and get the same results) but it does work great."

hookah,3dy5p0,computer7geek9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:07 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. It fits well, in my opinion, but depending on the shape of yours you may have to move it around a little to get it just right. I usually just put myself eye-level with where the mini and lotus meet and scoot the lotus until I can't see any more light at the join.  Sorry for assuming!"
hookah,3dy5p0,mattymogue,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:25:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds good, I will try.  Do you still pack even to the top of the spire?  Or do the nibs on the lotus mean you have to pack a little lower to keep from contacting the shisha?"
hookah,3dy5p0,sorell42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:56:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do! I know I've got it right when there are just a few flecks of tobacco sticking up over the rim. More often, though I leave a little hint of my char line when I clean and I make sure I just pack below that.   I end up getting sessions (with Tangiers especially) where the entire contents of the bowl lift up when I pick up the lotus and the only contact points are the very ends of the nubs. That's some special kind of satisfying!"
hookah,3dy5p0,sorell42,2,Mon Jul 20 22:54:23 2015 UTC,"The perfect hookah coal would be an electric one.  Specifically, one that can regulate temperature as accurately as a Storz and Bickel Volcano digital.  Vaporizers keep a ceramic/metal plate heated to an exact temperature, and that would be ideal for hookah smoking.  Never have to mess with coals, never have to worry about ashing or rotating or over/underheating and harsh smoke.  The downside, obviously, is the expense, and scaling it to work with a hookah bowl."
hookah,3dy5p0,explodingmonk,3,Mon Jul 20 17:41:30 2015 UTC,"and then a conveyer that is slowly pushing new shish in (perfectly doing so, of course) so that you have a perfect never ending smoke... but then you have the think about the hookah itself. I could imagine a self-cleansing stem and base, but the hose would become way too bulky in order to clean itself... but maybe not... maybe a tube of chilled water could me running up the hose that could fill some tip apparatus as well as being able to clean out the hose. Materials engineering could probably do a better job at this..  Edit: [7]"
hookah,3dy5p0,sorell42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:18 2015 UTC,"Great Job! I personally am a huge lotus fan and like you said, many people seem to think I'm a noob for using it 80% of the time.   My thoughts on the lotus if anyone cares  Most of the time I'm smoking with a group of people and I don't want to spend alotta time messing with the hookah. The lotus makes it easy to walk away for 15 min and not have to worry about the bowl getting torched. Its pretty much idiot-proof to teach heat management to anyone with an IQ higher than a rock as long as I pack the bowl myself (I hate those idiots who've smoked starbuzz and QL twice and somehow think they're experts and should pack my bowl with my shisha).  I use foil the other 20% of the time when I'm smoking alone or with my roommate. I don't get as consistent results, but when it's good it is much more flavorful than when its good with the lotus.  TLDR: Lotus = less work, more consistent, slightly diminished flavor. Great for parties so I can walk away Foil = more work, less consistent, better flavor when it is good. Great for smoking alone or with small group"
hookah,3dy5p0,tylerseher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:45:58 2015 UTC,Thanks man! I agree with you except I think I get the same amount of flavor with the Lotus as I do with foil. Might be because I use as much heat as possible with the Lotus too.
hookah,3dy5p0,tylerseher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:53 2015 UTC,I started using the Lotus and haven't looked back. I even converted a homegrown Israeli and even he said he doesn't use foil anymore. Solid product.

Something else I've noticed is if my spire on one of my funnels is too high, the lotus may sit on that and cause problems. Overall, with the alien minis I've had, the draw is better than what I used to get with foil, but then I almost always had to use a toothpick or something with foil to ensure it wouldn't get sucked into the spire."

I'm my experiences a properly managed bowl with foil can yield the same results, flavor wise, vs a bowl with a lotus. When it comes to more traditional tobaccos (like Nakhla/Zaghloul, Desi Murli, Jurak) the lotus doesn't get hot enough to where I can get the full flavor from them.   I get that heat management can be a difficult and frustrating thing to learn, especially for some newbies, but it is a very good skill to have when it comes to smoking hookah. By not learning how to manage heat you are relying on the lotus as a proverbial ""crutch"", and if you find yourself in a situation in which you can't use your lotus, you'll more than likely find yourself SOL."

hookah,3dxw3z,TheHapdaddy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:40 2015 UTC,"I've literally dripped it and banged it against things and it hasn't chipped anything. It's just from the bowl being put on and off I'm sure! And I use it elusively, several times a day."
hookah,3dxw3z,The_Kommunist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:33 2015 UTC,"Ahh the text to your review finally loaded! Well said, I agree with all of it. The only place I had the black come off of the stem is where the grommet sits for the bowl. Completely fine with that. Glad to know that I just had one of the defective bases. I kept getting confused when the paint came off on my hands after cleaning the base."
hookah,3dxw3z,MrFoolinaround,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:48 2015 UTC,"Really? I despise that bowl. The hookah is great but I really dislike the bowl. I've tried it with different coals, different shisha, and different packs and I can't get it to heat well. The coals never seem to toast the shisha enough. I've never had this problem with any other bowl before. I feel like it has to do with the odd spire in the middle which connects to the hookah. It's really tall and doesn't allow you to place the foil on flush. Maybe I got a bad one with a really tall spire but I really dislike it. Next haul I'm buying another bowl but for now I'm using the discounted lotus/samsaris combo that I picked up at the same time.  Also I've noticed that my paint is resilient UNLESS I'm scrubbing under warm water. I really like cleaning my hookah before/after every use so I had to use cold water for the outside or just clean the inside which is the important part anyways. Either way the paint on this guy is the most resilient I've had so far. Many would just fall off without any cleaning!  Edit: added section about chipping"

A pipe in the souke will go for a lot (500+ diram) but dont be scaredt to talk the price down to half, if he say no walk away and they usely go for the deal."

hookah,3dxj04,PerfectlyAwful,2,Mon Jul 20 22:23:39 2015 UTC,"Oil should be done every 3-5k  Coolant I flush and change every year  Brake fluid I do every year  Tranny fluid and diff fluid I do when ever the recommended change time is.   You can change your oil very easily, jack it up, put a pan under it, pop off the oil cap, and undo the bolt on the oil pan. Then put the bolt back in and fill her up  Coolant: there should be a plug on the bottom of your radiator, pull the plug out (obviously when the engine is cold) and let it drain. If there's no plug just pop the bottom radiator hose off. When no more colored liquid comes out, put the plug (or hose) back on, and fill with water. Go for a drive, let the engine cool off, and drain. Repeat until the water comes out clear and top off with coolant.   Flushing and bleeding brakes sucks, YouTube it lol  Tranny and diff fluid, I've only ever done it once, YouTube can help you here as well.   Oil is the most important to change. As long as you change your oil and coolant, your car will be happy.   If you want cheap labor, go to your local parts store and see if any of the employees work on cars. One of them probably does and will give you a deal on labor"
hookah,3dxj04,PerfectlyAwful,2,Mon Jul 20 23:13:12 2015 UTC,"Also: another cheaper alternitive to paying the stealership 400 dollars is to do it your self. YouTube is an AMAZINGLY resource to learn how to do maintenance. A few great channels are chrisfix, ericthecarguy, and mighty car mods (if you like to learn a few diy things and like turbos lol) But Chris fix and ericthecarguy are great channels. Although: Chris fix is more of a ""quick but detailed video"" and does more ""common repairs"", while etcg does long very informational videos about everything from oil changes to pulling transmissions lol"

Basically I take flat strips of steel and make it into tube (round, square, triangle, oval, octagon, D oval, etc). I weld the strips together, I weld the tube together, form the tube into the shape (all tube starts off as circle round) and then stack it on to lifts. My machine on average does sizes from 5/8"" round up to 2"" round, and my company does up to 7"" round and 1/2"" thick. I do cold roll, hot roll, galvanized, aluminized, and a bunch of others.

hookah,3dzpcp,uneverknow,3,Mon Jul 20 20:59:44 2015 UTC,quick lights are notorious for causing headaches. A lot of people get them if they smoke on an empty stomach. Some times you might get them from a very restricted hookah. For me I found that I get unbearable migraines if I'm not hydrated enough. I used to get them constantly during Ramadan. So make sure you drink a lot of water before and while smoking. From what I understand it has a lot to do with oxygen levels in the brain.

hookah,3dzpcp,MzazAj,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:42 2015 UTC,"Haha no worries, I was just reading about it, so it's both CO2(carbon dioxide) & CO(carbon monoxide) which is usually the cause of carbon monoxide poisoning. CO "" is produced by the incomplete burning of various fuels, including coal, wood, charcoal"" so I think the way a quick light burns produces more CO which is much worse than CO2 apparently a long side the chemicals put in it to make light quickly, make a recipe for disaster.""Carbon monoxide can be produced whenever there is insufficient oxygen for combustion. Coal will produce CO if it was burned in a closed space and little air or oxygen is present but if it was burnt in open air the combustion goes to completion with formation of CO2. ""  I guess that's why we're always told to fully light the coals before using them.   Anyways, I'm just rambling right now you obviously don't need to know all this, but the more you know I guess :P   EDIT: if that's not scientifically sound, please correct me!"

Try having a Pepsi with your hookah a couple of times and tell us if your problem persists. A friend of mine didn't drink nor eat before or while smoking and had frequent complaints. ""I tell you, when my stomach and head begin to hurt I CAN'T consume nourishments."" I had him force-drink a pop and while it didn't go away, it eased his pains. Today he regularly uses sugar and a 3/5 full stomach as a preventive measures and suffers no more aches. Hope I could help."

hookah,3dy3rm,Vaalic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:39:28 2015 UTC,"True. The website says you can actually specify what composition of VG and FG you want.       Our standard retail ratio is 60% PG / 40% VG. However, if you wish for a different variation, you may select that during checkout.     Apparently, coals burn between 350°C-450°C and the autoignition temperature of VG(vegetable glycerin) and PG(propylene glycerin) are 400°C and 370°C         respectively.   I couldn't really find any stats on how hot the actual shisha burns in the bowl but I'd imagine it's at least 75-100°C lower than the coals.  Edit: So I wonder if there would be an optimal ratio of PG/VG to make shisha."
hookah,3dy3rm,PerfectlyAwful,2,Mon Jul 20 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not to sure about how hot the actually shisha burns, but if you use a lotus, I suppose you could pop it off, set it in the ash tray and get a temperature reading (One of those infrared laser thermometers would probably be best, I don't know if regular thermometers will read high enough to get a good reading). It would be a good idea if you decide to go with the VG/FG liquid that way its not wasted money or flavorless tobacco after 5 minutes."

You could try patching it with silicone sealant, I'd go with the stuff made for aquariums so you know there's not going to be chemicals leaching into the water.   Are there no smoke shops around you? If there are then I'd check with them before ordering a new one, since a decent shop should carry bases. If not then Hookah-Shisha is a fine place to order one, KM bases are currently $16 dollars there, I don't think you'll beat that.

hookah,3duqza,hatiwulf,6,Sun Jul 19 17:50:15 2015 UTC,"The cans of shisha is of the brand ""dubai shatra"", its a very good tobacco compareable to fumari in wetness and cut.  The 2 bags are of a brand ""Panorama"" , this one is dyed red and has a similiar cut and smoke session as al fakher tobacco.  Lastly i found a glass Dhose here (glass mouthpiece is in my bag) for 15€ and a very stury pair of tongs for 5€"
hookah,3duqza,djmik21,4,Sun Jul 19 17:51:58 2015 UTC,Where did you get these? Is that hose good?

hookah,3duqza,alienshapes,2,Sun Jul 19 19:58:30 2015 UTC,The hose looks a bit like this one http://www.amazon.de/dp/B00E0IGWX2/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=1TUUHKHOEL212&coliid=I3FE73VI3F9E55&psc=1 it is a link to german amazon because i am from here. These hoses are very common but have a nice draw
hookah,3duqza,filthy_dwarf,3,Mon Jul 20 00:10:42 2015 UTC,No! Dubai shatra is anything like fumari. It's a disguisting cheap brand of mixed tobacco with any flavoring they could get. We can trade fumari for shatra pound for pound any day you want though :) We were baffled to see that thing in the picture and thus the reaction.
hookah,3duqza,alienshapes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:35:37 2015 UTC,it is crap and it isn't even tobacco. it's herbal
hookah,3duqza,TripleOGtripleTriple,3,Sun Jul 19 20:42:28 2015 UTC,"It is produced(or at least packed) in Bulgaria and is tobacco. Haven't heard of them going herbal, but this particular brand has become a narrative for bad shisha in here."

hookah,3dwxof,HotPocketPanda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:48:20 2015 UTC,I got it from Southsmoke which is a pretty reputable dealer here.

hookah,3dswzu,TheSwedishOprah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:18:41 2015 UTC,"Not too particular on the brands, but I find that a 50/50 blend of Double Apple and Mint is the sweet spot for me.

hookah,3dswzu,TheSwedishOprah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:34:01 2015 UTC,That mix is very good. Although crushed altoids is something that I've never tried and need to.
hookah,3dswzu,Tsukiyomi471,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:57:57 2015 UTC,"Probably my favorite base additive. Get a box of the really nice minty ones (spearmint, peppermint) and then crush up 8-10 of them (or more or less depending on how big your base is). Powderizing them in a mortar & pestle is best, bashing the zut alors! out of them with a cookpot or rolling pin on a cutting board is also acceptable (though messier). However you do it, pour the powdered bits into your base containing about 1/3 the total amount of liquid you normally use and swirl it around for 30 seconds or so to let them dissolve a bit. Fill your base up to the regular amount and prepare yourself for minty smoky goodness."

hookah,3dqenl,-_SFW_-,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:04:14 2015 UTC,Haven't even touched my lotus since I got the fireflower. Only problem is I keep forgetting it doesn't have a silicon handle and burning my fingers when opening the vents.
hookah,3dqenl,-_SFW_-,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:47:43 2015 UTC,Move it from the lotus?
hookah,3dqenl,LennieBriscoe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:49:18 2015 UTC,Doesn't fit snug and falls off too easily :(

hookah,3dslyp,tdasnowman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:20:20 2015 UTC,It takes a while but I stonehenge them and flip 3 times in 15 minutes. When I'm ready to take them out I hold them over the flame for a minute or two to make sure everything got covered. It takes time but it works
hookah,3dslyp,amg788,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:17:15 2015 UTC,If you want you can look inside the burner. The wires are probably just disconnected it happens alot. Just put them back on their slots and it will work again. Have done this like a million times and just ended up stripping them and wrapping the wire around the connections
