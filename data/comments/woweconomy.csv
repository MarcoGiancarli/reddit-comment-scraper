woweconomy,3e5sew,DasChokobo,2,Wed Jul 22 04:22:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, level 25 pets are usually harder to sell because your buyer pool is very small. Level 1 battle pets will be bought up for gold xferring purposes (people cant always do this with high level pets unless they have a pet that high level already) across realms and a lot of people prefer to level their own pets as well, as thats part of the fun in it.  So usually I avoid buying any pet higher than level 1, unless its like a 15k pet for 100g or something rediculous.  You have to just keep selling for a long time, and watch prices over a long time period. You'll notice some pets are always up for sale super cheap somewhere despite having a high sell value. These pets are usually best avoided as they tend to have crappy turn arounds on profit.   TCG pets and guardian cubs are almost always good snags with decent turn around.   I also think that its good to hoard garrison pets and WoD raid pets / random zone drop pets now, as once the next xpack releases the supply should dry up and price will increase.  Other than this I always suggest sending your big buyers a mail or message in game, thanking them and offering discounts. You can sometimes snag some really good repeat business and its win-win for the both of you. A week ago I made 400k in one day doing this. Someone bought two of my highest priced pets of the AH, I pmed him and told him ill give him great discounts on anything he wants and sent him a list with a few other good ones I had. He ended up buying 200-300k on the spot, then he kept buying off the AH from me all day while I was at work, simply because he was happy I gave him such good discounts."

I'd pick a single stat (say, int), craft one of each old world gem, and post them on the AH at a price that guarantees you, say, a 10% profit margin (after the AH cut and deposit).  See which sell and on what time frame (if any).  For those that sell, increase the margin until your sales drop off.  You need to understand how the quantity posted affects your sales, too, but I'm proposing starting with margin first because it's the cheaper experiment — you'll only ever be ""stuck"" with at most one gem that you know you can sell for less while still making a profit.  The 10% margin is arbitrary, but anything less than that and it's almost certainly not worth it unless you find that there's a huge amount of demand at that price.  After this experiment, you might find that only MoP gems sell, in which case you've ""tackled this mess"", as you call it, by learning that you can avoid it entirely. :)"

In the herbs example, an operation could say my maximum price I want to pay is 1g each. When I search for those items I will only see auctions that I can buy for 1g and under.

woweconomy,3e2dui,Manstus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:28 2015 UTC,"Watcher would neither confirm nor deny any further questions about it, and he explicitly states in the interview that they're leaving that sort of information vague so people can't just find a new way to game garrison missions.  So, basically, we don't know.  Anything you see or hear is anecdotal.  Do note that he specifically addressed the question in response to the early front-runner theory of ""always log onto your main first, so it will show up there"" and he debunked it, that it wasn't generated by characters.  So, basically, I think its safe to say, if you see it - run it.  You are not likely to see it again for another week, whether you complete it or not.  Then again, you were not likely to see it in a given a week whether or not you saw or completed it already that week to begin with.  Some people don't even see the mission once in a month or two."

woweconomy,3e0u3x,Frostslayer,4,Tue Jul 21 02:17:33 2015 UTC,"First of all its important that you understand that no one can really tell you if it's worth it to get into the enchanting market or not because it varies wildly from server to server.   Having said that, enchanting is profitable on my server. I sell literally every WoD enchant that will return a profit. If constant undercutting drives my margin down I will typically reset the market. Again, it's important to note that this works only on some servers.   As  general rule you can expect higher total profits on the big ones, weapon enchants, but perhaps high margins on the cheap enchants. Remember, every server is different and you should always take gold making advice with a grain of salt."
woweconomy,3e0u3x,biscodiscuits,4,Tue Jul 21 02:42:32 2015 UTC,"Do you buy mats and then craft enchants?   Yes.   If so what type of enchants do you make?   It varies over time.  There are cycles related to gear slots, cycles related to secondary stats, and cycles related to server-level things.  There's not a WoD enchant I haven't sold for a decent margin at some point on my server.  Assuming the your market actually supports a profit margin, you'll be able to make gold if you keep your costs down and start with small, inexpensive experiments."
woweconomy,3e0u3x,chiburrito,3,Tue Jul 21 02:45:06 2015 UTC,"I buy all my materials. I keep 20-40 of every WoD enchant in stock and post them whenever they are profitable.

I started at buying at 250g/piece but I wasn't seeing enough earlier this week. So I increased it to 300g/piece as a max buy price. I am going to see how it goes.

I just bought a ton of felblight the past couple of days and last week I was watching for sorcerous materials for under 20g/piece. I would transmute those  to sorcerous earth and sell for 45g/piece. I have sold about 1200 this week and I bought 360 felblight and sold 330 this week. That includes some that I got for killing kazzak on 8 toons.

woweconomy,3dxwgg,gumdropsEU,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:56 2015 UTC,"This is where you crafting operations come in - once you've created a crafting operation you can set a minimum profit (even if it's 10g or something quite low), TSM will not queue a craft for you unless it will generate 10g profit.  Now, once you understand that, you can go further in to it by modifying how TSM calculates how much it costs to make something, and how TSM calculates how much something is worth - by default TSM looks at the lowest listed auction of the item you want to craft, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to sell at that price. You should be fine for things in current WoD markets like crafted items from each profession, just be careful on assigning that type of 10g minimum profit to everything you can craft because it could have you creating things that don't sell."

woweconomy,3dxwgg,dynodanz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:37:21 2015 UTC,That is probably a good chance that this is what is going on.

woweconomy,3dxwgg,aphoenix,2,Mon Jul 20 21:39:25 2015 UTC,"What? You crazy, that's not happening at all. Crazy talk I say  (thanks for letting me know)"
woweconomy,3dxwgg,RIP_IN_PEAS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:41:24 2015 UTC,Two things: 1. Is it possible to download finished profiles for TSM? 2. Is it possible to flip the AH with TSM?  Any links to good guides are very appreciated.
woweconomy,3dxwgg,gumdropsEU,2,Tue Jul 21 13:31:58 2015 UTC,"If you can find one, sure. But probably not the best way to learn how to use TSM. Yes. Check out the guides on the TSM site to get familiar with some key concepts the addon uses to get started: https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/addon/guides"
woweconomy,3dyq5k,Evilfart123,12,Mon Jul 20 16:52:50 2015 UTC,"The answer to this is anything and everything, research your realm through TuJ and TSM sites to figure out what is selling and what markets are under-represented or not represented at all.  Look at trade materials, enchants, gems, consumables, new and old world crafts, mounts, transmog, glyphs - it's up to you what you want to invest your time in to."
woweconomy,3dyq5k,gumdropsEU,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:05 2015 UTC,Ill look into that.
woweconomy,3dyq5k,shawncoons,2,Mon Jul 20 17:01:10 2015 UTC,So how about this question? Which strategies work better on high pop servers?  Which work better on low pop servers?
woweconomy,3dyq5k,ElmoTeHAzN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:53 2015 UTC,Med pop. I play the ah.  I've made over 17k just flipping thinks
woweconomy,3dyq5k,Siegfriedthelion,3,Mon Jul 20 20:36:05 2015 UTC,GundropsEU is right on
woweconomy,3dyq5k,godlessgamergirl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:59:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's funny that your comment is upvoted more than Gumdrops' actual comment is.    Just to add my 2 cents - margins on crafted high volume items can be super slim on high pop servers.  I prefer to select markets that have lower volume but less competition, like low level crafted twink items and tmog.  Flipping is always a good option.  If you're running TSM just do a search on /armor and look through the stuff that is listed for under 5% market value.  If any of it looks cool or has stats that someone might want as they are leveling up, buy it and repost it higher."
woweconomy,3dyq5k,Ogoncho,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:32 2015 UTC,"As someone who's never done twinking, and is trying to scrape by finding low-competition markets on a high-pop server, how do I identify ""twink items?"""
woweconomy,3dyq5k,ThumpaMonsta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:29 2015 UTC,"typically lvl 19-29-39 etc items, there is probably some website dedicated to twinking."
woweconomy,3dyk8o,Helicaster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:18 2015 UTC,"You're on the right track, but the flips you provided as an example have pretty small margins and are slightly higher risk (overall). What would be better is if you find something that's cheaper to purchase than to make it yourself.  For example my crafting cost of those Greater Strength flasks is currently ~15g. I have a shopping operation attached to them that will display anything that's below that crafting cost ready for purchasing and then I'll post them according to my auctioning operations. That way I've saved time on buying/gathering the materials to restock my auctions and did it without spending as much money (on average).  If you're going by colour - when it's 50% or lower it'll be coloured blue. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's listed at an underpriced amount, this comes with familiarity of your realm economy and other variables like recent patches or changes to items."
woweconomy,3dyk8o,gumdropsEU,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:29:16 2015 UTC,"Check out https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/great-deals for your server.  Those are the type of items I would flip.  Flasks have low profit margins and easily attainable mats, so I wouldn't bother with those unless you find them significantly below crafting cost."
woweconomy,3dyk8o,godlessgamergirl,0,Mon Jul 20 18:23:41 2015 UTC,"Ouch, not to follow if on low pop servers. The transmog market is inexistant here, things are listed at 6-10% of the global market price because they've been relisted forever and never sold."
woweconomy,3dyk8o,Swartz142,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:25:43 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  I started this myself this weekend with TSM.  After buying a token I was left with 17k.  Using TSM to see the lowest priced item I was able to buy and sell about 150k worth of items, with a 75k profit.  All from standing in one place.  I was able to buy ores for 1g as soon as they were posted and sold for 2.5g.    I snagged a Vial of the sands for 26k and sold for 40k.    Sniper is also great.  I managed to get around 500 of those flasks for 20g, and sold them all for around 2k.    Felblights is where I made most of my gold.  People off load them at LOW prices in trade constantly.  I got around 100+ between 100 and 250g.  I sell them in stacks of 10 for 3500g each and they always sell.  People dont like to buy singles.  Always think about the AH cut as well.  Dont buy something just because its 15% lower if its a low gold item.  The AH % will take away any profit."
woweconomy,3dy824,novaplane,7,Mon Jul 20 14:41:34 2015 UTC,TSM is the jam you need for your toast.
woweconomy,3dy824,biscodiscuits,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"Where is this option? I'm kinda green with TSM, and have been using a calculator to deduct the net profit before I post! Since it's obviously there already, could you point me to it?? Thanks!"
woweconomy,3dy824,Ogoncho,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:17 2015 UTC,"If you're looking at the profit from the crafting info in the item tooltip for example, it's already including the AH cut. Everything is already taking this in to account."
woweconomy,3dy824,gumdropsEU,2,Mon Jul 20 15:53:23 2015 UTC,"To add to what gumdrops said: In the general crafting options there is a ""Profit Deduction"" setting, that you can set to 5% to compensate for the AH cut (default is 5%)."
woweconomy,3dy824,BilisOnyxia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:00:26 2015 UTC,"OH. Lol. So, I've been taking an extra 5% off all this time. D'oh!"
woweconomy,3dy824,Ogoncho,2,Mon Jul 20 20:18:32 2015 UTC,"Oh gosh, I'm not able to hop in game atm so I'm not positive. I think TSM does this automatically tbh. I'll take a look and see, bit I've seen it before."
woweconomy,3dy824,biscodiscuits,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:14 2015 UTC,"Ok then maybe I'm missing it. I don't see the option to display that information. I'm still using TSM2, so maybe that's it? Or I'm just blind."
woweconomy,3dy824,chiburrito,3,Mon Jul 20 18:10:00 2015 UTC,"I think /u/biscodiscuits (and maybe others in this thread) misunderstood your problem.  If I understand you correctly, you're not interested in profit (net fees) of an item you might craft, you're interested in the profit (net fees) of something you might buy and repost.  There are two things I could see you asking for, depending on whether you mean target purchase price or target sale price when you say ""target price.""  Let's say you're looking at Sorcerous Fire on the AH and hovering over a listing for 30g per unit.   Say, for example, your target sale price was 45g.  You might have this set to your average sale price, or some function of the overall market price.  You'd want the tooltip to report the profit (net fees) if you were to buy the Fire at 30g and post it at 45g.  In this case, that'd be 12.75g or a 28% profit margin. Say, for example, your target purchase price was 15g.  You might have this set to your average purchase price.  You'd want to tooltip to report the profit (net fees) if you were to sell one of your current 15g Fires at 30g.  In this case, that'd be 13.5g or a 45% profit margin.   If you're talking about finding flip-worth mats, it seems more likely you mean ""target sale price.""  If the above is correct, I don't think TSM supports it directly.  You can create custom price sources and have them displayed in every tooltip, but as far as I know there's no way to say something like ""the price of whatever item I'm hovering over"" in TSM's price-source-language.  If that's true then I don't see how you could define a custom price source that included the information (alas).  The best way I can think of to hack this is to change how the ""% Market Value"" is calculated.  This is in the options for the Shopping module.  I forget what the default is, but mine is currently set to first(avgBuy, dbMarket) because I like the percentage to be relative to what I've paid in the past.  For things I buy continuously — enchanting mats, mostly — this is a better indicator of whether I'm getting a deal than the the default.  first(avgBuy, dbMarket) will evaluate to avgBuy if the current item has a valid avgBuy value and dbMarket otherwise.  If I just set it to use avgBuy as the ""Market Price"", I'd see nonsense for things I'd never purchased before.  Anyhow, hope that helps!  I'm not 100% sure I'm understanding your question, so I might've just written a lot of text for nothing. :D"
