SonyXperia,3e0y1d,GhettoNexus6,9,Tue Jul 21 02:51:16 2015 UTC,"This is always an issue with tech. ""Do I wait for the next version or buy what's available now?"". The correct answer is: If you have a need - buy now. Else you wait."
SonyXperia,3e0y1d,Durkadur_,5,Tue Jul 21 08:06:24 2015 UTC,If you really need a phone go Z3c. However at this point I think I'd start dissuading people from it unless they really want the phone. It's great on battery life/size. However lots of phones now are close in battery life and have considerably better cameras. The waterproof is hit/miss and the glass can be annoying. Don't get me wrong I love mine. It's a great all day travel phone but I wish the battery life and camera were better. Esp with international travel.
SonyXperia,3e0y1d,winThatSmile,4,Tue Jul 21 05:46:35 2015 UTC,"If you need it right now, get the Z3c, if you can wait, get the Z5c."
SonyXperia,3e0y1d,therealcamel,3,Tue Jul 21 08:26:59 2015 UTC,"Why you should wait for the Z5C:   They might offer double the internal storage (32GB instead of 16GB). There's also a chance they might use UFS or even a faster eMMC storage.  A 1080P screen around 4.6-5"".  Probably 3GB of RAM.  Exposed microUSB port is a lot better than a proprietary magnetic port. Choosing a Z5C is worth it for this one alone since you can just use a number of cables that you have around the house.  Faster updates. The Z5 series will be Sony's babies for the next six months in  terms of updates. You get a one to three month lead from the other eligible members of the Z series.    Why you should just go for the Z3C now:   What SoC will Sony put in it? An S808? An S810? In a lot of ways, both options are hardly an upgrade. If you get an S808, you'd be paying a lot more for the Z5C for something that's hardly better. If you get one with an S810, you might as well use your phone as an electric stove. Qualcomm really fucked up on this one.  Price. Are the improvements worth the price difference? This is something only you can decide. If you really need a phone now, it would be really hard to wait especially now that the tech industry is waiting for the deluge of phones that have switched to a Type C connector and the S820."

SonyXperia,3e0y1d,brycedriesenga,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:12 2015 UTC,"In a world where 5.5"" phones are now considered normal, then a 5"" phone would be considered compact/mini. We don't have to like it but that's how marketing works. As soon as Sony increases the size of the next Z flagship, the Z Compact line is bound to be larger as well. It sucks. Just four years ago, 4.3"" would be considered large and now even that's too small for a mini."
SonyXperia,3e0y1d,crackinthewall,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:35:27 2015 UTC,"Fair point. Whatever they call it, as long as I can still get a powerful 4.5""-ish phone, I'll be happy."

SonyXperia,3e0y1d,gskeyes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:14:21 2015 UTC,"To me personally:   Wireless charging: meh. It's nice to have it, but I tend to use my phone while charging, and that is not possible with Qi. This is besides being slow vs wired (1A charge speed, unless it uses the latest revision). USB port: exposed micro-B is nice, but Type C support on Day 1 would be killer for me. RAM: 2GB or 3GB is fine either way. Display: I don't mind 720p at all for a phone of this size. That said, 1080p? Why not. SoC: if it uses 810, I'm outta here, even if everything else is an improvement. 820... maybe. Internal storage: this really needs to be 32GB now, microSD slot notwithstanding. UFS 2.0... I'd value it more if there's a 64GB option. Camera: hardware-wise, it can use some image stabilization. Software-wise, man, the default camera software really needs to be stepped up, preferably to the Z3+ level in terms of competency. That said, 4K recording is meh."
SonyXperia,3e0y1d,jcpb,-3,Wed Jul 22 04:53:53 2015 UTC,Actually you should wait for the Z5c.  I have an friend in Sony Japan and said that this phone is the one he is been waiting for because it has a longer battery life and has a screen with very small bezels!  magnetic is not going away for Z5compact dude...
SonyXperia,3e0y1d,cr79,0,Tue Jul 21 02:54:06 2015 UTC,Magnetic charging's already gone for the Z3+ and the feature was half-heartedly supported for a while now. What are you bubbling on about?
