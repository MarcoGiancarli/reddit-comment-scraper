You want to give the impression that it's a miniature. If this was an actual miniature one or two boats would be in focus and the rest would be way too blurry to make out, because you'd be too close.  Your original photo is pretty cool though."

tiltshift,3d28mv,rhynes95,3,Mon Jul 13 21:41:05 2015 UTC,It looks like you just added a gradient blur to the top and bottom of the photograph. You need to be sure to add a field of focus to it too. I.e. The building to the left should be completely in focus and not be blurred out at all because it's in the same plane.  I'm not very good at explaining these kinds of things so I hope someone will reply with a better explanation.
tiltshift,3d28mv,DrZurn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:05:02 2015 UTC,Basically everything in the image should be in focus thus causing the all objects in the shot to be on the same plane like /u/IAmTheLastUnicorn said.

tiltshift,3cmili,Razzamafoo,7,Thu Jul 9 01:44:38 2015 UTC,"If you've got a lot of disposable income, a nice SLR camera and want to do it right, get a tilt shift lens. If you just want to have some fun making some neat images and wait and see if it sparks something really strongly inside you, do it digitally.   Yes, it's a rather simple technique and doesn't 100% create the effect a lens does and this seems to drive some people crazy, but it's close enough of an effect for a lot of people to evoke the same sense of wonder and whimsy. With Photoshop or Gimp, it's easy to learn from a quick tutorial."
tiltshift,3cmili,JRSly,3,Thu Jul 9 03:31:50 2015 UTC,"I personally feel like the digital manipulation is cheating. (Not that I actually do this; I just like the pics.) That said, there are a couple ones I didn't realize were digital initially that I really liked.   If I were going to go this route and had the cash to spend, I'd totally get the camera and a tilting / shifting lens. Something like this. ;)  I did use one for a single shoot in photo school, but I didn't understand it's power and simply took a picture of a tree. A detailed picture, to be sure. But knowing what I know now, I'd fin something high and tiltshift the hell out of something. That, or scheimpflug something just to say I scheimpfluged something."

tiltshift,3bphnb,Razzamafoo,11,Wed Jul 1 02:42:28 2015 UTC,"In short, no and slightly yes. Because it doesn't have interchangeable lenses, you can't use a tilt-shift lens, which means it won't shoot tilt shift at all. However, if you want to go the cheap route and use photoshop, then any higher resolution camera will be just fine.   These are real tilt-shift lenses btw: http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Camera-Lenses/Perspective-Control/index.page  If you want real tilt-shift on a budget, I would look for a decent used nikon or canon body, and buy a used tilt-shift lens. Nikon D300 can be had around 400 bucks, and a Rokinon T-S for about 600ish. The nice thing about that is that you can take off the T-S lens and use a nice portrait lens or telephoto.  Hope this helps. PM me if you have any other questions."
tiltshift,3bphnb,elwrigley,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:24:30 2015 UTC,"You're probably aware, but I'm betting OP comes from the tilt shift subreddit, where users have rather militantly redefined ""tilt-shift"" to describe a miniaturization effect which can't actually be done with tilt-shift lenses (usually applied to cityscapes where buildings break vertically out of the tilted plane of focus). The only way to achieve it in-camera would be to use a piece of film hundreds or thousands of feet tall and a lens the size of a house.  IMO, they may as well use a nice camera phone."
tiltshift,3bphnb,robshookphoto,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:57:06 2015 UTC,"To be fair, a TS lens CAN actually give you that effect (you just have to be really good at it). Especially with video. Here is an example that I like: https://vimeo.com/71736272 It isn't perfect, but you get the idea. Nothing done in analog (at the camera) will ever be as perfect as a Photoshopped image that someone has spent hours tweaking."
tiltshift,3bphnb,elwrigley,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:19:03 2015 UTC,"It can't do the effect I described. I know it can ""miniaturize"" - I shot these with a lens I made.  Look at the video you posted without pressing play. See how the tops of buildings are out of focus? Imagine it's actually a miniature and you're shooting it with a macro lens. The tops wouldn't be out of focus because they're the same distance away from the lens as the bottom. A tilt lens cannot do that, but photoshop can.

tiltshift,3ax3o8,Erotic_Abe_Lincoln,2,Wed Jun 24 19:58:13 2015 UTC,"I got to see it in person last year.    They had to build the goddamn museum around the thing.    It's made with a bunch of balsa wood to keep it light. Even still, it weighed a quarter of a million pounds. Here's a size comparison  If memory serves, the government helped Howard Hues partially fund it through a grant. As development went on and he realized that the design wouldn't be a viable way to carry lots of cargo across the atlantic, he knew that he still needed to prove the thing was ""flightworthy"" or he'd have to pay back the gov't funding.    (This is where wikipedia and the museum disagree, I'll sum one up and copy/paste the other.)    As the plane crept closer to an operational status, it was becoming clear that the engines (the epic Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major) would always be problematic. It took a team of engineers 8 hours of tinkering to bring them online and 6 hours to bring them offline. They had yet to get all 8 engines functioning at the same time.  During one of the many days of taxi tests, Hughes' was ecstatic to find that just before the final test of the day, his crew actually managed to get all 8 engines running. This happened to coincide with a a day where the press corps had been invited on board.     Hughes at the helm, he taxied the bastard out, let the engines idle for a bit to ensure they were actually playing nice-nice, brought the plane to speed on the water, and took off. He flew a single mile at 70 feet off the surface.    It never flew again. It was kept in working order for years. The project was scrapped after Hughes died.      Less exciting wiki version:     During a break in the Senate hearings, Hughes returned to California to run taxi tests on the H-4.[12] On November 2, 1947, the taxi tests began with Hughes at the controls. His crew included Dave Grant as copilot, two flight engineers, Don Smith and Joe Petrali, 16 mechanics, and two other flight crew. In addition, the H-4 carried seven invited guests from the press corps and an additional seven industry representatives. Thirty-six were on board.[18]  After the first two taxi runs, four reporters left to file stories, but the remaining press stayed for the final test run of the day.[19] After picking up speed on the channel facing Cabrillo Beach, the Hercules lifted off, remaining airborne at 70 ft (21 m) off the water at a speed of 135 miles per hour (217 km/h) for around a mile (1.6 km).[20] At this altitude, the aircraft still experienced ground effect.[21] Having proven to his detractors that Hughes' (by now unneeded) masterpiece was flight-worthy, thus vindicating the use of government funds,[22] the ""Spruce Goose"" never flew again. Its lifting capacity and ceiling were never tested. A full-time crew of 300 workers, all sworn to secrecy, maintained the aircraft in flying condition in a climate-controlled hangar. The crew was reduced to 50 workers in 1962, and then disbanded after Hughes' death in 1976.[23]        If you've never taken the chance to read up on Howard Hughes, now is the time. He is one of the most amazing characters the world had to offer during the 20th century. We can only imagine the great things he might have done had it not been for his most tragic and intriguing downfall."

You can actually see real focus blur in the image too. The subway sign on the building is blurred because of distance from the DOF and not because of a filter.  So, the subway sign in front would be either completely in focus or completely out of ficus since all parts of it are equal distance from the lens. And the ""lower""/closer part of out of focus area is usually softer and more gradual, while the OOF area further from you comes in faster and stronger"

The message about feeling aloof yet comfortable really describes why I fell in love with aerial and tilt shift photography.  I've been wondering about realtime tilt shift effects - for videos and even games - not sure why it isn't being used more often.  I expect this was done as a post production effect. They also sped up the video to maintain the illusion of it taking place in a miniature or diorama. Some of it even resembles stop motion video which shows a great attention to detail.

tiltshift,35rfvs,thenickdude,5,Wed May 13 04:36:03 2015 UTC,"Brenizer Method:       The Brenizer Method is a photographic technique developed by wedding photographer Ryan Brenizer. It allows for the creation of an image exhibiting a shallow depth of field in tandem with a wide angle of view by use of panoramic stitching techniques in portraiture. The combination of these characteristics enables a photographer to mimic the look of a large format photographic system with equipment that is generally more easily and cheaply available, such as a digital SLR or even a camera phone.  The method increases the effective sensor size of the camera, much like the larger negatives in medium and large format photography.

Really interested to learn more, I just shoot stuff on vacations and stuff, I'm not aspiring to be a professional photographer so I'm sorry for not knowing things"
tiltshift,35rfvs,memostothefuture,3,Wed May 13 18:57:26 2015 UTC,"First, Yes, the lens will work with your camera, but there are a few limitations, I'll get to those.   The Lens is the PC-E NIKKOR 24mm f/3.5D ED  First the limitations, You have to use A (aperture) or Manual Mode, and it will be Cropped 1.5x, so the lens is more of a 36mm.    The lens is the hardest lens I've used to get just right for shooting, but it's also my most rewarding lens.  I've gone on trips and it's been the only lens on my camera.    If you have an extra $2k, I'd highly recommend this lens.  I got this lens when I had the D7000 and it was amazing.  I've since moved to the D750 and the lens is even better in Full Frame."

It can be used to simulate shallow depth of field, or even large depth of field, but it does not authentically create it like a large aperture would.

tiltshift,356fwu,wollington,7,Thu May 7 15:49:00 2015 UTC,Tilt shift can do more than the miniature effect; in some composures can be used to increase the perceived depth of field by tilting and shifting the focal plane just right (while still maintaining a large aperture). This can be achieved with an actual tilt-shift lens (or focus stacking in software).
tiltshift,356fwu,DrubieDaGuru,1 point,Thu May 7 18:15:27 2015 UTC,"kool beanz bro. I didn't know that. That's cool that they have lenses that can do tilt shift as well. I know there are some cameras that do it in camera, but I never knew about the lenses."

tiltshift,356fwu,Skudworth,3,Thu May 7 18:30:30 2015 UTC,Well that's just cool. I didn't expect the lens to be like that. I thought that like the top and bottom margins of the lens would just be frosted instead of clear glass. Neat.

tiltshift,356fwu,DrubieDaGuru,1 point,Thu May 7 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"""In camera"" tilt-shift is usually just a fancy Gaussian blur mask applied after the photo is take and does not care about your composition. By hand, you can do a much better job adjusting the shape and magnitude of your masks. With a lens (admittedly expensive, see this Nikon mount 24mm f/3.5 tilt-shift lens is over 600 bucks) the physics takes care of focusing. It's actually really neat to experiment/play with!  I'll bookend this comment by noting I do appreciate even simple photographic effects when they're applied in well thought out ways (this does not apply to the overused classic Instagram filters)."

tiltshift,34qse2,jimdajam,1 point,Mon May 4 22:14:27 2015 UTC,"Tilt–shift photography:       Tilt–shift photography is the use of camera movements on small- and medium-format cameras, and sometimes specifically refers to the use of tilt for selective focus, often for simulating a miniature scene.  Sometimes the term is used when the large depth of field is simulated with digital post-processing; the name may derive from a perspective control lens (or tilt–shift lens) normally required when the effect is produced optically.  ""Tilt–shift"" encompasses two different types of movements: rotation of the lens plane relative to the image plane, called tilt, and movement of the lens parallel to the image plane, called shift.    Image i - Example for a creative photograph taken with a tilt-shift lens. The lens was shifted downwards to avoid perspective distortion: all vertical lines of the skyscrapers run parallel to the edges of the image. Tilting around the vertical axis resulted in a very small region in which objects appear sharp. (The depth of field is actually not reduced but tilted in reference to the image plane.)

tiltshift,33gzvn,miby,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:45:52 2015 UTC,Women and young girls were raped while this picture was probably taken. Families were separated. People forced to leave their homes...It's easy to sit and make mean comments when you don't know a thing about it. I didn't think I would ever be able to come back. Because they never showed a picture of my neighborhood on tv I assumed it was all gone. Turns out it wasn't but people were being shot on my streets for trying to deny the fact that people still thrive in bad situations!

The home of Monserrate Shirley was found to be the epicenter of the explosion. The explosion killed next door neighbors John ""Dion"" Longworth and his wife, Jennifer. Prosecutors allege that the natural gas explosion was intentionally set in order to collect insurance money. Shirley, along with four other men, have been charged with felony murder. Shirley's boyfriend, Mark Leonard, who also lived at the residence, has also been charged with conspiracy to commit murder after he allegedly attempted to hire a hitman to kill a key witness in the case.

If this is your first attempt and you're trying to get better at it, then I hope you will do well.   At the same time I am guessing you will want constructive criticism. There is one major problem with using an app (or not putting in the necessary effort)  On the left side the tree and the plant should either be completely in focus or completely out of focus. If they are not it ruins the picture. In this particular picture the plant should be completely out of focus and the tree should be in focus judging by how you chose the area that is in focus. If the app is any good, then you should be able to draw on areas that should be in/out of focus. I would love to see how the picture turns out if you change those two points.   No offense. Seriously."

tiltshift,32l2o2,kidinschool,3,Tue Apr 14 22:20:59 2015 UTC,Im one of those people:( what is the purpose/ end result of tilt shift?
tiltshift,32l2o2,jimdajim,3,Wed Apr 15 02:34:12 2015 UTC,"Tilt shift is not so much about a purpose or end result, it's really just a tool that can have a variety of different effects on what would other wise be a 'normal' photo.  A tiltshift lens is a normal lens that can 'tilt' or be 'slid' away from the body of the camera. Tilting will change the focusing distance across the image along the axis of the tilt, this can be used to simulate a miniature effect along with other possibilities. Shifting will alter the the angles of straight lines in an image (example photo, right side is shifted). Titlshift has become popular with the way it can make large objects look miniaturized but examples like above are not how tiltshift works. Tiltshift does not create a small depth of field like a large aperture would, but it can leave little of the photo in focus giving a similar effect. If the above photo were really tilted it the back ground behind the plane would also be in focus in a line across the image.  Not all tiltshift is miniaturization, and not all miniaturizations can be achieved through tiltshift."
