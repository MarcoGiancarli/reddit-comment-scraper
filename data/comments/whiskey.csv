It's a single malt that was aged for 22 years and finished in a Spanish wine barrel. I never knew whiskey could taste this awesome until I tried this.
whiskey,3e5kqn,whitetoken1,2,Wed Jul 22 03:13:28 2015 UTC,"Why is it a priority for you to enjoy whiskey? Sounds like spirits might not be your thing and there's nothing wrong with that.

Push through it. Drink a glass straight everyday for a couple weeks. After this the alcohol taste should be barely there, and you should taste all the finer qualities."
whiskey,3e3mcp,Lyrical_Myrical,10,Tue Jul 21 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"More often than not, distillers have to sacrifice some quality in order to reach mass production volumes. Plus, these mass-distillers marketed brands tend to produce products that target a very different customer from the boutique/artisanal distillers brands. Jack Daniels customers most likely aren't interested in sipping their whisky from a tulip-shaped glass and scribbling down tasting notes. They're more likely to order shots or mix it. On the other side, fans of Lagavulin won't be ordering shots of it which is why Lagavulin would be a pretty terrible shot.  It's like comparing Applebee's to Spago or some fancy restaurant in the city. Sure you could have a pretty good meal at Applebee's but there's a much better chance you'll get something nicer at a more boutique/craft restaurant. In the end, it's about which type of customer you are and what kind of experience you're seeking."
whiskey,3e3mcp,Razzafrachen,4,Tue Jul 21 18:41:35 2015 UTC,That's actually a really good answer and analogy. Thanks.
whiskey,3e3mcp,quercus_robur,2,Tue Jul 21 18:44:47 2015 UTC,"But it depends on the producer.  It's really more about price-point and choices made by the producer, not just production volume.  For example, in the U.S., the large producers generally make better products than any small-volume producers.  In general, I would say that Glenmorangie is better produced than several smaller distillers of scotch, however don't expect a $35 product to compete with a $60 product."

For $38 I can get a ~7-8yr Four Roses Single Barrel at 100 proof.    For $27 I can get Rittenhouse Rye Bottled-in-Bond at 100 proof.    For ~$50 I can get 9yr Knob Creek Single Barrel at 120 proof.  At those prices, those are better options for me than Jack Daniels.  Someone has to pay for all the billboards and international advertising in China and elsewhere, and that makes Jack Daniels over-priced for me."

whiskey,3e4g23,henskies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:59 2015 UTC,"Firstly, don't spend your $200 on one bottle up front. I'd start with a range of good entry-level options to figure out what you like. Better yet, go to a bar and just try stuff. Develop your ability to taste and distinguish flavors. Learn to tolerate burn so you can sip and enjoy fine whiskies without watering down the flavor.  There are literally hundreds of good options across bourbon, scotch, and other world whiskies in your price range. /r/scotch and /r/bourbon have helpful beginner's guides in their sidebar which I would check out."

whiskey,3e3fxo,quercus_robur,2,Tue Jul 21 17:55:09 2015 UTC,Most Irish whiskey isn't peated...  Which ones has your friend tried?  Malt whiskey will never taste like bourbon.  Has your friend tried Jameson?  I also agree with the Redbreast 12yr recommendation (although it doesn't have to be cask strength).
whiskey,3e3fxo,quercus_robur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"She loathes Jameson - she compares it to ""Licking Ireland itself."""
whiskey,3e3fxo,yeags,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:54 2015 UTC,"That's fine, but it has nothing to do with peat.  Irish or scotch whiskey will never be as sweet as bourbon due to bourbon being at least 51% corn and the distillation to a low alcohol content.  Then there's also the issue of casks--bourbon uses all new casks; most other whiskies use used casks, so the bourbon gets all the vanilla and oak directly from a fresh cask whereas other whiskies are only getting the leftovers.  Try Redbreast.  Otherwise there's no reason your friend has to like Irish whiskey."
whiskey,3e3fxo,Green_Bay_Guy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:50 2015 UTC,Tulamore Dew Phoenix or Yellow Spot are excellent Irish whiskies with tons of flavor. If they still don't like Irish whiskey after testing those then they don't like Irish whiskey.

Goes down well neat, on the rocks, or mixed with other whiskeys. However, I think it tastes the least like real honey. Mixing it 50:50 with Old No. 7 is great.  Jim Beam Honey - a nice alternative to JD's. Definitely more of a real honey flavor to it, but it didn't go down quite as smooth. I didn't try mixing it with other bourbons, but it was excellent mixed into iced tea.  Wild Turkey Honey - tastes the most like real honey. Great in small amounts, but less sure of it after a bit. However, it mixes really well with other whiskeys to add a really nice honey flavor to them without taking away their other qualities."

In my opinion, it's easier to use 750mL as the standard ""bottle"" unit, since it's much more common, and then calculate a per-bottle price for 1L and 1.75L bottles to see your discount over the standard bottle.  Yes, that's the same Elijah Craig.  I think it would do well."

whiskey,3dw8oi,jeffspicole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:25:15 2015 UTC,"As far as whiskey mixed drinks go, I usually go with Bulleit rye. The whiskey doesn't overwhelm the drink, but it also has a unique character to it that makes the drink more fun to experience.   Although I generally agree with you, it looks like OP is asking for a bourbon, so I'm not sure if the Bulleit Rye is best here.   If bourbon is the drink of choice, I would kinda check with the uncle to see his tastes, but a cheaper higher-proof quality bourbon is OGD 114. A lower proof good mixer would be your Bullet Bourbon or classic Buffalo Trace or Old Weller.   To give you another option though, and your from Albany so you may like the classic local tones of this, see about getting the Hudson bourbon. That could be a very good old fashioned."

I'll try Bulleit rye on my own though.  I mentioned above that I've had Hudson/Tuthilltown (I'm 99% sure they're the same thing) Four Grain bourbon before and really enjoyed it.  But to get the amount I'd need would be upwards of $100.  If I do end up getting it, it would just be one of the small bottles to drink straight, with a liter of something cheaper for mixing."
whiskey,3dw8oi,muskovitzj,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:03 2015 UTC,"I like OGD Bonded or 114 or Four Roses Small Batch. It really depends on how you make your old fashioned. A lot of the time, the bourbon gets swallowed up by the fruit and sweetness when you get one out which is why you would want a hearty bourbon to bring that flavor to the fore. If you're making a more traditional OF which is less sweet and doesn't have a bunch of muddled fruit in it, you could probably just use whatever your favorite bourbon is, provided it isn't rye (I'm not sure rye and sweet go together particularly well)"
whiskey,3dw8oi,fiveorphans,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:05:42 2015 UTC,"I make a more traditional version, just some sugar/water, bourbon, bitters, lemon twist.

In Canada it runs around $50 dollars a bottle and I can't recommend it highly enough if it is available in your area.

You might consider one of the better indie Port Charlottes or if you can get your hands on an Octomore 2.2, that one was exceptional.  I don't think there's any value to be had in the 3-400 range for Ardbeg or Port Ellen anymore. Perhaps a peated Benriach (one of the '84s?) might work."

whiskey,3d8aux,ilovescotch93,15,Tue Jul 14 07:59:38 2015 UTC,"A lot of them are made to be cheap and in bulk. They have that moonshine bitterness that just takes away your will to live. This is what a random guy at a bar will drink, because it's cheap. Once you taste a good single malt quality, you acknowledge that it's better, and think the reason must be blend vs single malt.  However, there are blends that are blended to a certain flavor, that you just don't get from a single malt. Not that familiar with American whiskeys, but Johnny Walker is a good example for Scottish ones. Red Label is stuff you put in coke, it's just swill on it's own. Black Label isn't all that much better, but Green Label is brilliant. It has a wave of flavors coming from four different tasting single malt whiskeys. Blue and Gold Labels are more expensive... it comes down to taste what you like, I prefer the Green Label over those.  All in all, I think it's a conclusion people come to because they drink bad blends and good single malts, and then just write off blends altogether."

There is plenty of young bourbon available in the world.  The bourbon used for blended whiskies was never destined for an older bourbon anyway.  When I can get real good bourbon for $15-20, $6 isn't cheap enough for me to drink poor quality spirits.  The grain ""neutral"" spirits aren't any more neutral than they are in cheap vodka--the combination of fusel oils and off-notes in poor quality bourbon make for a particularly horrible product for my tastes."

Their original mash bill for the bulleit bourbon would have been considered a rye at 68% rye, 28% corn 4 % barley, so it's not a surprise they gave the rye a try.  Tom Bulleit nailed it imo.  It sounds like you like bourbon.  Woodford reserve is one of my personal favorites (did a review on it recently https://youtu.be/iiznXpFN1f4 ), and since Bulleit does both bourbon AND rye well,I'd suggest giving it a try.

Huh?  All bourbons have to be at least 51% corn--that's the main defining requirement.   Tom Bulleit nailed it imo.   Bulleit is made by MGP--it's not Tom Bulleit's recipe.  Since the rye was already being made by MGP, it didn't take anything for Bulleit to ""try"" a rye other than dedicate the marketing budget.   since Bulleit does both bourbon AND rye    Yet, they make neither of them, just buy them from different producers, so the two share no relationship anyway.

whiskey,3d20f6,quercus_robur,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:01:35 2015 UTC,"As to the first point, I'm talking 1800s.    From wikipedia: The current recipe is substantially different from the original by Augustus Bulleit, which used about two-thirds rye and one-third corn in the mash bill (which would make it a rye whiskey rather than a bourbon using modern product labeling terminology).  I didn't know that third point.  Thanks for the info"
whiskey,3d20f6,TheWhiskeyDic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:20:52 2015 UTC,"Your numbers are still wrong.  The same wikipedia entry lists the mashbill as 68% corn, 28% rye, and 4% malt.  You've got them all flipped around.  Wikipedia is meaningless--I could edit that article now and it would likely take weeks or months before anyone caught it.  That article is also wrong about Bulleit bourbon being manufactured by Four Roses.    I would also take any story from Diageo with a large grain of salt.  Much of the misinformation taught at the Bulleit Experience and the history they show there is unsubstantiated or outright contradicted by known history, and was made up after the fact.  So who knows what Augustus Bulleit did--I certainly wouldn't buy it that we know his recipe."
whiskey,3d20f6,quercus_robur,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:23:55 2015 UTC,"Wow... bit of an oversight.  Thanks for pointing it out.  I've got a question for you then.  I have that review channel, but I don't want to get my facts wrong.  A lot of what I do to try to stand out is talk about the history of the brand.  Any resources you'd suggest that seem to be a bit more reliable?   For the most part, contacting the distilleries directly doesn't usually get a response.  Where did you get your info?"
whiskey,3d20f6,TheWhiskeyDic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:28:04 2015 UTC,"It's difficult.  Not your fault--most large brands' stories are manufactured legend.    Here is some information on Bulleit: http://chuckcowdery.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-bulleit-story.html  I don't know of a single reliable source.  Cowdery's books are decent, but much of the information has to be researched from sources in Kentucky--don't expect any of the brands to not outright lie, so they're useless, even when they have ""historians"".  Perhaps someone else here has some better ideas.  EDIT: I forgot to answer your question--I don't remember where I got my information.  I pick up bits here and there, but I'm more interested in the current products.  I don't pretend to be any expert on bourbon history.  There's a recent book out now, Bourbon Empire, that is getting good reviews.  That might be somewhere to start.  But I expect you'll have to do some of your own work to connect the history to modern products.  The distilleries lied just as much in the past, so older records are no guarantee of being true either.  Some history is just lost forever."

whiskey,3d20f6,quercus_robur,2,Mon Jul 13 01:43:27 2015 UTC,"I like your video and what you're going for.  A few comments (just FYI) on Woodford Reserve:   certainly don't under-estimate yourself--if you smell green apple, go with it. Don't look for validation in someone else's tasting notes. if you like the cinnamon, I would suggest you also try Maker's 46 and Larceny. Both have a hot cinnamon note for me. Depends if that's the type of cinnamon you meant. I would recommend you get yourself a tulip-shaped glass. Either a Glencairn or something similar. Your ""bourbon"" glass just looks like a rocks glass, and you're missing some aromas with it. I believe Woodford Reserve was launched around 1996. Not sure if that's what you meant by a newer brand. That is relatively new, but there should be plenty of press about Woodford Reserve out there (although you might not find many enthusiasts talking about it). I don't believe Woodford Reserve has a 7yr age statement on it. Don't confuse that with when the distillery tells you that it has an average age of 7 years. There are certainly barrels younger than 7 years dumped into each batch, and you can't call it a 7yr old bourbon unless they put it on the label. Don't believe that a majority of the Woodford Reserve in that bottle came off of those copper pot stills you see at the distillery!--a bulk of Woodford Reserve isn't made at the Labrot & Graham distillery, but is made elsewhere on a column still, just like Old Forester. The distillery intentionally misleads people on this point. All bourbons use the sour mash process. There's not a single one that doesn't. Woodford Reserve actually made a limited edition sweet mash several years ago and it was a disaster. You won't see anyone else trying that again anytime soon. The sour mash process is to acidify the mash, which keeps harmful bacteria from taking over the mash before the yeast can take hold. It's not to maintain the yeast strains--yeast mutates so quickly that the distilleries propagate their yeast regularly, separately, and have to replace it about every week or so. Most of the yeast in the backset is dead--the backset is purely for the acidification (hence ""sour"" mash process). Lastly, the yeast strains are proprietary, not patented.   Hope that helps! Looking forward to more videos of yours!"

Woodford was the most researched of the whiskeys I've reviewed so far... guess my research skills need a bit more questioning, and less trusting what the company says about it's own product.  As for the Glencairn glass, I saw some of those and considered getting them.  Then I found this http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/libbey-6-piece-whiskey-tasting-set/1043127535?skuId=43127535 which claims to be a six piece set of glasses shaped for specific kinds of whiskey.

whiskey,3d20f6,TheWhiskeyDic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:47:29 2015 UTC,"The glassware is less about what they say it's ""designed"" for, and more about the shape--you want something with a more closed top, like a tulip-shaped glass, that will concentrate the vapors and aromas.  Those Libby glasses look like variations on a rocks glass, which is too wide open.    I would recommend a Glencairn or similar.

whiskey,3d2oel,quercus_robur,3,Mon Jul 13 02:17:20 2015 UTC,"Well usually you can engage in conversation with the bartender and figure things like these out.  Also coming from the states you can see which ones you've never seen before, maybe not 100% exclusive but more rare to find in the states."
whiskey,3d2oel,quercus_robur,3,Mon Jul 13 02:40:22 2015 UTC,"Perhaps.  I have low expectations for the average bartender, especially when you're asking them for expertise of another country.  True, if OP knows the liquor store shelves well, it should be easier."

whiskey,3czzwb,actng,6,Sun Jul 12 09:15:05 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard of this.  The vomiting sounds more like overindulging.  Some people do have alcoholic flush, which will have redness but rarely raised hives.  However, it would be to all alcohol, not to just scotch and not to one level of Johnnie Walker vs another.  Hives does sound like an allergy.  It may have been to something else they had that night or even that the bartender touched previously.  Bar grills, glasses, shakers aren't exactly sterilized after each use.  I'd wager it was a food allergy.  I doubt it would be an allergic reaction to one vs the other.  Red Label and Black Label would have very similar ingredients and prep, with the black being aged longer.  They do use dye for coloring, it's possible they use a dye for the Red that your friend was allergic to?"
whiskey,3czzwb,meh4354,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:26:32 2015 UTC,"Alcohol flush reaction:       Alcohol flush reaction is a condition in which an individual develops flushes or blotches associated with erythema on the face, neck, shoulders, and, in some cases, the entire body after consuming alcoholic beverages. The reaction is the result of an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a metabolic byproduct of the catabolic metabolism of alcohol, and is caused by an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.  This syndrome has been associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer in those who drink.  It has also been associated with lower than average rates of alcoholism, possibly due to its association with adverse effects after drinking alcohol.   Because of the association with Asian ancestry, alcohol flush reaction has also been referred to by such informal names as Asian flush syndrome, Asian flush, and Asian glow.

whiskey,3czgmx,mrgregs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:22:49 2015 UTC,the recommended four roses single barrel is a very fruity and floral bottle of bourbon. It goes really well in mint juleps. On the spicier end of things there is bookers or wild turkey rare breed (if he doesn't like high proof) .On the more mello end you should be able to get a bottle of Blantons or eagle rare. The blantons comes in a nice box and bottle and feels fancy in the way that it makes a great gift. Of all the bourbon drinkers I have met not a single one dislikes Blantons so as you don't know I would recommend that.

There is a wide variety of whiskey.  Without knowing what he likes, it's very hard to give detailed suggestions.  Without knowing more, my two general suggestions would be:  For scotch, I would recommend Balvenie 12yr Doublewood.  Might cost you right around $50-55.  Scotch is imported, so it will almost always be more expensive.  For bourbon, I would recommend Four Roses Single Barrel for about $40."

whiskey,3cca50,stucknmove,4,Mon Jul 6 21:35:55 2015 UTC,"Good question!  I'm sure price is lower by just buying the barrel outright, but if each barrel holds around 50 gallons, and they lose about 2% per year to the angel's share from aging, then you'd have around 47 gallons left after 3 years.  If you divided that up in 750mL bottles and tried to buy it retail price, you'd have to buy 237 bottles in total (with a partially filled bottle left over for chuggin' straight out of the barrel) at around $55 bucks a piece.  Comes out at $13,035 total for the barrel, but again, that's bottled up and purchased separately.  I think I've seen full whiskey barrels go for a little under 10k."

whiskey,3cca50,dustlesswalnut,2,Wed Jul 8 00:25:42 2015 UTC,"Most similar would be Scotch aged in fresh oak barrels. Very different from bourbon.  MGP is an abbreviation for Midwestern Grain Products, a company which owns the old Seagram's distillery in Indiana. They produce a ton of bourbon and rye, but don't offer any for direct sale themselves, instead they sell their barrels to what are called NDPs, or non-distilling producers like Bulleit, High West, Willett, Smooth Ambler, Tincup, and many more.  There is nothing wrong with their bourbon, in fact much of it is fantastic, but the barrels chosen for Tincup aren't anything special. They also don't list the state of distillation on the label, which is against TTB regulations, and they've emblazoned the label and the bottle itself with Colorado, misleading their customers into believing it was distilled in CO when it was only bottled there."
whiskey,3cca50,dustlesswalnut,2,Wed Jul 8 00:49:53 2015 UTC,"Hey thank you for the super informative post. Do you find that Stranahans is peated/smoky? I would be interested if it draws some similarities with Highland Park, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, etc. I suspect it's probably more mellow than those. Damn, I need to look up some lists of NDPs."
whiskey,3cca50,raca,2,Wed Jul 8 00:58:44 2015 UTC,"Nope, their malt isn't peated at all. If you want an American whiskey with some great peat influence, check out High West Campfire. It's a blend of bourbon, rye, and peated Scotch whisky. It's not as peaty as Laphroaig or Ardbeg but it's really nice."
whiskey,3cca50,johnmal85,2,Wed Jul 8 01:03:15 2015 UTC,I'll probably pass on the Stranahans then. Thanks for your recommendation. You sure do know some stuff!

I have been looking for months and even talked to liquor store owners, without any luck.   Then u/Tkoo sent me a message saying he found some where he was and he'd ship me some as soon as I paid him online. Of course I was hesitant. I am new to Reddit and you don't just trust anyone you ""meet"" online. I took the plunge and sent him my payment and the 2 bottles arrived this morning! Oh happy day!

It's a pretty good list with many different styles and flavors represented, you may hate one and love another but it's impossible to know which will be which until you try them. Have fun!"

whiskey,3bz02q,Neversafeforlife,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:02:11 2015 UTC,"I like Lot 40 too, but, yeah, doesn't count as cheap as compared to OP's examples.  Lot 40 is also 100% rye, unlike the blended options above.  I realize it may be an unpopular opinion, but I don't like any of the cheap ones with added neutral spirits.  I know some Canadians who would agree.  Hence my opinion that I would switch to a bourbon at that point, if the cost was equivalently cheap.  Also not clear if OP is in Canada--if yes, perhaps Lot 40 and other options are cheaper than bourbon.  But in the U.S. I would rather be drinking Old Grand Dad Bonded for $20 at 100 proof instead of a blended Canadian whisky."

Canadian whiskey sucks, with very few exceptions.  The boom hasn't really taken hold in Canada yet, at least not where I am (Calgary). Theres a bit more action than there was, but nothing like the states is seeing. If/when it does, maybe we'll see some better whiskey.

whiskey,3bz02q,do-i-have-to,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:32:40 2015 UTC,"I think I read somewhere (wish I could remember where) that it's not neutral spirits added to Canadians like you see with cheap American blended whiskeys, but the closest thing to it - whisky distilled to a relatively high proof in a column still (like Scotch grain whisky) and blended with higher quality whiskeys to give it flavor. I've also read that the entirety is aged, unlike blends with neutral spirits.  I tend to agree with you, but I do get tired of bourbon after a while. Evan Williams is a pretty good go-to, but I need variation."
whiskey,3bz02q,quercus_robur,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:37:16 2015 UTC,"I think that's right.  I was over-simplifying.  It's not quite neutral spirits added...  But they're generally not aged for 12 years like Johnnie Walker Black 12yr either.  Thanks for your response.  Sure, I can understand appreciating a ""smooth"" canadian whisky.  They're not actually as horrible on an absolute scale--I was exaggerating.  But I just don't consider them in the same league as other world-class options, which is contrary to Davin's opinions."

It's an MGP rye, which are all over the market, but I like it since it's 95% rye mash (5% barley) so it has a strong rye flavor, not to mention that the MGP whiskeys are actually of good quality. Rittenhouse is another good rye from Heaven Hill.  On a side note, since we're speaking of antique cocktails, it puzzles me when I see people making Manhattans with bourbon. It's supposed to be a rye cocktail. That's akin to making a bloody mary with gin - it's just not the same thing."

whiskey,3btazc,tirdun,2,Thu Jul 2 11:51:29 2015 UTC,"My theory is that as long as your palate is fine enough to distinguish what parts you like about certain whiskeys and what parts you don't, mixing cheap whiskeys to form new and better flavors shouldn't be that difficult. For example, I like the spicy sweetness of Buffalo Trace, and the smokey wood flavors in Black Grouse, so I mix around 500 ml of each in my beautiful decanter that my SO got me, and I'm tellin ya...A neat mix after work is just the thing to make me go "" ahhhhhhhhhh """
whiskey,3btazc,lilsanch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:30:26 2015 UTC,Nice. I havent tried Black Grouse yet. I've got some Buffalo Trace. I'll pick up a bottle of Black Grouse and give it a shot. Thanks!
whiskey,3btazc,thedersy1,2,Fri Jul 3 02:07:22 2015 UTC,"I have an empty handle of Fiddy12 that I call the slop bucket and a bottle of cheap Islay I call ""the hammer"". The hammer is probably a young Lagav that lacks much character other than very medicinal peat. Taking the hammer to a cheap or overproduced whisky (too sherried, too bland, too whatever)  often brings about something tasty, something entertaining or something that's at least drinkable. The only downside is when I create something that's actually good that I know I can probably never reproduce."
whiskey,3btazc,PJHFortyTwo,2,Thu Jul 2 13:29:46 2015 UTC,"I threw some knob creek, woodford, and bulleit in together since I had a 1/3 bottle of each. It's my go to camping whiskey. Very good. There is a strong cinnamon note, and the boldness of the bulleit and knob creek are softened very nicely by the mellow nature of woodford."

Had a bottle of Glenmorangie 10 at home (which I did not care for, too sharp and hot) and I thought; Jameson = smooth but boring, Glenmorangie = sharp but flavorful. So I topped off my bottle of Jameson with 2oz of Glenmo' 10 and I gotta say it was quite the improvement."

whiskey,3bjypt,heyitserica,10,Mon Jun 29 20:59:48 2015 UTC,"Okay so, I originally posted about a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle I was chasing on Craigslist for $300 that I wanted to surprise my new fiance with, and after lots of really helpful advice I decided to scrap that plan.  &amp;nbsp;  With the $300 I had for the bottle I ended up getting the fiance a bottle of single run whiskey from one of New Jersey's first post-Prohibition distilleries, and then I could also afford to get him an immersion circulator, vacuum sealer (for the immersion circulator) and steaks/sides for dinner. We live about 10 minutes away, and I got him the fifth bottle of whiskey to be made (legally) since the Prohibition.   &amp;nbsp;  We're both big Prohibition history buffs, so it was pretty fun in that regard. The whiskey was distilled using beers from a local brewery, and aged in Applewood. Here's a close-up of the bottle. The fiance says he really tastes the apple, and this is something he can mix with, drink straight or put on ice. He's been on the hunt for cocktail recipes and having a lot of fun with both the blender and making up drinks, so I think I made the right choice.  &amp;nbsp;  Thanks to everyone on this sub for the help, you really saved me from spending way too much money on a novelty.   Edit: immersion circulator, not blender. Not fancy enough for these terms!"
whiskey,3bjypt,entropikone,2,Mon Jun 29 21:08:05 2015 UTC,Whoa that's crazy! do they distill the beer before hop edition or an already hopped beer?
whiskey,3bjypt,entropikone,3,Mon Jun 29 22:58:18 2015 UTC,After hopping- they also had an iPa version but I got him the saison version because I was told the hops/floral notes came through more

whiskey,3bjypt,WhatHappenedToLeeds,5,Tue Jun 30 02:24:03 2015 UTC,I think it's for Sous Vide. The immersion blender keeps the water at a constant temperature and circulates it. I think they're actually called immersion circulators.

whiskey,3bjypt,Alergic2Victory,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:38:27 2015 UTC,"So you have to put any product you're cooking in an immersion blender in some sort of sealed bag, or else it's just boiling in slightly warm water and all the flavors will disperse into the water. A ziplock bag can work, but if you get a bubble or air pocket the immersion blender won't cook that space as evenly as the other parts. Plus, when you vacuum seal something that has a sauce or marinade it also helps the marinade really penetrate the meat/veggie/whatever.  The things on the right were lobster macaroni and cheeses. They weren't very good but the steak was all that mattered anyway"
whiskey,3bjypt,Big_Amish,3,Tue Jun 30 13:25:24 2015 UTC,An immersion blender is literally a blender that you put into a pot of food. You bought an immersion circulator. (They look quite similar.)

A beautiful scottisch single malt to start of with is Dalwhinnie. The smoothness of the whiskey combined with the sweet and subtle taste makes it a really good intro whiskey. This was the first bottle I bought after recommendations, and I would like to recommend it to you as well."

whiskey,3bcchu,quercus_robur,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:43:33 2015 UTC,It was in a wine cooler at 55 degrees and brought outside to a humid 95 degree day. What's the proper temperature to store them at?

whiskey,3bcchu,ArgonNightmare,2,Sat Jun 27 22:32:57 2015 UTC,"I'll preface this by stating that the only hard and fast rule of drinking whisky is that you must drink it however you like it. That simple. I wanted to say that before saying this; if your intent is to delve a bit deeper into the world of whisky, then you should know that the preferred and recommended way to drink whisky to understand  its full potential is to:   Drink from a proper nosing glass (glencairn is the favorite around here) Drink it at room temperature (do not store it in the fridge or freezer) Drink it neat or with a teeny bit of water (amount varies between whiskies)   If you're looking to really get into it, I'd recommend that. If you find that you like your whisky better with ice or whatever, go for it, it's no one's place to tell you otherwise."

Certain maniacs take to that kind of scotch though so to each their own. It's basically on the furthest end of the scotch spectrum.
