Knoxville,3e0xjl,latics72,4,Tue Jul 21 02:47:08 2015 UTC,"If your staying at the Oliver, you will be within blocks of many of the newest restaurants and bars in Ktown.   Five Bar for low light ambiance, maybe a romantic dinner there, its two blocks from Oliver on Gay St.  Dive bar? Good luck finding one of those around that hotel. Everything around the Oliver is pretty much new or fixed up. I'd recommend going bar hoping or just walking this route to find a nice bar: around Market Sq, along Gay St and down Summit Dr to Central Ave which is called Old City.  The Oliver has a sweet tiny bar called The Library. It only seats about 35 people so there can be a short line or wait to get in, but it is very intimate. Not sure if you can access the bar at night from the Lobby, there is an entrance in the Alleyway next to the Oliver, look for the red light.  If you got a rental car maybe drive down Central to Happy Hollar, its a shitty little bar that people like. Also Central Flats and Taps is down there... I had a bad experience with a bartender there so I don't go to that one, but a lot of folks here like it."
Knoxville,3e0xjl,aacawe,4,Tue Jul 21 04:22:37 2015 UTC,"For breakfast/brunch I strongly recommend the Grill at Highlands Row. It's down Kingston Pike a bit, almost to Bearden, but never in my life have I had brunch as good as this place. If you're wanting to stay close to your hotel though, The French Market has pretty authentic crepes and is literally a block and a half from where you're staying."

Knoxville,3e0xjl,UncleDutch,3,Tue Jul 21 13:46:43 2015 UTC,"All within walking distance-  Dive bar: Marie's Old Town Tavern- About as dive-y as it gets. Cash only. $2 PBR. Karaoke. The clientele is mixed between old working class rednecks and hipsters.   Breakfast: Olibea- Exclusively breakfast. Great locally sourced ingredients.   Brunch or Dinner: Knox Mason- Farm to table. Modern twists on southern classics. Excellent cocktails, and the mimosas at brunch are delicious.  BBQ: Sweet P's- Just some really solid BBQ. Rotating selection of local drafts.  Lunch/Dinner: Stock and Barrel- Nothing fancy, just goddamn delicious burgers made from local ingredients, and an excellent bourbon selection.  Best bar that happens to be in your hotel- The Library. One of my favorite bars with arguably the best craft cocktails in town. Really cool take on a speakeasy.  Other places to hit up: Preservation Pub, Bistro at the Bijou, and Suttree's."

Knoxville,3dsgza,darth-later,8,Sun Jul 19 02:56:06 2015 UTC,"But as for actual advice, this only works if your a nerd like I am, but try to host parties based on doing something as opposed to just drinking.  Have a friend that cooks? Have a food competition where they teach how to make a basic dish and everyone tries to make one on their own.  Whatever your friends passions are, build your activities around them."
Knoxville,3dsgza,darth-later,3,Sun Jul 19 01:17:30 2015 UTC,"That sounds really cool actually but I don't know how many of my friends would like to do that, but it sounds cool to try. Our normal thing to do is go play soccer and drink afterwards as for a lot of us soccer is our passion lol"
Knoxville,3dsgza,M3rlino,4,Sun Jul 19 01:20:02 2015 UTC,"Whatever besides soccer that you guys care about is just waiting to be explored! It can get kind of weird when a group doesnt move as a unit, so try this.  Do what you normally do, and try to throw in a twist with a new game or a new activity. For example, in my friend group not everyone likes to cook. But we host potlucks where you can cook, bring food, pay, or just enjoy the rest of the party. Its critical to make sure that what the group normally likes to do is constantly there in case individuals grow bored of the new thing.  So plan on playing soccer or seeing a movie, but brainstorm with at least part of the group on a small change for the first night. Have a story telling party where you write down a few topics on some index cards and have people tell stories based on what card they draw! Try whatever you want! Just make sure that if anyone feels like theyd rather go back to the usual routine that they can easily do that without throwing everyone off.  So if you did the story idea, make sure everyone who wants to be drinking is during the stories, that way people dont feel alienated or like things are changing without their consultation. The core dna of why you guys are together isnt going to change, so keep the nucleus of the routine intact.  And please be safe with the drinking! Ive had to help quite a few people this last year who took it too far."

Knoxville,3dqqkf,cfj1992,3,Sat Jul 18 17:45:56 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad zoo, the animals are healthy and it's clean, but many of the exhibits are pretty small. I do believe they are in the process of rectifying some of that though. A membership is a pretty good deal."
Knoxville,3dqqkf,cfj1992,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:24:17 2015 UTC,I go each summer and enjoy it. The kids enjoy the splash pad. In fact I think it's my sons favorite zoo. We go to this one and the sc and nc ones.  I especially like the elephant exhibit because it's closer up to them unlike the NC zoo

Knoxville,3dmoiq,sitman,2,Sat Jul 18 13:56:45 2015 UTC,This. I was discussing this with my wife. Knoxville was the site of the first civilian uprising during the Civil War.....and it was against the confederates.
Knoxville,3dmoiq,OriginalDavid,13,Sat Jul 18 01:54:16 2015 UTC,"I think the worst thing imaginable for any demonstration or protest would be for everyone to ignore them. Unless you're just looking for a fight, then go for it."
Knoxville,3dmoiq,MindVirusMedic,7,Fri Jul 17 14:51:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with this statement. If we don't pay attention to it, give it any kind of media attention, then the only people who will care it happened are the one's who showed up to the rally. Knoxville seems like the kind of place where this stuff happens all the time, but no one makes a big deal out of it, because that always seems to escalate the problem rather than solve it. If something can be done to solve the problem rather than cause a scene, do it, by all means, but don't assume everyone is an activist. A lot of us want to have opinions, and allow others to have opinions, privately."
Knoxville,3dmoiq,berrie88,4,Fri Jul 17 16:06:46 2015 UTC,Yep. Conversations and trying to understand each other (whether you think they are right or wrong) will accomplish more than any protests.  Arguing back only makes the other side dig in their heels on their opinions anyways.
Knoxville,3dmoiq,MindVirusMedic,-2,Fri Jul 17 16:32:33 2015 UTC,"I understand your point and used to think the same way, but tend to disagree with it now.  I think it's important to make sure there is a vocal and recognizable counter argument to public displays. It's not so much about changing the person's mind that you're disagreeing with (because that can be almost impossible) but to influence those watching from afar.  The idea of controlling the narrative is a powerful one. When only one side has a say, they control how the facts are framed. If this went off without a hitch, people will notice. Do you want Knoxville to be viewed as that kind of town? I don't."
Knoxville,3dmoiq,berrie88,6,Fri Jul 17 17:10:05 2015 UTC,"I think the main word in there is control. Everyone wants control. This is why our prison population is so ridiculous. Control the population, control everyone's actions and opinions, control how everyone sees the world.  Listen, I went to a liberal arts college, I got an fancy degree, and I used to be on the side of actively attempting to try to get people to see the good in people through all of their hatred, and the problem is it is thought control. People have opinions, we have the right to have opinions.  This bologna about the flag is just a distraction from the real problems with our government in the first place. Do not allow them to distract you from what is actually important."
Knoxville,3dmoiq,berrie88,0,Fri Jul 17 17:40:02 2015 UTC,Are we disagreeing? I say I'm against this rally and would like to publicly say so. Are you saying I shouldn't voice this opinion?  I won't get into the fallacy that caring about this means I don't care about other things.
Knoxville,3dmoiq,MindVirusMedic,5,Fri Jul 17 18:31:03 2015 UTC,You have the right to do what ever you want to do. That is the beauty of this country. I just think it is a waste of time and a distraction from the actual problem.

If it makes you feel better keep it with you, but I'd keep it as a last resort only if a bear is acting aggressively.  Normal bear procedure of not running away, being loud, making yourself big, and slowly backing away should be adequate for you unless you are very unlucky.    edit:  I can totally understand why you'd be more nervous hiking with a toddler.  Small and more easily scared they're less likely to listen to directions that could prevent a bear attack."

Knoxville,3dh04g,allthebacon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:28:51 2015 UTC,For a serious answer: I've hiked in the smokies my entire life and have encountered bears only a few times. It's scary but they have never bothered me. If I were hiking with my daughter Id be more nervous but usually you are fine as long as you don't sneak up on them. Having a toddler is prob as good as a bear bell. Bear mace is a lot of weight for something that prob won't work.  Reminds me of a joke: how do you find bears? By finding bear scat. How do you know which is bear scat? It smells like pepper and has tiny bells in it lol. Good luck man and I wouldn't worry about it too much. Especially if you aren't in the smokies back country.

Knoxville,3dh04g,treefuzz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:14:28 2015 UTC,Historically black bears lived throughout Tennessee and the southeast.  Many years ago they were hunted out except for places like the smokies.  Their population has grown tremendously over the past decade due to the TWRA limiting hunting opportunities.  There are now more opportunities to harvest a black bear because of their repopulation success.  Even in Knox county!  I image in the next decade bears will be common place around here. After all...they were here first.

Knoxville,3dh04g,MatthewG141,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:35:39 2015 UTC,"Realistically you would have to fuck up in some way for a bear to be a threat to you. Unless you're on some very back country trails, it is extremely rare during the summer in the Smokies to be far away from other people. The park has done a great job over the last few decades educating people to not bother or feed bears, and as a result the current generation is much more human-shy than they used to be. You still might see one off the trail occasionally, but I hike very frequently, and rarely even see scat, let alone the bears themselves. I never carry bear mace, normally hike alone, and I've always felt totally safe down here.  If you were out and about in more wilderness-y areas somewhere West you might want to take some precautions, but it's just not much of an issue here when day-hiking."

It's worth going for the history lesson alone.  There's also some good spots to go by yourself that ARE pretty spooky if that's what you're looking for.  First, I'd recommend Old Grey Cemetery on Broadway, near Central.  Go at night, but be away that you could be considered trespassing.  However, nobody's ever bothered me, even driving through with my headlights on.  Also, it's a bit of a drive, but go to Look Rock in Tallassee, off Foothills Parkway.  It's about 15-20 minutes south of Maryville.  Take hwy 321 towards Townsend, then turn right onto Foothills Parkway.  Go 11 miles.  Look for a sign that says ""Tower Trail"" or ""Look Rock"".  Park there, walk up trail.  It's about a half-mile walk through the woods at night, and it's spooky as shit, but when you get to the top you have an awesome view of the surrounding area, and can see Knoxville on the horizon."

Knoxville,3cw7iq,Craigstermccraig,2,Sat Jul 11 08:00:52 2015 UTC,"I've been renting from them for over a year now at their Fort Sanders Manor property. They're alright. They're very old-fashioned as far as communication goes. No-email, no e-payments. The upside to that is that because I have to pay in-person, I've gotten to know them better (and to their credit, they're good about remembering names and a little bit about their tenants). In terms of the properties, I can only speak to FSM. It's old as hell (100+ years) and you really do have to dust every other day as a result. Maintenance can take awhile to come if you have a problem, so sometimes you have to call a second time to make sure they come in a timely matter. I wish they didn't allow smoking in the building, but luckily my immediate neighbors don't smoke. Overall, it is decent for the price (especially considering they don't charge for utilities) and they really don't tolerate funny business from tenants (i.e. heavy partiers, drug users) which is great. I don't plan on living here permanently though (just another year) and I can't imagine any of their properties (if they're like FSM) would be places all but the most cash-strapped people would want to live long-term."

Knoxville,3cw7iq,jbrown199008,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:25:33 2015 UTC,"I rented a one bedroom apartment from them at Kingston Manor.  It's an older building.  I think it was built in the 1920s.  I loved it.  It was big, sunny, and in walking distance to the Bearden Beer Market (the best part!).  The apartments there have no dishwashers and no washer and dryer units, including no hookups.  You'd have to do laundry offsite.  Those things weren't deal breakers for me, though.  The rent price was excellent, and I didn't have to pay extra for water.  That's something I've run into a lot in Knoxville.  They do a great job with pest control, but maintenance can definitely be slow.  You might have to call a couple of times to get something fixed, but the worst thing I encountered was a leaky toilet.  I don't know how emergency maintenance is.  I'm sure it's much quicker since the emergency number is Bob Monday's actual cell phone.  Also, the complex was very quiet with great neighbors.  It felt very much like a mini community.  I'd suggest taking a look at Kingston Manor if some of the things I've mentioned aren't deal breakers for you, and if you're interested in living in Bearden."

Knoxville,3cm3vn,Inclement_Weathers,8,Thu Jul 9 14:16:05 2015 UTC,"I've had the police called on me twice for leaving my dogs in the car. Both times there were absurd confrontations with hysterically upset women and (thankfully) calm police officers.  Both times it was after dark, cool, and/or raining. Both times I was literally running into a store for fewer than 5 minutes. I don't often leave my dogs in the car, but when I do, I always crack the windows (except when  raining, of course). You see, the problem is that one of my dogs--a fluffy adorable and dramatic labradoodle--has an emotive face and will yelp and whimper as though he's being tortured the exact moment my back turns to walk away from the vehicle. I can understand why someone would hear and see him and believe he's dying. My other dog (RIP) was always as cool as a cucumber. He loved the car; especially stealing my drivers seat and pawing the horn when he saw me coming back. Man I miss that guy.  Now, I park at the far side of parking lots where my dog can express himself out of eye/earshot and I take a photo or a short video as I leave (for the time stamp proof). I find this a ridiculous situation, but I haven't had another incident and my dog is as loud and obnoxious as ever.   So, I was glad to see:   Specific steps, including searching for the owner and notifying law enforcement, must be taken to qualify for protection under the law.   I'll probably still continue to park far away from store entrances though. Crazy people."
Knoxville,3cm3vn,veringer,2,Thu Jul 9 04:21:37 2015 UTC,"Lol! I have a dramatic labradoodle too! She's actually really calm and patient in my truck though, thank god. I have tinted windows and that really helps with the ""concerned citizen brigade"".  That said, I take her everywhere with me, she's the best truck dog. But I leave her at home if the temp is above 80 degrees. She's such a drama queen, it's hard to do. The dramatic sighs, the moping, the pouting, the groans...  All I know is if for some reason I'm detained and she's in serious trouble, then please! Break into my truck and rescue my dog! But she better damn well be lethargic and panting before some stranger takes that drastic step. If she's bouncing around, barking, and smiling, I'd be madder than a hornet if I came out of the grocery to find a brigade of hysterical bystanders standing next to my damaged vehicle and my joyful, excited, perfectly fine Doodlebug loving all the attention. So I was glad to see they have to at least try to find me and call a cop first.  How many hysterical women are actually going to pay attention to that caveat? All they're going to hear is ""Distressed dog? Break in! It's legal!"""
Knoxville,3cm3vn,erhatfield,2,Thu Jul 9 13:12:33 2015 UTC,"I had a similar situation, but with a cat (I was in the process of moving to another state, I don't typically carry my cat around with me, hah!). I'd left him in the car for 5 minutes max while I ran inside Publix to get a cashier's check so I could put a deposit down on an apartment, and some women was seriously about to break my window, saying my cat was in distress. I let her feel the air in my car (cool, of course) to calm her down so I could leave without her reporting me.  Seriously, I'm all for breaking windows to save animals, but just use some sense and give the owner a couple minutes."

Knoxville,3cm3vn,veringer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:40:59 2015 UTC,"It remains to be seen if this will be ""done well"", but, as written, I don't think this is a crazy policy. For one thing, it's following 16 other states with similar laws. And, moreover, it seems to be coming from a pretty empathetic and forward-thinking perspective. This is coming from a person who's been on the receiving end of the crazy stick when it comes to dogs in cars."
Knoxville,3cm3vn,veringer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:41:19 2015 UTC,"To be protected by this law you need to first actively attempt to locate the owner and secondly call the police before breaking a window. I too worry that the average Samaritan won't follow these preliminary steps.   I would be inclined to draw my weapon in fear I was being robbed.    It's an interesting scenario you bring up, but I'd put the likelihood of justifiable ""self defense"" pretty low in this case. Shooting a suspected car thief would probably not be a defensible action in most cases. I don't think the castle doctrine extends to an unoccupied car. That said, I'm not sure how you can simultaneously criticize vigilantes while, in the same breath, threatening to engage in vigilantism. If I saw someone breaking into my car, even if I had a gun handy, I'd avoid confrontation. Of course, my 80 pound (presumably) agitated dog would potentially complicate the situation, but I'm a little miffed at your apparent cavalier attitude."

Knoxville,3ck7fj,UncleDutch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:01:06 2015 UTC,It looks like it's a short-range Uber in off-road golf carts.
Knoxville,3ck7fj,CleverTiger,2,Wed Jul 8 19:31:45 2015 UTC,"so is this like Uber, or.."
Knoxville,3ck7fj,kevan0317,3,Wed Jul 8 17:22:07 2015 UTC,Yeah.  Looks like they're short range but I kinda like the idea of groups rolling together.  Boozing around the Old City and Market Square in a group and not having to always walk would be cool.  I bet this will really take off once Cumberland doesn't look like a bum's least-favorite cardboard box.  Start on The Strip.  Take these guys to Market Square.  Take these guys to the Old City.  Take Uber home.

Knoxville,3cjd07,DisneyMeowMeow,4,Wed Jul 8 20:10:06 2015 UTC,"Thursday night - Sassy Anns for dancing. Best place hands down for that. It's in an old house that's been converted to bar with a dancing area. They pour really heavy so that's a plus! Beer, drinks, and food - Stock and Barrel - We also have a hidden bar-ish place called the Peter Kern Library. It was originally built as a speakeasy back in the day and it is amazing! All original drinks that are so tasty. It's really small with limited capacity so get there early if you're going at night. It's in the side alley beside The Oliver Hotel. There's no signage just a single red light marking its entrance! After, you can skip over to the Casual Pint right next door!"

I did end up getting a beer at Suttree's at the end of the night, which was a great nightcap."

Knoxville,3cjd07,JCougar,2,Wed Jul 8 20:21:23 2015 UTC,You want something memorable... take a trip down Magnolia and eat all things SYSCO at Chandler's Deli!  /s    Hit up Rankin's at Quincy & Central for a delicious cheap old-school diner breakfast.  Breakfast is around 6 bucks and the place is a Knoxville staple.   FYI They are only open Tue-Sat and close from 6AM-2PM.
Knoxville,3cjd07,justy98,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:02:11 2015 UTC,"suttree's tavern is great for high gravity beer, food wise there is a plethera to choose from. Burgers, downtown at least I'd go to stock and barrel. It's a pricey burger and whiskey bar but damn good, plus the confit french fries are delicious. Soccer taco has a good authentic mexican menu. Sweet P's bbq has a joint downtown called the downtown dive- great wings and bbq. For brunch I'd recommend bistro by the bijou, plaid apron or I've heard knox mason is good but we haven't been ourselves. There's also the French Market creperie and for dessert get some delicious gelato from coolato gelato, they also make great espresso drinks. I would also second checking out the saturday morning farmers market- lots of food trucks and delicious baked goods to get. Other beer joints to check out would be casual pint- they have a few locations around the knoxville area, and bearden beer market- an outdoor beer market where you can play some games and just relax outside with a beer."

Knoxville,3cjd07,kahlualua,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:52:01 2015 UTC,"my favorite restaurant in knoxville is the stock and barrel. It's basically hamburgers and bourbon (hence the name). Great bourbons at good prices (burgers cost more than most burger joints, but it's high quality, local foods). The food is awesome. Nothing like eating food that was killed nearby.   As for beer. I'd recommend Central Flats and Taps. They have great beer (good selection of craft beers) and the food is really good too. The menu is limited to stuff with flat bread (pizza, sandwiches, etc), but every item on the menu (and I've tried nearly all of them) is really really good!  As for entertainment, I'd rather be outside than anything, so I'd recommend Ijam's if you can't make it out to the mountains. Have fun!"

Knoxville,3cgwkz,swibirun,6,Tue Jul 7 23:36:53 2015 UTC,Full Service gets my vote for best BBQ.
Knoxville,3cgwkz,swolfe2,3,Wed Jul 8 00:10:32 2015 UTC,I went to the one in Maryville. No complaints.
Knoxville,3cgwkz,rdl2k9,3,Wed Jul 8 00:02:13 2015 UTC,I have probably gained 5 lbs since they opened on Merchants. Those bbq nachos are where its at.
Knoxville,3cgwkz,Weed-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"M&M before Archers? M&M has it's place, big portions and cheap, but not great by any means. At least in my opinion. I keep forgetting to try full service."
Knoxville,3cgwkz,MuchLu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:10:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly I need to try Archer's more.  Only tried them twice at their Farragut location (been a while) and it was okay, just not impressed enough to keep coming back.  Need to give them another try because like I said, everyone has bad/good days."
Knoxville,3cgwkz,swibirun,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:45:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd choose M&Ms above any of the others listed. Way better flavor in my opinion, even without sauce."
Knoxville,3cgwkz,knoxjl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:31:52 2015 UTC,"I just now tried full service for the first time. I can only speak for the pulled pork, potato salad and banana pudding. The pulled pork is great and I'll go back just for that. The macaroni was very chalky and I didn't like it at all. And I hate to say it but the potato salad wasn't great either. It was very bland. The banana pudding seemed over saturated with artificial banana flavoring. With that being said, I loved that pulled pork and the sweet and spicy sauce. I really liked the tennessee whisky as well. I'll definitely be going back to try the other meats and other sides.  I love Archer's potato salad, it's very creamy with chives. They're banana pudding is really good, too."
Knoxville,3cgwkz,MuchLu,5,Wed Jul 8 23:22:29 2015 UTC,"I would like to give two votes, one for sweet p's and one for full service bbq. Full service has amazing everything, but sweet p's has the best freaking wings."
Knoxville,3cgwkz,kahlualua,5,Wed Jul 8 00:10:43 2015 UTC,Best coffee: 1. Old city java 2. Flow (on Main) 3. Tied between K-brew (on Broadway) or coffee & chocolate (Market Square)

That being said, I'm pretty sure either Dead End or Sweet P's will win out, and out of those 2 I choose Sweet P's.   I'm not sure how this is supposed to work. Am I supposed to offer up a category now? If so, I'll choose this:  Best spot to get a beer? (for me, Suttree's)"

Knoxville,3cgwkz,saricher,2,Wed Jul 8 03:01:51 2015 UTC,"Best cheap breakfast diner: Amber's off of Maynardville Pike. Breakfast for 2 people, including coffee, 2 eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy (or biscuit and grits)  is $11 and change. Cash only. Only open until 2pm.

Knoxville,3cgwkz,NumberMuncher,2,Wed Jul 8 04:23:36 2015 UTC,I'll second the Casual Pint (at least the locations at Northshore and Papermill).  Every time I go in the staff is super friendly and they have a broad selection.
Knoxville,3cgwkz,vanburen1845,4,Fri Jul 10 01:09:41 2015 UTC,Best burger would be stock and barrel for me. Also best mexican which for me is soccer taco.

Knoxville,3cgwkz,_something_clever,2,Wed Jul 8 18:27:35 2015 UTC,Soccer Taco is as Mexican as Pizza Hut is gourmet Italian.  El Girasol or La Esperanza for Mexican.
Knoxville,3cgwkz,JMFormont,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:10:41 2015 UTC,"That's really harsh. When a lot of people are looking for ""Mexican"" a lot of the time they are looking for americanized Tex mex type stuff with avaliable large margaritas. Have you ever had the stuff on the more authentic section of the menu like the tongue tacos? Those are amazing. Not everyone wants the same thing in their mexican restaurant."
Knoxville,3cgwkz,rdl2k9,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:05:38 2015 UTC,"Vitriolic and harsh- certainly. I didn't quite mean use such a hyberbole but hey- 8 am at work.   Soccer Taco's authentic menu is alright- but never recommended by their servers! I just find it sad that in a country or region (South) where authentic Mexican is of higher quality, cheaper and readily available that we do not call Soccer Tacos for what they are- Tex-Mex."
Knoxville,3cgwkz,saricher,2,Fri Jul 10 13:11:13 2015 UTC,"For Thai it would have to be Surin or Tast of Thai. I personally favor Surin, but Taste Thai is my number two.   If you are looking for classic American Chinese (that you can get take out style) I really like China Lee.   Best Nature spot is hard... I think I would need more specifics before picking something like that. Knoxville has a lot of nature.   Best Venue for what?  I only know one Indian place and that is Sitar."
Knoxville,3cgwkz,tastycakes147,2,Wed Jul 8 03:17:59 2015 UTC,I love Surin!

Knoxville,3cgbrv,FlizmFlazm,2,Tue Jul 7 18:42:00 2015 UTC,"I doubt there's any way of knowing this, there are just too many unknown factors; there are several new developments happening in the area, all of which are going to take a few years: new bike park, new apartments at Baptist Hospital, this new river park and river walkway, new features opening at Ijams... etc. I doubt the work on Cumberland will affect South Knox in any significant way. In the meantime, everything is torn up over here in preparation for it, so it's probably not super easy renting right now. Eventually, rent will probably go up (as it will anyway, because Knoxville is becoming more and more popular), but will it be like West Knox? Maybe not (although the college apartments are already as expensive as West Knox apartments), but who knows, with the rise in popularity of outdoorsy stuff in Knoxville these days. I have heard, though, that the apartments in the old Baptist Hospital are supposed to be ""affordable living spaces,"" which I've been told means reasonable rent for young people... grad students or recent grads."

If you like Turkish, there is Turkish Quality Market in the West Town Mall area. It's a small store with a cafe area in the front and they serve fresh made doner, hummus, babaganoush, tabbouleh, etc. The place is nothing fancy, but the food is excellent and the family running it are very kind, sweet people."

They have a buffet during lunch on the weekends and also a full menu. This has been my only experience with Middle Eastern food but I have to say their food is very good and the buffet is well worth the price.

We just started season 2, so we're on episode 9, or 10 if you count the pilot as #1.

Knoxville,3cblga,mcsane,6,Mon Jul 6 17:17:26 2015 UTC,Knoxville has an urban sprawl issue. What are your interests? Will help narrow down apartment locations.
Knoxville,3cblga,B00YAY,3,Mon Jul 6 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"The landings by the river are a great apartment complex, probably the best downtown for the price. But you should know there are a lot of college students there so that's something to think about. Most any apartment complex downtown is going to have a lot of students. If you aren't into living in a building with students you'll want to look outside of the downtown area."
Knoxville,3cblga,somethingfabulouss,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:40:23 2015 UTC,"This is true for Sterchi Lofts, but other lofts in downtown proper tend to be out of the price range of students. There are lots of buildings downtown without students - Sterchi Oaks and the Lucerne building on 5th Ave tend to have young professionals. Buildings with lofts for rent by owner seem to also be largely student-free."
Knoxville,3cblga,ImNotSara,2,Mon Jul 6 18:45:31 2015 UTC,I live at Wellsley Park. Very expensive but one of the nicest places in Knoxville. The staff and maintenance are also very nice.
Knoxville,3cblga,jeneexo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:39:03 2015 UTC,"There's alot of nice places in the Bearden area, just west of downtown. I like this area cause it's a little calmer, less expensive, still has plenty of bars and restaurants,  and you can get downtown in about 5 mins.   I've lived in West Towne Manor for 4 years and just renewed my lease again. I've heard people on here give it a bad rap, but I feel like I can't beat the price given the square footage, layout, location, complex, etc. But there are many other nice complexes right around this area."

Knoxville,3cblga,heybookworm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:03:05 2015 UTC,"I hated it, personally. We had numerous maintenance issues while we lived there, and the maintenance staff was grouchy and not helpful. It always felt like they just wanted to ""quick fix"" instead of actually solving the problem.  And, as u/positivelySlime said, there have been a number of fires at Copper Pointe over the past few years.  The only positive I can say for them is that their office staff is very friendly/helpful...but that wasn't enough to outweigh all the cons. We signed a lease there in a hurry without doing much research, but if you look into it, you can do WAY better for the cost...and in the same area. After our year-long lease was up, we found a place nearby that we liked much better and moved."
Knoxville,3cblga,luckylee423,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:59:22 2015 UTC,"Country Oaks is just down the road. That's the only one I can give to a recommendation about. I have a few buddies that have lived there in the past. It was nice, but I still like my place way better. Also, if you happen to be of an Asian nationality you might enjoy my complex. For some reason like 70% of the tenants are from various Asian countries. (My hallway smells amazing every day) PM me if you think you might take a tour, I'll give you my name to put me down as you refence and we can split the referral money if you do move here.  To be honest you should check out http://knoxvilleapartmentguide.com/ and look in the West or North areas. (West is better) Probably not worth looking in east or south. I'm sure there are some diamonds in the rough, but there's also alot of rough.  Also, I work for a business technology company. We can probably help make your company's move and transition a little easier if you need some help. We help with that kind of thing all the time. Just let me know."

I looked at them recently on apartmentratings.com or whatever that website is and they moved someone into the apartment like 5 months after we left and they still hadn't fixed the issue. Reckless ass people. I had no idea what a brown recluse spider looked like until I moved there. Now I'm an expert.
Knoxville,3cblga,pandaham,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:09:51 2015 UTC,"I broke my lease at the Landings after 6 months because it flooded 3 times, and I was sick of paying $900 a month for a 600 square foot apartment with half a closet. It was full of students and it felt like every single person had a giant untrained dog that they let off leash in the parking lot. I hated that place so damn much. But others love it. YMMV.   Honestly, the rental market in Knoxville is hugely overpriced in general. I now rent from a private owner -- seriously, I highly recommend it. Peruse Craigslist and check out the downtown lofts, townhomes in West Knox or even houses in North Knox--there are plenty.   Also, if you have the means to buy and plan to stay here for a while, DO IT. Way more bang for your buck and the real estate market is at a really good balance here right now."

Knoxville,3cblga,veetack,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:20:36 2015 UTC,"I've lived at the Landings and at Northshore Woods in Rocky Hill. Of those two, I'd choose Northshore Woods. Both have pretty screwed up property management issues. In the 6 months I lived at the Landings, they went through 3 different property managers. I have a friend that lives there now, and she loves it. Northshore Woods has been having an exodus of good employees more recently.   Price was an issue for me. We paid $1000 for a way too small place at the landings, and it had a lot of issues with noise, AC not working, and basically shoddy building. Northshore was much bigger, had a TON of closet space, and was only 595 a month. Noise was still an issue for some, but nothing intolerable. A lot more postgrad types there, where the landings was all UT students when I was there (I lived directly below Tyler Bray. Explains a lot of the noise).   This is what I can give you input on, hope it helps."
Knoxville,3cblga,_something_clever,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:17:21 2015 UTC,What are you looking for in a house/apartment?  What type of neighborhood do you like? What side of town would you be working on? What is your preferred rent range?
Knoxville,3cblga,_something_clever,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:05:10 2015 UTC,"I would be working in either the BB&T/TN Tower, not exactly sure what side of town would be best but my preferred rent range would be anywhere from 1,000-1,200."
Knoxville,3cblga,PetulantVol,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:29:57 2015 UTC,"If you are working downtown I recommend, for houses, 4th and Gill or Old Historic North districts (renting or buying). The area is only 2-3 miles from downtown. The houses are all around 100 years old, but a lot of them have been updated, and the neighborhoods are lovely. Usually places in Old North rent for $800 - $1,000 (for a two bedroom house)  If you want apartments or city condos, the closest you can get are downtown lofts. Those are pricier, probably ~$1,200/month rent for most, but they are pretty nice if you like the city/apartment life feel. You could walk to work, and a lot of really good restaurants. There are also good entertainment venues and shops in walking distance, as well as a movie theater. They also are building a lot of new condos down there that may be available for purchase.  If you want to get a little further away from downtown, I really enjoyed the springs meadow apartments (about 15 min drive from downtown). They are well below your rent range, ~$750-850 for a two bed two bath. The complex in nice, and pretty quiet.   Personally, I like to live near down town, or east of down town. The little bit of traffic that knoxville has is concentrated to the west of the UT campus/downtown area where you would be working. Then again, there are more stores and shopping to the west, so it really depends on what you like."
Knoxville,3cblga,_something_clever,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:57:59 2015 UTC,Stay far away from Sutherland Park and the other two complexes near it. We used to live there and it's nothing but ghetto trash. They look nice until you notice the drugs and such after dark and on weekends.
Knoxville,3cblga,_something_clever,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:16:15 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I already commented about housing, but I just noticed you wanted info about Knoxville too.   If you like eating out, you have come to the right place. We have a LOT of restaurants, some not so great, and some fantastic ones. The ratio of restaurants to people is one of the highest in the nation.   If you like the outdoors, we have mountains all around us. There are parks, greenways, and dog parks, lakes and rivers, even a skate park or two. There are places to rock climb/boulder, and lots of community sports.   There is a university, so if you like college sports, we have plenty of them. We also have a pretty good Ice Hockey team.   Our downtown area is ""up and coming."" The city started revitalizing downtown >10 years ago, and it is now a really nice place to walk/shop/watch shows, etc. We have a few pretty good breweries in town, one of which is downtown. There are bars and clubs downtown and in the old city.   There are plays, concerts, free live music in bars, game stores, nerd/geek culture. If you are into making things, we have a group called the Knox makers. They have a big facility that has all sorts of tools. You pay a monthly fee and then have access to a big workshop full of things from saws to 3D printers.   I generally describe Knoxville as a small city (as opposed to a big town). We have a little bit of everything here, but none of the horrendous traffic troubles of a bigger city. I pretty much love this city. ;)"

This would be in the direction from which you heard the boom, I believe, and it syncs up time wise. I think I got in the traffic jam at about 12:25 or 12:30.

It is in the Fountain City area. (county, not city)  Every year, our next door neighbors shoot off $2000 or more of fireworks.  They do music/light show and about 40-50 people are usually there.  They have been doing this for at least the last 10 years.   I'm not exaggerating the $2000.  It's a lot of loud, big fireworks that everybody chips in and they give us the amount donated each year.  The music is LOUD, people are loud, the fireworks last 20-30 minutes.  We have a police officer who lives on our street.  Nobody has ever said a word about the fireworks and the police haven't come either.  I only give you this background because I look at it as a green light to shoot fireworks on the 4th of July.  Police use laws to control behavior when they believe that there is a situation that they need to help resolve.   The 4th of July and fireworks is not that situation.  Start shooting them in an apartment building, at cars, at people, (IE stupid stuff) and I'm sure the law of no fireworks will need to be enforced."

Two is that it tends to be above freezing while snow is still on the ground, and then back below overnight, so the roads all turn to ice."

My first year at UT, I once biked to class in shorts on Monday and then we got out of school for snow on Friday, then the snow melted and I biked to class in shorts on Monday, and then we got out again Friday for freezing rain."
Knoxville,3bv168,xAdakis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"It is not half as bad as looks. The last ""storm"" we had produced a lot of very powdery snow. It builds up, but step on it and it compacts to nothing.  The worst part is the roads, which can get a nice thick sheet of ice on it, but most major roads are salted ahead of time. Our road was not salted, but we could get down to the main road by putting on some snow chains.   This snow also only lasted about a week before it melted off with the University only being closed/delay for a couple of days."

Knoxville,3bv168,iwpoe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:22:20 2015 UTC,"If we got a ""few feet of snow"" the city would stop functioning for a week.  The winter itself is mild, and the snow will mostly be a problem because they won't service secondary roads for many days. Avoid driving close to others while driving in the snow, since they won't know what they're doing."
Knoxville,3bv168,PetulantVol,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:37:22 2015 UTC,"If we got a ""few feet of snow"" the city would stop functioning for a week.   See Blizzard of March 1993 for reference. That was the most snowfall we've ever had in a 48 hour period since I've been alive (45 years now) and the coldest it has gotten was in 1985 when we got down to -24F. I would be more worried about late July into August than winters. Later summer heat combined with stifling humidity makes it miserable."

Or, you know, we could do the middle ages style angry torch mob thing... That's worked so well at solving these types of issues over the last 2,000 years.

It's one thing to lack empathy (lots of people do), but when that feature is combined with sadism, you have a truly dangerous personality.   Unfortunately, treatment for psychopathy (if that's the diagnosis) is about as effective as ""praying away the gay"".

This kind of behavior is unacceptable.  Yes, maybe who did this has a mental illness, but that doesn't change the fact that this person is too dangerous to have running around.  Usually if someone is willing to commit this kind of atrocity on animals, they will move on to people."
Knoxville,3bt80v,darkbluberrymuffin,5,Thu Jul 2 04:37:34 2015 UTC,"I don't view it as defense, but as protecting ourselves. People who mutilate and sexually abuse animals have a tendency to move on to people if left untreated. Knoxville doesn't want a serial killer."
Knoxville,3bt80v,chimneytop,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:48:59 2015 UTC,"If we don't want a serial killer then let's not groom this person to be one. My point is that the person already has a hard time feeling empathy. Common sense would dictate that they have obviously experienced something that caused this lack of emotional awareness. They must have experienced some kind of violence and / or lack of proper social judgement in their own lives as a child.   That's depressing and unfair since they didn't choose to have those experiences. So when society shows more aggression and disgust to this person instead of concern and sadness, then we justify their perception. At this point, it is our role as a community to prevent making this person feel like it is their ""fate"" to harm others or like everyone is out to get them. In the case that they get out (which is very likely) then we need to give them a reason not to want to harm others.  I find it fascinating that in 2015 people still don't understand that no one is born ""evil"". Human psychology has always shown that love and understanding are more more effective tools for solving conflict than hate and violence. Most of the people who do these things have already been through Hell and if you were in their shoes you'd be at risk for the same psychological issues. We have to learn to stop to stop judging the behavior of others by our personal set of experiences and perceptions..."
Knoxville,3bt80v,SonVolt,3,Thu Jul 2 14:14:33 2015 UTC,"Common sense would dictate that they have obviously experienced something that caused this lack of emotional awareness. They must have experienced some kind of violence and / or lack of proper social judgement in their own lives as a child.    That is a misconception born and perpetuated by Hollywood and the media. Psychopathy (complete lack of empathy) is not  necessarily environmental. In fact it appears to be a condition where the brain actually operates in strikingly and fundamentally abnormal way. This can be seen on fmri scans when subjects are exposed to certain stimuli but fail to respond. This could be caused by physical trauma, complications from a childhood illness, or just a genetic glitch. It's actively being researched. There is some debate about whether to reclassify people who score high for psychopathy (using traditional diagnostic techniques),  but don't have same nuerological features.  I admire your compassion, but criminal psychopathy isn't about someone who just needs some hugs. There isn't a cure and therapy is of questionable efficacy. It's a tough problem for society."

Knoxville,3bt80v,SonVolt,2,Thu Jul 2 14:21:26 2015 UTC,"There's a ton of research happening in and around psychopathy. To say we're doing nothing or being recklessly despondent is wrong. The problem is that this brand of disorder has proven exceptionally difficult to remedy. To re-use your tenuous metaphor, we're starving and we're searching for food, but there's none to be found.

They need to be removed from the population forever and studied like a bug under a microscope. My first thought when I read about it was that these are the missing pets of someone this sicko knows- that it had to be personal. I don't think this is some drugged up HS kid prank and I really hope they find the fucker. I'm not super familiar with that area- how close is it to 40? Knoxville is an interstate hub & KP runs right along 40. Maybe it's not a Knoxvillian. So sad.
Knoxville,3bt80v,SonVolt,2,Thu Jul 2 16:08:08 2015 UTC,"They are more likely to do something like that if we throw them in prison and teach them to think like a criminal for five or six years. Once society has put this individual through our embarrassment of a justice system, they will come out feeling even angrier and more resentful towards people in general. It's best to help them sort through whatever they are feeling now before they get angry enough to consider hurting people. The point is that this time it was dogs. That's a terrible thing, but the individual has not hurt any people yet. Now we are tasked with making sure that they don't.   Prison and aggression are tried and untrue methods that lead to a person feeling hopeless and reckless upon release. And make no mistake, this individual will more than likely be released sooner than later. It's high time that we start to use our heads as a society and begin working to understand human psychology and the root causes for unacceptable behavior instead of just trying to medicate and jail our all of our problems away. I'm not saying that this person should be out out on the streets, and I am also not defending their behavior. I'm just suggesting that we should consider not fighting fire with fire. We don't know what this person has been through, and a bit of understanding / compassion during the process could show them that there is value in society and the human spirit."

Knoxville,3br22u,bs6,3,Wed Jul 1 15:11:48 2015 UTC,"Because it is a tradition in America dating back to colonial times.  Country folk did not have ready access to fireworks, which at the time were usually reserved for royalty, so they found ways of celebrating by making a big noise:  bell ringing, cheering around a bonfire, and blowing the shit outta anvils.  I will guess that anvils were handy because it was an excuse to make a huge explosion ""(It's heavy, dear, I have to use a lot of gunpowder) and it was an item that was likely to survive the blast and be used after the celebration."

Knoxville,3bjt16,misaxchan10,3,Mon Jun 29 23:11:26 2015 UTC,Agreed. And then those of us with kids have an even tougher time I thing. Especially coming her without knowing anyone to begin with.
Knoxville,3bjt16,JCougar,2,Mon Jun 29 22:55:27 2015 UTC,"Sure that makes things more difficult, but who cares.  If you want to meet new people, you have to go out and meet new people.  It's a simple as that, no excuses.   And if you like drinking, go to Union Jacks.  There's always a bar full of opinionated regulars willing to pass judgement on the girls who walk in."
Knoxville,3bjt16,Woolio,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:16:25 2015 UTC,"I go to UT right now, and have... very few friends. Shockingly few.   Not all of us are socialites."

Knoxville,3bjt16,Spirit_Invader,2,Mon Jun 29 21:55:21 2015 UTC,"I'll be moving here in two months.  I grew up in a small town in Florida.  I then moved to Miami for 14 years.  Both had their quirks about meeting people.  The internet is beautiful in that you can find groups of interest in meetup.com.  When I settle down - I will start my search for those that may like what I do.  Cycling, Hiking, Beer Brewing, Building Stuff, Music and just chilling.  Knoxville seems to have a lot of outdoor resources, so I think I will be OK.  I thought people were friendly - so my wife picked up a job in knox and I was allowed to work from home for my job.  BTW - last time I was in knoxville, there was some bar that was not part of the main street that was awesome.  I remembered it had solar panels on the roof, jenga blocks, bean bag toss games and beer you had to order inside by the bottle I believe.  Anyone know what the name of that place was?     Edit- it was the Bearden Beer Market.  Super chill place. Cornhole and Jenga games are awesome to bring people together."
Knoxville,3bjt16,NessaVey,2,Tue Jun 30 11:46:05 2015 UTC,Was it Armada? One of my friends owns that place and the bean bag toss sounds like it.
Knoxville,3bjt16,Lovelace_does,15,Tue Jun 30 17:41:00 2015 UTC,"Drink. Drink a lot. Go out to bars. Go to shows (there are plenty of live music venues). Honestly, the trick to breaking into a friend group is to hang around, don't be a dick, and strike up conversations with people. But hanging at bars that are frequented by the kinds of people you think you want to be friends with will eventually get you noticed and give you opportunity to make friends. The whole ""oh, I've seen you around, my name is..."" actually happens quite often downtown."

Knoxville,3bjt16,That_Sam_Girl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:50:24 2015 UTC,Seconded! I've made a ton of new friends since starting swing dancing classes 2 months ago.
Knoxville,3bjt16,WeazelBear,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:08:43 2015 UTC,Is that something someone with absolutely no experience can start? I've been wanting to learn swing forever.
Knoxville,3bjt16,That_Sam_Girl,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:02:48 2015 UTC,Yep! Beginner lesson at 7:30 at the Laurel Theater on Wednesdays. $2. They start verrrry basic so it's welcoming to people who are afraid. Like I was.

Knoxville,3bjt16,Chumstick,0,Tue Jun 30 02:12:19 2015 UTC,"Check my comment history on this sub and you'll see that I'm not the hipster you're implying I am. I actually have tried answering these type threads several times. Also, I've voiced my hatred for The Casual Pint."
Knoxville,3bjt16,JCougar,3,Tue Jun 30 02:18:37 2015 UTC,"The owner of Casual Pint Hardin Valley is an exceptional guy and has been a huge asset to the homebrew club.  That's the only reason i go.  CP has a very rudimental selection, but that is a direct reflection of our distribution."
Knoxville,3bjt16,Chumstick,5,Tue Jun 30 11:53:23 2015 UTC,"Selection isn't my problem with The Casual Pint. My problem is just a matter of taste. It feels like someone copied a floor plan for a Starbucks, furniture and lighting included, and put beer where coffee should go and taps instead of frappe machines.   The environment while having a drink in there feels very much ""big-box"" - like if IKEA designed a pub. I just don't like it. I'm all for locally owned bars, just not that one."
Knoxville,3bjt16,JCougar,5,Tue Jun 30 13:16:06 2015 UTC,"Ha!  I always describe it as a coffee shop for beer.  The thing is that there are many in the generations older than ours that want to experience craft beer, but don't like going bars.  That's where CP fits in.  It's innocuous.  It's tame.  It's suburban.  Basically, it's a good entry-level establishment for folk in their 40s who were too busy with kids and careers to experience the craft beer boom of the 00s.  It's a place that won't upset your wife.   It's  inviting for those who would otherwise feel lost in a bottle shop.  It's a step stool next to Kroger.  It has wi-fi.  It's the freshman lunch table."
Knoxville,3bjt16,yet_again,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:56:19 2015 UTC,What places do you recommend then?
Knoxville,3bjt16,Chumstick,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:36:21 2015 UTC,"It depends on a few different things, but I can tell you this much - if you like the Casual Pint (which is fine if you do, I just don't.) then you're not going to have any use for my recommendations."
Knoxville,3bjt16,yet_again,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:51:29 2015 UTC,"They're alright. I mainly enjoy Casual Pint because of their food policy and their consistency across the branches. I've sat at the bar and struck up conversations with strangers and the staff before. They all seem nice enough, but that's not really what I go there for. At the end of the day, I just like being able to bring Five Guys burgers and fries in and enjoy the freshness of the beers on tap, as opposed to a bottle or can at home, and people watch. I've definitely seen the sort of regulars /u/JCougar describes. That's why when I go to Casual Pint, I usually go there to meet friends I already know. It's a very neutral environment, just like a Starbucks. The one I go to is also very close to my house. Convenient.  When I want a more enjoyable, more beer/drink-centered, experience, I go to other places. I like the Bearden Beer Market because I can sit outside and bring my dog and watch him go nuts when other pups walk by. Add on the food trucks and the younger customers, and I'd say it's probably my favorite spot to go. I like the Library because the cocktails are phenomenal and there's always a sort of surprisingly-urban atmosphere in there that I've only seen in bigger cities like Chicago and New York. I've been to a few other places: Fort Sanders Yacht Club, Preservation Pub, Downtown Grill & Brewery, Barley's, Crown & Goose, Jig & Reel, Urban Bar, Clancy's, and Suttree's to name a few. Suttree's is probably the place I go to most downtown.  I've heard good things about Public House and Central Flats & Taps, just haven't had a chance yet to go to either. I'm always looking for good recommendations though."
Knoxville,3bjt16,loosyd_56,2,Fri Jul 3 19:45:00 2015 UTC,You got me on that one.

Usually, people hang out at friends houses and bar-b-que, having a place to crash in advance is crucial as check points become rather abundant.   If I catch one of you fuckers DUI'ing because you didn't find/make plans like adults, I'll run you off the road myself."
Knoxville,3bjn2x,Chumstick,6,Tue Jun 30 00:12:05 2015 UTC,"Fireworks on a day other than boomsday? Blasphemy. If you really want to have a good time before the so-called fireworks,  I recommend the Museum of Appalachia's Anvil shoot. How can you go wrong with black powder booms big enough to send anvils flying?   I know it seems kinda nerdy going to a museum and all, but it's actually a really good time. Good bluegrass music too."
Knoxville,3bjn2x,justy98,3,Tue Jun 30 06:49:42 2015 UTC,"If you're just looking for fireworks, I always go to the show in Oak Ridge at the rec center/library."

Knoxville,3bjn2x,one-hour-photo,2,Tue Jun 30 18:08:23 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually seen those ones, but I go almost every year because there is always plenty of parking and it doesn't make it some huge hassle to go. And I think it's a good show."
Knoxville,3bjn2x,FrankieAK,2,Tue Jun 30 20:06:00 2015 UTC,I second the suggestion from /u/justy98 on going to see the anvil shoot at the Museum of Appalachia.  Here is a video I did of it back in 2013.

Knoxville,3bjz28,justy98,3,Tue Jun 30 13:09:26 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to go ahead and say this. I got married two years ago. I learned a few things about the process. Most important of those things, there's only one thing from the wedding you'll keep: your pictures. It's the only place I'd recommend splurging on price. In my opinion, Jennie Andrews is the best there is in Knoxville."
Knoxville,3bjz28,justy98,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:00:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice.  I'm grappling with this because we are trying to keep expenses low.  How much does Jennie Andrews cost?  I really like her pictures.
Knoxville,3bjz28,denganzenabend,2,Tue Jun 30 13:08:06 2015 UTC,"We tried very hard to keep expenses low. My wife was amazing about it. For example, we bought our linens online for cheap (about half the cost of rental) then sold them on CL afterwards for the same price as we bought them. We saved most of our money from the venue. Look everywhere, not just the big ones everybody knows. My SIL got married at a state park for next to free, and it was freakin' beautiful. Magical, candles at the lakefront, it looked like something out of a movie. Also, food is food. We didn't have a sit-down dinner, and we bought a couple kegs from a local brewery and some cases of local wine for the bar (we got discounts because we were buying bulk, and the owners were willing to do more discounts after talking with them, getting to know them). It was far cheaper than an open bar (liquor cost much much more than just beer and wine). It was a great time, and everybody raved about the food. But it was so much cheaper and easier to feed them off nice plasticware that they served themselves with than to have a sit-down dinner service. All Occasions catering worked wonders on it, and they have something for every budget.   I can't speak to Jennie's cost. It's not cheap, and it could be different now. We got lots of quotes and hers was most, by a good amount. Also, she has worked with lots of great photographers. If you absolutely can't afford her, she can probably recommend someone that she has worked with as a second.    I have friends that are very qualified and would have done it for free. However, I'm so happy my wife talked me into spending on the pictures. Since our wedding, we've had friends that had terrible pictures, and not just bad pictures, but bad setups. The best looking pictures are no good if the bride and her mother are not in the same frame, not once in any of them. Seriously, we have good friends that had that issue with their wedding. No pics of the bride and her mother! Another friend had a photographer that ruined the wedding by having too many posed shots. The wedding party had to take pictures for like three hours between the ceremony and the reception. By the time we got there, half the guests were wasted, the food was cold, and some had even gone home. I'm going on and on, but it really was the best money we spent. And the pics turned out great. I was adamantly against spending so much where we could have had it done for free. I'm happy to admit that I was wrong. I don't remember most of the wedding, it flew by! I hardly ate any of the food or drank any of the beverages (We were too busy spending time with everybody that came). We only danced to a few songs, and then it was over, but we got soooo many great pictures that I can enjoy any time I want."

Knoxville,3bhc0p,un_confident,3,Mon Jun 29 06:01:03 2015 UTC,That's what my very first thought was too! (Burning plane.) But obviously had to be a meteor or perhaps some spacecraft burning up on atmospheric entry.
