More doom metal than stoner IMO but I am a huge fan of kyuss/queens, Witchcraft, All Them Witches etc. All slightly lighter but all awesome. The other thing about Witchcraft is I didn't enjoy their other albums very much, but this particular one is just great."

stonerrock,3drlgg,jczik,9,Sun Jul 19 00:12:31 2015 UTC,"I like it, but I wish they hadn't cleaned up so much. Sounds like they're playing in a higher tuning than the usual C standard too."
stonerrock,3drlgg,Und_Keine_Eier,5,Sat Jul 18 22:31:14 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. Saw them in Ft Worth Tx a couple of months ago. They played five songs from the new album. When they played the new songs, they had to switch instruments. If say Eb if I was guessing."
stonerrock,3drlgg,GrandMasterC,2,Sat Jul 18 22:40:34 2015 UTC,The song High Country is definitely in Eb; I learned a bit of it by ear yesterday and Eb tuning fit really well.

stonerrock,3d6y8t,VintageOctopus,4,Tue Jul 14 03:52:52 2015 UTC,"The only one coming to mind for me is The Sword - Apocryphon.  I was just coming off of the masterpiece that was Warp Riders and felt like it was a step backward musically, probably because Warp Riders was such a drastic departure from their first two albums.  It took several more listens to really start to appreciate the myriad of subtle ways that the music was evolving while staying true to their original sound.  I get chills every time I hear that solo on Eyes of the Stormwitch."
stonerrock,3d6y8t,DarkGregRE,2,Tue Jul 14 00:45:52 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed Apocryphon! You're right, Warp Riders was hard to top. Actually their second album still hasn't grown on me yet."

stonerrock,3d6y8t,mxtrav,4,Tue Jul 14 18:09:25 2015 UTC,"Wayyyyy back in the day when Mastodon's Leviathan came out I didn't like that for at least a year. Crack the Skye took some time for me to get into also. Well I liked it, but not as much as their other stuff, but now it's my favorite of their's.  I didn't really dig Sleep's Dopesmoker the first few times I listened to it."
stonerrock,3d6y8t,TheLegendofJoe,2,Tue Jul 14 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"It took me awhile to get into Leviathan. I came in on Blood Mountain and loved it, then was blown away by Crack The Skye. I t took me a while to go backwards in their discography, I'm glad I did now. Crack The Skye is still my favorite though.  Dopesmoker man, love it. The first time I listened to it I was really nervous about my first review at my job and put it on, totally calmed me down. I don't know why I was nervous in the first place, but it set me straight."
stonerrock,3d6y8t,mxtrav,2,Tue Jul 14 18:07:21 2015 UTC,"Leviathan was my first from them, bought it probably the first month it came out. Took me about a year to get into it. It has been my favorite of their's ever since, until a couple weeks ago when I just consciously realized that I actually enjoyed Crack the Skye more finally.  When Dopesmoker click for me was when I listened to it during a lab portion of a class I was taking. It was just perfect for the setting and have loved it ever since."
stonerrock,3d6y8t,Skagbaronkris,3,Tue Jul 14 18:34:05 2015 UTC,Ausserwelt by Year of No Light comes to mind. Until I was hungover on a Sunday. Then it all made sense.

stonerrock,3d6y8t,TheLegendofJoe,2,Tue Jul 14 12:34:17 2015 UTC,"I bought Electric Wizard's album Black Masses on an impulse because it looked sweet in the store, had never heard them. I got home and put it on and though I had wasted my money, went at it in the entirely wrong mindset. About a month later it shuffled on while I was intoxicated and just sent me to a really weird place that I needed more of. Ever since I've been a diehard Electric Wizard fan, but Black Masses has stayed as their top album for me, and one of my top albums overall.   There's less stories to them, but Mastodon: Remission and The Sword: Warp Riders also took awhile to click. Theses days I listen to those the most of their respective discographies."
stonerrock,3d6y8t,Emthigious,2,Tue Jul 14 14:40:42 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to me with Earth Rocker and The Hunter. I threw them into my playlist on shuffle. The bass work and vocals on The Hunter I'm starting to love more and more, and Earth Rocker I just didn't take the time to really listen. I listened to that album for the first time expecting and album full of 'hit singles' and was severely disappointed. Nothing really stood out to me. But it's became one of my favorite clutch albums next to Blast Tyrant."

stonerrock,3d5ikd,LeoKhenir,3,Mon Jul 13 19:28:46 2015 UTC,What instrument are you going to play?
stonerrock,3d5ikd,LeoKhenir,3,Mon Jul 13 19:46:59 2015 UTC,I play the drums. Any insights into typical fills and beats? Prevalent motifs used?
stonerrock,3d5ikd,enough_space,8,Mon Jul 13 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"Crash-riding is a common way of playing heavier parts of songs ""4 by 6 halfbeats"" rhythms. That is, the rest of the band would play a 6/8 rhythm while the drummer will play straight 4's but in half the beat. So the guitarist will count 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 for instance, in which the drummer counts 1 and a 2 and a 3 and a 4 and a, with hihat/ride on the wholes and the snare on 3. Accent with bassdrum to the guitar/bass lines' natural rhythm. Check out the drums for ""Throwing your life away"" by Spiritual Beggars for an example. Even if it's not halfbeat, you hear the guitar/bass play in 6 while the drums play basically a flat 2/4 rhythm.    Most importantly, play with feel and groove. I've heard many a stoner band lose all groove because of a mechanical metronome-perfect drummer. Dance on the kit. Explore unconventional beat patterns in your fills.   Hope this helps a bit. ""Throwing Your Life Away"" again is really a good example of how you employ simple drumming with a lot of feels to it. Personally I think it actually is one of the best examples of how simple and effective it is possible to play drums in this genre."

I don't hate them, I just don't see what the big deal about them is.   That said, the song ""Unsandpiper"" does hold a special place for me. Probably because one night I fell asleep with my good headphones on. I had all the songs tagged ""stoner rock"" on my phone playing on shuffle. I started to have a dream as that song started. I can only describe the dream as High School Musical: Kyuss Edition. It was a weird dream of how the band came to be during their high school days. In the dream, as the radio portion of the song is playing in the beginning, Josh is in his garage while the song is starting. It gets goofy from there. Nick Oliveri looked like an adult version of Butters (South Park). It was pretty surreal."

stonerrock,3cln39,jczik,8,Wed Jul 8 21:36:02 2015 UTC,"Full text for those who cannot access Facebook:   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CLUTCH TO RELEASE NEW ALBUM “PSYCHIC WARFARE” OCTOBER 2ND 2015  July 8th 2015 - Clutch, the influential heavy rock band from Maryland, will release its eleventh studio album “Psychic Warfare” October 2nd via their own label Weathermaker Music. The album was produced by longtime producer Machine (Lamb Of God, Every Time I Die) and consists of 12 new tracks. “The title ‘Psychic Warfare’ is taken from the track, ‘X-Ray Visions” states singer Neil Fallon. “It’s a tale about an unnamed protagonist who is forced to seek refuge in a flop house motel. He is hiding from several nefarious psychic forces, the worst of which is his own sleep deprived paranoia.” The album cover was designed by renowned photographer Dan Winters.  Clutch is comprised of vocalist/guitarist Neil Fallon, drummer Jean-Paul Gaster, guitarist Tim Sult, and bassist Dan Maines.  “Psychic Warfare” track listing:   The Affidavit  X-Ray Visions  Firebirds  A Quick Death in Texas  Sucker For The Witch Your Love is Incarceration Doom Saloon  Our Lady of Electric Light  Noble Savage Clutch  Behold the Colossus  Decapitation Blues  Son Of Virginia   Clutch have been pushing the boundaries that define heavy rock music since the four original members got together in high school. Clutch is an unmatched musical force that has been best described as “the quintessential American Rock Band”. They released their tenth studio album Earth Rocker via their own label Weathermaker Music on March 16, 2013. The album entered the Billboard Top 200 chart at #15 giving the band their highest chart position to date.   Clutch’s Earth Rocker reached #1 on the Rock Chart and #4 on iTunes' overall Top 100 album chart. Earth Rocker was awarded “Album of The Year” by Metal Hammer and garnered a Top 10 spot on Rolling Stone’s “Top 20 Metal Albums of the Year”. Rolling Stone further enthused: “Four Maryland lifers — road dogs who've been grinding since the early Fugazi administration, cranking out seething admixtures of jam-band chops, careening blues-punk riffs and singer Neil Fallon's nerdy, piss-taking wiseass lyrics — release their hardest rocking set to date. Look for a go-go break (and some clever punning on the phrase ""drop the bomb!) on ‘D.C. Sound Attack!’ Inspirational verse: “if you're gonna do it/ do it live on stage/ or don't do it at all.”  Clutch will be touring extensively in 2015 to support the effort. A string of shows, including festival dates have been announced leading up to the release.  08/15 - GwarBQ @ Hadad's Lake - Richmond, VA  09/04 - The Joint @ The Hard Rock Hotel - Las Vegas, NV - special guest for Primus   09/19 - The Shindig @ Carrol Park - Baltimore, MD  09/20 - The Rock Carnival @ Oak Ridge Park - Clark, NJ  10/24 - Aftershock Festival - Sacramento, CA  10/25 - Knotfest @ San Manuel Amphitheater - San Bernardino, CA  10/31 - Voodoo Festival - New Orleans, LA"

stonerrock,3cbva8,Dividan84,10,Tue Jul 7 01:47:02 2015 UTC,I dunno. Warp Riders and Apocryphon seem a lot different from AoW to me.
stonerrock,3cbva8,Lashloch,5,Tue Jul 7 08:29:36 2015 UTC,"This. Age of Winters and Gods of the Earth were awesome, but for me I really started enjoying them more with the improved production and vocals (IMO) that came with Warp Riders."

Im glad this subreddit is much more open minded about the evolution of artists as opposed to other subreddits like r/metal. I don't think I would like them as much as I do if every album sounded like age of winters. Don't get me wrong, Age of Winters was amazing for what it was, but they have improved as musicians so much since then."

Dinosaur itself means ""terror lizard"", so it's still technically correct.   *takes off pants*  Their new album is imo absolutely amazing. Especially the songs El Monstro and Gigantos are my favourites this year."
stonerrock,3bzjih,robothelvete,2,Fri Jul 3 14:49:46 2015 UTC,"El Monstro   Yes, yes, YES. The riffs are so fucking good and that femal voice is just the cherry on the fucking cake. Also check out the album before (their first one?). Its pretty good.  I love that they sing in swedish, we have way too few non-anglo bands singing in their mother tongue."
stonerrock,3bzjih,nbgbernd,4,Fri Jul 3 16:23:46 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I really liked their first album as well, but I feel that they've stepped it up a notch with this new one. And honestly, I'd listened a bit too much to Äppelträdet before they finally released this.   EDIT: The only problem I see with them singing in Swedish is that too few people understand their wonderfully weird lyrics.   ""A cactus rose up and said, Cactus Galaxus, that is me"" - I mean really, it's perfect stoner lyrics :D"
stonerrock,3bzjih,robothelvete,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:29:19 2015 UTC,"I think their debut album was so fucking good, really wondered why they are not more popular. I understand your lyric point, as a German I feel the same with Rammstein (the lyrics are just weird and like riddles). But Swedish is a really melodic and nice language, so Im glad I they sing in Swedish (plus do I understand a bit, I had Swedish lessions)."

Added bonus with the art work and all the game of thrones imagery.  It felt like these guys stood heads and shoulders above what anyone else did at the time.  I remember seeing them in '06 open for Trivium and they stole the show with their first chord.  Nothing had sounded so rich and heavy.  They brought emphasis on tone, rhythm, song writing and singing.  Its like someone figured out how to balance Black Sabbath with Slayer."

stonerrock,3broxa,omnithought,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:24:58 2015 UTC,I think part of it is they're tuned in Eb on this song vs their normal C Standard tuning.
stonerrock,3broxa,sacrdcloth,6,Thu Jul 2 03:27:14 2015 UTC,"It's obviously only the title track and clearly written to be a single, but this is exactly what I expected to hear. Further progression in the same direction of their last two albums. I guess the writing was on the wall when they said they didn't like people moshing at their shows and would cease writing and playing that kind of music =/"
stonerrock,3broxa,femaiden,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:50:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I never liked people moshing at Sword shows... doesn't fit the music for me. But there's something about their riffs, something heavy, and just a certain progression you can feel in most of their songs, but it's not here."
stonerrock,3broxa,lostereadamy,6,Wed Jul 1 17:10:18 2015 UTC,Moshing and doom don't go together very well. It feels like a lot of people just kinda mosh because they think its what you do at a show. It's annoying.
stonerrock,3broxa,femaiden,9,Wed Jul 1 22:19:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its kind of a drag.  Oddly enough, one time I was at a Bayside show and the crowd was going nuts. That was a pleasant surprise. Also had a little chubby girl come up and start feeling me up which was cool. She told me she had pierced nips (first words out of her mouth). A little stunned, I just kinda said ""Cool... mine aren't pierced."" And she left. I don't have the training for this."

But post-metal bands touring with stoner and doom bands was what dragged me out of listening to nothing but punk and hardcore over a decade ago so I definitely can appreciate an Isis album being posted. Isis with Russian Circles and Dälek was probably my first non punk/hardcore/ska type show I ever went to and that was it for me. Next few shows were High on Fire, Torche, the Sword, Pelican etc.. Never looked back. Edit: to be fair to myself I inherited a bunch of Sabbath CDs in middle school and always loved them at least."

I just asked if there are other bands that they have heavy sound and they experiment like them"
stonerrock,3b2frn,weinbee,7,Thu Jun 25 13:31:16 2015 UTC,"Baroness is definitely a good recommendation if you don't typically like traditional metal. check out 'Red' for something heavier and more raw, and 'Blue' for something a bit more nuanced."

Their catalog is kind of all over the place. Their really early stuff is hardcore, then they got kind of hipster metal, then they got kind of progressivey, and lately they've gotten strangely stonery. I like their stuff up to and including Leviathan, as well as their most recent stonery album."

When it came out I thought it sounded really ""scene"" oriented, if that makes any sense, so it kind of turned me off. Then I got into different things (doom, stoner, psych, traditional). And I just haven't really revisited it at all. Perhaps it is really good. I just didn't subjectively enjoy it for the longest time."

The album this song is from also features After Dark, from that scene in From Dusk Till Dawn with you-know-who doing you-know-what (where the band actually appears on stage in the film). I like their dusty, deserty, stoner/blues sound and feel a lot.   They have five albums out (that vary a bit from release to release), but all are worth a spin. I hear they are big in Germany, for some reason."

A couple of albums that have come out this year that I'd add to my top five would be XII Boar - Pitworthy (imagine AC/DC meets Motorhead, just good time heavy groovy rock), Weedpecker - II (like Lore but even more psychedelic) and Ten Foot Wizard - Sleeping Volcanoes (gigged with them a few times now and they're an amazing live show).  My live highlight of the year has to be Earthless in Manchester, that was something special.   I'm pretty new to stoner rock so I'm still exploring the genre but goddamn there's so much good music out there!"

Starting with The Hunter, they started to take more of a throwback rock approach to stuff. Personally, I LOVE it, as it combines their mathy-ness with the hooky-ness of bands like The Sword, but I totally understand that it's not for everyone. Also, for what it's worth...sounding like Tool ain't a bad thing where I come from."
stonerrock,3afsth,StoneAgeWolf,3,Fri Jun 19 19:59:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely my favorite track off the new album. Goes without saying this band know how to create some truly epic anthems that stirs something within you.

stonerrock,3afsth,tastychicken,2,Sat Jun 20 17:04:32 2015 UTC,"I agree, my best friend and I are really into the band, and High on Fire was the first band I saw live with him, so it was and is music we've both bonded to.   Matt is almost like a demigod or something. Dude just knows how to write a good song and sticks behind his principles. Definitely music that makes you want to ride into battle or hunt mammoths in the frozen tundra!"

When I explained that to a friend he recommended Sleep to me and I've been sold since, it's everything I've been searching for in music!  Matt is so insane, he just seems like a genuinly cool dude that can make simple riffs that are SO FUCKING BRUTAL. The riff in The Cave is huge and it's still super simple.

stonerrock,3ae7xi,tastejustlikechicken,4,Fri Jun 19 12:04:33 2015 UTC,I saw CoC open up for Metallica in '96. After hearing this and Albatross I was hooked. Deliverance and Wiseblood have been in the rotation ever since. CoC was my gateway band to stoner rock.
stonerrock,3ae7xi,P90SG22,2,Fri Jun 19 14:08:46 2015 UTC,"Those two albums were their best in my opinion.  While the band makeup certainly changed a lot over the years, it still amazes me that they started off like this."
stonerrock,3ae7xi,P90SG22,2,Fri Jun 19 14:17:50 2015 UTC,"I have had similar thoughts too. I think the band evolved with the maturity of Woody and Mike Dean. The band literally grew up with them.   Also, you have to consider they've always been CoC. No matter what they were playing or who was in the band they were always CoC. Most other groups would have spread out the material with other band names and side projects etc. They've always focused on doing their thing and haven't worried about the labeling.    Their last 4 studio albums have sounded vastly different from each other. The only significant personal difference being the abscence of Pepper and the inclusion of Stanton Moore on In The Arms of God. I don't really consider the other drummers coming and going much of a factor. Most people would have released those 4 albums under 4 different band names.   I think its stupid when band members form another band with the same members. The Bakerton Group for example! Why aren't those just intrumental Clutch albums? They can call themselves whatever they want, but to me they're Clutch! I've been a Clutch fan for almost 20 years now. When they started releasing albums as The Bakerton Group I knew nothing about it until several years later. If they would've been released as Clutch I would have enjoyed it several years prior."

stonerrock,3ab7nw,midwestrider,3,Thu Jun 18 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"Saw them on tour post-accident, and they sounded goooood, and looked like they were really having fun. John worked really hard to get back into guitar playing shape, and also took a lot of time to work on his voice. His vocal work on the Townes VanZandt tribute is really well above anything he had recorded with Baroness, and that was AFTER the accident. Katie Jones (strings and vocals on the TVZ tribute songs) BTW is the wife of Bjarte Rolland, the guitar player/song-writer for Kvelertak, and was the person who suggested Baroness audition their new bassist, Nick Jost. Nick kills it, IMO."

stonerrock,3ab7nw,AstorSapolsky,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:26:23 2015 UTC,"To be very clear - Nick and Sebastian were auditioned for the band after Matt and Alan made it very clear that they weren't coming back. Katie (my sister) is good friends with all these guys. The accident was pretty devastating. John really did climb a huge hill to overcome his injuries. I have not heard demos from the new album, but mutual friends tell me they are outstanding."

stonerrock,39ae5d,mxtrav,2,Wed Jun 10 18:30:54 2015 UTC,"Back in the day I used fucking hate this song, and it really turned me off of Clutch in general. Never bothered actually giving them a chance because of it.  I just recently saw Clutch live with Mastodon and finally got into them. Blast Tyrant is great.  This song can still suck my nuts though."
stonerrock,39ae5d,McChef,3,Wed Jun 10 13:04:32 2015 UTC,"Just curious...what about this song do you not like?  The binary chorus/title?  The preposterous lyrics?   Mick Schauer's keys?  Sult, Gaster and Maines are just straight rocking typical Clutch goodness.    Blast Tyrant is an amazing album, no doubt."
stonerrock,39ae5d,MaestroXC,3,Wed Jun 10 18:41:25 2015 UTC,"Was always the chorus. The song was played at least once a night on my old bowling league, so it got old real quick."

stonerrock,39ae5d,mxtrav,4,Wed Jun 10 15:39:02 2015 UTC,I just saw them at Red Rocks a little over a month ago.  They played a lot of Blast Tyrant and Earth Rocker.  I didn't catch anything off of their self titled or Elephant Riders.  A couple new songs which I wasn't thrilled with but that is how Clutch has always been for me.  I didn't really like them the first time I heard one of their songs but now they are probably my favorite band.
stonerrock,39ae5d,Cheezis_Chrust,2,Wed Jun 10 17:51:38 2015 UTC,Man I really wish I chad caught those bands on that tour. Must've been a killer show.

They're bluesy enough that I didn't really consider them a stoner rock band until i spent some time in this sub, but they shred nonetheless.   Blues Pills - they're more shit kicking 70's rock, but they'll fit the bill  Dead Meadow has some blues to em  The Muggs - they fucking rock  The Pack A.D. - they aren't stoner rock at all, but neither is Black Pistol Fire. If you like one, you'll probably like the other. Ive had both these bands play at the venue i own and they both fucking kill it"

It's funny, he was interviewed by both Tool, after Paul D'Amour left, and Metallica, after Jason Newsted left. I wonder what would be different if either band had hired him, would he be a household name? He sure deserves it.

stonerrock,394791,Sufferbus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:49:54 2015 UTC,"My pleasure.  There is a lot more where that came from - late 60s/early 70s-style/influenced rock (mostly heavily-blues-influenced heavy rock) is really my main thing...and has been ever since I discovered The Blue Garden by Masters of Reality back in 1988.    It seems like the ""stoner genre"" (or at least /r/stonerrock) has largely, though definitely not completely, left the style behind now.  But there's still some good stuff to be found on occasion.  Anyway, if you like this stuff (or some/any of it) and are interested in more, feel free to shoot me a message...I'm happy to share."

The whole album is heavy as fuck.  It's a sonic quest through a universe of sub woofer it's that fucking heavy.  But delicate.  Like a huge fucking butterfly of orange and black and red fluttering through a ever-wavering sky, Tinkerbelling about your head all pissed off with denied love because, like Tinkerbell loves Peter, this album loves you.  It wants to wrap itself around your head and slip into your ears and orgasmatize your senses with its liquid velvet sound.  It wants to make you feel the love it has for you, and fly off into space together, as one cosmically aural being."

I usually prefer a more heavy and distorted, almost a cacophonous, sound while going on a good trip, and Ewige has that more than Tempel.  Tempel evokes an image of a voyage through calm and then stormy seas, followed by the relieving drift toward tropical paradise.  Either way, it's often a toss-up between which album is going to end out the list.  All is usually the winner, with that absolutely gorgeous end track.  A sonic flight over fields of dandelions with bright fluffy clouds floating in the sky."

stonerrock,38tt84,greatbigtossedsalad,3,Sun Jun 7 01:32:11 2015 UTC,"Been asked that before fella so I know where you're coming from. It's a very fair point to make.  Metal-archives will cover the heavier aspects of the scene, sure. But some of the more straight up psychedelic aspects, they wont touch. I added a band once who got taken down with the explanation being that they were unsuitable for the site. This site is meant to cover the heavy and not so heavy, just eventually the whole of the stoner rock scene (which I would say includes doom, psych, fuzz, drone and so on).   Metal-archives also only really covers the bands, musicians, albums and songs. Where I want to take this - a long way down the line - is covering any part of the scene. Websites, local scenes, festivals, tours, notable venues and so on.  Metal-Archives is a great site at what it does, and I use it a lot, but the aim with Riffipedia is a little different. If it works that is haha.  EDIT: Something else I forgot to mention is that, metal-archives seems to focus on the minimum amount of information. It's very list heavy in its format. With this, I'm hoping to get as much information about things as possible on each page. Bold claim to make right now whilst the site is so empty and many pages are half completed, but that's the aim."

stonerrock,384mop,gwar37,2,Mon Jun 1 23:06:28 2015 UTC,"Man, i wish I knew how to write music."
stonerrock,384mop,Death_To_Dem_Homos,2,Tue Jun 2 01:06:05 2015 UTC,Subbed :)
stonerrock,384mop,Al-Bohri,4,Tue Jun 2 05:56:41 2015 UTC,"Great, but not their best"
stonerrock,384mop,TheLastNomad,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:14:22 2015 UTC,"OP, thanks for showing me that Elder put out a new album. The whole thing is phenomenal. And I might be acting like a little emotional girl right now, but these guys really know how to put emotion into their music."
stonerrock,3846zl,gwar37,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:59:45 2015 UTC,Listened to this yesterday. Not as good as I was hoping but still damned good. Will probably sink in after a few listens.
stonerrock,3846zl,clerk3745,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:45:41 2015 UTC,"There are a few songs I'm not digging, mostly because the lyrics are kinda dumb. Cofee and whiskey until the cows come home? Come on man."
stonerrock,384d77,SakisGamer,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"Just bought this album today after forgetting it was released back in April. It's really good.. I'm not sure if I like it as much as the legendary album III, but it's worth a listen!"
stonerrock,382mxn,tastejustlikechicken,3,Mon Jun 1 12:21:19 2015 UTC,thought about this song for the restaurant playlist /u/painfulcyst was looking for and can's stop listening to it.
stonerrock,382mxn,yoda7326,3,Mon Jun 1 12:22:54 2015 UTC,So fuckin' good!  That album is chocked full of wicked tunes.
stonerrock,3863tq,buttholebrigade,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:58:14 2015 UTC,fun fact: I'm in this video in a state of heavy innebriation
stonerrock,380wqu,theceure,8,Mon Jun 1 01:09:37 2015 UTC,"Riffs are cool, like most Ghost songs. Also like most Ghost songs, vocals are complete turn off. Just don't like the style, sounds mailed-in."
stonerrock,380wqu,mxtrav,2,Mon Jun 1 18:33:52 2015 UTC,I wish they'd go a bit deeper with the vocals. A good clean doom vocalist would work perfect. This song reminds me of the faster Candlemass songs. Leif Edling's style would work so damn well for this track.
stonerrock,380wqu,asheppard308,2,Mon Jun 1 20:59:46 2015 UTC,Completely agree. The intro riff is smooth. The verse riff is crushing and then boom. Intensity gone when the vocals hit. I know people that like Ghost because of the vocals. I personally lose interest. Much like Clutch.
stonerrock,380wqu,totylertarian,3,Mon Jun 1 21:05:54 2015 UTC,pretty good been looking forward to their new album since i was them at download couple of years ago
stonerrock,380wqu,lordadriancrossofsea,3,Mon Jun 1 13:44:02 2015 UTC,It sounds like the slower Slayer songs. The melodies are so catchy!
stonerrock,380wqu,smallstone,2,Mon Jun 1 17:48:05 2015 UTC,"Quite liking this, but I am a big fan of Ghost."
stonerrock,37z6uf,crazyEy3,5,Sun May 31 17:23:20 2015 UTC,These guys are friggin' rad.
stonerrock,37z6uf,Marius_de_Frejus,2,Sun May 31 18:35:05 2015 UTC,"Going to see them Thursday in seattle, should be badass."
stonerrock,37z6uf,JuiceFestival,2,Sun May 31 20:03:50 2015 UTC,"You will not be disappointed. Such a bluesy, organic sound. You can tell these guys love playing and do it often, and late into the night."
stonerrock,37z6uf,MotherOfPus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:24:54 2015 UTC,Damn that's good.
stonerrock,37z6uf,viberider,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:10:47 2015 UTC,ATW made my shitty day end pretty freakin' well.
stonerrock,37zfq0,herb_puffer,2,Sun May 31 18:29:03 2015 UTC,Thank you sir
stonerrock,37vj76,deputyshitbat,4,Sat May 30 19:21:46 2015 UTC,"Not my first time hearing it, but fuck man, this album is sooo good.  Saw that these guys are coming to my town in July with Mondo Drag, and Melvins play the night after.  I also saw Black Pussy last night, and am seeing them again tonight.  So much fuzz in my life right now, I love it."
stonerrock,37vj76,theblankettheory,1 point,Sat May 30 19:23:24 2015 UTC,You just wanted to show off your awesome deck. I hate you. You have made me very sad and jealous on a sunday of all days. For shame!
stonerrock,37vj76,ziper1221,1 point,Sun May 31 14:11:12 2015 UTC,Thats such a nice looking record player.
stonerrock,37vj76,nbgbernd,1 point,Sun May 31 18:22:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, this sound reminds me a lot on Led Zeppelin.  Thanks for sharing!"
stonerrock,37vj76,fat_chris,-9,Sun May 31 22:23:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty much a straight up Led Zeppelin clone. They didn't even try to do anything original here. I'm all for wearing your influences on your sleeve and I do love Led Zeppelin, but come on.  If all you want is to see a Zeppelin-esque band live there are plenty of good tributes around.  I'm also a bit annoyed that this sub has so many of these ""Look at this vinyl I bought"" picture posts. It could just have easily been a link to the music with a title or comment saying you enjoyed it so you bought the vinyl or whatever."
stonerrock,37vj76,fat_chris,4,Sat May 30 22:30:36 2015 UTC,"this whole sub most bum you out so much man.   do people really enjoy tribute bands?  I posted this picture because by now most of the people here have already heard this album. lots of us into the genre are also into analog music. My comment was also meant to serve as a bit of discussion, I talked about 4 different bands"
stonerrock,37vj76,typical_cracker,0,Sun May 31 15:03:45 2015 UTC,"I quite liked this subreddit to be honest, I've found some great music here. But that's the thing. I use it to introduce me to new music so posts like this hinder more than anything.  But people seem to like it so go for it. I'm a little disappointed at the downvotes from this otherwise decent community for expressing an opinion, whether it was unpopular or not."
stonerrock,37pkgg,tastejustlikechicken,17,Fri May 29 11:50:23 2015 UTC,"The yoda-like lyrics...""Fight me lately, tried to someone"" Six miles deep of fuzz Hard tempo change breaks Bass work that would make Geezer Butler smile Total jerk ending that proves how tight they were"
stonerrock,37pkgg,Leeps,6,Fri May 29 11:57:30 2015 UTC,I love how they turn the riff on it's head halfway through. I also love how I had it on pretty quiet and it still just made my cat shit itself. Best.
stonerrock,37pkgg,peetnote,11,Fri May 29 17:18:50 2015 UTC,to-DAY-yee-YAYYYEE
stonerrock,37pkgg,WhaleMetal,6,Fri May 29 15:18:19 2015 UTC,John Garcia just has amazing stage presence.
stonerrock,37pkgg,WhaleMetal,2,Fri May 29 19:07:32 2015 UTC,I think his solo album is the best complete album i have heard in many years.
stonerrock,37pkgg,bizdog,8,Fri May 29 19:20:42 2015 UTC,Ya that's a good one. But I gotta say Slo Burn is my favorite post-Kyuss Garcia release.
stonerrock,37pkgg,sleepingprawns,5,Fri May 29 19:35:18 2015 UTC,Yeah but that was 4 songs and the solo album does not sound like an attempt to do Kyuss over again like Slo Burn did to some extent.    It really gets better every time I listen to it.
stonerrock,37pkgg,BadMotorFinger91,5,Fri May 29 20:05:47 2015 UTC,"There were 5 more tracks that were of lower recording quality, but were still amazing. I like them more than most songs on the EP actually. Definitely check them out, the list's on Wikipedia."
stonerrock,37pkgg,mobileuseratwork,3,Fri May 29 21:49:46 2015 UTC,"i will, been a while since i listened to the whole EP anyways.    time for a revisit"
stonerrock,37pkgg,Arligan,4,Fri May 29 23:52:31 2015 UTC,i love that riff halfway through its so great
stonerrock,37pkgg,da_qtip,5,Fri May 29 23:46:44 2015 UTC,"This is the song that made fall in love with Kyuss, and stoner rock in general. Brings back memories of college too, love it."
stonerrock,37qewc,P90SG22,6,Fri May 29 15:58:57 2015 UTC,"Freedom Run by Kyuss is, fittingly, great to run to."
stonerrock,37qewc,warmBlack,5,Fri May 29 17:01:33 2015 UTC,"I like to listen to Om while I'm cycling. It's kinda peaceful, and the rhythm seems to help me with my cadence."
stonerrock,37qewc,GrandMasterC,4,Fri May 29 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"The first song I always listen to is Rancho Relaxo by Ridge.  I usually get Cherry Red by Earthless, too. Other than that it's just a random playlist."
stonerrock,37qewc,Murdoc_2,3,Fri May 29 16:05:36 2015 UTC,for me nothing beats Monster Magnet's Tab for long runs.
stonerrock,37qewc,DragPackDoug,3,Fri May 29 20:01:29 2015 UTC,My Brother the Wind - Electric Universe    It's full-throttle right off the bat and doesn't let up. Stonedeaf - Twinkle Nyquist Fuzz Tardis is also a banger that's ideal for moving your shoes.
stonerrock,37qewc,Gagenshatz,1 point,Fri May 29 21:18:13 2015 UTC,Both good suggestions. I will have to queue them up for my next run.

stonerrock,37qewc,ElectricManta,1 point,Sat May 30 04:47:13 2015 UTC,"I enjoy running but don't usually listen to stoner for workout music. But when I do it'll be instrumental stuff, like Earthless and My Sleeping Karma. And like /u/Smoked_Peasant said, Elder tends to be great early morning jogging material."

stonerrock,37r62k,painfulcyst,3,Fri May 29 19:01:08 2015 UTC,"well, it depends on the restaurant! if the folks down there are used to listen to some metal while eating, the are more musical options. If not, i would stick to space/desert rock scene. Brant Bjork, or some Tuber, maybe"
stonerrock,37r62k,woodcrafter_stoner,3,Fri May 29 21:37:06 2015 UTC,"was thinking about this for a bit.  you probably want to stay a little mellower at a restaurant than if it was a powerlifting gym, so how about these few suggestions...   monster magnet - blow 'em off kyuss - space cadet sabbath - planet caravan bakerton group - peruvian airspace sasquatch - nikki kyuss - catamaran (yawning man cover) john garcia - her bullets energy gipsy kings - hotel california (gotta get a little more flamenco after that last one) clutch - ghost qotsa - i never came monster magnet - black balloon kyuss - phototropic leaf hound - deception then at closing time just put on the giraffes - having fun and kick everyone the fuck out"
stonerrock,37r62k,tastejustlikechicken,1 point,Fri May 29 23:10:14 2015 UTC,ill have to check all these out tomorrow. thanks dude
stonerrock,37r62k,SolidGold54,1 point,Sat May 30 05:37:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like instrumentals might be more suitable for a restaurant. You could try these by Fatso Jetson. Tutta Dorma El Taurino Highway 86 Heavenly Hearse Corn On The Macabre    If you are looking for more lively stuff, there are many more options.  E: I also have to recommend this one simply because it's my favorite song from Desert Sessions and it's so damn good. More people hearing it is a good thing. Goin' To A Hangin'"
