I feel incredibly lucky as I started university one year before the fee hikes. I studied with the Open University and have barely had to pay anything due to grants for low income. Even with the Open Uni, which is significantly cheaper than a regular university, had I been just one year younger I would now be £15000 in debt. That's the difference just one year in age makes, or one gap year, whatever...starting off your life with no debt, vs starting with thousands.   Yes in America students are always in debt from studying. And maybe that will from now on be the case in the UK. But to grow up being told university is the only way to go (and if you're not a completely rubbish student, most schools will push you into going to uni), and thinking that you would get grants or minimal loans...to suddenly realising that you will come out of it in debt for your whole life...that's jarring.  And to be honest university doesn't guarantee anything these days. When my parents went to uni - my mum was the first in her family to do so - they were pretty much guaranteed a job afterwards. A lot of their school year didn't go to university. But now, most school leavers go to uni, having a degree is nothing special - and will leave you in masses of debt - but it's expected of you."

(So... imagine cutting F2 jobs but keeping F1 intake the same)   The problem is it is easier to demonise doctors.

BritishPolitics,3dx5h5,ocularsinister2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:24:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't consider that such a hurdle. Churchill was 66 when he became PM for the first time in 1940, and and 77 when he become PM for the second time in 1951, and by the time that term as PM ended in 1955 Churchill would be about 81. A comparable example is Clement Attlee, who was 62 when becoming PM in 1945 and 68 when his term as PM ended in 1951. Additionally, there was Harold Macmillan who was 69 at the time of stepping down from being PM in 1963.   The point I'm trying to get across, is that even in the crazy times of the mid 20th century, when healthcare, nutrition and medical knowledge were no where near the standards they are now, we had many PMs who were comparable to Jeremy Corbyn's age. And with all the medical advancements, I'd say that they could even be a bit older.   It's just that a change took place in our society whereby we expect our PMs to be much, much younger and more energetic. Personally I wish we'd return to the older style. It might give some of our prime ministerial candidates a chance to gain some much needed experience. At the moment they barely have time to get their degree from Oxbridge and become a parliamentary advisor before they get given a seat to contend. If we didn't start making them MPs so fast (and then front pagers, and then PMs) they might have a chance to actually do something. Churchill had a messy career as both a journalist and navy man before becoming an MP. Attlee as well was trained as a lawyer and didn't even enter politics in a significant way until after the First World War in his late thirties. The wealth of experience these people brought to their job was immense in comparison to what our PMs have now."

If one man has a set of beliefs / values it does not doom an entire party. The way democracy works is by getting an overall consensus. Corbyn could be a new Castro, Guevara, Stalin, whatever, but his policies, white papers etc still have to be voted on. The whips still have to do the work, and if the party doesn't like it (or the House, should it ever come to that) then the policy being voted on will be voted out.  However, all the while the meeja relies on personal attacks to get the message across it'll all go horribly wrong. Miliband could have been a great PM (or not, I'm just hypothesising) but the general media just went ""oh, doesn't he look weird!?! How can we let this weirdo into no. 10?

Corbyn could release a budget (if he got elected to government) that could shaft the entire nation without any opposition in the commons.  The media wasn't the only reason Miliband lost, come on now.

I'd love to see him win the leadership, provide a compelling alternative to the Tory narrative and go on to win the GE, and see Tory laughter turn to tears. I think that's at least as likely as a moderate/Tory lite candidate winning by largely going along with what the Tories are saying (and further disenfranchising anyone on the left in the process), and it would more worthwhile to actually have two opposing parties rather than two very similar ones that offer no real choice."

BritishPolitics,3dv563,swug3,4,Sun Jul 19 23:44:10 2015 UTC,"Currently, foreign students have four or so months after their courses end, during which they can find work and apply to change their visa to a working one from within the UK, which is relatively cheap and easy, and employers do not need to prove they have looked across the entire EU for similarly competent workers in order to hire them. The Tories' plans will remove this, making students go home more or less as soon as their studies are finished, which makes getting work and a working visa many times more difficult (as applying for a visa from outside the UK is more expensive and more difficult, employers need to prove that a non-EU worker is the only option for them, you have to completely end your life here, leave and then come back and restart it which is at best inconvenient and at worst impossible).   I have heard through the grapevine that at some universities, the Home Office has retroactively changed a number of degree students' visas so that they end (and the students must leave) literally a couple of days past their graduation. With a couple of months' notice. That sets a nice tone, huh?"

Sincere question: don't they already have that right anyway?   Appearing on Channel 4 News on Friday, Mr Farron, who beat Norman Lamb to the leadership, was asked three times if he believed homosexual sex was a sin.  Each time, he refused to give a direct answer, instead choosing to say ""my firm belief is we are all sinners"".   Not much wrong with that. It's pretty consistent with Christian theology and suggests he doesn't want to mix his politics and faith. If you want to see a person who gladly mixes politics and faith see Nadine Dorries."
BritishPolitics,3dx5rr,cbfw86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:05:19 2015 UTC,"Sincere question: don't they already have that right anyway?   The main issue is that if you are married, you have to obtain your spouse's permission to obtain a Gender Recognition Certificate (which alters your legal gender and grants various legal protections).  That made sense when a GRC meant automatic divorce, but now it has no real impact on your spouse.  Since coming out as trans quite often leads to relationship breakdown, the worry is that some people might decide to hold their spouse's legal gender to ransom during the divorce process.  The government was really determined to keep the ""spousal veto"" in place but didn't really offer any justification.   Not much wrong with that.   Homophobia motivated by religion is no less harmful than the other kind, so why is it any more deserving of respect?   If you want to see a person who gladly mixes politics and faith see Nadine Dorries.   Tim Farron has a very poor voting record on LGBT rights, and has consistently voted against abortion and embryology.  I think it's safe to say that he does mix politics and faith, but has recently realised that this is now incompatible with being leader of the Lib Dems."
BritishPolitics,3dx5rr,eannbz,2,Mon Jul 20 10:28:27 2015 UTC,In my view it's only homophobia if the disapproval/bigotry is acted upon. Only then does it become discrimination. Otherwise you stray into thought policing territory.
BritishPolitics,3dx5rr,cbfw86,2,Mon Jul 20 14:08:02 2015 UTC,"Sincere question: don't they already have that right anyway?   It is argued that the ""spousal veto"", which states that if one partner applies for a gender recognition certification, the spouse must give permission for the marriage to continue. This is considered discriminatory as it effectively creates a barrier for those seeking gender recognition by effectively having to seek permission to change gender.  The government's justification for this ""this is necessary as it would be unfair to the spouses of transgender people for their marital status to be to be changed to a same sex marriage without their specific consent."" (even though same sex and different sex marriage are supposed to be the same in the eyes of the law but whatever...).  Of course, some would argue this shouldn't be a problem - you need to have transitioned for 2 years before you can apply for a gender recognition certificate, so if the spouse wasn't okay with it, that issue would have been sorted by then... However, the argument is that it is about the principle - the statement that the spouse has more say over the status of the marriage than the transgender person.  On an aside, trans folk (quite rightly) take issue with the legal requirement to disclose their gender history to potential spouses else it is considered ""sex by deception"". Whilst obviously relationships are built on trust, the trans community believe that it should ultimately be up to the person to decide how much of their history they would like to disclose with the people they are sleeping with, and that this is similar to racial purity laws in Nazi Germany (which required a spouse to disclose their full family history in order to get married).  tl;dr The remaining issues are essentially about recognising that a transgender person is a person with self-autonomy and that their spouse shouldn't have more say over their relationship than they do."
BritishPolitics,3dx5rr,gamas,2,Mon Jul 20 10:36:51 2015 UTC,"It is argued that the ""spousal veto"", which states that if one partner applies for a gender recognition certification, the spouse must give permission for the marriage to continue.   Surely that  a) protects the spouse of the transgender person, and b) speeds up the divorce process.  If a man turns around and says that they've secretly always been a woman, why should the wife be forced to remain in the marriage to someone they might well feel they no longer know (and may never have really known, thus rendering the entire marriage a lie)? Additionally, why should the wife have to go through conventional divorce proceedings which are laborious and difficult enough as it is?  In essence, the spouse already has a say in whether the marriage is allowed to continue. Why nullify the quick-win option?   This is considered discriminatory as it effectively creates a barrier for those seeking gender recognition by effectively having to seek permission to change gender.   I don't see how that's the case. If a man gets a sex change and it's likely that the spouse will trigger a divorce, then it's pretty obvious from the get-go that he's going to have to choose whether he wants to end his marriage anyway.   On an aside, trans folk (quite rightly) take issue with the legal requirement to disclose their gender history to potential spouses else it is considered ""sex by deception"".   Here I disagree. People should have the right to know the sexual history of a potential spouse.  This right here is where I get tired of the LGBT-plus lobby. Other people have rights as well, as well as their own emotional, mental, and spiritual health. You can't dupe someone into having sex with you and then have them find out years later that you were born a guy. That can't be a moral course of action."

A person's sex history should be no different. The point is, it shouldn't be ""duping someone into having sex with you"", because what a person was in the past shouldn't change who they are now."

BritishPolitics,3dx5rr,gamas,2,Mon Jul 20 10:56:44 2015 UTC,"It's not irrelevant. At all. And I'm not going to be coaxed into talking about sex in some way that will get me laughed at in defence of the sensible position. I will simply say that sex involves more than one person and there is the health and rights of the other person(s) to include too. Sex is an act of giving and receiving of your innermost self, and to find out that the person to whom you were giving and from whom you were receiving was not who you thought they were would leave very real emotional scars on the minds of some people. There are countless people out there who simply do not believe that biological sex is a feeling or a choice, and those people in particular would struggle to come to terms with why they were lied to. I would imagine most people would. People should have a right to know if the sex partner has had a sex change in the past. The emotional and mental fallout of ""sex by deception"" should not be taken lightly, nor should it be trumped by the right ('right') of trans people to deny their own past. It is simply not the same thing as race or anything else. There is serious risk the the health of the sex partner when taken from a holistic point of view.  All that to say nothing of the fact that it could very well pave the way for revenge killings."

There are reasons for this; one is the social stigma of it, which I feel comes from other girls. The whole judging society created (by girls themselves) in the 10-21 age bracket is what hurts  the discussion of stuff like porn the most in girls.  So how do we tackle this?  One, stop saying its bad to watch porn, its not. Its perfectly fine (in moderation of course)  Two, create a sexual education curriculum that actually talks about not only sex but the whole aspect of relationships, body image, fetish's e.t.c  Three- Our societies current fixation on celebrities- PEOPLE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP HERO WORSHIPPING PEOPLE LIKE KIM KARDASHIAN OR OTHER CELEBRITIES (AND TALENTLESS HACKS). Their entire image is fake, its all airbrushed and countless sessions at the gym which are normally quite unhealthy.  A nice quote from Tyrion that should really make some rounds when dealing with body image e.t.c.  Four: Lets not blame one gender or another (since this pieces likes to view men in a bad light). The only way we can tackle issues is by working together, no matter who you are. Once we start discussions on what its like to be and man, and be a women, we can start to create an understanding between the sex's and by doing this, we can work to tackle issues.

Same goes for the NHS, they don't need it, so they don't like it, and don't like paying for it, and they've got friends in the media who'll keep on printing bullshit to try to sway public opinion.  Make cuts, watch the service deteriorate, and then tell the public it's not performing well enough and we need to replace it."

In ten years half of these people won't even remember who Ed Miliband is, just like few people now remember IDS or Michel Howard as Tory leader.  Labour will, I suspect, do a little better at the next election than at the previous one (just as, actually, they did a little better in England at this election than they did in the previous one). It won't be enough to get them into power in all likelihood, but I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Labour government in 2025.  As the saying goes, oppositions don't win elections, governments lose them.  Was Tony Blair an excellent politician? Sure - just as Thatcher before him, he won a lot of people over who otherwise wouldn't have shifted. But his victory was mostly down to the collapse of the Tories after Black Friday and the confusion and muddiness of the last couple of years of Major's government. I don't doubt that even someone like Foot could have scraped a majority in 97.  There was this thinking before the election that Labour could somehow walk into office after only five years, but we had a sitting government who had presided over an economic recovery. Let's not pretend shock that the incumbency effect is strong.  Maybe labour will get in next time - we'll have to wait and see how badly things go for the Tories. If they manage to keep things more or less ticking along, expect that random hand of fate to intervene by 2025 if only due to the odds of something going wrong by then."

The fundamental difference being that the SNP, Greens and UKIP weren't major forces back then. People just bounced back and forth between Labour and Tory, going to Lib Dems if they wanted to object to two-party politics.  If people continue to be willing to vote for smaller parties, Labour's loss may be permanent. Labour's problem is that it's a huge coalition of rather diverse political views brought together by opposition to the Tories. That means no matter what line they take, they will always leave some groups unhappy. They're losing working class ""salt of the earth"" types to UKIP, they're losing their left wing to the Greens, they've lost all of Scotland to the SNP.  The Lib Dems are in good shape in comparison.

That it took a threatened lawsuit in 2003 before they would even allow NI citizens to join the Labour Party shows they are entirely comfortable with the idea that the separatist SDLP as a de-factor sister party rather than simple one with shared policies.

Heavy praise for both his opponent, Norman Lamb, and Nick Clegg, as well as general praise for the Coalition Focus on regaining power  Heavily interested in decentralisation of power (which has been distinctive Lib Dem policy ever since the Orange Book) Targeting next year's local council election  Praises individualism, entrepreneurship and criticises unnecessary state interference. (All tenets of right wing, neo-liberalism) However, extremely heavy emphasis that poverty and dependence destroyed freedom. (The defining characteristic of new-liberalism, the left wing branch of the ideology).    Other themes which were touched upon    Housing (wants more housing to be provided, mentioned several times) Immigration 'blessing not a curse' (mentioned at least twice) Praises Tolerance (mentioned about four times, possibly more, emphasising difference aspects of tolerance in different parts of the speech)     All in all it was a very promising speech. He's obviously positioning himself now as the leader of the whole party, not just his branch. The issues he brought up are extremely hot button issues of the moment, and place the Lib Dems as the polar opposite of (small 'c') conservatism, especially as found in UKIP. Even the branch of liberalism that Farron is shifting the party away from the types of liberalism which have had influence over UKIP and the Conservative Party. So he seems to have located the party on a firm footing in terms of policy, which will allow them to regain their distinctiveness, rather than just being ""the party which was in a coalition but now isn't.""  As an aside, he does seem to be a reasonable good public speaker. That does need to be tempered with caution though. He wasn't perfect. He's much more charismatic than the Labour leadership candidates, and his accent and at least demonstrating that he has a sense of humour make him much more human, but his jokes were often a little off and he seemed to have difficulty reading the crowd. Not bad, but, he's not Winston Churchill either.   Interestingly, no mention of his christian faith. Would have liked to hear about that a bit, but oh well. He's obviously trying to down play it. That was the only real ""elephant in the room"" typed topic. He abstained on the Equal Marriage vote, and there's a few other strange blips in his personal voting record. That's obviously one of the Lib Dem's main achievements in government. A majority of Tory MPs voted against the motion, and they would never have put it on the Parliamentary time table if the Lib Dems weren't part of the government. It's really something that they can shout about, but if Farron doesn't feel he is able to because of his personal abstention and uncertainty on the grounds of his faith, then that's going to somewhat shoot the Lib Dems in the foot at a time when they need all the ammunition they can get (which makes it doubly worse that they're wasting it on their own feet).  Apart from that, I think this speech was very clear of the sort of leader Farron wants to be, and it looks promising. I look forward to seeing him campaign in the local elections and seeing him speak in Parliament now that he's leader."
